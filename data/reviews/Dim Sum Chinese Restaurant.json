{"text":"If you are looking for a professional, clean place to eat do not go here.  They are super rude, the place is very dirty, and the food is not fresh.  We were super disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good food and great service.  I haven't tried Dragon Court yet so I can't compare them, but I would come back here again.

You don't see stuffed duck's feet, jelly fish, chicken feet w/ black bean sauce, and beef tripe with black bean sauce many places I have been except for San Fran.

All the standards of course, like har gow shrimp dumplings, rice nooodle crepes, 8 treasure sweet rice with lotus leaf (which we had yesterday and it was quite good.)

I look forward to checking out Dragon Court on my next trip :-)"}
{"text":"Love my Dim Sum ! Have tried dim sum in LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Vancouver, NYC, Atlanta, Maryland, Minnesota, Orlando and Toronto. Definitely go on weekends. more so on Saturday when its freshest ! Enjoyed all the dumplings."}
{"text":"Go for Sunday lunch when the carts are being pushed around like race cars.  Bring the kids and turn them on to different food.  Try the leek dumplings and the salt and pepper calamari.  Tasty little suckers.  Not quite like being in Chinatown in NYC but for Charlotte, it's as close as you can get.  They celebrate Chinese New Year the first Sunday in February and two years ago, there was this evil white dude sitting on top of the restaurant throwing firecrackers down on the performers.  What the ?!?  But I guess he knew the owners because they saw him and let him keep doing it.  By the way, you can get in and out of this place in about 5 minutes.  Everything is super fast.  It gets really busy at around 12 noon on Sunday, so go a bit early or on the late side.  And the kiddies get free lollipops after the meal."}
{"text":"While some of the pieces are obviously pre-made and maybe even frozen, the majority of the dim sum is darn good. Is it \"Dim Sum a Go-Go\" in NYC good? No, but this is Charlotte, so come on people. The char siu bow is awesome and only available on weekends, as are the other baked items.

We were there on a Sunday around noon, and it filled up quickly, but the carts were moving the entire time and we didn't have to wait for our favorites to make their way around.

The menu items looked really good as they were being delivered to the tables around us--not your typical Americanized deep fried stuff. I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"So, so, so delicious and just as friendly.  We ordered dumplings, pork buns, Peking duck and a noodle dish, incredible!!"}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Chinese Dim Sums I've been to in Charlotte. The leek dumplings, chicken feet, and steamed rice noodles w/shrimp tastes the same like I remembered it 10 years ago. Food is bit pricey but compared to other places it's good. It's really busy on weekends"}
{"text":"The exterior is not attractive.  The food is more than fine for Charlotte standard. I waited for 10 min for my take-out.  Really not that bad except of course, you have to appreciate the authenticity of this place--in the mist of Vietnamese town and all.

The price is on the expensive side and I was fortunate enough to have enjoyed cheap and more delicious food in SF and LA. But this will do as far as fixing my craving goes..."}
{"text":"Beware - super ghetto.  Fortunately the food is pretty good.  Things to try:
ma po tofu, salt and pepper squid, black beans clams, and the lobster.  The rice could be better quality, along with the crysantymum tea...I think I had bugs in mine the last time.  But the food is tasty enough to come back."}
{"text":"I went by here today with my SO and his mum, and it was pretty good! My 4-star review is situational, I would totally consider it 4 for Charlotte, but it is solid-passable 2-3 star maybe compared to the the dim sum palaces in Toronto, Vancouver and HK proper. There were enough options circling for the pescetarian in our group to put together a meal, and I took home a roast duck plate for later, yum! Prices seemed a little high but that's ok, I do wish they had a menu of what they could bring out from the kitchen since my Cantonese is... rusty, to say the least, and I assume out of politeness my interactions with the staff were mostly in english so nobody at the table would feel left out."}
{"text":"Please try this place, it's hella yummy. I ordered the chicken with garlic sauce add  $3 shrimp. Talking about a blessing!  Great spot for large parties."}
{"text":"I grew up eating dim sum in Hong Kong and also lived in NYC for years.  So when I moved to CLT I was dying to find a good place for semi-decent dim sum to satisfy my cravings.  However, having given this place its fair number of chances, I've now given up and have resorted to buying frozen dim sums and mastered my own won ton dumplings at home to beat those cravings.

In short, the dim sum is by far the worst I've had in my liffe, and they don't even come out warm.  Service is horrible even to Chinese customers.  The owner with the short hair has an attitude problem.  However, being the only dim sum place in town (Dragon Court doesn't even count with such a miserable location and setup), I suppose they can get away with anything, food quality or sanitation-wise.  

Whenever we get a chance to visit NYC or HK we order dim sum like there's no tomorrow.  I am ashamed to tell our friends why."}
{"text":"This place serves both dim sum and a regular menu, and I would have to say it's the best dim sum I've found in North Carolina.  They offer many great authentic dishes as well as some tamer, more Americanized options.  Great service too.  Lunch on Sundays can be very busy, but the staff works quickly to seat you as soon as possible."}
{"text":"You would be better off going to a Asian store and buying frozen dim sum. Price was ridiculous for dim sum and the area and quality totally not worth going! Was very disappointed . I have had plenty of Dim Sum all over the country. Would not recommend this to anyone who knows Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Great dim sum place. My fianc√© and I always come to eat here whenever we've got the chance passing by charlotte. The roasted duck is great! It's a good Togo to take home for dinner."}
{"text":"I went  on Sunday with My son. I arrived about 11:25 there were three group ahead of us ,no problem .They have You sign in yourself on the back of take out menu and stand around the register/front door..After 20 minutes the groups were seated so we were next about then  a couple came in and signed in then in minutes they were seated ahead us  so after standing for 25 minutes we left. I called and told them they needed a better system ,like a maybe they write the name or  give you a number ..disappointing"}
{"text":"The server stepped on my foot while we were waiting to be seated. She acted as if she didn't feel anything. No apology at all!"}
{"text":"So I was pretty scared trying this place based on some of the prior reviews (smells of dirty dish rags, etc..) but I was pleasantly surprised at both the food, cleanliness, and service. No the dim sum is not as good as in San Fran or NYC china towns, but this is Charlotte ( I mean our claim to culinary fame is Price's Chicken coop). I personally thought the Shu Mai (shrimp and pork dumplings) were very comparable to what Ive had in San Fran, and the steamed pork buns were also very good. I was craving Dim Sum and this place did not let me down. I will say that I was hoping they would have a Dim Sum cart going around so you could pick and choose from what looked good, but they did have pictures alongside of some of the dim sum to help in the selection process."}
{"text":"Food was not as amazing as I would have expected based on some of the other reviews. It was 3 star at best. 

What ruined the experience for me was the service. When ordering hot tea for one person they give one teapot and charge for one tea. When ordering hot tea for 4 people, they give you one pot and charge for 4 teas. When confronted about this we were ignored. 

When we tried to order more food we waited for the waiter for 15 min before we decided to raise our hands to get their attention. That didn't work and we tried to call for the waiter which didn't work also. I eventually had to get up and approach one of the waiters which I think is unacceptable for any restaurant with waiters.

When we got the bill they had already put on a 20% tip. I would have been ok with this if we had gotten service worthy of that much tip. I am unashamed to say that I left enough cash to cover 10%, which is generous relative to the service received that night. 

Spend your money elsewhere. It's not worth this kind of treatment."}
{"text":"I had the Dim Sum with the family, about 10 of us.  The Dim Sum is good not great.  If we were in LA, NY, or San Francisco this place would get 2 stars, but for Charlotte it's a 4.  I don't think there are many options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Dim sum was ok.  Chung Funn was not good."}
{"text":"We came in 40 minutes to their posted closing time and was given the hmm should we sit em or not look and thankfully they showed us to a table. The food is definitely not spectacular and hygiene in kitchen is probably non existent but you have to forget about that if you want to enjoy some dim sum on a random evening. Food was good but even better with the killer hot chilli oil they have on the table. Dont come here for the service- our waitress gave a rude \"hhmph!\" when we asked for a to go box. But when youre craving Chinese and you wanna feel sleepy beepy from MSG come here! (Feels so wrong but so good)"}
{"text":"Our family was visiting Charlotte and I had an enormous craving for dim sum.  Especially since the dim sum offerings in Pittsburgh leave quite a bit to be desired.

We stopped in on a weekday for lunch so that means that you can have dim sum if you want, but you have to order off a menu instead of picking off a steam cart.  The steam cart and the delicious desserts are for the weekends only.  Darn.

However, even though we had to order off the menu, everything ... and I mean EVERYTHING ... we ordered was delicious.  Not one clunker amongst the bunch.

So, here's what we ordered:

Siu Mai (pork and shrimp dumplings, steamed)
Stuffed bean curd (fried tofu with shrimp)
Pork bun (steamed) 
Sharkfin dumpling - perfect
Fried dumpling - also perfect
Spring roll (chicken) - yep, perfect
Sesame ball - my kids loved this

Again, everything we ordered was excellent and the service was quite attentive and cheerful.  Our pre-tip total came to $32 for our family of 4.

I wish I lived closer to this little gem of a place.  But for tourists who ended up here thanks to Yelp, this was a highlight for me on this trip!"}
{"text":"I was told I *needed* to come here and get dim sum as soon as I got into town. Never one to turn down tasty Chinese foods, my cousin and I met up with two friends for lunch.

Our friend, a regular at this place, put himself in charge of ordering dim sum for all of us. Knowing he knew his stuff and also too lazy to care, we trusted him. He ordered shrimp shu mai, fried taro dumplings, fried pork dumplings, chicken and pork buns, taro shrimp, and stuffed eggplant.

The fried pork dumplings were much bigger than the ones I'm used to from Prosperity Dumpling back home, but still good. The wrappers were still thin and the filling was legit. I enjoyed the stuffed eggplant, and the shu mai was okay (I am not a huge fan of shrimp shu mai for whatever reason). 

Despite that goodness, our meal was a bit disappointing. We asked for chili oil and were told they were out. Needless to say, everyone at the table was upset. Even if they made their own and ran out somehow, they could have hit up any of the 373958 Asian markets on Central (like the one next door!) to get a temporary supply. Later, we learned they did not have any chicken and pork buns, so were given regular pork buns as a substitute. Our taro dumplings, which I usually love, were crispy, but were not cooked through. My friend mused that his was cold. I bit into mine and upon first bite, nearly burnt the roof of my mouth. However, my next bite was lukewarm. 

The prices here were okay and the service was good, but I felt it didn't live up to the hype. I would like to give it another chance, but I'm not going to go out of my way to get back there when there are so many other places to eat in this city."}
{"text":"I came here while on a trip to NC!! Unforgettable because their hot and sour soup is UNLIKE any other!! I am obsessed over Hot & Sour soup so yeah...it DOESN'T really taste like hot & sour soup...but it IS SO good! 2.94$ for a small bowl, I really recommend it...It comes with the fried noodle you put in. BTW their fortune cookies they give out at the end doesn't have trans fat. Plus they were sooo good, unlike the typical fortune cookies given here in CA. I am not exaggerating . 
Besides that, me and my friends got steamed buns...they were OK.
Staff are super friendly and memorable, despite the fact that we just ordered soup and steamed buns and didn't take any recommendations (we had to eat steak in a few hrs so..). I wish I could try more things..the menu look so tasty and the soups tasted really high quality.  Would pay for an NC ticket again to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is not too bad for Charlotte.  I have been to Dragon Court and find them comparable."}
{"text":"This dim sum is for real.  I'm mainly gonna rave about how I like the food.  The ambience is simple (like most Chinese restaurants I've ever seen) and it's true you will see a lot of Chinese people dining here, which is always a vote of confidence in my book.  You can also get take-out, which is usually what I do, and enjoy your gluttony in privacy.

So back to the food, after reminiscing a second.  Summertimes growing up we used to visit relatives in San Francisco and eat dim sum in Chinatown.  Short of traveling halfway around the world, I have to think that dining in a big-city Chinatown restaurant is about as authentic as it gets.  When I moved to Charlotte I was so happy to find a restaurant that served this cuisine and thought it was amazing--the variety, the authenticity, and the overwhelming yumminess!  But a part of me doubted my judgment since maybe my childhood pork bun memories are hazy.

Recently I went back to San Fran and had dim sum, lots of different dishes, and I thought, \"Huh, this tastes exactly like the one in my neighborhood.\"  Score for Plaza Midwood and Charlotte!  So if you love dim sum, but have wondered if this could be any good, try it!"}
{"text":"Typical atmosphere. I had the Singapore noodles and the have tried 15 plus of the dim sum dumplings. They were all pretty good. I did not like the dim sum crepe it was to thick and slimy and I feel some kind guilt that they offer shark fin. Over all I recommend."}
{"text":"Good food that is more authentic than your average chinese restaurant. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The new Dim Sum is great. All the stuff I ordered at the prior restaurant is still there, same great taste and artful dumpling preparation. The carpet is new, chairs reupholstered, walls painted with new sconces. Gotta say I missed the waitstaff with the ongoing feud who were periodically rude to customers. The family who now seems to be in charge, they were so sweet and professional I hardly knew what to do with myself! We highly recommend the pan fried dumplings and pork roast buns. Thanks Dim Sum for opening back up!"}
{"text":"Driving back to Atlanta from RTP with Colleagues from Asia and they really wanted Chinese.

These guy feed me like a king when I am on their turf so the pressure was on. PF Chang was not really what they needed so I hit yelp and one of the other guys pulled Trip Advisor and he found this place.

We ordered 5 Dim Sum dishes, all stuff that couldn't have been bought frozen. All great.

Ordered Singapore Curried Noodles and a crazy large serving of Seafood Hor Fun. Both where fantastic. Also had a couple simple veg dishes that where Wok'd just right.

The place is not very appealing from the street. When you get inside it is very old school Chinese and pretty dated but I like it that way. The d'core was just like most of the places we eat in in South China and South East Asia.

My friends loved the food and especially the authenticity. They liked having \"real\" food for breakfast too. Like I said the Hor Fun was really big!!!!!

If you want a fancy setting go to PF Chang. If you want really authentic and high quality Dim Sum and Cantonese Chinese, this is the place.

It is in my GPS now for my next trip to RTP."}
{"text":"i think this is a good place to dim sim. maybe i carried low expectation to try it out. but the taste is fine?you cant compare it with dim sim places in nyc or la, but i m from alt i think its not bad. for people live in charlotte and like dim sim, probably the best choice."}
{"text":"Dim Sum appears to have really gone down hill over the last few years in terms of cleanliness and food quality.  A few nights ago we ordered take out - just one order of sesame chicken.  Got it home and it was way undercooked / raw.  Instead of nice crispy and brown on the outside it was soggy and pink.  No way anyone with the least amount of care should have let it go out of the kitchen.  We are sadly done with Dim Sum and will not be going back.  If you want decent Chinese try Soho Bistro in uptown."}
{"text":"TURN AROUND. DO NOT COME HERE.

ABSOLUTELY BAD. HORRIBLE.

TURN AWAY NOW.

Zero Stars.

The food is cold and they will over charge you like crazy.

$70 for 8 items? Seriously?!

C'mon.. I get it, but c'mon. The food isn't even that great.."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING but the service SUCKS. They treat me like shit. Is it because I look young? It is crazy how they treat me.. I go there twice or three times a week, but lately, its only to go- cause i really cant stand they way they talk to me, ESPECIALLY the girl in the RECEPTION. And they would still be rude to me. I was gonna do my graduation party over there (graduated from CPCC)- it was gonna be 37 pple which is good business for them, but after the way they treated me today, HELL NO!!! Because I can tolerate everything, except pple disrespecting me."}
{"text":"We drove all the way from Raleigh (3 hour drive) to eat at this place. We came at 9:00pm thirty minutes before closing. There were quite a few customers in there at the time. As we walked in an older lady shouted we are closed to us and shoo-ing us out the door. We were all upset and about to leave then she throws a paper at us telling us hurry up and order standing there rushing us saying come on hurry up and order. We did not drive all the way to charlotte for this kind of service so we left and didn't even get to eat. We did not appreciate being rushed and forced to order something quickly especially if it's our first time here."}
{"text":"I was very sad when the original closed down but I think these guys are doing a great job. The menu is a little smaller but they still have all of my favorites! The food was just as good as the original dim sum and didn't take forever to come out like the other reviewers commented. Also, I don't eat pork and when a fried taro dish came out with pork in it the server I realized that I couldn't eat it, told me that it contained pork and then went and got me the same dish made with shrimp instead, which I appreciated.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and experienced sub-par food and terrible service. First of all, the food came out really slow for a mid afternoon lunch and hardly any customers. Second, there was a really long hair coiled around a fried dumpling just under the skin and was clearly visible from the outside. I called over the waitress to bring it to her attention and she simply grabbed the plate and left. There was no apology or acknowledgement of the tainted food. We weren't sure if she was going to bring us a new batch or comp the charge so we just ended up waiting for an eternity before she came back.

She brought three new dumplings, but my group was too disgusted with the food and the service to even look at them. We asked for the check and another lady (I assume a manager) came to speak with us. She asked us if everything was okay and if there were any problems. She made it seem like the hair incident hadn't been brought to her attention so I mentioned that there was a hair in our food. She rudely answered that she already knew this. So...why did you ask us if we had any problems if you already knew about the issue?? Nevertheless, she gave us a thoughtless, mechanical apology and comped us for only one of the two orders of dumplings even though we didn't eat either of the orders.

All in all, I was extremely disappointed in the way they handled the situation and I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Even though Dim Sum is a 5 minute walk from our house we go across town to a different restaurant.  When we moved to Charlotte 6 years ago we tried Dim Sum & it was horribly greasy & unedible. A few years later we tried it again, still greasy.

We went last week and the food was totally different, possibly the best chicken fried rice I've ever had. It took forever for our food to come out since there were 4 or 5 huge (10+ people) & there was only cook.  

The only negative was a crazy fight that broke out behind us about a crying child."}
{"text":"Ugh, this food is horrible. How can so many people like this place?!?!?! Went to dim sum here on a saturday morning and it was very empty. There were only about 3 carts going around and only went around ONCE.  I had to ask someone to come over and help us, but they only ended up bringing a specific plate over than the carts again. Oily stomach lining, slippery wontons....I feel like vomiting just writing about it."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for well over a decade and although I should be fluent in Cantonese, I'm not. However, I know the essentials... the names of all my favorite dim sum dishes. Luckily, you don't need to speak mandarin or Cantonese to order here and if you're not sure of what something is the servers are very helpful.

If you're looking for the traditional dim sum experience, you'll need to come here on the weekend because they only have the carts out then. You can still order dim sum any other day but it's a la carte and in my opinion, not their A game. They also have a bunch of menu options if you're looking for some specialty items or American Chinese dishes but can't comment on these because they do a bang up job on their dim sum and that's all I ever get.

Now onto the food, it's no simple task to be able to prepare so many different dishes, especially on a busy Saturday or Sunday morning so I have a huge amount of respect for the cooks. You really can't go wrong here and my favorites are their BBQ pork buns(both steamed and baked are delicious), har gow (shrimp dumplings), rice rolls with little dried shrimp, chicken feet (don't hate), eggplant with shrimp paste, and pretty much anything with their fried shrimp paste in it. Everything has great flavor, texture, overall deliciousness. As others have mentioned, they're tapas sized so you'll have the opportunity to try plenty of food; they're a couple bucks per plate. All that with some jasmine tea and I'm a happy camper."}
{"text":"This is very good Dim Sum. Unless you're going to Toronto, Washington DC or New York City it doesn't get better than this in North America. I am looking forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"The food was not the best Dim Sum I have ever had, but it was decent especially considering the area has little from which to choose. The service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"I reserved my comment as I'm real Chinese British  heritage from Hong Kong.  I've tons of Chinese cooking knowledge in the industry as well as I've many chances of traveling to LA.

I visited this place as my sister came out of state. 

This place has changed management with a slight remodeling of the place to look nicer.

They served some of the dim sums that we could  have much more in any restaurants in LA.

The quality is ok!  I attached a price list for information in case those who are preparing to spend some good time there."}
{"text":"The food gets no complaints from me.  When you can end up spending more there than in an overpriced San Francisco- Chinatown restaurant, something is really wrong!"}
{"text":"Being big Dim Sum fans and having tried it in multiple large cities across the country, we can honestly say that this restaurant was fantastic! We had been there quite a few times when it was owned by the previous owner and were hesitant to try it based on the reviews since it changed hands. We are so glad we went to see and taste for ourselves.  The dim sum carts were rolling and had plenty of delicious offerings, many of which were even better than under the previous owner. We had the Turnip Cake with Chinese Sausage, Taro Stick on Shrimp Biscuit, Fried Sesame Balls, Steamed Roast Pork Bun, Roast Duck, Fried Crispy Shrimp Toast, Stuffed Eggplant, Steamed Chinese Spinach, and Shrimp Rice Noodle Crepe. Everything was outstanding! The Shrimp Rice Noodle Crepe had more flavor than any we've tried before. The service was great and we walked away stuffed! We were one of the few occidentals in the restaurant and that in itself says a lot about the authenticity and high quality of the food.  We arrived at 11:30 and there were very few tables open. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So, obviously, I'm one of those people who doesn't learn from their mistakes.  This time, instead of going into the restaurant for dim sum, we ordered Chinese takeout.  The soups were meh.  Neither the wonton nor the hot and sour soup had much flavor.  

Next came the entrees.  For our family dinner night, we ordered Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Sweet & Sour Chicken entrees.  Neither of the kids cared much for the Sweet & Sour Chicken.  They said it \"tasted funny.\"  They didn't even want to put on the sweet, sticky red sauce that came in a big container on the side.  And what kid doesn't love that?  That's never been an issue before.  My partner had the Orange Chicken which looked and tasted like chicken covered in the exact same red sweet & sour sauce.  He, too, was not thrilled.  Mine was the Sesame Chicken.  It, too, came in what looked like the EXACT SAME red sweet & sour sauce with a few (a very few) sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  I've never had Sesame Chicken that wasn't in a flavorful BROWN sauce and covered in sesame seeds.  Mine, too, was practically flavorless.  The accompanying rice they gave us was pretty dry and sticky.  Lastly, there were no fortune cookies to finish off a below-average meal.  

To top it all off, the restaurant had apparently significantly raised the prices on everything since the last take-out menu we had on hand.  So, when picking up the order, we paid more than expected and the quality was practically non-existent.  

Dim Sum is OFF our list FOREVER for both take-out and dine-in.  As our once-president once said, \"Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me... You can't get fooled again.\""}
{"text":"The food is good, I loved the spare rib, place needs a bigger selection on seafood however; I still recommend this place for dim sum."}
{"text":"It's the only dimsum place in Charlotte. The restaurant is far from nice. It has low ceiling and doesn't have any windows. It offers nice selection of Dimsum food. It's a Chinese breakfast in small plate (kind of like tapas). The food comes in small portion and push in little cart. I find it a little frustrating to communicate with the waitresses with their limited English. Overall, this restaurant offers dimsum."}
{"text":"When you walk in it smells dirty, looks dirty and old. The food is \"OK\". For the dim sum aficionados it might be good, but I won't go again just because of how dirty it looks. If the outside feels looks run down, I can't imagine the kitchen."}
{"text":"My wife is Chinese and I lived in Hong Kong for seven years. 
We are so pleased that there's good dim sum in Charlotte at the \"Dim Sum\" restaurant.
If you go at the weekend there's a good selection and it's served from carts to your table.
The chicken feet with black bean cause is one of our favourites, the shrimp dumplings (Har Gow) are pretty good.
All in all if you can't get to New York or the west coast this is as good as you'll get.
The staff are extremely friendly and if there's a line out the door it's worth joining it."}
{"text":"Came in last night and at first i was a little skeptical but the lady's here are so sweet! The decor is nothing great but I defiantly think it's worth a trip!

So i had come here first (yelp)  to check out the reviews and to see what everyone had liked. So I tried to order some of that to round out our meal. We had ordered a bunch off of the Dim Sum menu and then per Pourinas recommendation had the Chinese Broccoli with the Garlic sauce-Delicious and Fresh it has gone up in price $1 i think but they let you know that upon ordering I was totally fine with it though. Other favorites were the Won Ton Soup- the Won Tons were so good I got one to go for lunch today :) . I also really liked the Taro Shrimp with a lil Soy sauce on them. The Shrimp Dumpling were great along with the Pork Dumplings (HUGE). We had the Sesame Balls which the server said was basically they're dessert during the week because the others aren't served till the weekend...I will be back for more! 

My not so favorite but not at any fault of the cooks but because I had never had them before and the texture was all wrong in my mouth I found it hard to swallow...The Turnip Cakes. They were just kinda gooey and a very strange taste if only you could've seen my face...Priceless. We also had the Pork Steamed Buns and also the Steamed Buns with Chicken and Pork....I'm not sure how I felt about them because they came last to the table and I was already getting full so I really only had a bite of each and the only complaint would be that they're was too much bread around the meat but the flavor seemed to be good.

I would say we had a great dinner and we will definitely be back perhaps with others so we can try more! Our server told us to come in on the weekends to take advantage of the carts going around so that we can pick out what we want based on the way they look too! I'm down for this Saturday just so I can have more!!"}
{"text":"The food is okay. You have to know what to order to get the best of your buck.  Some dishes are a bit overpriced not that I mind it but the portions aren't worth that price. The service is 50/50 they are usually really busy on weekends and the service sucks but sometimes they aren't busy and the service still needs improving. I think it just depends on what kind of waitress/waiter you get. Their stuffed fried taros are pretty good and so is the shrimp crepes. Chicken feet and short pork ribs are also good. I come here often because it is one of the few places we have in CLT and because some reviews on some of the other restaurants make me a bit hesitant to try the others. Lol. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place serves dim sum (like their name states) but that doesn't mean they offer good dim sum.  I think this place stays busy because of the lack of competition in the area for dim sum.  I've had better, much better for the same price in a variety of places around the nation.

I think their dinner service is slightly better than the dim sum.  If you want authentic Chinese food, you can pretty much order whatever you like here.  The food is pretty average but if you have a craving for something special and unique (like your mom or grandmother made for you), you could give it a shot here."}
{"text":"Pretty good Dim sum. Prices a little high for quality. No Cafe or bottled water. Service was good.  Nothing special. I will say that the House fried rice was really yummy. 3 stars."}
{"text":"What a comeback!!! We used to go to this restaurant in the past, but it closed down sometime in 2017. It was sad to hear they closed because the food and service were great! We found out they re-opened, and it's better than it was before! Clean dining room, same friendly staff, and delicious dishes!

We went on a Sunday afternoon and once we were seated, we immediately were greeted with a food cart with dim sum, steamed buns, fried calamari, and more! As you choose items from the cart, they make note on a piece of paper on your table. 

Start by choosing a few items from the cart. As you finish those, they'll be back by to offer more, and you can choose as little or as much as your hunger tells you. When you're finished, simply take your ticket up to the front counter to pay. 

I believe the food cart is a Sunday-only feature, but if you go during another time, you won't be disappointed with the standard menu!"}
{"text":"We were so very sad when this placed closed earlier this year. And at the time, it was closed for good. So, my family was very happy to hear, out of the blue,  it reopened about 4 or 5 months later. 

There were some upgrades to the atmosphere and but basically still the same layout and feel. Everyone looked to be new to us and only a couple of the waiters were carried from the restaurant before the closure. However, the new manager claim that nothing had changed, he stressed it the same restaurant and menu. Hmm... 

No comment on the service since, it was none existence that night. Clearly, the management and wait staff were still trying to figure this out. No one said running a restaurant is easy or straightforward. The challenges and difficulties can be very overwhelming especially for noobies... 

So the dim sum was mostly the same but changed a bit. The overall menu changed slightly but mostly the same but some noticeable changes to some of our favorite. 

The taste and texture of the dishes mostly did change, not quite as good, definitely not as familiar. 

Most alarming, I asked the new manager for some chili oil which I did not see on any tables. The manager told me to hold while he would grab some Sriracha...? I asked again for traditional chili oil and he responded to me that Sriracha is better.... whatever! If I can't get chili oil for my dumplings and dim sum dishes then I would rather not go that the restaurant. 

I hoping the new(old?) management have worked out all it bugs and maybe the food prep as well as. I will try this place again because I am pulling for Dim Sum and want to have at lease some descent dim sum in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I didn't see the restaurant before with the old owner, but it still looks very nice. Very clean and open restaurant. The menu had the usual dim sum items, if they didn't run out of it. We ordered Chinese broccoli, shrimp dumplings, fried bananas, and a few other things that they have run out of. The food they did have was great, fresh and hot. I'm a little disappointed with their customer service though. The workers were very rude. We wanted to go ahead and ask for sauces and cups while we were waiting for our food. We thought it would be helpful for them so they when the food was coming out they wouldn't have to worry about it. But they have a specific way to serve a table. Our requests were interrupted by them saying not yet. Then they would wait a minutes to return and see what we needed. They seemed very annoyed with us. And we did not feel welcomed here."}
{"text":"nice surprise in Charlotte! decent food and good selection. service was friendly"}
{"text":"I came in here with a big group before a show at the Fillmore. The waitress remembered everyone's orders and was even very helpful with menu selection suggestions. I adore dim sum and this was such a find! I would recommend it to anyone and will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a one of a kind experience for dim sum style dishes in Charlotte. When you enter and see so many Asian diners you know the food is authentic and delicious! I hadn't been there in a while so I was very pleasantly surprised by the redecorated dining room. Bright colors livened up the somber tones of an aging restaurant. There were the usual selections with some newer dishes I hadn't tried before. The steamed dumplings and bao are my personal favorites. Wait staff was cordial and knowledgeable. I hope not to wait as long as before to visit again."}
{"text":"Leave it to Charlotte to have a dim sum restaurant NAMED Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant. Only natives understand the complex simplicity of this concept. This is one of two restaurants that serve dim sum in all of Charlotte. Thus, market strategy = all discreetness voided. 

Despite the lack of creativity in the name and competition, the dim sum here is pretty good and actually better than the places I've tried in Atlanta. The dishes are flavorful and the food authentic. My favorites are the fried taro balls and stuffed eggplants.

Sundays are when they push the carts around. I recommend coming early (12pm or earlier) so you'll have dibs on \"the good stuff.\" They always run out of my favorites early. Plus, that's when the food is hot and fresh!"}
{"text":"Dim Sum,. To borrow a phrase from Tracy Jordan, I want to get Dim Sum pregnant. It's a great place to go in the odd time in the middle of the day when you don't know if restaurants take a siesta, they are open straight through. 

They also have house made soy sauce, be sure to ask for some.  I am fine with only ordering dim sum, but my friends wanted some Chinese food too, I was like.... well, how I always am.  Order away!  We had some house fried rice and Szechuan beef, both were pretty darn tasty. This restaurant is everything I love, it's the kind of restaurant you drive by and wonder what it's all about and then you try it and you can't think of any place else.."}
{"text":"I was about to give 4 star until when we checked out we were \"reminded\" to pay additional on tip... 
To the owner- Lady you really don't know how to operation business with customer satisfaction. Don't try to assume people bad by not paying certain amount of tip. In fact we were about to give a good tip and wrote a good review on Yelp since we were so excited finally found a dim sum place in Charlotte. 
However, now you have an unhappy family left your restaurant who is writing a two star review and exploring other dim sum option now..."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend who is Chinese. He was sceptical at first but after trying the dim sum he became a fan. The restaurant has a very nice interior and the atmosphere is very cozy. The staff was very friendly as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today.  It's certainly not like Dim Sum in Los Angeles but had a few tasty nibbles. The pork and shrimp shu mai (sp).  The potstickers were too doughy but the filling was good.  The duck had crispy skin and was ok. Nothing earth shattering. The Char Shu bao was ok but seemed like they may have been frozen. But the flavor was good. We had to try the chicken feet ... Um... Not sure why anyone would want to eat these and trying them did not change my mind. 

The service was good. I would go back to try some of the other Chinese dishes just to give it a try."}
{"text":"This place has reopened under new management and what a spectacular improvement.  While the remodeling improved the appearance what was most heartening was the improved quality of the dim sum!  What once was good was now great!  A nice variety of genuine just made dim sum.  And now they have added the traditional carts on the weekend which is the ideal way to graze and explore.  The dim sum is well priced although they do charge for the tea which is a slight annoyance.  
The staff is enthusiastic and work hard to provide a good customer experience.  The parking in front of the testament is a tight squeeze so you might do better parking on the side.
The previous management used to feature Peking Duck and I noticed it was no longer on the menu.  After such s great lunch I was thinking ahead to trying that.  The owner/manager when asked about this when I was at the cash register paying explained that sometimes the ducks wouldn't sell and the meat was to o dry to use the next day.  I only wish that they would let you order it 24 hours in advance.  I will suggest this next visit.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Reopened under new ownership.  Nice upgrades and very clean.  Staff was very friendly and offered their recommendations.  Food was delicious and priced well."}
{"text":"I learned quick you have to be aggressive here and demand people bring you food if you are ordering dim sum plates. I enjoyed the food and would return to try other items on the menu. We tried sliced pork, meatballs, shrimp noodle, shrimp and bacon wrap, fried dumpling, and something like oxtails.. I would recommend for those who are looking to try something new. It is definitely not Americanized so if you don't like traditional flavors then this place isn't for you."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was not all that great. It took us 15 minutes for an order for a cup of ice to be filled. The pork steam buns were great and I like the Orange Chicken, which seems to be a hard dish to find anyone else making. I'd go again but for take out instead of dining in."}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte From LA and decided to hit Dim Sum up after family request. 

We did take out VS dining in; not your typical nor best way to enjoy Dim Dum but it sounded good considering it being Christmas Day. 

With all due respect- 
It was the worst Dim Sum I've ever had. 
To many items bought to list, ( $110) and everything lacked in flavor. 
We was sent home without sauces; really guys? 

Big disappointment - 

Back to LA China town where Dim Sum is done right!"}
{"text":"A good authentic place to get a good ole dim sum with actual carts being push around with 10/15 small plates ready to serve to you. Tapas style on wheel. I love it! I get to look, pick and they pull. It's fairly cheap per plate. Anywhere from $1.50 to $3.25 per small plate. Of course you can order something off the menu. Like we ordered the whole lobster made in a delicious sinfully yummy garlic sauce. Hot tea has a big flower in it so it's not jasmine tea. I also have notice their customer service have improved alot over the years. Not when they're alway soo busy on Sat/Sunday. If you just sit around and chit/chat, they will literally completely clean your table as a hint hint to show you, hey you got to go.. There's ppl waiting for your table. Lol.. I love this place.. Remind me of what I grew up with. And this is home."}
{"text":"Highly authentic and traditional Chinese food, so good that I'm coming back again one week later. My new go to sport for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Yes, I like this place a lot.
I mean it's real Chinese food, well I should say real HongKong food. I'm not from HK, but I like it. I would recommend the beef pot(I don't know whether this is the right translation.) and all the dim sum there.
Good food and all my friends love it."}
{"text":"Food is average, price is over the roof! You can find way better places than this, and pay a lot better food for $70 for less than 10 tiny plates. This place suck!!! And will charge you extra plates that you did'nt even get.."}
{"text":"Best duck in town I been here many times and always duck is perfect. Special fried rice and the stuff eggplant simple the best this by far the best Chinese restaurant in Charlotte"}
{"text":"The food was horrible the service was worse! The woman with dyed short hair acting as hostess is mean n rude! Can't believe I actually spent money there! Won't go bk as long as I am breathin..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a new owner with new chefs and we are delighted with the quality of the food. The restaurant decor has had a makeover and the service is good and servers friendly. We have moved to Charlotte from the Washington DC area, where we frequently went to Chinese restaurants for dim sum. It is a very pleasant surprise that this restaurant is now as good as the ones in the D.C. area."}
{"text":"I really wasnt blown away but Dim Sum on the two occasions I have done Take Out. I bave tried a few dishes from the menu and I feel like its your average chinese food. They do have a large menu so you have plenty of options! 

I hear that when you dine in you have even more choices! Im dying to try the steam buns! Ill review again once I dine in! 

I wiah so badly they delivered!"}
{"text":"There aren't many places for dim sum in the south. 

A few tips- there is a wait list by the cash register. Write your name and party size down upon arriving. 

The parking lot was packed on a recent weekend but we only waited about 20 minutes. 

Dim sum comes around on carts. There were three different carts recently. All with different options. They do have a full Chinese food menu but you'll need to request it. You can ask what's in each dim sum or just be surprised. 

You bring your yellow slip up front and pay there. 

All in all not bad Chinese food for North Carolina. Tasted very similar so what I've had in Hong Kong and China. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  Now the selection is more limited than the original but prices are higher?  Service is even worse and they need someone who needs to know how to work the credit card machine.  The weekend cart service is ok but they need to do a better job of hitting all the tables.  DO NOT let them put baby in the corner - you'll get passed by every cart.  They have also refused to offer the fried noodles for the soups which is weird and also no more honeydew sliced pork.  Only the basic dumplings are available and not very impressive.  Not sure if I'll be back.  Wish they would fix some of this.  Why is Charlotte so limited in good ethnic foods?!!!  Someone please come help us and put the PF Changs and Ruth's Chris' out of business!!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch just before 3. Everything we ordered was great but the BBQ pork and the duck are a must order. There's a lot of options on the carts. As soon as we sat down there were four different carts around our table. Choose wisely because your table and stomach will be full in no time! 

We had always wanted the Dim Sum experience so we went in with high hopes. This place didn't disappoint. The inside is very nice... in contrast to the outside that looks sketchy as can be."}
{"text":"This is a perfectly acceptable place to eat dim sum in Charlotte. Note, I said in Charlotte. We have very, very few options when it comes to this delicious dining category, so when you're craving taro dumplings or har dow dumplings your options are really limited. Dim Sum will satisfy your craving, but you won't walk out saying this is the best bunch of dumplings you've ever had.
If you are avoiding the specific dim sum menu, I  would steer away from the traditional American-Chinese dishes and ask the staff if they have any specials that aren't listed on the menu. Go with their recommendations and you'll probably have a great experience. I had a great dandelion dish there this past spring that wasn't advertised.
The service is really good. The staff is friendly, the kitchen is fast and it's a fun activity on a Saturday or Sunday morning."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for nearly 15 years the only reason I will give it 4 stars instead if 5 starts will be because of the cost. They have raised the prices of their specialty dishes and on the receipt it's written In Chinese so I don't know what I'm paying for, and knowing how they are, they are very quick to scam you u prices. With that said.

Dimsum here is FANTASTIC I love the food, I really do crave it but can never eat alone, everytime I go here I have to bring my family or atleast 3-4 friends to help out. Average ticket 250 bucks - 350 bucks but the amount of food that we get is insane! There are so many choices and so many good things I can't help but to order one or two of every dish that they offer! It's spectacular to eat family style meals like that bc your taste buds are gonna be so pleased with everything! Shu Mai, har dow, taro cake, clams with black bean sauce, sea bass fried with ginger soy sauce, Cantonese style lobster! All fantastic! This place I hold dear to me, if they was to closed down. I would be a broken foodie in pain"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant for Saturday/Sunday afternoon dim sum service.  I have never eaten here for a regular lunch or dinner - this review is specific to their dim sum service only.

Dim sum is a style of chinese cuisine served in bite-sized portions in small steamer dishes or on small plates.  Each dish usually comes with 3 - 4 pieces, ideal for sharing.  

Dim Sum is located on Central Avenue.  When you first pull in the parking lot, you may have second thoughts. The lot is full of pot holes and the building is a non-descript concrete square.  But, if you continue looking around, you'll notice the parking lot is probably full and there may be a line out the door - this place is a treasure!

On Saturday and Sunday afternoons, they serve traditional dim sum service.  Once you are seated, be prepared for your meal to begin quickly.  Servers with carts will come around and offer you what is available.  They will lift the lid of each dish to show you the food, if you don't know what it is - just ask!  

Each cart has a loose theme:  

The steamer cart - full of steamed dumplings and buns.  From this cart, I really like to get the pork siu mai (shoo my) - open-topped dumpling with ground pork and spices; pork steamed bun - bready bun filled with savory pork and sauce; and the leek and shrimp dumplings - shrimp and leek in a fully enclosed dumpling.  You may also like the sticky rice - this is a bundle of rice with pork and chicken bits cooked in and wrapped in a lotus leaf.   From here you can also get steamed chicken feet and pork spare ribs. 

The paste cart - this cart has shrimp and other meats that are wrapped in white, gelatinous noodles -- that look like paste.  I don't care for the texture of these items, so I wave this cart on.

The open-plate cart - this is my favorite!  On here you have items that are not steamed - they may be fried, pan seared or sauteed.  Hands-down favorite item is the stuffed eggplant with a fried shrimp mixture in it; I also like the leek dumpling and the taro root dumpling filled with pork and shrimp mixture.  The chinese brocolli, squid and spare ribs are also very good. 

This is a delightful way to spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon with family/friends.  Go, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just because its in Plaza-Midwood doesn't make it super elite uber trendy.  The place is ok. I've read many rave reviews about it and I just didnt see. Being that I am Chinese, from Taiwan, and from Phila I know good Chinese.  i was expecting the world and just got slow service and average food.  The interior does look like an urban Chinese restaurant though.  It feels blands and dirty..."}
{"text":"The dim sum is great. Really good, pork buns are awesome and same with pan fried pork dumplings."}
{"text":"I've ate dim sum many times in Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Toronto.  This place in Charlotte is by far the worst so far, even Cleveland is better.  Dim Sum Restaurant has a good variety of dishes and service was fast, but it was way too expensive for the kind of quality you get.  Most of the dishes taste mediocre, some too oily, and whats worse is its mushiness.  My next stop is Dragon Court..."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum in Charlotte. I love the no frills, strip mall appearance of the restaurant. Staff was very friendly, food came out quickly and was delicious! 

I have been here on Sundays when they push the carts around - I like that so you can \"see\" what you are ordering. I did Dim Sum last night and went off of the pictures on the menu (see picture). Price was OK, not too expensive or cheap. 

I will go back. More fun with a larger group of people so you can share!"}
{"text":"Yum!  It's not Hong Kong, but it's pretty darn good!  Great tasting dishes. Most definitely not low fat, just like the Chinese like it. Not super crowded on a Sunday even right at noon. (I'm new to Charlotte, so maybe the church crowd is bigger than I suspect and they may come a bit later.)  Lots of other Asian spots nearby, too."}
{"text":"\"American Chinese\", Authentic Chinese and Dim Sum!    

If you have never had Dim Sum the menu has photos so you can see what it looks like!  If you take a friend or two (or 5) it is really great because you can have tastes of many small dishes and if you do not care for one you don't have an entire plate of one flavor!  

They also have another menu that has what they call \"Authentic Chinese Cuisine\" for the MORE adventurous (more adventurous than Dim Sum) and \"Chinese\" (American as they say Chinese food for the uhhh less adventurous - Maybe I should not say that \"Dim Sum\" only sounds adventurous when you have not experienced it!  I have eaten selections from all three parts of the menu and here are the most recent dishes I have tasted!  Some Dim Sum is too plain for me.

Sesame Seed Balls are Delicious!

Wonton Soup! Very nice version!

Chicken Feet!  Boney yet Flavorful!  Glad I ate these though I was not making any Future Predictions!  Not planning any predictions, yet I was very VERY tempted to save the bones, though not for THAT!

Eggplant stuffed with Shrimp, better than 4 stars almost 5, with the House made Soy, ummmmh!  I have eaten these several times and all my Friends like these as one of the Favorites!

Shark Fin Dumpling...I'm NOT a fan, yet this one is very popular so do not go completely on my recommendation unless you see from other reviews that you like the flavors I do!

House Brewed Soy Sauce ! ! !  Ask for it ! ! ! 

Turnip Cake was OK.

Leak Dumpling, this one is pretty good 4 stars

Shrimp and Taro Root 

Szechuan Beef 4 stars

Ribs... I do NOT recommend unless you have an idea about Chinese Ribs! 1 star!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon for Dim Sum @ Dim Sum.  Weekends are always fun, because they have the carts circling the restaurant and you get to pick and choose what you want.  This was my second time here and the first time I would have rated it a 3/5 as the food was all 'Okay' and on the greasy side.  Hit the spot, but wasn't anything special.  This past Sunday was my first time after they re-opened and I was much impressed.

FOOD - 4/5 - Good selection of dim sum and everything we had was somewhere between good and great.  This isn't \"Best thing I've ever had\" type food, it's more for comfort food (al beit not traditional), variety, and nostalgia.  We had the sticky rice wrapped in banana leaf (I think), shu mai, chicken feet, pork buns, roast duck, those shrimp rolls (the white ones that come with sauce), and pineapple buns.  The sticky rice, shrimp rolls, and duck were stand outs.  Duck is on the fatty side, which I prefer, but certainly a preference.  Pork buns were quite disappointing.  As a staple and the most approachable for non-dim sum eats, it was dry with very little filling.    

Ambiance 4/5 (not that it's fancy, but it lives up to expectations) - The ambiance is exactly what I'd expect from a dim sum restaurant.  If I walk in to a dim sum place and I see Edison Bulbs and fancy tile work, I'm walking out.  This had everything I expect from dim sum:  drop ceilings, cheap metal framed chairs with vinyl cushions, and the push carts.  

Price - 3/5 - Not expensive by any stretch, but most Charlotte restaurants can't push the volume to have low prices.  We paid about $41 for two people and we were full.

Service - 4/5 - Carts were prompt, no problem paying or getting a take out box.  As long as I get my food, service isn't that important to me at Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever in the US. I even don't want to take the left over back. Overpriced and bad taste. Don't know how they can still open."}
{"text":"This place was great! I was highly impressed with the quality and variety of dim sum offered. The atmosphere was clean compared to your typical dim sum house. I feel Charlotte is very fortunate to have this gem. The location is kind of sketchy but everything within the walls of the establishment definitely make up for the area it is in. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group after church. Having been spoiled by good Dim Sum in Atlanta and New York, I was looking for something comparable here in CLT. Needless to say, the food here matched up favorably. We ordered a bunch of traditional Dim Sum fare including chicken feet, garlic pork ribs (very delicious!), this deep fried eggplant dish, and some other deep fried morsels with ground pork filling. We even ordered fried pork intestines. For those of you who are adventurous, the intestines are worth a try. The outside is crispy with a soft and chewy interior. Beware though, there is an aftertaste...it is pig intestines after all.

Overall, good experience. The food was flavorful, and the selection was great. I will definitely be back for brunch."}
{"text":"I knew the food would at least be alright when I walked in: my group and I were the only non-Asian table there. That is always a good sign for ethnic restaurants. The beginning of the dim sum came out quickly, but as the restaurant got more full, it started taking a while (tip: don't be greedy, hire more people). The food certainly tasted good, but was nothing Earth-shattering. I cannot see how some of these reviewers on Yelp come here and order anything but Dim Sum. Why come here when all you want is Americanized Chinese? Jeeze...

I would come back. Why three stars? The food is just not that memorable. It was tasty, but nothing new."}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum Restaurant within 3 state perimeter..New owner, good food & service.
Glad they are back in business, I could not find any local DS as good as this restaurant's DS.
I've had DS in many cities and this is as good..I recommend this restaurant.."}
{"text":"I would give this 0 star if I can. 

We went in Sunday to start our day with some dim sums, since they are the freshest on Sunday. And they actually roll the dim sum in carts.

When we walked in, I can see they are very busy. And there's 3 pplz in front of us. The front lady asked us how many, after I told her 2 she just walk off seating a guy in front of us. She came back and start seating these 2 pplz came after us. And then another lady came to ask how many we have. While I was telling her 2 pplz, the previous walked back and seat these 4 pplz just walk in.

So I asked her is there supposed to be a line. She was like no, they seat according to table. I was like I understand if the table fit 10, then u don't want to use it for 2 pplz. However if the table fit 4, I expected to be seat before other pplz that just walk in.

The dim sum is not the best, but it'll do for Charlotte. It's just that lady just ruined my whole mood to eat there, so we walk out and decided to try Krazy Fish down the road.

Probably will not go back for a long while!!!"}
{"text":"Since my wife introduced me to Dim Sum a few years ago, I've never been the same.  Case and point, was that we were traveling about 6 hours from VA to Chucktown, SC.  Earlier that week, I was on one of my internet hunts for Dim Sum in the Southeast.  I found this place and we HAD to stop.  It was little drive to get there, but worth it for us.  I don't know if we were hard up for Dim Sum, but this place was pretty good.  They have a ton of different things to choose from.  Char siu bao was good, some of the best around.  Definitely better than the frozen kind you get."}
{"text":"Wow do not judge a book by its cover! this place is the real deal, good food, good service, we had a full spread, Dim Sum and Peking Duck. Pork buns are super good, chicken spring rolls were tasty, duck was fantastic!  Our server was so nice and friendly, we were the last people in the Restaurant we closed it down, our first time and we felt right at home, cutting up with the staff we were all laughing and joking around. Good time Good Food Good Friends  it gets no better than this!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! Lived in Asia for the most part of my life. This is one of the closest thing for a full Dimsum Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Weekend mornings, legit Dim Sum!

Really enjoy the food here each time I come for Dim Sum on the weekends.

When there's loads of Chinese people each time I come here, you certainly get the feeling that you're enjoying some authentic food.

Be prepared to not know what everything is! Not that I've had food I didn't enjoy, and they are always willing to try and help you understand.

Can definitely keep this under budget, and with all the small size choices rolling around you won't leave dissapointed."}
{"text":"They have remodeled and reopened. The decor has been upgraded and is more simple and understated. The prices are fair and the dim sum is delicious as always. I can't wait to bring my wife back over here. It was her favorite.
At night you order off the menu and the dim sum is prepared to order. They even have a picture menu if your unsure of what to order."}
{"text":"Service was great, but almost every dish we got was under-seasoned. Also, the downfall of having carts is that everything ends up lukewarm or cold by the time it hits your table. The siu mai was good though!"}
{"text":"Pan dumplings were amazing . The rice and the chicken with broccoli were not good to me. Neither was the egg rolls. I wasn't expecting the kind of meal I received based on the reviews. Wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"Went on my way through town as this place was always a favorite. The decor is so much better. Staff was attentive. Food was as good as it was with the old management or owners or whatever. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This place is so bad. Half of what is on the menu is not even on it. The people don't even speak any english, so ordering is very difficult. The portions are small for what you pay for. The flavor is way off from what they call \"authentic\" Chinese food. Basically there is No flavors. Oh please do not order the lobster. It's not the one that you've look at. My lobster came out way to fast to be chopped up and cooked. Looked kinda old. So basically this place is a no go on food service or anything else. Oh and have of my order never came out and they still try to charge for it"}
{"text":"They have pretty good  variety of food loaded in total of 3 carts, and other dishes you could get it by odering. But I am not impressed by the quality. All the food tasted like MSG, some of them are either too dry or already cold. and they did not tasted like they were freshly made. I don't think the meal was worth the money at all, very disappointed.

Maybe I got too spoiled in San Francisco, but I think I'll rather give up dim sum if this is the only place you can get it in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very sweet, everyone is very accommodating. Everyone is full of smiles. The dim sum variety is huge and everything is perfectly seasoned. The reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because the food wasn't hot enough (I bit into some cold pieces) and the tea cups needed to be washed better!"}
{"text":"After a year of being in Charlotte, I finally gotten around to go to this place.. Hearing all the hype about this place.

Place - decent, reminds me of your typical Chinese restaurant that just needs a bit more of a reno (that is just me being picky).  The restaurant was easy to find, with their red and yellow sign. Parking may be tough if it is busy, since there are limited spots in the front.  A friend suggested to come early Sat at 11am, to get a table before it quickly fills up.

Food - not great, but good. I guess it is as good as it will get in Charlotte. I do miss Houston, TX and NYC's dim sum food.

   . I found the 'ha gao' (shrimp dumpling in clear flour) to be mushy =\
   . Their steamed rice with pork, sausage, and mushroom wrapped in banana leaf - was delicious and fulfilling
   . Egg custard is good, happy with the taste.
   . Chrysanthemum tea is good to help with digestion when you are full.
   . My husband who avoids eating chicken feet, was pushed to try it from a friend of ours - he actually liked it. Said the flavor was better than others that he have tried before.

Service - good enough."}
{"text":"Been a fan of this experience for many years. Lucky to be back in charlotte and feast again. My dinner companion ate the chicken feet. I opted for dumplings and a few unidentified fried delicies. Terrific food and attentive,  knowledgeable server. Yeah, happy guys."}
{"text":"Pricy place for just a mediocre dim sum place. There were 3 of us, and I have never eaten $80 worth of dim sum in any other places, not even in NY. Maybe there are not a lot of dim sum places around in this location so they can price whatever they want.  I would not go there again."}
{"text":"Food: Lots of dim sum favorites like cheung fan, lo mai gai, har gau, siu mai.

Decor: Low ceiling, uneven flooring, cluttered feel.

Service: Lots of staff to help make the right choices, score the right dishes, and clean up after.  Friendly and eager to help.

Location: Close enough to uptown for lunch. Just a quick drive."}
{"text":"Waiteress and all where nice. The food was cold and overpriced. We didn't even order that much food. Won't be going back there again."}
{"text":"Even did not fish the food, they bring the check to pay. And ask you when are you going to leave. Shit man I am not even finish. Do not kick me out.
I am your customer. Bad service."}
{"text":"This place is over priced and do not trust the prices on yelp because they don't match up with what they actually charge you when you pick up your food. Food doesn't have much flavor and the place from the outside look kinda sketchy."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a better Chinese restaurant in Charlotte.  I actually bought my house in the neighborhood because we kept passing the Dim Sum place and I asked the realtor \"hey, what's up that street in front of the Dim Sum\" and there was my house, For Sale By Owner, I'd never have found it if it weren't for Dim Sum.  And when I moved in and my refrigerator didn't get delivered for 10 days, they pretty much fed me daily.  I was hooked.  Five years later, I still go there all the time, and every friend or family member who comes to town gets taken there.  I've never had anything that wasn't good.  Dim Sum on Saturday and Sunday mornings, with the little carts going full steam, is of course the big draw, but you can order most of the little dim sum treats any time you come in there.  Every now and then the waitresses will tell me that I should try some special dish.  I got a lamb hotpot that way that I've never seen on the menu since."}
{"text":"Being half Chinese and coming from Los Angeles I was looking for Dim Sum a restaurant in Charlotte. I found it and literally the restaurant's name  is exactly what it serves along with other authentic Chinese dishes. I brought my boyfriend here who never had dim sum before, he took a few bite and decided he loves this place. They recently did some renovations on the inside and it looks great. The ladies who work there are really nice and speaks English really well. Enjoy your dining experience, I know I did! :)"}
{"text":"Very very very very slow. We've been waiting for 40 mins for our dim sum when there even ain't so much people. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We ordered 6 small dishes. Chicken feet and shrimp dumpling are great! The pork bun is good too. They don't serve dessert like tart on weekdays. Overall good."}
{"text":"So I use to eat here quite frequently but stopped since my palete has since expanded. So we went here today for a quickly. And we ordered the shiu mai which was a shrimp dumpling. Which is typically one of their best dishes. Let me tell you something, it sucked.... badly. Because you could tell it was not fresh. It looked like something they had previous steamed and it was left over that was resteemed. Second, the rest of their dumpling was just aokay. I order the fried crispy rice noodle crepe. And it eventually never made it out. The manager apologized profusely, which was very kind of her. But nonetheless it doesn't makeup for less than average dim sum. The weird thing is on the weekends, I feel like it tastes better because it is more fresh. And another pet peeve of mine is when the food comes out at different times. They literally brought the dish out one by one, with a freaking 5 minute interval in between."}
{"text":"We ordered from the menu and dim sum. The dim sum prices were fair but the dishes we ordered from the menu were overly priced and the portions were small. Service was slow but they knew they were going to add gratuity to our bill. Overall, the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited on a Tuesday afternoon for some Dim Sum. Finally found what I was looking for, some TRUE chinese food (although I was disappointed to see orange chicken on the menu... what a shame). We tried the lotus cakes, steamed pork buns, chicken feet, tripe, shrimp rice noodle crepe, and shui mai. The lotus cakes were delicious as were the steamed pork buns, shrimp rice noodle crepe, and shui mai. The black bean sauce on the chicken feet was good, but I personally think chicken feet are too much of a hassle to eat. This is the first time I have ever had tripe and I will say I am not a fan! But, that is nothing against the way Dim Sum makes it. Overall I will return to satisfy my urge for some chinese food."}
{"text":"We are from the NY area with much experience at many great dim sum restaurants.  This Charlotte dim sum restaurant is mostly very good although its selection is a bit limited as compared to the NY restaurants. The Chicken Feet is tender and its black bean sauce is very tasty. The Har Gow is good although the skin should be a bit thinner and more translucent. The Siew Mai, Steamed Spare Ribs, and Stuffed Eggplant are on par with those at NY. Missing from their selections are favorites such as Stuffed Tofu Skin, Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaves, and Tripe. We arrived at the restaurant at 1:20 with a party of 6 and got a table within 10 minutes so this was a far shorter wait than  at the NY restaurants. Service was efficient without any frills just like at any Chinese restaurants. The rest rooms are adequate but nothing to write home about. Overall, I had a great culinary experience and look forward to going back to this restaurant the next time I am in Charlotte. ."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT THERE.  The very last time I ate there was about 4yrs ago.  My wife and I took my parents to this place before they moved back to California.  The food was oily and there was some multi-legged insect frozen in the ice in the cup of water on our table.  GROSS!!!  I don't even know how this place stays open."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to go on the weekends when I lived in Plaza Midwood area.  When I moved to another city and we came back to visit, this was my go-to place.  I don't know why I never wrote a review because I really like the dim sum here.  And this place has definitely undergone some changes since we lived here before - an updated interior that looks cleaner and new owners, apparently.  

Unless something has changed, you can order dim sum from the menu on weekdays, but on the weekends they have the carts.  This is my favorite because you can see what they're offering and make a decision that way.  They have some pretty dumplings (I like their shrimp ones in particular) and meat dishes, but two things in particular are my go-to dishes.  Their sticky rice is hands down my favorite rice dish ever.  I like that it's a little sweet, has little bits of flavorful meat in the middle, and has a terrific flavor to it from the lotus leaf it's wrapped in.  The sesame bun is my other favorite.  The texture is light and the filling is a little sweet and nutty from the sesame.  We like to try interesting things, which are sometimes a miss for us, but overall most of their dishes we have tried are good.  The only problem is that it is so easy to find yourself with too many dishes and end up with a large bill if you don't watch it.  

When we came on around noon on a Saturday, the carts started coming quickly and the food on them was plenty warm and fresh.  It wasn't too busy so the service was pretty good.  Everyone was friendly and we had a good experience.  I'm not sure how good the service is when they get busy, as I generally come when I know it's less busy.

I really like Dim Sum, particularly when they have the cart out on the weekend."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte with a few friends and we decided to come here for dim sum! The restaurant  was recently renovated, so it's very spacious and clean. 

Since we went on a weekday, they didn't have dim sum carts going around. However, I was happy to see that their menu for dim sum had pictures! Since I don't eat dim sum too often, I never really know what to order so having pictures helped us a lot. 

Between the three of us, we ordered 2 dishes (1 vegetable + 1 noodle entree) and 9 dim sums ($3.50 each). We had leftovers from the dishes because the dumplings we ordered filled us up. I definitely recommend their beef chow fun. 

Service was decent and food came out within a reasonable time. I will be back!"}
{"text":"For Charlotte, it's the best dim sum restaurant in town. The food is fresh, very tasty, and it's a relatively authentic experience. If we're comparing to dim sum restaurants in other cities, it would only get 3 stars. The reason is because the food does not come on carts with heating elements. Truly authentic dim sum restaurants actually cook/steam the foods directly on the carts. So it mostly translates to the temperature of the food and crispiness of the fried items. But if you're in Charlotte and want some dim sum, this is as good as it gets and it's still a very good experience, just don't expect it to be as good as you might find elsewhere in the country."}
{"text":"Still one of the best dim sum place in my view. I've had plenty of dim sum in other cities before and most were alright. The servers here by far are always nicer than most place.  It's not stellar service but trust me, most Asian restaurants have horrible service and takes forever to bring small requests such as hot chili oil or just a water! Be prepared to come early on Sunday morning if you don't want to wait for a table since that's when they are busiest. They do serve dim sum during the weekdays but it's as ordered."}
{"text":"Wanted to find out good Dim Sum place as I moved in Charlotte recently. Turned out just fine, I expected more from a 3 and a half star review restaurant."}
{"text":"I like Dim Sum Chinese. 

It can definitely use a makeover. Not necessarily the cleanest, nicest digs. And the day that we went, we got there soon after it opened...thus, we were the only ones in attendance and thus, the energy was a little low in there. 

So I cannot accurately describe the service, other than to say that they were very attentive to us :) But I hear that it gets super busy on the weekends and that it's a completely different vibe in there. 

But ultimately you want to know about the food right? 

The food was pretty good. To be honest, we really enjoyed the various dishes that we tried. The dumplings seem to come to mind as I write this. Pork and shrimp dumplings were excellent.

The prices are very reasonable. If you give it a shot, I think you'll like it!"}
{"text":"We moved to Charlotte a few months ago and I am so happy to have found this dim sum place. Although there's not many to select from in Charlotte, this restaurant is pretty good and the staff is very nice. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My food was undercooked! The pork/shrimp shui mai we ordered was not fully cooked at all. We told our waiter and she bought it back to the kitchen to ask them, then she came back and apologized and asked if we would like to replace it or take it off the check. Wth! ?. Take it off please cus that was disgusting. . We ordered at least 8 dishes. And also I didn't feel like my beef crepes was fully cooked. (One of my favs!) after knowing the shui mai was undercooked I just didn't feel safe eating the other items. ALSO...! They didn't have the pecking duck! (BBQ roasted duck). Such a disappointment dim sum visit. This place used to be my fav spot for dim sum until the recent new management."}
{"text":"I've been in Charlotte for almost a month now, and have only experienced one great disappointment: that there are only two dim sum restaurants in the entirety, AND that they're both half an hour away from me. Why, Dim Sum? Why?

Now it seems besides the Dragon Court (which doesn't seem to be wowing people either), the Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant is all I have left. Le sigh. 

Alright, lament aside and review on, this place did not dress to impress. Outside looked pretty sketch, and upon walking in there, the cook and what looked like the manager were sitting down watching tv. They seemed to be able to afford the down time because there wasn't a soul in the house. I waited awkwardly by the counter, then said, \"Excuse me,\" three times to no avail. Then suddenly, for some reason, the chef looked up, barked something and a waitress came out with my order.

First things first: if you are a full-time Dim Sum restaurant, you need to have some staples that come with availability. All sweet items are done ONLY on weekends. This includes the custard tarts, coconut rolls, fried pineapple rolls, ANYTHING that resembles a dessert, and one of the biggest staples of dim sum and one of my personal favorites, zha leung cheung fun, also known as Chinese fried dough wrapped in rice noodle. I know how this may sound, but for those of you who have experienced a good zha leung cheung fun, you know what I'm talkin'bout. 

That taken off my order, I almost decided to wait for the weekend, BUT I was only 15 out of the thirty minutes away in a car with no air conditioning - I may as well tough the damn thing out. Also up on the list: pork and shrimp dumplings, fried shrimp balls, and chicken feet. 

This is my usual dim sum test. Something I like and is easy (dumplings), something I hadn't tried before (shrimp balls), and... the feet. You can always tell how good a dim sum place is going to be by their chicken feet. In this case, the chicken feet were cooked moderately well, but had no seasoning whatsoever and what little sauce there was was very bland. The meat in the dumplings tasted good, but had an odd texture of not ground, but pureed. It took me a couple to get used to it. The shrimp balls were huge, and delicious. However, the outside was soggy instead of the crunchy I was hoping for. 

All in all, hoping for a better dim sum experience. Now all I can do is place my hope in the Dragon Court. Wish me luck."}
{"text":"I think I made a terrible mistake and ordered Americanized -Chinese food from a Dim Sum Restaurant.  

We ordered two extra-crispy General Tso's Chicken with added rice (one white, one fried) and an egg roll. They do not serve combos here so our two entrees came to about $23. There was a lot of food - but it was a little pricier than some of the other fast food Chinese take-out places. I don't mind paying extra if it's tasty- and it really wasn't that much more in terms of price. 

It was hands down the worst Chinese I have ever tasted. The rice had a rancid flavor - it smelled and tasted quite bad so my husband graciously offered his white rice to me. The base of fried rice is white rice so I doubt it was the rice itself but whatever they put in it was not appetizing. The chicken was soggy, sugary-sweet (tasted like a very spicey sweet and sour sauce, it was even bright red in color) ...it didn't taste like any General Tso's I have tasted before. I barely ate my dinner and because it was take-out I wasn't able to give management a chance to fix it unfortunately. 

There were a couple of highlights ...the staff went the extra step to attempt to keep the crispy texture and did not sauce the chicken until we picked up our dinners, which was very thoughtful of her. They also have a really delicious homemade eggroll. It was oily but you know what it had actual meat and veggies inside of it and that made me happy. 

Overall I just can't bring myself to come back for take-out, but I was told the Dim Sum on Sundays is delicious so I may give that a shot in six months once I forget about that rice that will haunt my dreams."}
{"text":"This may be partly because we weren't sure which dishes we needed to try, but overall we weren't overly satisfied with the food. We were looking forward to trying a Dim Sum place in Charlotte, Some of the dim sum had good flavor too it but most seemed to starchy and had very little flavor. After one visit I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Yay, Dim Sum is open again! We were so happy to see this place reopened and most of the faces are very familiar. It was a happy little reunion at the restaurant this morning. 
For starters, this place has a completely new look. I wish I had taken pictures of the interiors. It looks very nice and clean. 
We went in for dim sum during brunch. Last weekend was their first weekend open and the wait was over an hour so we left and came back early today. We were promptly seated. The dim sum carts were rolling in very frequently and they had all of the good stuff - har dow, leek dumpling, shrimp balls, chicken feet, shrimp crepe, siu mai, Chinese broccoli etc. We got one of each (and two of the leek dumplings because they are SO good) and were happy to know the taste hadn't changed at all. The chili oil was also the good ol' kind that's made in-house and has been consistently amazing over the years. We also ordered the house special ho fun because that was our other favorite thing to order here, but that tasted different. Firstly it didn't have the beef-pork-chicken, but instead had shrimp and scallops. Also, it used to be a brown sauce with bok choy in it, but today's was a white sauce with asparagus. Oh well, it was still really good. 
I am just happy that this place reopened. If you haven't been here yet, consider this your second chance and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Such great dim sum and Chinese food! Everything we had was amazing ( esp the Peking dumplings! ). Highly highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, always been a fan of the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf. The service and quality have always been at or above our expectations, and we've had dim sum in larger cities across the US for many years.  We ate here again today for brunch and were inspired to write a review after another great experience."}
{"text":"Worst ever! The duck was all fat, bones and grease. No meat! Dumplings were cold. I paid my check and left in less then 15 minutes. I did register my complaint with the wait staff & management, neither could care less!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for a private party (read: custom-ordered dinner) and the food was great. We're still in Charlotte, keep in mind, and I've yet to find anything that blows my mind enough I can brag to my friends back home In Seattle about. I'd settle for a place I wouldn't be hideously embarrassed to bring my dad the retired Master Chef to eat at when he comes to visit. But, at least there is acceptable, even sort of good, Chinese food in Charlotte. Service is good, but the restaurant tables are a little awkwardly situated that you might have to do some waving to get someone's attention. 

I came back on New Year's Day for actual dim sum and I was satisfied. The food seems fresh and aside from a little bit greasy (it's restaurant food, after all) and a hint of MSG, it's totally fine by me. The chicken feet were good, the bbq pork buns were fresh and fluffy, pretty much everything was as it should be. The turnip (radish?) cakes were especially tasty and radishy. I wonder if they make it in-house. Other places have it so mushed up you can't barely tell from the texture it was a grated root vegetable.

I would, however, stay away from the rice steam cooked in the leaves. I've never seen anyone serve it this way. Instead of 2 or 3 small ones steamed in a little container, they have one absurdly large one (making it hard to share). They cut a flap of leaf open on the top and they jam a spoon into it for you to scoop it out. It can't work this way! The way the leaf-food works is that when it's piping hot, the rice slides off of the leaf easily when it's opened up. If you let the rice cool down, like, say, by opening a flap in the leaf, then it doesn't come off the leaf. You end up sitting there trying to scrape at the leaf, yielding you some bitter leaf bits stuck to your precious tasty sticky rice. 

Bonus points to this place for having hot chrysanthemum tea. They also have jasmine, and pu-er, which are pretty standard to dim sum. I was pleased for a different kind of tea, which happens to be one of my favorites!

I think Dim Sum is worthy of carrying the name. At least for now. I still hope for more authentic and good Chinese in Charlotte. *fingers and chopsticks crossed*"}
{"text":"Dim Sum here is terrible.  Charlotte does not have enough competition for Dim Sum.  I used to live in Atlanta.  I enjoyed the dim sum houses there.  I grade Dim Houses with a curve in Charlotte.  I am not expecting them to be as good as Atlanta.  Even with a curve, the dim sum is terrible.   

  I went on a weekend.  Many of the dumplings were obviously frozen and not fresh.  Dim Sum was very heavy as well.  I only ordered steam items and a few pan fried items.  However, I had a real full stomach.  I was not feeling good at all.  I did not even eat much.  The dim sum was flavorless and greasy.   If you live in Charlotte, go to China Delight in Atlanta to get good dim sum."}
{"text":"Love the new place! It was closed down then reopened under new management and I love the changes! 
When you first enter, the old fish tank filled with live seafood in murky waters is now gone In its place is brand new floors and an upgraded seating area. Enter the restaurant and you'll see more of the new floors along with new tables, new carpet, and a new ceiling with new light fixtures. The lighting is dimmer than before but not a drastic difference. The upgraded clean look is exactly what the former hole in the wall needed. 

The service also improved. I'm used to seeing stoic faces who may or may not give an edge of attitude when you ask for more than one condiment. Our waitress today was friendly, welcoming and seemed to actually enjoy her job. How refreshing! 

Now onto the food! I came with my mother for a Monday lunch date. There were 4 other tables occupied- not very busy but we came around 2 pm which is probably after the lunch rush. 

The menu has even changed a bit - it's no longer a 32 page menu. Instead, they kept the most popular dishes and discarded the others. I was sad that one of the menu items discarded was my favorite soup -  dried scallop and crab meat. I must've made a sad face at the waitress because she was immediately apologetic and suggested I try the seafood soup instead. Since my mom and I weren't sure if we'd like It or not, I only ordered one for myself. Boy, was it a surprise. It was DEEEEERICIOUS! So good that I had to order another one because Moms called dibs. And you don't mess with Mom when she's hangry. 

We also ordered dim sum - everything was fresh and delicious, not old tasting. You can tell when they reheat leftovers and that was not the case here. Stuffed eggplant was the best I've ever had, cooked perfectly; stuffed tofu was extremely crispy on the outside with a tender moist shrimp filling. The shrimp and scallop balls were fried to perfection with the right balance of seasoning. My all time favorite is the turnip cake. It was seared on the outside with a slight crunch but not so long that you lose the turnip texture. And they had plenty of Chinese sausage bits throughout. I've been to places where the turnip cake is mostly dough and this was so not that! My only gripe is that the tripe and pork ribs were a little tough. If It were cooked another half hour, It would've been perfect too. 

Mom and I were both fully satisfied with our meal. So much that she's already planning our next Dim Sum date. I hope they keep up with the quality and customer service. If so, I can see them actually start to change Charlotte's Dim Sum scene. One can hope!"}
{"text":"Best dim sum in Charlotte. Nowhere else is comparable. Food is pretty good and fresh. Make sure to get there early on weekends BC there is always a line"}
{"text":"I know this place is considered great by most, but we had a really really gross experience there.   So let me just say that the rating is more based on the experience then the actual quality of the food (I don't feel confident to judge the food since it was my first dim sum experience).  The menu and tables smelled strongly of dirty dish rags, and I think it was the patrons next to us that smelled like human excrement (not Dim Sum's fault, I know, but it makes it very difficult to maintain an appetite).  We ordered a variety of appetizers with the main courses to follow...  The appetizers were really mushy, and the combination of mushy food and the mix of dirty smells made both our stomachs upset, so we got the main courses boxed - we couldn't get out  of there fast enough.  I had a bite of the main courses at home but I threw out the food right after the first bite because I couldn't stop thinking about what just happened.  We will probably never return. The experience gets a two instead of a one because the waitress was very very nice."}
{"text":"On Sunday's for brunch they walk around with carts of food and you get to pick what you what.  It was really cool and something that I have never experienced before.  We went with our friends that have gone there before so they knew what to pick.  They told me that it was the most authentic Chinese food they've had in Charlotte.  Me personally didn't like most of the items we tried.  Some were just too sweet or just too odd tasting for me.  I liked some things but they weren't amazing to me.  I probably would go back though just because of how cool it was with their dim sum.  I definitely recommend experiencing a dim sum at some point!"}
{"text":"Visited there with my family on a random monday around 12pm under the new management, the place is empty.

$2 tea charge per head is more expensive than some of the finest restaurants on the coast.

I understand that they are the only dim sum restaurant in charlotte and it is very hard to find qualified restaurant workers locally.  But it doesnt mean us, as the consumers, should be punished by the bad quality food with expensive price tag.

We had 8 different dim sum for the first round, and it is impossible for us to finish the food and able to order a second round.

At $4.5 a tray, i expect a little more heart on their dishes.  A good $50 wasted and we wont be back."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my sisters birthday and we ordered about 4 ppls serving of food so we tried a variety. It was good. The duck noodle soup was good and the domain was average. I have nothing bad to say about this place. When I wen the service was good too."}
{"text":"This is on,y the second time that I have had dim sum in my life ever so it's had for me to gauge the authenticity.  I can say that we were served warm plates of tasty stuff.

Came here hungry with a coupla buddies of mine and left completely comatosed.  It's been a week or so since I went so I dont' have a good recollection.

Sorry.  Too bad--Yelp! is more for me anyways :/

dmo out"}
{"text":"I've dined here several times and the dimsum is ok. It's definitely hit or miss here. Sometimes the food is nice and hot and other times the food is ice cold. This place isn't the best dimsum I've had but not the worse I've I've had either. Considering i don't have much dimsum options in CLT this place will have to suffice. I really wish CLT offered better dimsum options like NYC or Boston does."}
{"text":"This is the best Dim Sum restaurant in Charlotte, even though there are only 2 in Charlotte. This place is better. Get there by 1130AM if you don't want to wait in line. They push the dim sum carts around and you get your typical dim sum variety. Shu Mai, Shrimp balls, tripe, chicken feet, ribs, duck, and etc... Pricing is pretty typical $3.50 for small plate to $6.50 for a larger plate. You can also request a menu and order from that. 

For tripe lovers out there this place no longer use real tripe for their tripe dish. Now they're using a different intestinal lining which is easier to cook, but doesn't taste as good as the normal tripe that we typically know and love."}
{"text":"Good service. Decent food for small towns. Overall experience was okay. However lobster ginger scallion for $62 was a bit pricey for this place. I would recommend if you haven't tried them dim sum to give it a go."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars I would. 
It is dirty and the food is gross. My girlfriend and I didn't eat anything. We just left.  I got the Singapore Mie fun. The shrimp were not cooked, and the noodles where gross.
Service was just as bad. No one came to our table for 5-10 minutes.."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fantastic food. Don't let the outside fool you - this place is great!"}
{"text":"Cockroaches! BEWARE. 

I do understand that it's pretty damn hard to have a restaurant free of cockroaches, one or two I can forgive. But this place is infested, and you'll find a lot of roaches in the dining area! I noticed at least 3 different cockroaches crawling up my chair. For that reason alone, I'm giving it a 1-star review."}
{"text":"Alright so this doesn't actually deserve 4/5 stars but let's be real, there aren't many dim sum options around Charlotte and compared to the other places, I think this one is the best. 

If you have had dim sum in NY or Cali, please don't compare it to dim sum here because it's not on the same level; however, it's not bad! They have your regular dim sum options that are reasonably priced. Their tea is pretty pricey though and we were charged about $6 for chrysanthemum tea. 

All in all, come try this place out! Service is authentic- lol, but it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"As I stepped off the plane  in Charlotte I had one thought on my mind... dumplings. I had recently attended a conference in Seattle (Podcon) and tried soup dumplings for the first time. My life was forever changed. But I was saddened to discover the Din Tai Fung only had 4 locations in the entire United States. None of those locations were on the east coast. 

So it is with this pioneer spirit in mind that my wife and I set out to explore our local cuisine for some sort of substitute. I put \"dumplings\" into the Yelp! app and it returned with a few results. Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant was one of the first on the list. We went about 2 pm on a weekday and it was basically empty.

They have a menu with pictures of the various appetizer dishes that you check off and they bring them to you. We tried as much as we could fit into our stomachs before getting way too full. We had to bring the rest home. We ordered so much food and it still came to less than $50 for both of us.

A few days later our adventurous spirit returned and we found ourselves in Dim Sum once again. This time it was a Sunday afternoon and the experience was completely different. 

The place was packed. Everyone was talking in languages we didn't understand with our ignorant American minds. When we sat down this time they brought around carts full of delicious foods already prepared. And we just picked which items we wanted off the cart and they put it right on the table. It was like a dim sum buffet that comes around to your table. 

We tried all sorts of things we'd never had before. Even Chicken Feet. What do chicken feet taste like? Chicken. The wait staff was attentive and made sure we knew what we were ordering if we had any questions. This place felt so authentic to the Asian community that I felt like a tourist in my own city. Thank you Dim Sum staff for welcoming us into your home.

I love this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Did not have the dim sum but I had the shrimp lo mein at lunch. Pretty good lo mein but not the best I've ever had. Not even top 5. About 30 minutes after eating I got a stomach ache and had to \"pucker up\" until work was over. In my opinion this place is over priced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I was saddened and disappointed with this place, although wanted to try it for some time as it's the only dim sum around.  

I went on Christmas Day and it was busy, but not too bad. We were seated right away and greeted to put our order in.  I ordered crab rangoon, pork bun, steamed dumplings and egg drop soup.  Sadly, I only liked the pork bun.

The rangoon was terribly rich.  Greasy, creamy and rich. I could only have one, and with that, felt ill.  The dumplings were just ok.  The came with sauce on top, nothing to dip...and a HUGE wad of meat inside...might be good for someone, ugh...but not me.  The egg drop soup had an odd flavor and I only ate one bite.  The pork bun was good.  Tasty meat inside, just the right amount and perfect bun.

The restroom was hideously dirty.  I mean disgusting!  Avoid it at all costs.  The overall restaurant was not bad...it looked clean and pretty organized.  

The service was good.  The prices were entirely ridiculous for what you got. I spent over $30 on appetizers that is disliked.  Will probably not come back, but you live and you learn."}
{"text":"Seated right away. Within one minute a cart was at our table. They described each dish to us and served us with a smile. Carts continued to come quickly - we were never left wanting for food. Lots of options to choose from. Our favorites were: sesame balls, fried pork bun, steamed BBQ bun, steamed shrimp dumplings, Chinese broccoli, and the pork and shrimp dumpling. We saw that other tables were also able to order things like duck and lo mien but we came just for the dim sum. Great service. Place was completely packed with a full waiting room. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Decent vegetarian options, somewhat interesting flavors, but for the most part, feels like there's something missing.  

Ma Po Tofu was a souped-up (no pun intended) version of whatever-in black bean sauce. Hot and Sour soup was somewhat impressive, black vinegar flavor shining through, and it wasn't a problem to keep the pork out (which means they're not making it at 10am and letting it sit for umpteen hours). Greens (bok choy, choy sum, etc) are delicious here. Flecks of browned garlic abounding, yay! 

But if you're looking for veggie-friendly Dim Sum, you'll need to make special plans. When I inquired, I was told it wouldn't be a problem with a week's notice and a large-ish guest list.  

Prices are a bit high, but the staff are sweet and the veg selection good enough to keep me interested."}
{"text":"Food is not stellar the atmosphere is kind of gloomy like eating in a basement. I haven't found another place in Charlotte that can beat this though, sad to say! The staff is decent, the ladies up front are really nice! It's a decent place if you are really desperate for some dim sum. They have a good selection in their menu too."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday evening in Plaza Midwood and I found myself hungry with a taste for Asian cuisine. I turned to Yelp to find the highest rated spot and Dim Sum seemed to be the best option. I called my order in and figured the food would be great based off the very thick accent on the other side of the phone. My meal consisted of basic Chinese-American fare which I figured would be a safe bet for takeout. I got back to the friend's apartment I was visiting to find that there were no utensils in the bag with our food (none were on display at the Dim Sum restaurant counter either.) The friend I was visiting had just moved in that day and had no accessible utensils, causing me to leave AGAIN to run to the nearest store and pickup forks. When I finally got to eat my dinner, I was severely disappointed. The sesame chicken was okay- the flavor was adequate but the meat tasted cheap and the sauce appeared to be cut with water. The thin, diluted sauce pooled at the bottom of the bowl making the undersides of the chicken soggy. I tried to ignore the fact that the sauce had been contaminated since, after all, it appeared to just be water.

Then I tried the fried rice. My biggest regret in life is that I swallowed the bite off my fork rather than spit it back out. Knowing that the rice was being processed by my body severely grossed me out for the rest of the night. I couldn't decide what would be worse- digesting the rice or the taste of throwing it back up.

Enough about how the rice made me feel and more about the reasoning why: It tasted like it had been soaked in a marinade of water and half decayed cigarette butts. There were no vegetables mixed with the rice and the texture itself seemed as if it had been through a continuous cycle of sitting out, getting microwaved and then set back out again. over and over. 

When I went to throw out the entire container after my first bite, my friend protested and offered that he would eat whatever I did not wish to finish. Some background on this particular friend of mine: He will literally eat anything. My friend took a forkful of the rice and had the same immediate repulsion that I myself had endured. His exclamations reasserted my claim of the cigarette taste that clung to the underside of the throat in a heavy aftertaste that entices one to get sick out of some evolutionary reflex.

Maybe the actual Dim Sum cuisine is fine if dining in. Maybe the kitchen doubles as a smoking lounge. Whatever it may be, I regret the overpriced $20 I spent to not be able to actually eat my dinner."}
{"text":"Having been back here for years !!
Nice service and the food was very good 
We ordered steam bun fried sesame balls chix broccoli and dumplings and few other dimsum"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it. Although, they sell dim sum a la cart all day, Go on Saturday/ Sunday around brunch for the true dim sum experience with the carts."}
{"text":"Food was great! Ended up having a lot of food to take home. The carts going around make you just want to grab and grab food. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because when we went to go pay, the lady at the register looked at us, with no smile or any type of happiness and said \"type ISNT included\""}
{"text":"The dim sum is good.  Make sure to ask if fresh when addressing the fried cart.  Feel free to lift the lids of the plates on the carts and try the options the waiters don't offer.  Tasty items like slow braised chicken feet are usually never offered to Americans.  try everything at least once.  Worse case you spit it out!  I don't give 5 stars because the menu is static and rarely changes. Can't convince them to put a noodle option.  When they do. I'll give up another star."}
{"text":"MUST READ!!! The restuarant is under new ownership!!!! New menu in place. They still serve some dimsum but the other side of the menu is now completely fast food chinese dishes. I was highly disappointed as I don't just eat dimsum alone, I eat it with other favorite authentiic chinese dishes that are no longer available. Not that I don't recommend it but please be aware of this before you walk in."}
{"text":"Growing up, I used to go here every Sunday, however stopped for 5 years and I finally made back couple of weeks ago. So, what's my thought?

I'm truly disappointed. Their dim sum wasn't fresh anymore. How would I know? 1. I inherited my parents' (my father used to be a chef) canine-like nose and taste, so I definitely know when something isn't fresh. 2. I've been to NYC and Atlanta, so if you want fresh dim sum then you have to try those places first and then tell me if Dim Sum is still good or not. 

I'm not trying to be mean, but this place isn't authentic anymore. I think due to the change in clientele that this place americanized their dim sum. 

I'm definitely will not be plan on going back for any reason. I think I'll stick with my random trips to Atlanta and get dim sum there."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars because it is a legit dim sum restaurant in Charlotte. It's legit because it has chicken feet in black bean sauce and because they roll out the dim sum on carts, it can be very busy on Sunday afternoon but it slows down around 1:30. They have some excellent dumplings as well as park spareribs, shrimp stuffed eggplant, lotus rice, etc. No atmosphere. It's a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Authentic Dim Sum in Charlotte.  Definitely not the best neighborhood, nor is the restaurant the cleanest place in the city, but where else can you find an authentic Dim Sum experience in the Queen city?

Recently went through a renovation (summer '14) and naturally jacked the prices up on their food.  You'll be looking at a lunch bill around $10 if you want to sample a few Dim Sum offerings and are drinking flat water.  Unfortunately, because of this, the value is rather marginal on their offering - it was a mistake in my book.

That said, however, the food itself is tasty and the experience of Dim Sum is unlike your traditional run-of-the-mill offerings around Charlotte, so it's worth a shot.  I'd definitely recommend the leak dumplings, the sticky pork buns, and plenty of that hot/oil/sauce they keep on the table - I eat that stuff straight."}
{"text":"Excellent Dim Sum favorites.  We heard of this place from friends and decided to drive the 2+ hours from our mountain home in Brevard, NC for a taste.  We came on a Wednesday so the traditional carts were not present(carts are weekends only).  But it didn't matter the A La Carte ordering was quick and all the dishes came direct from steamers.  The dim sum, especially the spicy chicken feet, was well worth the drive.  Additionally the service superior.  We will definitely come more often."}
{"text":"Since they don't have much competition in the Dim Sum category, I thought they could get away with crappy food but actually this place is pretty decent.

The menu items are standard across all dim sum places - I usually base my judgement of dim sum places on their chicken feet, spare ribs, haw gow, and siu mai. All these items were about right. One particular item of note is the fried taro/shrimp patty. The shrimp paste patty is battered with shredded taro and fried. Crispy, shrimpy and tasty. 

One thing that I wouldn't order again is the roast pork - barely any flavor and not roasted enough.

The dearth of decent Chinese food in Charlotte has left my standards pretty low. It's pricer than what dim sum should normally be, but again, they can get away with that and it's solid food so I'm willing to pay it."}
{"text":"The menu and prices posted in other reviews are wrong! Selections of dim sum are not many, not as many as shown on the wrong menu in other review. Prices are higher than other dim sum restaurant at the same level."}
{"text":"We went last 7-24-16, GREAT food, only thing is the wait, a table for 2 took 20 minutes, my wife was almost ready to leave, it wasn't busy, plenty of tables. Price is fair."}
{"text":"Really pretty decent for CLT. Large selections and conveniently located on Central. The beef balls, shrimp and pork dim sum are all very delicious. I especially order congee with salt soaked duck eggs to go as I really enjoy them. The tea is hot, while not the best, is a good compliment to the dim sum. Yang chow fried rice and fried three precious are meeting with my expectations! The traffic is wild over the weekend and slow during the week except for dinner.  Always having plenty of parking around is a plus to the experience! :) will return again soon."}
{"text":"Having lived in Worcester, Massachusetts (that's Woo-ster, not Wor-ches-ter) for nearly a decade and being just a 40 minute drive away from Boston where they have some of the best Dim Sum restaurants in the country, I can assure you that I know good Dim Sum when I taste it and Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant is miles from being in the same league as the worst Dim Sum restaurant in Boston.

On my first (and probably last) visit, I ordered just about everything on their Dim Sum menu. Traditionally, you're flagging down an attendant pushing around a cart and requesting them to lift up each lid so that you can peek at the deliciousness that is hidden underneath. If you want the item, they'll stamp your card (which is essentially your check) and scamper off to appease another table. They don't do that at this restaurant. Here, you order off a laminated menu with descriptions of the items, which certainly detracts from the Dim Sum experience.

All the items that I ordered were room temperature to cold. I've honestly had better shumai and har gow from the frozen food section of an Asian Supermarket. Some items were just inedible.  I hate wasting food and generally ask for to-go containers for my leftovers, but I can't imagine their food would taste any better hours later so I didn't.

I don't know if their other menu items are any good as I only went there for the Dim Sum, but Dim Sum is definitely not their strong point. I can't in good conscience recommend this restaurant to Dim Sum lovers or people with working taste buds. If you're craving simple Dim Sum items, go to the nearest G Mart or H Mart and buy some because Dim Sum Chinese Restaurant will do nothing to satisfy your craving for it.

I miss you, Chau Chow City. I await with bated breath, until our annual summer rendezvous, where I can once again ravish your hot, steamy buns.

I need a tissue."}
{"text":"Too greasy for me. But overall, not too bad. The staff was friendly and there's not that many options around here for dim sum. I will admit I've had better..but for NC, it'll do."}
{"text":"Before I went to China with a group from college we were brought here for the most authentic Chinese food Charlotte has to offer. Find a friend and make your way to Dim Sum!"}
{"text":"This place will surely satisfy anyone hankering for dim sum. This place has turned into one of my Sunday brunch standbys -- wait time is minimal, the dim sum carts come around regularly, and prices are ok . . . not cheap by NYC, Frisco or Toronto standards. What's good? The sticky rice in banana leaves, long shrimp rice, all the dumplings are good, and the Chinese broccoli.

I am taking a star away because they were missing some of my favorite dim sum staples: Almond tofu, congee and chive dumplings."}
{"text":"Been looking for a great Dim Sum place for a while and ran across this place which isn't too far from my place. I can't remember the name of the dish that I had, but it was delicious. My fiance and I went out on a limb and tried some shark fin dumplings and squid. While I'm quite familiar with shark anyway, being Caribbean, the squid kind of surprised me. For some reason I wasn't expecting it to be served cold, but it was still good. The texture kind of threw me off a little bit, as it has a slight \"crunch,\" but I still enjoyed it! I can't wait to come back to take part in the actual dim sum menu to see how good the options are!"}
{"text":"I like tapas. I like dim sum. I am a man that likes variety. 

Normally breakfast/brunch is crowded as heck, so we waited a little to grab food. 2pm was perfect. No carts, but the dim sum came out faaaast and it was hot and fresh. 

Dim Sum is pretty yum. Overall this place is a little pricey though. One of my favorite dishes, Chinese Broccoli (Chinese broccoli sauteed with oyster sauce, or garlic sauce) was $9.95. 

I still haven't seen the bano here, but the dining area looks pretty clean."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We were there at about 2 pm on a Sunday and there was no crowd to contend with.  We were seated in a corner of the side room.  The carts came by once, all at once, and we didn't see them again.  The dishes were barely warm and not at all tasty.  I used to bring my family here frequently about 6 or 7 years ago and it was a great experience.  Now I will not go back."}
{"text":"I didn't love it. I was really hoping to and wanting to but I'm not happy and satisfied with today's meal. We ordered the dim sum items for lunch. 10 dim sum items, an order of steamed rice, hot and sour soup, 4 drinks, and a lunch plate of sesame chicken plus 20% gratuity that was automatically added in for three adults, a 4 and 5 year old, and a baby in a high chair cost us $73. That's an absurd amount for just lunch considering we ordered just one of each dim sum to try. Some had two pieces, some had three, very few had four pieces. The flavors were good but when I'm paying $3.50 per dim sum dish, I'm expecting to be \"wowed\" and I was left feeling more like \"ehh.\" Prices were too high for what we got and paid for."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years and at last I'm writing my first review.

My first Dim Sum experience was Mirawa in LA's Chinatown.
The bar was set high because of that most excellent experience.

Since then I've had Dim Sum in San Francisco, New York and DC.

This place is a Charlotte highlight. CAUTION...if you attempt to compare this place to experiences in larger cities you'll be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is, Dim Sum in the CLT.

The food is authentic, fresh and affordable. During the week you  can order Dim Sum style from the menu. On the weekends they roll the carts with traditional fare.

Shaomi, har gow and char siu bau are all excellent. I would also recommend the chicken, pork or shrimp fried rice.

The tea is fair to average. We asked for Jasmine but it wasn't quite up to par.

You will get excellent service any time but expect a wait on weekends.

They have recently upgraded the carpet and fixtures.
Business is good."}
{"text":"I ordered the honey chicken to go and it took 20 minutes to get my food, only to later realize that there was no sauce on my chicken, and trying the chicken it was dry and chewy, overall would never go back."}
