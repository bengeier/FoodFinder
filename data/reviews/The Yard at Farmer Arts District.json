{"text":"Great food, you can go healthy or gorge on fantastic pub food.  The bartenders and staff were very friendly. On a Thursday night you'll find a mix of young professionals and ASU students, great beer and competitive Ping Pong. I imagine this place is awesome on game day. I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Garbage. Kids allowed at the bar but not the back room that we reserved? Are you F-ing kidding me? Overpriced food and Drinks. Great staff though. Better look for something else once this overpriced craze hits the chicken coop. Will choose other  venues."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Great for dinner, drinks, and some fun. 

Food Quality: great, but sometimes a hit or miss. Love the pretzel with cheese!!! Love the crispy shrimp Caesar salad, but sometimes they put too much dressing. 

Drinks: love their drinks, but they're pricey. I'm not too sure if they have a happy hour, but if they do, I would go more often. 

Service: staff are friendly and polite. 

Ambience: casual. Great for friends/family who want to have a nice/chill/fun evening. It does get a little cold when you're standing under their ceiling fans by the corn holes and ping pong tables. 

Parking: they have complimentary valet, which is very convenient when it gets later in the night. 

Overall, I love going here."}
{"text":"Hot food served cold...kitchen must have run out of every single spice including salt and pepper because everything was BLAND.  Fried chicken, terrible.  No taste, weird coating, chicken cold.  One of the most disappointing meals I've ever had anywhere.  Won't be going back.  Gave one star because the decor was pleasing."}
{"text":"Meh! It's just ok. First, the food was good and server was good. But it was hot. And humid or not, on hot summer nights (we were told) they turn off the misters at sundown? Not the greatest business plan. Manager on duty didn't offer us much in the way of help or improving our conditions.. Dew point was low so misters would have kept working just fine. If it's about dripping on the customers, well that's not good either. Plus, flies!!                                            And the wait inside for dinner on a Friday night was 1.5hrs? The food and atmosphere that night weren't worth that kind of wait. Bummer."}
{"text":"If you like Mill but dont like the loud, kid-filled wanna-be-Scottsdale bars/clubs then look no further. This is off the main strip and is much quieter and mostly filled with mid 20-30's who can actually drink and have fun with one another without looking like drunken 18 year olds. They have ping pong, sand bags, foosball, and other fun games. They also have huge \"loungey\" areas outside with little tables surrounded by big sectional couches. Great place for you and a group of friends to have a fun night. The only downside is the food is rather expensive."}
{"text":"#culinarydropout

the DOUBLE BLIND. its the only way to have fun there. besides those games if you can get to them. go early. only one shuffle board table hmm. wheres the skeet shooting.

HH (Happy Hour) drink deals and food is alright i suppose. but one's gotta eat after a mystery beer and mystery shot (see double blind, above). prepare for the best or worst shots of your life. its $6, as well as some of the food items.

its good with a group. and good with hangovers if you have more than 3 DB's (see double blind, above). the place is roomy, so get lost.

ive already been here 3 times. about 1.5 times more than needed. divided by double blinds that equals they should come to my place next time."}
{"text":"This place is too much fun! Came with some friends from out of town for the first time and had a blast. It was busy on a Friday night (go figure) but we sat on the patio and it was perfect, wasn't too hot at all. We had great service and great food. There is lots of fun games and the place is huge. Def our go to hangout :)"}
{"text":"We reserved a table for a birthday party, they required us to sign a contract which specified that we would spend at least $500. The birthday girl was intoxicated but nothing out of control, but because she walked to the bathroom with her arm around her best friend, they told me they would no longer serve anyone at our party. It was a crappy end to an otherwise nice night."}
{"text":"Pretzel fondue was f*cking amazing. There is no other way to put it. I also had the 36 hour pork ribs which made me one satisfied woman. Service was great and also got to enjoy dinner while listening to a local band. Go just go!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Our company's sales and marketing team came here yesterday for a celebratory lunch. The food was wonderful and the staff was amazing. Every staff member we encountered was super upbeat, helpful, and personable. While waiting for our food we played ping pong and corn hole. It was a blast! The service was great and fast so the boss was happy.  We ordered a plethora of items, but the Kale Salad with Chicken, Shrimp Salad, Pretzel Bites, and Pub Burger were all amazing! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Awful experience every time I have gone. We sit at the bar and the service is atrocious! We wait and wait and wait... For the food order to be messed up and another time forgotten about. It takes forever to get a drink and that's like I said at the bar. Their job is to be serving drinks. We sampled a beer did they come back to ask us how we liked it... Nope. Even people around us were complaining about the poor service and the wait time. Oh and there was no manager to be found. Employees were talking with fellow employees dropping the f word every other word. Other employees were on their cell phone. I was surprised to see how much free time the employees had. I would not waste my time, energy or money there again."}
{"text":"Fun environment and lots of drink choices. Good apps, but small dinner menu. Drinks cost more than food, so be careful"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very impressed with services. The waiter Conor was awesome .I shared with him my list of food allergies and next thing you know the General Manager  Jason took my list show it to the chef and I end  up having a great meal . Very grateful Thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great atmosphere. It can get pretty crowded but there's lots of room. Gorgonzola Chicken Salad is one of the best salads I've had anywhere."}
{"text":"If you drink Bud Light... good luck. They don't carry it. First bar in 20 years that has not carried Bud Light that isn't a micro brewery. Nice place other than that."}
{"text":"You go to the yard if you're a bro or want to go on a date but not actually speak to one another. It's insanely loud, extremely crowded and overall, not worth it. You can't connect with the person you're with, even hear the waitress/waiter speak. It's a good place to go on game day when you want to drink from a can and play ping pong. Sad to see Sam Fox make a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Great beer selection with happy hour. Big outdoor area with fun games. Good please to bring friends"}
{"text":"It's what you expect. Corn hole, ping pong, and other 'yard' games. It's fun with a group of friends. The best time to go is during happy hour, otherwise the drinks are overpriced. The service is usually good, and they let you hang onto your table while you go play (unless you're gone too long, and then you return to find your pretzels and cheese gone without warning). They have more sets of bags than corn hole boards though, so don't assume if you get a set that you are guaranteed to play (like we did). Overall, it's a fun time."}
{"text":"First, amazing food and fun games and sad to say, that's all that's good about this place.  The service from start to finish was awful.  First, the server had no idea what brand or flavor vodka they had, then when he went to go check if they had the one I asked about he came back said they ran out so I asked again what others they had he still didn't know.  Finally got a drink ordered and it was so strong I had to ask for more Sprite and it still was too strong.  Once we finished eating the amazing food, we had to sit there with all our dirty dishes in front of us while we waited for the server.  We then got a couple more drinks at the bar and played some games.  Those were fun but would have been nice if the tables were cleaned off because the food still sitting there smelled really bad.  When I went to cash out at the bar, stood there for 10 minutes with no acknowledgment at all and then when I asked for a soda to go, it was $3.50.  I am so disappointed with the service and will drive out of my way to the Phoenix location where the service is so much better."}
{"text":"Yeah I liked it.  Fox concepts always have an allure, and sometimes I've been disappointed sometimes I've liked it, sort of hit and miss really.  

Pros: parking wasn't bad, trendy clean all around, the pretzels are always a good choice.  My wife is being super conscious about ingredients these days and the server at culinary dropout was very helpful.  

Cons: none really, long wait for a group of twelve one Saturday without a reservation.  But honestly the four stars is because the joint is alright. Nothing to complain about, nothing that I'm chomping at the bit to go back for."}
{"text":"Yummy Food, Booze, and Fun = Ingredients for a great night.

I like The Yard a lot actually. I enjoy the more open concept that it has (thus \"the yard\") where people can just chill and hang around. I frequently suggest this place as a go-to when a group of my friends are trying to plan something. The games are a nice touch, and it makes it more than just a bar. The drinks are good. I haven't tried them all, but two I would suggest are:

Room service - because who doesn't like something bubbly
Smashed Irishman - I do not typically drink any of the ingredients in this (jameson, whiskey) but it didn't taste like it! I was surprised."}
{"text":"Had the Thai chile chicken wings and they were amazing. This place has a creative drink list and food menu and very knowledgeable servers. We had an all around great experience at this place."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and boy, I was so glad we did.  The food and drink specials were phenomenal!  The sangria was delish and the mixed drinks were excellent!  The food is not to missed.  We started with the preztels with cheese fondue.  I'm not sure what's in that cheese, but we couldn't stop eating it!  My teenage son ate about 8 of the pretzels- without even realizing it because they were so good!  We also tried the kale salad which I loved, the antipasti platter and the shrimp/chicken skewer.  All were generous portions except for the skewer.  I'd skip that next time.  The food was fresh and delivered in a timely fashion.  The vibe here is ecclectic- everything from very dressy to casual.  What a fun place!  Check out the patio with bags and couches to lounge on.  The only negative- and that's cause I'm a middle aged woman were some of the servers were skantily-clad- not really appropriate if you ask me (crop tops, braless, and tight workout bras)- but just fine according to my teenage sons!  A nice touch was the free valet parking- the lot was PACKED!"}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out to eat and drink. Lots of college age people hang out here since its close to ASU. They have all sorts of bar games if you can get to play them since they're always being used. I haven't tried to food to they have a good selection of drinks and lots of space to sit. Some even have a firepit. Would definitely recommend this as a hangout spot."}
{"text":"Love love love the environment. Tried the Downtown location when visiting on vacation. I have since moved here and Tempe is closer to where I reside so I tried the Tempe location.  Food choices are plentiful and prices reasonable. Service is great. I recommend this place for anyone. Whoever came up with the concept is a creative genius!"}
{"text":"This place is really fun, but if you try to sign up for Cornhole you'll never get to play. The system they have in place for people to \"sign up\" is not a system at all. Once a group of friends get some cornhole bags, they pass them between people. I even saw a group of older people pay someone $10 to get the bags next. I waited for 1 hour 45 minutes on the list then gave up. Too bad, that had potential to be cool."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and Dan was our bartender, he was extremely nice and recommended drinks and food according to what I told him I like which I really appreciated. Had a killer time here the whole staff was very hospitable."}
{"text":"It's opening night! I live close to The Yard on 7th st., but work very close to this location. So far, I'm quite impressed. The main differences are that the \"yard\" here is covered and valet parking is not mandatory here.

I spoke with the owner, Sam, tonight and he has been to the Katy Trail Ice House and to The Foundry in Dallas, where I moved here from. Those places follow this same business model, are extremely popular, and I've been to both many times. However, Lee Harvey's paved the way, in Dallas, for this type of establishment at least 30 years ago, and is one of my favorite places to go in all of Dallas. Anyway, I give this place two thumbs up!

I only gave it 4 stars because a double Jamison here costs over $20.

Ask for the 2 best bartenders Jake and Ivan."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Met some friends for the first time and it was cool. Food was good. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Never given a bad review in my life (look at my others) but I just have to put this out there. First let me say the hostess Logan is a babe!! Went here twice over the weekend. Friday night my family and I got in around 5. Not that busy of a time, our waiter was so nice, but completely forgot to put my sisters wings in, so she got her food right as we all finished. The kale shrimp Caesar is pretty good and so are the nachos but that's not what's wrong with this place. 
We went back last night to get some appetizers and play corn hole around 10, (which was fun), and my boyfriend forgot his keys because I had driven us. When we got back to my place he realized he was in a tow zone and needed to move his car. When we called to see if they were there they repeatedly told us no about 3 different times, then they magically found them. Then the guy on the phone said he wouldn't give them to him because he didn't want to be responsible for him drinking and driving.. but he wasn't drinking. Then we called back and another guy answered and said we could come get them and \"to do what we have to do\". So we drive back a little after closing time and knock on the door, the whole restaurant sees us and ignores him. Then the ASSHOLE manager comes out and says I'm not giving you your keys, I'm not going to be responsible for you and I asked if he could give them to me instead, as I was already driving my car and he said no and literally shut the the door in my  boyfriends face and locked it. I've never been so disrespected and appalled by a restaurant, and that is by far the worst manager running a business. It would have been one thing to handle the situation with care and have some remorse about my boyfriends car WHICH DID END UP GETTING TOWED if you insist on keeping his keys for no reason. Awful, just awful."}
{"text":"I've stopped by a few times for drinks and food. Very good food and relaxed atmosphere. If it's cool enough outside, you may have trouble getting in to play the games since the college kiddos take over that turf... But it's a fun spot!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at these locations, and they have an awesome looking banquet hall. The food was okay, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. My sister in law ordered a bowl of BUTTERNUT SQUASH CANNELLONI... she had maybe 4 noodles in it, which left most of the bowl completely empty. For a $15 dish, you should get more butternut squash for that cost, it costs next to nothing in the grocery store. My fiance and I shared a ITALIAN GRINDER and THE M.A.C. BURGER. Definitely go THE M.A.C. BURGER hands down. I expected the ITALIAN GRINDER to be warm and it just wasn't good cold. 

Atmosphere two thumbs up, food portions... two thumbs down. THE M.A.C. BURGER two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks, layout is sick!  Our waitress was amazing, Amy! Had a large group and a lot of tabs and she was all over it. If you like good music, chill environment this is a great spot...way better than somewhere on mill ave."}
{"text":"This place has everything to to become your favorite.   Exceeded my expectations.    Food great n large portions.  Bar... That... Fantastic.! Everything you can imagine  love this place.  Definitely will come back"}
{"text":"This is always a great place for a drink.  They have a great bar and we enjoy their appetizers. Their apps are priced right for the servings. They are smaller portions than you would find inmost restaurants but i actually prefer this. It allows us to order 3 or 4 apps for the same price as ordering 1 at other restaurants. 

While the drinks and apps are great, I'm not a fan of their dinner plates. That being said, the Fried Chicken is popular and has good flavor. 

The best thing and biggest issue I have with this restaurant is the location. I love that it's closer than the one on 7th street but it's right in the middle of ASU's campus. It can get a bit rowdy and loud depending on the time you go. I've found an early cocktail hour before dinner is the best time to go and be able to relax. Stay a little later and the energy increases."}
{"text":"Seems a very silly time to have a happy hour from two until four. When people are getting off of work they want happy hour at the time that they're getting off of work not at the time that they are working. The food is pretty good and the atmosphere is excellent."}
{"text":"My experience was a good one. We drove up and got the car valet because there was no parking. Put our names on the list to get a table and waited at the bar. Once we finally got a table we proceeded to our table as directed and brought along our pretzels and fondue. I had the Pub Burger and it was delicious. I love the ambiance, I love the food, and I love the music and staff. We had a slight incident with the general manager worth mentioning because in the end he was the upmost gentleman and treated us with care and kindness."}
{"text":"The Yard has a lot going for it. This sprawling food+fun complex houses a restaurant, bar, event space, and outdoor patio filled with games like ping pong, cornhole, shuffleboard, and more. It's this strange mix of upscale, chic, and laid-back party vibe at the same time. But it works on many levels, and my visit left me pleasantly surprised. 

First off, the food. I had the opportunity to sample a few things on the menu here, and was at times seriously impressed, and at times underwhelmed. First off, the pretzel bites with cheese fondue? Probably the best version of this I've ever had. Soft, warm, fresh-baked pretzel balls and a little fondue pot? Oh yeah. Bring it. However the staff-recommended fried chicken was merely passable. For a house specialty, it left me a little wanting. I tried some bites of a few other things that ranged from very solid to just okay. 

The service here is friendly, organized and on point. We had a large group and were well taken care of. The interior space shows off the serious cash spent outfitting it. Dark with fun lighting, TV's showing sports, and a loud, lively atmosphere. The indoor/outdoor structure of the place (only in a place like AZ) creates a nice open flow. Outside on the covered \"patio\", the feel is more \"upscale tailgate party\" with tons of games and beverages. There's also another large bar area in the back that seems to be for either VIP, special occasions, or exceedingly busy nights. 

This is totally a place I'd go with my bros to catch a game, some drinks and food. The games in the back make for a convivial atmosphere, and provide patrons with something to do other than just guzzle booze. 

I dig it."}
{"text":"I met up with a group of friends here for some food and drinks.   Being my first visit to any of the yard bars and restaurants I was pretty excited. I really like the inside and it's a nice change of pace from what is the Mill Avenue chaos of seedy college bars and people.   

I ordered the house made potato chips with French onion dip and for dinner I had a Caesar salad. Unfortunately both tasted bland and really could use some additional jazz.  

The staff was fine and the live band was rock'n.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and drink. Signature cocktails are pricey ($10-$12) but the \"brown bag special\" (random beer) is less than $2. Food is great. Definitely recommend the Mussels, Fried Chicken, and Turkey Pastrami. Most for the staff is great w/ the exception of a rude bartender/host here and there. Security and servers are great. Great games (ping-pong, cornhole, and shuffle board) plus live music. This place draws a diverse crowd as well. Great place for small or large groups. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a great bar/restaurant. I only came for the bar portion but an awesome play to spend a football Sunday. Plenty of tvs and a great array of games to play. They had several cornhole sets, ping pong and a shuffleboard table. Outside heaters keep you warm along with the outdoor firepits with plenty of comfy couches. Drink prices were reasonable with lots of great beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the coolest hang out spots in the Phoenix area. The yard is flat out awesome. The drink menu is extensive and the food is pretty damn good too. The best thing on the menu is the pretzel fondue. I love how open this yard is. There are about five corn hole stations and several ping-pong tables. Awesome hang out for a weekday or weekend night."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Phoenix location. Misters on the patio are inadequate. We were at the Phoenix location two nights ago, it was 4 degrees warmer out and their patio was sooo much more comfortable."}
{"text":"Best spot ever for a first date, second date, and you've been together for 5, 10, 20 years date!
After enjoying a group dinner at Culinary Dropout we popped over to the Yard for a fun game of corn hole. They have several game stations set-up, along with ping pong tables. I am terrible at corn hole. Possibly the worst in the entire world and I apologize if you are one of the many innocent bystanders that I accidentally hit with a bean bag. It was not intentional and my teammates can vouch for me since it's quite obvious that I have zero ability to hit anything I am actually aiming at. Even though I made a complete fool out of myself I'd happily go back and do it again!"}
{"text":"So cool that this place offers cornhole and ping pong- this is my type of place! Perfect for people of all ages to come with their friends or plan on making new friends."}
{"text":"SO FUN! Everything from the decor, service, food, drinks and games were on point!! We loved it here. It's funky inviting vibe matched he friendly service. The food was delicious and beers were just as good. 

Our kids loved the yard games! 

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great afternoon lunch & brunch spot! Fresh squeezed on tap, fish & chips and more. Open air but out of the sun!  Worth the traffic jam to get here!"}
{"text":"A good alternative place to get drinks and hang out with your friends or maybe grab dinner and pregame before starting a alcohol fueled night of debauchery on mill. They have a lot of seating and a mellow atmosphere with games to keep your company and yourself entertained. They have a good beer selection and full bar with your usual fare to their awesome specialty drinks to choose from so no problem on that side."}
{"text":"I enjoy the vibe, the games and that they seek locally sourced food (according to the waitress). Food is good. I enjoy that they offer unique blends of flavor a with both food items and drinks. The smashed Irishman drink was surprisingly tasty."}
{"text":"Drinks and fun at the Yard Temp last night. The Moscow mules are amazing. We especially like the ginger candies."}
{"text":"Talk about a fun place to bring a date.  Ping pong, beanbags, pretzels, what more could you want?  If it were me, I would do away with the fancy dining area altogether and make it a true college hangout destination."}
{"text":"One star for mandatory valet if you arrive before 6p. No one should be forced to let a stranger drive their car"}
{"text":"Culinary dropout has one of the best atmospheres of all the restaurants in the Mill Ave district, or even Tempe alone. This restaurant is HUGE and can accommodate large parties and corporate events. On the covered patio there are multiple games such as ping pong and corn hole. One bar in the main restaurant and another on the other side of the patio. There are many good drinks on the menu (room service) but the food is my favorite. You must order the pretzel balls as an appetizer- they are served with warm cheese dip being heated on top of a candle. Delish. My favorite salad on the menu is the Gorgonzola chicken salad. It is literally chicken salad with Gorgonzola cheese on top of a bed of lettuce. Another great option is the turkey pastrami sandwich. You should also try the grilled cheese sliders and their entrees. There is also dessert options on the menu. The menu is not overwhelming, it is actually kind of small, but each item on it is SO GOOD. Great location near the bars on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Honestly, 2 drinks that I had were not delicious. O. Giving 5 stars because of Nima, ty really hard working barback who should really be a bartender!) He was the one who asked me if I needed anything else, I think he is a cleaning freak in a good way as he made every just perfect! Really! I. Visiting from Boston and I have never seen such a service!"}
{"text":"I over heard a guy and a girl talking about how much they like corn hole.
I looked at them like a cow looks at an oncoming train. You could hear my eyelids blinking in confusion through the silence until another, more savvy Canadian at our table filled in the gaps for me...

\"It's that bean bag game, Dale.\" Suddenly it all makes sense!

The Yard is awesome. It's like a gentrified version of cousin Cletus' famous family BBQ - Fried chicken, pretzels, fire pits and games galore, including (you guessed it) Corn Hole! Maybe I'm taking this a little far. The Yard is by no means redneck. It's relaxed and quite lovely - you could hang out here after work, bring the the kids, go on a date, or yell belligerently about your college football team late at night. I have no doubt that this place must draw quite the party crowd on weekend nights, but you don't need to be that crowd in order to have a good time here.

The food is and upscale version of American comfort classics. Even though I was pretty fooded-out by the time I arrived, I still suckered myself into the fried chicken and I regret nothing. So dang delicious and served with a sweet sauce and a slice of corn bread."}
{"text":"Tempe's new hot spot! 

Its about time Culinary Dropout and the Yard showed up in Tempe! 

Have been here a few times on cold nights and they have enough space heaters and fire pits to keep everyone warm. 

Having two bars makes getting drinks really easy. 

Good atmosphere and great concept!"}
{"text":"Go with friends, nice place and taste food! But the music is kind of loud. I hang out with a group of people, we cannot hear others clearly somehow :)"}
{"text":"This place is huge! They have painted walls when you first walk through. Then you go through another set of doors and it's dark with candles lit on one side and the other side they have private rooms. The kitchen is on the side with the candles and you can see in. The bathrooms were very clean! It was also pretty neat that their is a peek-a-boo hand washing station for the men and women bathrooms, a mirror separated them.

After the dark hallway you see a huge room with a bar (this part is still AC) then another room after that , it has cute lighting and is considered outside seating. They have misters so it wasn't to bad! They have awesome furniture throughout! 

After the seating they have fun games set up: ping pong, bag-o, and shuffle board. YOU HAVE TO BE 21 & OVER TO GET IN, have your ID 

Then they have another huge room with nice seating and another bar! 

FoOd: appetizers were all super good!!! The wings were my personal favorite, so crunchy and they melt in your mouth!! The sauce on he side was bomb! We also tried the pita bread with hummus, chips and dip (so good and creamy), the bbq nachos were also really delicious!! For food I had the MAC burger lettuce wrapped and it was so juicy! My sister had the same with the bun it was huge! (Pictured) the fish and chips smelled really good and it didn't look greasy at all! The others had salads that were huge and looked tasty. Highly recommend checking it out if you haven't already.

Super fun and they have live music inside!"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome. They have ping pong, shuffleboard, corn hole, and a foosball table! Not to mention the fire pits by the tables and live music for a really cool atmosphere. They close at 1am though and had to kick us and a bunch of ppl out. It's weird, everywhere else is open until 2."}
{"text":"Food was ok. A hip place for college kids though people of all ages were there. Has a nice area to play wormhole while waiting for your table.
They could turn the volume down. It's hard to hear and carry on a conversation.
Had to wait an extra 10 minutes for one of the meals. The coleslaw served with the fish and chips was too salty to eat.
Had to wait too long for dessert. There are various seating situations. We ended up with metal chairs with no cushions. Not real comfortable after a while. This is about half the seating type they have.
Almost have to use their valet parking as it is limited.
Wasn't a great experience."}
{"text":"Some friends and I had a nice brunch here! Mimosas were great, food was good. Atmosphere was awesome. We played some cornhole before we ordered food. Was a total great time. Waiter was awesome and funny. Only small complaint was that I ordered my eggs over easy and they weren't really. But will totally come back and tell people about the place! :)"}
{"text":"Blah blah blah blah hipsters everywhere!

They are coming for us all, ugly shirts and manbuns will be the end of our society. But I like food, beer and games, so this place is chill."}
{"text":"Food is good,  same menu as other Culinary Dropouts. Service is great and location is very convenient for ASU area. Unlike the other Yard (Phoenix), this location has plenty of parking, a plus! But unlike the other Yard, this location does not have a good layout. There are large closed off Reserve areas, that may be great corporate meeting get spaces, but it creates large blocked off walls in an otherwise open \"Yard\". There does not appear to be any other restaurants on site or nearby. The game area, patio seating and restaurant don't feel as unified -- so the whole experience suffers. This Culinary Dropout is really just a stand alone restaurant... Which is OK if all you wanted was the dining. But really disappointing if you were expecting the same casual playful experience and dining options as Phoenix location."}
{"text":"If you've been to Culinary Dropout before then you know what the food will taste like here because this is a combination of Culinary Dropout with a twist! 

Come here if...

- you want to watch a sport's game
- you want to drink with your friends
- you want to go on a fun yet entertaining date night 
- you like to play games such as bocce ball and ping pong 
- you like a fun atmosphere 

This is a great option for a bar/restaurant just off of Mill. Be warned that it does get crowded, so come during an off time if you don't want to wait. 

The atmosphere here is a lot of fun. They have TVs everywhere, plenty of seating (tables, fire pit seating, etc). They have an entire section dedicated to games including bocce ball and ping pong. It's just an overall fun atmosphere!

As for food, my go-to favorites are the pretzel fondue and the Turkey Pastrami sandwich."}
{"text":"Very awesome atmosphere!!! The outside \"yard\" area is great. Couches with firepit tables. They have ping pong, shuffle board,  bean bag toss for your entertainment . There is staff helping all the time. The bar runs slow but great drinks. Food was great."}
{"text":"This place is so close to my house! uh-oh... new hang out spot! It is a great new place- very spacious and still has the Fox Concepts touch! I had the beer cheese soup and a side salad paired with a lumberyard hef beer! It has a smaller \"yard\" area but still just as fun and intriguing. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really dig the feel and look of this place.  Great beers on tap too!"}
{"text":"The Yard is one of my favorite bars to go to in Tempe. They almost always have great live music (last Friday they had a terrible metal/rock band - I think that's what they were supposed to be) and a super fun atmosphere with ping pong, corn-hole, etc. I love the beers they have on draft too, and most of their cocktails are great! I recently had the Soiled Dove, which I think is new, and I highly recommend it! 

Other favorites of mine are their pretzels and cheese, and their nachos are amazing. They have a really good breakfast menu too, which I think is quite a bit better than their dinner options."}
{"text":"Fun place, check out the bathrooms. Trip ya out, be ready too share your mirror with opposite sex, but you never know now a days, lol....."}
{"text":"Never been to the Yard for brunch. Not going again. There is not a wide selection on the menu, but we liked the captain crunch french toast and turkey pastrami. Service is TERRIBLE. Asked multiple servers for ketchup, and by the end of the meal still didn't get it. The wait for the check took FOREVER. If you're looking for a night out drinking/playing games - come here. If you're looking for quality service & an attentive server, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good place to start a happy hour or girls night before it becomes a club and Scottsdale bar wanna be, along with the clientele that lures in. The food here has always been consistently good and they have a good mix of cocktails and craft beer to chose from. This place tries way too hard to fit the hipster vibe in my opinion."}
{"text":"Food: 
Connected to Culinary Dropout 
Excellent appetizers & craft beer 

Fun: 
Shuffleboard
Ping Pong
Cornhole
Foosball

This place is huge!  Plenty of space for large groups and also totally suitable for small groups as well.  It felt like a big block party with a bar at each end.  There are multiple TV's all around so you won't miss a game of any kind.  Just an all around good time going on here."}
{"text":"For weeks, I'd been hearing from my husband about how cool \"the new Yard\" building was in Tempe.  He went to check out the Madison Improvement Club when they first opened and then visited again to see the Yard / Culinary Dropout.  (If only I could get him to exercise at the MIC in addition to visiting... but that's another story!)

So when Jared suggested we head over there on Saturday for lunch with the kids, I was game... literally.  (They have several games for customers including a cool grass turf area with bean bags and several ping pong tables as well).  My toddlers loved it!

In addition to great ambiance, I found the staff at this latest FRC concept to be super friendly and attentive, and the food was awesome too!

I ordered an egg white frittata for myself - it was huge, healthy, filling and I loved it!  The kids shared an order of chicken tenders and fries and The Yard's famous Captain Crunch coated French Toast.  Jared and his dad had Fried Chicken and Biscuits... needless to say, all was filling and we left with full bellies.

Gotta love a restaurant that caters to college kids, adults, and is family-friendly in addition.  I look forward to returning for cocktails, more of the menu items, live music, and those comfy couches with fire pits during future visits.  I hope to be invited to a private party in their event space as well... This is definitely a cool newcomer to Tempe, and compelling reason to go outside of my usual 2 mile radius!"}
{"text":"My friends and I attended the grand opening last night after receiving a few VIP invites.  We had a great time.  The appetizers were delicious, the drinks were tasty, and the staff was friendly. There is plenty of room to sit and relax with your friends much like you would in your back yard (if your backyard had wait staff and bartenders). Also, there were many tables if you'd prefer to sit down and have a meal. There were plenty of games to play and televisions if you're into watching a game. I would recommend The Yard to anyone looking to have a fun night out with good food and attractive people, all while avoiding  having to stand for hours and being overcrowded."}
{"text":"Someone is trying too hard to make this an \"arts district\".  Where's the art?"}
{"text":"Came here for a happy hour for a farewell/good luck party and loved it!  The space is large and it is not so loud and crowded you can't hear yourself think.  Food from Culinary Drop Out is delicious.  Service is great, super attentive, and friendly.  We had the pretzel fondue & chicken nachos.  No issues with split the bills to treat the guest of honor."}
{"text":"The service was great. We didn't make a reservation,  and after waiting 15 minutes on a busy Friday night we were seated near the live band. The food, especially the pork belly nachos, were awesome. We felt very relaxed and not rushed at all. This is a great place to come hang out with friends and family."}
{"text":"Maybe the coolest bar I've ever seen in my life. Lots of fun things to do, 2 bars (at least), a band, indoor fire pits, ...

WARNING ABOUT IDs: Unfortunately I had a cousin from California with a valid vertical drivers' license that said she was over 21 but they didn't let her in. I don't know if this is a problem with the bar or an Arizona law but it made an otherwise fantastic night a little sad. What is someone supposed to do in this case when they have a 100% legal and valid form of ID but cannot use it because of some strange rule? There was no way of knowing about this rule ahead of time.

I'd definitely return here again though."}
{"text":"Trendy, fun happening place! 

Location: This is off Farmer in Tempe.  Parking includes valet and self-parking, plus street parking.  I went on a Monday night; there were ample spots available. 

Food:  Lots of interesting choices, like pretzel bites with cheese fondue, hummus, mini cheese sandwiches, cheese plate, salads, popcorn, and more.  I did not eat much at the time, but the pretzels were delicious, warm and soft.   Happy hour offers cheaper prices for drinks and eats.   The sangria on the happy hour menu was just $3.00 for a decent amount. The sangria was one of the best I've had!  

Service:  Pretty good for a busy place.  The Yard in Phoenix did not have great service, but our servers were excellent and always checking in on our huge table of over 12 people. 

Ambiance: Fun place with seating on long tables with hard chairs or couches in circles.  There are games, like bean bags, ping pong, etc."}
{"text":"Its a nice place with the perfect combination of casual and fine dining. The food is decent and servers are very good. But the price of things pinch a little coz its in Tempe and well, we aren't really used to paying that much money for meals. Was it worth it? It was my friend's birthday, which meant that the dessert was complimentary, so yea. But otherwise, not really. 

We got the slightly over-rated fried chicken and the delightful rainbow trout. 

I'd be back for happy hour though."}
{"text":"GREAT atmosphere. Lots of room for parties. Omission GF Pale Ale is in the house. Love the idea of ordering antipasti off card. Not a fan of the marinated olives( not a good first impression if you have to spit seeds out on first date) chips & French onion dip good if you don't mind greasy! Deviled eggs were the bomb( can I still say bomb on a public forum) I will be back"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here! Great for a laid back beer or classic cocktail. Good mix of people"}
{"text":"Consistently a great go to location to hangout with friends for some good food and drinks. I love the pretzel and cheese fondue. So good! The servers are interesting... I would suggest some more staff that are professional and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is always fun, food is great.  I give it three stars out of 5 because of the service.  No matter how good the food, you simply can not forget sitting around waiting for your bill.  We waited 30 minutes for some attention from the bartenders who were busy getting everything cleaned up and ready to close.  Not busy tonight, just neglectful. We were prepare to put in another food order but time ran out and no one checked on us so we will take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really fun place to hang out at, so much going on at one time.  You have tv's, cornhole, ping pong, a live band.  Food was very good, had the turkey pastromi sandwich.  Had one of their speciality cocktails which was extremely overpriced.  You can down it in 5 sips.  Waitress was awesome and very friendly, food came out quick.  Definitely going back even though I live nowhere close to this place."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I recently moved from San Diego and have been searching for a bar that had similar vibes. This is a great place to come and hangout with 1 friend or a bunch of friends. It's a very big venue with plenty of parking and plenty to do. They have cornhole, ping-pong, shuffle board, and lots of seating. I have not yet tried the food, but the drinks and service have been great so far. I will definitely be back... If you're up for a fun surprise try the $2 brown bag beer (disclaimer: it probably won't taste great.) ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This restaurant/bar exceeded my expectations! The space itself is really cool, with a nice industrial/hipster vibe.  They also had an outdoor area (with misters since the heat isn't a joke) with some ping pong tables.  

I expected the food to be just so so but they really follow through with their claim that everything is made from scratch.  We tried the thai chicken wings, salmon, and korean rib eye cap and all three were very tasty and well seasoned.  The chicken wings had a lot of flavor and were piping hot out of the fryer.  The slaw and peanuts added a nice complimenting texture and acidity to the wings.  The salmon had a nice golden brown sear and was still moist on the inside.  The black rice and vegetables were also nicely prepared.  The korean rib eye was cooked to my specifications (medium rare) and super flavorful, with a lot of spice and salt.  

Drinks here are also really tasty, unique, and reasonably priced. 

Finally, I really liked the service here.  They kindly offered to split our entrees once they heard we planned to share and plated the split dishes as if they were individual portions.  I would definitely recommend coming here for a night out or romantic date.  Can't wait to return next time I'm in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Disappointing visit last night. Sat on patio in the late afternoon and we were fine until they turned off the misters at sunset in 103 degree heat.   The stakes were raised when the flies invaded and didn't leave. We asked a manager for some kind of help or relief, but only got apologies.  Server and food were good as usual, but the experience of marinating in our own juices while playing hand to hand combat with flies dive bombing our food will make us think again about coming back."}
{"text":"I am proud to be the first reviewer of the brand spanking new Yard location in Tempe which, by the way, does not actually hard open until December 9, 2014.  

Yesterday (Wednesday, December 3, 2014), one of my buddies heard that the new Tempe location of The Yard / Culinary Dropout was open for business and asked me if I was interested in checking it out.  Being a somewhat regular patron of the location in Phoenix, and a fan of the concept in general, I happily accepted the invitation.  We rounded up another buddy, and the three of us headed to The Yard at about 5pm.   

We arrived and entered via the (wet paint) front most entrance, walked down a long corridor, and were greeted with exactly what we expected from The Yard, a very cool open space with both an interior restaurant and covered exterior patio lounge setting with Yard games and a huge bar separating the two areas.  A new addition to the concept, the massive patio space has it's own large bar at the end of the venue that can be closed off and turned into a separate private area.  There were perhaps 60-70 people milling about, dining or enjoying cocktails.  Considering that they have a capacity of nearly 800 patrons, it did not seem busy.  We sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender -- who through a roundabout conversation told us that they were not yet open for business!   All of the people we saw eating, drinking and interacting were employees participating in real world training!   

\"But\", said the bartender, \"here are some menus for you to take a look at -- hang out for just a moment and I'll be right back\".

Up walks Jason, the General Manager.   Jason reiterates that the hard open is not until December 9th, but that our timing was impeccable.  \"Gentlemen, prepare yourselves to the the first real customers of the Yard and Culinary Dropout -- except with a catch...try a few of our specialty drinks, try some food, and it's all on the house tonight\".   

We were then immediately greeted by our mixologist for the evening, Nick, who spent about 2 hours with us demonstrating his amazing knowledge of everything on the food and drink menu.  

We enjoyed the following cocktails --  On the \"Two Handed Shandies\" list, the Deviant Behavior.  On the \"Classic Dropouts\" list, the Creature of Habit, Smashed Irishman and Every Which Way But Loose.  On the \"Light & Easy\" list, the My Suffering Bastard.  Each drink was perfectly balanced, and amazing.   The three of us could not find a bad word to describe these drinks.   Put them ALL on your \"Must Try\" list!  

In there somewhere, we noticed what looks like a \"Jameson\" beer tap handle with a big red Christmas bow on it.   Inquiring minds must know!!!  Result:  We were each treated to a rocks glass of the Culinary Dropout's very own Christmas Jameson blend.   Think Fireball....except more refined, more upscale, more sophisticated.  Sexier.  This will blow your taste buds away as you sip it. PUT THIS ON YOUR \"MUST TRY\" LIST!  

Also between other beverages, we were each treated to a sampling of the ON TAP Pinot Grigio.  Very cool concept, and quite a good wine with a somewhat sweet aroma and a nice balanced finish.  The ladies will love this.   

During all of this amazing cocktail time, Nick took the opportunity to put us together a massive Antipasti board.   We received a huge portion of hot capicola and jamon iberico off the meats list.  From the cheese list, the truffled crescenza, the prarie breeze cheddar along with a few accouterments.  From the snacks list, the toasted ciabatta, garlic oil & balsamic.  The iberico is imported from Spain and it is expensive.  My girlfriend was in Madrid last month and returned with some iberico (oops -- sorry US Customs!), so I knew we were getting a treat.  We were not disappointed!  Nick even schooled us on the very expensive precision machine used to slice the meats.  All I can say is...what an experience!   

To top it all off, we received a basket of the (now famous) soft pretzels & house made provalone fondue. I have to believe this will be their single most ordered item.  Recreate this exact spread we received and you'll not go away hungry!   

In close -- Tempe will love this place.  The sister location in Phoenix is wildly popular, and I fully expect that this new location in Tempe will have the effect of bringing just the right blend of the college contingent and the 20-40's crowd from Tempe.  Sam Fox is a genius for picking this location.   

Jason the GM had a choice when my friends and I walked in last night thinking The Yard was open for business.  He could have asked us to come back once they were open and we would have understood -- but instead he treated us to an extremely unique experience that we will not forget -- and we hope that they will not forget us.  

We will be back, probably on December 9, and we will bring friends!"}
{"text":"First, I have to give our server, Madison props for being such a great service minded woman. I ordered the nachos but don't like everything heaped on top and she asked chef to separate everything. And it was so good! So was my drink, amazing!"}
{"text":"I really dig this place. The food is good, the vibe is fun and the servers are super nice. Some things I would love to see improvement on would be servers checking in more often, especially in the summer when it's 110 degrees outside, waters need to be filled more often. Doubt this will change but I literally spent $10 on a Stella Artois. Not a huge one, just normal sized. Not exactly cheap. However, the food and the monkey bread make it damn worth some of the small things that need to be fine tuned!"}
{"text":"Great addition to Tempe! The one in Phoenix is awesome and this one is better. Great open concept and the flow is well. A bit different layout which works well. Good backdrops to increase the experience."}
{"text":"Wow - what a funky cool place.  Met a colleague here this evening for an early dinner and I was just blown away by the great food and service!!  Our server was beyond stellar.  She knew the entire menu and made great great recommendations. 

The food was incredible and...and...despite this place being large enough to hanger 4 Boeing 747s...the food came crazy fast.  Amazing. I'll be back for sure - it's a no brainer!!"}
{"text":"New favorite spot. Huge Open space with games, live music and awesome menu. A must go when in Tempe."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times - and its always a great time.
Food is superb, great choices of beers and beverages and the games area out the back makes this place a fun and cool place to hang out with friends.
I have been here again since I checked in (this review is quite late) but it always delivers and is certainly a favorite haunt for us and our friends.

I don't want to go overboard but the food choices were great, as we have friends that are GF and non-red meat eaters - this place always has choices that are tasty and look after those with any particular food requests..

The Yard - The best..."}
{"text":"I popped in for a quick drink with some co-workers and had a great customer service experience. Three very friendly and helpful bartenders took great care of our group and the happy hour offerings are plentiful. I recommend the food here if you are hungry, the wings cannot be missed and are not offered at their Phoenix location. The patio was booked for a private event but otherwise I love going out to play bag toss or one of the other yard games they have set up. Awesome place to go with a group for drinks or special casual occasion"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday for lunch, 4 of us, repeat customers. We all looked forward to the beer battered fish, and the lunch was on point. Enjoyed a game of ping pong and a cold beer too. Will return for the fish and chips as well as a game of ping pong. Nicely done."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Such a great environment, but sometimes the food feels a little lackluster. The moscow mules are TDF though, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved this place and its atmosphere!!! Only suggestion would be more servers around the game areas. Had to go to bar in order to get a drink...I will be back!"}
{"text":"This area is huge, with a store, 2 event rooms, restaurant, bar, games, and tons of seating (Indoor and outdoor) all in one. We went here on a warm Sunday afternoon, a perfect lightly breezy day to indulge in some light bites, drinks, and games while catching up with friends. The outdoor patio has multiple tables and tufted couch seating areas to accommodate any number of guests. Our party of 20+ people took up 3 couch areas and there was still room for a baby shower being hosted right next to us with an equally large number of people. Note that they do not accept reservations for large parties unless you are willing to go through their event planner, so if you are going to try to get a large group together here for a more informal outing come early to claim your space!

The games offered here are ping pong, cornhole, and I did see a foosball table in the corner. There are about 4-5 tables of ping pong and an equal number of cornhole boards. You can rent the equipment with an ID, and it's first come first serve.

The food and drinks are from Culinary Dropout, and we ordered a few appetizers to share. The pretzel fondue is always a sure winner, and I also enjoyed the pork belly nachos as well. The hummus had a beautiful presentation but was just OK to me. I also tried some potato chips which were delightfully crunchy and crispy, with a dip that tasted like a mix of ranch and French onion dip.

The outdoor patio is semi-secluded with high wooden walls but enough open space to let you see the surrounding area. Oftentimes you will see either the Light Rail or freight trains go by. The music here is loud enough that you won't really hear anything going on outside the restaurant and when we were here they had a live performance by someone doing cover songs.

Service was good and we were checked on as needed. Since all the servers here look like they stepped out of an Urban Outfitters ad and there isn't any standard dress for them, it's hard to tell who is working here and who is here as a paying customer. 

Overall, it's a nice area to chill, play games, and enjoy some tasty food."}
{"text":"I never knew this place was there until a friend mentioned it to me. Cool warehouse feel - shops, restaurant, and a bar in the back. Management and staff were very helpful. I like the brown bag special for $2 where the beer inside is a mystery. I will definitely stop back and spend more time!"}
{"text":"Well this place is super fun! Not only does it carry the great drinks and food from Culinary Drop Out, you get a completely different atmosphere then the normal restaurants and bars. First off, most of the place is outside, under shade of course, has 2 large bars, ton of places to sit and to top it off all kinds of games! Yes games, cornhole, ping pong.... its really entertaining to watch people play or get a group together and play while having a few drinks! Downside is this place is always packed and you have to get their early to be able to play any of the games, or wait a while for your turn. Another plus, huge TV's everywhere, so if you wanna catch a game you definitely can! Its a mix of hipsters, college students, corporate people, sometimes families with kids, it has a little bit of everything for everyone. Great food, decent service, awesome atmosphere! Good place to kick back, relax and enjoy your time out!"}
{"text":"I usually have better experiences at Culinary dropout, but my most recent visit seemed to lack its usual quality. I did not notice them being too busy, however, the time that it toke for our waitress to check in on us or get us refills really put a damper on my day. I still would recommend people going there. The pretzel bites are amazing and they have a very solid fish and chips. I won't let this one experience ruin this restaurant for me, but it put a temporary bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Went back and had a server named River and he was wonderful! He was so knowledgable and offered so many suggestions! My boyfriend and I frequent there a lot and some of the suggestions he had to switch up on the entrees we had never even thought were possible! Being a server, I have high expectations and River completely surpassed hem and even made me reevaluate my own server techniques! Might have to incorporate some of the things he did to perfect my serving game :) 

He was awesome!"}
{"text":"For the love of fried chicken and pretzel amaze balls! Today the house infused Jameson's has impressed me like none other. It's a chilly day here in Phoenix so I enjoyed mine with coffee and some house made whip cream...delish! Service here is always fabulous. Tourist or native, hungry or celebrating Sunday Funday make it your place...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here. They have a wide array of food and beverages, it's a great place to get together with friends, and there's so much room for activities!!!!

Last time we went here, we had the pork belly nachos. If there had been more pork belly pieces, I would have been happier, but they were pretty decent. I also had one of their cocktails and it was quite tasty. 

On another occasion, I've had the pretzel rolls and provolone fondue. Best bread and cheese combination ever! Well, maybe not \"ever\", but completely delicious.

While enjoying food and beverages, patrons can play cornhole, ping pong, and watch numerous sporting events on their TVs. 

All of this makes more an enjoyable time out :)"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe of this place! Great food and even better service! Great for groups as a variety of different seating styles to suit your tastes."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend on a Sunday and had a good time. Nice big bar, super friendly bar and wait staff. If it wasn't 110 degrees it would have been nice to go and sit outside in there outdoor area and maybe play a game or two. But overall a very nice experience"}
{"text":"What a great addition to Tempe. Being a fan of good comfort food, cocktails, live music and games, The Yard is made for me!! I've been to the Yard in Central Phoenix and I would have to say I like this one better. Better ambiance and feel to it. The servers are super attentive and friendly, the food is fantastic, the booze is spot on, the music sets the tone and the games bring out my competitive side. Make sure you check out the Showcase room! Super cool place to have private parties. The Yard kicks ass, oh and so did I in foosball and bags!!"}
{"text":"I expected this location to be similar to the one in PHX: underwhelming and overpriced. However!!! I experienced something much better.  It just seems a bit more quant..put together..and a place that encourages interaction between  guests and invites you to truly enjoy yourself.Maybe its just the new place...the layout (additional bar outside) or the low key yet swanky atmosphere....
I'm not totally sure. This place deserves the hype."}
{"text":"This place has a fun environment. I had grilled cheese sliders which were really good. I really enjoyed their unique moscow mules and the bartenders were phenomenal. There is also a waiter there named Craig who I believe just started who was really sweet. Great place for huge groups or possibly even a first date!"}
{"text":"This has been one of the worst experiences since I started coming. Server Nya didn't write down our order and got it completely wrong. Never brought us our beer or nachos. It took us 30 min to pay. I will not be coming back to this one. The one in Old Town is a much better run business. Sad to write this review."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! It is perfect for a date or a birthday dinner. Very social and open floor plan that promotes mingling. 

The good was good but their drink selection was impressive. The bartenders get busy but are very good at helping you pick the perfect evening elixir for you. Def worth a visit for a Friday night out, or a Sunday Funday with the girls/guys"}
{"text":"Came here for a company awards dinner. Everything was excellent. The facilities are as described on their webpage, industrial, rough hewn, but classy. The staff was friendly, and polite ( although...My water glass never got refilled once all night. But with an open bar, who needs water?) 
Also, regarding the staff: there are some damn fine hipster beards on display here. None of those shabby hillbilly Gruffs; all were well groomed and structured meticulously. 
I had steak: excellent, with a salt and herb crusted. Wife had chicken, which was also excellent, but so small it would fit in Donald Trump's tiny paws with no overhang. Maybe upsize? Not huge, just a wee larger."}
{"text":"So excited Fox brought the concept to Tempe! Such a great place to have a low key night with friends and be in a great atmosphere. There are ping pong tables and couch seating areas with little fires for you to lounge and just enjoy the company. A huge space too, so you can really just hang out and not feel overly crowded, even when it is crowded! 

The service was beyond slow, so I'm hoping that is just new staff jitters and they will work it out. We ordered food, and the food came out before my glass of water that I had ordered from our server. And, it took almost 20 minutes between her grabbing our card and check off of the table to bringing it back to us to sign and leave. 

I'll definitely be coming back though. A great location and a great place to meet friends in a pretty central location but avoid the college craziness that Mill Ave can be!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Fried Chix entree and my hubby had the Fish and Chips.  Both were tasty-and the portion size acceptable.  Love the vibe-very open, energetic and hip!"}
{"text":"Ok so this place is big and can be overwhelming but they know how to run it to a tee. We had a surprise birthday party for my friends 40th bday and I couldn't be happier. Every employee there was very nice but our main server(Ashley) was absolutely exceptional. I don't how she keeps track of a big party but this gal with red hair does it with charm and ease. Kudos to the place and thank you Ashley for making my friends bday extra special."}
{"text":"I was the other patron with Scott M who wrote the first review. He went into great detail of our experience so I will limit mine. All I have to say is the drinks were amazing. The smashed irishman was an awesome drink. I love how balanced and uniquely crafted the drinks were. They go into great detail when making these drinks and they could be loaded with various types of spirits and you would not have a clue what was in it. Everything balances out to bring a wonderful drink to your mouth. Nick was our bartender and he was on top his game. He answered all the hard questions we through at him and explained all the different items on the menu both food and drink. Jason the GM was great as well. Very thankful for him to give us the ultimate VVIP (very very important person) experience before they were even open to the public. The soft opening is tonight and the hard opening is December 9th. I'll be back on December 9th with friends and other family members to say hello to Nick and Jason and enjoy some great food and amazing drinks and toss a few bags around as well. 

This is going to be a great hit for Tempe. It will bring a nice diverse crowd and not so much the college scene as it will be for everyone. Keep in mind its no longer referred to as Mill Ave but now \"Downtown Tempe\" with new businesses going up just off Mill Ave such as Postino's, east of Mill and now The Yard and The Lodge west of Mill. It's more of a district that you can enjoy vs a single strip of bars. 

Lastly, parking is not an issue here. This is a huge bonus for them with an adjacent lot that has 800 parking spots available which is free after 4pm. You can easily park, play, eat and go home. No fighting for traffic spots and walking a distance to get to your destination."}
{"text":"The Yard was a pleasant surprise that more than exceeded my expectations for a large, popular dining establishment in Tempe. Those preconceived notions conjured up images of bland food and a menu similar to something like an Applebee's. Boy, was I wrong. And I certainly wasn't expecting to perfect my cornhole game in the process. 

My group sat down at a long table we had reserved ahead of time. I could spend a lot of time on flowery descriptions of our dishes, but that just echoes the sentiment of many a previous review. For me, the meal began and ended with the pretzels and cheese. These soft, warm, sweet/savory-on-the-outside bites of heaven, along with a healthy dipping into their signature cheese sauce, were the best I've ever had when it comes to pretzel appetizers. I could have easily demolished a few baskets, and in hindsight I probably should have. Carbs be damned. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of other strong points on the menu (like the ribs), but if you leave here without ordering the pretzels, you've missed out on a golden opportunity. 

After our meal, we headed over to the spacious game section and did a little boys v. girls cornhole match. It was a great way to burn off our meal. And The Yard is a great place for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"Maybe you want a super fun and activity-filled date night? or maybe you've been partying all day and need to keep moving per Newton's first law. or maybe you just need a place where you and 6-10 friends can easily find a couch, hightop, table, ping pong table, etc. to kick back, catch up, or watch a game.

This is the place.

And while it has a better cornhole set up than Duce, it doesn't have dancing or karaoke to me knowledge so it's 4/5. but hopefully it will someday and then the Yard will truly be \"all things\"."}
{"text":"I haven't been writing reviews lately, but I felt inclined the write this one.

I've loved The Yard since they first opened on 7th street. Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks... good people, good service, and one of the places I always take out of town guests. 

I've been to both locations dozens of times. I've never had a complaint. I would say we are more regularly there for lunch/day drinking than at night, but I've definitely had dinner there as well. On Wednesday night, a group of 9 friends & I went to the Yard for a girls night. We hadn't seen each other in awhile and we were looking forward to seeing each other and catching up. Unfortunately, within 30 minutes of arriving and being sat at our table, the live band started. Now, I understand, this is a restaurant that offers live music. You can't go to a place knowing this and then expect them not to play. However, what is unnecessary, is for them to blast the music throughout the entire venue through the speakers. The Yard is both a restaurant and a bar. People go there for a multitude of reasons. Because of this, it's important to recognize that on a Wednesday night at 7 pm, you have patrons in your restaurant eating a meal.... they are probably going to want to be able to hear each other when they talk. We were sitting in a different room, on the complete opposite side of the restaurant.  I could barely hear the person sitting next to me when they talked, and everyone was yelling to try to speak. I asked our server to turn it down. He reported that his manager did, but we still weren't able to hear each other. 

If The Yard was strictly a bar, I would understand. But it isn't, and especially not at 7 pm on a Wednesday. One of my friends made the comment that The Yard would be a perfect place to take a date when you know you'll have nothing to talk about.... can just blame the lack of conversation on the loud music. 

I still love The Yard, and I'll still return. But I'll probably be hesitant to suggest it for girls night out, and will probably stick to day drinking there instead of dinner."}

AZ Weather, great food, wonderful servers, corn hole, ping pong :-) So happy they brought this to Tempe!

Our server was sweet, accommodating, speedy and made sure we were taken care of.

I'm in love."}
{"text":"Scene is fun.  Most of the food is good, i.e., chopped salad and meat loaf but not capped rib eye (you never see the rib eye). But service is always understaffed at the bar. Shouldn't have to ask three people for salt and pepper before someone gets it. Or a glass of water."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Such a fun place to go for drinks, food, games with friends, family or for a date night. They even have a free photo booth! Food is great quality. I never eat meatloaf but decided to venture outside of my comfort zone and it was really good. Now I order it whenever I go! They also have a great kale salad that's large enough to split. And they're known for their pretzels. 

On wknds they often have live music and on Sundays they offer specials on appetizers (at least during football season). Big fan!"}
{"text":"We come here often, we live in the neighborhood.  Every time we eat here i am very disappointed.  For the price of the item vs the actual item.  I ordered the GARDEN KALE salad for $12 plus $5 more for chicken, it came in the smallest of bowls and had less than an 1oz of chicken on it and 3 pieces of brussel sprouts.  LAME for $18 bucks...  last nite i tried the Green Chili Stew with pork, honestly it had 1 piece of pork in the whole thing..  again for $16 it was so LAME!  when you list the ingredients on the menu the first ingredient SHOULD be the item that is the largest amount in the dish.  
Instead of  
GREEN CHILI STEW* 16 
braised pork shoulder,
northern bean, fried egg,
cornbread

it should read 
Green Chili Stew,
green chili base, beans, egg, cornbread and one piece of pork.  
Rip off for $16.. 

my friend got the prime rib sandwich, OMG for $17 he might have had 2 oz of meat...  Double LAME!

seriously the managers should order menu items randomly throughout the nite to see what is being served.  we may be back but i wont be eating here again, not for the price and what you get.  

Come here for the atmosphere but eat somewhere else..

Shame on you..."}
