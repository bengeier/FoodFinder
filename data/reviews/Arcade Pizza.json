{"text":"Speechless, the garlic and BBQ wings are so good that it make u want to slap the whole family and the dog too. This is the late night service."}
{"text":"There arent enough stars in the world for this place.. I lovvvveee them. Grew up on this place, and they havent skipped a beat since!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service from the delivery person. Waited an hour and a half to find out the driver had issues finding the apartment. The driver then refused to drive back down to deliver the pizza. The establishment was okay with the fact that this driver didn't want to drive back down to make the delivery even though we had been waiting for dinner and offered nothing for this inconvenience."}
{"text":"Best pizza in CLE.  We drive from Lakewood just to pick up a pie.  The crust is a total joy to eat.  It holds up to all the toppings and grease.  We've been eating (and clogging arteries) here for years.  I have yet to find a pizza joint that even comes close an Arcade pizza.  We speak of it often at work and come to find out I'm not the only one who drives such a long distance just for this pizza from heaven.  Staff is great.  Area is sketchy but park out front and you will be fine.  Thank you Arcade for keeping the perfect recipe for all these years!"}
{"text":"I live five minutes away, and they wont deliver to me. And they didnt tell me in a nice way either. Just rude"}
{"text":"I have been going to Arcade ever since they were down the street from the current location. This is my favorite pizza in Cleveland. I will order as I'm driving up from Strongsville to pick it up! Not only the best pizza, but the best prices too. It is a win-win situation."}
{"text":"Yeah they are open late and delivers but the pizza STINKS! After taking 99 hours trying to relay my delivery address (downtown hotel )... what arrived was an over cooked mess. I've had better freezer store bought pizza . It arrived cold and overcooked like rubber . A picture is worth a thousand words so decide for yourself . I definitely will not order from there again!"}
{"text":"FIRST TIME: Tasty neighborhood pizza place in my own backyard that I'm just learning about after being in area for 11 years. Got a medium deluxe for $11.25. First bite was really tasty! Better than Dominos and Pizza Hut. Too bad about the unprofessional treatment I read of others though. Not cool."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland for 2 reasons.  One, the crust is the perfect balance between crispy and chewy. Two, the cheese has enough moisture and the cooks enough patience, to become delightfully browned yet gooey.  This place also delivers till 3am everyday!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating this pizza! Yes, it's greasy but it's also really good. Great tasting toppings and they also have really good sandwiches. And open really late!"}
{"text":"The pizza here deserves 4.5 stars. It's usually very delicious! However because of the service and the quality of my pizza on my last visit I'll only give it one. I've been eating pizza from Arcade since I was a kid. My dad would always pick it up for us and bring it home. Friday was my first time going to Arcade myself and boy was I disappointed. When we got there we stood there for about 5 minutes before someone came to the window. The blonde woman at the window was super rude to the guy in front of us. He said \"15 more minutes? It's already been an hour\" and she replied \"Well how can I make the pizza if I'm standing here talking to you\". Then she said \"Is there any other orders now so I don't have to keep walking back and forth?\". My boyfriend and I told her what we wanted. She rolled her eyes repeatedly as she took it and when he asked what came on a deluxe pizza. When we finished telling her our order she continued to stand behind the glass staring at us and said \"Well hurry up. Is that all?\" when we said yes she took our money and didn't smile or say thank you or anything. She said the pizza would be 30 minutes. We waited about 35 minutes and came back. At that point they told us 15 minutes and once the 15 was up they told us it would be another 10. It took us over an hour to get a large pizza and an order of hot wings. Once we got the pizza home to eat it it was not very good. It definitely needed more sauce which we got from our own kitchen. Once the sauce was added it was much better but not worth the hour wait at all."}
{"text":"Really Gooood cheezy greasy pizza, the dough is perfect the crust is chewy! I wish someone had told me sooner about this place & the PRICE you can't beat it. Lg  Double pepp & Double cheese 9.25$ what I'm hooked. The pictures don't do this place justice, you must taste this pizza to appreciate it.."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this pizza. It's exactly what you're looking for when you want a mom and pop shop type pizza and it's exactly what you're looking for on a light night. It's good pizza.

But a friend and I placed a basic order, waited over an hour for the delivery to find out it's cash only. The driver went to the car to see if he can do anything in the meantime I called back .. they told me they will deliver the pizza we ordered to someone else. Which was a supreme type , so not common. And also over an hour after we ordered. 

I tried calling and explaining that we did not know it was cash only and the person on the phone did not care much, so I will say in turn I didn't return much kindness, so I was hung up on. 

It does deliver late night but it also delivers attitude."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. Great pizza at a very affordable price. Not sure about anything else there besides the garlic bread, which also pretty good, but have never left there unhappy. Is kinda greasy, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery - waited an hour, then called back after not hearing anything. Was told that the order had been placed as pick up (it wasn't). Asked to cancel the order since we didn't want to pick it up, and was rudely told that we were banned from ever ordering again, then hung up on. Called back and very politely tried to explain that it had been their mistake - they immediately started yelling and dropping F-bombs saying there was no way they had made a mistake and they \"do this all F-ing day\" and there was no way they'd made a mistake, then was hung up on again. 

Very disappointing as the pizza itself is good, but not worth being treated so incredibly disrespectfully."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed! Typically Arcade is my #1 pick, but tonight I received a overly cook pizza. Crust so hard it"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I just ordered, received, & took my first bite!  Pizza is amazing. Crust is crunchy & chewy. Cheese is thick & gooey. Flavor is Wow. So happy I'm in the delivery zone. Finally a pizza that's worthy to be called pizza, most of the other pizza joints around here are a joke."}
{"text":"Located in what the manager deems a neighborhood that \"isn't as safe as it used to be,\" Arcade Pizza resembles a Post Office in New York City. That is, you enter one room only to be greeted by thick sheets of plastic window separating the pizza people from the patrons. I ordered ahead and got a large half-sausage, half-mushroom pizza and it took less than 20 minutes to prepare. Parking is adequate on the street out front and there wasn't a line when I went at around 9 p.m. Monday night.

The cost was $10, and they only accept cash, which was inconvenient for me, as I had to drive up the street to the Key Bank in order to withdraw some.

As for the pizza, I've had better, sure, but it's an adequately cheesy and savory distraction from the fast-food of pizza, Pizza Hut and Domino's. If you've had Guy's Pizza, it sort of resembles this, although the crust is more like a cracker in texture. Not that it's crunchy, but sort of thick. Like Lunchables pizza things.

Overall, I'd come here again if I was looking for something delivishly greasy and yet satisfying. The slices are cut like a sheet, even though the pizza's round, which is interesting. I got full on two pieces, but managed to eat four before bed anyway. So eat at your own risk. :P"}
{"text":"What to say about Arcade Pizza.....

This may be the most unhealthy pizza you can buy, but that is exactly why I go there. When the craving for Arcade Pizza hits, it is undeniable and nothing else can assuage my appetite.

The kicker is, it needs to be this bad, yet so good at the same time in order to endure the epic journey that must be embarked upon.

Arcade Pizza is in a rough part of town. There is usually street parking right out front, however a part of me fears for my life on that 20 foot walk from my car to their front door.

Make no mistake about Arcade Pizza. If you have had a rough day and want to hurt yourself by eating a pizza that takes years off your life, this may be the pie for you.
You may also want to get it delivered to avoid the possibility of being stabbed.

In summary, if you are tired of life and want to go out with a bang, may as well head to Arcade Pizza for an adventure and some truly tasty pizza."}
{"text":"I seen a post on Facebook about best pizza in Cleveland and Arcade Pizza was mentioned as a good pizza.
The large 2 topping is priced good, you'll believe you getting a larger pizza from the size of the box;
I opened the box and the pizza was much smaller than the box.
Now to the pizza, overall it wasn't great, I give the pizza a 4, the dough is very thick, toppings are okay amount. Now for the wings; you get 12 for $7.75 which is a fare price for 12; but the wings are very very small.
Wasn't answering the phone for pick up orders, seems like only one person was working, same person taking orders, making pizzas, same person as cashier.
The single staff member was friendly.
Very clean inside.
But I want be returning.
Come with cash because they don't do debit or credit."}
