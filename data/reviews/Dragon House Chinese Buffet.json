{"text":"There is quite a bit of variety at this buffet which is great but the food was just okay. If you're really hungry this place will do but I'm sure there are better buffets in Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was nasty all of it was hard as a rock. It was old and cold.  We got up to leave we didn't even eat then the woman Nicole at the desk still had us pay when I asked to speak to the manager she said the manager was not there after giving me my receipt I asked her her name and she gave it to me then when I asked for the managers name so I could call the next day she just looked at me so I asked again she again staired at me so I said one more time what is the managers name and she said she was the manager so I asked her why she lied to me and she said because I lied to her and wasted her food . So I said that her food was nasty yet again and I then asked for the owners name she refused to give it to me. So I called the other place that I know is a sister store with them and asked them who the owner is they gave me the name raymond. I called the store I just left back and asked if raymond was the owner she knew right away it was me and said why do you know him. I will be calling to talk with the owner about the service I received at his restaurant if that's what they want to call it. Please take it from me DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute worst food... Flat soda. Cups plates and silver wear extremely dirty. Terrible service. Spent $20 for lunch. Time and money I can never get back."}
{"text":"Wasn't really impressed.  We arrived at 9:00 pm, so maybe the food wasn't very fresh because they were closing at 10, but wasn't very impressed.  The place was ok, but nothing special.    The plates were wet at the buffet rack & weren't too clean.  All I can say is that I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"I agree with what I'm seeing in the reviews.  Stopped for lunch yesterday - Sunday afternoon - with my wife.  Price - left $20 that covered two meals and small tip.  Variety - very good variety of items on the buffet.  Food was hot and always full trays.  Grill was a plus.  Plus the stuff tasted good!  Service was excellent.  Pretty busy place.  No wait when we went in.  Took our drink orders - ready when we got back to the table.  Kept them refilled.  Cleared used plates.  All in all - pretty good place.  We'll be back when we are in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"Food has good flavor. But could be warmer.  Eating at 8pm might have something to do with that. Mongolian grill is very good. Although there were fruit flies/knats on the pineapple. Teriyaki chicken (served off the stick) was very tasty. All in all pretty good eats. Just stay away from the pineapple !"}
{"text":"When I say I love crap!, this is exactly what I'm talking about. Keep your French restaurants that leave you hungrier than when you came in. At the The Dragon House Super USA # 1 Chinese Buffet, I am allowed to be the truly disgusting pig that I am. Did I mention I'm cheap? So this place is heaven.  Many stick their noses up at Chinese Buffets, but as long as it tastes good to me, I will stuff my face with stir-fried anything for $11. Give me more of that sweet sweet MSG and cheap meat. I want the diabetis (sic) and the food coma, that is why I'm here. Chinese buffets are temples to my third favorite of the seven deadly sins. The steaming trays of sweet & sour chicken, Mongolian beef, rangoons and lo mein are as the stations of the Cross.  Risking the consequences of delicious, affordable and potentially life-threatening round at The Dragon House is something I'm prepared to take going in. As Anthony Bourdain once said, \"\"If there's not at least a 50% chance of diarrhea when you eat something, it's almost not worth eating.\" I can regret it in the morning, but binge-eating here is one my favorite guilty pleasures."}
{"text":"Didn't like it.  Went with some co-workers for lunch.  Food was just ok and nothing made me want to come back.  Don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"I went for lunch. Not a lot of seafood choices. I don't know if it's dinner. Food is ok for the price."}
{"text":"We found ourselves in this area last night and ate here for the first time.  Dining area looked very clean, there was lots of different varieties of food.  There were people constantly cleaning the buffet areas and taking dirty plates.  As I would expect of a place with so many dishes, the food was ok, but not spectacular.  I enjoyed the general tso chicken and steamed wontons.  My fiance loved the sushi. I was not able to enjoy two of my favorite dishes-dumplings and chinese donuts.  Both had a few very old hard as a rock pieces on the buffet that were not replenished during our visit.  Other dishes did seem to get replenished often, and lots of people came in to get take out while we were there.  Price was good.  The worst part of our visit was when i decided to use the bathroom before leaving.  It was absolutely disgusting!  Trash all over the floor.  The first toilet was unflushed from a previous visitor, the second had what looked like vomit-also unflushed, the third and only clean stall had no toilet paper.  I walked out without using the bathroom.  I am leery of eating anywhere with a gross bathroom.  If I had gone in there before eating, I would not have eaten there."}
{"text":"Good for when you need your Chinese Buffet fix. The soups are really good. The sanitation is scary but I take my chances."}
{"text":"This is the worst expensive Chinese buffet in Charlotte. the food is lukewarm at best and the selection of items is terrible.  Save your money and find a different one. we will not ever return here."}
{"text":"Their carry-out food was great and had it ready within 10 minutes of ordering over the phone."}
{"text":"Been going here since it opened. There were a couple of times that I've been disappointed, but all in all, you can't beat it for the price. My fav is the squid/shrimp on the lunch buffet and I like the fact that (being a major Thai fan) they have the right hot condiments for my insatiable heat requirements. If I'm not doing lunch, then I'm doing take out for dinner. The price can't be beat. My only complaint. No steamed vegetables."}
{"text":"This place definitely satisfied my appetite; the stuffed crab is good and the grilled salmon. I have been to other buffets and this I like in-particular because of the Mongolian grill. I get to choose any meat and vegetables and a sauce and watch as they do their hibachi thing. Although their selection is not as big as the others I have been; the selection is good and the food is even better. My fortune cookie said people are saying good thing about me, but then again so did my wife's? What the odds? HAPPY HIBACHI!!"}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting place I have ever been. My husband and I walked in and walked right out. They have raw chicken, and beef and other stuff at the \"habachi\" station and you actually have to walk into the kitchen and give your plate to the \"chef\" to be cooked. Health violations galore.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Just about the worst food I have ever had.   My buffet expectations are pretty low but always expect to find something half decent.   All of it is tasteless.   10 dollars with tip is 6 dollars more than it's worth."}
{"text":"My new favorite Chinese Buffet. All the food was fresh. Chicken was crunchy and not overly breaded. And the price was great!"}
{"text":"From out of town on business so I gave it a shot. Below average at best. It is an old restaurant in an older part of town. The food was average at best for a buffet, but many of the items had been out for a while (I was there on a Sunday at 1:00 pm). Did the Mongolian grill and was surprised to see the \"chef\" adds the sauce you ask him too (unlike others that let you add a combination of your own choosing).   Overall cleanliness is not good.  As I was eating I started looking around and noticed the windows were filthy, the seat covers on the booths were ripped, and the whole place just needed updating and a very deep cleaning. When I went to checkout, I noticed they had several light switches behind the counter that were labeled with pieces of tape that had yellowed from years of neglect. If it is that way in customer view, how neglected is the kitchen?  I am not from Charlotte, but if I was I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have been here a few times for the lunch buffet.  The selection is really great and the food is fresh.  It has a little of something for everyone.  There's adequate parking and I've never had to wait for a table, even though the place seems to be buzzing at lunchtime.  The service (i.e. drink refills) is prompt.  All things considered, a solid addition to my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting . I took one plate of food and was almost afraid to eat it . Overpriced and nothing was fresh . Would never waste my money here again"}
{"text":"Great, clean buffet with freshly rotating dishes. Nothing sits out too long, because it gets eaten up! You can't go wrong with any of their shrimp dishes, and the dim sum and steamed dumplings are tender. Skip the fried dumplings though -- chewy."}
{"text":"Food is good. Lady at the front desk with attitude bad. She acted like she was doing me a favor by me eating there. When will Charlotte get a restaurant with hand pulled noodles?"}
{"text":"Cheap and good for lunch.  Don't forget to get  a punch card.   Variety is worthwhile. Great location (not far from us). They move quickly to bring out more food. No wating around here for empty pans - letting the food get old and cold. Nope! they get right on it."}
{"text":"good place for lunch sushi better than dragon buffet"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy, if you haven't ordered Take out from this place you are missing out. This is my second time visiting this place."}
{"text":"Good food for $7.50. You can't complain for that price. Imitation baked crab is an excellent choice. Coconut chicken was awesome."}
{"text":"Sure, you can find places in Charlotte that have cook-to-order food along with a buffet (think Chen's Bistro or China One).  Unfortunately those places lack something - usually you can't communicate with the chef, or if you do, the chef mixes your order with someone else's, or you can't add the meat yourself.  Something is always missing.  Not at Dragon House.  Don't get me wrong - this isn't strictly Mongolian BBQ - but it's awfully close.  You get a buffet line dedicated solely to the BBQ line, with a number of veggies and lo mein.  You get chicken, beef, shrimp, (possibly imitation) crab and something that appeared to be a sort of seafood.  You get at least a half-dozen sauces.  Throw whatever you want in a bowl, put it in the queue, and come back a few minutes later and it'll be piping hot, ready for you to eat.  Sweet!  To make things even better, there are three lines of regular buffet fare to keep you busy while you wait, and a fourth line that holds a few sushi items and desserts - even a soft-serve ice cream machine.  The buffet food isn't the best I've had, but it's far from the worst.  You'll find bite-sized appetizers (the dumplings are good) and typical entrees too (the coconut shrimp was my favorite), but it's the BBQ that I enjoyed the most.  Since BD's shut down a few years ago, it's what I've been craving, and now it's back.  If you don't want the pressure, the buffet is quite decent, and the price isn't bad either.  Service is good, but beware that you might see a line at busy times of the day."}
{"text":"I rated this five stars not because it is a five-star restaurant, but a five-star when compared with its genre of Chinese Buffets.  The food was fresh, they offered a grill-to-order Mongolian Grill, and the price was fantastic.  My wife and I visited this restaurant for lunch and were very impressed with the fresh food.  Sometimes when you go to a Chinese buffet it's hit or miss with the freshness of the food.  Here, it was great, even the raw ingredients on the Mongolian Grill.  Yep, that's right, not only did you have the standard Chinese Buffet fare, but you had raw ingredients (beef, shrimp, veggies, noodles) that you assembled as desired into a bowl, handed it to the chef, and minutes later he have you your bowl back with your cooked food.  The buffet even had a generous selection of seafood -- fried shrimp, stufffed shrimp, fried fish, baked fish, crab clusters, fried squid, etc.  It was definitely worth the visit, and with beverages and tax our total was about $13!"}
{"text":"Price and quality on point.  Good variety, service, and cooking.  Edit-please ignore the moron who complained about the \"raw meat at the hibachi.\" That's how hibachis are set up, yhis person is a dummy."}
{"text":"Really can't beat the price. About 8 bucks for all you can eat with hibachi. Food is decent and refilled often. The hibachi has a good selection of meats. Chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, squid, and scallops. None of the other buffet hibachi grills offer scallops. So that's pretty good. There may be a short wait during weekday lunches. Highly recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"Not sure about their buffet but I love to order and pick up and it's always yummy , only Chinese spot close to my job . It's always packed so it must not be bad for the buffet and the workers are always nice and quick"}
{"text":"Okay the food was good the service was cool and the prices was  so over All I will come back."}
{"text":"Service was good and price was right. I ordered a veggie delight cooked in spicy garlic sauce with tofu extra crispy(not on the menu but they said they could make it). To my surprise there was chicken instead of tofu. The server informed me that they did not have tofu and the cook used chicken instead. They made the dish again with a smile. I ask for brown rice which they said they had. It was white rice stir fried with soy sauce. The garlic sauce was kind of gooey(gelatin like) and that is not my style.  I left it alone and ate the majority of my meal.   My wife on the other hand had the buffet. A lot of the hot items were not hot. Judging by what she did not eat after a couple of trips her experience was ok.   What appeared to be locals along with PD seemed to patronize the place. A lot of buffet carry outs.   Personally I would not recommend to my circle. I guess you could say I'm spoiled when it comes to Asian dishes especially vegetable delight in spicy garlic sauce with tofu extra crispy.   *I came here because the reviews were not bad but I should have taken note of one review that mentioned the food had an Asian Latin combo thing going on. My dish missed on the seasoning.   Service was good thus the rating not dipping below 3 and they did try to accommodate me."}
{"text":"Now....let me say, my boyfriend loves this place. I'm indifferent to most Chinese food and have a strong dislike for buffets but every so often, I concede to his request for Chinese buffet.   I was overall, unimpressed with the cleanliness. The sanitation grade was a 90 (they did have hand sanitizer, which I appreciated) and when we were walking toward our booth, an employee was sitting at it and hurriedly got up. No one wiped it or anything.   At the buffet, a kid was picking up cantaloupe with his fingers and putting it back down. Rather than telling him he was being nasty, I made a mental note to not eat anything he went near.   I didn't like the sesame chicken or lo mein. The egg roll had a weird flavor that I couldn't put my finger on. My boyfriend thought it kind of tasted like fish. They had popcorn shrimp that I liked alright and the spring rolls were decent. Their broccoli was also ok. I refused to try the sushi because...well... it's sushi from a buffet.   Overall, I'd be ok if we never had to go back to this place. However, I have a feeling that I will have to compromise on this again in the future. If you don't have someone you love who likes this place, you have absolutely no reason to go here."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Decent location, decent selection, decent price, and it's pretty clean inside - just stay clear of the sushi (awful rice and mostly just filled with krab) and the fried dumplings (as previously noted - chewy beyond belief).   The mongolian bbq is a nice plus, there are lots of chicken and beef dishes (though not the biggest fan of their mongolian beef), soups, steamed options, and veggies. The stuffed crabs were a little heavy on the mayo/creaminess, and the stuffed shrimp lacked flavor, but when it comes to wanting piles of rice, noodles, and fried proteins smothered in sauces - it hits the spot. Service is pretty nonexistent, but they did make it around before my water glass was completely empty.   (I did check on their sanitation score beforehand, since I remembered them being mentioned as one of the areas worst for september - but my main concern, the food not being kept hot enough on the buffet, was addressed - the buffet and most of its contents were definitely steaming!)"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, this is NOT the best Chinese place in town, but this is a great lunch spot on a day when I crave bad Chinese food (bad as in super unhealthy). For $7.29, it's a sizable buffet. My favorite is the hibachi area that's included in the price. They don't skim out at lunch and offer seafood items (squid, bay scallop and shrimp). One dish at the hibachi grill honestly is enough to get your money's worth (Here is my secret to the hibachi: hibachi sauce with a little hot sauce and with garlic).  The sushi on the salad bar are scary looking... so please skip it. Instead, just eat the other goodies. The honorable mentions: hot & sour soup, steamed fish, baked mussels, pan friend dumplings, wings etc. All of them are solid.  I swear everytime I ate there I left with a miserable feeling of overstuffing myself. So consider yourself warned... you may enjoy the meal at the moment, but you will likely hate yourself afterward for making such a bad lunch choice."}
{"text":"I have a problem. I like Chinese buffets. Whenever I travel, I try them. When I'm at home, I sneak away for lunch. (My wife disapproves.)  Dragon House is relatively new, situated in a former Shoney's. Parking is ample and well lit. It's a busy neighborhood and I would recommend being especially aware of your surroundings.  At lunch time, the buffet is fresh and restocked often. The usual chicken dishes are available, from Bourbon to Indian to General Tso and with Broccoli, as well as some beef dishes and broiled salmon. There's even a \"Taco Chicken\" which looks suspiciously like a quesadilla. The salad bar also has a tray of sushi, which I found to be medium fresh (it's the avocado that gives it away). Lo Mein and Fried Rice as well as a couple of soup options as well. All the standard offerings that you can expect.  Don't miss the Mongolian BBQ station, which is decent. Mongolian is like fresh stir fry, pick your own meats, vegetables and sauces and the grill chef prepares it in front of you. It's not the largest selection I've seen but for a Chinese restaurant, impressive.  Cleanliness is adequate. The wait staff is attentive and my waitress brought hot mustard on request. If you're planning on using your laptop, I did find one power outlet in the back, but none anywhere else.  My fortune cookie: Your charming smile is attracting everyone around you."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. If I could give this restaurant less than 1 star I would & I work in the industry. Everything we ate was cold, and get this even the stuff that just came off of the \"hibachi\" grill was cold.. there's no selection, and everything fried is overly greasy. The veggie rolls were cold, and greasy and so was the crab rangoon and sweet and sour chicken. Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service. I asked to speak with a manager and the \"host\" who was sitting at a booth on her phone eating with another girl told us no one spoke English and she couldn't give us our meal for \"free\" so she charged us anyhow even though we had just sat down with our first plate, and decided not to eat because of how gross everything looks.. How does a person that manages and is supposed to give customer service not speak English?! Don't waste your time or money.   Bleeeeeh."}
{"text":"Buffets are tricky places to review. Rarely do they surpass normal restaurants (notable exception: Kyojin http://www.yelp.com/biz/kyojin-buffet-fort-lauderdale#hrid:uaH2ZwoOIbCggX__UNrYTQ) and since the food is in large quantities the quality can take a hit, but if you're eating till you can't feel your legs doesn't that count for something?  This place is a favorite of mine. The servers are on top of things and the food is consistent which is hard for some normal restaurants to accomplish.  Here are a couple of standout dishes:  Indian Chicken - This is actually HOT. I love it when chefs use real spice. Teriyaki Chicken - Sometimes I eat a whole plate of these delicious morsels. Hibachi Station - Surprisingly good for vegetarians. Pile crisp veggies on your plate, add some (fake) crab, and have them sizzle it up with the spicy garlic sauce. Fantastic. Popcorn Shrimp - Lightly battered with a nice bite to them.  What pushes it to 4 stars: A frequent diner's stamp card that will garner you a free meal (lunch and/or dinner) when it's complete.  Also, they have a full menu if you prefer to order takeout from them. I've gone for the Hot & Sour soup alone."}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet, not enough veggies...but green beans are good chicken wings, terry chicken, fried shrimp, Mongolian beef are my favorites.  Always busy"}
