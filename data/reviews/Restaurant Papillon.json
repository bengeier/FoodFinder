{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before we left town. Split the Toscance Pizza and Chicken Club Sandwich. The Small pizza was a large serving, and both meals were delicious! Very friendly and efficient server."}
{"text":"The service wasn't very good at all, and by not at all I mean they never check on you after you order. They forgot half our order and never refilled anything the whole time. We spent over an hour waiting on our food when it wasn't busy outside where we were sitting anyway. The mussels were meh. The wine was meh..The waitress was overheard telling people not to sit and eat which I thought was strange..? I was just dissapointed in this restaruant.."}
{"text":"A guy outside the Restaurant greeted us to have us try the restaurant.  Our girls were wanting pizza so we gave it a try.  We were trying to get to another Italian place on Yelp a block away but the guy was nice enough so we went in.  The place was as described by others.  Nice enough but nothing more elaborate than an olive garden in decorations.  The wait staff was nice enough and spoke English and a little Spanish too.  The bar looked big enough to handle any types of drinks.  Nothing but LeBatt's on tap though.  Visited the bathrooms and they were very clean.  

I ordered one of the specials for lunch ( table d'hote )  which was Rabbit quarters with maple type syrup.  Hey when in Rome.. er French Canada.  The rabbit was great .. 3 legs on top of asparagus and potatoes.  It came with hot tea and butternut squash soup ... which also was great.  (CN$25)

My wife had a club sandwich and fries (CN $10).  

My daughter had a linguini a la gigi which was a good mixture of meats.  (CN $15)

The pizza was not the best and would give it a C-.  By no means a NewYork Style.  Too much spices and too soggy.  But plenty for a medium size.  Pass on this one if you are used to US Pizza.  .

The wait staff was great and offered to take our pictures for us.  He did not mind us having only water to drink .  They get 15% tip included with bill automatically.  But deserved it.  got out of there for $80 for 3 adults 2 children."}
{"text":"The braised beef was excellent, very tender and delicious. The presentation and the sides was also very complimentary. The service was impeccable - we were sitting outside, it started to drizzle a bit, they took us in, and then brought us back out when it got sunny again. Very unpretentious, warm, and friendly service with attention to the details.
Also, the lunch menu consisted of starter and dessert. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon worth $85 for $40 and gave it to a couple of friends to go for dinner. The food was good, the dessert apparently was a disaster but what really shocked me is that they told me that they saw the same exact menu as they were getting for $20. So, indeed, I paid the full $40 that the food is worth and got ripped off on the tip, which is based on the \"full amount\". Another thing: The waitress, who was apparently chewing some gum while serving my friends, ASKED them for $3 more dollars of tip (they have left 10% instead of 15 from the initial amount on the bill).

Boooh never again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was good, but the waiter demanded a higher tip than what i gave. my tip was over 15% and i don't find it professional at all for a waiter to even say anything about a tip."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick stop for a late lunch. We were pleasantly surprised to find a restaurant which was reasonably priced in this tourist area, so I had my reservations about the food. We were very happy with the large pizza we ordered, and had to order a 2nd appetizer of escargot as they were simply outstanding! It was a nice, relaxing stop for us and I'm glad we were able to find a gem in the area.
Our waiter provided us with the best service at any restaurant in our 4 days in Canada.  We've noticed that we don't get the same attention that we expect to receive state side, but are coming to the realization that this is just a cultural difference."}
{"text":"The worst service Ive ever experienced in Montreal restos/eating places.

We sat, the staff saw us, nobody came to offer anything, in the end we had to approach them and ask the menu ourselves.

When we paid the lady in the cashier rudely asked for tip, i mean FORCED us to tip.

If i could I would give 0 star"}
{"text":"Very acccommodating for kids on an early Friday night. Very friendly staff, great service. Food was a little heavy (oil, cheese), but quite tasty."}
{"text":"Ugh...  The very definition of a tourist trap.  Great location...  and that's about it.

Inside, it looks like a Denny's.  Very jarring contrast to Vieux Port outside.

The food is bland - I had a butternut squash soup and the Basque lapin.  Nothing interesting about the soup.  The rabbit looked like a middle schooler's art project - lots of colors, lots of ingredients, all mushed together.  Poor presentation and even poorer taste.

Service was not up to par either, though it was with a smile.  The waitress had a cold and was leaking snot the entire time.  Disturbing...  And compared to other Vieux Port and Plateau restaurants, the service was slow (hard to believe it could be any slower, no??).

Seriously, this is the Denny's of Montreal Vieux Port.  Avoid.  Better to go half a block down to Restaurant de Vieux Port or the other way to Sauvigne."}
{"text":"The food was french and italian. Everything was excellent. My husband ordered coq au vin. The chicken was very moist and tasteful. My son ordered lamb and was very good as well. I ordered chicken roulade stuffed with salmon. It was very moist. All the sauces were very good. Fast and friendly service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"There are many places to choose from in old Montreal. This one is worth it. The mussels with fries in salmon sauce were beyond amazing. Not to mention, our waitress was very considerate in dealing with me, a non-French speaking American."}
{"text":"In a sea of wildly overpriced tourist trap restaurants in Old Montreal, this one manages to serve some reasonably priced Italian food! The menu and the decor is by no means cutting edge stuff or that attractive but both serve their purpose. The table d'hote would give you a lot of bang for you buck with a starter plus coffee or tea, but nothing caught my eye on that separate menu. 

I ordered some linguine with a rose sauce, mushrooms and green onions, substituting chicken for the prosciutto. Our wonderful server loaded me up with fresh grated Parmesan cheese and black pepper. It was a decent meal, the chicken had a bit of a strange texture to it but the sauce was beautiful. I couldn't help mopping up every last drop with the bread basket. 

What really made this place and this experience was our server. I can only hope you are lucky enough to have her too! She did not look down I my substitution, was timely with everything, so sweet, gave us directions and separate bills? No problem! Everyone enjoyed themselves and their meals. Go here for a less pricey, homey bite in this area."}
{"text":"Me and my friend had a great time there. Especially the waiter was so sweet and nice. His name is Oliver, and because the service and food was great, I will definitely go again. I had the seafood pasta and my friend had the braised rabbit. Overall great experiences, recommended!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here one afternoon for a late lunch during our trip to Montreal. This place had wonderful food and drinks, good customer service, and great prices - we were really happy with the full experience!

My girlfriend and I saw our table neighbors order a sangria pitcher, and without any hesitation, decided we had to get that! It looked refreshing and fruity; exactly what we were looking for after the hike we had just taken on Parc Du Mont-Royal. The sangria tasted just as good as it looked - so happy that we made that selection! 

My boyfriend and I were really feeling some pizza and decided to get the La Toscane pie which came with tomatoes, mushrooms, pesto, and of course cheese! Our lovely waitress was kind enough to cut it into halves for us prior to serving. Much appreciated since this relatively thin crust pie was loaded with toppings (cheese being the main one!). It would have been quite a mess had we tried to cut it ourselves! The pizza was delicious. We both agreed that it was even better than we had expected. Highly recommended if you enjoy a good, unique pizza - not just plain cheese!

Service was great. We had two different waitresses, as they switched shifts half way through our meal. Both the ladies were kind and friendly. 

I recommend sitting outside while you grab your food and drinks here so you can enjoy the scenery and some people watching on the cobble stone streets of Old Montreal!"}
{"text":"The food was decent. Nothing amazing. The pizza was a little off and the lasagna sauce was too watery. The location and decor is nice and the price was alright. The service was too slow and the waiter never came to asking us to refill our water or anything. It wasn't busy at all when we went. There was way better restaurants in Old Montreal. I would say avoid this place."}
{"text":"When you're walking down the streets of Old Montreal on a summer Friday night, and find that all terraces but one are packed to the brim, that should raise a red flag (regarding the empty one of course). That was the scene a few weeks ago when 6 of us were looking for a place to eat after watching the awesome Avudo show. Wanting to sit outside, we didn't find any options except for Papillon, so we decided to take our chances. Although service was fine, both food and our sangria were terrible. Across the table, we tried the pizza, soup, pasta in rosé sauce, caesar salad with grilled chicken, and a pitcher of sangria. Needless to say and based on my star rating, everything was terrible. The sangria was so bad that we left a third of it untouched (a rare occurrence when we're together). The pizza was floppy and over-salted while the pasta was overcooked and tasteless. The soup was not seasoned at all, and the dressing of the salad tasted store-bought topped with some very rubber and inedible chicken. 

Overall, terrible food experience!"}
{"text":"The attended was very nice, and the view to the street is great but they are very slower I mean, they took to longer for delivery the order. We waited like 1 hour more to start to eat something."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were exploring Montreal over the weekend.  It was busy and hot in this area of town, so we were looking for a cute place to sit outside and enjoy a snack and a cold beer.

Papillon looked like it fit the bill.  We sat down at the only empty table outside and waited for a server to come over.  We reviewed the menu available on the table and were watching everyone enjoy their drinks and food.  

The table right next to us, a bunch of young guys, were just starting on a pitcher of beer.  The server came outside with fresh drinks for the table in front of us, gave the table their drinks - took one look at us and said they were no longer serving anyone.

We thought we miss understood and said that were more interested in a drink than food, so it was okay if they weren't taking food orders.  She said \"no, we're not going to serve your right now\"

So, yeah - we were rejected service.  Its the first time I ever had that happen to me and everyone looked at us embarrassingly.  We got up and left and noticed another group sat down at our empty table.  I didn't stick around to see if they were served or not.

Honestly, the server took one look at my tattoos and I instantly felt we weren't served because of that.  I have a large tattoo of trees on one arm.  Nothing distasteful, but definitely noticeable.  

Perhaps this place is great, when they decide to serve you.  I'll take my money elsewhere, thanks."}
{"text":"We waited 50 min to food to be served. 
The server was careless, not rude but not pleasant at all. The food was with too much butter and uneatable."}
{"text":"Just don't go to this restaurant.  Reading the reviews, some people seem to have a good experience, but many people, like myself, had a terrible experience.  This place was a complete waste of money and served disgusting food.  Some of the highlights- wilted, brown lettuce, undercooked pizza, tasteless pasta, long waits for food, food coming at different times for our party.  Just don't go."}
{"text":"Ordered lamb for $25, food tasted great. However the lamb was 75% bones and fat... i only had 3 bites of meat.. I informed the waiter about it, and he agreed and spoke with the manager/owner, only to be told to come back to me to inform there is nothing they can do about that. I have never eaten lamb with that much fat and bones in my life. No adjustments were made in anyway. Again food is great. Management is not. The manager didnt even come out to address the issue. It really ruined the rest of our eating experience."}
{"text":"2nd time here in as many years. Love the food both times. Great background music. Upscale food in casual atmosphere. Good service, quick and efficient. 2 adults and 11 year old $118 with a solid tip including wine."}
{"text":"This place in Vieux Montreal can't make up its mind. Is it Italian? French? What is it? Apparently they can't decide either, because they give you two menus; one for the Italian (pizzas, etc) and another for the French. (coc au vin and other staples). Molto strano. Très étrange. We ended up here because we had fancy dining plans for the following night and wanted something more casual, affordable, but still a sit-down meal. We were strolling the street looking at menus and couldn't decide. My wife felt lucky, claiming that the best meal she ever had was an Italian place she chose on impulse years ago so maybe that was a sign? Or maybe it was the greeter who saw us looking through the window and came out to talk up the place. (That should be a negative sign; if it's so good do they really need somebody to drag customers in from the street?)

In any case, we were tired, hungry, ready to end our research and settle into a meal. But soon we began to second-guess our decision. The place was almost empty, while almost all the other nearby places were busy. And the wine selection by the glass was disappointingly limited. But the waiter was so nice, and it was apparent they were trying really hard. The place was cozy enough (except for - horrors - a big-screen tv tuned to the hockey game - thankfully with the sound off). Who knows - maybe against all odds my wife's luck years ago will strike again and this will be the meal of a lifetime? Alas, that was not to be.

I already mentioned the empty dining room and the poor wine selection. Next disappointment was the bread: completely forgettable mini baguettes served with butter.

First we ordered appetizers and salad: french onion soup for me and caesar salad for her. My soup was ok; the broth was not too salty but somehow lacked body. It was filling though, with all that melted cheese on top. My wife's salad was absolutely smothered in heavy caesar dressing even though she had specifically asked them to please go very light on the dressing. She sent it back and they brought a new one with dressing on the side, with no \"attitude\". It was an adequate salad.

For entrees I had quail poached in wine and stuffed with prosciutto/sage stuffing. It was pretty good though not memorable. A generous two small quails served with the wine braising liquid and lots of perfectly cooked vegetables: potatoes (carved into cute little mushroom shapes), carrots, cauliflower (though I felt the cauliflower out of place in this dish). As I said, pretty good, but as I continued to eat I began to find the sage flavor distracting. I like sage, but it just seemed too strong. And the next day, thinking back on the meal, my memories of the sage flavor became perhaps even a bit unpleasant. That just shouldn't happen with a good meal, right?

Wife had some sort of pasta alfredo-like thing with sausage and mushrooms. Pretty good; and even better when her leftovers were reheated for breakfast 2 days later.

But all in all it was a pleasant dining experience, the prices were more than reasonable, and they were so friendly and trying really hard, and, coupled with the nearly empty dining room (even as the time progressed to a more normal dining hour) made me want to root for them and hope that they succeed. So I'll give them a solid 3 stars in spite of their flaws."}
{"text":"Waited over 1 hr for the main course. Waiter kept on telling me 5 minutes. Had to send the steak back because it was very well done when asked for medium and waited another 20 min. Not worth the wait. 2 thumbs down."}
{"text":"Ugh no. The service is very friendly, and the patio ambience is nice, but the food is just below mediocre, and way overpriced for what you get. Also, I ordered a second glass of wine that was delivered a half-hour after I'd ordered it, when I'd finished the meal. I had the rabbit, which was edible but barely."}
{"text":"I concur with MS. The inside is like a Denny's or Applebee's and doesn't fit with Vieux Port. The food was OK. They were open on June 24th, Jean Baptiste day, when a few other places were closed.

I had the Osso Bucco, which was pretty good. The service was reasonable, the price was OK, but just like a Denny's or Steak-n-Shake you pay the cashier on the way out, which was slightly surreal."}
{"text":"Our server met us on the street and the hook was set. He did a great job with recommendations and the service was prompt and extremely friendly. The food was surprisingly good. What we thought was a typical pasta dish ended up being very good. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Having dinner outside on the streets of the old town of Montreal, on a nice summer day, is a mandatory part of Montreal experience (or at least I think so). We found that at Papillon restaurant.

Small but reasonably priced wine list. We had a Rosé which was very dry and refreshing.

Sweet potato and butternut squash soup was not fitting the warm weather, but nevertheless, very tasty.

Escargot, baked with cheese, was excellent, nicely seasoned.

I had an elk stroganoff, which was tasty, but really overcooked. Coq au Vin had an outstanding flavor with great amount of herbs - an outstanding dish.

Excellent friendly service. We also enjoyed a small parade passing by.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to visit Old Montreal City since we both love European style cities and food! We both love traveling and trying out new resturants! We were walking down the cobblestone pathway and decided to go into this resturant for dinner since the price was reasonable and there was street music right across from the place. We ordered rabbit meat and penne papillon which both of them were so delicious! Especially the sauce for the lapin meat was very good. It was sweet but at the same timr very flavorful and made the meat bring out its flavor more. We both enjoyed our meal and the hosts were so kind. It was an amazing place for a dinner and we really enjoyed our dinner. I definitely recommend this resturant if you are visiting Montreal! (Their special menu changes so it might be different from what I had.)"}
{"text":"The pros were good service and a nice view of the cobble stone street of Old Montreal.

Food was ok but overpriced (to be expected for a restaurant in the tourist area). I had the club sandwich. It was served with a green salad with a very nice dressing made from pickled onions - this was my favourite part. However, the turkey and overall sandwich was pretty dry. My dad had the vegetarian omelette which was overcooked. 

I have to imagine there are better options, although everything down here probably costs more than it is worth."}
{"text":"I can't believe what I'm reading in the two star reviews. This place is a real gem. Great food, service, price and location. 

I had Coq au Vin, which was probably the best prepared chicken I've ever had. The manager ordered it after we walked in (my mother stalled for a long time before ordering), so I figured it had to be good. The potato ladkes were delicious. Vegetables perfect. The sauce was amazing and the chicken tender off the bone. Perfect. The buns were crispy and hot, the mediterranean salad was au naturel with olive oil. Very tasty. 

My mother had their Sicilian pizza, which had salmon and scallops on it with mussels still on the shell. She said it was excellent. I didn't try it, I was too stuffed. 

The bill came and it was extremely reasonable. The prices ranged from $12 to $14 each for our meals for huge portions. Service with a smile. 

The front windows of the restaurant look out on beautiful and romantic St-Paul in Old Montreal, facing 18th century architecture. The snow was falling on the cobblestones. 

The only thing I could call attention to would be the decor, which could use a reno, but it was fine. My mother liked it though, so who knows. I disagree with those below who say it looks like an Applebee's or Denny's. It's much more upscale looking than that."}
{"text":"On our venture into Old Montreal we walked upon Restaurant Papillon. We were looking for a patio with a view to people watch! The pizza we ordered was good, we had the seafood pizza, but i thought actually had too much seafood on it. The pitcher of beer was just as tasty. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Avoid it like the plague!  What a terrible place. Bad service. Moody waiter and just bad food. The entrecote tasted old and on the turning point. Uneatable. 
Really bad experience. Not even the french fries were done right."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  My guest and I  ordered the filet mignon.  It was cooked perfectly  (mine was medium rare).  The presentation was tasteful.  The soup that came as part of the Table d'Hôte was simple but tasty.  I have to confess that there were a few specs of dirt (maybe the leak hadn't been rinsed thoroughly?).  That didn't bother me.   The wine selection however is pretty limited.  I would say about 70 wines total.   I will advise that you check your tab thoroughly; they had charged us an extra bottle of wine ($49) and they included the tip  (I would say that is unusual in Montreal for a party of 2)."}
{"text":"Service was slow, food was not very good and there were flies around the tables. Will not go back."}
{"text":"I should have known better than go to this place, all the signs were there, but it was getting late and we were hungry. About 10 minutes after we sat down the people next to us got up and left after having only eaten 1/4 of their salads. I wanted to be safe so I thought a pizza is difficult to mess up too much. After waiting an hour, it finally arrived. It was literally the most repulsive thing I have ever eaten. Cold, soggy, and a mix of sweet covering up a rotten nastiness like I have never tasted and hope to never again in my life. My parents tried and concurred, and their meals did not fair much better. I paid for my salad but told the waitress that I refused to pay for the pizza, at least she didn't ring it up on  the bill. My parents were too polite and paid for theirs. I am writing this two days late and am still sick to my stomach from that pizza. Stay away from this place like the plague. They really had to go out of their way to make it this bad."}
{"text":"The service was great! Everyone in the restaurant was really nice & Sasha our server was fantastic. We had our 1 year old with us and I asked if we could get steamed veggies and she immediately went to the kitchen to make sure they could accommodate. The food was fine. I had a salad, which was exactly what I wanted, plain. My husband had French onion soup, which we enjoyed. The baby had steamed veggies and a roll and was ecstatic. The food is nothing special, but I can't say enough about the service."}
{"text":"If not for the service, I would rate it at 2 stars, as the food just doesn't do it - it's a bit too much of something and not enough of others. 

The value for money is certainly not there, so stay away."}
{"text":"After walking around for a while looking at menus, my husband and I settled on this restaurant. We were able to sit outside in he shade and people watch.

We shared a turkey club sandwich which was a little dry. By the time I realized there was no mayo or sauce on it, I was more than halfway finished with it. It was tasty anyways. 

The service was great! Our waiter, Aladdin, was very nice and polite. We enjoyed talking with him. I would definitely recommend this as a good lunch place with good people watching."}
{"text":"Worst experience  ever had in Montreal. Usually when i come to Montreal i expect great food and amazing restaurants esp in old montreal. This one was an exception.Here is what we ordered..

 . (Pollo pizza)Very average nothing special would prefer pizza pizza over this. Second the server cut in half for us and assumed that we wanted in two separate plates without asking us which made it look very werid. Didnt really taste fresh. 
Four cheese lasagna.. Not fresh, its kind of frustrating how its called four cheese lasagna meanwhile it barely has any cheese on it and all what i tasted was mozzarella cheese. Very blend and plain. Really couldnt even bother finishing lt. Worst dish i had in a while.
Spaghetti.. This is the dish that i would say it wasnt awful. My girlfriend got it and said it was okay. But still wasnt up to my standards.
Now lets get to service.. 
There was only one server handling like the patio that had 4 tables filled with customers. By the time we got there all the other tables have already ate i assume and were just having beer or coffee. So point is the server wasnt that busy. Now once we came in we seated ourselves without her bothering acknowledging us. She came and took our order and she was nice about it. My girlfriend order water with lemon and she served her the water with no lemon and mentioned that she forgot but didnt bother to change it or get another one or even a piece of lemon. Worst part of the service was when we wanted the bill. I asked for it she said she will back within a minute. I have waited exactly 18 minutes for her to come back and she didnt.. She was talking to these two tables and laughing with the customers into deep conversation and forgot about us. I tried to call her multiple times but no answer. I had to go inside the restaurant and chase her and finally paid at the cash register. Prices are pretty high. Had to pay service fee for a bad a service. That just shows how insecure they are about their food and service that they wont be getting tips. 

Also a cherry on top there was dead flies on my tables that are clear in the pictures i posted.

Overall it was just a bad restaurant or a bad day for them."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon for some sangria and appetizers. The sangria was great, the mussels and fries were amaaaaaazing (well the mussels were anyway, we did the Dijonnaise sauce). The fries were kind of your typical bland, cookie-cutter frozen fries and came with a packet of ketchup and a packet of mayo-- not what I'd call fancy. Would be better if they came with some kind of garlic aioli sauce or something, or at least an actual bottle of ketchup. It would also have been nice if they had real dishes, pretty much everything except the silverware was plastic. We still had a great time though, and the service was very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a nice lunch while in Old Montreal.

The place didn't have too many people in it, we were seated very quickly and the waitress was extremely nice and attentive.

I had a club sandwich and fries.  The sandwich was so good!  The bread was nice and toasted, the veggies were very fresh and the chicken and bacon were wonderful."}
{"text":"The meal was OK, but in this city, you shouldn't have to settle for OK.  The Bruscetta was pretty good, though."}
{"text":"Great small restaurant! Had a late lunch here with lobster ravioli and rose wine. The service was quick and so nice. The food came out right away with bread. The sidewalk tables were pleasant with constant traffic walking by for good people watching. I would recommend this place if you're in the mood for Italian."}
{"text":"Mussels with classic sauce were great.  We also enjoyed seafood pizza, loaded with a variety of fresh seafood.  We sat outside, and we were packed in with lots of people.  But it was expected because it was such a nice day. If you have to eat around old Montréal area, this is not a bad choice."}
{"text":"The snails were amazing. I had bread, butter, and snails and made a sandwich.. The ceaser salad and blt  weren't very good. The waiter was nice and very attentive. I had a descent experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"horribly disorganized. Childrens pasta was less than an Infants portion so our daughter walked away hungry. Good food but nothing came out as requested and several mistakes on the order. Lackadaisical service because the area is flooded with tourists. When will the local tourist authority take these comments seriously and hold the local establishments accountable for shoddy service. Collectively these tourist traps left us wondering if anywhere in the area was worth eating at"}
{"text":"We ordered the escargots au gratin, which were pretty good, but the pasta, lasagna and pizza were awful, they had too much raw tomato taste, the lasagna tasted like those frozen ones you buy at the grocery store (not good at all) and the pizza also looked like a mini frozen pizza with black-burnt edges and 3 strips of fresh peppers added to it. We felt sick after and it was only made worse when we got the expensive bill and were reminded that we didn't just have to regret eating the food but now we had to pay a pricy bill. I would NOT recommend eating here unless you just want to try the escargots. I almost wish that I had had the nerve to tell them that we didn't like it and return the food instead of politely eating it."}
{"text":"Good service. Our waiter Alexander was very friendly and super attentive. We were being very difficult with special requests because some of us are vegetarians and he took it in stride and joked around with us. The food was pretty good, pretty much what we expected. My friend loved her lobster ravioli and my wife really enjoyed the lasagna with meat sauce. The vegetarian pasta was more average and needed more salt. But the service was so good that I would come back the next time I visit old Montreal."}
{"text":"I was very much less than impressed with their food in relation to the price that I paid for it.  The staff was decent.

I hope they make some changes on the food quality because they have a nice looking restaurant and have a fine location in Vieux-Montreal."}
{"text":"Checked out many excellent menus on Rue St Paul, not ready for more steak or a formal French $$$ place. This was even better than we hoped. Most artful Greek salad a tower of fresh crisp ingredients. They have a goidcitaluan menu, but we opted forvthe local French menu, a fish doree, and a roulade of pork loin around 2 kinds of berries."}
{"text":"Coq au vin big enough to feed me and the guy outside. Fresh baked bread. Huge beautiful salad and very nice service. We had a great dinner here for half the price of other restaurants on the same street. Payment process was at the bar, kinda weird... But c'est la vie I guess.
Oh - the location is right in the center of everything in old town Montreal, steps from the Piano Rouge Jazz bar, and just around the corner from the Notre Dame Basilica.
If you're trying to save some sous, the food here is the right price and well done."}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch with my husband. Service was great but food was mediocre and overpriced. Just a typical tourist trap restaurant in Old Montreal."}
{"text":"Great location. Food was good. Server was fantastic."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with great food. The servers were nice and very accommodating to our party. We had a small dog who is well behaved and doesn't shed and they gave us a corner seat so she could sit in the window sill. Food was delicious, I had the fettuccini a la gigi and finished the whole thing! The garlic bread with cheese was also yummy... Literally melted in my mouth! So happy we found this place! Definitely check out if you're visiting like me!"}
{"text":"I would give this 10 stars if I can.

One of the many restaurants in Old Montreal but the boyfriend and I chose this place because they had escargot. We ended coming to this place a second time right before we left Montreal (that's how much we loved it).

An elegant restuarant that gave a romantic ambiance wasn't so filled with patrons. We knew what we wanted, so we ordered endless plates of escargot and even mussels. The escargot with butter and cheese tasted extreme, I couldn't believe something that is so easy can be so wonderful. We even took the bread and soak up the butter and juices. The mussels were great also, the blue cheese sauce was unforgettable.

Our second visit consist of a more normal meal than just endless orders of escargot, although we did order some. We had the braised rabbit and salmon. Braised rabbit was nicely done with the meat coming right off the bone. Tender and succulent which was more than what we expected. The salmon was cooked perfectly, very moist and flaky. The vegetables that came with the dish was actually sauteed, not just steamed but sauteed with salt and pepper.

One of the places that we will definitely re-visit whenever we get the chance to be in Montreal again. Price was reasonable and service was impeccable."}
{"text":"We had the chef specials on a beautiful Montreal Sunday night. I had the rabbit shoulder confit glazed in maple sauce with pine nuts, wife had elk stew in paprika and other herbs with yogurt to go with.

Overall we did like the entrees. Meat is tender and tasty. The yogurt does blend well with elk giving it a bit of that Mansaf feel. Only knock is it's a bit on salty side. Coffee is a bit off."}
{"text":"Amazing.  It is in Old Montreal.  It was open Jan 1st when everything else was closed.  The waitress was sweet and friendly, even to the loud spoiled iPhone addict US tourists at the next table.  The wine was good, even the house wine.  The cuisine is French and Italian I think.  The escagot were almost without taste, did not care for them.  However, my duck breast (prepared medium rare) and my boyfriend's sirloin were perfect.  Delicious sides, delicious meat and a great atmosphere -- a touch of old romance with great ambiance.  I absolutely felt great in this restaurant, I remember it fondly and I think it will always stick out in my memory."}
{"text":"So sorry to pull down the ratings. But, 2 stars are all we feel like giving.  They do have nice and friendly staff but their menu (and decor) were a bit tacky. They are so lacking in creativity!

We got the lunch special that includes soup or salad and coffee or tea.  My husband got the roasted duck in exotic sauce and I ordered apple-cranberry roasted rabbit. I found my order to be okay but my husband's duck was tough and we both didn't like whatever sauce it had. We felt duped for thinking it was a restaurant with a unique style.  

The only consolation for ending up in a place like this was the fact that they genuinely welcomed our little ones- they allowed us to wheel in our double stroller and park it into a corner. And, though not mentioned in their menu books, they could make a \"bambino\" sized pizza or pasta dish.

{Oh, congratulations to me for my 100th entry!!!}"}
{"text":"My best friend was visiting me in Montreal and we were walking the streets of Vieux-Port trying to find something for dinner. The hostess saw us looking at the menu and approached us, she told us about the nightly menu etc etc and we decided to try it. We had originally decided to get a plate of mussels and a pizza but we were so amazed by the mussels (they were some of the best we'd ever had) that we requested to cancel the pizza and get another plate of mussels. They also came with complimentary bread and potatoes which were delicious! The staff was accommodating and kind, and the hostess was very helpful and friendly. It was one of the best dining experiences ever. 10/10 recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Terrible. Worst meal I had in Montreal. Awful atmosphere, weak drinks uninspiring food"}
{"text":"Tables were crowded, unkept and unorganized in the front patio. Was seated immediately by the staff. Given water menus and then told he'd return to take our drinks order. In return of our order we received luke warm beer from the taps (goose brand beer) and a slightly cool shock top. We were a bit disappointed after looking forward to a nice cold drink after a six hour drive! Anyway it's all good, we just arrived and on the bright side had a seat and a drink to enjoy at least! 

Moving on to the food order; we tried to go for the mussels and fries, but no more fries. I changed to the caeser club sandwich and my partner ordered the vegetarian omelet. We were able to order two more beers before the food arrived, which was fine. I overheard the two cooks in a panicked ruckus as I walked past the towards the restroom. I returned to my seat in hopes of food - soon! Two cold small hot dog bun sized peices of bread were served with warm split butter packets. Eh, bread and butter is always a nice accompaniment to any meal. 

The food arrives. I look down at it with a frown. The caeser salad was rough cut romaine leaves lightly dressed with some caeser(?) dressing and plain croutons. The club sandwich was cold chicken, two strips of bacon, lettuce, blablabla. I look over at my partners Greek salad which is a cucumber salad in essence with some kind of black olive dressing. Slightly sweet and herby dressing , whatever. Her omelet was the next and last thing I have to mention. What a disaster. A brown crust was evident that the eggs were left too long to cook in the pan, must have forgot about it. And then the runny mess of raw eggs and half cooked bell peppers became so in your face after they decided enough was enough and hastily scraped in onto the plate. It was served was some asparagus, pretty nice actually, roast potatoes carved into the shape of a mushroom (kind of?). 

We asked for the bill and left enough cash for it and tips, were told while stepping off the patio that we were instructed to \"always pay inside\". I had to laugh it off and not react to his condescending instructions. Watched him run over to check the bill with a worried face before a sigh of relief swept over his overworked and desperate face. 

We made enough jokes about our experience afterwards and just shook it off. Montreal surely has more to offer than this."}
{"text":"We stopped here after doing the f having a good meal. The decor tourist thing in the old city. Upon entering I had no expectation of having a good meal. The devour is chain restaurant standard but the food was very good. At the waiter's suggestion I had the Linguini Fruits due Made. The presentation was nicely done with 3 colossal shrimp on top with sprigs of parsley beneath which was the linguini in a light cream sauce chock full of rock shrimp and busy scallops in a bowl surrounded by a dozen mussels. Amazingly none of the ingredients were over cooked and all was delicious. My wife had the Coq au Vin and said it was excellent also. Very surprising and I recomend the place ."}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews but this food was so bad. Everything tasted frozen and just plain gross. Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"We arrived in Montreal in the midst of a deluge, which showed no signs of relenting. I was in the mood for Middle Eastern food, but Yelp was wrong 3 times in a row about where the falafel restaurants were (come on, guys!) so we wandered until we found this place and came in, sopping wet, to recover and have a very late dinner.

The interior is a little odd: it seems like it used to be a Bob's Big Boy kind of place, though it's been dressed up a little with (fake) floral arrangements and wall art. I wished it had stuck to the classic French cafe look, which is much more pleasing to me -- I can see fake American anywhere!

The mussels were the reason we'd chosen this place (plus, honestly, not many places were still serving at 9 PM on Friday) so I ordered the classic style with wine, garlic and herbs. They were okay: not overcooked, but not very flavorful either. The bread was just average, not a classic baguette. Greek salad was also decent, though the dressing was more Italian than Greek. The best thing we ordered was the roasted red pepper soup, which was more mellow and sweet than I'd expected and drizzled with (I think) basil oil.

Not a bad place to eat, but if it hadn't been late and pouring, I would have preferred somewhere else for my first Old Montreal dining experience."}
{"text":"Food was great! But the service is a bit slow. We're 8 and it took time to serve the bread and soup.  Then, we asked for additional bread and they said that they're out of it but we see other servers still serving bread! Just awful service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza bearing little relationship to Pizza Hut. Fresh and artisan products, lovely thin crust, richly season home-made sauce, mixture of artisan cheeses. Never had anything like it before. If we ever return to Montreal, it will certainly include a vist to Papillon."}
{"text":"We got great service the night we went. The Soupe de Jour was squash and that was excellent. The pizza was ok. Great for the area though."}
{"text":"We went as a group of 5 and we were in rather a rush, but the service was rally slow, it took about 30min to get a table... There were a few empty tables for 4 and 2, but instead of combining them, they made us wait for the table for 6. The people at the table were done and were just sitting and chatting, the waiters did nothing to hurry up the situation... We decided that we would determine what we wanted as we stood there waiting, when we finally for a table and ordered, the food took a while to get to us. Among us we got 2 penne win sundried tomatoes and Italian sausage, one Sicilian pizza, a linguini carbanara and chicken in wine sauce with came with Greek salad. The salad was tiny and the veggies were drenched in oil. The pizza and chicken were both well done and the chicken dish came in large portions and the meat was rather tender. The carbanara serving was small, but good in taste, the 2 penne were good, the sauce was sweet but one thing that was odd is the fact that the 2 penne dishes looked really different ( one was tomato red and the other was more a rose sauce) although the fast was rather similar... The service was pretty bad, the food was served and they forgot to ask of we wanted cheese or pepper...

Overall, the food is still decent (although it's pricey) but the service was terrible..."}
{"text":"I am utterly shocked at how this place remains open in such a prime location. Friends and I drove to Montreal from Toronto for the weekend and for lunch we were walking around old Montreal debating on where to go. As we read the outside menu the owner (I assume) runs out to tell us the specials and then asks us how many will be dining. She was extremely aggressive however we walked all over and were frustrated so we settled. BAD DECISION. As we walked in the decor was so outdated and very Swiss Chalet-esque. The food was so poor in taste and quality. I had a chicken club and French onion Soup. The French Onion Soup was so flavourless and lacked any seasoning and the sandwich was god awful. The chicken was hard as a rock and ice cold. They obviously had pulled it out the fridge from over night otherwise there is no explanation for that temperature. We also asked for a basket of bread which looked like 3 buns from costco... again ice cold. They couldn't even be bothered to throw them in the oven for 3 minutes. I really am not a picky customer and I am an extremely generous tipper at the worst of times but the food was so atrocious. 

PLUS SIDE: Our waiter was lovely and gave us great suggestions for going out."}
