{"text":"This place is one of the worst bbq places to go.  Would recommend Swiss Chalet before going to this hole.  Terrible food.  Terrible service.  You call to see if they are open and the guy answers saying maybe they will be open as they close early if it's dead.  Would not go back.  Do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends. Very social and well priced. I've gone twice now and look forward to going back. Great drinks at a great price."}
{"text":"This place is a great find and going to become a Calgary Icon. The food is great! Portions are decent and are a great value. The service is excellent and that's during the dinner rush at a table of 12. Our server Jessica never let a drink run out and she had plenty of help to keep us well fed and watered. The pork ribs were amazing, not the best in the city, but in the top 5 for sure! They serve local craft beer and have a lot of house made cocktails, and for once in this city you can afford to have them! If you're feeling a little restless, you can get up and play darts or foosball! This place is great to relax in!"}
