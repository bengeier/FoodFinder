{"text":"Food was decent, smaller portions which is GOOD, friendly service. Not the cleanest but a decent meal with good prices. It would get 4 stars if the food had just a little more flavor."}
{"text":"I ate at Jenny's diner for breakfast, lunch and supper.  First of all, I ate a breakfast burrito, the potatoes inside was stale and old and hard, I also ate the biscuits and gravy which tasted horrible, I also had meatloaf which was like biting into slime and grease, I tried the fish and shrimp, that too was disgusting, the fish was too small and tatsted as if it was in the freezer for a very long time, the diner itself is very dirty, the dust falls off the ceiling fan and onto your food and the dirt is on the walls, ceilings and the crevices of the walls and woodwork, if you like sewer roaches this plce is loaded with them, it has tons of roaches which crwl out everywhere wnd climb up your pant leg while you eat, the bathrooms have no toilet paper and are always filthy and smell, the toilets are never clean.  the only good thing about this place is the beautiful blonde brazilian waitress, who is very sweet and a bombshell and has an excellent personality and is the best waitress there."}
{"text":"I have patronized this business twice now and it's such a quaint, cute diner. The food is okay, comparable to Denny's. I got the same waitress both times, Brandi, who is just the nicest woman ever! Their food is very affordable. They offer a breakfast buffet on Sat and Sundays for $6.99, all you can eat. I know it looks like a slum from the outside, but go in and give it a try! And ask for Brandi because she's a sweetheart."}
