{"text":"I went here once about a year ago with some friends for sushi.  The ambiance inside the restaurant felt very cold.  This aside, I typically save my judgement for the food.  The food was equally as bad as the environment.

I've eaten here twice, once I had delivery at a friends house and the other time we ate at the restaurant.  For delivery I got the chicken teriyaki bento box which was bland and the chicken was fatty.  When we ate at the restaurant we ordered sushi which was very mediocre and now worth going back for.

If you're looking for decent sushi in this area I strongly recommend you try Markham Sushi, it's fresh, clean and the atmosphere is better."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Menu is limited in terms of what you can order for lunch. There isnt alot of dining space and the place probably needs to be renovated."}
{"text":"All you can eat Japanese. We decided go order from the menu instead of the all you can eat buffet. Worst service ever. 
10 tables 4 were occupied including our party of four. 

It took 40 minutes for our order to come and it didn't all come at the same time. Only one of the orders came. Which left the other 3 staring at walls. 

The other orders came within the next 15 minutes one at a time 10 minutes apart. 

Our appetizers came after two of my friends finished their lunch. One of my friend cancelled his order because he ate our left over food.

I've been here a few times in the past and the service was always poor. I go here because my sons school is near by. But today was the worst ever."}
{"text":"FOOD
- This is pretty much a last resort place for sushi because they're open late (until 10pm).

- The sushi and sashimi are mediocre at best, average fish quality, and the rolls are very messily rolled.

- In terms of hot foods, their chapche is pretty tasty and you get a large portion. Moreover, their beef ribs are nicely seasoned and tender.

SERVICE
- There's only 1 server. Depending on who you get, it can be the male server in his 30s who speaks English and actually interacts with you but is kind of rude, or the female in her 30s who does not speak and throws the food on the table.

- This one time I went in for take-out, one of the 2 sushi chefs was simultaneously playing a game on his iPad and rolling sushi. A little unhygienic, don't you think? Maybe that's why it takes so long to get my food!

ATMOSPHERE/MISC
- Nothing really special, kind of bland, actually. It's a pretty small sized place.

- I go here for AYCE lunch because it's cheap, only $13.99"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite place to go for sushi. I used to live 5 minutes away and went all the time, but will still frequently make the 25 minute drive for Daisuki now that I've moved.  

Salmon sashimi is the best I've had; so buttery and sliced perfectly. White tuna is also nice and fatty, not watery like a lot of places. Both very melt in your mouth, shocking for an AYCE place.

Hand rolls are packed full of goodies, not overloaded with rice. My boyfriend and I swear by the spicy salmon and crunchy salmon hand rolls. 

Gyoza are crunchy and deep fried, with nicely balanced flavours. Beef kalbi is very succulent. Agedashi tofu is delicate and mild. 

The service has always been excellent from day one, but it is also nice that they seem to recognize us when we walk in the door now. Everyone is full of smiles, very fast and courteous. Even when we interrupt their dinner at 4:30pm (sorry)! Food is well timed for delivery; no long waits or too much all at once.

Decor is recently updated; perfectly suited to the style of meal. Classy looking, without being pretentious. Very inviting."}
{"text":"Im pretty excited cuz I just got my yelp account today and this bibimbap I ordered last year came to mind. I came in on my one hour lunch break and a young man took the order. After 15 minutes of waiting he mentions that it should be out soon (i assume they were cutting and chopping all the veggies) He then stepped out of the restaurant and disappeared for another 10 minutes. He came back with a bag from garden basket and i could see a carton of eggs, some greens and a few other veggies. By this time, i started to feel malnourished...and by the time my food came out there was only 15 mins left of my lunch break to eat. On top of that, my bibimbap only had carrots, zucchini and the egg. 
Where the mushrooms at? Where dem beef at!??!?"}
{"text":"Very slow service but overall good food - salmon sashimi is very fresh and nicely presented in the form of a flower. Comparatively cheaper AYCE and place is very low key - looks more like a diner than an AYCE sushi restaurant. Waiters are polite but way understaffed - only 1 waiter, 1 person making sushi and 1 person in the kitchen. Food takes a long time to arrive and service is super slow, you will be better off helping yourself rather than waiting for them to wipe the table or to get you the menu (for 2nd order). While placing an order on paper, be prepared that they will miss some items but if you order directly with the waiter, he will bring your items right away. Menu is not too extensive but overall enough kitchen selection."}
{"text":"Just ordered a Maki Tray from here and was the highlight of my party! Everyone loved it! The rolls here are by far the best with very little rice, not like other AYCE restaurants. This restaurant is definitely worth trying! Eat-in may take longer than others but you just need to remember this is not a fast food restaurant! Must try if you're in the neighbourhood! 

Just came back here again for take out of a platter and it was the hit for the party! Called in and told them I'd pick it up at 5:30 and by 5:40 I got a call asking where I was as the platter was ready! Great food and fast service! Will definitely order a platter for all my parties!"}
{"text":"Decently priced and we didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive. They need to improve on their boring decor and the service. There was only one waiter there and he wasn't as attentive as he could have been...they should seriously hire more people to wait the tables. The food was good and warm, only the sashimi was kind of small.   I would recommend it to those that just want their sushi fix, but if you are going out for a date and trying to make an impression this would not be the place."}
{"text":"This place deserves a half star,mainly for the service. Since it's in the neighborhood we gave it a few chances but everytime the service has been mediocre at the best. Today, I placed a take out order over the phone. 30 mins later, when I reach the restaurant to pick up the \"order\" all I'm greeted is with blank stares! The \"order\" is sitting on the counter, it never reached the kitchen!!! When asked how long the will it take to get the food ready, all I get is 20 mins, no apology nothing. Exasperated I ask her to cancel the order, and once again I'm met with a blank stare. Not once did she apologize for her mistake,  in stead she went about her way as if nothing happened. Will never go back to this awful service! Absolutely disgraceful!"}
{"text":"horrible! the manager called my table son of bitches! and they charged us $4+ higher!  cuz we have 6 people with us and ordered food. 

they get so snubby on us, when we ordered more food.. isn't that the purpose of all you can eat? we just wanted a 2nd round and they get so mad 

i'm so psst , i just finished today and you know what. im not going back there ever again..  

the manager gave me an attitude and the food never came out. horrible horrible horrible!

don't waste your money here. zero customer service!

never ever going back again!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Very well priced especially according to the size and taste. The spicy salmon roll($5.50) and spicy tuna roll($5.50) are incredible and cheap!! I go very often and the quality never fluctuates.  All their appetizers are as good as it gets.. the miso soup, their tempura etc.. they offer 10% discount with cash payments. 

The staff is vey accommodating and they're typically pretty fast with taking your order and bringing your food out. Decor is kind of plain but oh well..

I recommend this place and I will be definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place. I know the menu inside and out so I know just what to order and what's good. Limited selection compared to other sushi places but what they have is good. Price is reasonable, service is okay, setting is casual."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by their hours. They say they're open until 10pm on Monday nights but when we showed up at 8:50 they said they would only do take out. This used to be my go to sushi place but with service as bad as this, I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Bad food
Bad service
Lunch ends at 3 and we got there at 2:40 and they refused to serve us lunch saying it was last call?? If the last call is before 3 why say lunch ends at 3. The sushi quality was bad aswell. They put too much rice to get you full faster and they put an automatic 10% tip. 
Terrible and never coming back"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  We usually have AYCE dinner and it has never disappointed.  Try spicy salmon roll, dragon roll, black dragon roll, sweet potatoe tempura, kalbi ribs, eel sushi.  Yes, the salmon sashimi is thinly sliced but since it's AYCE, it doesn't matter to me.  Rolls are nicely sized and not too much rice.  Nice balance.  You must try this place.  Great value.  

As a side I also like that it's a group of young adults running the place.  I love that people can be young and have the courage to employ themselves and run a business.  I wouldn't do it myself so bravo to them for managing it on their own.   

Note: sashimi is only available for the dinner AYCE."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch yesterday and though there was no line up, there was a dining room full of people.  The food was excellent. The sushi is fresh and the selection of rolls was extensive.  For the lunch price of $11.99 it is well worth it.  I would recommend trying this restaurant when you aren't in a hurry to get anywhere as the service was slow.  This was expected as the number of tables that kept coming in were overwhelming the small number of staff on hand.  Despite the slow service, the staff were helpful and friendly.

As another reviewer has said, the selection is not as extensive as Yang's menu, but the quality of the food will bring me back."}
{"text":"An AYCE sushi in east Markham? Seems too good to be true. 

Unfortunately, it is. The food here failed to meet my already low expectations. The sushi rice was mushy and over cooked, sashimi was still partially frozen and cut in to odd shapes (I'm sure they were the end pieces that usually get turned into rolls), tempura was over battered, dense, and soggy. 

Considering they are charging about the same as other (significantly better) AYCE sushi places, I was very disappointed. 

Menu selection is a little odd, they have a large selection of rolls but a poor selection of everything else. So good if you like rolls, bad if you like everything else. 

I wish I had better things to say about the food, I want this place to do well as it is close to home. The waiter was amazingly friendly and personable. I love supporting small local businesses. But unfortunately this is one I cannot get behind."}
{"text":"Terrible service... make sure you double check the menu and prices as I was surprised to know that what I ordered from the menu was now going to cost me more as the server brought over a \"revised rate\"menu... worst of all she told me this when she served the dish,  when I questioned why she didnt tell me this before,  she picked up the dish to take it back when we have been sitting there for 10 mins waiting for our food... 


The lack of service is enough for me to never return back.... After all its markham,  there are 100+ sushi bars..."}
{"text":"Daisuki is an awesome place to eat when you are out for a casual time with friends.

It is very non descript, and there are usually no more than 3 staff at any time, but the food is fresh and awesome.

I always get the AYCE. It's a deal for $12 for lunch! Unlike the other AYCE places i have been to in Markham, they do NOT overload the rice on the Maki -- its protien first here!

Never had a bad meal, the staff is super friendly, and even my kids love it here!"}
{"text":"Very good , we love coming here I just wish the rice on the Maki rolls wasn't so overpowering . Cut down some rice and it's a 5 star ."}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap and quick bite of sushi?  Look somewhere else.  They attracted me in with their aggressive lunch AYCE buffet price ($12.99!) and they had a large selection of maki and unagi rolls.  I ordered 5 standard rolls and the first two (spicy salmon, BBQ eel) was nothing special.  I'd review the other 3 but they never came.  After waiting 40 min I asked about the status of my other rolls when the waiter told me that they ran out of fish.  WTF.  And to be clear, it's a small restaurant and there were only 2 diners.  I also frequent many Asian restaurants so I am accustomed to \"Asian level\" service.  This was a new low.

So, average food with low turn over (I would not be surprised if food poisoning visits me tonight) coupled with clueless service has me giving this place a low score.  You want quick and cheap sushi?  Try a grocery store like Loblaws or T&T ... it'll probably be quicker and fresher too."}
{"text":"I some times get take-out from here as I live near by. Sushi is average. Never ate in the restaurant, very plain plain atmosphere. In a strip mall."}
{"text":"My new favourite sushi joint, no other sushi restaurant can compare anymore. 

MUST try the spicy salmon roll!!
Also their ginger is fresh, and juicier than any other sushi restaurant I've been too. Service is good and the food comes out pretty quickly. 

The prices are pretty cheap, lunch buffet through out the week is $14"}
{"text":"Omg I've never seen so little fish in a handroll. I ordered a spicy salmon handroll and probably had a 1x1x1cm piece of salmon surrounded by 1lb of rice and tempura."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery took a hour and a half to get here and I'm 10 mins away.they put my salad with my hot food and it git nasty and soggy.  The sashimi was tiny portions fir what I paid. Also driver had no change. I won't go back :-( markham sushi rocks! Wish they delivered."}
{"text":"Really good. I had the lunch special - dynamite sushi and Tempura Shrimp/Veggies so yummy. Definitely going back with friends or by myself!"}
{"text":"I came on a weeknight and it was pretty empty. In spite of that they were able to forget a lot of our orders and slow at coming out.

I feel like they are focused on takeout more since there were a lot of delivery guys coming in and out. 

Food quality is mediocre at best. And they should really invest in better blinds so that the sun isn't shining directly into the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the cheaper AYCE sushi places in markham. They offer both AYCE and a la carte options. Servers were polite and nice. 

AYCE menu was decent, rolls were good and sashimi was surprisingly quite fresh. Their lunch and dinner prices were the same on weekdays and weekends whereas most places charge a few dollars more on weekends. Lunch $12.99 and dinner $19.99."}
{"text":"I got the spicy crab roll and seaweed salad. I thought that everything was decent for the price but some of the rolls fell apart easily. Waitress was also very nice"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bibimbap.  Server gave me a red bottle which I thought was the red sauce.  It came out a strange yellow.  I thought that was odd, thinking he must have given me mayo or something.  Hoping that my food wasn't ruined, I tasted it to see if it could be salvaged. Turns out it wasn't food, let alone mayo, it was DISHWASHING DETERGENT.

Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"The Sushi Is by no means exceptional, but I've been going her since I was a teenager and I love it! It's all-you-can-eat at a great price, especially at lunchtime during the week, and their noodle dishes are especially good!"}
{"text":"With a $13.99 price point, it is hard to resist, BUT YOU MUST!

The sushi is jam packed with rice with barely any filling/topping. The ratio of rice to filling is way off and as a result, the sushi experience is just not good. Selection is also very small aside from the terrible sushi.

As a lover of cheap food and sushi, I regret to say that this is just not worth a visit."}
{"text":"They were renovating the exterior of the plaza so it was very difficult to find the restaurant. Food was great but the service was terrible! There was only one server working and he was nowhere tone seen when we needed something.. Didn't get tea when we sat down, didn't take our order, didn't get utensils when our food came out and when asked. Had to go up to the counter and ask the sushi chef but he didn't pass the message along..."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat place, the price is great however... They don't give you the number of pcs you ask for. You ask for 10 pcs of shrimp tempura, they give you 5. Waiter seems bothered if you keep asking for more food. I still had some pending orders but i just asked for the bill cuz i wasn't sure if the food was even coming. So yeah... The price is great, food taste decent but I doubt I'll ever come back here again or even recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"No such thing as service at this place. 
When you first walk in, they do not even give you anything to drink until you ask (which can take forever for them to come).
Always only one person working and they are in the kitchen 90% of the time. Frustrating, if you want to dine for 5 hours, this is the place. The food is not good as well as the sushi feels warm and not fresh"}
{"text":"don't like being necessarily negative, as it doesn't help anyone who is looking for honest feedback for a place they may want to try. Having said that, I find it almost a requirement to warn you before going here as it is a terrible experience all the way through as you get what you pay for. 

Atmosphere:

This is a hole in the wall place that reminds of you visiting your friend as a kid who had parents with bad taste in decor. It was very plain, dull, and terrible. Doesn't make you feel safe for what you're going to eat. The one waitress sits there on her phone texting and watching videos, the guy who prepares the food isn't in any chefs gear, doesn't wear gloves, and is in jeans and a t-shirt like he's preparing this in their living room which isn't sanitary or desirable. Tables and chairs are poorly laid out and are in terrible shape for a restaurant. 

Service:

Slow, and inefficient. The orders you write down take a long time to come and the server always seemed to giving you an attitude for the way you were ordering.

Food:

brutal quality. Badly cut. Sashimi still attached, way too much rice on the rolls and just tasted terrible. This is by far one of the worst sushi places I've ever eaten from, including days old grocery store sushi. 

PLEASE DON'T GO HERE. They charge a 10% service charge which is despicable. People who like this sushi must've never tried good sushi. Everything is terrible, poorly constructed, and poorly cut or cooked.

{"text":"This place is $21.99+tax for AYCE sushi all week long (even though the menu says from Mon-Thurs), the lowest I've seen anywhere in Markham. This is a small restaurant with simple decor; it is well-lit and the chairs are comfortable. The food was decent, I wouldn't get the tempura calamari again, but other than that our party of 4 enjoyed everything. The service wasn't stellar and they forgot something we'd ordered but overall it wouldn't turn me off of returning. There is a 10% service fee which is fine by me. There is lots of free parking in the plaza parking lot. I will be going back to this place for sure."}
{"text":"Daisuki is an okay Japanese place for casual dining.  They serve both AYCE & a la cart dinners.  We ordered a bibimbap and an assorted sashimi plate.  The bibimbap was not up to par.  The sashimi  was really fresh for an AYCE place.  The size of the slice was small, however.   

The service was a little slow as there was only 1 waiter who also worked on the sushi bar.  They didn't bring us tea until we asked for it.  The decor, or lack of, was nothing to talk about.  

It is worthy to mention that they charge $20 for AYCE dinner from Monday to Sunday.  This means there is no $2 surcharge for weekend, making it probably the least expensive AYCE Japanese restaurant on weekends in Markham."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout here (spicy salmon and cali roll). Service over the phone was friendly, sushi was average but well priced. I had half the food and with 2 hours had immense stomach pains. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Lunch AYCE is now $13.99. Looked over the AYCE but really couldn't find much that I liked so opted for the a la cart option. 

Bolgogi tempura bento $8.95 
Bolgogi sashimi bento $10.95

Both bento box came with miso soup, salad and white rice. Food was pretty average. The tempura was done pretty well though. For the price everything was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Service is not bad from what I experienced.  AYCE weekday lunch buffet is $13.00.  The only negative aspect is the long wait for the sushi to come (almost 30 min).  But I guess that's sort of understandable since there is like 3 people making food for a whole restaurant.  Decent decor and spacing and cleanliness.  

Sushi is all very good.  I like this restaurant and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Monday, 1 person, AYCE sushi lunch.

I love how the price is $12.99 for AYCE lunch no matter whether it's a weekday or weekend, compared to other places that charge a premium for Fridays and weekends. I also love the beef ribs, the meat had lots of flavour and was soft and chewy (I like it that way). When I initially sat down, the service was good as I was one of two parties in the restaurant.

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, the front store area is clean and modern-looking. There is a power outlet in the far corner of the restaurant if you have a laptop.

Unfortunately, that's where most of my loves end, and my gripes appear. :( The sushi is nothing spectacular - the toppings on the dragon rolls were very thin and the maki is made of mostly rice. The eel maki for instance had an extremely small piece of eel and a medium-sized piece of cucumber - just see my picture!

I did not try the sashimi, as I went at lunch.

For better maki, try Oban Sushi at Bur Oak and Kennedy or Yang's Kitchen at Highway 7 between Warden and Main St. Unionville."}
{"text":"I donno about anyone else but I ate here once and it was the first time I kept the receipt. I thought I was gonna get food poisoning. The white fish were yellowish brown and looks like it's been out for a long time. Same with the other fish. The worst sushi place ever.

I wish I could give negative star ratings"}
{"text":"Not good, would not recommend coming here. They do not care about heir customers or anything going on in this restaurant whenever it is dead and I walk in the owners are sleeping on the booths we sit at fooling around... last time I came here for take out I ordered the green dragon roll only to discover when I got home the avocado on top and inside the roll was BLACK and no longer good to eat. No idea why the chef thought it was acceptable to serve it to me. Very cheap and not a high end place to eat at. Do not come here."}
{"text":"A small treasure that I found! True it's not busting at the seams with people trying to get in, but that's why I called Daisuki a small treasure. And it's ALL MINE. heh heh.. :oP

The sushi there is very fresh! True, their menu is not as extensive as other places I've been to, but who cares when the quality of sushi you get is so good! 

My fav roll there is the Green Dragon roll. Their rolls are HUGE. so good!

The staff is attentive and helpful. 

I love eating here!"}
{"text":"Good food served well for a decent price."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times since it's so close to home. But after my last experience I doubt I'll ever be back. Their AYCE lunch special is very cheap, and that's a strong selling point, however the service left me feeling severely unsatisfied.

In my last experience, upon arrival it took 10 minutes before we were even brought a menu, and there was only one other table of 3 dining in the entire restaurant. We had to ask several times for tea, and even for plates and then chopsticks. The service is VERY slow, and patrons that order after you may be served first. But the complete icing on cake was that they include tip on top of their charge (completely undeserved). Even in a less than half filled restaurant, it took half an hour before the server started clearing plates from another table that had already paid and left.

The quality of their sushi is what you would expect. It's not the best, but for the price you can't complain. This place is good for when you want to binge on a budget, but DO NOT go in expecting 5-star customer service. It's also worthy to note that the server was a nice and friendly person, just slow and kind of derp. If the tip is already included, where's the incentive to do a good job? Service here has always been slow, but hopefully that will improve should I ever decide to come back."}
{"text":"Service with bringing the water was kinda slow, but the food was actually pretty nice! Might try the all yu can eat at night sometime!"}
{"text":"Daisuki Sushi is a good neighbourhood AYCE Japanese Restaurant. It's not worth a special trip up here.

Lunch Special ($11.99) is A-OK at this price point. 

- Salmon Sushi
- Spicy Salmon Sushi
- Spicy Salmon Handroll
- Eel Handroll
- California Roll
- Shrimp Tempura
- Deep Fried Tofu
- Korean BBQ Ribs
- Green Tea and Red Bean Ice Cream

All tasted decent. Great to come here if you have sushi/maki cravings as they do have a great selections of different rolls.

Only one waiter who dressed in his casual basketball outfit serving the lunch crowd. He got the job done and I got my tea refilled when I asked for more. Chinese pop music kept the sushi chef and waiter entertained while they were busy at work!

10% tips automatically added to the bill."}
