{"text":"It's hard to find a really high quality vanilla soft serve these days, but it's so good here, it turned me into a vanilla lover!"}
{"text":"I love that this is a small \"hole in the wall\" type of ice cream place. Love love love. Location is good. Lots of street parking (and a nearby lot). I opted for a strawberry banana supreme parfait and it was delightful. Not too sugary and not too sickly at all. Next time I would like to try the scoop ice cream with waffle cone, though... and a hot dog. :3"}
{"text":"Went to pops after dining in the area.  It's a tiny place and there was a guy visiting with the server so it made it even tighter.  He was not eating anything and seemed so interested in what we were ordering.  It made it uncomfortable.  I think they had about 8 flavours and vanilla soft serve.  I expected more.  Portions are tiny for the price.  They also make sandwiches.  I don't think I'll return.  I'd rather go elsewhere for Frozen yougart."}
{"text":"Cute little ice cream shop. The lady behind the counter was super friendly & we got to meet a lovely couple visiting from Ontario. My little boy took a while to order but there was none of the 'tude you often get when that happens. She was more than happy to let him take his time (there wasn't anyone waiting). His ice cream was good & my caramel sundae was awesome. I want to try a banana split or one of the Nathan's hotdogs next time."}
{"text":"This is a great little place and a nice short walk from Inglewood, perfect for getting ice cream on a hot summer's day.  I had the grilled onion and cheese hot dog panini - yum! It was the best hot dog I have had ever. To drink I got a Boyland's diet cherry soda, and I skipped dessert but will be back for a homemade ice cream sandwich - they have fresh baked cookies and McKay's ice cream.   Oh and the patio is really great, shaded and nice and small. This is one of Calgary's few historic ice cream shops. It is pretty sweet!  Only thing missing for 5 stars: Foothills Creamery hard ice cream (sorry Cochrane Foothills Creamery Calgary made ice cream just tastes better)  and more soda selections. Italian soda's would be pornstar."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we discovered another little gem!!  Delicious ice cream, parfaits, and soda in a pretty little spot near the river. I had the banana something or other, and it was yummy! My bf had a cream caramel sundae. We sat in the side garden in the evening sun. It was the perfect end to a warm August day.  If you haven't been to this Calgary landmark, you must..."}
{"text":"I'll be honest here and tell you straight-up that I managed Pop's in the summer of 2010. So take my review with a grain of salt and let me tell you why I liked working there and still like to come back.   It's a real old-fashioned neighbourhood ice cream shop and as both a manager and customer I love the feeling of community that comes with the place. I loved hearing customers' stories and learning more about them and I know the current staff feels the same.  It may get crowded  on rainy days, but when the weather cooperates, the patio and the garden (at the south end of the building) are great places to enjoy a cold treat or a grilled dog/panini. And the outdoor speakers bring the music of the 50s-60s to you.  The ice cream flavours are always changing and customer requests are often taken into consideration so speak up about your favourite MacKay's flavour. Last year we created Pop's signature Coca Cola with real candy coke bottles! This year, they have re-introduced a turkey panini with cranberry mustard and apple-onion compote. I tried my first one on Saturday and it was delicious! The grilled Nathan's hot dogs are really tasty, but if you want something that won't tip the scale I would suggest trying the turkey panini.  A true Calgary treasure full of history and carried forward from the city's earliest days. If you're floating down the Elbow, consider making Pop's your landing spot. Easily accessible from the Elbow River bike path and close to Inglewood for a walking detour.   So come see for yourself and write your own unbiased reviews."}
{"text":"Back in the day I was the ice cream girl in Millet. Two freezers full of Mackay's ice cream, milkshakes and treats, what a glorious summer job-not to mention the free ice cream!  Pop's reminds me of those days. It's a little corner ice cream shop in Inglewood. It's a little off the beat and track, but a cute stop for a Saturday cone. With 8 flavours of hard ice cream from Mackay's, and soft ice cream to make your favourite ice cream treats (think floats, milkshakes, parfaits), I think you might find me here a lot this summer.  One difference from my ice cream girl days, is that Pop's also serves Nathan's Hot Dogs. Go figure! Split dogs or regular, grilled with cheese and onions or loaded with banana peppers, that's bound to be a delicious dog.  Outside, there's a sign welcoming you to enjoy their garden. It's not obvious which garden they mean from the interior, but walk a few feet south along the building and you'll find it. It's a cute little inlet furnited with some old metal tables and chairs, and decorated in a style that reminds me of The Secret Garden. A quiet neighbourhood, and overlooking a park, this goes down as blissfully indulgent in my books."}
{"text":"Spencer's co-worker told him about this place and we decided to hit it up on the long weekend.  Pop's Dairy Bar is not exactly in Inglewood but pretty darn close.  It is located in the corner section of a building and the decor is a tiny 50's style diner.  They have an ice cream shaped neon sign thats hard to miss.  At first, when you walk in, the area is quite small but oh so cute.  The two ladies that work there are so sweet...suggesting orders and telling us what is most popular.  I decided to go with the turkey panini which is grilled with lettuce, cranberry mustard, and apple onion compote.  Spence went with grilled Nathan's hotdog.  And we both got lemonade, one strawberry and one regular.  We watched the lady make our lemonade, freshly squeezed!  There was the option to get a small or large, we got one of each.  The strawberry lemonade has pieces of strawberry inside.  They were both quite tasty!  My turkey panini was very nice...not too heavy, just perfect.  At first bite you can really taste the apple onion compote.  Its a little overpowering the turkey but its different and tasted great.  Spence just got ketchup and cheese on his hotdog and it was tasty...nothing too special.  After our little meals, we decided to share some ice cream.  We went with what the lady suggested, I think it was some cookie crumble sundae.  The bottom layer was caramel, then ice cream, with a layer of oreo cookie pieces and ice cream, topped with whipped cream and of course, a cherry on top!  It was quite delicious I must say. :)  All in all, our experience at Pop's Dairy Bar was great, the service was fast and the ladies were really nice.  It would be perfect if you were biking riding in the area and stopped by for a quick bite.  They do have 3 small tables outside for seating and about 4 spots inside.  The total cost for the 2 lemonades, turkey panini, Nathan's hotdog and ice cream sundae came out to about ~$30.  I recommend this place for sure, but not as an everyday snack! :P"}
