{"text":"Congee Time is our favorite place for Chinese food in the city. I have had the opportunity to travel to China more than once and although the food here cannot compare with the dishes I had in China the chow at congee time is the best Chinese cuisine I've had in Toronto. It's also quite affordable (just wish it were closer to the downtown core!) Generous portions; we always go home with leftovers. Over the years, we've visited for lunch and dinner - it's a bit quieter during lunch or early dinner hours.

Top dishes: Hot and Sour Soup (and any of the Congees), Salt and Pepper Squid, Crispy Roasted Chicken, Eggplant and Pork Hot Pot, Olive and Pork Green Beans, and Oyster Hot Pot. 

Cons: The atmosphere isn't pleasant for two reasons: First, it is cold. Very cold,almost as if they keep the front door open. Second, it's extremely noisy, made worse by the busboy staff who smash and bang the plates together with fervor (irksome when you're sitting two feet away); these detract from the dining experience."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, though my favourite is their Fried Rice Noodle with Sliced Beef & X.O. Sauce but it would be even better if they would cut back on the oil.
Yes the atmosphere is quite noisy which makes is hard to converse with others at your table, but you do get used to it after a while.
Service is usually pretty fast, and pricing is decent."}
{"text":"I've experienced sit-in and take out, and I've been satisfied with the wait time and service. I would say the food is your standard Cantonese cuisine. However, the quality of the food could be better. I mean, come on, at least add some chopped green onions to my congee, would you? Also, as a vegetarian, there are very limited options; for example, the congee I order are bland and uninspired. So for the vegetarians out there, this is not a good choice."}
{"text":"Congee Time is great for a quick, inexpensive meal.  The service is really fast and I have never had to wait long for a table.  The menu is fairly big and there are many options for congee, noodles, rice and appetizers.

I think you get good value for your money at Congee.  While the food might not be find dining and you might not get the best ingredients, it is pretty tasty, the portions are pretty big (I always have leftovers) and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"We have been going here every few months for a number of years.  Yesterday's trip was likely the last.
The food was unbelievably salty and the portions were smaller than they used to be (almost thankfully).  The men's bathroom was in terrible disrepair with half-covered graffiti and the sole toilet seat lying on the floor making it very difficult for my son.
It won't be \"Congee Time\" for us again!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, family dinners.  They must use a lot of MSG, always get a headache after a meal here.  So avoid if you have sensitivities or allergies to MSG.  The food is ok, a few items were just too gluey for my liking."}
{"text":"Service here was good. I ordered bbq pork and duck on rice and it did not taste good. The pork was very dry and bland and it did not look like it was really BBQed. The duck was only okay. I am used to the quality of chinese bbq at Sam Woo at Bamburgh Circle. With all the different restaurants in the area, I will not go back."}
{"text":"3.5 star. They have decent service, better than congee Wong. Price is fair and food is slightly above average. I would actually go there again just for congee. It's close up subway too so good place to drop by after work."}
{"text":"This place is near where we live and in the same mall as my dentist and podiatrist -- so we are there quite often.  Price is right!  The two of us can easily eat for $15-20, although if you go for the lobster it surely has to be more expensive.  Tea is offered free.  Service, while not overly polite, is quick and food comes from the kitchen steaming hot.  Lots of families and larger groups eat here too since they have large round tables in the center and smaller booths at the sides.

We think all the food we have ordered has been very tasty, although clearly high in fat and salt as is food in most Chinese restaurants. Among our favourite dishes are congee, shrimp in maggi sauce, udon with seafood and XO sauce, tango mango chicken and shrimp, fried turnip patties, oyster patties and deep fried dough fritters.  It's hard for me to list only a few dishes because we've never eaten anything there we didn't like except for the shrimp wonton!"}
{"text":"We had a terrible dining experience at this restaurant. The staff are very rude and they don't care about their customers. When we got there at the restaurant, the servers were eating at one of the tables, we were waiting for the server to come up and take our order but instead he came back to the table where they were eating. That is so unprofessional, I was raising my hand to get noticed by them but still they just ignored me and they continued eating. There was nothing wrong for them to eat I know that they are human, they have the right to eat but atleast you gotta have 1-2 servers working around. They should take turns! 
Food wise- they served it cold and even the tea that was supposed to be \"hot tea\" was not hot. You can even see the dirt from the tea container. Very disgusting! I would not recommend this place and would not eat again. I found out that there is CONGEE Queen at centrepoint and that is way better than this place.
The customer service at this place (Congee time) is terrible!!  Doesn't deserve even 1 star."}
{"text":"The quality and taste has gone down since it first opened. If your looking for average Chinese food eats, then congee time is just that."}
{"text":"I come to Congee Time to take out food on the way home.  It's a walk away from the Viva Station in Finch.  The food here is good for the price.  This is why you will see a lot of diners during peak hours.  My personal favorites are the turnips and sweet & sour pork.  Can't wait to get home and chow down. :)"}
{"text":"Food was great; came out fast and hot. Service was not impressive, but not a deal breaker. Great joint."}
{"text":"What time is it?!?  
Well, if you are looking for decent Chinese food, served quickly with good portion sizes, at a price that can't be beat - it's Congee Time!!
I have been to this restaurant many times and always left happy with my decision and my meal. It's nothing special, but it's good, filling, and consistent. 
The restaurant can be quite busy during dinner time and this may require that you wait a while for a table, but other than dinner time it's usually quite easy to be seated quickly. 
The restaurant is set up with a number of booths on the side with larger tables in the middle and since the restaurant is basically one big room, it can also get a little loud when it is busy.  
The service is what you would expect from a no frills Chinese restaurant - it's fairly quick and efficient but not overly friendly or welcoming. The wait staff are busy so you often need to flag one down if you need anything, but once you get their attention, your request is filled without fuss or delay. 
The menu is extensive and while I haven't come close to trying everything, whatever I have had has been very decent and filling. Dishes like congee are quite good; nice and hot; available with a variety of ingredients; and generally quite satisfying.  Other dishes I have tried and enjoyed include shrimp fried rice, stir fried rice noodles with beef, Singapore vermicelli noodles, crispy skin fried chicken, seafood chow mein, and a variety of vegetable dishes. The only misstep that I have encountered is the vegetable dish has occasionally been lukewarm to slightly cold rather than steaming hot. 
Generally, most dishes consist of large portion sizes, especially if you factor in the price, and you will likely find yourself taking home some leftovers.  The prices here are very affordable for what you get and thus, your meal turns out to be an incredibly good value for the size and quality of the food you receive. 
So, if you want decent Chinese food (and lots of it) at a price point that's hard to beat, make sure to make some time for Congee Time!  Recommended."}
{"text":"Love the roasted duck, beef or shrimp chun fun, yeung chow fried rice and BBQ pork. They also have great chicken wings -crispy outside, juicy inside. Prices are good. Food consistent. That said, the wonton soup and hot & sour soup here is not the greatest. Take out times are pretty standard :)"}
{"text":"Not bad not bad not bad!
This is my first congee expereince and while I didn't actually order congee I have to say I enjoyed it. We only got two dishes as my dad said that it would fill us both up plus provide extras, which he was right it did. 
We got the BBQ pork with rice and the spicy beef in a black bean sauce. 
Both were very good, the pork was a little fatty for my liking but I just tore it off. The beef was excellent I had several helpings and there was plenty to spare at the end of the meal.
For the most part it seemed like the foods came out quick, we sat close to the kitchen and it was like dishes came out in rapid succession of one another. 
Our first dish arrived less than 5 minutes after we ordered, the second however lagged which annoyed my dad (I'm pretty sure it's because he only has an hour for lunch) and he had to ask to waitress to check on it, but by my approximation it was maybe 10-15 minutes. Our check got lost somewhere between the counter 10 ft away and our table so my dad had to ask again for it. It was completely crowded so I'm sure it wasn't hard to loose. 
The onlyt drawback to the restaurant I'd had to say is that I could barely hear, it was so packed that I had to shout across the table at my dad who was 2 feet away. 
The decor is nice with booths (one of which I hope to receive next time) along the side for larger parties. 
We said we'd go back next time and actually order to congee and see what it's all about. Overall a good lunch for 2 with a total of 17 bucks with tax and tip."}
{"text":"I've come here on previous occasions with family and friends. It was okay. Good selection but last week is going to mark my last visit here. 

The flat rice noodle ho fan satay beef dish almost destroyed me. The gastro effects were not immediately felt.  Needless to say I was besties with my toilet and roll of Charmin.  I was out with food poisoning for almost 36 hr!

Never again."}
{"text":"Pretty good value for $ and tasty food. They accomodated 11 of us last minute with no problem. Lots of variety beyond congee. I remember one noodle dish with tendon and veg was only $5.75 but fed many of us. Far from home but would def go again if in the area. Free parking. Bathrooms are what you would expect in a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't come on family day, crazy busy plus seems like they don't know where the orders are. One table waited 2 hours for rice and the pickup orders aren't ready wait times.for.pickup are over 40 minutes if you are unlucky."}
{"text":"This place is reasonable for congee. Definitely not the best, though. I find their congee to be too watery, and their rice is pretty plain, but they have good variety and the price point for being on Yonge Street is reasonable. Their duck and bok choy are good.

Definitely a great place to go in a big group, as the prices turn out ridiculously cheap."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and my grandmother.... I bring her up because she is very picky when it comes to Chinese food. 
And she was happy and satisfied. What more do I want? Haha
Their congee is superb. Perfect for the cold weather.
Will come back again and again"}
{"text":"My dining hall... Just downstairs. Cheap price (really really cheap given the location) with not bad service. Suggest to enhance the price a little bit with more stuff to choose like crabs. A conger queen just opened so only change can prevent congee time from being kicked out by competition."}
{"text":"FUCK THIS PLACE!!! I'm on vacation, friends took me here to eat, place was kinda dark, food is so so and with fair surroundings. My main complaint was the service. Our waiter was an obese young man, when compared to a pig, I'd prefer the service of the latter. He was rude, obnoxious and lacked standard customer service."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for quick and yummy Chinese food in the area. I always get a variety of chow mein and this time I got beef. The kind I got is not strictly on the menu but they have the chicken version with the veggies I prefer and I just asked for them to substitute beef. I've done this many times and never had a problem. Everything is so reasonably priced and consistently good that it makes me want to come back often, and I do."}
{"text":"They probably changed chef or owner. Their food doesn't taste as good and their service is definitely lacking from how it used to be. We asked for napkin several times and they finally came. I asked for extra cilantro for my congee and they said they have to charge me extra...-_- and we asked for to go box and the bill several times and never came. So I went to the cash to pay. Everytime I said I wouldn't come back AMD I do only because it's close by. But this time would be the last."}
{"text":"Food gets 4-stars, service gets 1-2.  I'm a regular here.  Highlights for me are their garlic green beans, deep fried pork chops, and the sweet and sour chicken.  Prices are reasonable.  However, the service is generally poor, you have to flag down the staff for everything.  They will not come over to the table unless you go after them.  Getting additional napkins is impossible (they don't want to give out any more than necessary).  If you want cutlery, water, take out containers, you might as well get up and get it yourself.    Many of the waitstaff are inexperienced and not particularly good at their job.  Go for the food and don't expect anything more and you'll be fine"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great quality good for the price you pay. Their dishes are continuously consistent. The beef with black bean is worth ordering, the beef brisket is tender every time, the deep fried squid is another good one, plus the cantonese chow mein is surely the best one you can eat in this area. This place is packed on the weekends. Parking is free, prices are cheap. Service is mediocre and everything else makes up for that. 5/5"}
{"text":"I come here when I need a quick lunch or dinner.  The prices are fair but you usually need to wait a bit on weekends to be seated. 
I usually order some sort of congee.  The congee there is actually quite good and always hot...not luke warm like in other places.  I find the deep fried squid always good and you can't go wrong with it.  The beef sirloin dishes are always good as well.  Finally I would always order a noodle dish.  Their noodle dishes are a hit or miss.  Sometimes too oily or sometimes it's overflowing with food that you can't finish.  It's not a gourmet place but it's god for a quick fix and on the run.  
However yesterday I noticed they implemented a cash only policy which is crap and only means they will be going out of business soon."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars
Great food! Multiple selections on congee, most of which are really tasty. I usually get the tofu corn congee which is great. They have a tulip cake thing with xo sauce which is amazing! Noodle's good as well, stir fry's good. Its just good congee food all round. O, and one thing that u must try's their chili sauce, its savory on top of spicy. Goes well with almost anything! 

Price: 5 stars
Once I went with a friend, had two congee, noodles and a side dish. The bill, with tips came up to twenty or so dollars and we had 2 boxes of to go containers left. Its just really cheap good comfort food.

Parking: 5 stars
Its in a relatively dead plaza, parking spots are always available. Worse comes to worse, u's have to walk a lil further to the other end of the lot.

Location/ambiance: 3 stars
Its cheap good food owned by asians, so i's have to say the ambiance isn't exactly date friendly. Its relatively clean and lit. No design, no specific vibe. 

Service: 4 stars
Unlike western restaurants where you get a dedicated server, asian restaurants splits the work up between all their servers. Servers isn't as friendly and wouldn't make a huge effort unless you've been there alot of times and know them well enough. And make sure you raise your hand if you need something, cause that's how things work, if you need something, just ask. You'll usually be amazed at how fast they do stuff!"}
{"text":"Standard cantonese food at standard prices; satisfying enough to get your fried rice/noodle/congee fix. Like the food, the prices are comparable to other chinese restaurants. 

The speed of food delivery is always pretty quick and the food is usually consistent. 

We ordered the Black bean beef rice, fish slice with thousand year old egg congee and fried crullers.

All dishes were tasty and true to my knowledge/experience of canto dishes. 

In particular, the shrimp wonton soup is usually my go-to."}
{"text":"Large menu. Decent food in general. Lots of noodle and meat options and the food comes out quickly. Lots of parking. Good HK tea. Today's pork was drier than usual and the skin on the duck wasn't rendered enough."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. If you have the time, go to another congee place for better Chinese food. Quick service but they treat customers like garbage."}
{"text":"2.5/5 stars. I've been to this location a few times over the years and always leave wishing something about the experience was a bit better. The food can be good but there is not a lot of consistency, sometimes the food tastes a little off and have definitely needed a washroom nearby afterwards on more than one occasion. Like other greasy spoon Chinese restaurants the vegetables and meat are sloppily cut and presented, meat is often knobbly or has odd bits of fat/tending bits, veggies are usually not washed very well and often you can taste it when you get down to the centre of the veggies, big turn off for me especially considering pesticides and stuff used today. The service is not great, very curt and not attentive, you must flag them down to get any service, but this is also a more common style in Chinese restaurants. Food comes out quickly though. I do like their Cantonese chow mein but this place could be a lot better with little tweaks that otherwise always leave the experience a bit wanting."}
{"text":"Good food, wonderful price. For example, the price for a BBQ duck in Toronto is 22+tax while in Congeetime, it's 18."}
{"text":"This place is just one of those congee places with averagw food quality.  The service was so-so as they were more concerned about chatting with their co-workers rather than giving service.  I overheard one the servers complaining about the boss.   I guess people who are working has something against their boss is normal, but don't let customers hear them.  It certainly did not help my appetite.

The seafood congee we ordered was pretty good.  However, the deep fried ribs with sweet and sour sauce was not very good as the batter was a little soggy and too thick.  The sauce was rather bland.  Anyways, just another day another meal."}
{"text":"Food is OK. Had to ask for a new bowl multiple times before getting one without food bits already in it. I'm ordering food for a reason, don't give me the previous guest's leftovers. Disgusting show of hygienic practices. They don't seem surprised by their dirty cutlery and bowls. Manager or whoever leaned on our table as we were eating. Get off my damn table. Fried squid made me question everything. Never coming back. Couldn't wait to write this, had to complete this in restaurant. Can't wait to leave. Say no to gulags. Human cruelty is afoot."}
{"text":"Typical Chinese restaurants. Servers are quick and efficient but not the friendliest. The noise level is quite high and space is tight if you are seated somewhere in the middle at the round tables. Food is nothing special but the same old Chinese take-out style. I highly recommend to RSVP and call ahead of time because the waiting time can range from 20-45hr (possibly more)."}
{"text":"Food was good. Probably best for big groups. 
Variety is the key to success here."}
{"text":"BEST CHEAP CHINESE FOOD EVER!!! I go here at least once a week. The food taste great on a consistent basis and the prices are SUPER CHEAP!  Service is your typical chinese restaurant service.... you go for the Food and prices... not the service.

Go here if you want cheap fast and tasty chinese food!!!!"}
{"text":"It's yet another Chinese congee place. I've tried so many that I don't even bother to review them as most of them are very similar. This one I'd review as it is the closest Chinese restaurant to my home. Aside from being close to my home yet there is nothing special about them. Yet nothing terribly wrong with them (usually).

Menu Selection:
If there's one thing Chinese restaurants are famous for, it's their extensive menu selection. You can get the namesake congees (in a big bowl or in smaller portions). They have various fried noodles/rice. There are some appetizer like dishes like fried calamri or Chinese style fried chicken. Pretty typical menu with a good mix of popular dishes.

Prices:
A-OK. Comparable to other Chinese places. A little bit on the cheap side. Pretty good value as the portions are large. 

Quality:
With so many items on the menu, clearly there is a lot of room to go wrong. Most of the time the food is fine though. One time they put a lot of Chinese sausages in a hot pot when they shouldn't have. That was terrible. Sometimes the fried noodles are a little greasy, but that's common. Their sauces on some of the dishes are a little too starchy for my taste. Like a lot of Chinese places, they add MSG. If I eat a lot, I can feel sleepy after. You pretty much get what you paid for. For example, if you get tofu + fish with rice, you can bet that there's going to be more tofu than fish. But the fish portion is not bad. 

Service as always is non-existent, like in most Chinese restaurants. 

Overall, it's a really standard place. It's not a place that I recommend going out of the way for. There are tons of congee places around GTA. I basically just go to the closest one and this one happens to be it."}
{"text":"Have dined here a total of three times and thought it was time I wrote a review.  You can never go wrong with these \"Juk, fun, meen, fan\" (Congee, Rice Noodles, Chow Mein & Rice) restaurants.  You can always rely on consistency in terms of the taste, and variety.  I have had the Seafood Garlic Fried Rice, Soy Sauce & Bean Sprout Fried Beef Rice Noodle, and the Yin Yang Fried Rice here.  All very good.  I will say though that the Fried Beef Rice Noodle was a little bit too greasy for my liking... It was so greasy that it glided off my chopsticks.  And their website says something about how their dishes are prepared in a low-fat method, using water as the method of cooking... Who are we kidding?! 

The service is a hit and miss.  At the beginning of our dinner, it took me maybe... oh I don't know... three tries to flag down a waiter to take our order... And then towards the end, (albeit it was a waitress this time), was very attentive and was quick to refill our tea.  The restaurant has plenty of seating, and is very spacious.  Would definitely dine here again."}
{"text":"This is my home base for quick, inexpensive Cantonese cuisine.  Yes, it's because I live very near it.  But even if I didn't, I would still come here for the inexpensive options.

Based off the Congee Wong formula, Congee Time does its best to mimick the setup.  I don't know if the management is related to the Congee Wong enterprise, but the inside decor is almost exact - including the centralized cashier.

Again, as in my Congee Wong review, when considering three points:
1) Cantonese authenticity
2) Price for quantity
3) Taste for Price.
Congee Time, like Congee Wong is a hit.

However, when comparing similar dishes, Congee Time's chefs don't get it like Congee Wong's.  Something's missing.  That's not to say this place is subpar...infact, there are quite a few dishes here that stand on its own.

I really enjoy:
1) Fried rice noodles with chili - bewarned, this is NOT a vegetarian dish - has shrimps, pork, chinese sausage...and an almost southeast asian flavour.  Definitely one of my favourites.
2) Half roasted chicken
3) Half roasted duck (very salty and fatty but that's why I like it)
4) Congee - preserved egg (black) with pork
5) Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce
6) Beef fried rice is very good here

I'm glad this place is so close to home.  I love it.
Authentic Cantonese cuisine steps away.  
Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"CONSISTENT great quality and cheap chinese food...this place never fails to disappoint!"}
{"text":"The environment is ok, but the food is just so-so and a little bit over priced. I have been to lots of Cantonese restaurants and this one can only get 2stars based on its taste."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a quick, cheap simple meal, so this location is almost perfectly placed should I be in this quadrant of the city. 

Not sure if these Congee Star, Queen and Time are own by the same organization, but they are very cookie cutter. 

These places aren't going to wow you, but if you're looking for a quick snack or a big meal, and don't want to get too fancy, these joints are good bets."}
{"text":"A non-chain congee restaurant that has been around for as long as I can remember at this little plaza located on Yonge in between Finch and Steeles. Food is quickly served here, arrives fresh and steaming, and quantity is huge.

Good for when you are hungry late at night as they close at 1am on weekends.

Never really has a line up, as it is relatively empty compared to Congee Queen / Congee Wong / Mr Congee.

Recommend their seafood congee, chow mein, rice noodle dishes, satay stir fried beef on vegetables dish.

Service is ok."}
{"text":"I looked across to another table with a couple BIG bellied men and if you saw them you would also assume they know a thing or two about eating as they shared what must have been 5+ dishes between them.  They looked like the kind of people that we Chinese say, \"Eat people, don't spit bone out\".

I followed suit with their order of Fried Clam with Black Bean Sauce which they wiped clean thinking it must have been a decent dish.  I found out that you shouldn't judge a stomach by it's size.  Found out the hard way!  Their stomach must have been full of JUNK.  @@

While the Seafood Super Bowl($7.75) and Shrimp & Chive Rice Noodle Roll($3.50) satisfies the usual Cantonese appetite considering the value that is typical of these HK-style restaurants, it was the Fried Clam with Black Bean Sauce($9.25) where we got more than what we bargained for.   2.5 *Star*

Excessive sodium on the Fried Clams meant I had a Teapot attached to my right hand fulltime while my Teacup to my left hand.  I question myself how much more SHIT those two guys next table would have chugged down.  In some way, I was impressed.

Possibly I've chosen one of their worst dishes of the night.  15 years ago when I was quite salty, I wouldn't have mind but it's different now."}
{"text":"The Curry chicken rice (h22) on menu isnt very good and certainly not worth the $9.32 tax in. Barely cooked Chicken, small portion, imitation curry flavour, tiny veggies and a mountain of white rice. This place has so many options so avoid The curry on ride this one like the plague. Much better tasting options. I'm Happy the restaurant gave me my money back when I returned it."}
{"text":"the service is terrible, but the food is amazing and the portions and prices are great. i asked for water and the guy mopping the floor got it for me. didnt even wash his hands. we were told we have to tip, which was ridiculous. we ended up not tipping anything after we paid. she assumed we werent going to tip cuz my friend and i both paid with debit and were going to leave a cash tip, but after her demand for a tip, we decided not to at all.
 the fried rice is great and the kung po(sp?) chicken is amazing. i'd eat here again but it would only be take out. the lady seemed annoyed that we were there and wasnt nice or welcoming at all. the decor is simple and nice."}
{"text":"A trip to Toronto is just not right unless you eat at Congee Time. 
The super supreme super seafood congee is fantastic."}
{"text":"We went to Congee Time on 06 November 2017 at around 14:30.  It was quite a large place with booths on both sides and round tables in between.  I had the Pork & Gold Preserved Egg Congee for $5.25. It was tasty however not as good as I have had before at Congee Wong.  The preserved egg had a bit of a strange taste.  My husband ordered Beef & Fish Balls Noodle in Soup also for $5.25.  He was pleased with it, but nothing to really write home about.  The reason for only 2 stars, is the wait staff were not very friendly, no small chit chat, no smiles, just placed the dish on the table, not asking which dish was for whom and even the cashier when I went to pay, she was talking on the phone and didn't even say thank you.  Also I think it's time they purchased new dishes.  Enough said."}
{"text":"They serve a lot of the typical chines restaurant dishes but don't do an especially good job on any of them. The biggest selling point for most people would likely be the prices, as they are a bit lower than their competitors. Service was not the greatest."}
{"text":"This is a great place if you're a hearty eater. They give you tons of (average tasting) food at a very reasonable price. For about 8 dollars a person, you can eat as much as your heart desires. The food came out of the kitchen pretty quick too, as per many Chinese restaurants.

But I should warn you that it's extremely loud in here. You won't be able to carry a conversation with whomever you're dining with. Also, like many Chinese restaurants, the service is on the bad side. Getting a new jug of tea took about 10 minutes for the staff.

If you want a lot of decent-mediocre Chinese food at a very good price, come right in. If you're looking for a quality dining experience... you shouldn't be eating at a Chinese joint."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent authentic Chinese food in a contemporary dining atmosphere. The food is of an exceptional quality and very tasty. Service is good. Plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"Always come with my brothers.  Always order beef tendon noodle soup, a chow mein dish, preserved egg congee, and deep fried spicy squid.  Aside from the squid everything is always to my liking.  The squid is hit and miss but more hit than miss.  One thing I learned is if you stack up all your dishes and wipe the table you are not expected to tip."}
{"text":"You cannot beat the price you're getting for all the food you're able to order here. The menu is huge with a great variety of dishes and mains, and you're served quickly within 5-10 minutes. I've never been to a restaurant that has served me in such a small amount of time. Can get pretty loud and a bit chaotic over the weekends, but if you want to get the most bang (food) for your buck, go here. Waiters can be a bit frustrating to deal with concerning the amount of people who dine there, and there isn't anything too aesthetically outstanding about the interior. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is actually one of the places that I go for congee and \"dim summy\" things when I'm in the area.  Why?  It's probably one cheapest places you can get plus it's not half bad either.

The congee here isn't exactly the best I've had.  Basically your run of the mill rice in a blender with a bunch of thickener added to it (bah, more thickener = less rice).  Personally I'd rather this than a crapload of MSG in it that makes it taste really salty.  I usually order the minced beef congee.  I'm pretty sure the rest of the different kinds are more or less the same.

Out of all the dishes, I think my favourite one is called \"long moon chow mei\" (I have no idea if this is actually what it's called on the menu but it translates to dragon's door fried noodles).  The dish is a fried rice noodle (the thin kind) with pork, egg and veggies.  And at around 7 dollars for a giant plate of it, it is probably the best bang for your buck.  

Oh, and their hot sauce that they make in house is actually pretty good!  Out of all the places I've tried this is probably the best one.  Of course it doesn't compare to the stuff I make... but meh, you can't be perfect ;-)"}
{"text":"My first experience here was decent, it was in the evening and wasn't busy at all.

The servers were very attentive and quick. The food wasn't that great though but had huge portions for the amount we paid.

{"text":"Love this place for lunch. It's cheap and the portions are generous. I highly recommend the fried rice noodle with chicken in satay sauce which I often dream about."}
{"text":"Sad that they're leaving/closing. Love this joint over congee queen or congee wong. I think it's tastier and ingredients are better, as in they don't cheap out."}
{"text":"this is the only place like this for a few blocks. closest other place would be over at Leslie-finch. So, these guys got a monopoly on the neighbourhood, esp all the asians  in the yonge-finch area. 

Nice and cheap (standard among this type of place) $5 for a small congee bowl. 
$5-10 for all other dishes. $10+ for anything with seafood.

Food is fine, nothing to complain about. Somehow not quite as good as their competition over at Leslie-Finch plaza, but it still competes. 

This place is still always quite busy. with lots of takeout orders. So the food will fresh. 
Plaza has plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Food menu is authentic! 
Can say the food was good though..

The restaurant was pretty empty for dinner on a weekday.. Mostly non-Chinese customers

Ordered three types of rice rolls..
The rice rolls were thick and dry.. Like tough dough compared to what it should be.. Almost like it was microwaved as opposed to freshly steamed.. (1 star, max 1.5)

Congee was ok, typical fast food MSG (3 stars)

Fruits from the drinks was from cans.. Plus sugared water.. (2 stars)

Soup noodles was also over MSGed (2 stars)

Service was slow even tho it was empty..
2 servers on duty for a restaurant with 30 plus tables.. Obviously wasn't expecting much business..

For the same type of restaurant, there aren't many alternates close by.. Go to Congee Wong if you can.. 

The bill total was average price.. These types of places are usually cheap with large portions enough to dine in and take-home after..

Menu is big, maybe other items would taste better.. So benefit of the doubt, 2 stars overall"}
{"text":"Been here quite a bit. Always good even during busyest times. Good portions reasonble price."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go when you are hungry & in the area. It was pretty much the only place opened. They close at 1am (Friday & Sat). 12am (Sunday-Thurs). 

Service was ok. We were there late and they really wanted to close. But they were very fast and nice. 

Food was as expected for these Congee places. The Curry Fried Rice Noodles was a bit dry though. Congee was ok. Prices were decent."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting, so unsanitary. I watched all the staff do the most unsanitary thing while I was there eating. The most disgusting thing was when I needed to use the washroom at the end of the night. Walked into the woman's washroom and there was a male staff in the women's washroom, cleaning a dirty toilet brush with feces on it, in the woman's hand washing sink. That is the most disgusting thing I have ever seen ever in my life. And each bathroom door had dirt all over it. This place definitely doesn't get cleaned. 

I believe, that if I restaurant keeps it's bathroom clean. Then the kitchen is clean."}
{"text":"Must try: Fried Squid with Spicy Salt

I don't know why but for some reason I thought this place was supposed to be sketchy and served unauthentic congee (maybe because it was tucked away in the corner of a plaza with other mish mosh stores totally overshadowed by Food Basics?)... but that turned out to be such a misconception I enjoyed my meal even more than I would ever hoped for. 

Spoiled by the Congee Queens, I expect to have a mediocre lunch and move on with my day. But all the dishes we ordered were delicious. (1) Seafood Super Bowl congee: well flavoured well cooked with a generous amount of seafood. I liked how soft the squid was which turned out to be a theme as you can see. (2) Fried Rice Noodle with Sliced Beef in Soya sauce: the beef was tender, the noodles well seasoned. It's quite oily but it's almost like a requirement for good fried rice noodle. (3) Fried Squid with Spicy Salt: tender, salty, garlicky goodness. Must order! (4) Fried Turnip Cake: quite like the one at Congee Queen, except maybe a little spicier (read: good). (5) Crispy Chicken with Shrimp Crackers: very soft meat with crispy skin, kids will love the crackers and adults with a childhood will too. (6) Fried Sticky Rice with Preserved Meat: only dish we did not enjoy, as it was too hard and bland. 

Overall, a great meal at a very affordable price. Would come again!!

{"text":"This is the type of place that have a very cheap very quick lunch. It is hard to judge sometimes as they have a huge menu and usually some dishes are better than other. We ordered the low mein and chicken with lemon sauce. Not really impressed but I got to fill in my tommy. Portions are huge and the price is pretty good."}
{"text":"OK. I have been a regular at Congee Time since I first moved to Toronto just over a year ago but have never really had an opportunity to write a review.

Now from Yonge street, north of Finch there aren't a lot of decent Asian restaurants whether they be Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, or Chinese.  South of Finch, you have heavy competition.

Congee Time is north of Finch and is still top notch despite not having the competition.  This is a good thing, and this is why I keep going back.  Where most other operations would probably take its clientele for granted, CT does not.  The service is fast, the food is really good Cantonese fare.  This is the stuff I grew up on and they do not disappoint.

Let's start with the namesake 'Congee Time'.  Well, that is their lead in punch...congee that your grandmother would call authentic. Yummy, flavourful, and a definately  piece of Chinese comfort food.  I understand there are other good congee places in town as well, I'll have to give them a try as well.

The menu is vast and just about everything averages 4/5 stars.  This place has good food...fast...hot...and in hearty portions for a price that won't break the bank.  I recently brought my cousin and her family here while they were visiting from Montreal, and they were impressed at the quality from a 'non-Chinatown' restaurant.

The place is large, well lit, family friendly, and set in a modern dining area with booths and tables with anywhere from 2-10 seats.

As with most Chinese restaurants, I'd like to see the toilets maintained and repaired.  Seriously! It cost you a star!

I don't believe there is delivery available, but you can always call ahead and pick up.  It takes them 10 minutes.  Those woks must be bustin' the burners with quick yummy dishes at that speed.

I recommend Congee Time and cannot wait to try some other dishes on their menu."}
{"text":"Always been decent, I live around the corner so i'm here a couple times a year.  Service and food is very consistent and huge portions.  Much better to eat in than to take out.  

It's one of those places where you should go with a large group so you can order a wide assortment of dishes.  It's usually busy around dinner time but things move fast so i haven't had to wait long.  The plaza has a giant parking lot so you'll never have trouble finding a spot to park."}
{"text":"Came here once and the food is really good and the price is really reasonable. I really love the yea and the lemon chicken."}
{"text":"Good:
Parking - When the only standout good thing that I can think of is parking, you're not doing so well.  Ample parking spaces in the plaza.

Neutral:
Food - Pretty standard Chinese fare with standard prices.  Nothing really stands out as superb.  XO sauce anything doesn't have any real XO in it.

Bad:
Lazy susan - Large tables lack a lazy susan which is crappy since we always have to pass large dishes around.

Worth it?
Meh.  We only come here with grandma-in-law because she's nearby.  It'll do for a random quick bite but I wouldn't make it a point to come and eat here."}
{"text":"Appropriately for its name, the congee (Chinese rice porridge) is pretty good here.  It's cooked the right way so it's smooth and almost creamy in texture.  4+ stars

Fried rice and fried noodles are mostly okay but nothing special.  Beef ho fun (dry fried) is well-cooked in terms of texture, but bland. Lobster w/ ginger & scallion e-fu noodle was disappointing.  Shredded pork on top of egg noodles was okay -- I wouldn't get it again.  2-3 stars

Fried white radish & rice flour cakes are solid, crispy on the outside & tasty.  Not a lot of radish in there, it's mostly rice flour.  Fried up with chicken strips, shrimp and egg.  3.5 stars

I like the cold tapioca w/ coconut milk dessert.  Simple but yummy.  About 4 stars

Not bad if you're in the area & want to grab lunch, but definitely not a destination."}
{"text":"Regular :p
