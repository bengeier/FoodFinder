{"text":"Great neighborhood food and bar! Reasonable prices, Love their Chili, Soups and even their salads are more than just lettuce.  

Order the wings crispy, they are so good, I met a women in there stopping before her plane to Chicago ordering them to go because she couldn't get as good in Chicago. (don't know how they would work as a take out but sure are good there.)"}
{"text":"This place is heaven on earth the wings are amazing , and the grilled cheese and hot dog... man they are good... good fries new remodeled so caught me off guard but great place to catch some football and drink a few beers and grub on some of the best wings in town..."}
{"text":"Our evening didn't start out as Bobby D's as our destination for our Wedding Anniversary dinner. I am sure glad that we ended our game of where are we going to eat now at Bobby D's.
Beverly was our gal, she took great care of us, got us well poured drinks and as my hubby claims the BEST Mozzarella Sticks he has had in years. I didn't take any pictures of our food, when it arrived, just as round two of our drinks was getting ready to cross our lips, we simply dug in and was so very pleased with our dinners.
Hubby got the Fried Chicken Diner with crinkle cut fries and salad with Ranch. Crispy 4 pieces of chicken, not too greasy just right, moist breast meat, fries were exactly how you like your crinkle cut, salad was fresh, shredded carrots was nice, as I like it when they stick extra veggies in things.
I was sold on the Wednesday Diner special - Meatloaf with mashed potatoes, steamed mixed veggies and dinner roll. Portion was HUGE, veggies were tender, not mooshie (which matters), mashed potatoes with brown gravy were home-style heaven and the claims of World Famous Meatloaf, well Beverly did not lie. Bacon wrapped, not dry, if I could have eaten it all I would have as it was so delicious. I took half my plate home and happily have leftovers for lunch.
We finished the meal by sharing the Brownie-a-la mode, which Hubby greedily dove into like he never had eaten a dessert before, he liked it so much.
Cozy place, people were happy, regulars were having a good time and friendly, service was awesome.
After a sketchy start to our Anniversary evening, Bobby D's gave us a great meal, a wonderful memory, and  Beverly was wonderful, we left saying we live close, we should come back more often and we will. Without a doubt."}
{"text":"Oh let me count the ways I love Bobby D's

This hole in the wall is with in walking distance from my house. So my husband and I new to Phoenix decied to venture in here for a quick bite and a drink. The food here is amazing and the atmosphere is laid back. Barb is the best bartender and makes you feel right at home. The locals are all friendly and love new people. Needless to say  we are regulars now. I have not tried anything on the menu that i didn't like and the french dip is awesome.  The chicken wings are super too. It is a great value for the money.   

We love Bobby D's!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, their staff has zero customer service and are extremely slow. Don't bother going here to watch football either because you will be inconvenienced. I've been here many times and every single time I've had something to complain about. If you have no standards, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I ordered wings from here and they were, \"oh so very good!!\" They have a variety of hot, or teriyaki, honey, bbq, etc. I asked for suicide hot - I enjoy my wings dangerously hot, like when it's so hot you can't taste the food. Just so you know, these wings were not hot enough for me but I'm sure they're plenty hot for the normal person. The wings come prepared sloppy or grilled. I ordered my wings grilled and they tasted great. 

The place is a bit small but has a nice charm. The staff are friendly and happy to serve. TVs everywhere!!!"}
{"text":"Bobby D's is a really great local spot. The prices are so reasonable. During happy hour from 3 to 6 you can eat for under 5 bucks. Drinks are super cheap too. Awesome jukebox. Get the wings hot and grilled and you will be in love. The sliders are another favorite."}
{"text":"This place has great wings. Order the grilled hot wings. They are a little on the salty side, so they go awesome with beer. Excellent soups. Rib eys is priced low, so I thought it would suck, but it was actually good, and killer for the price. The staff is really nice. If it gets busy, they can get a little backed up. Clientele is older, thus friendlier. Good drink prices. Vodka gummy bears - strange, but yummy. Only weird thing: the bathroom (men's) is 150 degrees. Combined with no door on stall, I guess they just don't want people lingering in there? Although they do post the sports page, which creates kind of a mixed signal. And they must not see a lot of children in there too often. children are like celebrities in there. In summary, a very friendly neighborhood bar with above average bar food."}
{"text":"Once more led astray by yet another attractive woman.

Passing Bobby D's almost daily for 15 years, I long-ago wrote it off as just another dive bar w/food.

Imagine my surprise when Yelper A.K. posts photos of white walls, tablecloths, and Italian art glass; a soaring photo wall of people called \"Bob', and a spiral stair to a piano lounge perched on what looks like a cake stand on steroids.

Really? All that in an unassuming little building on Cave Creek Rd & Peoria? I've got to see this! And how did they get that second tier lounge in a one-story place?

So, in I go where, of course, there is none of this stuff. Only cold beer and mediocre food, as I'd always suspected, plus enough sports TV's to induce motion sickness. Damned peripheral vision!

And, as it turns out, A.K. was meaning to comment on \"Bobby's\" ( E Greenway), not Bobby D's on Cave Creek. I haven't let on that her review is misplaced, since it gave me a laugh.

No harm done. I stayed for a $5 fish fry and an ice cold Blue Moon, just this one time.

Oh and, the cook puts mustard in the tartar. Must have been to Kulinary Kollege."}
{"text":"Really great food at prices that will make you nervous. Don't be. 50% cheaper than you'd expect, but delicious. 12 oz. cut of prime rib for 13.95?"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with friendly staff who appreciate their regulars. The food is delicious, I definitely recommend the cheese curds. I'm a Wildcat (University of Arizona) fan and they played all of the PAC12 games, which is hard to find in Phoenix. I recommend this place as a laid back, relaxed bar with great food."}
{"text":"A rare lunch at a bar during the day. I could not drink due to work, but plenty of other regulars were enjoying a beverage about 2pm ish midweek. This is a dive bar of course and its dark and gloomy inside, but all the necessary bar ingredients are present. The friendly older female bartender and the owner who was cooking and their merry band of daytime regulars. The menu is not rocket science and I ended up going with the slider special, which included three sliders with cheese and onions and a hot portion of steak fries or whatever usual side you want. It was only $5.95 and well worth it for the money. The DBacks are probably always going to be on the tube and it's more of a neighborhood bar obviously than a destination bar, but it worked out well on my pass through town."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood dive (in the good way)! Everyone's a local, friendly, and the service is like family. 1st and 2nd visits were both fun, and delicious! VERY reasonably priced, too. Perfect for bar food and a couple drinks while watching the game or just playin' the jukebox.(TouchTunes). Lots of TV's for the Sunday football, too... not a bad seat in the house... though a couple could use some more cushin' for my flat butt. ;) Definitely get the potatoes with peppers and onions with your breakfast of choice. They were great with the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs, yum!"}
{"text":"The two bar tenders I have meet are amazing. Fair price on food and drinks. Fun local place. wish they would bring back poker!!"}
{"text":"I need to make it a priority to go here more.  Usually duck in with the wife once a month or so, more often during football season.  We often stop by with the intention of hanging out for an hour or so and usually wind up closing the place down.  The staff is awesome, great people.  Drinks aren't very expensive, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that this place has the best wings in town.  Major plus that they upgraded the TVs before the 2014 football season."}
{"text":"One year, by matter of coincidence, I was in Bobby D's for a drink after work on St. Patrick's day and I couldn't help but notice the steady stream of neighborhood folk coming in for take out corned beef and cabbage. 

This year, I enlisted a coworker to accompany me and bear witness to the fact that it was NOT a liquid lunch so I could see what the fuss was about! (It is a workday, after all!) 

For $7.95 you get a platter full of well-seasoned, fork-tender corned beef, at least a quarter of a boiled cabbage, cooked carrots and potatoes. A small plate featuring creamy horseradish, horseradish and spicy mustard was delivered with our meal. Corned beef sliders were another option ($5.95), although we took the traditional route. 

While the flavor on the corned beef was excellent (we detected a hint of cinnamon), the veggies lacked seasoning. 

Other fun facts about what you can find at Bobby D's: 
~ Lots of neighborhood peeps sportin' their green on St. Patty's 
~ TVs -- I got to watch a little of the NCAA tournament during lunch! 
~ $1 vodka soaked gummy bears (an interesting novelty in which I did not indulge)"}
{"text":"So I go to eat at a recommended place and they are closed for lunch and only open for dinner....one of the owners friends tells me about Bobby D's. 

Bobby D's is a HOLE-IN-THE-WALL bar on Peoria and Cave Creek. It is near a Circle K and is very plain on the outside. 

Once your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see a GREAT bar. It is a total local's place. There were 10 people @ the bar either eating, drinking, or talking. There is about 15 booths and about 10 TV's. They have a video bowling machine and a dart machine. The place is very very clean.

I asked what was better the burger or the fish. Barb, who might as well be your Aunt Barb, was really cool and sat down with me to take the order. 

She said the burgers are good but are premade. She never had the fish but just served two sandwhiches today. 

I ordered the fish, it was a single peice of white fish, about 7 inches long. It came with cole slaw and tater wedges. The fish was good, although not enough meat. The frys were really good. and the cole slaw was ok. 

The bill was $7.25 and I was satisfied. 

They serve Coke products and no Mt Dew. 1/2 point deduction...haha"}
{"text":"Bobby D's. Oh my what can I say about you? Except that I LOVE YOU! 

Cheap drinks, jukebox filled with awesomeness, darts, video games, lots of tv's to watch the games on, amazing food (try the salad with grilled chicken you won't regret it), amazing staff (Barb is the best), the regualrs are super friendly, its a mix of young and old, and atmosphere is super relax.

Oh Bobby D's you're a little hole in the wall but you're one of my favorites and I wouldn't change a thing about you."}
{"text":"Dive bar for sure, but clean with good food at great prices ... you can't beat the simple breakfast, fresh, tasty and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Neighborhood bar and grill.  Food is good homestyle and very well priced.    Comfy reminds one of \"Cheers\" in that great place for regulars and neighbors.   Specials such as Fried chicken dinner, Friday fish fry, spaghetti night but you should ask.  (oh and their mashed potatoes not from a box and great)  Great inexpensive breakfast on Sunday morning.  Serves until 10 PM most nights.  Met a woman from Chicago,picking up wings to bring back to Chicago because they were better than she could get in Chicago.... They are that good.

Oh.... and there is an area a bit away from the bar if you want to bring a child"}
{"text":"This is always consistently good.  The only thing I was ever disappointed with was the fried chicken I had a while ago.  The 'burger and the skinny fries are excellent.  My wife and I usually go for their grilled wings and house salad.  I think they currently have the best wings.  You won't find larger wings or better tasting.  Their salmon was only okay.  For the price and the quality of the food this place is hard to beat.  They just need to go hi-def with their satellite service."}
{"text":"Great place to go for NO nonsense drink prices and good quality bar food...and the steaks aren't bad either!

Lots of HD TVs for all of your sporting needs too!"}
{"text":"Perfect neighborhood bar. Great prices, and friendly bartenders. Love this place! I've only lived in this neighborhood for about 3 years, and we always feel welcome."}
