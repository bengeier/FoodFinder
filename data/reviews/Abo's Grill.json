{"text":"Went back 2nd time very good again my date had the Salmon I had a meatball  Calzone great sauce  will be back"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat in the area. The family that own/operates is always friendly and goes out of the way to say hello and ask about the beer selection and menu. The sandwiches are great, the pizza is phenomenal. The atmosphere is also amazing, everything is brand new and very original."}
{"text":"Third visit - wonderful service and excellent food! We  love love the pizza! Tried  one of the specialty pizza Amazing! The food and salads are well worth the travel time! Great place for dinner and a drink! Can hardly wait to come back for the lasagna."}
{"text":"This is a great pizza, calzone, and pasta place. They have wonderful drinks and food made from scratch served by a friendly and caring staff. Definitely worth checking out! The patio is an excellent summer feature!"}
{"text":"The service was great! We started with $1 meatballs, which were delicious. We ordered the white pizza. The crust was buttery and so good. It is definitely our new pizza go to."}
{"text":"My wife and I watched this place being constructed over the summer and stopped in on Friday evening. Great friendly space. It became even more appealing when I asked, \"Whose Nonna supplied the Lasagna recipe?\" and the girl behind the bar answered \"Mine\". We will always choose local family businesses over chains so this one goes to the top of the list. Her brother, who runs the kitchen, introduced himself to us as did her father.   As crazy as it sounds when it first comes out of your mouth, the chicken salad sandwich made with peanut butter and cranberries was absolutely amazing. (Sorry for you loss peanut allergy sufferers). Plenty of interesting beers on tap and the rest of the menu is definitely worth cutting a swath through.   We will definitely be back and look forward to the summer when, because we live in the neighborhood, we can walk there and enjoy the planned patio."}
{"text":"Great Place!  I live in the neighborhood and have wanted to stop in for some time now.  Last Friday I stopped in for a nightcap on my way home.  I sat at the bar, ordered my drink and struck up a conversation with the bartender.  I was glad to find out it was a family business.  I prefer to frequent the \"mom & pop shops\" rather than the chains.  She showed me a menu and I noticed several things I wanted to try.  I ended up ordering a pizza to take home.  For me....I judge pizza not only how it is when it's hot....but also how it is the next morning when it's cold.  I happen to like cold pizza.  This pizza was the best I've had in a long time.....both hot and fresh....and cold the next day.  I will definitely be going back for more and to try some other things on the menu.  I'm glad they're close by."}
{"text":"My party of 4 stopped in for dinner on a Wednesday night.  This is a new restaurant and this was our first visit.  We all agreed that Abo's was a good choice.  The food was fresh and hot and the services was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Chicken parm sandwich was excellent and I love the eggplant fries. Nice decor and family friendly. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Pasta, pizza, hamburgers and salads and more. I had the Chicken Michelina: pasta deliciously seasoned with EVOO and garlic juxtaposed to a scrumptious chicken breast with melted cheese sitting on a bed of spinach . Quite different than what I might make at home. The staff are warm welcoming,  friendly and attentive. And they have the whole menu available for carry out! We'll be back soon.The pizza looked great and I'll have to try it. And the desserts (we skipped) looked great."}
{"text":"Ordered a Veggie and Pepperoni pizza for pick up.  Veggie is LOADED! Crust is on the thin side which was fine as my family prefers it this way.  The pizza's have  the potential of being really good but there was virtually NO sauce. :(  We will try again and I'll request heavy sauce and see what happens."}
{"text":"I ride Mayfield Road daily for my job and how in the world did I miss this....I don't know maybe because it just opened about 2 months ago......but I tried it out Monday 12/28/15 and I love it.....the place is just right....not to big and not to small....the set up is nice.....I tried for starters the Limoncello Martini....it was absolutely deelish and the the eggplant fries with melted cheese and pepperoni chips along with the kale salad, stuffed peppers, and calamari were good as well.  For a first timer I will definitely be back to the quaint Italian restaurant and you should give them a try too.....I think you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"4 of us ate dinner the Wed night before Thanksgiving. There was a good sized crowd and it was pretty noisy. There's a very nice beer selection and many wines to choose from as well. 3 of us ordered the the veal and pasta. For me, the taste was way too garlicky but not everyone agreed. In fact from dish to dish the garlic taste varied. We also had lasagna which had a delicious sauce but tasted like it was all sauce and cheese-not the hearty noodley texture I'm used to. The service was good and the owner was always available and chatting people up. We didn't love our meals but we're willing to give Abo's another chance, maybe for their pizza next time."}
{"text":"Love the the eggplant fries! The waitress was very nice and attentive. The moment we walked in we felt comfortable.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friends and I tired this place for this first time and none of us were very impressed with the food. Service was great. Clean inside however very noisy due to high ceilings and concrete floors. They need to add some acoustical panels!  We ordered veal, cavatelli, chicken Michelina dish, calamari and arancini. The only thing we enjoyed was the arancini. The calamari you can tell it was frozen, the breading fell right off.   The pasta sauce had no flavor, the veal parm wasnt really flavored well and nothing was seasoned properly. Overall, food not great!"}
{"text":"Pizza=awesome  Calzone=awesome Gnocchi= exceptional Mussels=pass  Great atmosphere.  Very good server"}
{"text":"No complaints about anything here. The decor is very cool and you can tell they paid attention to every little detail and spent some real money on it --- so it's not the typical Mayfield area bar that are all either bad sports bars or gross dive bars. The layout was ideal for a half restaurant/half bar type of place. It had a big U-shaped bar that seats probably around 25 (?), and 3 huge flat screen TVs. The staff were all extremely friendly (AND competent!) and easy to talk to. Great menu. The food was as good as you'll get anywhere in the area. We had the white pizza and it was superb. We also had some meatballs (on sale: $1 per meatball), and those too were great. They also have a solid selection of craft beers that they said will continuously change each season or so. I would definitely go here again and also recommend Abo's Grill to my friends."}
{"text":"Me and my friend stopped for dinner on a Friday night! The atmosphere is very warm and inviting, love the decor. It is a little loud, I don't know if it has something to do with the high ceilings. The noise level wasn't a deal breaker and definitely wouldn't stop me from returning! The tables are really cool!!   The staff was very friendly and attentive. We ordered a bottle of prosecco. And for food We ordered the arancini (spelling?) and provolone wedges for appetizers! And then had the mad mushroom pizza! So delicious! For the two of us our bill was $60. I didn't think that was unreasonable at all!   Cannot wait to go back! So excited to support a new local business in the area!"}
{"text":"This is high-end food for a decent price. I live in New York City and my parents took me here because I loved the pizza they ordered last week, and I was so impressed with our dishes at the restaurant. I had the scallops special which were cooked perfectly and the presentation was beautiful. This is a place to take out-of-towners and pizza snobs. A great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Abos signifies the difference between chain and local resturaunts. They treat you extremely well here and make you feel at home. Every time we've eaten here the food has been exceptional. Great place for a date too!  We've also order pizza for pickup a few times and have really enjoyed the BBQ chicken. This place is a local staple"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best Italian food around! Highly recommend the Carbonara!"}
{"text":"Great family owned place. Everything is good! Especially the specialty pizza's. Pastas are great too! Support local business and give this place a try."}
{"text":"The owner is very weird. He will smile at you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable. Food and service is average. All of my family's meals were bland. Very boring atmosphere for a restaurant"}
{"text":"Great place, drove past and did not know what to expect. Great menu with a lot of Italian favorites and all made from scratch. The owner came and greeted us and told us about the place, food and was very welcoming.  Outdoor patio and comfortable inside seating. TVs to watch sports, happy hour M-F and carry out available.   Shared the homemade wedding soup, just as good as moms and chicken parm, excellent. Can't wait to have some pizza and pasta next time.  We will be back.  Several craft beers on tap major plus."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great place. Affordable prices on food and drinks. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"A big surprise! I thought this was a Mexican restaurant, and thanks to Yelp, had an excellent Italian lunch. The side salad was flavorful with a really good dressing. My friend had the Eggplant Parmigiana, and greatly enjoyed it. I ordered Nonna's Lasagna. Noodles made by the owner's mother, and sausage, instead of ground beef, made for a delicious combination. Both portions were big enough to bring half home for dinner.   For dessert, I ordered the cannoli, and received three crispy, tasty treats. Yum!   The only slight problem: the server seemed inexperienced, forgetting to ask if we wanted coffee with dessert, and less than attentive. But that didn't detract for the goodness of the food. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place given that it has been open for a year.  Pizza was not good... not much flavor.  There was only one other table in there during weekday lunch time which can't be a good sign.  The rest of the menu looks pretty good but the pizza turned me off and therefore I don't have the curiosity to find out if the rest of the food is good."}
{"text":"Just an odd place. Not sure what is wants to be. Food was decent. Decor was nonexistent. Watched a party walk in, they were never greeted, they stood there a minute and left and the place was NOT busy!! Saw, what we assumed was the owner, sitting at the bar. Never approached us."}
{"text":"I'd heard the food was good, so we stopped in for lunch to check the place out, as i am supercritical of Italian food.   We ordered eggplant parmesian sandwich, kale salad, and calamari.  All were well executed, with nuanced flavors and nice presentation.  So many more specials and menu items that I'll be back to try!"}
{"text":"Went on Saturday night. Place brand new. Nice decor. Good waitress and service. Bread very good. Calzone very good and large. Great price $6 plus $1 each item. Too much for one person. My only other food comment would be that the sauce wasn't very flavorful. I told the owner as he was circulating around the dining room asking everyone about their food. He was very attentive to my comment and was sincere. I would go back and try pizza next time. Prices are good but he has lots of competition for italian on mayfield."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! A great place to go for a nice dinner or casually stop by.  Enjoyable atmosphere and reasonable prices!  A nice change from the other options around! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place that I frequent quite often. Every time I've been there, the service was great! The food is always on point. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a newer spot in our neighborhood and we drove past it many times before finally checking it out.  It wasn't crowded So we were allowed to choose our seat.  It's not a large place but they do have a nice size patio which will be helpful during the summer months.  They have a 4 hour happy hour from 3pm-7pm which is well worth it and includes wine and beer.  However, the happy hour does not include food. Just FYI.  Our waitress was nice and attentive. The manager walked around checking with every table to make sure they were okay.  We tried the eggplant pizza fries as an appetizer and split the Stromboli. The pizza fries were better than I thought, and they were not stingy with the toppings.  The Stromboli was Great and it's enough to share, depending on your appetite. We also tried the calzone.  The calzone was also a huge portion and could be shareable. The calzone was great and the dough was the best part, very fresh. However, I think next time I'll ask them to add pepperoni, I failed to read that it did not include meat.  But that's my fault ! Very worthwhile spot to try!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Lyndhurst and the greater Cleveland area. Incredible atmosphere and food. Ordered the pizza fries and chicken Parmesan and was blown away. This place knows how to make great Italian food and has excellent service. Can't wait to try the pizza next time I visit. Btw there is a separate room for the multiple cheesecake options. You heard me right. A dessert room."}
{"text":"Can't wait to actually have their food next time!! Stopped In with my boyfriend for a quick drink and the owner (I believe) took the time to show us their featured menu items (their grandma makes their lasagna homemade everyday!) and even let us try their wings which were the real deal and amazing! Can't wait to go back for the pasta!!"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Sat outside in the back patio with a view of their garden.   Food was expertly cooked. Veal Marsala was best I ever had. Pizza fries was legitimately the best way I've ever had eggplant. They truly value the quality of ingredients the use.   They really deserve the patronage. We will be back just to hang and to make this a sports watch spot."}
{"text":"I am literally sitting in this establishment right now. I wanted to walk up to the bar for a drink/take out, I attempt to order a corona and lime and he guy is holding my \"cold\" beer for like 5 min while he is talking to the staff in uniform. I don't know if he is the owner or manager by his guy can give me my damn drink and continue his staff meeting later. I was going to order food but screw that guy and his place. The pizza looked burnt when I saw a couple at the bar eating it."}
{"text":"My sister and I just happened to stop at Abo's Grill last Saturday and had no idea how awesome our experience would be!  We loved our entrees and our dessert!  The presentation of the food equally match how delicious everything was.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My friend Marilyn and I checked out this place the other day for lunch. The parking lot was empty except for their catering van making me think they were closed. Thankfully they were not. I will never understand why some places just don't catch on. The food is great. The waitstaff is wonderful. Everything works and yet the place isn't clicking. The waitress informed me the place had been open for two years which really surprised me because I honestly thought it had just opened. I think the place needs a cosmetic makeover and perhaps with that and some ads on TV the word will finally get out there because this is a very special establishment. I am Jewish-Sicilian and getting really good Jewish or Sicilian food is becoming more and more difficult after one chain after another completely eradicates any genuine sense of self. Sure the Olive Garden isn't bad, but it's not like the Italian restaurants that my family used to go to when I was a kid. The Spaghetti Company on Som was always a treat. When the waitress mentioned that all of the food was homemade I became very excited because homemade is not a word you hear these days. I ordered the Mingucci Grinder which is 3 house made meatballs in a toasted hoagie bun with sausage, cheese and marinara sauce. It is a huge portion and all for $9. When it came out I could immediately tell the waitress wasn't kidding when she said homemade. You can just tell a homemade meatball from some frozen aberration that a restaurant tries to pass off as \"homemade.\" I actually said to the waitress that I felt like there had to be an Italian grandmother in the kitchen because these meatballs tasted just like the ones my own grandma Sophie would make when we'd go there for Sunday dinners. And surprise there really is an Italian grandmother who does come and offer her expertise. Her name is Nana and I am not kidding in the least little bit when I say change the name to Nana's and make her the face of the place because I guarantee once that happens this restaurant will find itself hopping and will become a destination for anyone and everyone who is seeking a truly spot on Italian joint that is all about making you feel like you're home again. Marilyn had the Stromboli and also commented on how out of this world the meatballs are. I cannot wait to go back and try their pizza and their desserts. Honestly I want to try everything on their menu because it all sounds so yummy. Mangia tutti!"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing!!! Chicken Parm sandwich is Ridiculously Good! words can't describe how delicious this sandwich was! We also enjoyed pizza and salad as well, the only thing We are disappointed it's about dessert, we got the tiramisu and is not worth the price, We were expecting a delicious dessert for that money. Our server was nice and polite so We'll definitely recommend this place and we'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"My mom brought us here for a Friday night dinner and there was not many people here. But if you are not here then you are missing out. The happy hour specials alone are reason to come in. The meatballs here are a steal, they are fantastic and perfectly made. I personally got the Stromboli. It was amazing and very filling. The relaxing and down to earth atmosphere is amazing honestly this place is a hidden gem.  10/10"}
{"text":"Food: My husband and I have visited Abo's twice.  First time we had the Meatball Pizza.  OUTSTANDING!  Which made us return a couple months later where we both tried the calzones.  I had the vegetarian and my husband had meatball.  Again, OUTSTANDING.  The crust and sauce are amazing, and it is immediately apparent they use fresh ingredients.  Nothing comes out of a can.  If you come here, I highly recommend the pizza or calzones.  Atmosphere:  Very homey.  Small, but not cramped.  They have some tv's at the bar if you are looking to watch the game, which are easily viewable from the tables.    Service:  The owner is constantly walking around and supervising.  He is very friendly, and stops at every table to see how everything is doing.  The only con is they don't really have a host/hostess, and there isn't really an entryway when you walk in, so it can get confusing if you should wait to be seated or seat yourself.  And if you have to wait, it is very cramped by the door.  Also, both times we have gone it takes a bit for a server to come to your table and for them to come back.  I think since they are newer they are still a bit short staffed and are still working out the kinks.  So it's something they need to work on, but it didn't ruin our dining experience."}
{"text":"I went to Abo's Grill this past Saturday night, 4/8/17.  I got there around 8pm and there was a nice crowd.  I was by myself so chose to sit at the bar.  I was immediately approached by Joe who took my drink order immediately.  He then handed me the menu and then explained the specials.  The best part about the specials was that he literally had pictures of what it was and how it looked (Cod, short rib, mussels)!  I thought that was a very nice touch and I saw him do that with others. They are also serving a Lobster Mac and Cheese that won the \"Best of\" in Philadelphia not to long ago.  I decided that I wanted to have an Italian meal, so I started off with the meatball appetizer.  Dear God 3 meatballs the perfect size in a beautiful blush sauce that had small drops of balsamic reduction.  I honestly think they were the best meatballs I ever ate.  I chose my entrée to be the Gnocchi.  Best damn choice.  They were so light and the sauce again, a light white cream sauce - TO DIE FOR.  As I was eating, a very nice man came over to ask me how everything was - turns out he was the owner and his name was Sam.  I told him how wonderful everything was and he explained to me that the reason the gnocchi was so light was because they are made with Ricotta Cheese and are not dough based.  Seriously, so damn good my stomach wants to go there again just typing this.  I wish this restaurant the best and highly recommend it to others!  The owner built it from the ground up and the atmosphere is so relaxed.  Very comfortable.  Especially for those who dine alone!  Like me!  Give them a try - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I am not sure where some of these reviews are coming from, oh yeah most of the \"love this placers\" have no other reviews, but they love abos. Are you kidding?  Been there twice and never again.  Odd vibe to say the least, weird, private club like and the decor?  There is something going on here. Food?  Acted like they were doing you a favor and the food was not good."}
{"text":"This is a new neighborhood favorite. For the entrees, we have only stuck to the pizza and calzones, both of which are delicious! We have to order extra of their homemade marinara it is so good. We like coming up here for a drink and a casual meal.   The veggie calzone is awesome! It wasn't watery like some veggie calzones. The crust is cooked perfectly! Tonight we tried the BBQ chicken and it lived up to our expectations.  We are excited to come up here one weekend when the weather is nice to be able to use the patio."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with a great atmosphere. It mixes bar and food and environment in even portions. The food is great and the service is pleasant.  The tables are themselves are unique and there is not too many tables so the place feels intimate.  A great place to eat and a good place to meet friends."}
{"text":"Good food , kids friendly , great service, the manager was just walking around and checking with customers satisfaction  We got the steak and chicken tender that was recommended by server, the price for chicken tenders with fries was only $6  The steak was $17, although small , good enough for one hungry person and well-done  We love the environment also"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many times, glad I finally gave it a try. Had the pizza fries as an appetizer, then the chicken salad sandwich for my meal. The sandwich was incredible, had a lot of unique ingredients that I wasn't expecting at all. After my meal I was easily convinced to buy a piece of peanut butter cup cheesecake. I'm excited to go back to Abo's to try the pizza since everyone was raving about it!"}
{"text":"Great service and excellent pizza. Cool vibe and great atmosphere. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Last minute choice for dinner. My sister said she keeps riding by and wanted to go so we went. When we walked in the atmosphere seemed a little unwelcoming. My sister called before we went to check the hours and upon entering we were asked if we had a reservation???  So of course we didn't and we looked around at a half empty restaurant. Who we would come to learn was the owner Sam shared they would be having live entertainment later and were going to be pretty full. Sam still managed to get us a table. Same came back over and warmed up by sharing the daily and happy hour specials and chatted for a bit. We ended up ordering a couple of things from the menu. We ordered the Philly steak egg rolls which were extremely yummy. We also had Italian wedding soup, lasagna and the meatball sliders with an order of fries, all of which were good(can't really go wrong with fresh cut fries). Will go again to try more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"The food we had was fantastic, the portions were great and the plating was simple. Clean, nice place. The service was non existent. I think the owner lets his nieces work there without food service training.  The bar is the weirdest shaped bar I've ever seen, not to mention you could park a tractor trailer behind it and the employees would still have room to walk around it. If you added up all the \"behind the bar\" space in all of the bars in the state of Ohio, Abo's would still have more space. Decor? Zero."}
{"text":"Lunches at Abo's Grill today and it was delicious!  I had the BBQ chicken pizza and my lunch mates had the chicken Parmesan and calzone.  All entrees were excellent.  The pizza fries (eggplant) were also excellent!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent as well as the service. The pizza was done to perfection and the kale salad was delicious!  What a gem!"}
{"text":"To start, this place is not family friendly. They have high chairs and kids menus, but won't give them crayons or pens in fear that they might write on their cool wood tables.  Decor: Table layout is weird, only two windows in the whole place, and the fake distressed wall design is terrible.  When building from scratch, it's critical to hire a restaurant design expert for lighting, sound and visual. It feels like you got stuck in a brick prison box that serves food and drinks.  They will realize this was a cost that shouldn't have overlooked in due time.   Food/menu:  They want to be Italian, but serves non Italian food. Chicken sandwich? BLT? Grilled Cheese?  Either your Italian, or a bar and grill.  The pizza fries were good, hot peppers weren't hot and lacked flavor, chicken Parmesan and chips were fresh and a nice portion, and the beet salad was small, overpriced and lacked any creativity.  As for the server, she was sweet but nothing more then a bar server.  She had no enthusiasm about the restaurant, she didn't asked us if we had been there before, and didn't offer any suggestions as to what we should order.   The owner: He was watching tables like a hawk (which was weird), looked miserable sitting at the bar, and wasn't open to listening to constructive feedback. On the way out, we didn't get a thank you for stopping in, or we look forward to welcoming you back.  It was clear that they want drinking adults and no kids even at 5:30 on a Saturday night.    I love supporting non-chain restaurants, but this one needs Gordon Ramsey before they loose their investment."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of supporting local business, so when Abo's opened up down the street, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We were not disappointed - food, service and the owners were all great. We've been back multiple times now and have never had anything we didn't like. The philly egg rolls are fantastic and the Stromboli is ginormous - great value for the price.  Good pizza and lunch combos too!   Keep up the good work, Abo's!"}
{"text":"Nice neutral decor.  We were there on a Tuesday night, so it was fairly quiet.  The food came out hot and tasted good.  Portions were not large, but that was a nice change.  Had to ask for bread instead of it being brought automatically.  Service was excellent and very friendly.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"This is the second time I'm here great Italian food friendly service very prompt from order to getting food.  Also one of the few restaurants still open after 9:30pm  We've been to many Italian restaurants in California this one is up there with some of the best.  Will come back again on my next visit.  Their sausage penne is awesome"}
{"text":"Our group of 8 met here for dinner, and everything went well. We had a brand new waitress who did a great job. Service was bit slow, but sine two members of our group ordered pizza, which always takes a while.   I began with an appetizer of arancini which I've never seen on a menu in the US before. My only previous encounter with this food was a Mt. Etna cafeteria, so I wanted to try a good one.  I was not disappointed.  My entree was the carbonara pasta in an Alfredo sauce. I enjoyed it and had some left to take home.  My spouse had penne pasta in a marinara sauce with meatballs. He was not impressed. Those with the pizzas were pleased as was the diner with the chicken picatta.    I would be happy to return."}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite neighborhood place on \"No Cook Friday\". We've been several times and we have always enjoyed our meal. Nice, clean, contemporary atmosphere. The owner greets you as you enter and always finds time to stop by the table to talk about the specials. If the crab cakes are available, it's a must try along with the excellent clam chowder. If you are in the mood for a pizza, try the Mediterranean. It's delicious. The Chicken Piccata is listed as a chefs specialty and deserves that recommendation. All around, relaxed but attentive service and a meal you can count on to delight. Try this place out. You'll come back, I promise!"}
{"text":"Prompt service and great food. We dined during peak hours and the place was not overwhelmingly busy. Good beers on tap, we tried the \"pizza fries\" which are made from eggplant and could not have been better. I had the homemade gnocchi which was to die for, my man had the cavatelli and was a little bit disappointed in the sauce being so mild it was almost too bland to him. Overall we will be sure to visit again"}
{"text":"No great. We ordered take out and it was unsatisfactory. The chicken Parmesan was bland and the bread was burnt. We also ordered the a Caesar salad, it was very plain. Croutons, poorly chopped romaine lettuce, and Parmesan cheese that looked like the kind you shake on to pizza. The dressing tasted like it was store bought. I had very high hopes for the good but unfortunately it let us down. :("}
{"text":"It's nice to have a new Italian option close by.  I've been to Abo's four times since they opened and there are plenty of things on the menu I'd like to try.  Since they are new, I'm going to cut them a break, for now.    FOOD - 6/10: I've had the pizza on two different occasions, the cavatelli w/meat balls on another and the lasagna most recently.  The two pizzas I had (both pepperoni) came out completely different each time.  The first was delicious and crispy, the sauce was excellent.  A week later I ordered the same pizza and it was barely cooked and the sauce was way too sweet and not the same as it was the first time.  A RESTAURANT MUST HAVE CONSISTENCY!  The cavatelli w/meat balls is one of the best I've ever had.  The meat balls are out of this world!  A must have.  The lasagna tasted good, but it was overcooked on the edges and cold in the center.  Not good.  SERVICE: - 8/10: Our waitresses were very nice each time, no complaints.  My only suggestion is that it seems that there is no order to the system.  By that I mean, our waitress each time had tables on opposite ends of the room which meant they were running back and forth from end to end.  Can't they just each have a section?  VALUE:  7/10: Prices are reasonable.  The bar is huge (maybe too big) and seems to get a lot of business.  It's a shame they opened in the fall/winter and can't yet utilize the patio on the back."}
{"text":"Good food, a little in the pricey side, but would definitely come back. Here's a good idea...your parking lot is empty on a Friday evening at 4:30. How about getting together a happy hour menu, say 4-6pm with a few drinks discounted, hang a big banner across the front and see what happens?  You have a captive audience pumping gas across the street & one of the busiest streets for traffic in the state of Ohio. Just sayin..."}
{"text":"I was turned on to this place by chance.  The staff was very friendly, the service was top notch and the food was delicious.  It's been a while since I was wowed by a meal.  The meals were good portions.  I focused on pasta, my friends had seafood and eggplant. All three of us comments on the flavors and presentation. They have a small patio out back which was full, not available at the time.  Looking forward to going back and trying it out."}
{"text":"Stopped by Abo's Grill for a quick drink on their first night open. I live in the neighborhood and had been watching the building take shape for months, so I was kind of excited to see the interior.   The bar area is huge and there's a large selection of beer on tap. It takes up about half of the restaurant, but there are high top and regular tables surrounding the bar area.   The menu offers up Italian classics, salads, sandwiches, and pizza. I had other dinner plans otherwise I might have stayed and had a bite to eat. I'll definitely be back sometime soon for a drink or 5 and hopefully I'll get a chance to check out their food. (Note to my fellow vegans: there aren't many options on the menu but if you ask, it seems like the kitchen can make up something special - like a cheeseless salad or pizza)"}
{"text":"We walked in 5-20-17 around 4:30pm. Restaurant was dark, kids sleeping in two booths. Asked to sit outside, crowded , no ambiance. Decided it wasn't going to be a good experience. Left, bad first impression. We won't be back"}
{"text":"Got their meat lovers pizza. Awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and I met some East side friends here for dinner. Food was fabulous and we got to visit with the owner during our meal. We sat at the bar to watch the Indians game. He was so friendly and welcoming. Nona's lasagna...yum!  I ate the whole plate which won me a fist bump from our new owner friend!"}
{"text":"Went to Abo's earlier this week and I brought my husband back tonight.  The eggplant fries are excellent.  He had tonight's signature dish....piaya. He loved it.  The hamburger was delicious!   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the calamari and veal and the lasagna.   The calamari had a very good sweet chili sauce but the calamari itself was frozen. It seemed like they just took I tour of the pack already breaded and deep fried them.   I had the veal which came with a side of pasta. The sauce on the veal was pure garlic and raw wine. I love garlic but I am not a fan of 'let's throw some in before we serve' strength. I told the waitress about it and she offered to get me something else. As she was getting a menu, the manager came over and asked what was wrong with the dish. I told him and he got me something else. While I was waiting for my new meal the manager (owner?) came over and explained to me that the dish was just fine and that if I come back I should not order that. Implying that my taste buds and my friend's taste buds are wrong.   My new dish was the gnocchi. They were home made and were rather tasty. If you HAVE to go I'd order them.   My friend had the lasagna. The sauce was pretty good but the lasagna was 90% noodle and she was given a corner piece which was a tat burnt.   Over all not a great experience especially for being open for a few weeks. Making the customers feel like crap because their dishes  taste like crap is disrespectful. I think customers are always right is rule one in Kitchen Nightmares. Get Ready Chef Ramsay!!"}
{"text":"With wife and daughter fresh made gnocci, lasgna and a club sandwich with fresh made chips. Everything was very good and fresh made."}
{"text":"I would definitely give Abo's another try, but our first time there was a bit rough. We came in at lunch, and there were two other tables. We were presented with menus and drinks promptly, and our waitress returned to take our orders. Unfortunately, this is the last we saw of our server for quite a while, especially with so few other tables to serve. Unfortunately, when our food arrived, I was quite disappointed. The chicken parmesan was dry, as was the bread. The sauce on the side was good, but not great. The chips were great. Thin sliced, and crispy. Definitely worth a second chance."}
{"text":"pizza was very good - good crust. had pasta dish with chicken, very tasty. great service. need more of a selection."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the atmosphere is comfortable and rustic-chique, the staff is friendly, and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food, cool space, nice owner. I'm not sure why this place has any bad reviews - maybe just hiccups during its first few weeks?"}
{"text":"Chocolate cake is wonderful...get the ice cream with it. Veggie calzone was okay...a more flavor needed. Will visit again to try the eggplant."}
{"text":"The homemade pasta was delicious. The service was good and the atmosphere was excellent. There was a couple hiccups which one would expect with a new restaurant but it was clear that they are on the right track."}
{"text":"Nice little place and the food was decent. Very clean and food was presented nicely and quickly. Price point for what you get is a bit high."}
{"text":"Love the food here!! I try a different dish each time I dine, everything I have tried so far is amazing! Happy hour everyday (except sat) until 7pm love it!!! Happy that this place is just around the corner from my house. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Watched this place go up and was excited to try. Food was decent but the menu was a bit confusing. Should stick with Italian vs mix of Italian and American. Will give it another shot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Every time my wife brings someone new here they become permanent customers.    The pizza is delicious and I typically get the chicken parmigiana sandwich.  Along with Abos House salad, it's a delicious meal.  The meatballs are also good.  We really haven't had a bad meal here ever.   Ownership and service are great too!  If you're not eating here, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my son, the meatballs are the best EVER!.... come to find out it's an old family recipe!..... HIGHLY recommend this place!.... The owner is quite a personality and added to our experience!!!!!....5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"I am blown away by how I am being treated currently as a patron of this restaurant.  Right now my brother and I are the only two people here, they are open until midnight, and the waitress is trying to get us out of here.  She told us they didn't have a complete menu at first.  Then pressured us to decide what to order when we weren't sure what items we were even allowed to order.  Then finally we got our food and 3 seconds later she asked if she can take anything away from us and if we want boxes.  She was trying to hurry us out.  There was a point during the meal where I looked over in the kitchen and three employees were looking at my brother and I through the window laughing at us.  I'm not joking, the staff was clearly talking about us and looking at us bc when we looked over they all ducked out of sight.  Also, I ordered three drinks over the course of an hour and she asked me If I was driving when I ordered the third and tried to not serve me, but I was not acting the slightest bit drunk.  She was just trying to rush me out.  I'm mind blown, offended, and pissed.  I still tipped her 15% too bc I'm a nice guy, but I hope her boss sees this review and does something about how we were treated when we were the only customers there."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area! We order pizza from Tasty, Vicinatos, and Pizzazz- in addition to the chain pizza restaurants. We know pizza. Abos is just amazing. So flavorfull and fresh-tasting!   Ambiance is ok. Not a great set up if you bring a baby.   Anyways, food was really good and we will definitely be getting pizza as a carry out soon."}
{"text":"I love the pizza at Abo's. The meat and Mediterranean are favorites...especially the Mediterranean. Staff is very friendly and prices are reasonable. Highly recommend Abo's!"}
{"text":"The pizza was very good with a very crispy crust. We got the provolone app and it looked great however was not completely melted and only warm. My husband got the chicken parm sandwich which he said was \"ok\". Our server was very sweet however her language barrier made it difficult to get our needs met. She iften didn't understand what we requested. It was very clean inside and the decor nice. It is very however dark and loud inside."}
