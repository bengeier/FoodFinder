{"text":"Nice clean and delicious joint in Gay Village by Latin Quarter. Tomato Cucumber Salad is da bomb, punchy dressing with great flavor, don't miss it. BaBa is delish, but not to smokey style I'm used to. Staff were welcoming and helpful. 

This is in the running for my favorite Lebanese fast food place."}

{"text":"This place opened 1 month ago and it caught my eye when I was searching on yelp. Just ate here today and the shush taouk was amazing, the chicken and beef was very well flavoured, price was friendly along with portions. For the chicken I will give this place a 5/5 stars, the beef was quality by I believe it was steak beef so slightly fatty. Overall, very clean place and all renovated. The lady was friendly as well :). 

Hope this place can always stay the same!

Will be going back"}
{"text":"Got a late night shawarma here. I was drunk and still wasn't impressed-- food's always supposed to be good when drunk! Don't get me wrong though, I did finish it, lol. I just don't plan to come back. In fact, we left here to go to mcdonalds so that we could end the night satisfied..."}
