{"text":"This is our favorite weekend breakfast place. the food is always good and the wait staff is always pleasant. When they are swamped sometimes the srvice is delayed but ,ost of the time you get your order within a few minutes."}
{"text":"Johnny Ks is a nice choice for a solid homestyle country breakfast.  It's always the same and it's always just fine for a great price and excellent service, it's a good option.  I'm not a huge fan of their lunch or dinner, it's not that it's bad, but there are better options.  Also, it's a great place to bring little ones.  With friendly and fast service...it always go smoothly."}
{"text":"i've been trying to find a little town diner for sometime now. I think I've found it!
Nothing spectacular just plain simple, good service, good food. They way these 
little places should be. If you want gourmet go into Charlotte."}
{"text":"Everything thing about this place is good. Don't let the outer appearance fool you. This is definitely a diamond in the rough. Good food good service. 5"}
{"text":"Finally found a good ole \"Meat in 3's\" place with one of the best Fried Okras I've had in a long time.  Thank you, \"P\" for recommending the Beef Tips over Rice with Grilled Onions and Green Peppers!  It was really good.  My co-worker had the Fried Flounder and also enjoyed the meal.  The meals and service was definitely worth the trip from Uptown, especially having to go through Independence."}
{"text":"I would feel bad writing this review if I thought it would have any impact on Johnny K's business, but since I'm almost certain that no one who frequents here reads Yelp, or gives a damn what we say, I'll carry on.  Having now eaten here 4-5 times, I think I can give it an honest shake. Everything is clean and the service is always good, which is why I threw in the 3rd star, And the lady who owns it with her husband is always super nice.  As for the food, it's just your typical meat and potatoes type joint run by a hard working Greek family in the South.  A bit too greasy, and a bit too much butter on everything, but always served with a smile and always pretty cheap.  There are places I prefer in the area, but when my clients want to eat here, I'm cool with obliging them."}
{"text":"Johnny K's was meh. I went there for weekend breakfast and it was about half full inside. The food came out quick but the results were below what I would expect even from a greasy spoon place. Terrible biscuits and the sausage gravy was yucky. The server was very unfriendly although the ladies at the front counter were nice. They did cook my eggs correctly but thats about it."}
{"text":"Good food, came out quickly, good price. I got the deuces for $8? Kept my coffee full and hot the entire hour I was here. 

Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful breakfast this morning. They were busy but Jen and Dina took good care of us. Waffle and eggs were perfect  my son had a great time. Thanks"}
{"text":"there are lots of family-style, \"southern cooking\" places like this in the area and Charlotte metro in general.... this wasn't much different, but was overall very unimpressive. food was kinda blah, not horrible but nothing fantastic. limited choices and frankly ugly atmosphere. went with a group of 6 people and probably half of us were less than thrilled with our food. the server was friendly and quick (there were no other people in the place when we went though, so that's not saying much). overall, it's just ok. I wouldn't recommend it if you have options, and I won't suggest it as a place for us to go again, but I wouldn't protest if I was with someone who really wanted to go there.
I do want to point out we were there for dinner on New Year's Day. we often drive by and see tons of cars in the lot during breakfast and lunch times, so it's apparently popular."}
{"text":"I have been to Johnny K's twice and they were night and day visits. Our waitress could give cared less to be at work or to wait on us she was rude. We bothered her to take our drink order, she brought us soup and then stood there not saying a word so I assume we are supposed to order now? All 3 of us ordered side salad and all of us got brown lettuce 2 chunks of tomato and a ton of onion saddest salad I've ever seen. What restaurant that wants return customers to serve them brown lettuce. I got chicken tips the same thing I got last time, and last time they were juicy and delicious today cold, flavorless, dry, and had chunks of fat still on them. The okra was great! My mom and aunt both got the fried chicken, which was good. We had to track the waitress down for refills and anything else we needed she did not ask us one time if we needed anything a refill, nothing UGH! I won't be back anytime soon and everyone in the party agreed."}
{"text":"Went there around 9:30 on a Monday and the place was near empty.....thought that was a bad sign.....but no.   Food was great and I left stuffed.   Diner like place.  Decor just ok...but what do you want??!   If you want a great b-fast.....give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place - the type of place that gives you what you'd come for - good home, good service, good price. Can't wait to come back for lunch. Very large place - and somewhat full of mostly locals I'd guess - all good signs you are in the right place!"}
{"text":"Good diner food. Ate there for breakfast and the spinach and feta omelette was terrific. The hash browns were not though. Clearly frozen and very pasty. Service was great and very quick."}
{"text":"Had lunch here Saturday, it is definitely a cute homey family place.  I ordered the philly cheesesteak and my friend ordered the club sandwich.  His sandwich was beautiful and wow huge, he said some of the bacon was a touch undercooked tho.  

My sweet and hilarious waitress put my sandwich down and asked 'does everything look ok?'  To which I replied, 'maybe I didnt order the black hair on the pickle'.  Since I am blonde and she was blonde I could see the wheels sputtering in her head there was no way to get out of this one.  So I helped her out and handed her the pickle, suggesting I really did not want a replacement.  Ug, so I am not a kid and I realize that cooks making probably minimum wage are not donning hazmat suits to prepare a meal for Princess Melissa or any other paying member of society....so I let it go...I know it just happens.  I picked carefully through the rest of my sandwich tho...  The coleslaw was fabulous, the KFC kind that is a little sweet and finely chopped.  

All in all I would say this restaurant is \"meh' and definitely has overtones of creepy cousin-in-law who is always asking me to go to a strip-joint with him when I go home for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Family environment and friendly wait staff. Love bringing my family here for breakfast. Such a great place in Indian trail nc"}
{"text":"I feel bad for writing this review but I'm also sorry for the meal I just endured at Johnny K's.  I've eaten there before and thought nothing of it: not good, not bad. Today, the service was excellent like always but the food was AWFUL! Definitely some cost cutting in the food department which is sad because the place was PACKED. 

A few of  the items we wanted were out or no longer being served...brunch on a Sunday. Really!?! Okra was overdone, Country-Style Steak was none of the above but rather a chuckwagon-quality \"beef\" patty drowning in gravy.  It was so offensive to eat that my brain won't let me stop reliving the nightmares of each bite. 

My mom couldn't cook either but she was mom and we learned to stomach some awful food growing up. I found a place worse than mom's."}
{"text":"This had become a weekend ritual breakfast place for our family until today. My boyfriend and I went for breakfast, was seated in the far back booth and while looking over the menu, I saw an ant on the table. No big deal, I got rid of it but then to my surprise there were more coming from behind the sugar container, ketchup bottle and all over the jelly packets. We then noticed them on the booth itself. We normally would have left however since we never encountered an issue like this before we asked if we could move seats. While sitting in the other booth the staff members began to clean the previous booth. 

The waitress felt bad and did not make us pay for our $2.00 toast order. When at the register the management staff didn't apologize or even mention the bug incident. Any other restaurant would have had the management come over while we were still in the booth and apologize and probably would have given us our breakfast for free. I don't care that we had to pay, after all we decided to stay HOWEVER I'm extremely shocked that the owner did not apologize to us. For this reason alone, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Not the best place around for this type of food and price. Atmosphere is shaky and doesn't have that diner feel I'm looking for."}
