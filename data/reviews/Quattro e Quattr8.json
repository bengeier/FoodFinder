{"text":"AMAZING!!!

You know those times when in you're in a different area, either for shopping or any other reason and you and your partner are hungry? You elect to try a new restaurant and hope for the best. Well we walked into Quattro e Quatro8 and all I can say - now we'll be looking for any excuse to go back. Incredible Italian food only surpassed by the service and ambiance. You could taste the love at every level. It's no surprise the pizza is amazing...not when you make the dough from scratch and pay attention to every detail that makes traditional Italian pizza the best in the world. But when the mussels arrived, we were blown away. Huge in size and grander in taste. The broth alone was a gastronomic delight, which we enjoyed immensely by dipping the homemade pizza bread into it. We'd go back just for the mussels!...let alone the pizza or the service in this quaint & charming atmosphere.

Only having scratched the tip of the menu - we will be frequenting this gem for a long time to come. Special thanks to our server Elle who made our first visit an incredible experience. Heck, she made our day! And Karina too - talented matriarch and kind hostess and partner with Alexandro - the two talented entrepreneurs who conceived this stand-out restaurant.

Ci vediamo (see you soon) Quattro e Quattr8...is a delicious Dieci. 10!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried anything but the take-out pizza slices, but they are incredibly good. I mean it... they're among the best I've *ever* had, and they're not expensive at all. I'm amazed that there are so few people here at lunchtime, while at the mediocre chains like Pizzaiolo there are lines of customers waiting to get bland slices with around 2 pieces of pepperoni per portion. The staff are also wonderfully friendly."}
{"text":"Tried having dinner here today...sat for about 10 minutes and no one approached us, despite trying to get the server's attention (server was in deep conversation with an individual who appeared to be a friend)."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza with excellent topping ingredients. I highly recommend this place for lunch or dinner. Quick, easy and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant, nice addition to the neighbourhood. They offer Italian \"street food\" - small plates.  We just stopped into the lobby for a slice of take out pizza while out for a walk, and the pizza was great. It's \"Roman style\" with a thicker crust than a Neapolitan pizza and quite fresh. I had broccoli and sausage (which is better than it sounds) and my partner had eggplant and tomato sauce. The dining room has a funky casual vibe, and there is a nice bar too. Seems like it would be a fun spot to experiment with Italian food in a new way, with sharing small plates.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"It is very hard to distinguish between all of the Italian/pizza places in Yonge and Eglinton so when a new addition opened for business, it didn't seem like anything new. Quattro e Quattr8 replaced Falasca (the pizza by weight place) and has maintained the pizza take-out but no longer by weight ($4.50 per slice). They have also made a tapas and pizza restaurant on the other side which has specials such as half price pizza on Tuesdays and 50% off wines on Wednesdays. The tapas range from $8 - 15 dollars and are exactly what you'd expect of a tapa - small plates. Overall, I really liked their eggplant tapa and also the pizza with 3 types of mushrooms. 

TL;DR Went in with low expectations, it met my expectation. Get pizza on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This place has the same owner as the gelato store across the street. 

I come here from North York just to have a meal here followed up by a gelato from across the street. 

I come here for:

Great food
Great service
Stylish yet not obnoxious 
Has a small patio area
Lunch specials- $15 for a pizza, house wine and salad

The pizzas are delicious!

{"text":"Walked by and decided to give it a try. It's a small but warm atmosphere, very 'family owned and operated' vibe. The young lady that served us was very sweet and attentive.

The plates are on the smaller side and it's definitely recommend to have about 3-4. The stuffed olives were so fantastic, I had to stop myself from making a 2nd order. The spaghetti  carbonara was creamy and just the right portion.

We'll definitely be coming back in future."}
{"text":"I've walked by Quattro e Quattr8 so many times over the last year that it seemed inevitable I'd finally walk in one of these days.

We stopped by around 7:00 on a Friday night and sat in the almost empty patio, where our waitress quickly brought us menus and some water.

We elected to start with an order of Suppli (classic Roman tomato & fior di latte rice ball). I'll be honest and say this didn't exactly blow me away. The restaurant's take on arancini contained mushy rice, a fairly bland tomato sauce, and a very tiny amount of cheese. It was edible, sure, but not the best way to start out the meal.

Faring far better was the main course, All'Amatriciana (spicy tomato sauce, crunchy pork cheek & sprinkled w/pecorino cheese. Mandatory served w/Bucatini). The dish, which annoyingly arrived a few minutes before my dining partner's main, does indeed boast an irresistibly spicy sauce that's augmented with slices of pork cheek. (Said slices were not even remotely crunchy, however.) Bucatini remains one of my least favorite pastas just because it's so difficult to twirl, but it worked fine in this dish.

I suppose I'd be willing to return to Quattro e Quattr8, but given that it's located in an area teeming with Italian restaurants, they should probably up their game if they want to stay competitive."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch and was actually planning to just go for a pizza slice or two. However, the waitress that seated us described the lunch specials and it sounded really nice that I decided to try that instead.  The special consisted of gnocchi followed by a piece of veal cooked gremolata style and roasted potatoes. My friend ordered pasta with Ndjua sausage. 
To start with, the gnocchi was very floury and just got stuck in the gum and the tomato  sauce it was tossed in did not add much flavour. So this did not really do anything for me. What raised the rating to a three star was the gremolata style veal, which was very nice, lemony and fresh. My friend's Ndjua pasta was very flavourful but a bit spicy. 
To sum up:

+ Good gremolata style veal
+ Good portion size for the lunch special
+ They have two different portion sizes: half and full so you can choose how much you want to eat
+ Friendly staff

- Bad gnocchi 
+ Half portion size is very small for the price you pay"}
{"text":"As Christopher C. mentioned, it's all small plates of Italian street food.  This is a unique menu and definitely worth trying.  With most Italian places you pretty well know what's going to be on the menu.  Here, a lot of pleasant surprises.  Loved the fried mozzarella balls.  And for dessert the cooked apple slices were light and tasty.  The interior is much more welcoming than Falasca, the predecessor.  We'll be back."}
