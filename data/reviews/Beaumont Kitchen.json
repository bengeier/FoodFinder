{"text":"I've been to this restaurant too many times to count now because we live nearby and it never disappoints.

The staff are warm and attentive, the ambience is relaxed and it never gets too loud on a busy Friday or Saturday night or during the Sunday brunch crowd - you can always have nice and pleasant conversation without loud thumping music or having to scream above other patrons.  I had dinner last night (a Wednesday night) and though it was busy (they had a huge group sitting), it was still as relaxing, peaceful and enjoyable as all of my other visits.  

The decor is modern chic with a relaxed flair - completely beautiful.  It might appear pretentious to some, but the amazing, friendly staff have always consistently made me feel warm and welcome (I never once experienced attitude by anyone).

I was also there last Friday and was served by the same server, Katie, who was just as attentive, friendly and warm.

Because I'm a regular, I've tried a lot of different things (but not everything because to keep things fresh and moving, they do change their menu every once in a while).  

My go to appetizer is always the zucchini chips - fresh, light, not over fried or dripping in grease, perfect crispness and a great aioli sauce to accompany them.  My second favourite is the polenta fries (not great when they're cold, so eat while they're still warm!).  My husband loves their spicy tacos and though I hate spicy food, I did try a bit and they were good.

I will always highly recommend their short rib main - the beef is so tender that you don't need a knife.  This meat will melt in your mouth and you end up needing to pull pieces away with just your fork.  It's the most tender meat dish I've ever had; also came with root vegetables, mashed potatoes and gravy - perfect accompaniments (one friend substituted the mash with fries at a different dinner and it was nice, too).  To avoid myself from having it a third time in a row, my friend ordered it (gave me a small piece to share) and this time, I had the spaghettoni with seafood.  The pesto was great and it was nice and light.  Small scallops, but good size shrimps and definitely a good serving size.  

For dessert, I recommended the carrot cake to my friend and she loved it (I had some, too) and I ordered the phyllo-wrapped cheesecake with blueberry compote (to die for).  Both the carrot cake and cheesecake were incredibly moist, fresh, sweet but not too sweet and a good serving size.  I have a sweet tooth and though I love sweets, I hate when it's overdone and they do sweets here perfectly.

Though we had finished our desserts and had just been chatting for a while, Katie attentively refilled our waters and coffee without asking and her great service made the experience that much better.

In the past, some of the other dishes I've had were the pizza (flat crust - nice and light), steak and frites (nice and traditional), salmon (also nice and light) and their burger (juicy, fresh and filling).  

We're coming here again...and again...and again..."}
{"text":"Went there for Easter brunch this weekend and the restaurant had really nice ambiance.  PB&J french toast was delicious although I wish it came with sides. Other dishes such beef brisket and salmon toast looked really good as well.

Good value if you are going for brunch as there are $5 mimosas on Sundays."}
{"text":"I went for lunch. They had the summer menu and I ordered the gazpacho and the burger. The gazpacho was a cold soup based on strawberry a little bit spicy. A new flavor for me. I still have mixed feelings with that. The burger was really good. It's a nice place with very good service. I like it."}
{"text":"Was there for brunch with friends - I never complain about restaurants and have a high tolerance for most things but have to say the service was horrible and food was disappointing.  I ordered avocado toast which itself was ok but portions were small, and salad looked and tasted like it came from a mediocre buffet.  Waiter was inattentive and rude.  I was really looking forward to trying this place out, but unfortunately would not recommend."}
{"text":"I like it here, it's really similar to Oliver and Bonacini Café and Grill. The service was fantastic and really friendly. The vibe is relaxed, and feels more like a café.  We ordered from the brunch menu today and everyone enjoyed their meals. I had the beet salad with ricotta. It was so good, like eating desert for lunch. The beets were nice and sweet with herbs and mint and the rich, creamy ricotta had a lovely citrus flavour to it. Toasted walnuts added just the right crunch and texture. Although it looked small on the plate at first, it was very filling. Overall, great service, good food, will come back again."}
{"text":"It's a nice quite atmosphere. The food is good and reasonably priced with good service. There could be some improvements made to the quality & quantity of food. 
I will come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food and decent prices given location at the Saks. Been there twice already!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant but....

the food is not good. Ordered the turkey meatball dish and the avocado toast. Turkey meatballs were soggy and swimming in an extremely salty broth along with some soaked green leaves and some couscous. Almost flavourless except for the burning level of salt in the broth.

Avocado toast was nothing special. Was quite bland.

Would have rated it lower but it really is a beautiful space. Shame that their food is so poorly done. Might give it another shot for a business lunch in the future."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday brunch and the space, decor and service makeup for what the food lacks. I got the PB&J French Toast - it has ice cream which made the toast soggy and the peanut butter was very overpowering in taste. I had higher expectations given its an O&B restaurant but will probably return to check out the dinner menu as I loved the space and decor. 

Their Bellini's are great and $5 you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Located inside the Saks 5th Ave store within Sherway Gardens mall, Beaumont Kitchen is Oliver and Bonacini's newest restaurant serving up modern fare in a casual-chic environment. 

We stopped here after a long day of shopping (oh, the horror!), and it's safe to say that this place has become our favourite eatery in Sherway and one that we'll revisit. 

The decor is modern but on the casual side (the servers wear jeans, and no one batted an eye at me coming in my lululemons), with dark wood decor and lots of booth/banquet seating. 

The dinner menu has a range of shareable appetizers, salads, pizzas and mains. We had the Zucchini sticks (alright), Spiced Beets salad (must-have! Like beets pickled in spiced cider on a bed of ricotta and walnuts), Cauliflower pizza (thin  crust, cauliflower, fiore di latte and oregano was surprisingly flavourful), Pickerel (cooked perfectly, with a delicious apricot carrot puree), and flank steak (decent but I've had better). We didn't have time for dessert but they are known for their phyllo pastry wrapped light cheesecake. 

Prices were reasonable for the quality (almost all mains in the $20 - 30 range), and the fact that it's located in Saks (quite possibly the cheapest thing in the store!). Service was professional and courteous, and dinner came out promptly. 

If you're already at Sherway, eat here, no question. If you're not already at Sherway, eat here and check out the mall as a side trip!"}
{"text":"The decor and restaurant is designed very well. It's a spacious restaurant and would be ideal for a large crowd. As much as I wanted to love this restaurant I just couldn't. My experience wasn't awful but it wasn't at par with some other restaurants in the area I have visited. The service was slow and some items on the menu weren't available. I ordered the chilaquiles, and I asked for my egg to be scrambled instead of fried...when I received my dish I noticed my eggs were on the side and were r, which wasn't what I had expected. One of my friends didn't even receive the right order."}
{"text":"Great addition to the west end of Toronto. We went here on Saturday night and it got quite busy so we were thankful we made reservations and came early. 

The restaurant is located on the main floor of Sherway Gardens inside of Saks. The service is top notch and the restaurant is beautiful. 

Everyone who works there was extremely professional and welcoming. At our table, we had the potato and bacon soup, crab cake, calamari tacos, flat iron steak, and halibut (daily special). The eclectic menu has sharing plates, appetizers, salads and entrees. I felt that most of the dishes had healthy components such as the use of complex carbs like quinoa and beans. 

To illustrate how service-oriented the staff here is, I will talk about how they handled a potentially negative experience. Everything we order was delicious, well presented, hot, etc. With the exception of the halibut I ordered. It came out on a bed of beans and sea asparagus and puréed sea asparagus sauce. I took a bite of the fish and it was perfectly cooked. I placed a forkful of beans, sea asparagus and sauce to my mouth and tasted salt - a lot of it. I tried to eat more but it was so salty that I was not enjoying it. I told our server and she asked if I wanted them to make it again. I thought about it and said no because I was so hungry and just wanted to eat. Despite my best efforts, I couldn't continue eating it. I asked the server for something else and she was happy to replace my entree. I ended up having the seafood linguine and was very happy with this choice. It was delicious. To top off how well they handled this situation, there were several staff members, I'm assuming management who came by to apologize and also to thank me for the feedback. 

I thought this experience shows how outstanding their service is. Their food is excellent too!  Try it out if you're in the area. Bonus: you can stroll around the mall after your meal and check out the new Sherway Gardens."}
{"text":"Great food and good prices. 
Not high end but that's OK. Great deal on Wednesdays for half-priced bottle of wines!  Will go back often"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for brunch last Sunday with a group of friends and had an amazing time. I ordered the beef brisket and it was super tender and moist...everything I hoped it would be and then some! My wife ordered the eggs benny with salmon and it was good...but the home fries were great! We also got a Margherita Pizza and I know what you're thinking...sounds pretty basic...well you're wrong! The kitchen somehow made something simple as the pizza taste above average. The atmosphere is great. The staff is pleasant. The overall experience is well worth the price. Highly recommend! Next time you're at Sherway Gardens, take a break from shopping and do yourself a favour and eat here!"}
{"text":"Service was slow but the waiter was pleasant and I believe was doing his best. Food is below cafeteria grade.  Coffee cold, and the tuna tartare should have been returned but it took almost 1 hour to get an appetizer size spread on the plate to look like a full portion with some awful dressing on top. Really disappointed. 

Try to get a chef not a cook to run this place. Also needs management. Nice location, but Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Really nice place - although first impression of the restaurant is that the picture on the website makes Beaumont look much bigger, and \"grander\" than it really is. 

I didn't enter the restaurant from outside, but rather, walking through Saks. It is located right by the shoe section, and is really easily missed. But once you're in, the restaurant has a jivey, happening vibe!

The food was really, really yummy! Shout outs go to the Cod cake (it's only one piece) and Black Bean Dip. My husband really liked the Porchetta pizza, but I didn't like it. Not the taste, but the way the pizza is made which is really thin, thin (like eating a really thin dry pita). My husband really liked it so I guess it's really all about personal taste on this one.

I had the pickerel which is SOOOO YUMMY! So many flavor profiles and really tender fish. I HIGHLY recommend this. A lot of people around the table had the brisket, and while good, was nothing outstanding. My husband had the burger and he said the best part of it was the fries so...

And please. Do yourself and everyone at the table by ordering dessert. Specifically, the cheese cake that's wrapped in phylo (sp - too lazy to check spelling!!) pastry which tastes like warm, sweet custard AND the blueberry toast for two. When the waiter brought it out, it looks mammoth but rest assured it will be gone in seconds. This is also a popular brunch item and I can see why.

All in all, this was a great experience and I am very satisfied I tried a Saks restaurant (operated by O&B). Service was excellent. Food was very good. And of course the ambiance was great! I can only imagine a full day of shopping at Saks, this would be the perfect place to rest and unwind. 

Give it a try! You won't be disappointed.

FYI: Bathrooms are unisex, which apparently are all the rage. Doors are unmarked so you think you're entering into some random room, but any door that is not marked \"employee\" are the bathrooms (individual rooms)."}
{"text":"For a O&B restaurant, had high hopes for this restaurant. Now although the ambience and seating are well thought out (cushion seats, very picturesque), the food is sub-par. We came during summerlicious the first time and the menu was very limited. They do not offer regular menu items during summerlicious, so choices were very narrow.

The fried calamari tacos were our favourite. The sea scallops were also good but they overdid it with the cheese on the risotto the scallops came with. The cheese was really overpowering, that you couldn't even appreciate the scallops. Their mushroom soup also had a layer of oil on top (see picture for visual). The pudding chomeur was our least favourite dish- so disappointing considering this was our supposed dessert. We hardly touched it. 

If you're looking to come for breakfast, it's much better than their lunch or dinner. The Salmon Benedict and avocado scotch egg was really good."}
{"text":"went on a Sunday with a few co workers for lunch and didn't expect much. Went in with an open mind that it is a restaurant inside saks. A few smiles from staff but not much else to add to that. They were friendly but that was about it. Maybe more enthusiastic about the food or have some lunch specials, etc. Just your typical have you been to Beaumont kitchen before. 

Few of us ordered the braised beef brisket (choice of soup, Yukon gold fries or green salad)

Wasn't the best I've ever had and you gotta eat here! type feeling so I give it an honest 3. It's a nice atmosphere and it was quiet for a Sunday. I think I'd rather go to faema for a slice of  but that's just me. Maybe I'll go back again but it won't be at the top of my list."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant.  Just loved the ambiance.  My friend took me to Beaumont Kitchen for a late birthday dinner.  My friend ordered the fish and chips which was a huge portion for lunch.  The fries and fish were very fresh and perfectly seasoned.  I ordered the root vegetable salad with grilled shrimp which was absolutely delicious and healthy. We also ordered the lentil soup which was very light and refreshing. For appetizers we ordered the calamari tacos and warm spinach dip and they were both very good 10 out of 10.
Would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for now. 

I've been coming here since opening week and this place has it's ups and downs. My first time here (3 days after opening) was fabulous, everything was on point. Based on that experience I booked my birthday dinner here for a Saturday night and it was the complete opposite. Service was frantic and confused (they even had the bartender taking orders) and the food was poor. My medium rare streak came to me extremely blue. Additionally, somebody in my party notified them ahead of time it was my birthday and the restaurant even asked how to spell my name. On the night of, the hostess wished me a happy birthday but that was the extent of it. I saw other tables around me getting celebration desserts with candles and the works but I disappointedly received nothing. 

After that experience I took a break from this restaurant. I ended up back here again because it's one of the nicer restaurants in the neighbourhood and it's convenient if you're already in the mall. Over time it's improved a lot. The menu is has improved (they got rid of their turkey-meatball-sitting-in-salty water dish) and the service is a bit smoother now. It's not the same restaurant I experienced during opening week but hopefully it'll get back up there with time."}
{"text":"Expensive Meh!

I have given this place two tries.  The food has been undercooked, salty, small and expensive.  Its a pretty place but they need vast improvements in quality.  The drink of the day is worth having so maybe a drinks place and skip the food."}
{"text":"One of Mississauga's fancier places....its interior makes you feel like you are in a nice place in downtown Toronto, with lounge style seating available as well as tables.
I've eaten brunch, lunch and dinner here and while all three were good, dinner is definitely the nicest meal. I have yet to eat a bad meal at Beaumont Kitchen. The service can be spotty once in a while but mostly, it has been very good. I hosted my birthday dinner there for 30 friends and they were extremely accommodating in providing a pre-fixe menu that specified Halal options for my friends. Their manager and chef were very helpful in communicating all the different menus available and the staff made sure that the appetizers and drinks were kept topped up. It was a stress free party made possible by Beaumont Kitchen :)"}
{"text":"I had dinner yesterday, we had an amazing pizza with whole wheat crust smoked pork and pineapple, it was sooo good, also the cheesecake was really good... I hope to go soon again the brunch menu looks great.. The restaurant is modern and beautiful. :)"}
{"text":"Great daily drink deals and friendly service. Beautiful lunch menu and fantastic food. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff! Came here for winterlicious for dinner. Now I can't wait to come back. My friend didn't like her dessert, they took it and brought her something different. Great service!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here last night for my friends' birthday and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was a Tuesday evening so it wasn't busy at the restaurant.

The atmosphere was really nice, clean and modern decor throughout the place.  Very friendly staff service right from when you walk in to when you leave.  The service was a little slow at the beginning, but I wouldn't hold that against them as they were on point with checking our tables and filling our waters consistently.  Whenever we asked or needed something it was at our tables right away.

Now the important part of the review...the food!! Everything I had/tasted from my friends was amazing with great taste and cook.  Nothing was overly or under cooked, just great tasting food.  Perfect portioning size so we cleaned our plates feeling completely satisfied and full (at least I was).  The menu isn't extensive, which is probably why they serve out such good items as the menu is not overwhelming with a bunch of things.  I had the glazed short ribs with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables...amazingly tender fall apart short ribs!  My app was the zucchini chips with aioli, loved it!  My friends had me taste their dishes as well, the dinner special, prawn pasta in a creamy sauce and browned scallops with risotto....just delicious!  Scallops were huge and perfectly cooked, the pasta in the dinner special was delightful.  

All in all, I would definitely go here again.  With the great food and friendly service...how could I not?  Thanks for a great evening Beaumont Kitchen!"}
{"text":"We went for Brunch yesterday, the food and service was outstanding. The PB & J stuffed french toast was creative and absolutely delicious! The chilaquiles were also awesome! The staff is very friendly and the cocktails were all exceptionally made. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant. If you enjoy brunch in Montreal, then you know what this place is like! It's great. Such a great vibe, great staff, good food and lots of delicious options. Highly recommend it!

It is inside the mall, which for me means I associated it with food court type fare -- how wrong I was! Really nice restaurant and great food!"}
{"text":"We, a party of three, booked for lunch to enjoy the winterlicious promotion. A very reasonably priced prixe fixee three course menu offered a lot. Salmon with beets and gnocchi were two delightful starters. The main course choices were varied, including pork, haddock, and a delightful pasta dish.
For desert we all chose the Brie with a very acceptable damson compote and sweet crackers.
We were sat promptly, even though we arrived unfashionably early and our waiter was attentive and pleasant. 
We felt welcomed and appreciated rather than tolerated as has been the case in some establishments when dining on the winterlicious menu.
There was no attempt at up selling. We enjoyed a Beaumont Bellini as an aperitif and I really enjoyed a nice glass of the Argentine Malbec.
In short this is a great upscale bistro style restaurant, providing good quality and generous portions in a friendly, modern ambiance.
I recommend this restaurant without hesitation."}
{"text":"This restaurant is attached to Saks at Sherway Gardens so maybe not the greatest placement of designer shoes after mimosas...or brilliant -- fine line. :) 

My sister and I decided to do a spontaneous brunch here without reservations. Although I'd recommend resos, they were also nice enough to offer us a spot in the lounge area to eat. 

The menu is on the smaller side and due to my intense craving for bacon this morning I went for the eggs Straight Up however, I'm interested in trying to avocado toast next time. The food was decent. I think we may have just ordered the most basic thing on the menu but the $5 mimosa special -- now THAT deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Came with a group of friends for Sunday brunch to this restaurant, located inside of Sherway Gardens.

My veggie omelette was really tasty and potatoes were decent. Note that while the serving was filling it wasn't as large as brunch dishes usually are, and no bread was included. My friends got scrambled eggs as a side and it was very runny, so would stay away from ordering that.

We enjoyed the food for the most part, but the wait between requests was long, the server admitted they were understaffed that day. E.g. I asked for ketchup for my potatoes - it was brought to the table while I was taking my late bite."}
{"text":"Went in for brunch on Saturday around 11am. The restaurant is spacious with beautiful upscale decor. We got the avocado scotch egg and roasted beets salad and they were both delicious! What I liked the most about this location was that it was quiet which made it more enjoyable unlike other brunch places in the city. I didn't have any high hopes or expectations going in today but I'd definitely be returning for brunch again. Maybe I'll try their regular menu next time."}
{"text":"This is the second time I'm here. Food and service have improved dramatically. 

Brunch: I had smoked Salmon on croissant - they don't usually offer it on croissant but hey we're happy to oblige. So good."}
{"text":"Went here when they first opened, my friend and I asked which of the salads could be made vegan and it seems they aren't too familiar with their menu just yet. Turns out there was literally only one option! 

With so many health and dietary needs of customers today, you'd think that there would be more options or even adjustments that could be made. 

None the less we were told them next time to call ahead and they could have something prepared for us. Which I must say was a nice gesture but often times I don't plan exactly where I'm going to eat while in the mall. It would be nice if I didn't need to make a special call and there were just more options available. 

None the less, the restaurant is beautiful inside and a nice atmosphere. 

We enjoyed their drinks they were delicious!  

I will likely give them another try, the staff really did feel sorry and expressed it. 

Good service, nice atmosphere and other than the lack of options for those with dietary needs or concerns, nice place :)"}
{"text":"It was a nice and relaxing atmosphere. It would be nice to have some wine and a cheese plate but this time I had brunch. I had eggs benny with maple ham.  I was worried about the ham because I thought it would be too sweet but it was perfect.  My wife enjoyed hers with avocado. The base was a biscuit instead of an English muffin. The biscuit was a nice surprise, it absorbed the perfect amount if butter that matched well with eggs, ham and hollandaise sauce."}
{"text":"Honestly, I didn't think I would like it. I though it'd be a pretentious place since it's at Saks but in honesty the wait staff was very friendly and welcoming. They always asked if anything was needed and had a warm smile on their faces.

My wife order the burger as did I while my mother-in-law ordered the roasted beet appetizer and baby spinach salad. Everything was delicious and we were all pleased with our orders.

The burger that I order was small compared to some other places but it was thick and very juicy. Yes, it can be considered \"pricey\" but considering where you are it's not too bad. The burger was simple but tasty and perhaps one of the top ones I've ever had. It was moist and flavourful with a little pink in the middle... give it a try, you won't regret it.

Our waitress, Madison, was extremely nice and we never felt rushed to leave even though our meal was over and our billed paid. She even gave my mother-in-law a free dessert for her birthday even though she didn't want to order one because she was stuff. It even had Happy Birthday written in chocolate. Seriously, Madison was awesome. Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"Such a great place a girl brunch. Interior design and decor it warm, high ceiling and spacious, and seats are comfortable to sit and chat for hours on end. Location is really easy to get to as it's just off the QEW with ample free parking around the mall where the restaurant is located. Food is plated nicely and in terms of taste is probably a 3.5 star as the eggs benedict was not runny enough and the salmon was overly salty, but still descent food. Worth it considering it's such a nice place to catch up over brunch and the service was attentive and detailed. Never had to ask for my water to be refilled and they stopped by to check in on us without letting us feel intruded in our conversations and extremely polite staff that wait on you. 

The price is on the mid/high end with one main course ranging around the $20 mark per plate. Add a latte or coffee plus tax and tip, and you're looking at a $30 bill. Overall would still highly recommend considering it's close enough for those on the border of Mississauga and Toronto, and really nice location to get away without having to travel all the way downtown. Definitely having a girls brunch or meal with my date there again!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my best friend. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is chic. Located next to Sak's Fifth Ave.  Ladies are drinking juice out of champagne flutes. The brunch is excellent. Eggs Benny one of the best I've ever had. Eggs were perfectly poached. The potatoes were too salty, hence the four stars but I would definitely come back for dinner."}
{"text":"I went to Beaumont kitchen for Winterlicious 2018 with my family. Since we had a reservation, we were seated quickly and introduced to our waiter. We were given menus with both the winterlicious menu and brunch menu. For starters, we ordered 2 gnocchi Frittis and 2 beet-cured salmons. Both were delicious and a decent portion. The entrees we ordered were 2 ragus, 1 risotto and 1 crispy haddock. For dessert we ordered 2 chocolate peanut butter puddings, 1 warm Brie and 1 date cake. After ordering, the dishes took a bit long to arrive. The appetizers were all very good, the beet-cured salmon was beautifully prepared. The entrees all had good portions, the risotto was very generous with mushrooms, the Ragu was delicious but the haddock was slightly bland and was nothing special. For dessert the chocolate peanut butter pudding turns out to just be some thick chocolate pudding with some roasted peanuts on top. The warm Brie was a couple pieces of bread to dip into the cheese and was okay and the date cake was small but pretty delicious (it reminded me of a sticky toffee pudding). The restaurant was lively and beautifully decorated but the food was good but probably not worth the $28 value."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went on a Friday night for summerlicious. The staff were friendly and the decor was open and modern. Several tables and chairs for dining and several coffee tables and sofas too. May be fun to lounge in there while shopping to grab a quick drink and food. It was pretty full but noise level was pretty good.
The food was all tasty but portion sizes were inconsistent. My husband had the tuna tartare (tiny portion but fine for starter) and striploin meal which was adequate for him. I had the beet salad which tasted good and was a decent portion. I ordered the lemon pasta (they made mine gluten free as requested) with peas/beans, which was delicious but wasn't nearly enough to satisfy my hunger. I actually had to order polenta fries off the regular menu to feel satisfied but I would have rather had a bit more pasta.
I requested they not bring our dessert until we finished the polenta fries but they brought it immediately after our polenta fries arrived (with ice cream melted). We had to request cutlery for the polenta and dessert instead of anyone being observant enough to realize we needed it (same with having water glass refilled). I had the s'mores brownie and hubby had the bread pudding. Both were okay....nothing amazing."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about Beaumont Kitchen, so it really was just a matter of time before I wound up there.

We arrived around 3:00 on a weekday and the place was pretty much deserted. We had our pick of tables and were quickly approached by our very helpful server. I opted to start with the soup of the day, which was some kind of roasted red pepper concoction. It was actually really, really tasty. The soup was thick, hearty, and rich, and it came topped with a few breadcrumbs and, in a stroke of genius, a thick piece of toasted parmesan. I'd never had cheese done this way before on a soup, so it really was something of a revelation.

For my main I went with the linguine (prawns, bay scallops, white wine, basil pesto). Again, this was a very well put-together dish that was filling and delicious. The pasta was a little overcooked, admittedly, and the whole thing was probably a little too greasy, but the pesto was spot on and I was impressed with the sheer amount of scallops and prawns in it.

It wasn't a cheap meal, to be sure, but it was definitely a rock-solid one."}
{"text":"Had their eggs benny with spinach and salmon. Option to pick potatoes or salad. The ambience is great and even on long weekend it was pretty quite. They don't have a ton of variety for brunch but still worth it. A bit pricey so save it for something special!"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Decor: The decor in the restaurant is really nice! Very modern and picture worthy.  
- Spacious: The seating is very generous and you don't feel crammed in a space. 
- Service: Our server was so nice and explained all my options for substituting sides and what is popular which really helped with my decision on what to order. 


Cons:
- Food: The food was not bad, but it also wasn't great. I got the Steak Frites with Caesar salad instead of fries. Unfortunately"}
{"text":"We had been here once before a while back and it was pretty decent. 

Last week we were here shopping and needed to get some dinner in before we went home. And a neighbour suggested that Beaumont was really good and baby friendly. 

As you can see from the picture, the place was quite empty. So we got a bench seat at the end where we could pit the stroller. 

Service was good but perhaps a little slower than usual especially for a restaurant with four tables occupied. But we were in a hurry, as most infant toting couples are, so anything would have been slow to us. 

They were good with my allergies. Made sure to check and tell me what had dairy. 

We had a soup, and two pastas. All were delicious and the fresh bread, which took a bit since it was baking when we came in, apparently was great (it has dairy so I did not try). 

Would I go back.  Sure. Am I crazy about it. Nah. It is nice. It is not the cheapest but you do get quality ingredients and well prepared meals in a very pleasant space. So if that is your cup of tea, then. Y all means."}
{"text":"My barley risotto was so overpowered with onions that it's all I could taste. They should have called it an onion risotto. I don't even remember the menu item stating that it had onions or shallots. It would have been good otherwise.
The roasted chicken was dry and very unflavorful. Overall, the atmosphere is nice, but the workers seem very pretentious. The whole time in there I felt like I wasn't comfortable...like I wasn't classy or rich enough. I even saw them gossiping about customers on the side. 
The prices are WAY too high for the food you get....that's the low-down of it."}
{"text":"Time: Saturday night
Ambiance: Poor 
Food: Good quality and portion size
Service: very good, server was really attentive, did not have good food knowledge though. 

The restaurant was very bright, could have dimmed the lights a tad bit. 

It was not very busy with only four tables booked. 

The food was delicious. We had the mushroom pizza, it was a big hit. I had the cod, little over seasoned with salt but cod was perfectly cooked. Drinks were ok, not amazing. Hubby had the chicken supreme. It was cooked nicely. We also had the green mac and cheese for my daughter. It only had one piece of broccoli. That dish was overpriced for what it is. 
We had the molten chocolate cake for desert. Small and decadent. A little too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for brunch on a Saturday (have had dinner here as well, see my seperate review).  Nice upscale crowd, from a dress perspective, did not feel snooty by any means as there were families, couples, friends and large groups present.  Ambiance is very modern and one can see a lot of work has gone into the design with a bar, lounge and a seperate seating area.  We ordered the smoked salmon toast and the beef brisket hash.  Smoked salmon came with a choice of a side and I chose the mixed greens.  Both dishes were done really well, and were very filling (despite the mixed greens side ordered with the salmon as I could have had fries or mashed potatoes I think).  The reason I have docked a star here is because of the value, for a breakfast / brunch on a Saturday, it was very pricey, $50+ tax/tip for mains and coffee.  Also, coffee was very average, I would try an espresso based beverage next time.  Overall, would recommend the brunch if you need to impress someone, but would skip if on a budget with a family."}
{"text":"Yum! I really enjoyed this place! I was expecting it to be a lot more expensive than it was considering it's located in Saks, but I found the prices to be pretty reasonable! (I did see that brunch was pretty pricey though).

My friend and I weren't overly hungry so we got the parmesan zucchini sticks, thai root vegetable salad and cauliflower pizza to share. All were very delicious, although very small portion of zucchini sticks! 

I also loved the atmosphere here! Very trendy, but not over the top! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Dined at this restaurant last night, as it was the only place at Sherway that had a table available (Friday night) and now we know why. The service was ok. We had a new waiter and she did well. 
The food on the other hand was terrible. We had the wild mushroom pizza and calamari tacos. What was suspicious off the bat was how quickly the food came. Literally took 5 minutes. Secondly, the pizza looked dry and so it was. We are pretty sure the pizza was premade and reheated. Mushrooms were al dente and tasteless. As for tacos the only positive were the fresh corn tortillas. Overall very disappointed and while their menu looks decent, we would not dine there again. Nice bar area though so a good drink / coffee spot."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE their phyllo cheesecake - one of the best dessert I have had so far! They have exceptional service. Only downfall is they do close pretty early."}
{"text":"Went here for summerlicious dinner tonight as a special treat for my wife. I was extremely disappointed. We ordered the beet salad , the glazed salmon and the lemon  posset. The beet salad was okay and the toasted sunflower seeds was the best thing on the plate. The lemon posset was really disappointing being just sweet without any distinct lemon flavour, it was just a poor yogurt with two measly blackberries. The worst was my wife's salmon which was so gritty she felt like she was eating a beach there was so much sand in it. The bok.choy was tough and full of grit from not being cleaned properly. We complained and they did  compensate us and were apologetic but it kind of spoiled the evening. I know it was summerlicious but for $38 dollars a person I think they should not let there standards drop so much."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this restaurant more than I did. We went for summerlicious so sometimes you have to lower your expectations. The restaurant ambiance was nice and clean. The service was great as well. The food was where this experience fell short.

We shared the calamari tacos to start (not a summerlicious menu item). They were a little too crispy for my liking but it was because they were breaded with cornmeal. The sauces were tasty and the overall taco was good. The tuna tataki was lacking in some seasoning but tasted fresh. The striploins at our table were all overcooked except one (requested medium rare, came medium to medium-well). The chicken piccata was flavourful and juicy however the broccolini was too salty for me. The potatoes were only average. Desserts were the last opportunity to impress me and they didn't! The lemon posset was light and delicious but the presentation was poor. The s'mores brownie was disappointing as the brownie tasted mediocre at best and the whole dessert just seemed like something I could've made myself at home with some graham crackers and marshmallows thrown on a plate with some brownie chunks. Two-bite brownies would've been better. 

Considering the fairly good reviews by other yelpers, and the O&B name, I really thought this place would be better. I would be willing to come again though to try out their brunch for a fair review."}
