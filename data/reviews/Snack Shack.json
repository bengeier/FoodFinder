{"text":"Been here a couple of times the jerk pork is legit and has ahold amount of heat. The burgers are phenomenal. This will be my new go to for burgers In the west"}
{"text":"Well this place seems to impress me every time I go in.  I've had the Bahn Mi and Fish Tacos here in the past and they were both fantastic. But I wanted to try at least a third item before I posted my review.  I had a craving for jerk and went to a nearby \"Caribbean\" hole. After two terrible bites, I had to throw it away. It was that bad. So I walked over to Snack Shack and low and behold, jerk pork was the special of the day ($6.50 for a small, $10.00 for a large). Strange prices since the jerk chicken is only $5.00 for a small and $6.50 for a large and it wasn't the day's special. Oh well, I wanted pork, and I'm so glad I ordered it! After explaining my bad experience at the nearby \"Caribbean\" shop, the man at the cash explained that the chef was Jamaican and assured me that it would be more authentic.  It sure was! Carefully prepared over piping hot rice n' peas, this was the most moist and tender jerk pork I have ever had. It wasn't chewy nor fatty whatsoever. It exploded with bright flavours of scallion and allspice. Accompanied by a fresh, crunchy purple slaw, it was perfection.  I thanked both men and promised I'd be back soon. Which I will!  *Update 01/19/2018: Well I made it back for more of this wonderful jerk pork to find out they were out. I \"settled\" for the jerk chicken. It was just as good, if not better, than the pork! I left my kudos with the chef after we discussed his methods a bit, (I cook my own jerk at home and I'm a sponge for any new tricks). This guy knows his flavours. Wow. I hope the owner of Snack Shack appreciates his staff as much as I now do.  I hope the writer of the only non-5-star review here will come back for another try."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like a poor student all over again - and trust me, there is nothing wrong with being a poor student, those were some of the happiest years of my young adult life!  I digress... why does it bring back fond memories of the student life? It's because the Snack Shack reminds me of those cheap and delicious spots we could go to for awesome eats at all hours (somehow they're always right next to a 7-11).  It's a simple, 4-6 seat, mostly take-away joint, with an assortment of simple easy to carry menu options. I was intrigued by the tacos and burritos, and chicken fingers, but it was the Bahn Mi sandwich option that caught me off guard and reeled me in.  Between the Chicken and the Beef option I went with the Chicken Bahn Mi. It was fantastic! A full sized crusty bun filled with deliciously seasoned and cooked chicken and topped with sauce, and a ton of quintessential FRESH bahn mi veggies (carrots, cucumbers, cilantro).  The sandwich was a perfect lunch size, a great taste AND most importantly - only cost me $4.50!! What?!?!?! Great taste, AND great value for money? It sure feels like I can live the student life again anytime I want - just a short walk away!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"I love eating there!!! It's cheap and good BUT it closes so early. I wish it stayed open until later because I've felt like having dinner there a lot with my friends but it always closes at 7. For a dinner place I guess staying open until maybe 9 would be better"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick meal. We got the banh mi, fish tacos, and ended with the churros... All delicious! Parking is available right in front. Space inside is small but there are a few seats if you would like to stay and eat. Very cool vibe!"}
{"text":"Banh is OK, obviously authentic is better.  Chicken tenders are a small serving but decent (heavily breaded, not for the healthy eaters). This place makes sense with Humber college so close. Be nice to see more options in the boring neighbourhood.  Overall average at best."}
