{"text":"There is nothing gourmet about these burgers. This place sucks for so many reasons. No temp,you can not even compare this place to a gourmet burger resturaunt such as the The flip side, The Rail, Bspot, I would compare Inferno to a Wendys,Burger king, Mcdonalds. The Resturant was empty on a Friday evening and it took 20 min before we got any service. This place will be out of business soon. The menu is written very well but the food is not executed as described and that bugs me also.  The bathrooms were filthy.  Sean should pay more attention to this place.  Romeos is great--this place needs help."}
{"text":"The wait staff is very friendly and hard working. Food is good provided you are not in any hurry to eat.  Whoever is managing this place needs to take some courses on scheduling.  The 2 times we have been here, the wait for the food is too long.  Part of the problem (I think) is, one kitchen for two restaurants and the pizza part of the business must take precedence.  The other issue is you have one waitress and one greeter trying to service the entire dinning room.  Probably will not be back until they hire more staff."}
{"text":"Service was good and a good variety of gourmet burgers. There is a toppings bar consisting of the basics to complement your burger. Happy hour lasts until 6PM with $2 drafts, $1 fries. Noise level is a tad above average but tolerable to hold a conversation without having to shout. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I went there to try to see how their burgers were. I was very happy with the service that I got, the waitress was very helpful,friendly & courteous. I ordered the Angus burger which I could order any kind of toppings or go to the area & put my own topping on the burger. I also got their fries, they were crispy, hot & very tasty. I also ordered a diet soda & I was really surprised to see how cheap my bill was. With everything that I ordered my bill was only $10.63 not including the tip. I will go back there in a heartbeat. The music videos were absolutely awesome. I like to listen to the music while I was eating. I know I will have to try one of their other burgers the next time that my husband & I decide to go out to eat."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed when I look at Inferno's reviews, the vast majority are negative, but somehow they have been filtered.  Only positive to moderately positive reviews show.  I feel that this gives an unfair picture of the inconsistent quality of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and a very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Brought my friend N for a quick work lunch.  She's from the area but had never tried Inferno.  I only knew about it through yelp.  Inferno is located on the road where most restaurants and fast food chains also compete for your business, but it's worth a look.    When we arrived, just after noon on a weekday, the parking lot was eerily empty.  Once inside, the place is large and clean, with 80s videos on the many TVs and framed records on the walls.  The waitresses are dressed in black tank tops and cut off jean (short) shorts - N thought they were trying to channel Hooters.  We each ordered a shake - Egg Nog (limited time only) for me and Chocolate for her.  $4 each.  Decent size, with tons of flavor and whipped cream on top.  I chose the New Orleans burger, medium, which comes with a Cajun rub, grilled shrimp, pepper jack cheese and chipotle ranch, on a pretzel roll.  My burger ended up being cooked through, but it was still juicy enough.  Amazing toppings - I ate it as-is, without adding a thing from the free toppings bar!  Soft roll doesn't overwhelm the other flavors.  I would definitely get this burger again!  N went with the Wisconsin burger, which came topped with Tillamook Cheddar, mozzarella and provolone cheese plus chopped applewood bacon.  She added mayo from the toppings bar (Note:  most of the good toppings, like a fried egg or bacon or sauteed onions, cost $1 each... so the build your own burger can get pricey).  We both thought this place easily rated a 4.  She's already thinking about going back with her family.  I'm 200 miles away, so all I have (for now) is my memories."}
{"text":"We tried this new burger bar in Medina with my son, my brother-in-law, and his son. We ordered three Inferno Burgers and one Seattle burger - all with the pretzel buns. Overall, I think everyone enjoyed their burgers, but no one went crazy over them. I thought my burger had a bit of a \"gamey\" flavor to it (for lack of a better description), but the toppings and pretzel bun were very good. I was the only one to try the Inferno fries, and I thought those were great. I also had a vanilla milkshake and - despite not being a malt - it was very good (for the life of me, I can't understand why some places don't offer malted shakes too ... just need the powder). Although the place seemed to be going for more of a contemporary atmosphere (e.g., B-Spot), it still felt a bit like a local tavern."}
{"text":"I love the burgers...they are the best in town.  The Wisconsin burger on pretzel bun is excellent and add some fries or onion rings and you are all set.  The topping bar is great and you have to get the chipolte sauce for the fries or onion rings."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this one, but we just couldn't rate it any higher.  First off, the decor:  the interior has some walls that are painted in a red/orange gradient, which looks cool.  But the other walls are painted flat black, which, granted, might look okay at night, but we were there in the afternoon on a sunny day.  Therefore, my eyes couldn't adjust because I was seated facing a window, so they would have to go from bright sun to jet black paint, and so I spent most of the visit just looking down.  Signed guitars from various rock legends are hanging on the wall - so why were we listening to soft pop?  By the time we left, Adele's \"Someone Like You\" was on and we just wanted to cry into our drinks.  They are categorized as a sports bar - play some AC/DC for pity's sake. Which leads to the next part - a half dozen flat screen televisions, and they were all playing the exact same game.  On to the food.  First, I eat mostly vegetarian, while my husband is definitely a carnivore.  So I was thrilled to see that they have a veggie burger as part of their burger bar.  I had a veggie burger on a pretzel bun, with pepper jack cheese, a cajun rub, and the chipotle ranch.  It wasn't bad, and it was a real veggie burger, not a defrosted Boca burger.  Kudos for that.  My husband, however, ordered a burger, and after that, we realized that the waitress never asked him how he wanted it cooked.  We waited just out of sheer curiosity to see if she would come back once the kitchen asked, but that never happened.  They ended up going with well done, which he would not have chosen.  In addition, we ordered the sweet potato fries as an appetizer, and didn't receive them till we were halfway done with our burgers.  The waitress did apologize for that.  However, the service was ungodly slow for a restaurant in which we were one of three tables - the rest were empty.  Again - we really, really wanted to like it here, and I give them props for their veggie burger, but the experience itself was just not worth it.  Until things change, Inferno, we are going to look around for \"Someone Like You\" - just not you."}
{"text":"Went with the hubs for a date night. Six on a Friday night. We were the only people in the place and that should have told us to run while we could. Our waitress seemed put out that we were there and had to stop flirting with the pizza dudes in the adjoining Romeo's.   I ordered the New Orleans burger (shrimp on top) and hubby got the Philly cheesesteak burger. After 20 minutes and no offer of drink refills, the food arrived.   Yuck is all I can say. The meat tasted freezer burned and the bun on my husband's sandwich looked like it was stomped on before putting it together.  We asked for the manager and were told he was too busy to come talk to us. Nice. Can't wait for this stinker to close down."}
{"text":"Went here again to try to figure out exactly what the burger reminded me of. After examining every bite it brought back a taste that I remember from 20 years ago and that was one from the old tv dinners. These remind me exactly of the Salsbury steak tv dinners grandma used to serve. Now not that that is a bad taste but when I go to a burger bar I want a real beef burger grilled there on the spot not a warmed up premade meat patty! Yes the burger was gray and definitely processed, but I will give them two stars due to their awesome onion rings, nice servers and their great choice of 80's music videos."}
