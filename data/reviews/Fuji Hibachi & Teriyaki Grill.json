{"text":"I ordered the teriyaki chicken & steak, which was fairly good for fast food. Nothing too exciting about the food or interior. A little pricy for what you get - $12 for some chicken, steak & rice on a Styrofoam plate. I'll stick with Chipotle or Salsarita's going forward or spend more at a full restaurant if I'm in the mood for Japanese."}
{"text":"Awesome place for food. Good atmosphere. Low-key but nice decor for dining. Great location to get grub after drinking too!"}
{"text":"Fuji is a fast food Asian joint in the Epicentre. Pick your protein, chicken, shrimp, tofu and it comes with fried rice and sauteed/steamed vegetables. Choose between teriyaki style or hibachi style. Don't expect any authentic Japanese food here. It's more akin to Asian food you can find in the mall at the food court. Or even like a Chinese take out joint. The staff was friendly. Service was prompt. I got the seafood combo hibachi style. Hibachi style has a soy based sauce. The teriyaki sauce has a sweeter sauce. That's the main difference. All platters also come with carrots and \"shrimp\" sauce, which to me is really just some kind of seasoned mayonnaise sauce. The seafood combo had shrimp, scallops, and imitation crab meat. I asked to get extra vegetables instead of rice. They do give good sized portions. I was quite full after finishing my meal. And for what I knew it was, it tasted pretty good. We also had the fried wings, which came out pretty juicy, and the vegetable dumplings, which I would pass on if I came back."}
{"text":"Hibachi taste without the price. Chicken was dry but the shrimp aka Yum Yum sauce cancelled it out."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. Had the lunch special couldn't eat it. The chicken was rubber ,the sauce seemed to be too fishy. The vegetables were average"}
{"text":"Yay first reviewer! Today was their grand openening.....hence, the first review.  Went here today around lunch time and it was slammed! It is very nice inside and there seemed to be a good amount of seating (I took my food to go, so I was not dining in). I placed my order for a hibachi chicken and they even let me sub broccoli for the carrots.   I was expecting it to take a good bit of time, but my food was ready relatively quickly. The portion is huge. Decent tasting chicken, broccoli, and rice. My only complaint about taste is their ginger sauce is alot more oil based then what I am used to (and what other hibachi places typically serve).  Overall, great quick lunch spot with good prices. I think this will become one of my lunch time go to's in the future!"}
{"text":"Looking for quick, easy, and tasty Japanese food? You're in luck! Their veggies are one of the best I've had from a fast food Japanese or Chinese restaurant. And I love love love their rice. I could eat that every day (it's a good thing I don't for the sake of my waist)."}
{"text":"Use to be good for a quick hibachi lunch but the quality has since gone down. It doesn't help that with my Togo order they have gotten it wrong the past 3 times after clarifying it at the register. Of course I didn't even check until I got back to my office and by that time it wasn't even worth walking all the way"}
{"text":"I had the worst restaurant experience in all of the years that I've lived in Charlotte. Simon Lee was my cashier today and he is by far the worst person to work in customer service. My friend and I were at the epicenter and I wanted some scallops and noodles. We ordered our food and I got rice instead of noodles. I politely went up to Simon and said hey I wanted noodles. Can you please swap out the rice for noodles? He said no. Shockingly I asked why. He said bc they already made my order. Well, it's the wrong order :-(. He proceeded to say that if I want noodles I can buy a side of noodles. I told him I wouldn't do that bc he got my order wrong and just his attitude toward me was completely unnecessary. So I told him that I'd like a refund for my meal and my friend will keep hers because her order was correct (mind you both orders were on my ticket). He proceeded to get loud with me and said that he will only give me half of what I paid for if I returned the meal. At this point I wasn't even sure what to say or do next. I politely walked away with my food bc I was not going to waste something I paid for and I damn sure wasn't going to let Simon Lee steal my peace and my joy. Basically BEWARE of this \"horrific made up Policy\" at Fuji Hibachi & Teriyaki Grill. They have no respect for customers, are not willing to work with you or own up to their mistakes and honestly this is NOT a restaurant that I would ever visit again due to their terrible customer service. Mr. Simon Lee, I hope you speak better to the women in your life and the customers that come into your establishment and management needs to coach you on your customer service skills."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you would expect. Pretty good, quick hibachi chicken, shrimp, etc. Reasonably priced and clean. Good lunch spot."}
{"text":"Must try!! Best Habachi in uptown!! They also offer other specialty items. I eat there at least once a week. It's very convenient for me bc I work in uptown. They're fast and food is delicious! Haven't tried anything there I haven't liked yet."}
{"text":"Review is for bubble tea... for 3.95 the green tea bubble tea is horrendous. Green tea is way too sweet and the Boba is hard and small... a rip off."}
{"text":"Two days ago I got a meal to go . I ordered fried chicken wings, mushrooms and fried rice. When I took it home, I found that the food was just as delicious as it would have been had I had eaten there !!! The food there tastes like it has been prepared with love!!! Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"This review is about the bubble tea only! I went there this afternoon they didn't have the bubbles for the bubble tea so I went back later tonight and ordered one. I literally finish the drink in like 2 sips. It's like the cup were mainly ice. It's not fresh tea neither I saw the girl squeeze some milk tea looking thing off a bottle and mix with water and ice. ,I finish my tea and all the bubbles were stick together in between ice cubes. Totally not worth the $4"}
{"text":"Mush carrots beef on rice no thills here. Sign on the door says 8.95 but charged 10.95 saying the sign was old. Much better options around for the price"}
{"text":"Good, quick food, but they close 15 minutes early. Make sure you're there before 8:45!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Ordered hibachi, an egg roll and chicken wings. The only thing good was the chicken hence the two stars. The egg roll was gross and the hibachi had mushrooms. Instead of mixed veggies that are usually given it was only carrots. This place is not the typical hibachi it's an express place like you would find in a mall."}
{"text":"The taste is a pretty good. The price is over priced. Yea it's probably because of the location but you can probably go to a sit down, hibachi table for a few dollars more and way more food. And there combos don't have steak shrimp and chicken.  It's good but except to pay almost 15-20 a person easily."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Shrimp sauce is insanely sweet it tastes more like it belonged on a dessert. Fried rice also flavorless. Veggie hibachi consisted mostly of cabbage or lettuce. Even the bubble tea was completely flavorless and mostly just tasted like milk."}
{"text":"I have ordered take out from here twice now and both times ended up getting sick. Both times I ordered their hibachi steak which tasted great but did not turn out so great... definitely do not recommend. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The staff is nice but the food is average. At this price point I expected more flavor and food in the to go box. If there is a next time I may eat in versus taking it to go"}
{"text":"I dropped in to Fuji Hibachi & Teriyaki Grill on a Friday just before noon and ordered chicken hibachi.  I had about a 5 minute wait for my food.  My chicken and veggies were perfectly cooked and the shrimp sauce on the side was a nice addition.    One thing to note, if you do eat in the restaurant, you'll likely smell a bit like a hibachi grill when you go back to work.  I don't think there's any way around it, as the grill is visible from the dining room.   Overall, it's special only in that it's exactly what you expect.  Fast, convenient and tasty."}
{"text":"Order 2 hibachi chicken and 2 side of noodles. Called in my order. Picked up 15 minutes later. It was fast and hot... if u order a side of noodles , I would suggest if you are going to share. Save some money and only order 1. Because the give you well over enough for two people.  However, I did enjoy my meal. Especially for the $20 I spent for hibachi for. I would definitely order again."}
{"text":"The food here is both delicious and plentiful. My husband really likes the hibachi combination: chicken, steak, shrimp, with sweet carrot slices, mushrooms and fried rice. I like that, too, but I love the shrimp and scallops hibachi combination. The dishes are served with a little cup of sauce, akin to thousand island, which is great. We've tried other dishes that were all good, these are just our favorites. Everything is served fresh within 5 - 10 minutes and brought to your table if you ask. We also do quite a lot of takeout from here. It's always wonderful. Fuji's is located on the second floor of the EpiCentre complex on College St. between E. Trade St. and E. 4th St."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like this place, I really did but I cannot say anything good about it except the shrimp sauce was good. Miso soup...watered down till it ever so faintly tasted of it's name sake. Hibachi shrimp with fried rice.  The shrimp are grill cooked, no hibachi.  The rice was super over cooked & seriously under seasoned, even bagged soy sauce & mustard didn't help it.  Canned sweet carrots, which were ok by me & no broccoli like on the menu but they offered mushrooms (I can't eat those). The portion size was ok but if the food has no flavor, who cares really? I'm sad it's not as good as I'd hoped it would be.  I may try it one more time because sometimes everyone has an off day but IDK."}
{"text":"I'd rather wait for an hour in line elsewhere than to come here for lunch. Please, save yourself from getting sick! I'm not sure they know how to properly cook rice, because the rice I received were wet, mushy, and smelled spoiled. It was the weirdest experience I've ever had. I'm no rice expert, besides the fact that I'm Asian and grew up eating rice my whole life, lol, but that's surely not how it's done. Meat was bland and overcooked. I mean I just can't seem to get anything to taste right without scrunching my face with every bite.  You also had random people (probably owner and some friends) just hanging around the register and even making their way back to the kitchen to make themselves lunch, DURING lunch rush. Obviously no one cares about the place. This is just a quick option if you're craving Japanese for lunch and in the area, but even if I am, I would rather go down the road for better options."}
{"text":"As far as express hibachi goes this place is awesome.  good prices, good portions, and good food.  i go there regularly and the food is fast and and staff is very accommodating for my need cooking the food clean when i'm dieting and need lower calorie food."}
{"text":"Ordered Hibachi ckicken. It was really good. Tender and juicy, just wish they put more mushrooms in there... The carrots were nice and sweet. One concern: it seems they don't refrigerate their shrimp sauce. It was all sitting in a tub on the front counter. Shouldn't it be held at 40F or lower? Quite a lot of food for around $7.50. Good price for Epicenter food."}
{"text":"Whenever I am uptown and have a taste for fast Japanese this is my go to. I wish they had more locations out in the suburbs. They have a great chicken hibachi and their shrimp sauce is great."}
{"text":"It is great. Never really thought of eating here earlier but now that I kmow its a great place to eat I will surely come again."}
{"text":"This is my first downgrade. Their consistently subpar food combined with their increasingly poor service has nixed this from my lunch options as they are clearly never prepared to handle a lunch rush. After several lack of judgment return visits, today was my last straw. Already understaffed for the lunch rush with one cashier, it is no time to take back-to-back call in orders when the line is already to the door, preventing customers who are standing right there from getting in their orders. Maybe there was an underlying assumption that since we were in there, we were going to wait and complete our order. They were wrong. I and at least two other customers left to go somewhere else. While waiting in line, ordering came to a halt for at least four call in orders. The back-to-back ones sealed it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have been waiting to try out Fuji Hibachi Grill since they open a few weeks ago. As you walk in you are welcomed by the friendly staff! That is always a plus! The restaurant has modern and sleek feel to it. What better way to eat lunch and watch some football. The food was so good I ordered the chicken and fried rice combination and was amazed by the portion. HUGE! I am so full I think I need to take a power nap. I will highly recommend this place to my co-workers and friends! Definitely coming back for round #2"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Charlotte to get hibachi chicken. The food is excellent and the portions are fair for the price you pay. The chicken is never rubbery or tough. The rice and vegetables are always fresh. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for quality Japanese food."}
{"text":"Impeccable food. I had the hibachi salmon and my wife had the teriyaki shrimp. We ate inside and the manager or owner brought our food to the table. It was a great atmosphere, great decor, and very neat.    We absolutely loved it."}
{"text":"After few hours at Charlotte Pride Festival, I stopped at Fuji in the EpiCentre to grab something to eat, and there's nothing quit like unwinding at after long day with good take out food.  Chicken Teriyaki:  - Generous portion. - Delicious! - Good price.  Four Yelps."}
{"text":"Second-time customer. The first was a lot better. There was one guy working behind the line cooking. The cashier/waitress is everything that's wrong with the restaurant industry. She obviously did not want to be there, and that ruined my experience. Her depressed mood seemed to have taken this whole place down.   After she had taken my order, she went back where she was not found for another 20 minutes doing whatever. I've watched as multiple future customers walked in, and waited, then walked out as no service was granted. The cook kept going in the back to alert her, but she took her time. The cook had about four other meals completed and sitting on the counter until she returned to hand out everyone's order. It was an awkward experience.   Overall, food is very tasteful (she forgot to include the sauce, so I had to make due with just soy sauce, as I took mine to go.)  Beware that they may include MSG. It's always that feeling after eating hibachi style rice/chicken and feeling stuffed, then wait an hour and you're hungry all over again. Though I can not say for sure, this is just a guess. Don't expect to do much work or be productive after indulging in this meal, it will weigh you down."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we finally have somewhere to go to that opens late on the weekend! Who would want to travel far for some late night cravings after a night of going out while at the Epicenter? Not most of us, so this is definitely a plus!   I absolutely loooooove loooove the decors here (props to them!). The ambience is so warm and welcoming when you first walk in, not to mention how modern and stylish it is! Their portions are HUGE compared to most places I've been to.  Wait...there isn't even that many quick hibachi places around here in Charlotte so to have a place like this got me excited. I used to go to a college town that has \"quick-fix craving\" hibachi grill restaurants all over town so when I came back to Charlotte, this city was definitely lacking that in this department.   As for foods, my favorite combo was the shrimp & scallops.  They are not itty bitty shrimps and scallops you see other places use in their meal. It was pretty decently sized. Thumbs up guys!   Oh! Don't forget to order their salmon salad as well if you want to stay lean. It's healthy, fresh and delicious! Good portion like I said. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Please don't go here. The food is just so gross. This has got to be the worst Chinese food I have ever had. I got the Chicken Hibachi and all parts were just bad.  Like really bad. The chicken was so so salty and dry. The rice had a strange taste to it and was very greasy. I didn't even try the carrots, they were just sad looking. The mushrooms were mushy and probably came from a can. There was no good part of the food and after eating some of it I just gave up and threw it away.   The price was low but the food quality was awful. Ugly on the inside and service was ok. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"My office eats here at least once or twice a week. This is the one thing we look forward to each and every week. I would recommend the hibachi steak and chicken with shrimp sauce.  If you have the time make a point of having a meal here"}
{"text":"Always ordered to go and I absolutely love the Salmon entrée! the people are very friendly parking free for epic center is what sucks. I wish they had other locations"}
{"text":"We were assured they would be open till 7 and they were closed at 5:30. Messed up our plans."}
{"text":"I wouldn't expect these prices at a place like the epicenter.  It's definitely a great value, especially with the amount of food you get.  The service was good and the food came out quick.  I ordered the teriyaki shrimp and it was delicious. Great place to hit up after AA5."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place a few times and never had any issues, but today was awful. I ordered my food as I have in the past and stepped to the side to wait. I even coaxed a coworker to come along. We're waiting, and waiting, and waiting. All of a sudden his order gets called, mind you he ordered AFTER me, and mine is still not ready. One of the cashiers asked what my order number was and then they realized someone had given my order away. I was clearly annoyed and so was my co-worker. The manager or owner, I'm not sure, did apologize, but clearly made excuses about how the order was given away. Of course that had absolutely nothing to do with me! He ordered my food be cooked again, but not once offered any kind of retribution or customer service for the fact that it had happened in the first place. I had an appointment to get to and of course never got a chance to eat. I mean this guy didn't offer so much as a spring roll, not to mention a refund for my wait. I will not be back because my time is money and they have used enough of it.   The stars are for the cashier who truly seemed apologetic for the error, but the manager's customer service sucked."}
{"text":"Basic, average, hibachi food. I order from Fuji on Postmates because it's reasonably priced and a quick delivery. The chicken can sometimes be a little dry or lacking flavor. Not the best hibachi I've had but certainly not the best either."}
{"text":"I rather eat wall paper paste....I don't understand how you can mess up teriyaki chicken with broccoli and fried rice!!! No flavor/bland. Chicken was dry. I had a heaping size of broccoli stalks.....and maybe two florets...wtf? I wouldn't waste my time or money here, there are other places in the epi-center to fancy."}
{"text":"Don't expect too much AT ALL. This is one of the \"on the go\" spots. Definitely not a date spot. But it's fast and cheap. I usually just order this from Door Dash to not deal with the parking garages .. this is located in Epicenter"}
{"text":"After giving Fuji three tries, I felt a review was deserved. Overall, everything I have tried has just been okay. The hibachi options are HUGE! I have tried a few different options, chicken being my least favorite as it was very dry. The shrimp has always been cooked well, as well as the steak. I will say, do not waste your money on the filet upgrade..I did not notice any difference from the regular steak option. Overall, my favorite is the shrimp, with the amazing shrimp sauce, onions and mushrooms as I find the carrots are a little too sweet. The fried rice is cooked perfectly and again is a large portion. Service has always been good, nothing great, so again Fuji in my mind is good, however, nothing I would crave & want all the time."}
{"text":"I ordered Postmates from here and was actually excited bc it got here so quickly. Unfortunately the steak and shrimp hibachi  was seriously lacking flavor. The steak was cooked well but had no seasoning at all. Was hoping for better but at least the shrimp sauce was good, that helped."}
{"text":"Great location, right in the Epicenter... however the day I visited, there seemed to be some technical difficulties happening.  First of all, it was prime lunch hour time... walked in... and there was one person in the whole place.  I would think there would be a decent crowd (at least half the restaurant taken up)... but not the case.  The other issue was that there was smoke EVERYWHERE.  Maybe their vent fan was malfunctioning that day, but the front doors were thrown open and some floor fans were blowing the smoke out.... something tells me that it has happened in more than occasion if they have the perpetual floors fan blowing the smoke out the front doors.  Still determined to try this place out, I walked to the counter and order the hibachi chicken with mushrooms.  Pretty standard for all of these places.  Good to see it was cooked to order so I waited about 6-8 minutes... trying to decide if my eyes were watering from the smoke or from hunger... (mostly smoke).    The food was OK, but nothing to write home about.  Solid lunch option if they figure out their ventilation system.  The price did seem a little high for an okay hibachi lunch dish.    I do want to say that the employees were busting' their butts to get the food out.  The poor girl at the front was taking orders and delivering them out to people at the few tables that got occupied.  I may have started a trend that day when they saw someone enter into the smokey arena and still order food.  It was not for lack of trying."}
