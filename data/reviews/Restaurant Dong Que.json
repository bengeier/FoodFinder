{"text":"Very very good spring rolls and pho. Huge portion of meat in the soup. Delicate delicious noodles. Great, flavourful broth. Everything is fresh. Super friendly, neighbourly service. Been here many times and will continue coming back."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town, but don't expect a smile..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years and can't fault it. The grilled chicken and vegetable soup is super flavourful and generously portioned. The menu is varied and extensive, prices are very reasonable, and it takes no time to receive your food once you've ordered it.  Yes, it's mildly tacky with the oriental music and flowery tablecloths, but it's cozy and it works. Service is prompt, water glasses are always full, but as another Yelper mentioned, don't expect a smile!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, had the typical Vietnamese combo meal the first time around, with grilled chicken, beef and shrimps and then the beef pho the second time around.  For the combo meal: the starters (mini beef pho and imperial rolls) were very good - the soup had a nice flavour and the rolls weren't those tiny skinny things other restaurants try to get away with. However, the actual meal was a huge let down; the meats were covered in some kind of BBQ sauce like ??? So that was super disappointing, considering how many of these combo meals I've eaten.  The beef pho: came back a second time as I'd really liked the mini beef pho that was served with the combo meal, however, it tasted different; perhaps it was not the same broth? In any case, it was still a good hot bowl of pho."}
{"text":"So I looooved the food here, my husband thought it was okay, my mom and aunts were not big fans.  There were about 9 of us and we ordered to share.  Started off with the Banh Dap (sp?)  - mouthwateringly savory meat accompanied by fresh veggies like cucumber, lettuce, pickled carrots, large crispy shrimp chips, and jumbo soft chewy rice noodles that you use to wrap up everything.  This also comes with a fish sauce based dipping sauce - nuoc mam.  Then, we ordered the Bo Nhung Dam (sp?) - platters of raw beef that you cook yourself in a boiling pot of broth.  The dish is accompanied with fresh veggies and rice paper.  You use the rice paper to make your own rolls.  This comes with a shrimp paste based dipping sauce that is heavy on the garlic and yummy on the taste (IMO) - some places add pineapple to the dipping sauce but this place did not.  We also ordered dessert ... the desserts were less than \"meh\"  The flan was passable - I'm sure my homemade flan is just as a good - if not better.    Tried the Che 7 Mau - a spin on the traditional Che 3 Mau (tricoloured dessert).  We tried to figure out what all the 7 colours were but couldn't.  The beans were also a little salty?!  According to my husband there was not enough ice or coconut milk.    Meal came out to $165ish (before tax and tip) for 9 people - this included 3 orders of Banh Dap and 6 servings of Bo Nhung Dam and 8 desserts.  I was stuffed and happy.    Not sure why others in my family were not as satisfied as I was ... I loooved my meal!!! :)  ps.  There is NO highchair ... my son fell out of the booster seat and gave us a scare :("}
{"text":"This is the first place we went to when my boyfriend and I arrived in Montreal. So filling and so good! Great for cold days :)"}
{"text":"Definitely worth stopping for if you are in the neighborhood. Probably the best pho in the area. If you are eating in the restaurant, be hungry."}
