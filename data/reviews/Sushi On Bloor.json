{"text":"Great cheap sushi.
Love the bloor street roll and the wakame salad.

Edit: The Bloor Street Roll is sushi with very little rice. A big slab of salmon wraps around the outside with basil and salmon roe in the middle. Really wet. Really fishy. Such a good roll."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sus.hi joint near home! Always a line up but it goes fast and is worth the wait. Best is their miso soup and salad dressing on their house salad that comes with every meal. They serve this to you before you even place the order! Medium sized sushi rolls, reasonably fresh fish. I always go for their lunch deal for 6.99 always dynamite roll with avocado 2nd roll, or I would get a bento box meal that comes with salmon sushi too. staff are pretty much on auto pilot, but that is ok. I am not too demanding for special service. I just like my food."}
{"text":"For a discount sushi restaurant, this fits the bill! They give generous portions and their soup and house salad is good. Their salad dressing is just the right combination of soy and sesame - very addictive - I am trying to replicate the recipe at home. The service is average to slow, but never intentional rudeness that I have experienced - more that they are overrun with fewer servers than they should have... but if you need something - just ask for it. I like their teriyaki bento boxes, and the S7 lunch special - spicy honour roll & unagi roll."}
{"text":"Not the most amazing sushi in town quality wise  but it's pretty good and the portions are generous. The lunch specials are where it's at ...nice variety of affordable options when you are feeling peckish."}
{"text":"I love this place a lot, they are pretty much my to-go sushi restaurant! They have awesome service and amazing staff who remembers my order ever time I go with my family. They automatically serve you your miso soup. Their lunch specials are insane! A super good price for a big portion of tasty food! As well, their menu items are delicious too. I love their sushi pizza, chicken fried udon, and salmon dragon roll. Oh yeah, they give you free ice cream! One downside is that they are always packed! One time I entered the restaurant at 11:50AM and it was already packed. It was absurd because the restaurant opens at 12PM. Oh, you smart and early people."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best sushi places in Toronto. The prices are great, and the sushi is great for the price range. The service is results-oriented."}
{"text":"Went looking today for \"bento box lunch\" with my daughter. Went for the Bento boxes specials big mistake. No veg bento box option with lunch specials, ordered off the menu. It was terrible.The rolls were ok but the veg bento box was not.
Daughter's salmon bento box was ok which was a lunch special (no rolls included).
We've had much, much better lunch experiences when looking for a bento box lunches in Toronto. 
Maybe the sushi options are better?"}
{"text":"We went there and had 3 different rolls: smoked salmon roll, unagi roll and shrimp tempura roll, all of which tasted like rice. The smoked salmon roll had almost no fish in it. They were so cheap with that. We also sashimi appetizer which was OK. Over all the fish was not that fresh and none of the rolls we had were good. Not going back there ever."}
{"text":"My bf and I love this place and dine here weekly. It is the best value you can get in DT Toronto and the ingredients are very fresh due to their high volumes. The service is also very efficient. The only downside is wait times can be long during peak hours - but the fact that you get 10% off takeout orders more than makes up for that."}
{"text":"I'm gonna go ahead and say 'Meh'.  I'd give them an extra star for the cheapness and free ice cream but there are a lot of other places that I could eat better and cheaper food.  It's not that it's bad, but I feel that all of those sushi places on Bloor are pretty much interchangeable in both food and price (although, I would actually say that New Gen has a more creative menu).

SOB is always packed, which should be a testament to quality/value but it's also related to poor service.  I'm usually pretty forgiving of slow service in busy venues as long as the food is good or staff is apologetic --unfortunately this didn't happen on my recent visit.   I attended a group event (for eight people), yet despite our reservation we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  Service was not only slow but also sporadic; everyone at the table received their plates at different times and one person didn't receive their food until everybody else was finished eating.  It's not as though any of the food choices were overly complicated, there were no substitutions and some people even ordered the same thing but received their plates ten minutes apart.  This to me, is the worst and least forgivable service infraction --the purpose of going out to dinner as a group is to share a meal together, not to stare hungrily at the person across the table because they have food and you don't."}
{"text":"When my friend recommended this restaurant he said that this is all about good food at a good price. He was right. Portions are good, service is excellent and the sashimi doesn't taste like it's been sitting in the fridge forever. If there is a downside is that this place is so popular that there is always a bit of a lineup.

They got me as a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Great sushi for good price. Definitely a good pick for almost any social meal. The quality of the fish is always great and fresh. Plus they have butterfish which is great. They also deliver, it has become my go to sushi delivery."}
{"text":"One week ago I would have given this place five stars but then I called today at 4:30 to get my usual S7 lunch special they said not only had the price jumped, but they had cut the hours from 12-5 to 12-3! From now on, Its new generation sushi all the way!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. The fish is fresh, prices are dirt cheap, portions are HUGE and it's absolutely delicious! Hands down the best sushi value in town
Went for a late dinner and was seated within about 10 minutes. Food was quick to arrive and tasted really good. They give you a free soup when you sit down and a scoop of ice cream when you're done. How awesome is that? The only con about this place is that they're sometimes understaffed and are too busy to accommodate customers. Another note to also remember is that the place gets packed by 6:00pm so expect a 1hr wait time where lineups are out the door. I really don't know how they afford to sell their food for so cheap."}
{"text":"Good value for what you pay for.  You're not visiting for the best quality in town, but it's far from the worst I would think.  I really enjoy the food every time I've visited since I first saw it 15 years ago - they are consistent!

I will say that their teriyaki is the best in the city so far, specially the salmon and the beef, in quanitity, cooking style and taste.  I've been to a lot of sushi restaurants in the city and I've yet to come across any other teriyaki that remotely compares.

Service is OK, sometimes pretty good, and other times it's minimal but it's still good enough that I continue to visit.  It can get pretty loud in the place, on either floor; I like to avoid dinner line-ups by arriving before 7PM, or making a pick-up order."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. Not amazing though. We also ordered the croquette and it was nice. Didn't seem to have much filling though besides potato. 

The unagi lunch special was a disappointment. Hardly any unagi and the rice wasn't seasoned at all. Tasted like normal rice.

The service was terrible. There was one waitress who seemed to hate her job and forgot to get me my drink. Had to wave down another waitress instead. They never really check in with you either they just walk by and you really have to wave them down for service while they pass by you. They don't even glance your way."}
{"text":"It has price going for it.  The meals are fairly cheap, especially the lunch specials.  The food itself isn't really amazing, but for the price you should be expecting McSushi anyways.  I went when it was not busy, and the service was fairly good."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars.
We had a terrible experience at Sushi on Bloor. We had people coming over for dinner, so we ordered a party tray. We drove from the west end of Mississauga to pick it up. We called the restaurant on the way there to check if it was going to be ready, and were told by a man who answered the phone that the order had not been taken. He said no one made the order. We then told him that we were going to be arriving soon to pick it up, and asked if he could start to make it now at least. He said \"no\" (seriously) and them hung up on me! I called back and he finally agreed to start making the tray, saying it would not be ready when we got there, more than two hours after I placed the original order.
We waited in the car for over a half an hour before our dinner was ready. When I was going to pay, I asked if they were going to give me a discount for all the waiting and hassle and screw up on their behalf. The man laughed at us and said \"I don't want to\" repeatedly. We asked who he was, and apparently he is the owner. I told him I was unhappy with them messing things up and he said he \"didn't care\". 
I won't be giving any more of my hard earned money to a place with a jackass of a disrespectful owner like this. Plenty of better places around, that actually care about customer service. Don't support a terrible place like this."}
{"text":"Basically, if you've ever walked through the Annex at dinner time, you've probably seen a line up outside of this place.  Why? Because it's cheap.  Really cheap.  And the portions are big.  

The quality of the food is good, but not amazing.  I've had better tasting sushi elsewhere, but I've also paid twice as much (if not more) for it.  

Regardless, the food here is tasty.  I'm a fan of all of the rolls (especially dynamite roll and mango roll), and the chicken katsu u-don (fried chicken with thick noodle soup) is really good too.  The seafood salad is also a hidden gem.  So is the salmon pizza and grilled squid.  The more I think about it, there are a lot of great items here, but I'll stop there.  

These guys do takeout too, so if you're craving cheap sushi but don't feel like waiting for a table, you may want to consider that option too."}
{"text":"The food is good for cheap sushi but some of the waitresses have no dinning experience and obviously don't understand what customer service is. I called in today to grab delivery and I let her know from the beginning and obviously she has an accent and it's hard to understand, most of the stuff she sounds like she's speaking gibberish. So, I continuously have to be like \"pardon me?\" and she got frustrated with me.... How unbelievable, when I'm the customer.... Anyways, I know which one of the girl's she is, she's the little tiny one with the rude tone to everybody. She really shouldn't work there... 
Anyways, I'm done with my spiel - rolls that are good here are the saba maki, crunch maki and rainbow roll... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Sushi on Bloor is always packed.  Whenever I walk there, I always see the other sushi places maybe half filled while Sushi on Bloor has a lineup.

There's definitely a reason behind the lineup.  The restaurant has a wide variety of sushi offerings for an extremely good price.  Being located in the Annex with loads of students, it's no surprise why its packed.  

With this place, you're essentially getting what you're paying for.  The fish is mediocre.  Fish in Toronto is certainly not the freshest (Vancouverites living in Toronto - we don't live near an ocean and we don't fish from L.Ont., get over it) but it still decent.  The fish at Sushi on Bloor is nowhere near the best sushi I've had.  The maki rice/fish proportion is way off and I once ate a piece of sashimi that I'm sure was just defrosted an hr ago.  

Again, you get what you're paying for and when I have a massive sushi craving, this place satisfies it.  

On the plus side - you get a scoop of ice cream.  Win!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Toronto. Be prepared to wait in line on busy nights, it's worth it. 

Standard atmosphere, fast service, amazing prices, and the sushi is the best."}
{"text":"Yesssssss! 5 stars. For sure. This place is the BEST! At least for take out... it can take a while to get a table, I hear. But that's for a good reason! The food is AWESOME, the prices are unbeatable and the delivery is quick! I've tried sushi from other places but always come back to Sushi On Bloor because the price for the quality and quantity can't be beat.
My faves? The crunchy roll and BBQ mixed set -- yum!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap but yummy lunch this is the place to go!
Their special lunch menus go on until 5pm which is awesome cause' you can still get your sushi or teriyaki under 10 bucks. I usually order S7- which is the spicy tuna and unagi roll that comes with miso soup and salad for $5.99. Seriously, it's never disappointing! H1 is really good too.. it's pretty much the bento box but cheaper (and excludes the tempura) either way you get teriyaki chicken/salmon with salad, miso soup, avacado roll, and fruit for $5.99 which is great! 

Ps. The one thing I never seem to understand about this place is that they don't often use their upstairs dining even when they have long lineups. This brings me to my next point...if you're dining for two you're fine for the lineups but 3-4 people it's usually about a 10 min wait (either way i think it's worth it). 

Pps. They don't accept debit! Yes, it happened to me once and i had to run across the street to the atm :("}
{"text":"We had Great sushi, free miso soup they have quick, good service and welcoming atmosphere. They offered us ice cream on the house when we finished it. I will definitely go back to try their teriyaki but we had sushi and sashimi for the first time"}
{"text":"Offering good sushi and sashimi at very reasonable prices.


 Wall of awards from various newspapers and magazines attesting to their popularity. Seating wait times of over 30 minutes not uncommon.


 Decor was nothing out of the ordinary, but the food portions were generous and extremely fresh.


 Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Just moved on Oct 1, 2015, to the west corner of the same block it was on. Slightly larger, but it doesn't appear to have a second floor. Nice and open with a neat accent wall of lumber. Toilets are on the lower floor, like at the old place.

This place is consistent: busy, loud, quick service, large portions and cheap. There is a wide selection of rolls, sushi, sashimi, bento boxes, and noodles to choose from. At night, my go-to dish is a bento box of teriyaki, sushi, salad, tempura and miso soup. Lunchtime specials are also good, cheap, and filling."}
{"text":"This is not the place you go for authentic sushi or good rolls. However, I only get their sashimi meals or Bento boxes, which are pretty standard wherever you go and are hard to mess up. Their sashimi is always fresh, and the portion is great.

Other than that, their rolls are huge and have a lot of rice-to-other stuff ratio. Sometimes the rice in their sushi is messed up with too much vinegar. The rolls off their lunch menu are especially poorly prepared."}
{"text":"It's pretty good... Except, there are always fish eggs wrapped up in even the vegetarian ones. Not a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Its not the best sushi I've ever had, but its definitely not the worst. No AYCE option so can get pricey pretty quickly. Service is solid though, and the ambiance in the restaurant is nice!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food at a good price.  Service is relatively quick too!"}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place in the Annex. Yes there is always a wait, so be prepared to stand at the entrance for a few minutes (15-30). Fear not, because it is totally worth it. 

The Ikayaki is my 5 dollar (crazy good value!) late night staple, and the sashimi bronze combo (when I'm feeling splurgy) for every other occasion. Even just getting a single roll will fill you for under 10 dollars because each one has eight pieces. Everyone gets free soup and tea after being seated. Just the thing to warm you up! 

The sushi quality here, and some people fight me on this (I'll reluctantly admit) is FANTASTIC. I only really eat sashimi, so it is important to me that the pieces are cut thickly/generously, and they are presented beautifully! Clean and fresh--give it a whirl. 10/10!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go for Japanese food. It's affordable and delicious. Service could use improvement tho. At times it feels like they are rushing you and trying to push you out the door."}
{"text":"It's not the best place in the city, that's for sure, but it IS the best place in the west-Annex and judging by the constant lineup, it's not a secret either. It's really important that you time your outing to Sushi On Bloor well, or you could get stuck in one of those out-the-door lineups of theirs, or worse, seated by the door on a cold day during a busy time like that. They do take out, and delivery and they can get you in and out and fed in 40 minutes. Or, you can take your time. That's what's nice about it.

As far as the cuts, clean, with something for everyone. The price points are good and the sashimi is safe to eat. It's your average safe bet spot with no frills, and they can make spicy tuna maki without the mayo!"}
{"text":"Never found a better value for sushis elsewhere. Even the hosomakis are big and packed with fish. My favorite was the mango unagi roll. So delicious. The sushis here are classic nothing too creative but they taste good. Also free tea, miso soup and ice cream! Ambiance is a bit cold though."}
{"text":"I love this place! The menu is good, I personally recommend bentos! They are great! Huge quantity for a small price ($12)!
The only annoying thing is that every time I go there I need to wait for 10-15min before getting a seat as it is very popular.
Plus it is in the Annex so once you're done with the restaurant, you can grab a drink or attend a concert in the area :-)
PERFECT PLACE!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have had in Toronto so far.
Quality, price, presentation, selection - all great.
Will be coming back and hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Last time we went to Noka and had not such a good experience while seeing this place jam pack thinking it must be good. Got that chance to try today, and they were busy on the lower level, but had seating up-stairs as well. We weren't that hungry but wanted to give this place a try.

We ordered their 'Golden Maki Set' that consist of unagi, spicy salmon, dynamic shrimp. We also added a Uni handroll and a few sashimi like hamachi, maguro, butterfish.

The server was quite attentive and helpful. The food is very filled with rice. The fish seems fine, but the freshest I've taste, but still good enough. Just ordering those, we still spent $40 easy. 

There are lots of sushi places, so I don't think I'll make the travel to come back, just b/c I fine nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going to this place for years.  The quality is always top-notch, and even though it's super-busy most nights, service is fast and the food is consistently excellent.  If you phone in a takeout order, you get to skip the lines!  

The price is also very competitive for what you get.  I consider Sushi on Bloor to be among the very best \"bang for your buck\" sushi places in Toronto. The price to quality ratio is what sets Sushi on Bloor apart!"}
{"text":"Went last Sunday with some friends.  We've never been and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Don't be discouraged by the lineup, it went quick.  Abundance of selection, great quality and quite inexpensive.  Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"The best of the best of sushi in Toronto! There's a reason there's always a long lineup (they do take reservations!) The food is just so fresh and delicious and so inexpensive! Always my go-to for sushi and I always leave super happy and full. Best sushi pizza and spider rolls in the city!"}
{"text":"Great Quality! The best sushi I have ever tried! Very polite and good staff! The quality of the food is very good. Price is very reasonable. 

Food comes with free tea and miso soup. The tea is awesome! 

Bento box, sushi rolls are great!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi at low prices. 
You can even make your own combo this summer.
I'm definitely returning."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's always packed and most of the time there is a queue, but I don't mind waiting to be seated.  One of their best dishes is the salmon sushi pizza.  Is it a Toronto specialty as I never had it before."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi places. The food is great and very reasonably priced, and when you dine in your meal comes with free miso soup (pretty much as soon as you sit down), japanese green tea, and ice cream at the end. My best friend and I have stuffed our faces at this place for $25 including tax and tip.

It does get quite busy at peak times, which means sometimes waiting for a table, but it is worth the wait.

They also do take out and recently started delivering, but I haven't ordered delivery from them yet. The only reason they got a 4 instead of 5 is that occasionally when I get take out they have given me the wrong type of maki. This has happened twice out of many times ordering take out. Still, if you order take out I suggest opening the bag and checking your food before you get too far from the place."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Tasty, cheap, free tea, miso soup and ice cream during dinner. Always fresh!!! as there are always loads of people. 5.99$ lunch special is awesome. Seriously, I love this place."}
{"text":"Went with a friend today for lunch. We were seated within a few minutes and quickly provided tea and miso soup. We ordered the $7.25 lunch special which comes with a small salad, soup (which I suppose was the miso soup), and two sushi rolls. The Crunchy Roll, Dynamite Roll, and Salmon Rolls were pretty tasty. We also ordered the Soft Shell Crab appetizer which was decent but not as flavorful as I had expected. 

Service wasn't amazing but we were served quickly, and the quality of the food was great for the price."}
{"text":"This place is so good and affordable, we usually eat here twice a month.  

They have huge portions and their bento box always comes with miso, 6 pieces of sushi, salad, tempura, choice of meat and ice cream in the end.  Thinking about it just makes me hungry and full at the same time! 

I often get the Deluxe bento and upgrade my sushi to Casa Loma roll for an extra $. so worth it! I would have given this place a 5 but the wait to get a table is crazy frustrating.  They dont take reservations and waiting in line in the middle of winter is BRUTAL.  

All in all, do give this place a try.  You wont be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, the prices are more than ok and the staff is friendly  one of the best Sushi Restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Always have large portions. There is a lot of rice around the sushi. You fill up on rice too fast. Cheap prices. Recommend if youre in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to get sushi in Toronto. I've been coming here for almost 10 years (yikes) and I just can't get enough of their lunch special. For $6.99, you get a miso soup, salad, and two delicious rolls (14 pieces) of your choosing. The portion sizes are huge and the sushi is so fresh it just melts in your mouth (omg, I want some right now). Super filling and great value for money! 

Service here is not particularly friendly, but the staff is typically pretty efficient and attentive enough that you always have a cup full of green tea (on the house). If you're here during dinner time, make sure to ask for a free scoop of ice cream (red bean, mango, or matcha green tea flavour). It's included with most orders and makes for a nice way to finish a meal. Also, this place gets super busy during lunch hour so be prepared to wait in line!

TL;DR: I love this place.

My only complaint is that they're not located closer to me."}
{"text":"Even though the name 'Sushi on Bloor' would suggest that the establishment serves exceptional sushi, the truth of the matter is that their sushi is in fact quite horrendous. In fact, it would be much more honest if the the restaurant were called 'Everything-but-sushi on Bloor'. Though the sushi is not very good, the other warm entrees are decent for the price and are better than most of the other sushi restaurants in the Annex merely because their competition is so subpar. That being said, the restaurant is always full and lineups long because those who have not truly had a taste for sushi enjoy the other reasonable Japanese food available. The decor is not that great either. Many couples I know take their dates here but with a little bit of research on Yelp you can do a hell of a lot better than this place."}
{"text":"Honestly the best sushis in the area. Be prepared to wait a litte for the place is often crowded but it's totally worth it !"}
{"text":"It's busy, friendly, loud, consistent, and delicious. There's always something about each dish that sets it apart from other sushi restaurants, and I can't always tell what it is. The miso soup tastes just a little richer than other places, the salad dressing has just a little more flavor, etc. I love the grilled squid and always order that to share, and then I experiment with rolls or bento boxes. Everything has been delicious and fast."}
{"text":"The food is really great I recommend the deluxe bento box. It is reasonably priced you can't go wrong. If you go around 6:00 or later any night it is pretty annoying because people usually sit for a while. Their system is also annoying because you just get a number."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


I should mention that my reviews for Sushi On Bloor and New Generation Sushi are identical, as, after many visits to each, I find they are beans from the same edamame pod.

There's much to say about Sushi. It's raw fish on rice, and it must be prepared by hand and with care. That helps justify the expense, even though it's customary in our society to equate \"value\" with \"man, I'm full.\"

Which is why places like Sushi On Bloor and New Generation Sushi continue to be overflowing success stories. They provide the same ample feeling you might expect for $15 at any bistro, pub, or family restaurant, but, under the cover of \"sushi\" the average consumer feels that they had a healthy meal, or that they've experienced something avant garde.

The sushi at this restaurant barely has any taste, except for a hint of the saran wrap it sits in before a chef slaps it on some rice, and/or in a box, and on your table. Let's be frank: most Bloor Street consumers drench the rice in soy sauce and wasabe paste anyway.

The fish here is barely distinguishable. They make some extremely tasty special rolls ($10) but these tend to use cream cheese, avocado, tempura, or other filler that, again, makes the fish indistinguishable.

So it's hard to rate this place other than to say: expect a wait, you won't pay too much if you order smartly, and you'll probably get tea at the beginning and ice cream at the end.

3 stars"}
{"text":"I've been to this place for a few years now, and I have to say they probably have the best portion size for their value with bento boxes. Highly recommend it, the food is above average but for it's price. It's 5 star... As for their other menu items I cannot say as I usually go there for their boxes. 

Free parking on side street above bloor."}
{"text":"If you head over to Sushi on Bloor any given night during the dinner rush, you will see a line going straight out of the door.  Luckily enough, with two floors of efficiently used space, the wait for a table is generally going to be pretty painless, especially if you have a small party.  

I can't argue that it's popularity is unfounded - the place is nice to look at, the staff is quick and friendly, and the food is pretty good.  I've heard some hard core sushi fans complain about the sushi, but I like it very well thank you.  Then again, I', someone who likes lots of appetizers with a few maki rolls loaded up with all kinds of fatty extras (tempura bits, avocado rolls, etc), so I'm not exactly demanding plate after plate of flawless sashimi either.

The best thing to do if you're set on S.O.B. (as I lovingly call it) on a busy night is to step in, leave your name and ask if you can come back later.  They will usually gladly give you a return time when a table will be ready, and you can then use your time to go grab a beer at futures or something.  Polite as Torontonians are, I've never seen such bad behavior as people dealing with the hosts at SOB.  Which is ironic considering there is hardly a dearth of sushi in the Annex.  

My favorite items on the menu are pretty basic but also very tasty: the crunchy roll, spicy salmon roll, and the Salmon Dragon Roll is really nice if you like unagi (eel). They also have a lot of vegetarian rolls and appetizers, so your veggie friends aren't stuck eating only cucumber rolls and veggie tempura.  For non-sushi items, you can't go wrong with the cloquette (crispy fried balls of mashed potato with veggies inside and served with dipping sauce), chicken karaage.  The bento options are forever popular as well.

My very favorite part of a trip to SOB is not just the food, but the service.  Unlike some of the more bare-bones sushi houses, SOB without fail will bring you tea or water when you sit down, and miso soup soon to follow.  If you order bento or a combo, you will also get salad in short order.  And at the end, they give you ice cream on the house even if you just got an appetizer.  So, worth the wait in line after all!"}
{"text":"I've been going here regularly over the past yera after reading some really good reviews. It's not \"fancy\" sushi but it is damn GOOD sushi! The portions are great, the service is fast & friendly, the fish is fresh and good quality (nice pink tuna!) 

The bottom line is you can eat a really good meal for $10 - $15 and be really satisfied and leave quite happy. Anytime I feel like sushi or Japanese but don't want to blow tons of cash this is the place I frequent. Especially love their handroll set, super tasty. Tuna roll for $3.50 you cannot beat that!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I was in college. The food here is quite cheap and pretty good for sushi, though I've had better. The place is often packed, so you can be assured that they have good turnover, something I worry much when I get Japanese food. In particular, I enjoyed having their sukiyaki, which for 8.95 is a huge steal for dinner. Not only do you get a very flavorful meal, the portions were large. They also have good bento box meals.

Other things that may be interesting is that they do take-out (which can be a godsend on busy days). They're also very close to the Subway, closer to Bathurst.

In summary, if you want a good place to see friends on a budget, this is a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"The fish was fresh, service was ok and the Udan was tasteful. The price was really great. Reminded me of good sushi in Vancouver."}
{"text":"Sushi is fresh and rolls are delicious. I hate it when fish feels wet but never happened at this restaurant. This is a very hectic place all the time. I normally go here at night and it becomes really busy. Service is good though. Foods come out fast and staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing place! 
Come here all the time with my family, order takeout for parties and even get get catering for larger events. Everyone loves it, and is always satisfied. The sushi is fresh, cheap, and comes in generous portions. Its great to always be welcomed with hot miso soup and finish your meal with some delicious cold ice cream. 
Come hungry and you won't be disappointed, come less hungry and you'll take home your lunch for the next day."}
{"text":"Great food on their lunch special at a great price for $6.99. I always either get the chicken teriyaki, or the chicken katsu on rice or 2 rolls.

Only complaint is that they do have an upstairs level with additional seating but it's never open during lunch for some reason. So if you are not there early then you are stuck waiting for at least 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer here but over the years the quality has taken a dive. Last night went for what will be my last time. Ordered a bunch of rolls and a salad. The rolls were all falling apart, basically tasteless and all seemed a bit off and the salad was meh. The best part of the dinner was their salad dressing that comes with the salad and the free ice cream. Yes it is dirt cheap but we ate less than half and felt pretty gross after. I'd recommend skipping this place and going somewhere with less of a name and better quality."}
{"text":"This place gets crazy packed and sometimes there's even a line up. I don't think it is because of the quality of their sushi, it is more because of their prices.

$3.75 for a spicy salmon maki roll? It's rare to find prices like this! As an avid spicy salmon sushi lover, it isn't the best by any means - just mediocre. When I ordered this, it came with the seaweed wrapped on the outside of the rice and a piece of salmon with a dab of spicy mayo. What can you expect from the price, right?

I'll keep coming back here just because I'm always in the area and if I'm feeling for cheap sushi and to get my money's worth, this place doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Best sushi in the city. Fish always fresh and good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We got the supereme bento box tonight, which was average for the price (the rolls had way too much rice and the fruit tasted like dish soap), but this restaurant's service was literally the WORST. 

The waitresses were so rude and the service was just shockingly bad throughout the whole night. I know their business is good but when we've just finished eating our tempura with still like 1/3 of the food left, she came and brought our bill to us. It literally shocked us that they were so blatantly trying to make us leave. 

Then to make matters worse, when we went to pay, because we split the bill, we ended up with about 6 dollars in quarters and the waitress was so lazy that she didn't count our money right and said that we paid less than the bill. My friend then had to go up to her and tell her that we were expecting about $8 back in change, which she started yelling at my friend for insisting such a thing. It wasn't until my friend counted the quarters IN FRONT OF HER FACE that she believed we needed change back. 

We were appalled by this restaurants waitresses and their hostility and to be honest this dining experience RUINED THE REST OF OUR NIGHT. Overall, cheap average unauthentic food; HORRIBLE service. Yeah don't ever expect us back there again."}
{"text":"Even with my limited sushi-eating history, this wasn't the best sushi I've ever had.

The freshness and flavour of the sushi was not on par with what you'd pay for and expect in a more formal setting (I got the sense the food was pre-prepared), but both my rolls were still entirely delicious.

The food here is made even better by frankly outstanding prices. I ordered $10 worth of sushi (the tuna roll and the ''crunchy roll'' - salmon, avocado, mayo, tempura and tobiko) and couldn't even come close to finishing everything. If you choose to go for a combo you'll be even more astounded by the value here. Ah, the joys of cheap, fast, healthy, tasty food!

The service was friendly, and very fast despite it being a super-busy Saturday night. Don't let the fast-food look of the place and the cheap prices fool you - you will still receive complimentary appetisers in the form of miso soup and delicious Japanese tea before your main sushi dishes arrive. Fantastic.

We were slightly tempted to go to the fancy Sushi Couture across the street instead, but having compared prices and reviews, this was a more than adequate trade-off.

BlogTO sum this place up perfectly : The best CHEAP sushi in Toronto."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for lunch on a Monday, looking for a few tasty rolls. We'd been to Big Sushi before, but we wanted to try something new in the area, and after looking at some yelp reviews, we decided on Sushi On Bloor. I was so impressed by Sushi On Bloor, that I actually created my first yelp account so I could give them the favourable review they deserve. 
There are a lot of sushi places along this stretch of road, and Sushi On Bloor looks really standard from the outside. Small, a bit run-down, nothing to stand out really. But once we went inside, we saw that it was clean, the decor contemporary, and there was enough room to seat a fair amount of people comfortably. We were immediately seated by helpful staff and shown the special lunch menu and the regular menu. 
The lunch menu was an incredible deal - for around $6 you can choose one maki and one roll from a few different options. Most of the maki and rolls were either 6 or 8 pcs. It also comes with the best miso soup I have ever tasted, and a salad with romaine lettuce (none of that iceberg crap) and a flavourful homemade dressing. I should mention that the soup was given to us right away along with tea, and when we ordered, the salad came immediately after. The sushi came fairly quickly after we ordered as well. We got salmon maki, crab maki, dynamite roll, and honour roll (spicy salmon with avocado and cucumber I think). All the sushi was delicious, especially the rolls! They were a good size as well - big, but not too big that you couldn't eat it all in one go -and you could tell that the ingredients were fresh and the rice perfectly cooked. We were so satisfied, we even had 6 pcs leftover!
The service was excellent, they were friendly and frequently filled our cups of tea and cleared our plates as soon as we were done with them. The bill was only about $15 before the tip. We will definitely be coming back here, for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This is a really popular spot. They opened at 12am Saturday and I arrived at 12:00, it was already almost full.
I ordered tofu steak, Casa Loma roll and eel rice.
The tofu steak is delicious, hot enough for winter. I like the way they seasoned it with onion and garlic. Great job.
The Casa Loma roll which has eel and cream cheese in it was average. They should reduce the portion of the cream cheese, it made the sushi taste greasy, I even felt sick when I ate the last two. The ginger they offered was really bad. I know not many people eat it, but still they need to select it before hand to the customer. One piece of ginger was really hot. The purpose of the ginger is to \"reset\"your tongue, but this one thumb my tongue.
The eel rice was way below average. The portion seemed large, but there were only five pieces of eel. They put a lot of sauce which for me is the spirit of eel rice. But it is not the special sauce made for eel rice, it tasted more like soy sauce. Blend, salty and tasteless. They even put pickle in it. I don't understand and they didn't even taste good.
The service is slow, I need to remind them in order to get my rice. I raised my hand, but it took some time to get noticed.
Overall, average food, low price."}
{"text":"Very good value and tasty, well-made sushi. $6.99 - $7.99 lunch specials including soup and salad. Good service. All the tea you want. Only qualm is that I come here so often that I could use more variety in their lunch menu...

Note: Prepare for line ups on weekends."}
{"text":"Ah, Sushi on Bloor, how long have we known each other?  For how many years have I been eating your shiitake mushroom tempura?  I don't remember, but it had better be many many more.  

I've been going here for years, especially when I lived down at Harbord and Bathurst and it was only a 10 minute walk.  Getting take-out is a fantastic deal, since you get to bypass the ever-present crowd at the door and just pick up your sushi and get out with 20% off.  Wow.

I finally got back here today for the first time in a long time, and was pleasantly surprised to see that they hadn't gone and skimped on the quantity of fish in the rolls or significantly upped the prices.  A few things, by a little bit, but I can live with that.  Dynamite rolls are still $5, which is a whole lot cheaper than anything resembling it in the Bay Area.  For my money, Sushi on Bloor is still the best quality and value of about any sushi place I've ever been to.  Nice portions of fish, good menu, awesome shiitake tempura that I haven't been able to find elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi place in the whole city, I take all my friends here. The only problem is that its too small so if you go around dinner time prepare to stand in a line. It is cheap and very fresh, no place better."}
{"text":"Went here last week for dinner. My experience was pretty consistent with the other reviews. Great quality/price ratio. You can find better sushi elsewhere, but it'll cost you way more, and the stuff at Sushi on Bloor is still tasty. I would definitely go back in the future.

And apparently dessert is free? One of my roommates thought he heard the waiter say it was on the house, but the rest of us didn't really hear clearly so we figured he heard wrong. But it would certainly explain the weird look we got from the waiter when we said we didn't want any ice cream."}
{"text":"Great sushi and amazing value for money.  Turn around us quite quick as well.  Soup and scoop of ice cream is free with all dine in orders.  How cool! Personal favourites are spicy salmon roll,  dynamite roll and the rainbow roll"}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Price: 4/5
Service: 2/5

WORST WAITING EVER. We were group of 3 and last in line and once we got to the front, the waitress totally ignored us and literally called people behind us until we were the last ones again! We were totally fine because others were group of 2 but there were group of 5 behind us and when a table of 4 got emptied, the waitress called the five people behind us and get them to sit at the table! NEVER GO THERE unless you are a group of 2."}
{"text":"There's just about always a lineup out the door to get a table here.  The Sushi Pizza is amazing. I used to get a lot of takeout from this place - the Bento Box is a great deal - but I eventually found it too much of an ordeal.  The person on the cash would ring up peoples' cheques for five minutes, ignoring the lineup of takeout patrons, and it would end up taking 10-15 min. just to give exact change with a tip (why?!) and get your food (and they often gave me attitude).  So, I tried New Generation down the street, found the prices similar, the quality comparable if not better (never had food poisoning from New Gen - Sushi on Bloor, twice) and the staff friendly and efficient.  While I wait for perhaps five minutes during really busy times, it's well worth it.  I would say, skip Sushi on Bloor, and go to New Generation sushi, half a block east towards Brunswick, on the same side of the street."}
{"text":"This place is... okay.

I do come to this place quite a bit for sushi and for the price, really there's not much to complain about. The sushi is fine, the bento box is pretty good, the sashimi is passable but it's also not great. The worst thing about this place is probably the service. HORRIBLE. However, it's getting better with new waitresses. On Bloor street this is probably the better one which is why I still frequent this place."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times with friends. It does get pretty packed so if your in a big group it is best to make reservations ahead. I always order a bento box with some sushi on the side. the chicken teriyaki is pretty good it comes with chicken, rice, assorted vegetable tempura, salad, soup, and 6 sushi rolls, and your choice of dessert for around 9 bucks which is an incredible deal.

You get great prices and exceptional food except the service is horrible. They take forever to get back to you if they get back to you at all. They aren't friendly or welcoming. 

Also the last time I went I got a huge hair in my food. They took the item off my bill. but it just turned me off from ever eating here again"}
{"text":"Unless one is capable or in favour of shelling out Nobu prices for West coast fish, here on the East coast, then this spot ain't for you. 

Though for the locale, portion sizes and prices--you can't beat it. Although the decor is bordering on bad Ikea, and the long lines are reminiscent of bread lines in communist Russia (especially in the winter), the service is fast and the food is consistent. Probably the largest pieces of sashimi available for the price tag, Sushi on Bloor is a quick fix for that crack-like craving one gets for sushi.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's cheap. Don't expect amazing. It certainly won't change your life. But it's cheap."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing sushi! It's a amazing restaurant I will definitely come back again! Great Atmosphere and very calm. When you walk in they bring you FREE soup in a flash!  They have everything! From maki to Shrimp Tampora! THIS PLACE ROCKS This will be my new hang place!!"}
{"text":"This is problably one of the best sushi place in town. Good service, good food and good price."}
{"text":"Their avocados seem to be perfect in taste and texture every time, whether in a sushi roll or on a salad."}
{"text":"Delicious and very affordable food! You get green tea and miso soup when you are seated. Dinner time is always busy, so expect a line up at the door. The line is usually fast, the longest I had to wait was 15 minutes. The service is okay, not excellent or bad but I'm not complaining because it's so cheap and the food is soo good. Their bento boxes and dinners can fill you up for about $12-15 max. When I get the salmon teriyaki dinner, you can hear it steaming still as they bring it to you. That's when you know it's made fresh and hasn't been sitting there for too long. I don't know about their sushi since I don't eat sushi. With most meals, you get free ice cream (green tea, mango or red bean flavour) when you're done. If you don't want to be literally sitting right beside someone then don't sit on the 2nd floor. The tables are so close together. If the 2nd floor is the only one available, I wait until a table is empty on the first."}
{"text":"Cheap, decent sushi spot at Annex area.  Not wide variety of fish selection but the freshness and portion are alright.  Typical Chinese run sushi spot so don't expect anything authentic or spectacular.  The ambiance is clean and comfy but try to come early to avoid lineup.  Lunch special seems to be more worth it as it comes with salad, soup and ice cream.  The strange thing is regular price item only includes soup and salad but no ice cream, which is a draw back.

Service is quick and efficient, so don't expect anything beyond that.  Overall a good spot to go for if one craves for sushi and doesn't want to spend big bucks on omakase experience."}
{"text":"Not sure why I haven't written a review of this before now...
A friend of mine brought me here at the beginning of January and I have been back about 4 times with other groups of friends.

I am personally not a big fan of sushi - I have an issue with the texture.
BUT - I am definitely a fan of their Bento Boxes. As with everything else on the menu, the price is right. Their Bento Boxes are one satisfying meal for 8, 9, or 11 dollars.

As others have said - this place is always busy!!
If you have any warning that you will be dining here, call and make a reservation. I have had no trouble getting a table if I have a reservation. Without one you would probably wait an hour or so for a table - so just plan ahead!

p.s. in case others haven't mentioned it - tea, miso soup, and a scoop of ice cream (mango, green tea, or red bean) to finish everything off :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant has garnered excellent reviews every year and is quite popular with the local residents. Be warned though- the lineups are so long, I had to wait over 30 minutes and it was 2pm. When I went there, they had a lunch special promotion- a choice of sushi, fried rice, sashimi, etc for a price of CAD 5.99. The service is good and staff is friendly. It is definitely one of the best sushi I've had for a while."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, if you're looking for  a real, authentic japanese food experience, sushi on bloor isn't the place. It is a good place for some quick, reasonable sushi at a very good price though. We were told Sushi on Bloor was the go-to sushi place, so we tried it out on a Friday night. The 35 minute wait was definitely worth it. Our waitress was very quick to serve us, and I was very surprised when our order was brought to us in 5 minutes. We had a decent meal, and 3 of us were stuffed for just $32. Glad we went, would recommend if you're looking for a fast sushi lunch or dinner that's won't hurt your wallet."}
{"text":"Great sushi!
Never been disappointed with their service or food. 
The atmosphere is very casual, nothing fancy. 

If you are going to have a casual lunch/dinner, I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"It is a gem in the area.  Nowhere can you find a decent Japanese restaurant that is not all you can eat type but you pay less to fill you up.  It has been there for a long time and always line up.  There are 2 floors.  The service is fast.  You will be served with Miso soup, salad and at the end ice cream of your choice all included in your meal no matter what you order.  We have 5 people with rainbow, dragon roll, sashimi and sushi platter, seafood udon, tempura and seafood salad.  The sashimi can be described as double the size of a regular Japanese restaurant.  Fish is fresh and cool just right. It has a large portion and a relatively cheap price.  For the same order, expect to pay at least 50% more elsewhere.  

Highly recommended for the food quality and price.  It is a bit congested.  But you have to know that the restaurant has to be profitable to serve you in the coming years."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! Great bento boxes and such reasonable prices, highly recommended."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Sushi on Bloor on a Saturday night - we were told that the wait would be about 20 minutes and were given a ticket number. We waited just abut 20 minutes and were bought to our table. As mentioned in previous reviews, miso soup was brought to our table right away; tea and eater followed shortly after.

The menu was expansive and reasonably priced - we ordered a few rolls, the sushi pizza, and the beef bento box. The food was absolutely delicious and well-portioned, and service prompt. The ice cream was a nice touch to end dinner. 

We had no complaints about dinner and Sushi on Bloor definitely is on the list for future Toronto visits."}
{"text":"I don't know why the review for this place is good, but I would definitely NOT recommend anyone who wants good sushi to go this place!!!

its NOT fresh, clouded, and the staffs are not friendly at all.....
The sashimi I tasted here was just.... indescribable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YUK.

the only good side? - you will get a scoop of icecream..."}
{"text":"Friday night and there was a long line up. We were seated upstairs and unlike what some other people have said, I found the service was EXTREMELY slow. I needed to flag down the waitress to even get out orders put in. 

Ordered the sashimi bronze combo and a bento box. Portion sizes were huge. However, the sushi rice was too soggy. The same goes for the tempura - soggy and also cold. Sashimi was average, nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for take out only. I ordered take out recently for an office lunch. We all got the lunch special which comes with soup and salad and a choice of 2 rolls. I chose Dynamite roll and salmon maki. I also ordered a tempura appetizer. The soup was lukewarm (the travel time from the pick up to the office was a 5 minute drive). The salad was drowning in its own dressing. I was hoping that the roll and maki would be better. Well, it was a-ok. I mean, for the price ($6.99) it was a pretty good deal. I will probably give them another try, but I will dine-in next time."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!!  I have been ordering from Sushi on Bloor for over a year with no problems but just this past weekend I spend all of Saturday in the emergency department, sick with food poisoning.  The last thing I ate (which was approximately 12 hours prior to the start of the incessant vomiting) was delivery from Sushi on Bloor.  I don't wish this type of agony on anyone and I think this place has become negligent.  I've learned my lesson never to eat here again or at ANY cheap sushi place for that matter."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on a bad day, maybe I ordered the wrong things, but Sushi On Bloor, with all its rave reviews, didnt impress me.

The complimentary miso soup was great but the cones I ordered were barely full, almost no fish and the same amount of rice, my first bite was nothing but nori.

I also ordered a few rolls, I even asked which rolls were the most popular and ended up with salmon pizza roll and the university roll.

The salmon pizza roll was good but the university roll was small and again, had little content.

I am willing to give this place another try but the portions this time were puny and the taste wasent so amazing as to justify such meager portions."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The food is always so fresh. The only downfall is that it's very busy at times."}
{"text":"Cheap, casual, edible, always a line up out the door.  Lunch specials before 5pm.  No complaints.  Fast food."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for at this place. We ordered the sushi silver and sashimi bronze combo. While it was nice that the combos also came with ice cream (not noted in the menu), I didn't feel like the quality of fish was that fresh and the rice in the sushi/rolls were a tad on the large and soggy side. The price is pretty good for what you get, but I think I'd rather spend the extra few bucks for better quality. Service was excellent though, 5 stars there."}
{"text":"Don't come here!! I want to keep it all to myself and it's always so busy. Just kidding. Sushi on bloor is great. I pretty much always go for the lunch special (honour roll and salmon & dynamite and avocado)!! It used to be $6.95 now I think it's $8.99. Still worth it!! Maki pieces are large and filing. Free spicy mayo upon request is much appreciated. Staff is so busy I feel bad for them sometimes but they make it all work! I really like the newer location. The wood walls are fun and there is a lot more seating...but still expect to wait :)"}
{"text":"Confession: 

Literlllay I mean LIteraly I haven't eaten here in years. Used to go all the time. Gave this spot the Lllamia one time after I had a maki roll that looked like it had been rolled by a child. Not like a child who was some sort of sushi apprentice child, no, but a random child who had come in with his caretaker and had expressed an interest in running the kitchen forever and had been given this job. The rice was floppy, the nori was floppy, the fish was crispy. This isn't even a good place to get \"gross\" sushi. Check out Mazzy Mazz at Bloor and Ossington if you want good \"gross\" sushi OR go to NewGen which everybody knows is better. 

Now in the interest of epistemological probity, I should admit that it's possible that Newgen is the loser, and that this place is the winner...BUT I just can't believe that. I would rather believe that actually some people just taste wrong. Or don't taste at all. That's what I would rather believe. LITurally."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi joint when I'm not feeling like paying a lot, and just need a quick pick-me-up of red dragon or dynamite maki rolls. Bento combos at lunch time use to be only $5.99 (included miso soup, salad and tea) but I think they've raised it to $6.99 or more. It's not really the highest quality, but for the value it's not bad. The place has so much traffic that you can tell their seating and washrooms need a major facelift before it starts to deteriorate. When it gets really busy, the space to wait outside is always packed and there is no one manage the queue. Some people would rudely butt in line and sometimes it's a complete zoo. When you come in at non-peak hours, it's bliss."}
{"text":"awesome price and great taste!
good quality and lots of it for one serving :O
definitely coming back!

only negative point is the servers not so friendly..."}
{"text":"***3.5 Stars***

Want cheap sushi eats in the Annex, Sushi on Bloor is where it is at!  You can get a whole bento box for under $10!!  The portions are huge, two can easily share a bento box.

Service is sub-par but I think it is due to many partons and high table turns.  Note though, they do take reservations for groups.  Consider Sushi on Bloor for a group event.

Their sushi is a bit ricey but still fresh.  I will definitely be back for future meals in the Annex!"}
{"text":"Affordable, ok service but the food itself left much for want. 

We ordered the Gold Maki Set and the Yaki Udon Dinner.

Received Miso soup and hot tea right away which was great. 

The rolls arrives. It had too much rice and they either overcooked the rice or used glutinous rice instead of sushi rice. Each piece was a mush of rice in the mouth. Horrible texture. The seaweed on the rolls was also too tough. It takes a lot more pressure then usual for our teeth to even puncture through it. 

The Udon was slightly too salty and the chicken was so dry, it was like eating cardboard. Lots of veggies though which was nice. In the end we ate everything and left all the chicken. 

Got free ice cream in the end. But it didn't make up for meal, so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This is very popular sushi restaurant in Annex area.

I have tried every sushi restaurant in annex area.

Sushi on bloor is not bad.

On the every weekend evening there is always line up so I wondered how great it is.

I have been here 5 times maybe..or more than that for last a few years.

I think their food quality and service is not good but price point is good!!

I actually like their lunch special!!
It is from 5.99 and even until 5pm which is amazing deal for customers!!

They serve food very quickly so that is another good thing.

And they have good variety of appetizers.
I usually order ika yaki which is grilled squid ..so good!

For the sushi and sashimi.. It is almost Ayce quality of fish ..so dont expect for quality.

I used to think this place is over hyped than their quality and service.

But  this is good place for quick and cheap lunch meal."}
{"text":"Very affordable sushi! It was okay and the service could be better. It was hard to call the attention of the servers although I know they were too busy."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for the service. A friend and I were in a rush so we called ahead to put our order in. 15 minutes later we walked in and in under 30 seconds were seated and given our entire order. The waitress was quick to refill us up on tea and the sushi was made well. Would defintely reccomend."}
{"text":"Ate here again with a friend about two weeks ago, always leaving this place full! Their spider rolls are not the best I've had, there are other places that make them better, but you really can't beat the price! Love this place!"}
{"text":"If I am craving sushi for lunch, Sushi on Bloor is my go-to restaurant. At 6.99 for their lunch special, it's hard to say no! 

They offer hot meals, bento boxes and sushi combos. I always order the S2 sushi combo - it comes with dynamite and avocado roll. Every lunch special comes with salad and miso soup so it ends up becoming quite filling. 

Back in the day I used to love Sushi on Bloor, day and night, but now I think it's simply a good cheap spot for your sushi craving at lunch."}
{"text":"Sushi on Bloor is one of the cheapest sushi places in the city - although the quality is pretty bad, which I didn't realize until I started going to better, more expensive places. If you're on a budget, this is the place for you - plus there's free ice cream. Avoid the lineups by going early."}
{"text":"This rating is based on my first visit (I've been to this location twice). Prior to eating here I've asked friends about this place and they recommended it based on the low prices for good food, and I thought: Why not give it a try?

My first visit to the restaurant was back in January, a few days before my birthday. I went with one of my friends who highly recommended the place. As soon as we arrived, there is a line up, which is expected for what I assumed was a popular sushi place. We waited close to 30 minutes for available seats. As we got closer to the front we asked the server handling the people waiting if we could get a booth, we were told that it was for reserved parties. Okay, fine. We end up getting seated right next to the door.. which is annoying because it's winter and people are constantly coming in and out of the restaurant..

Food: After we were seated, our server offered us cups of hot tea. My friend noticed my cup had a lipstick stain on it... 
I ordered the Supreme bento box with the grilled salmon teriyaki and a Sunomono salad while my friend ordered the Deluxe Bento box with chicken teriyaki. A few minutes after the server leaves with our order she says that they're out of seafood salad. Okay cool. We waited about 15-20 minutes for our food to arrive. It wasn't too long of a wait, and the food was filling but alright.. Fortunately we got our free scoops of ice-cream at the end of the meal, I got mango.

Service: At the end of our meal when we wanted our bills, all the servers were ignoring us! We tried flagging down any of the servers but they all would just walk past. We had to wait half an hour for our bill to finally come and for us to pay and leave.

All in all, I think I'll look for other Japanese/sushi restaurants to eat at."}
{"text":"The best \"budget\" sushi in TO. Been going here for years, and it's a great value - fish is fresh, prepared well, portions are good. Whether you go with nigiri or maki, they've got a lot of great choices. Only negative, as is with all of these type of sushi joints, is that there is a lack of variety. Not a big deal of you like salmon though, you'll get plenty of that. 

I've lived in Japan, so I'm not going to say this is the most delicious sushi available. Far from it, but for the price, there is none other like SOB!"}
{"text":"Great value! Seafood salad for $6?  An entire plateful, piled high of mixed greens topped with a variety of sashimi and bits of seaweed.  Delicious and filling.

I also tried the mango roll and the crispy roll.  Both were pretty good, but I prefer my rolls to be bite-sized and these were both gigantic.  I was once told you should eat sushi in one bite, and I managed, but it was a challenge.  Also, the rice in the rolls was a little dry.

So, having been to Japan and back, I can't say this is the best sushi I've ever tasted, but I also wasn't expecting it to be.  What Sushi On Bloor does deliver is excellent value.

Bonus: I ran into an old high school friend here!  I will forever associated SOB as the restaurant that re-connected me with \"Mark\"."}
{"text":"Terrible food. This is not Japanese food at all. 

The restaurant is not clean, very noisy and busy. 

There are way better ones in GTA."}
{"text":"I have been going to sushi on Bloor since I was 18 and moved to the city. I'm now 24 and moved to the west end, but will still make the drive and bypass all other sushi joints to go here! So many Vegetarian options. We got two miso soups, two green teas, a giant Bento box, and 12 special rolls (and ice cream for dessert) for 21.95$!!! I should add, the quality is great too. Everything came out fast and hot. Service was great too! Love sushi on Bloor :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here around 10pm on a Wednesday and the place was packed! We ordered 3 sushi rolls and a tempura udon and the total was around $36 after tips. When we were seated, we were immediately offered complimentary miso soup as well as ice cream at the end of the meal.

The sushi rolls were quite big and filled with lots of fish, but they weren't the most flavourful. The tempura udon was around $9.25 and came with a huge plate of tempura - a lot more than other shops. The udon came about 5-10 minutes before the tempura did (probably because the restaurant was super busy). 

Overall I was very satisfied with the meal and a great deal for the price! The menu has a LOT of options and a huge selection of rolls and hot food items. Definitely will come back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"amazing place with amazing prices
I mean there is only one staff a bit painfull and i think i dont see her anymore
but hey for the price I will take it :)
$7.25 you get sushi +soup+Salad+green tea
hummm I will not worry even if they dont answer my Hi...lol"}
{"text":"Good sushi in an area of town that has no shortage of sushi restaurants... good, fast, cheap and newly renovated -- this place went from being a dive to a destination."}
{"text":"After looking at all the high ratings of Sushi on Bloor on Blogto, I decided to try it and see for myself. Went there on a Monday night with my friend and it was so packed. We did not expect it to be so crowded on a weekday. Waited for around 15 mins and we finally got our seats!

The menu is quite extensive as you get all kinds of bento, rolls, maki, combo and udon soup. The price is really affordable too. After looking at the menu for a good 15 mins (haha I am always undecided), we ordered Veggie California Rolls ( 8pcs) and a Supreme Bento.

The food is pretty good (by my standard as I am quite picky, so is my friend who is also a foodie) and the waiters are all really friendly. 
Overall, a good place for affordable and good sushi!"}
{"text":"Great treats. They serve tea and soup as soon you sit down. Great prices for very filling portions. Ice cream they serve at the end is also free and delicious."}
{"text":"The best (and most affordable) sushi ever! I have to admit that most of the time I am there for a take out - but the ambience seems to be nice. The food is absolutely delicious! I've been a returning customer for nearly 15 years. The portions are quite generous. Food is always good. I am hooked! :)"}
{"text":"Best price for value!. Their bento boxes are what I order when i'm in a rush and want a bit of everything. If I get the craving this is where I go. I do wish that the city hadn't recently butchered the street parking or i'd be here more often."}
{"text":"Très bonne adresse pour les étudiants et jeunes actifs au budget serré. Les portions sont gigantesques et le service rapide. Le signe que le resto est bien : comptez 10 à 20 minutes d'attente.
Je recommande la bento box qui consiste en une portion de viande (bouef, poulet ou saumon) accompagné de riz, 4 suhis, des légumes frits et 2 quartiers de fruit + la soupe et le thé! Et une glace en dessert .
Si vous avez encore faim après ça faut opter pour les restos all you can eat!
Niveau budget comptez 13$ avec les tips. ROYAL!"}
{"text":"Decently good at a decently good price. Staff is hit and miss, but the place is so busy (usually.)

I return about 2-3 times a month as the price is right and the food is good."}
{"text":"Price: very reasonable
Service: ok
atmosphere: not fancy
in terms of the price, you can not find any sushi bar in Toronto that  serves such a good quality  that cheap! 
Most of the time there is a line up in front of the restaurant which is inconvenient."}
{"text":"Going to a vast variety of sushi restaurants in Ontario, Sushi on Bloor is definitely one of my favourites! 


This is an A La Carte style of restaurant, and the choices seem quite endless of what you can eat. There are custom creative rolls that are absolutely amazing.

After trying every single on the menu through multiple visits I can say this place takes the cake. The service could be a bit more attentive on the customers, but it gets busy quick and the amount of staff supplied does not always cover the demand from the costumers. 

There is usually a line up on the weekends when it gets to busy especially for lunch so be sure to book reservations or get there a bit early.

The pricing on the sushi takes the cake. The sushi is priced relatively well for the amount of sushi and quality you receive from each serving.


Highly recommended and is a hot spot for \"Sushi on Bloor\"

Toronto Food Review"}
{"text":"Do this. Do this now. Stop reading. Go.


Delicious delicious heaps of sushi for cheap. I'm a fan of fasting all day and hitting up the veggie bento box. Related note, there are a surprisingly large range of options for the veggers out there. Sushi restaurant anxiety quelled. 

Also, not sure if they still do this, but be sure to ask for the complementary ice cream at the end. May be cheap, but sushi on bloor always hits the spot."}
{"text":"As a casual sushi eater, this spot is my go-to. The food is good and the prices are fair. One person can walk out feeling satisfied for about $15.

The restaurant itself is busy and loud,  so if you're looking for a quiet meal I recommend taking it to go. 

Tip: call ahead to avoid the inevitable lineup."}
{"text":"This is a pretty homey and cozy little place on Bloor (as the name suggests). It's also pretty affordable and really good if you're on a student budget. 

The two times I was here i got a Supreme Bento Box and the spicy tuna roll. Both of them were solid meals.. nothing extravagant or incredible but an adequate amojnt of hearty goodness. 

I got the beef teriyaki (rare) and the tempura platter was excellent. The spicy tuna roll was much better though. Crisp and lovely textures were involved, that added to the indelible richness of the sushi. 

Also the free miso soup and green tea is always welcome! All in a solid and reliable place for sushi close to the university."}
{"text":"My favourite, although I will have to consider my lunch time options now that their lunch specials have gone up by a dollar, and their competition has not upped their prices.

But I just love it here. Complimentary soup and ice cream, the best salad dressing in the world, big portions, and cheap prices. Also, they take reservations, so it makes it a good party place for me."}
{"text":"If you're in the area, this is a good place to check out for a quick sushi fix! Went here around dinner time with a group of six, since we were looking for sushi. Although the place was busy, we were still quickly seated and the servers took our orders right away. Went with their bento boxes which I think were pretty cheap for what it comes with: miso soup, salad, vegetable tempura, six rolls and choice of either chicken terikyaki or grilled salmon (10-12 dollars). They also gave a complimentary ice cream for dessert. Because it was busy though, it was hard to get ahold of our server, to ask for things like a refill on tea. Other than that, if you're in the mood for sushi for cheap, this is an option to try!"}
{"text":"For the price, the portions are pretty good.  You'll be full for sure.  However, sometimes the piece of fish is cut too big for the sushi and it's just not a good balance of rice/fish.  Not complaining that it's too much, but it's cut poorly (i.e. too thick) so you're chewing on a big chunk of tuna instead of savouring it.

I do prefer New Generation Sushi slightly further east of them.  But this is a better option if you really can't wait since they have two floors.  And if you just want bigger portions, this is a better place to go."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi and fair prices. I've never had a bad experience here, it's great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi in Toronto. Always so fresh and delicious. Sometimes a line up but it's worth it. Affordable and the new location is nice!"}
{"text":"If your after a cheap bento box this is the place!! 
If your looking for high quality food...why are u in the annex? 
You can get a bento box for around 11$ that will fill you up! That's lunch prices at dinner time! That's a win! Quality isn't the best, but then again your paying less then 15$ tax and tip in what did you expect?!?

Place gets busy and you may have to wait. 

Washroom is down a steep set of stairs if that's a problem this place isn't for you,"}
{"text":"It's been seven years since I was last here, and with good reason.  Luckily, we got there past ten pm, so there was no huge line-up of crazy, overzealous SOB freaks (that's \"Sushi on Bloor\" freaks...).

Service was quite good. We sat down and immediately got miso soup and tea, without even ordering yet.  Food came out fast.  

And then I found a hair in my sashimi.  

Second lucky event of the night, this kind of stuff doesn't super gross me out. Like my mother says, \"If you don't want a pinky in your soup, don't go out to eat.\"  And I don't usually say anything, but I casually mentioned to the waitress there was a hair in the food, and pointed it out.  She took the plate away, and went to the sushi counter to discuss with the chefs.  Then she came back and let us know she'd take the order off our bill.  Well handled.

Unfortunately, despite that good service, the food was bland and boring.  Except for the hair, I guess.  Added a bit of spice."}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi place. This place is always packed so you know it's good. I had the veggie rolls and they were pretty good but a little salty (I think it was the rice). Really nice atmosphere but at one point one of the customers spat on the floor??? Wtf... Will def go back!"}
{"text":"Sushi on Bloor is a staple Sushi place for many many people I know. While is may not be the best of the best, it is an absolutely solid Sushi joint that regularly has to manage line ups of customers waiting for a table. 

The food is solid, the prices are reasonable and the service is a good as one can expect from a place that's regularly busy. I wouldn't say that this is the only place I would bother to go to if I were in the area but if I were with a group and they decided to go here, I'd be confident that I'd come out happy in the end.

Enjoy! :D"}
{"text":"I came here a few months ago with a friend from out of town.  We normally head to cheap all you can eat joints for sushi but figured we'd try this out as there always seems to be a line up to get inside.  We did wait in line but since it was a nice summer day it was fine and the server called us within twenty minutes.  The food service was fast as well and the portions are huge.  THE MISO SOUP IS TO DIE FOR. I've never been a fan of miso soup until I had this one. Amazing.  Sushi was very fresh and so good that I didn't have to drench it in soya sauce!  Although sitting close by to other diners, we met a really nice couple who made some recommendations and even offered to let us try a couple of the dishes they were having.  I ended the meal with ice cream and even went home with leftovers."}
{"text":"I confidently say that this is the best sushi place in the city. Always fresh, great lunch specials. Complementary miso soup and ice cream!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend yesterday and we both had such a great experience. The food was hot, delicious and fresh and thee servers were really friendly. We both got bento boxes; I ordered the deluxe and he ordered the supreme with Salon Teriyaki. The portion sizes were very generous, he was completely full when we left and I took half my sushi and chicken teriyaki home. The presentation and taste was top notch as well. In fact, the lady sitting next to me asked me what I got and ended up ordering exactly the same thing because it looked and smelled so good. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Cheap choice with stable quality - well the Bloor Street Roll had less salmon roes than my first one, which was probably more than two years ago, but it didn't become worse since one year ago. And their seafood salad always kept the portion. Overall well worth the money."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi places in town! Their bento box and philadelphia roll are my favourite. Their miso soup... ! This is the place where me and my friends usually go after our long 12-hr shift! Will definitely recommend this place. The only downside is sometimes you need to wait T least 30 minutes to an hour to get seated"}
{"text":"Honestly I always end up going to AYCE sushi restaurants because other places don't offer what I'm usually craving for a decent price. Sushi on bloor was just a random restaurant my boyfriend and I ran into seeing how busy it was and how hungry we were. We ordered the two udon bowls, and three different sushi rolls (dynamite, philly, university). The rolls were huge and the udon had a very nice broth. And for what we ate it didn't cost much at all. 
On the plus side the waitress were nice and friendly but you did have to wave them down because of how busy it was, which wasn't a big deal at all."}
{"text":"I have lived in Toronto for over five years now, and I must say that I've eaten at Sushi on Bloor at least a few dozen times. If there is anyone that has more authority to comment on the dining experience at S.O.B., please raise your hand.

Last night I went to S.O.B. for dinner with a large group of people (12) for a friend's birthday. I have never before dined with such a large group at S.O.B. so it was interesting to see how the wait staff reacted to such a large group.  For starters, we had made a reservation for 8:15. When we arrived (on time for that matter), there was only one table that was open. We had to wait another fifteen minutes to be seated until the adjacent tables became available. Once we were seated, then everything else for the most part went smoothly. 

I would have to concur with most of the other already existing reviews on S.O.B. The reason why it is the best of the sushi options in the Annex is because it offers a unique combination of reasonable prices (dinner for two for approx $20), wide menu selection, and fresh fish. Also, a free scoop of ice cream after dinner doesn't hurt either. 

One aspect that all of the other reviews have failed to comment on is the noise level within the restaurant. As a result of the restaurant's design (ceramic floors, bare walls, high ceilings, tables tightly packed together), the noise levels can be quite high. Thus, if you are looking for a quiet, romantic dinner with your partner, then this is not the place to go for sushi. If noise levels are not a concern, then by all means, give S.O.B a go (and make sure you ask for some extra spicy mayonnaise on the side ;-))."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best sushi in Toronto, you won't be disappointed by this place. The best sushi ever! Love there rainbow dragon roll, sashimi, tempura, Japanese curry, gyoza and croquettes. FYI they serve free miso soup, green tea and ice cream and who doesn't like free food."}
{"text":"They are generally 3 tiers in Toronto when it comes to sushi. 

1-) Authentic, or as close to authentic as you can get in Toronto, and believe you me, it will be reflected in your wallet to have that experience, which is expected for any higher end restaurant.

2-) Semi-authentic, places that are middle of the road, which is also reflected in the price.  

3-) Cheap sushi houses. Not overly authentic or of the finest quality but they can still be fairly tasty. A very easy tell-tale sign of whether you are in one of these is the fact they will never, ever, serve you any real wasabi. Opting for the ogre-green tinted horseradish/mustard, instead.   

Sushi on Bloor falls on squarely on that last  tier. However, by now, SoB is a staple of the Annex and I have been coming here on and off when in the area for over decade.

A great and affordable place to drop by and enjoy some raw fish with friends, and by the line-ups during dinner time, it is fairly obvious that I am far from the only one who thinks that way.

Expect a bit of a rushed service as you can tell that although far from pushing you out the door, you can still sense that they \"would appreciate\" getting your table back sooner than later (like in most Ramen shops), especially during the dinner rush. Again, this is another tell-tale sign that you are on that 3rd tier. 
     
I would recommend it for a laid-back and relaxed dine-out. If you are in the hood, check it out. See what you think."}
{"text":"Free miso soup, salad and ice cream with an entree? Don't mind if I do!

This place is great. Sushi is amazing. Sushi rice is always made perfectly. Sashimi combos are an awesome deal! 

Currently my favorite sushi spot... I literally come there at least 4 times a month.

Customer service is good! Surprisingly fast service too! Casual ambiance. Highly recommend but don't expect fine dining."}
{"text":"All sushi are fresh and real tasty. Their rice tasted better than most sushi restaurants. If you are into sushi, 99% you will like this restaurant."}
{"text":"If I was on student loans, then this place would be a God sent. It is definitely one of the better OMG-it's-so-cheap sushi restaurants in Toronto. I have tried some of their chicken and beef dishes and there are decent too, a bit too salty for the beef. However I have noticed that budget sushi places use some really cheap quality chicken and beef for their dishes so I like to watch out for that.

The place is big with the student crowd, however all of my B.C. friends think that SoB is nothing more than \"Meh\" at best. I have to agree.

The biggest draw is not their great quality in sushi or amazingly slow service (they have gotten a few dishes wrong and their English is subpar)  but their price/quality ratio.

Oh, and they always pass their DineSafe inspections with flying colours is always good on my book."}
{"text":"I was so busy catching up w/ an old peer that I forgot to yelp while we were there last Saturday! She had never been & had heard all the hype about the place, I said to me it's like any other sushi place I have been to!

We both had bento boxes & I have her my salmon rolls, I had the cucumber rolls w/ my chicken teriyaki! We both agreed; it's no different. 

Good food, good service & fast service!"}
{"text":"Food and value = 5 Stars
Service = 3 Stars
(3+5)/2 = 4
When you come to this place, think of a place where students come to eat, but with good quality. The staff is not friendly, but at least they try to get your food quick, and they are constantly refilling your green tea mug if you had one.
The quality is really good, for the price you are paying... so don't come here to expect being treated like a diva, but rather, to have good food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Definitely not good sushi by any means, but it's above average for Toronto.  In other words, Toronto is all in all crap for sushi places so if you're going to get a craving and you need it then this is the place to go in the Annex.  Cheap.

there are always lineups because it's popular in the student ghetto.  Not really worth the line.  Call ahead and pickup your order, you'll get a discount.  The ambiance isn't nice enough to actually wait in line.  There'a a chemical-cleaner smell a lot of the times.  so at least you know they are trying to clean the tables.

For the price, and considering the quality of sushi in toronto, i'd say go for it."}
{"text":"This is the only sushi restaurant I ever actually want to go to. 
I never jumped on the sushi bandwagon and although I do like it, I'm not in love with it and think it's ridiculously over-rated. 

That being said, all one needs to do is walk past Sushi on Bloor and see that it is *always* packed to know that it's gotta have something going for it. Well, it does. 

It's cheap. 3 course meal for around $10 cheap. 
And, again for the NON-sushi-snob, it's delicious. I have never ever left not feeling like a fat cow, but that's a good thing (more or less). 
I usually get a bento box but for years used to get one of the numerous veggie meals-all good. 

Other than lunch, your meal also comes with ice cream at the end (I was very disappointed to learn it's not included at lunch time ....sigh..). 

I will admit that I've never experienced stellar customer service from any of the waiters and have instead been faced with a bit of attitude when one friend of mine insisted on getting a fork rather than chop sticks...
but it doesn't matter. 

I think most of downtown Toronto has been to this place but if you haven't, go right now."}
{"text":"Love this place. Salmon teriyaki is my favourite. Generous portions, free ice cream for dessert and all for a bit over $10. Service is usually ok, but can definitely get crowded fast."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi restaurant in Toronto. I love going to Sushi on Bloor for their Bento boxes because they are high quality and reasonably priced (under $15!!). I was surprised when they asked me how I wanted my beef cooked when I ordered my bento box! I asked for medium rare and they delivered! 

Aside from their quality bento boxes, their selection of sushi rolls are quite interesting and look amazing. I have had their Sushi Salmon Salad roll and it hit the spot! Fresh, delicious, and aesthetically pleasing.

Their lunch deals are also pretty good! I had their curry chicken katsu and I had so much leftover! Their portion sizes for their rice dishes are no joke! For under $10, I would say that this was worth it. I believe they also offer bento boxes during their lunch period and they are pretty standard and similar to what they serve during dinner time. 

Warning, it gets a little bit crazy on Saturday nights, so you might be waiting in line for a little bit. Service is decent and they offer soup and tea at the beginning of your experience!

Overall, best sushi bento box in Toronto for less than $15! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My favourite non-AYCE sushi spot. Good quality food, large portions, quick and good service for what I would consider cheap. They're also very consistent so you always know exactly what you're going to get."}
{"text":"Cheap Prices. Massive Portions!  I went there for lunch and it cost $6.99 for 6 pieces of salmon rolls and 4 salmon sushi.  I also ordered some shrimp and vegetable tempura because I thought I would be a lot hungrier.  My gf ordered futomaki and dynamite rolls.

The service was quick even for the place being jam packed for the lunch rush.  The presentation of the sushi was great and it tasted just as good as it looked.  

Go here if you are craving cheap and good Sushi!"}
{"text":"This place is always busy. I like the sushi, it iss very good quality and reasonably priced. I don't like the service aand how understafged they are."}
{"text":"I used to be a Big Sushi zealot, but after hosting an epic sushi night while watching Jiro Dreams of Sushi, I have converted to the calling of Sushi on Bloor. It's cheap, they're fast, the quality of fish is on par if not a a smidgen better than Big Sushi aaaannnd they're about a block closer to me. So win, win, win and win. 

Bear in mind I've only done takeout so I have little to no experience with the dining room itself. Although the couple times I've been in there to grab my food, it's been super packed with a cluster of people jamming the door.  In fact it feels like you're in a crowded little dim sum place on an early Sunday morning with the sea of voices and clinking of tea cups and plates. Not the greatest, but not necessarily unpleasant if you're used to how we asians do.

I recommend. Don't let the tacky sign dissuade you."}
{"text":"The Salmon Dragon Roll had unagi, tobiko, tempura bits, salmon, and avocado in it.  Presentation-wise, this received zero points from me.  The taste of the roll was quite satisfying and decent; however, the quality seemed very 'all-you-can-eat like' for us.  In fact, I think that this roll could have belonged in a all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant for sure.  The roll was also warm; too warm for sushi standards."}
{"text":"While I am loyal to New generation, they were unfortunately closed on today (Tuesday), not sure why. So I went to sushi on bloor and ordered off their lunch menu. I've been here a few times and have always been satisfied with the food quality and pricing! You can't go wrong if your looking for sushi!"}
{"text":"This is a consistently great, cheap sushi place. I always get edamame, spicy tuna, butter fish sashimi and some type of dynamite roll. My friend ordered the gyoza which was tasty if not a little salty. 

I never order alcohol so the bill is always really cheap. Def. One of my sushi faves."}
{"text":"Not the best Japanese restaurant but the food is good and the prices are ok. Service is usually good as well."}
{"text":"Good and popular sushi for Toronto!  Great price!

We shared the SUSHI AND SASHIMI and it was quite fresh.  The salmon was thick and juicy.  The kappa rolls were big!  We also shared the RAINBOW ROLL, which was traditional and big.  For appies, we shared the PAN FRIED GYOZAS and the IKAYAKI.  I was pleasantly surprised with the grilled squid because it was fresh and the sauce was this soy ginger sauce which was nice and light.

They give you complimentary MISO SOUP and ICE CREAM at the end.  The service was fast and attentive.  Overall, good vibes!"}
{"text":"Fast, cheap and reliable are adjectives that can be used to describe a number of things yet are ideally suited when discussing Sushi on Bloor.  I have yet to be disappointed by their trusted Sushi Bronze.  For the unbeatable price of $9.75 one gets 5 kinds of fish, 3 pcs of salmon roll, 3 pcs cumcumber roll and a spicy salmon hand roll and oh ya, Miso soup and salad too.

I should also mention their hours of operation.  SOB is open Friday and Saturday until 12:00am and throughout the week from 12:00-10:45pm.  With great prices and fantastic hours its no wonder this establishment has sat perched atop the competition in whats been referred to as the \"Bloor Street Sushi Wars.\"  Please don't let a temporary closure By Order Of The Medical Officer Of Heath dissuade you from sampling SOB and its many delights.  Its only temporary people."}
{"text":"Selection is big, and the price is cheap!  Service could be better though, they are low on waiter/waitress at rush hours.  Once my husband spill the green tea on the table, and it dripped all on me, and I screamed loudly because the tea was hot, the lady of the next table gave me 2 napkins, but the waitress just bought over a small wet cloth that soak up (very little since the cloth is already wet) the tea on the table, and didn't even give me more napkins (my pants was all wet) or wipe up the floor (it was very slippery when I was leaving they didn't soak up any tea that was on the floor).  And some of the waiter/waitress English level is very low, another table was asking for sea salt, and she didn't know what it was.  They might not be the best sushi in town, but at least the prices are the best for the quality you get."}
{"text":"I have been to this place so many times. The food alone is stellar! There is not one thing on that menu that I don't like. Sushi on bloor is not a place to go for ambiance...but for really good food. I would say this is probably the second most important sushi restaurant in Canada. The wait can be a HUGE pain but if you are a sushi fan it'll all be worth it in the long run."}
{"text":"Good and cheap for its price, the deluxe bento is the best value out there! Can get busy at times but it is worth going!"}
{"text":"I introduced my mother to sushi pizza a few years ago from this place and I felt as if I had just started something similar to the Crack epidemic. Since then I have been dragged to every sushi joint from here to ssauga and she came to the conclusion that every other place is just rolled up fecal matter in comparison. The prices are amazing for what you get. You wanna go on a cheap date but still impress the hell out of them with your knowledge on good food? Get them to order a salmon sushi pizza. You fat as hell and you wanna pretend you give a **** by eating healthy for a few days? You get the avocado salad. They are generous with those sweet green slices of reptile testicles (that's what the Aztec called them) and the portion is great. Best roll in my opinion is the Honour roll and the spicy salmon roll but not by far the best so experiment. They have a great lunch menu with good prices and a kick ass teriyaki chicken option. I made the mistake of introducing my picky as hell vegan girlfriend to this place and she is addicted and now I eat this crap for EVERY outing...and I STILL love it."}
{"text":"If you want to get stuffed under $10 this is the best sushi place I've been to so far.  Great for lunch time, night time I prefer better atmosphere but when it comes to fresh food, good portions and good price I haven't come across a better place yet.  The bento boxes are highly recommended."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

This is my go to place when I want some cheap sushi. Their location moved so they no longer have a 2nd floor. I find their new location is a lot more spacious than their old one. I came here for lunch today, their lunch specials are 6.99! Great deal! A must get when you come here is the grilled squid!

Sushi here isn't like super delicious but when you're hungry, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"worth the wait, worth the sometime crappy service (unless you get the guy). food is good and cheap."}
{"text":"You could not ask for better! This place boasts the best sushi in Toronto and they are 100% correct. I went here for lunch while on vacation (recommended by friends). This is the best sushi for the buck. The lunch sushi special provides green tea, miso soup, salad, and two rolls for a low $6.99. The fish is incredibly fresh and incredibly flavorful."}
{"text":"Beware of sneaky charges they're trying to add to your order on busy nights (Friday, Saturday, Sunday). For the TL;DR crowd: they tried to charge us a random $3 delivery charge despite being within the border limits of free delivery of orders $20 or more and paying for a $37.75 meal.

I was a regular customer until today. I've delivered to the same location on King Street between their delivery borders of Ossington and Yonge (Free for orders over $20) for the last 2.5 years. 
Tonight on a Friday, while we ordered they tried to charge us $3 for delivery for a $37.75 order.
 I ask them - why is this the case? 
\"Because you're south of King.\"
\"I'm on King, and on your website it shows that the border ends at Front which King is north of\"
\"Check the website,  we don't serve south of King.\"
\"I'm on the website, it shows the borders have not changed since I last ordered. Also I'm on King - not south.\" (I've attached photo of the borders of the delivery on their website).
No explanation. She just kept on repeating they don't serve south of King in a very rude and curt manor. I tried to explain I was actually on King not south of King and on the website - the borders showed otherwise. I canceled the order as a result out of frustration

The thing is on their website is they charge $5 for any orders outside of their borders. There was no such evidence of $3 delivery charge. 

Buyer Beware. After this incident - never will order again depsite being loyal for the last 2.5 years. You've lost a regular customer."}
{"text":"Whenever I pass there is always a queue out of the door. Food is great value for money and tasty, sushi was perfect. Bento boxes seemed very popular. Even the free soup was nice."}
{"text":"Wow... I'm impressed by the value here... especially considering this is downtown Toronto.  We ordered from the lunch specials... The maki rols were larger than I've seen else where and not just filled with tonnes of rice... the pieces of salmon were also larger than I've seen at other sushi places.  Each special was between $7-9.  I would definitely go here again.  If I live closer I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Great place for a sushi. I have been going there for many years. Good for take out for party or staying in. They have a great lunch special too. You must try salmon sushi pizza and salmon dragon. Good portions, good price and attentive service."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi at even more amazing prices- this is a restaurant I come back to time and time again.

This time, my boyfriend and I took advantage of their lunch special, each ordering a bento box (Chicken Katsu and Chicken Teriyaki respectively), as well as a sushi combo with the Dynamite Roll and Unagi (eel) Maki to share.

The bento box comes with Miso soup, a salad, tempura, and seasonal fruit. You really can't go wrong with a bento box. For the sushi, the avocado and seafood was fresh and the ratio to rice was quite decent, although I would really like to see more Unagi in my roll.

Our meal came up to less that $30, with tip. Bless the Sushi on Bloor gods for helping many a college student out!"}
{"text":"Just a few bites of our full review - 
\"Sushi Pizza with Salmon included sticky rice fried in a patty shape and topped with a few smoked salmon slices folded like a flower, and decorated with onion and sesame seeds.\"
\"Even though Sushi on Bloor is in a new location for not that long, it felt not well maintained.\""}
{"text":"The sushi was meh, tempura was okay, and sashimi was a little sketch to me (butterfish was sour, but the tuna and salmon were not bad, surf clam was rubbery!)

I'm still on a quest for cheap good sushi in Toronto!!

The best part was the free ice cream :P"}
{"text":"I love this spot! One of my favourite Sushi spots. Its extremely reasonably priced, and the portion size is amazing. Always comes with complimentary miso soup and green tea. The service is fast? and hassle-free. If you're looking for the friendliest service, this place may not be for you- but they are fast and efficient and always on the ball (which I prefer). I come here ofte?, and love it every time."}
{"text":"The most democratically priced place where great sushi are served :) 
Their seafood salad is the best in the city. We eat it all the time. Try mango rolls as well."}
{"text":"Gonna have to echo everyone else here...

Big portions, great prices, fast service. They even give you a discount for picking up take out if you wanna go home and gorge yourself \"sans pantalons\". Whatever blows your hair back I guess...

#1 in my books!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid- even when they got shut down for failing health standards a few years ago I STILL came back. I had literally the worst case of food poisoning imaginable after eating here last week and I'm still recovering. Sad to see that they have disappointed me after years of loyal patronage. Cheap shitty sushi is always a health gamble, but after almost dying I realized this place just isn't worth it anymore. If you have a career of any sort and can't afford days off- skip this place."}
{"text":"If you haven't figured out by reading the 140+ reviews, this place offers affordable sushi... especially popular amongst the university students who live near by.  Presentation is clean, simple food, no real surprises.

The draw backs, is that its pretty busy, so sometimes you may have to wait in line during lunch/dinner rushes for a table.  I just wish there were more adventurous items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good prices.  But like everyone says, go early as the place is very busy.  When you get there, make sure you walk past the line up to get your number or else you'll be waiting a long time."}
{"text":"Great price, decent sushi, excellent location (quite busy on the weekends around lunch time)."}
{"text":"Je suis allée dans ce restaurant un midi et la formule du midi est parfaite, pour 6,99$ je n'ai meme pas réussi à tout manger, et en plus on vous serre une soupe et un thé automatiquement quand vous arrivez!

Le restaurant est propre, calme, la musique est très sympa! Le service excellent, juste comme il faut!

Les plats sont très bon et variés puisque que pour le choix du déjeuner à 6,99$ il y a entre 10 et 14 choix donc pour tous les gouts!

A faire absolument!

Petit point négatif tout de même j'ai demandé un verre d'eau, qui avait le gout de produit vaisselle, pas cool!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite sushi spot in Toronto. After coming back from living abroad I was very disappointed. The portions that used to be generous have been downsized in fish and loaded with rice to replace it. I was so excited to be back to my favourite spot, but the change in food disappointed me to the point that I don't plan on coming back soon. Luckily there are many great options in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"I don't give out single stars lightly (note that before this, only 2% of my 469 reviews have been a single star), but I'd give Sushi on Bloor zero stars for their customer service if I could. 

I've ordered from them on several occasions -- not because their food is particularly good, but because of their close proximity to where I go to school at U of T. And I've forgiven the random spotty service because, hey, with a place like SoB my expectations are pretty low. However, tonight was the last straw. 

My colleague and I placed an order that was delivered over an hour and a half late, because the person answering the phone had written down the wrong phone number and couldn't contact us when they arrived. Not only was the snafu their mistake, but they also wouldn't offer even a small discount for the cold and congealed tempura and teriyaki they wanted us to take. No thanks. Bad customer service, rude and arrogant receptionist, and not even worth the fair-to-middling quality food they pump out. 

Sorry, Sushi on Bloor. Never again."}
{"text":"Yummy! The servings here are bigger than I expected for its price, and I really appreciate the free(!) scoop of ice cream afterwards. Definitely a stop worth going to if you're in the area with friends."}
{"text":"Their new location is a lot more spacious and welcoming than the last. Unlike the previous location, there isn't additional seating upstairs anymore.
Their prices (especially their lunch special) are the main reason why I frequent this place. The cheapest sushi I've found in Toronto that still tastes great. 
My only complain would be that the rice to filling ratio is higher than I'd prefer it to be."}
{"text":"We came here expecting decent sushi at great prices but unfortunately left disappointed. The value is extremely fair here and the service was good. No complaints whatsoever but we didn't find the sushi tasty and it was comparable to AYCE places (which is nothing special).

We ordered three rolls and a tempura appetizer ($6 for three shrimp and 7 vegetables is indeed a pretty good deal). There was a tad too much rice on the rolls and I didn't find the rice to be sweet enough. It just lacked the quality sushi taste. They were quiet liberal on the raw fish which is a plus.

We had good service, the waiters refilled our tea quite often and service was prompt, we sat down to salad and miso soup within minutes. We didn't feel like eating one of the rolls (after eating one roll) and was wondering if they could take it back and exclude it from the bill. There was no problem whatsoever, and we really appreciated that from them.

If you're looking for some cheap sushi/food, this place is great but just don't expect too much as we did."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Japanese restaurants but Sushi On Bloor is seriously the best place to get sushi. The fact that you have to wait to get seated is testimony to just how good this place is! The food is always consistent in its quality, the prices are fair and I always leave the restaurant feeling super full and with a bag full of leftovers. They even give you ice cream when you're done your main course!"}
{"text":"Sushi On Bloor has great tasting food (with good portions!) for very affordable prices. It is definitely a place to go to for the hungry, broke university student. There's also the fact that they have free ice cream! The only thing that I'm not too thrilled about is the fact that it takes quite a while to get seated. I once had to wait 20+ minutes to get a table - but then again, that says a lot about their food right?"}
{"text":"The freshness of the fish is incredible. The prices are so reasonable. Lunch with soup and salad and two rolls was $7.75. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Okay...overdue to update given the health scare (google it and you'll know)...but I'm not ready to write this place off. 

They've renovated the inside, put up new paint, lighting and bank seating. Cosmetic yes but still refreshing.

The food is still great. Fresh, fresh sushi, (the stuff moves out the door) so that's all that matters.  They throw in the miso soup, salad and red bean ice cream, so this place is still got the best value anywhere.

People will snub their noses at \"cheap\" sushi and the previous history of this place, but you can't argue with great fresh tasting sushi at a great price. I'll take the risk and let my taste buds decide."}
{"text":"If line ups are any gauge, this is the most popular sushi place on Earth.  It's partly because the sushi is good, and partly because the sushi is inexpensive.  There are two floors of seats, most of which are usually full, especially anytime around lunch, and after 6pm.  Try and get yourself in the section by the window on the 2nd floor.  Definitely the nicest part of the restaurant.

The menu is standard sushi fare, with a variety of maki, sashimi, bento boxes, etc.  Something I usually like to do is team up with a friend and either get 1 maki combo and and 1 sashimi combo, or perhaps 2 different maki combos and trade sushi."}
{"text":"I don't have much to say about this place except that it's cheap and it's good! I stumbled in here one night with a friend when we were craving sushi, and we weren't disappointed. We did have to wait a while for a table, but service was quick and polite.

I ordered the deluxe bento box for $8 and it was almost more than can I eat (which is saying something for me ;) ) I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a bite! Stumbled upon this place with my aunt for some lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. For such an affordable price it had great and tasty portions. My aunt got the lunch bento set whille i got a sashimi and sushi combo. Granted, the bento good but it was like a normal bento but the sashimi was very fresh! Definitely a go to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Great sushi for a great price.

Ordered just a few sushi dishes and they were all great and filling."}
{"text":"Just a note that this review is solely based on their Chicken Teriyaki Bento box as I am not a Sushi eater (sorry!). My sister bothered me all day yesterday to stop by this place for lunch today and since I did not want to hear about us not going I thought I would get it out of the way and go. After hearing about all the line ups to get into here I was fairly surprised that around 12:30pm on a Saturday there was none. We were seated by the door which was not the best as the gust of cold wind came through every time someone came in. This is a fairly small spot with limited seating which is why I assume they have line ups. They had lunch specials which seemed really great for only $7.75. My bento box cost the same. I can't say this place blew my mind as I have had better chicken teriyaki..however it was a fairly healthy portion of soup, salad, 5 pieces of veggies tempura (brocolli, 2 sweet potatos, eggplant, zuchini) and a healthy portion of white rice. Our server was okay, he just took our order and someone else delivered our food. there wasn't much interaction aside from that. My sister had the same but also ordered the dynamite rolls ($6 for 6 pieces) and she seemed to really enjoy it. 

I most likely won't be back as I can find better chicken teriyaki at other places but for the price and amount of food you get, this seems like a good go-to for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Love everything about Sushi On Bloor except for the long waits and line ups that extend outside the place on busy days. The service, price, and atmosphere are fairly good. The sushi? SPECTACULAR."}
{"text":"Sushi on Bloor was delicious!  Quick seating, great service, yummy foods!

That said, it had a few drawbacks.  I tried their Sashimi Silver plate (it's a plate full of slices of fish).  The slices were a little big (this could be a good thing!).  The sashimi was a little bit too cold, as if they kept their sushi bar at an abnormaly low temperature.  One slice tasted good on the outside, but it was a little frozen on the inside.  Eek!  I wish the slices of fish came with something like lemon slices, but maybe I'm being too picky.  Also, I requested no tuna, and some other fish to replace it.  Instead, they gave me the usual salmon, plus 3 more salmon.  This was probably because salmon is generally a cheaper fish (from my knowledge), but I was hoping for something else, like yellowtail, squid, or red snapper... mmm...

The green tea was very yummy, same with the ginger salad, and miso soup.

All in all, good place to eat something quick and easy.  I would not suggest the sashimi though."}
{"text":"Not much to be said here, a favorite with the locals in the area; Sushi on Bloor delivers great sushi at good prices and leaves you wanting more!

With the Annex area being filled with Thai and Japanese restaurants, it`s tough to decide on a good place to have sushi but Sushi on Bloor won`t dissapoint. Many nights there will be a long line up for tables so get there early or see if you can make a reservation before hand.

Atmosphere isn`t anything special but the service is good and the food is good so you can`t really complain. Definitely a good night out if you`re craving sushi!"}
{"text":"You want decent quality, cheap sushi and lots of it?  This is the place for you.  Most rolls were 5-6$, and they were huge.  You must try the mango roll, bbq'd eel + mango = delish.

I also had some sushimi, it was a little too warm for my liking, and the pieces were too big. I'm a big boy, and I had trouble sticking and entire piece into my mouth.  

This is a bang for your buck place. If you want sushi and you are nearby, then don't hesitate to come here."}
{"text":"The sushi was so so, not special. Affordable if you go with the lunch special, 8 rolls and 6 makis only for $6.99+taxes. You'll also get a soup and green salad for free as an appetizer. I just don't like how small the place is, very crowded during lunch time, it was also confusing because they had 2 places close to each other, the other one was bigger but it's closed."}
{"text":"I have yet to try a cheap sushi place as good as Sushi on Bloor. The prices are excellent and the quality of food is great. It has become my go-to lunch or dinner place when I want to eat sushi but don't want to break the bank. The only downside to this restaurant is the space. The space is a decent size but because it is always so busy you can often find yourself waiting around 10-15 minutes for a table. That being said, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"+1 for the cheapness .

quality of the food is whatever, but its not bad either . obviously its not going to be up to par w the fancier, pricer sushi places but its pretty much same as any AYCE sushi places around toronto . 

5.99 lunch combos ? with salad & miso soup included ? yes please ! whenever we're in the area, my bf & i usually go and order one appetizer & 3 combos and stuff ourselves silly . AND we get leftovers . for cheap sushi, it doesnt get much better .

OH ! for app, we always get this grilled fish .. a lot of times theyre out of it tho . i dont remember what the fish is called but it MELTS in your mouth . i actually like this more than the sushi =P"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for sushi in Toronto. I have been coming to Sushi on Bloor since 2008 and have been a steady, frequent customer since.

The lunch specials are a steal ($7.99) for 14 pieces of sushi. The fish is fresh and portions are large. Every meal comes with miso soup and Japanese salad with excellent dressing.

I would highly recommend Sushi on Bloor to those who like sushi and do not like paying exorbitant prices. This often results in long queues at peak hour, but it is worth the wait. I have yet to be disapointed by Sushi on Bloor."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week and was promptly seated. We were waiting for a friend who was running late, but ordered on her behalf. We told the servers and they were so attentive! They waited until she arrived to serve her miso soup and tea. We were very impressed with how attentive they were because each time we finished our last sip of tea...there they were with a refill (this is very important to me because we're trying to stay hydrated in 2018).

I ordered the Honour Roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll with a brown rice substitution. I actually really liked that they had this option because it's very rare and I prefer brown rice anyway. They also didn't skimp out on the ingredients (like most places do), especially for this price point. Would definitely go again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place always has great food.  I've never been disappointed by the quality, quantity, or price.  It's my go-to sushi stop in Toronto!  The pieces of sashimi are thick and as fresh as you'll find in Toronto.

The only thing to keep in mind is that if you're hungry, or tight on time, make a reservation.  Most nights of the week from 6pm-8pm there is a line-up at the door ranging from a few minutes to upwards of 30 minutes.  It's well worth the wait even if you didn't call ahead.  It has a line-up for a reason - it's that good!

They also offer take-out if you're looking to beat the line."}
{"text":"This is the place you come to when you are on a budget and need a sushi fix. It's honestly a bang for your buck! 

We ordered the red dragon, rainbow, black dragon, spicy salmon, salmon ginger wasabi roll and one assorted tempura. (We also got complimentary enoki beef rolls because they messed up an order!) Oh, and I can't forget the complimentary miso soup and ice cream. 

All of this came up to a sweet $58 and some. 

Obviously the quality can't be compared to Guu down the street.. But still quality sushi regardless. The rolls could be a little more creative, but it's not a big deal. The ingredients still mingled. Presentation wise.. Well honestly when you pay for fast service and cheap quality food.. Who cares!  Avocado was bang on (total pet peeve when they're not fresh or browning), portions were reasonable and sashimi was fresh. 

Service is always fast at this place. The only thing I dislike about Sushi on Bloor is the \"waiting area\" in the front. It often gets busy and results in a 10-15min wait for a table. People often line up in this tiny corridor between the inside/outside doors.. It gets way too congested and makes me feel super impatient with all the people brushing past me. Stop shoving me!! I'm hungry and cranky too! 

Well despite the cranky and hungry sushi lovers...

My sushi craving has been satisfied tonight!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi spot in Toronto. Good quality, good price, good portions. I eat here about once a week.

SUSHI
The fish always tastes fresh, and they have a good range and quality of styles and selections. The rice is always soft and perfect. Sometimes sushi restaurants add some sort of sushi vinegar to their rice that gives it a strong twangy taste, but Sushi on Bloor's rice tastes fresh and pure.

APPETIZERS
I usually always get the tempura appetizer, it's usually done well (excluding a few times when the pumpkin was a little grainy or the oil needed to be changed).

SEATING/ENVIRONMENT
I usually have to wait a little bit to get a seat on average, but the wait staff are very eager to seat you. If there is a long line out the door than they may be doing a ticket system, so make sure they know you're there.
Takeout is a very easy alternative when you don't feel like waiting.
Sitting in offers a clean and lively environment. They serve you tasty miso soup and hot Genmaicha (brown rice tea) as soon as they can, the quality is surprisingly good.

SERVICE
They can be very busy, so I don't mind waiting sometimes. I've never felt they were annoyed with me like some authentic Asian places can be, they're normally either neutral to friendly. Don't be afraid to ask for something you need.


Try the black dragon roll :)"}
{"text":"Late in the first season of the L Word, before it spiraled into indiscriminate lady-humping and Jenny was still somewhat redeemable, there is a scene where Candace, the sexy harlot contractor, is demonstrating to Bette, the impossibly-desirable, wrestling-with-monogamy museum director, the realistic triangle of workmanship: fast, cheap, and good.  You can always have two, she explains lustily, but never all three.

Sushi-loving Candace clearly never came here.

The sheer volume of food you get with any $5 order is borderline obscene.  For around $30, a table of four could share any number of fat, bulbous, overstuffed maki of the gods: spicy crunchy tuna too big to fit in your mouth; yellowtail handrolls that squirt fish out of the bottom when you bite into it; sweet potato tempura making love to creamy avocado; inside-out wasabi salmon maki that is JUST THICK CUTS OF EFFING SALMON, ROLLED AROUND GINGER.  Oh, and to start?  Insanely delicious char-grilled squid, bbq beef maki wrapped around green onion, and an avocado salad that will break your heart.

Also, they plop down miso soup when you sit down like other, lesser restaurants do water.

O, Sushi on Bloor.  Resting place of my heart.  I don't have an iphone nor do I even live in Toronto anymore, yet I still believe myself mayor."}
{"text":"My quest for good sushi is still on.  i was brought here by some locals so of course I had to take the opportunity to taste what all the buzz was about.

Hmmmm....me thinks Toronto has very few options.  One of the things I miss about Van is it's OK sushi is phenomenal here.  I tried so much stuff I do not even know where to begin.   

The infamous California roll made famous by Tojo's in Van is a shadow of itself here.  Ever had a crunchy California roll? I swear it was a cucumber not an avocado and definitely not fresh crab.  The  chicken teriyaki was overcooked. I had to tear off the hard pieces from my mouth quite a few times.  The tempura and iceberg lettuce salad with the universal Japanese vinaigrette was exactly as it should be.

I did have a wonderful dish that makes me want to eat it again. The salmon pizza.  Wow! It melted in my mouth like butter. The crunch of the patty base of deep fried rice with a layer of mayo was a wonderful texture against the salmon.  I am so hungry now.

Other points in it's favour was the cleanliness of the place.  Love it!  

The friendly personality of the owner makes for a warm space despite its modern design."}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty hard to beat. I love their food and not to mention that they do have great service. The maki rolls, the tempura vegetables...Like there wasn't anything to complain about, just compliment, and I would highly recommend checking this place out, I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Try it out!"}
{"text":"First of all the sushi quality was terrible. I had the Sushi Bronze combo and liked none of the pieces. But worse than that was the customer service. We got there a bit pass 10:30pm and we quickly ordered as we were reminded that the last call was at 11pm. But even though we made our order in a timely manner we were interrupted by the servers several times. First they brought the bill before we ask for it, and then the machine for us to pay while we were still eating. They also refused to split the appetizer's cost that we got for the table. And then after we made the payment while there was still 10 minutes left until the closing time the servers kept staring at us making us uncomfortable and we had to leave the place."}
{"text":"I found Sushi on Bloor to be a solid lunch-time choice for sushi and Japanese food.  I ended up ordering the beef teriyaki, which came in a neatly organized bento box with rice and veggie tempura.  

Very delicious and freshly prepared.  Great portion size as well!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"You guys...Sushi on Bloor really is good. Yes, still. 

Although the wait can be long, yes, and it can be loud, but honestly...the food is fresh and generous and the prices are reasonable. The wakame salad is hands-down my fave in the city, and one time I saw Ryan Gosling there. 

I'll remain forever a  firm loyalist in the ongoing debate of SOB vs. New Gen, and everyone knows you must only choose ONE."}
{"text":"I have been here for both lunch and dinner a few times and have always been pleased with the food. It's always busy and at peak hours you might actually wait a few mins for a table. As soon as your seated however, miso and green tea arrive to great you. The menu is quite typical and priced moderately to slightly higher than other joints on the block. 

The salad is delicious, that dressing tho :P so tasty. If you dig fatty green fruits, the avocado salad is easily worth the $5.50. It's a meal sized portion accompanied by a small bowl of their house dressing. *They have lunch specials starting at $6.99

The fish is always very fresh. The Salmon is buttery in its raw state and tenderly flavorful in its teriyaki form. 

One thing to note however, is this restaurant seems to emphasize rice in their meals. Their white rice is billowy and wonderful but I prefer my maki with a higher filing to rice ratio. As well, their Bento box has a huge 2 cup serving of that carby goodness, but personally I'd go for half the rice, and maybe get some cooked/stirfried veg in there.

Overall, if I'm looking to sample some appetizers and have a couple extra bucks to spend I'll come for the good quality food served up by this popular sushi joint."}
{"text":"Things I loved:
1. They brought you soup before you even ordered (which means if I only ordered a roll I'd still get soup)
2. Bento Box came with melon and orange slice :) (obsessed with fruit & ended up ordering a bento anyways)
3. They brought the rolls out before the rest of the bento.. and the salmon roll didn't have a massive chunk of salmon.. I like the fish cut thin.
4. They allowed me to substitute veggie tempura for steamed! (no fried food for this belly)
5. Ice Cream after!
6. Chicken Bento only $8!! And super fast :)"}
{"text":"i love this downtown restaurant.  parking can be a nightmare.  you do have to wait for a table.  the staff are amazing.  if you become a regular and you sit at the very front where the chefs make the sushi, the chefs sometimes throw in a free plate of food for you, especially when you are dating and you have your lady friend there with you right at the front.  it's what happened to me when i was dating my girl friend who is now my wife.  the food is perfect and the waiting staff are very friendly.  i never had a bad experience with sushi on bloor.  i would love to go back there.  i have now moved to scarberia and i dread the thought of coming downtown now.  

just take your date to this place, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Overrated and overhyped. 

Walking past this store, I normally see a long line of people waiting to be seated so I always assumed that the sushi here must be beyond stellar. I came here once for lunch and got the lunch special which ended up being the Dynamite Roll and Salmon Maki with Soup and Salad on the end. The miso soup tasted very standard and the salad was quite delightful. However, the Maki rolls were disgusting. There was zero flavour and it was extremely chewy and hard. I felt very uncomfortable eating the Maki rolls. The Dynamite Rolls weren't too bad, but they were also very plain. Dipping the rolls in soy sauce didn't make much of a difference. Definitely will not be coming back in the future and will save my money for better sushi."}
{"text":"Good price. Good value. Sushi is average. Service is trash though but go for the price and value."}
{"text":"This restaurant was in many ways mediocre to me. Perhaps it is because I came in a half hour before closing, but the food simply was not \"great\" in my opinion. There was so much rice used in each roll that it was almost difficult to chew, and in general, I was disappointed with the quality that I've seen so many people rave about. The salmon tasted a little bit more fresh than other restaurants, however not that much so. I think this store is reasonably priced, and I'm sure they can do much better, but personally I did not care for it."}
{"text":"I'm sure that most of the reviews say the same thing as what I'm about to say here, but here goes. Sushi on Bloor is the place to go if you're craving sushi and basic Japanese fare at a totally reasonable price. You're not going to get fancy rolls that will blow you away with it's presentation, or service that makes you want to tip that little extra. But rather, you will get consistently fresh sushi, fast service, a guaranteed line up to get in and most importantly cheap prices. 
We love coming here because sushi is my comfort food and I don't feel like dishing out $100 on a weeknight dinner. If you haven't been, go and stuff yourself and I'm sure you will have a great time. Try getting a seat downstairs as I find it's more lively and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times a year with family and friends. I always say the same every time, the food is decent, the prices are competitive and the service isn't as great or consistent. 

Today, I came in and ordered quite a few different dishes. When my salmon sushi came out I noticed the salmon was a very thin cut placed on top of rice. While i order Salmon sushi often at other restaurants, this salmon was so thin that it at times it looked transparent - I could see the rice under it at certain spots. I'm not one to complain, I still ate all my food - which the rest wasn't bad at all.

Still chewing on my last bite, I told myself I'd get desert, so before I even had the chance to look up and ask for the dessert options, the server, an older lady with short hair, came over and left my receipt on the table. Just like that I paid the bill and sipped my tea."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Sushi on Bloor?

It's cheap, the portions are huge and the food is delicious. I love bringing out of towners here, Europeans in particular because they just can't get over how much sushi you get for the dollar. Let's not forget the miso soup and green tea that comes out within minutes of sitting down, there's also the free desert before you go. Hello mango ice cream!

Two small things to note about this place 1 - the queues and 2 - the table turnover. 1 - Considering there are about eight sushi places between Bathurst and Spadina on Bloor and this place is always packed with a queue out the door you know it's a good sign. If you don't get in before the lunch or dinner rush be prepared to wait. 2 - Again going back to the never ending queues, this is not the place to dilly-dally. Post lunch or dinner take your chat a few doors down for Yogurty's (- yum!) or expect to get some real cut eye from the servers and those who've been queued up forevs."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place downtown. The bento boxes are very filling for the price and the staff are so friendly and patient! This place is always full because of how great the food is so make a reservation or come after 8pm when the crowd thins out. The Dragon rolls are my go-to - my partner and I order two dragon roll dishes so we don't have to share!"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi spot in Toronto. Consistently amazing quality and the portions are great too."}
{"text":"TL:DR If you want a sushi place that's a bang for your buck and that will literally fill you up definitely come here 

I stumbled upon this gem when I was living in the area and I deadass ate here 3 times in one week. I've brought my friends and family here, this is pretty much the only sushi place I go to in Toronto now 

Portion size
- H U G E
- honestly, the rolls are the biggest I've seen in a while and when I order they never overpack it with rice 
- the udon portion is huge (i usually get the tempura udon and for like 10$ roughly you get a huge bowl of udon and 2 of every tempura....theres like 10 pieces in total)
- bento boxes are huge
- like why are you still reading this just go tbh 

service
- they come to refill your tea without even asking and the waitresses are Q U I C K 
- they always offer you free ice cream in the end which is just really cute 

Its pretty busy so be ready to wait for a little during dinner rush especially. (Not a long wait the max I've waited was probably like 10 mins)"}
{"text":"(Repeating this review as I posted on the old business page)

Just came back home from a horrible experience at Sushi on Bloor. The waitress who took our order was completely rude when I told her about my allergies and basically told me that I should eat somewhere else after I was inquiring about what was in the tempura flour! Having allergies is pretty annoying and inconvenient to deal with enough as it is, but having someone who is rude and does not even attempt to be accommodating makes it all the more frustrating. 
Sushi was average, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has an allergy. Go somewhere where people who have allergies are treated with respect and consideration."}

{"text":"I am biased. I love it here. Inexpensive. Friendly. Always come here for my Supreme Bento Box fix."}
{"text":"Good portion! Loved the spicy honour roll and salad. Good service.

For only 6.99$, their lunch specials are pretty filling. I got the maki sushi and spicy honour roll that come with miso soup and salad. Not a big fan of their makis (I'm pretty picky when it comes to rice and seaweed texture), but the spicy honour roll and salad was pretty flavourful. 

Casual atmosphere and clean interior. Barely audible top hits radio station. 15-20 people during lunch. Awesome service.

Would come again!"}
{"text":"It was good. But I wasn't that impressed compared with other sushi places."}
{"text":"This place is great. Service is fast (once seated), pricing is just right, and the sashimi slices are bigger than most restaurants - plus deeelicious!

I just moved to TO a few months ago but have gone 3 times already. Like what most reviews have said, it's busy - I've gone on fridays and a wednesday and they were packed on both evenings. Its worth the wait tho!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer at Sushi on Bloor.  I usually come here for their chicken bento box dinner or lunch specials.  Their prices have increased over time. 

I got the lunch special (dynamite roll and salmon maki). Their sushi pieces are HUGE - much larger compared to other places.  The salmon maki tastes fresh and the shrimp tempura in the dynamite roll tastes a bit hard). 

I decided to try out the chicken katsu udon lunch special today. It tasted alright. Too bad the udon has no vegetables in it. However, they give a good portion of katsu. 

FYI: there's usually a line up for dinner, so come early or come at a non busy time! They also give ice cream on the house for dinner."}
{"text":"The photo does not do the restaurant justice but hands-down my favourite sushi spot!!! Portions are huge and price is great -- about $5-7 per roll. There have a lunch special which I just learned about today 2 rolls, miso soup and a salad for $8.50!! I've been here multiple times within last year and it never disappoints. *Usually a lineup during peak times so be ready to wait but so worth it!"}
{"text":"The best of all the \"cheap\" sushi options available on the Annex, and possibly within a 1-km radius around that neighbourhood. It's also very busy, even on Tuesday evenings. If you're lucky (or you request) you can get seated in one of the comfier, spacier booths upstairs.

Service is quick. The waiters are all on top of the game, always coming by to take orders or give extra tea. One \"niceness\" is their tendency to bring over a steaming miso soup as soon as you sit down. This may feel welcoming on a winter day, but could be interpreted as a ploy to make you stay and hurry up with your order.

Menu has a great variety of options, all at reasonable prices. Rolls start from $5 (and they're YUMMY!) while bento's go from $10 or so. The bento deal does not come as \"cheaply\" as New Generation - you add an extra dollar or so to switch to salmon or beef, while New Generation charges equally for chicken, salmon, and beef. Guaranteed, though, Sushi on Bloor delivers better quality food all around - you can taste the plump deliciousness behind the Japanese-style rice, the crunchiness of the caviar, and the extra succulent flavour behind their tempura batter.

Weekdays lunch special give you the best bang for your buck - for $6.99 you can get curry rice with salad and soup. Just order right before 5PM and you've already got a filling early dinner in.

*Best deals*
Lunch special Unagi (eel) rice for $7.99 -  I pay up to $13.95 for an eel rice at other restaurants and recieved cold (or lukewarm) and stale-ish meat, but Sushi on Bloor's eel is still hot from the grill, slightly crunchy and nicely flakey on the inside. Served alongside pickled vegetables and a delicious, well-balanced sauce.
Crunchy roll - $5.95 - a good, cheaper alternative to dynamite roll and just as filling. The tempura batter is crunchy without feeling stale or unevenly fried, which is how it's been at other places. 

*Generally*
Good variety of raw meat, and the salmon is especially well-prepared and marinated.
Filling and excellent deals on rolls.

Definitely recommended if you are looking for good, cheap sushi. Obviously, there is a difference between this restaurant and other higher-end sushi places. I don't think this restaurant is Japanese-owned, and their flavours lean more towards what you'd expect from a Chinese chef than a Japanese one. BUT, compared with other sushi eateries of a similar price and calibre, Sushi on Bloor is VERY GOOD (and the only that is worth the money). Go here, not its rivals."}
{"text":"Sushi on Bloor is, hands down, the best place for sushi.

Food: Large portions. Fresh sushi. For dinners, there's complimentary soup and ice cream (green tea ftw).
Service: Efficient. 
Ambiance: Energetic. 
Price: Affordable. As in, student-budget affordable. You definitely get a bang for your buck.
Location: Near a subway--good enough for me.
Wait time: About 10 minutes. Not too bad.

I noticed a lot of negative reviews about the service and just a kind reminder that this is not one of those establishments where you celebrate your anniversary. It's a casual sushi bar. The spacing is a bit tight, but not a huge deal. I had the sushi platinum combo, and I absolutely recommend it. The sashimi combos look amazing too, if you're into that."}
{"text":"We went to Sushi on Bloor for lunch on a sunny Sunday afternoon. The place was packed (as usual) but we got lucky and were seated right away. 

They have the BEST lunch specials (12-4pm Mon-Thurs, 12-3pm Fri-Sun) - so cheap!! Did I mention it was cheap? $7 specials for 12 rolls (2 different types). Our eyes were bigger than our stomach as we ended up ordering way too much for just the two of us but that's what leftovers are for.

We shared:
- Miso soup and small salad (you get these to start) - nice way to start the meal
- Lunch special S1 ($7) - 6 pieces of avocado roll and 6 pieces of dynamite roll.
- Lunch special S7 ($8) - 6 pieces of spicy honour roll and 6 pieces of unagi roll. I think the unagi was the best out of the lot that we ordered.
- Ikayaki ($5.50) - delicious, perfectly cooked grilled octopus appetizer.
- Sweet potato tempura and avocado VR1 ($4.75) - you get 8 pieces. This one was just average, probably wouldn't order it again.

Service was fast and our server was busy but super nice. It was my second time coming to this place - I was craving sushi the whole time I was in Toronto and this hit the spot! Good quality sushi for the price and busy so you know turnover is constant."}
{"text":"Wallet friendly and good quality 
The service is ok but you may have to wait for a table since this place is popular in Annex"}
{"text":"Sushi on Bloor has two things going for them, price and quantity, both excellent. I would go to SOB again and again for this reason. The only draw back is the wait is long and delivery times can be a bit dicey, which speaks more to there popularity in the Annex area. Overall, the service is do-able, and I would definitely recommend this to someone who likes sushi but isn't a snob."}
{"text":"Service: Fast, friendly and efficient. 

Food: Subpar. This is an a la carte sushi restaurant with worse food then an all you can eat. The sashimi was alright, the cuts of fish were way too big instead of it being thinly sliced. The tuna has been previously frozen and you can taste it. The rainbow roll was good but nothing spectacular. Great presentation on the dishes though. 

Overall, I wouldn't repeat this place. I'd rather pay the same for a better quality all you can eat or a pay a little extra for quality sushi."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure what the hype of this place is.
There's more authentic and delicious sushi in Toronto.
The only attraction of this place for me is that it's cheap and I get a scoop of mango ice cream after.

Anyway, drop in if you're in the area. If not, there's no need to."}
{"text":"Alright. About 80% of the people in Toronto have at least heard of, if not already eaten at this restaurant. I have been coming here since before they won Best Sushi in the City in Now Magazine all those years ago.

To sum it up, yes, I will admit that the quality and presentation is not the same today as when they were brand new and became a hip place. But that being said, the food is still fresh, and where else can you get these amazing Bento Box combo's for THESE PRICES?! NOWHERE!

I always get the Supreme Bento Box - Medium Rare Beef. Trust me, it's good quality meat such a price, and it comes with some sushi and Shrimp Tempura! FOR $10.50!

What can I say? It's good value for what you pay, and I'm sure a lot of people will agree with that."}
{"text":"Sushi is very ordinary and the service is BAD!!! Would not recommend since there are many good choices on that street!!"}
{"text":"I came here in December 31 2014 with my bro the price may be cheap but the sushi was terrible. First off they put way to much rice on their sushi that it's looks like a giant rice ball. The tempura wasn't bad but we ordered this one dish I believe it was a cooked fish sushi which had a very disgusting smell to it we told the owner to please refund and he was nice enough to do it. Problem the volume of peopel are perused by how cheap the sushi is but their quality is absolutely horrible.  If they improved their quality if fish and learned how to make sushi properly maybe I might come back for now I'm not coming back here"}
{"text":"Mediocre sushi, large rolls, lots of rice and little fish and their rolls tasted about the same. Price is very good. All in all it's an ok place for sushi."}
{"text":"Long wait time but really worth the wait. Went with a group of friends at 7pm on a weekday and we waited for about 30-45 mins to be seated. Prices are super low and the food is so yum. The tempura don was really filling so I ended up saving half of it for the next meal."}
{"text":"The very best sushi place downtown in terms of price:quality ratio. Free miso soup and salad, always. Proportions and quality of sushi top notch. They had to raise their prices this past year, but that's going on all over the place. Wait times in the evenings are usually pretty long especially Fridays and Saturdays, so go early! Kind of a hustle and bustle place; not really somewhere where you can sit down and chat. But the food is excellent, and that should be the main reason why you go to a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tasty Food - Fast Service! 

Usually very busy and has a wait so their service is very fast. 
I ordered the veggie bento box and some of the veggie rolls. 

Was very satisfied with the food - very fresh and affordable for the amount that we got! 

Would recommend for a quick dinner option on a weeknight"}
{"text":"If I have a sushi craving and I'm passing through the Annex, Sushi on Bloor is my go to place. The new location is nice and modern and a little more spacious however it feels like the seating has decreased since they no longer have their second floor which is too bad. The place is still packed during dinner time. It will benefit you to make reservations. I made sure to make a reservation for 2 people at 7pm - surprisingly I heard the wait for other tables for 2 were about 30-40 mins! We got seated 10 mins after we arrived, better than waiting longer for sure. It was by the door so it was quite high traffic and hectic. I also felt uncomfortable eating with people standing right beside our table. Aside from that, sushi flavour is okay, I usually get spicy crunch roll, gyoza, seaweed salad and grilled squid. Value of the food and prices are great. I like that you automatically get miso soup before you eat and ice cream after. It's a nice touch! The food also came out quick and the servers were good checking in on us. I'll be back again. I gave this a 4/5 because the overall experience here was great. If you want authentic Japanese sushi then you should probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Price has gone up since my original review used to be $5.75 on their special by $1, still a good deal and they end their specials at 3 PM. Try the Salmon Sushi PIzza, very interesting and good.
."}
{"text":"Loved!
Best sushi in Anex Best prices! 
Not very good service, but the best quality!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  I've been frequenting this place since 2009 and other sushi places just don't compare.  Great portions for next to nothing and so yummy.  Everything is extremely fresh and very well presented.  They get pretty busy, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi places in the city. Their california rolls are really good."}
{"text":"If you aren't interested in all you can eat sushi, and want to pay a reasonable price... then this place is for you. I would recommend the tempura, and honour roll.

One time at lunch, I ordered two lunch specials because I need at least three rolls to feel full (and the lunch special came with two). And if I do all you can eat sushi I am sure I eat more than four rolls worth..... and the waitress asked me, \"are you sure?\" I wasssss and I did not regret it."}
{"text":"I live 10 minutes away from this restaurant. I have been enjoying this place for years.. I mean years! It's cheap and delicious! I like the variety of the choices they offer. The lunch special is unbelievably cheap! Cheap is a good word here :D I often go with my husband and order dinner for two and I recommend this combo to any couple or even company of three people. Heads up! It's a lot of food.."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi, but they recently moved and got rid of the upstairs floor. With half the seats now the wait times are quite a bit longer."}
{"text":"Great prices for sushi, I was very impressed! The amount of food I could get for what would cost me ridiculous amounts at another restaurant is crazy. It is also pretty good sushi. Not the best but above average. They also have very fast service. I recommend the sunshine roll, it was the best I had there. They also have very good gyoza and tempura."}
{"text":"Decent sushi for a descent price.
Minuses: Some of the waiters seem to have not too much interest in serving. And some tables are too packed together so you lack any kind of privacy - that's an understatement."}
{"text":"I read in my subway paper that this place has cucarachas! EW!!"}
{"text":"My favourite cheap sushi place! The rolls are great (I always get the honour roll) and large for the price. You even get free hot tea and miso soup! The fish is very fresh too. My only complaint is that the service is iffy and it gets packed VERY fast. Definitely avoid this place on weekends at lunch or dinner time."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto, good food, great service, and awesome prices! You cannot go bad with them! Most of the time you need to wait a fee minutes to get a table but you can call in advance for reservations"}
{"text":"This place is for people who give up quality for price & quantity.

You can't argue the value they propose, price is cheap and the portions are huge. Their rolls tend to be bigger than average and cheaper. Tempura is great, teriyaki is okay, everything else is okay, everything cooked is okay. nothing impressive.

However, fish is very low quality, I would not get sashimi from here.
And they have this bleach smell, i think it's from the mop they use to clean the floors. They could've used something with better scent?

Yet still, it's quick, fast, cheap, if you just want to get rolls without paying too much, this is the place.

Just stay way from raw stuff."}
{"text":"I don't get the line-ups. It's consistently mediocre service and food quality.  It's probably B-OK, for its price point and location. I've definitely had better sushi."}
{"text":"keep on walking... it was good at one time; not good anymore. if you want cheap sushi, there are better offerings east and west on bloor street. and let's be frank, there's only so cheap you want to go with raw fish, even if you a starving student."}
{"text":"This is my go- to when I don't know where else to go downtown but be prepared to line up a little for dinner. Lunchtime is usually better and they also have lunch specials. Can't beat a $7 lunch downtown. 

Their sushi and sashimi are usually good and their avocado salad is very good value for the money. 

For a couple of 2-4 people, I recommend getting their dinner for two so you get a combination of everything and is usually more than enough for 2. They are not the best sushi I've had but definitely good value for the money and overall the quality of their fish is not bad. 

Service is also quite fast!"}
{"text":"got the special bento box and WOW what a deal man!!!! 
the portions are so generous and the quality of the teriyaki chicken and tempura was so great. 

seriously such a great deal. and only for like $10.

it was a great surprise. 

definitely coming back and becoming a regular"}
{"text":"Line ups are expected but worth the wait.

Food is always good -Always!

I have never had an experience of the Sashimi being off."}
{"text":"Bons sushis à un prix donné. Soupe miso super bonne. Vraiment une bonne adresse. Propre, service rapide. Beaucoup de choix de sushis. Un peu de mayo dans les rolls mais correct."}
{"text":"If you want fresh sushi for cheap this is the place to go in Toronto!  Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. The waiters don't look or sound friendly at all. During the meal, it took us at least 5mins trying to get the waiter's attention, and another 5+mins for them to bring us water. I ordered the chicken katsu lunch special. The chicken was hard and over fried, but I loved the special salad dressing and the tempura. I won't dine here again for sure."}
{"text":"I love coming to Sushi on Bloor because of the location! It is downtown and near my campus (UofT St. George). I only come here for one reason: seafood salad! It is so good, it is a huge salad - and not your typical lettuce they use mix greens! And on top of this salad you get cherry tomatoes, carrots, seaweed and sashimi! The price of this salad is really reasonable too I think it's about $6-7 and for take out they -10%. What is so amazing about this salad is their unique salad dressing. You just cannot get enough of it!

For other items at this restaurant my friends and family enjoy ordering their rolls too. So this place is really good for their pricing and quality too. 

I definitely recommend this place for people who need a quick fix. 

- CL"}
{"text":"This place is authentic. Mama likey. Got the chirashi ... was fresh and yum and tasted good except for the imitation crab. Cmon chef! Chicken karaage was crisp and hot and came with a sweet sauce. All entrees come with a salty miso soup, salad and ice team. Sweet! Would go back. Very popular with the locals which always is a good sign."}
{"text":"When i lived in the city i would crush this place once a week with my wife. Spicy Tuna is off the charts.. Fresh fish, the crowds are huge but the price is right. 

Everytime i leave the place i feel full and satisfied like."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area, and are looking to get my sushi fix (but don't want to pay outrageous AYCE prices) I opt for Sushi On Bloor. I agree with past reviews, people don't come here for quality, but rather quantity.

I usually come for the lunch specials on Saturdays. I believe it's the same lunch menu during the week but I wouldn't be able to tell you for sure. My boyfriend and I usually share 3 lunch combos and always leave with a take-out container, thinking \"why did we order so much food?\" 
With prices like that you have to.

There was one time we came at around 1:00PM for lunch on a Saturday and the place had a 20 minute waitlist. Arrive early!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times. I never found anything special with with Sushi on Bloor. The food is ok, the wait time to get a seat is ridiculous. And the service really sucks, it took the servers a while to get our orders. 

If you've eaten at one sushi restaurant at the Annex, you've been to all of them.... that just my opinion.

After seeing that link about the restaurant being shut down, I doubt I'll be going back there."}
{"text":"New location but everything else exactly the same!

This has been my go-to sushi place for 8 years. The lunch special is what draws the crowd, at $6.99 it is a serious bargain. The sushi isn't the highest quality, but the portions are HUGE and for the price, you are going to love this place if you are a cheap-eats kind of person.

The new location is a bit more spacious and nicer tables. They have brought the exact same sushi bar over from down the road. Same staff as always. Service is usually quick, the servers are fast and efficient but not always focused on friendliness (not unfriendly, just working to get things done quickly)

The sushi on bloor MANGO ROLL will always have a special place in my heart (unagi/eel with mango roll)"}
{"text":"I really love this place. 

YES you will likely have to wait for a table (line up moves quick though) and the service is mediocre. 

But really you don't go here for the service/atmosphere, I go for the CHEAP big portions of good sushi! 

The $5.99 lunch special is an absolute bargain. 

I really like their mango roll...it's mango, unagi and tempura bits. YUM! Or if I'm feeling health conscious, I'll order a seafood salad (giant green salad with salmon sashimi, shrimp and other seafood goodies on top for $6). The ikayaki is nice too."}
{"text":"Our first dining experience in Toronto was an incredible one.  We scoured Yelp for a good sushi restaurant and found a star.

I lived in San Francisco for quite a while and acquired my love of sushi while there.  Some say it's the best sushi outside of Japan, though New York City likes to take claim to that as well.  I say it's a draw :-)

Here though, in Toronto, if you want FANTASTIC sushi with friendly, albeit not super attentive, service, this is your place.

As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and seated and no more than a few moments after sitting down, we were enjoying miso soup and hot tea.  Really good miso soup.

We ordered our sushi, I got the number 84, a sushi combo with a spicy tuna roll, a unagi roll and a shrimp tempura roll.  It also came with a classic ginger dressing salad, my favorite.  All of this was $14!  That's the cost of a single roll at many sushi restaurants, much less THREE full rolls!

My b/f ordered some vegetarian rolls ($4.50 each!!!) and an appetizer of vegetable tempura.

When we got the tempura, we realized we were in over our heads.  Each vegetable came to us in four or more slices.  Eggplant, sweet potato, zucchini, broccoli and carrot.  It's a meal for two, an appetizer for four.  

We got our rolls and realized the same.  This meal could easily have fed four adults.  The quality of the food was fantastic, the service was pretty great and the value is out of this world.  We spent $26 and got probably $60+ worth of sushi.  You could easily dine here for under $15, maybe even $10.

This place had us leaving satisfied and tempted to move here, if not JUST for Sushi on Bloor!

But wait, there's more.  After you finish eating your sushi, which we couldn't, here was just so much, they give you free ice cream.  Come on, free ice cream?  Amazing.

Sushi on Bloor just might be heaven on Earth."}
{"text":"Sushi on Bloor provides decent food at affordable prices. To be fair, I don't order the sushi when I come here; I usually opt for a bento box so I can't say much about the quality of the sushi. As for the teriyaki boxed meals, I usually get the salmon and it's delicious. Usually I'm a bit weary about ordering salmon as the texture can come out weird if not cooked right but I've never had a problem here. They also provide the option of brown rice for a dollar more for those with white carb phobia. Seating here is a bit cramped however, but it's a casual quick dine in type of place. Not bad for the price, portion and location."}
{"text":"Middle top range sushi, great prices.  Prefer to get take-out as the seating space is crazily over-crowded and squished together and there is usually a long line-up out the door with people waiting to sit.  Also, you get a 10% discount if you get take-out.

Love the sushi, love the rolls, especially \"Casa Loma\" and the bento box deal is fantastic, especially with salmon - there is enough food for two people."}
{"text":"The price is amazing and the free ice cream is a nice touch, but the rolls are too large and the sushi doesn't taste that great to me.  If you're looking to eat on a tight budget, this is the place to go but if you're seeking great taste, and don't wish to wait a long time to sit down, then I suggest going elsewhere."}
{"text":"This sushi place was so loud and crowded. They took a while to come to our table to get orders, but the sushi was good quality. There were lots of people who came for pick up on a Friday night.

Miso Soup and green tea was included and also Ice cream is free if your order meets the minimum requirement.
I recommend the Rainbow roll and Spicy Salmon roll.
They have large Saporo beers, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very reasonable priced for the quality it serves. They offer complimentary miso soup, unlimited green tea and ice creams of choice. Although everything was delicious, the special rolls were more tasty than sushi gold set menu. 
All in all a must go and i added it to my favs"}
{"text":"I have been going to Sushi on Bloor for over 10 years so this review is tried and tested! Thought I would write a review since they are now at a new location. Sushi on Bloor has solid value for what you get and they have a fantastic lunch special from 12-5pm. This part of Bloor street between Bathurst and Spadina features several sushi restaurants but this is my go to place. Some appetizers I would recommend are the Honour roll, seafood salad and ikayaki. You also get 10% off for takeout orders. Be warned that there is often a lineup so if you do go, don't get there when you're already starving. Or, get takeout and enjoy at home."}
{"text":"I love it here because the service is FAST and the food is CHEAP. Their lunch special options are $7.75 and the bento boxes are super filling. 

I would recommend this place to anyone. It's very busy at lunch, but they don't rush you to finish your food. The food itself is consistently great. 

Of the many sushi places on bloor, this one is the busiest because it is fast, tasty, reliable and affordable."}
{"text":"Hands down this will always be my favourite sushi place to go to. For the price you pay and the portion you receive, it is beyond fair. The rolls are fresh and they're very generous with the sushi rice. They also supply complimentary miso soup (for lunch + dinner) and ice cream (dinner), which to me always a plus. Due to the low prices, the place seemingly is always packed so you need to have a patience mindset before coming here to eat."}
{"text":"There's a load of Sushi shops to pick from on this street but Sushi on Bloor stands out for its value, free salad/soup/ice cream, nice ambience and of course, delicious sushi. Try their combinations if you can't make up your mind. The only flip side is the wait to be seated. It can get crowded"}
{"text":"Going in, I knew I was going to have to wait a while. We were a group of three, there was already a group of four people ahead of us, and the place was packed. The hostess wouldn't give us an estimation of how long the wait was.That's fine. I've heard the sushi is totally worth the wait.
What's not fine is that during the 45-60 minutes that we were waiting for a table, 5 groups of two people each were seated ahead of us. There was at least one situation we saw where the waitress could have pushed two tables together so we could be seated, but instead seating two separate couples. 
Ok, fine. This sushi better be good. 
The sushi was good. Not great. Not worth a nearly hour long wait. The prices were ok on average. Some pieces were a good deal, some were over priced. Thankfully the food came quick, although we never did receive one of the items we ordered, despite being charged for it at the end of the meal.

Would I go back if I was in the area? Sure, but not if there's a line. If we had gotten lucky with our timing, I'm sure this would have been a much more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Um, hello, $5.99 lunch specials?

Sushi On Bloor rules. It has everything you could possibly want on the menu, for a dollar cheaper than the price you expect. Want yummy Gyoza? Hmm...I'm guessing an app would be about $4.50 or $5? Try $3. Tempura appetizer with a bunch of veggies and huge shrimp? $5.

If you go in the mid-afternoon, just before dinner time, you will get a nice seat, your tea will arrive within seconds, you'll get the lunch special ($5.99 for 16 pieces of sushi!) and you can order and receive your food in no time. The only complaint I had was that their rolls were heavy on the rice, but I just picked it off and went on my merry way.

Might not be the best restaurant in the city, but sometimes all you want is cheap, delicious sushi and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"The price is right, beehatch! 

Ahem.

Casually constructed sushi at casual prices--good bang for your buck, and the most critical component of the meal--the quality of the fish used--was solid.  The beeef and I shared the golden veggie platter, sushi pizza, and a special roll whose name I cannot recollect (standard tempura flakes, three kinds of fish, avocado) and it was all tasty.  

We went fairly late (busy but not packed) and the service was reasonably prompt.  

Ambience? Very  \"five tablespoons of ice-cream on plate + flurorescent lighting\".  Sushi on Bloor fulfils the craving for mid-range sushi, and I'd definitely come through its doors again to fulfil that objective."}
{"text":"Um, yuuuuuuuuuum. 
I have never had fresher salmon. Nor have I ever had delicious grilled eggplant soaked in miso sauce for about four dollars. And it came with free ice cream, which of course made it a hit with me. My date was disappointed that they didn't have butter fish, and our table was a bit wobbly, but...an appetizer, three rolls, and a big platter of sashimi came to only $28. And it sure was tasty."}
{"text":"I walked around Bloor and Bathurst looking for a place for lunch. All the places seemed to be deserted, but lo and behold, Sushi on Bloor was packed.

We entered the restaurant, and we were quickly shown to our table. We didn't take long to decide what we wanted to eat: We both had the chicken teriyaki lunch special for $5.99 which is a bento box style lunch. It includes tea, miso soup, salad, avocado sushi rolls, rice and chicken teriyaki. We also had a salmon teriyaki roll and spicy tuna roll on the side.

The miso soup was delicious. It was probably the best miso soup I've ever had. The bento box itself was pretty tasty, and for $5.99 it was a great value! The only negative thing I can say about the bento box is that the salad wasn't very fresh, but even that didn't stop me from eating, and enjoying it.

The salmon teriyaki roll was amazing, definitely one of the best I've had in Toronto. The spicy tuna roll was okay. I felt it wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, since it tasted like a regular tuna roll. The person I was with greatly enjoyed both rolls, so maybe I'm way too picky when it comes to my spicy tuna.

Service can be a little slow, but nothing you can't handle. It took a while for our waitress to come and clear the table, and she seemed swamped by having to deal with so many tables and customers. They should consider hiring more people.


Sushi on Bloor is great value for your money. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Truly the best sushi I have found in Toronto (and I eat sushi on the regular). Their rolls are generously sized and fish is fresh and very flavourful. Components of their rolls are consistently well-balanced - no skimping on the fish only to overload on the rice or avocado. Fish-heavy rolls (e.g. basic salmon roll, spicy tuna) have nicely cut, whole pieces of fish, unlike many other restaurants where the fish is chopped or ground and loses its raw texture. My usual order for two is four rolls of varying complexity, gyoza or tempura appetizer, and a beer each, which consistently runs $35-40. Fantastic value and again, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I always get the chicken karage and supreme bento box. You get so much good food at a reasonable price. My go to sushi place."}
{"text":"What happened?!

SOB used to be consistent, affordable and fast. I ordered take out last night on my way home and I was dismayed to see what passed for acceptable food in the new location.

My hand rolls were damp. The formally crispy nori was limp and falling to pieces. Everything was just sort of \"meh\". My Crunchy Roll was almost inedible. The crunchy bits were oil soaked and mush. 

I bought 2 meals and an an extra roll for lunch, but I'm so disappointed that I'm not going to go back. After almost 15 years of patronage, that's saying something."}
{"text":"Always a super busy spot, but luckily the food gets to you quickly after ordering. Haven't had anything I dislike here!"}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. A bit crowded for the dinner crowd, so come early. Can't beat their prices. Sushi is always good. Service is good for their crowded restaurant. I really dont have much to complain about this place. Def worth a visit."}
{"text":"I hate Sushi on Bloor. My girlfriends think it is soooo good but they have no idea what they are talking about. The service is mediocre and the food is complete shit. No way that is even close to what sushi should taste like! Never order raw fish, especially after they failed to pass their health inspection, and make sure you don't order too much, big orders confuse them! They bring out food with out any consideration for who ordered it or any kind of actual order. Once my girlfriend ordered Chicken Terryaki and it didn't come until we were ready for the bill. Never go to Sushi on Bloor unless you want a parasite."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto, so it's my first time for Toronto sushi...or Canadian sushi, for that matter.  Thanks to Yelpers for pointing the place out.

I ordered the Gold Sashimi; it came with 18 pieces, including amaebi, maguro, tako, hamachi, ika, hokkigai, white tuna, & sake.  Not a bad spread; and they didn't include fillers like egg(although I do like it), kani, shrimp, and other really cheap sushi.  Very generous portions, but I could tell some of the fish was frozen/thawed several times(tuna looked great but was watery, as were the shrimp, and the ika was still icy.)  I would give the sushi 3/5.

I also got the grilled squid, a small Sapporo, miso soup, & salad...all for...and here's the kicker... $27!  My meal, tax, tip, everything, was $36CAD!  And that's not even ordering takeout, which is apparently 20% cheaper.  With a favorable exchange rate right now, at $.79:$1CAD, this was probably the most affordable sushi I've ever eaten for the quality.  

The decor is lacking, so this isn't a first date type of place, but the food, compared to the price, is a no-brainer.  I would like to come back some day and try other things on the menu; the squid was great so I'm guessing their other cooked items are excellent as well."}
{"text":"This used to be my standby cheap sushi place in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Loved the sushi pizza and the free ice cream!  

However, new management took over and expanded the place, and it became a nightmare for a couple of reasons.  First, is that they have a really bad reservation system.  If you reserve for a certain time, you still have to wait at least half an hour to get your seat.  And the last two times I went, I had food poisoning from the sushi.... unfortunately I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"This is the worst place in all of toronto - their food is great but their staff is the rudest bunch of people you could ever possibly encounter!

We waited for 56 minutes only to not be seated because the table was for 4 but we were only 2 - despite the fact that we got there 20 minutes before the table of 4 

We mentioned to the \"host\" that we were there first and he tried to stick us in the back corner at the \"sushi bar\" 

We have been going almost every other weekend for 6 months and will NEVER GO AGAIN

Thier floor is also slippery and a hazard... I fell on the ay out and not a single member of their incompetent staff came to see if I was okay

I sincerely hope they go out of business"}
{"text":"this is my joint for value sushi... well i hardly call it sushi.. bento box is more like it.. 

very good value.. although it might not satisfy my sashimi craving .. it hits the spot in a variety aspect... you get rice, 3 pieces of salmon roll/ 3 pieces cucumber roll, chicken teriyaki, fruit, salad and soup... guaranteed to make you full... but then top it off you also get ice cream on the house...  out the door price is about 12-13 dollars...  not bad"}
{"text":"I have to say there are many sushi/Japanese restaurants in downtown Toronto, but Sushi on Bloor has got to be the best place I have been so far.

Sushi on Bloor is not an \"all-you-can-eat-sushi\" place, but for the same price you pay to go for all you can eat, you can still stuff your face here but get better food! I have been here 2 so far, it was highly recommended and at dinner, there's almost always a wait time of 10-30min. The meal comes with free tea, miso soup and ice cream at the end. In terms of rolls, they are around $5 each. You can also get a variety of teriyaki, salads and Asian appetizers. I have tried the Bloor street roll when consist of a very thick layer of raw salmon with tobiko in the center and mint. The amount of seafood served is incredible! The regular rolls, such as rainbow and dragon etc are equally as good. The salads are great here too, if you like greens to go along with your meal, you can pick from a few different salads, examples are seafood salad and avocado salad). Although, the dressing is standard for all salads (the really tasty orangy seafood dressing), so if you are not too fond of the dressing then you should order something else. If you order teriyaki, each order comes with a serving of plain salad with dressing.

There are also, combos and bento boxes available. The combos are relatively cheaper, but I find that they are not as good as the rolls.

Overall, definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Really wondering if the servers have ever been trained.... 

Firstly, you -serve- the customer 
Secondly, you don't mock the customer in front of them
Thirdly, you ensure they're enjoying the meal they are paying for
And lastly, you do not tell the customer what they ordered when in fact they weren't listening in the first place.

If you hate your job this much, just quit.

The food isn't even worth it."}
{"text":"Fast service, cheap price, decent Toronto sushi.  It is super busy inside but has a large upstairs so finding seating is usually doable.  Overall not a bad option for day-to-day sushi but not something remarkable.  Why doesn't this city have better sushi??"}
{"text":"My family spent many meals here for years because they're speedy, consistent and affordable.

ATMOSPHERE: This places is standard. Fast, lively, reliable. Almost always packed here and noise level may be loud. They have 2 floors, and so can accommodate large parties. I prefer to sit upstairs. It's more quiet and you can actually enjoy a conversation with your party.

Reservations recommended. But a long line going out the door is a regular occurrence here.

SERVICE: Speedy service as they try to keep the crowd moving through the door. They're pretty well staff and respond quickly to requests. But as mentioned, there's usually a bit of waiting for a table.

PRICE: Great deal - good for students or people looking for affordable Japanese cuisine. May have some of the best Japanese lunch specials in town.

FOOD: Not the best in town (own and operated by Chinese, not Japanese) but with their prices, you really can't complain. Never had any issue with food quality and they've been pretty consistent on every visit.

It's no wonder they continue to be so popular!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go to Sushi in Toronto, I've been coming here since elementary school (9 years ago), and it's still fantastic. Love the place. Supreme bento box all the way! And if it's available the Butter Fish Teriyaki!"}
{"text":"Food is decently priced and excellent.  Always tastes fresh.  Would frequent the spot when they were at the other location, have not made it to their new location, but assuming management has remained the same I would definitely recommend this spot for a bite to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is still five solid stars, but I thought I'd update my review. 

They raised their lunch special prices to $6.99, all substitutions are now one dollar and they no longer take 15% off for take-out orders. Do these things annoy me? Yes. Is it still the freshest sushi in the annex at the cheapest prices? Yep!

A summer favourite of mine is getting S1 and S3 (detailed in my older review) to go and hanging out in Christie Pits. You should try it. 

Happy summer sushi-ing!

PEPPER POINTS for their green salad dressing. Fresh ginger, not ginger mayo. Refreshing."}
{"text":"If I had to pick ONE restaurant to eat at for the rest of my life. It would be Sushi on Bloor, hands down. 

I was first introduced to Sushi on Bloor and became an instant fan. I am also an avid promoter of this joint, by bringing every single friend here. Everyone always feels the same as myself.

The quality is always there and never disappoints. I love their lunch specials, even though they jacked up the price by a dollar and decreased the time to take advantage of the lunch special. But regardless, they always have me coming back. Dining in is usually a treat. They serve bottomless green tea and ice cream at the end. But take out is SPEEDY. Seriously. They'll be PACKED and I'll still get my takeout order in 15 minutes or less. Amazing.

Efficient. Tasty. Fresh. Perfection.

Mmmm. Now I want sushi.

Personal favorite: Makimono set."}
{"text":"SOB has been a favourite of mine for over a decade. In fact, now that I'm not within their immediate delivery area, I still opt to pay an additional $3 surcharge so they'll deliver to me...it's that great!
The food is always so fresh, portion sizes are always amazingly huge (in comparison to other sushi places where they seem to skimp out on the fish, and give you extra rice instead). 
Just love it. Can't say enough. 
In person, you may need to wait to get seated (it's always busy), but it's definitely worth the wait. In-person ambiance is nothing remarkable, but the food is great."}
{"text":"Go to Sushi place. It is always packed. Often a disaster trying to get in (not very organized), but absolutely delicious and great value. Go to place with friends.

I am a vegetarian, so full disclosure I do not eat fish, so I am not comment on freshness or anything. I love it though!

Lunch specials go to 5, so if you go early you can get really cheap dinner!"}
{"text":"It's cheap, the sushi itself isn't great, but the portions are large. You can order tempura udon for $8.75 with a huge portion of tempura. The sushi has too much rice, and is kind of messy. I would also suggest going early, say around 7pm to beat the lines."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great food at a great price. 
Seriously, no complaints. 

For ~$8.50 during lunch time, you can get a filling meal. They have bento boxes, sushi roll combos, curry and rice, chicken katsu and rice, and other combinations of items for around this price during their lunch period. Good. Stuff. Most of the combos come with miso soup and a salad - these are good too and taste fine. 

Because of the good lunch prices, it gets really crowded here. Try and come early to beat the lunch rush or you'll end up waiting in line for about 10-15 minutes."}
