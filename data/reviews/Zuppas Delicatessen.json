{"text":"Looked for a quick, but good, lunch out of the office and found it. The wedding soup was great and a 1/2 a chicken artichoke paninni. Friendly chef, quick service, and it was delicious. Do not go to fast food when u can get a great sandwich or soup here."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday after seeing a client in the building.  I frequent their original location in Wexford but didn't know they had opened another location.  It was in the morning so I only had a breakfast sandwich but as with everything at Zuppa's it was very good.  Bobby's mother (I think her name is Linda if I remember correctly) made a bunch of cookies so I bought a tin of anisette which were really great.   If she has cookies out when you are there, pay the $3 and bring some home.  I'm really glad to see these guys branching out.  It's a good concept, the food is always top notch and they are all very nice people.  I am happy to see them succeed."}
{"text":"Really delicious , perfect soups! And the sandwiches are generous and very good. So nice to have an independent location in the midst of chai fast food purgatory. Hopefully we support this nice establishment!"}
{"text":"Food is EXCELLENT. The chicken salad, soups and Mac and cheese are all fantastic. I just think it's very expensive for a soup and salad joint, and the portions are SMALL. You can easily spend $20 and walk out still hungry!"}
{"text":"The lettuce on my salmon salad was rotten not just a little rotten, large amounts were rotten. The salmon tasted okay, a bit bland though. The chicken panini was fine."}
{"text":"Excellent prices along with delicious house made soups and salads! Love all of their soups- especially the corn and shrimp chowder. So glad they opened up this new location!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Just destroys Panera. The paninis and soups are just excellent. They are slightly pricey but you're getting really good quality food!"}
{"text":"Was nearby for business and found it on Yelp. Great place for a quick and delicious lunch! The owner was working behind the counter, super friendly and attentive. I had the pick two, with a half roast beef panini and a cup of spicy shrimp and corn chowder. Was fast and really tasty. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised. They offer breakfast, soup, salads, sandwiches and also have a kids menu. It's a cute and casual atmosphere but doesn't have a ton of seating. Seems like a great quick lunch place.  I got wedding soup and a cannoli. The wedding soup was delicious but the cannoli was AMAZING. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"So happy that Zuppas had come to fox chapel/hatmarville. I used to go there in Wexford all the time. Then moved my office and was always disappointed with lunch opportunities.I was there yesterday and it remains by far the best deli in the area. You can't go wrong with the soups and Paninis."}
{"text":"So happy to have found this place through using a Local Flavor deal. I tried the spicy shrimp and corn chowder which was delicious (and had whole small shrimp in it too as well as I presume blended in as well)and a full Caesar salad with chicken, also very good. I am looking forward to coming back but a bit bummed with the high prices. Not sure if they rotate soups over the week but that would be fun :) they have an 8 under $8 menu but I presume these are really small?"}
{"text":"We've now been to both locations - and were happy with both! Everything is made to order: the salads are fresh and loaded; the soups are outstanding; and, the mac & cheese is killer. This visit, I had a chicken, bacon, artichoke, white bean, ranch panini - and it was out of this world. And, for lunch, they have 8 options for $8 - a great deal! I highly recommend Zuppas!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden jewel in Harmarville. It's worth finding the location and once you find it you'll be back again and again. It's a comfortable place with lots of seatings and easy parking. But the real draw is the food. The chef really gets how to make delicious food. The salmon is cooked for perfection, the salads are generous size and really taste great. The soups are among the best that you Will ever have. I don't think I've ever had a better tomato bisque soup.   Each sandwiches in unique and worth trying.  Their mac & cheese and deviled eggs are really comfort food. Lots of things to try you'll be back again and again"}
