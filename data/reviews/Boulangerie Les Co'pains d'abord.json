{"text":"I don't really agree with the first review, this restaurant is really good, we taste the mapple chicken, WONDERFULL, and the \"pulled pork\" sandwich with a creamy pepper sauce, AMAZING! And you definitely have to taste the \"ratatouille\". They have a good selection of wine too for the evening. They serve the food really fast too for the lunch. They are selling a really good \"foccacia bred\" to go!   I'll surely come back to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We wanted a quick dinner, something simple. We order the Cesar salad (very good) and a combo plate with pork and chicken breast (maple). I really liked the pork but found breast just ok. Tasted good but was a bit dry. The Harissa mayo we got wasn't spicy at all. The ratatouille that came with plate was nice but the dauphine potatoes were disappointing. I give it an ok."}
{"text":"On a Friday evening after a stressful week and you are hungry, sometimes your hunger make the restaurant choice over your brain. Sometimes it's a mistake, sometimes it's a find and sometimes it's so so. This place was definitely the later.  Not having a lot of time now, I just want to get something up, so you can make a better decision before going to this new restaurant that is somewhat overpriced for what you get overall (as you know these days a decent sit down get served restaurant experience is rarely much under $50 all-in if you drink any alcohol at all). In a nut shell the reason this place gets an OK is this...One server was polite and the other curt. One dish was above average (the caesar salad) and one dish was below average (the mozzarella basil pizza - where's the basil?). I will say that both red wines by the glass were nice (one Spanish and one Bordeaux) and the thick cut bacon in the caesar salad was a stand out. Fresh cracked pepper and some spiced olive oil distracted me from the plain tasting pizza (for $2.25 you can find a better slice in the same town). I am not a ranter so I will say in closing that the ambiance is fresh and clean (very woody) and I truly believe they mean well in creating the simple recto-verso one page menu, with three main sections; salad, rotisserie chicken and pizzas. If you are one to give a place a chance to tweak some recipes and general growing pains, why not - otherwise there are other places to spend abut $50 all in and get a much better satisfaction after your credit card is swiped than L.C.D.A."}
