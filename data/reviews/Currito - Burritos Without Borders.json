{"text":"I had a pretty decent experience here for an airport fast-food eatery. First, I love that one can have tofu as a choice of \"meat\" and that opens up possibilities for a vegetarian. And yes, several choices for meatheads. :-) You have the choice of portion size and white or whole wheat tortilla. I ordered a small, whole wheat tofu Bangkok burrito, which was pretty tasty, especially the slaw that have a zing. Tofu texture was firm. The portion was enough to tide me over until my layover in Chicago.  The customer service was somewhat of a pleasant surprise as they were accommodating and friendly with my request to mix lemonade and ice tea, and all of my questions. Last year I had a \"run-in\" with a lady at Quiznos (I think) who wouldn't make food 30 minutes before closing time. I'm sure she wouldn't have thought twice about smacking me for asking.  For cleanliness, I honestly wasn't looking around much, but nothing gross stuck out. The communal eating area shared by patrons of all of the fast food joints was a bit dirty, but I can't really blame that on Currito.  I'd give 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I eat here every time I need lunch at the airport.  I've only had the summer burrito, because it always sounds better than anything else on the menu.  Tastes great!  The price for build-your-own is high, but any of their pre-defined burritos are very reasonably priced, especially for airport food.  The small summer burrito was $5.49, and \"small\" looked pretty normal-sized to me."}
{"text":"Not a bad alternative to Moe's, Qdoba, or Chipotle. Service was excellent on our first visit. They even split the single drink ordered for our 2 boys into separate cups for us (one less thing for them ti fight over).  They just serve burritos and salads, but the twist is that there's Cajun, Bangkok, Teriyaki, Summer, Mediterranean, and Buffalo style/ingredients besides the make your own or classic burrito. We'll be back for a second visit."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a cheese breakfast quesadilla with guacamole.  Well the guacamole was spicy and the quesadilla was flavorless.  Definitely will not be back to this place!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican and I love fusion food. I had tried Thai burrito last year at a different place and I love the idea of mixing up things in a burrito for new tastes! So today I tried the Tikka burrito here and absolutely loved the flavours. So it had chickpeas instead of the kidney beans, tikka curry sauce instead of the regular sauce and I took tofu guacamole (cheaper than at chipotle) and kale(freeeee add-on!!) to relish a really good currito!! Totally recommend! Although I have a small appetite and thought the portion size was perfect for me, I doubt that it would be enough for some others. For comparison sakes, I never finish my bowl at chipotle and always have to take away 1/4th of it atleast, but I know that it's perfect portion size for so many people I have been to chipotle with!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!  A must try is the chicken caesar salad with croutons and kale (recommend by the new friendly manager).  Service was quick and very generous.   Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"The chicken tikka burrito was very delicious and filling and the manager gave my son a free cookie. Fast, friendly service and good, reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"I've seen Currito restaurants in a couple airports and finally decided to try this location at PIT a couple days ago.  I ended up getting about what I expected to get, though: an overpriced burrito that didn't taste quite right.  I tried the Thai curry burrito with chicken, and while the ingredients all seemed correct and Thai or Thai-inspired, something about the combination of the tortilla and the peanut sauce destroyed the whole meal for me.  It also didn't help that my burrito was two-thirds rice and the remainder contained very little chicken.  Another reviewer here mentioned trying the \"classic\" burrito instead of any of the fancy or ethnic-related burritos, and based on my experience, that's probably very good advice."}
{"text":"The only airport food I look forward to eating!!  It's only appropriate such an awesome city (Pitt) would have the best little burrito shop in their airport :)"}
{"text":"Nice people and awesome food. Surprised to see this nice quality of food at an airport. For a vegetarian its a surprise to see so many different options to build a burrito!"}
{"text":"The Tikka burrito with chicken is pretty damn tasty. A nice change from the other burrito chains. I just wish they'd cut back on the salt and give you a tray or papper plate."}
{"text":"Currito is a nice alternative to a typical Mexican-themed burrito place, as they provide you with many healthy options to creating your burrito.  They also have a tasty smoothie station in which the employees will grudgingly prepare for you.  And along with that note, this restaurant provides the worst customer service I have ever experienced.. period.  The servers are either extremely rude, or merely spaced out.  Either way, it has been a terrible experience every time I have eaten there, and wouldn't recommend it unless you like to be patronized (or ignored) by the worker \"curreating\" your burrito."}
{"text":"For airport food, pretty good. Seemed fresh. Tasty. Large portion. Made to order and not over priced."}
{"text":"Don't bother eating here. It is painfully obvious that no one working here, let alone management has ever been in a Chipotle or Qdoba's. They were anxious to take my order and money but they were not interested in customizing my meal to my likes. At the cash register I was asked if I wanted hot sauce and I said yes. I'm not sure about you but for most people that's a highly personalized item to put on the burrito bowl that I ordered. Before I knew it they had ladled a massive amount of fire into my meal and ruined it. I would have said make it light. When I asked for lettuce for my bowl the girl acted like she was put out. There's lots of other options at the airport. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"If you're a traveler it's obvious Pittsburgh has one of the worst food selection for major airports in North America. Poor, fast food chains litter the place. Meanwhile, Currito, an obvious Moe's, Chipotle, Rubio's, Salsarita, Baja Fresh, Qdoba, etc, knock off is one of the better options in the terminal area. It's not great, by any means, but it's average, which is a big accomplishment here.   Don't expect to find friendly, welcoming service here, however. Even the manager walked by us waiting to be helped and she didn't lift a finger to accommodate. The woman behind us nearly walked away after waiting for five minutes before someone even acknowledged here. A class in leadership would benefit those in charge here. The lack of caring stands out, unfortunately.   Meanwhile, the meats aren't bad. They are in line with the above mentioned chains, and taste almost identical, in fact. You can also order wheat or white tortillas and build your own burrito or go with one of their pre-thought-up options. They also have various sauces in bottles that can be squeezed on to spice up the flavor a bit. The salsas are average, the guacamole is average as are the veggies, but in this airport, average is a good thing.   On a positive note, check out of the prices. The regular burrito, which is more than enough for any human to eat, is a steal when compared to prices you see at most airports."}
{"text":"Sad this place closes tomorrow. I was always greeted with friendly service and. Great burrito. Thank you everyone who works here!"}
{"text":"I was in the terminal and looking for a place to grab a bite to eat.  I wasn't sure what to get but I ended up with Currito.  They do a good job of keeping the line moving, and I needed something fast so that was a plus.  I went with the make your own burrito and chose chicken.  It's all your pretty standard burrito toppings - and I got my usual fixings that I would get  at similar burrito type shops.  This particular burrito definitely did not live up to my hype.  It was a little on the flavorless side, the hot sauce wasn't at all spicy (I like a nice kick to my burrito) and it didn't stay wrapped together too well.  By no means was the burrito inedible, it just wasn't very good.  I even asked for extra hot sauce - just not a spicy one, I guess.  The prices weren't too bad and it's a quick meal - two of the definite pluses for this place.  If you're looking for a quick, average burrito - this place would probably get the job done."}
{"text":"It was so amazing to note that the reviews I read before trying out this place was so perfect. Good meat, good veg choices, and poor service. In my opinion it is probably lack of training. There was no involvement or attempt to be courteous. I might still go back to this place for its good food and value for money! Four stars for food and two for service!"}
{"text":"In short, for airport food and price this is about as good as it gets!  My wife and I ate here on our way out of Pittsburgh.  I wouldn't compare it to Chipotle as some reviewers have (yes, it is a build-your-own-burrito place, but the flavors are much different - Chipotle seems much more clinical to me).  The theme of this place is \"Burritos without Borders\" and they have pre-made selections that represent flavors from different countries, which I think is very cool.  My wife got a vegetarian burrito with tofu and I got a pork burrito.  They were both excellent - if they weren't we would really only have ourselves to blame since they put whatever we asked them to inside.  For airport food, I don't think it gets much better.  As with any fast food chain, I'm sure the quality of servers can vary, but both of the young ladies that helped us were very respectful, informative and friendly - so much so that I even got their names to compliment them in this review.   Alec and Sarah S., listened to what we wanted and did a great job getting our meals together!  Thanks for putting a cool ending to our time in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"On my way out of Pittsburgh, I stop by this small little Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh international airport. It's not really a restaurant, but fast food counter kiosk, which caters to the traveling public in and out of Pittsburgh PA. I was kind of impressed with them although it's airport food.  I was recommended this place by Facebook friend of mine, who never steered me wrong yet in terms of traveling and eating on the go. His past recommendation was a pizza joint in terminal B in the heart of Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson international airport and it was pretty good. Onward to round two, where he suggested Currito's here at Pittsburgh international airport. I noticed this fast food kiosk after passing through TSA security checkpoint at Pittsburgh international airport. It was on my way to the gate, so I remembered what my friend had told me. It was already dinner time, so I ended up grabbing a burrito to take with me on the plane and eat it at 35,000 feet. What can you expect from a fast food counter kiosk, but friendly and fetching fast food here that will keep you on your toes while trying to keep you grounded while waiting for your flight out of Pittsburgh.  For what I was worth, I was glad that Curitto's was basically in between my gate and the TSA security check point, so I didn't need to actually look for it since it was literally on my way. Happy about that.  The overall experience here at Currito's was pretty much touch and go. Being that it was an airport food kiosk, there wasn't any seats designated for dine in, do you're pretty much need to have everything bagged up and eaten at the gate or somewhere nearby. I ended up having my burrito in Houston (IAH) international airport while waiting for my connection to Phoenix Arizona (PHX). Currito's is located at the Pittsburgh international airport, so it's not hard to find, really. They accept major credit cards, do that's always a great thing, especially because you're in an airport and 90% of people would naturally whip out their plastic to pay for their food. The prices here were reasonable, since being at the airport, it's already pricey to begin with, but $10 for a delicious burrito?? That's pricey! What can you do? Obviously, eating before coming to airport, but this place may be the next best thing. The burritos here are legit and may be worth it! Mine was delicious and full of flavors i haven't experienced in a long time.  I decided to try the tikka burrito, since that was the first item on the top of the menu board. It has been a long time since I had Indian food, so it was a real treat to have it for dinner. I just got the burrito and not the sides nor a drink. The burrito itself was definitely full of flavor and spicy and meaty at the same time. Oh no it wasn't worth the $10 that I paid, something about having this burrito made it kind of satisfying and kind of worth it. At the end of the day, it's just a burrito and could be the one that would make or break your evening. It made my stomach happy with the tikka burrito, so it was nice even for fast food service at the Pittsburgh international airport. I was flying united airlines, so I was in terminal 2 at the time. I'd recommend checking this place out, since they have a limited range of flavors. The tikka one caught my eye, since I have not had Indian for a long time.  4.0 stars for the burrito, 3.5 stars for the service. In and out and then walk/run to your gate to make it to your flight.   Support local!  B-"}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food! I really try to eat somewhat healthy, but going to Pittsburgh for a business trip I had a little more unhealthy stuff than usual and I wanted something light before getting on the flight. The cheese quesadilla sounded like it would fit the bill...and it really did!  It was actually a lot bigger than I expected and I asked for both sour cream and salsa and had a ton! Seriously they gave me a LOT, which as awesome as I love both!!   The people were friendly and the prices, while high because it's airport food, weren't too terrible. The food was good and hot, and I would definitely eat here again if I were ever in the Pittsburgh airport!"}
{"text":"We had a long day of travel due to delays, so I was looking for an early evening salad before we boarded the next flight. I went to the nature restaurant in the center of PIA, but they weren't making salads. They were serving pre-made salads with dressing and I was concerned about the length of time they'd been there. I walked over to this newer restaurant and saw that they had a romaine and kale salad.  Perfect or so I thought.  I added chicken and paid.  The lettuce was limp, especially the kale. It was wilting and tasted really bad. The chicken was super dry and it was scooped from a prep station for burritos. This is a burrito place, so I should not have ordered a salad.  It looks like they had a good selection of burritos, so perhaps that's a better choice.  Due to flight delays this was one I'd my only healthy options.  Pass on the salad, travelers."}
{"text":"Baby loved his breakfast so much he came back for a second. Tasty food. S little too much Rosemary or parsley on the potatoes but very good airport food. Great bang for your buck too... Especially for an airport. Thanks Ashley and Ericka!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Why have I not seen it in other cities and airports? I like to order salads with as many things possible on them, and there were virtually no restrictions here. Some of the toppings were seasoned chickpeas, black beans, hummus, and lots of different vegetables and salsas. The grilled chicken was also delicious. And all for $8 including tax. Service was quick and great and perfect for between flights."}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Same concept as Chipotle.  I had a build your own burrito with chicken. Was in and out in no time. Freshly made and reasonable price for airport. Something different than the other offers."}
{"text":"You want to gross out totally before 7am?? Go to this burrito joint at Pittsburgh Int'l! The kid running the counter this morning should seriously consider his chances of ever landing a real job. Ditto for his female assistant because they were both so bad at that job that it made me wonder: if you can't do THIS JOB, what job CAN you do??? We ordered 2 egg and cheese burritos. They came with salsa. I asked for one to have the salsa on the side because I didn't want a soggy burrito. My guy didn't care. These two moved like dead fish. Sooooo slow! We were the only ones in line at the time. The girl started our burritos and (Here's where it gets gross) the eggs were the runniest things I've ever seen. The high school cafeteria is better no kidding! The girl put the burritos together, warmed them up in some contraption, and then gave them to me with 2 napkins. I asked for more because these burritos were obviously going to be drippy regardless of the salsa! She handed me two more. Really? Can you spare it?? Ok so she doesn't say which one has salsa and which one doesn't so we try to figure it out and realize neither has salsa!!! Awful experience!!"}
{"text":"Pretty terrible service. Employees were slow and unfamiliar with the menu items, kept asking guests what goes in their signature burritos.   I ordered a burrito with tofu which I was charged for before being informed they only had half the amount of tofu needed to make the burrito. Left frustrated and feeling hoodwinked.   The manager seems component but he shouldn't have to stay on the line constantly to make the location work."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Never got to the food.  I went there at 6:00 pm and ordered a quesadilla.  The clerk said it was to late and they weren't making anymore today.  Really!  It's the dinner hour, your open for business, and you refuse to take an order for food.   When I inquired why I found out they were still serving attitude.  Never again."}
{"text":"Great place with very nice people! Helped us when we needed to change our order with no problem. Thanks!"}
{"text":"When you've got to find dinner at an airport, your expectations are low. You are pretty much hoping that you can get through your meal with no tears or nausea. This is especially true if you are a vegetarian.   One night when I was stranded at the airport for four or five hours, I discovered this place. Guess what? It's good. If you are a non-meat person you will be happy to discover that they have tofu and brown rice. If you order something spicy, that's the way you'll get it.   This afternoon I brought my girlfriend for here lunch on our way to the Jetblue gate. She ordered the Summer Burrito, which I thought was a risky choice-- it comes with mango salsa, which I expected to be sweet corn-syrup infused jelly. Currito took my cynical, negative expectations, knocked them over, and made rough-love to them with real pieces of mango and fresh onions. Thanks, Currito!   So yeah, this place gets five stars, because it's the best food I've had at an airport. If it was around the corner from me in New York city, I would still be pretty happy to eat here."}
{"text":"Currito is a knock-off burrito place in the vein of Chipotle or Qdoba. The food was fresh and decent. I had to try the \"Tikka Massala\" burrito just for the originality factor. It was amusing - a chicken burrito with chick peas and mild Indian-themed sauce.   I was not blown away. I was not disappointed. I was on an hour delay on my flight, so time was not a factor. I can't remember if they served it up quickly or not.    You will get a better-than-fast-food burrito here."}
{"text":"Their ultimate chicken quesadilla is probably the best I've had! And their Chicken Tikka Burrito is good too!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, food tastes good. Not bad for an airport food court. They charge extra for guacamole, quinoa AND kale so my simple bowl ended up being 11 bucks. This is my second Curritos in a week in totally different states!"}
{"text":"A little better than your typical food court meal.  The ingredients are fresh and the service is fast.  I had the Mediterranean and was pretty good."}
{"text":"When I find myself needing a speedy meal in the Pittsburgh airport, I head here for the tikka burrito. Or sometimes the Thai burrito, which is good too but not my favorite. Love that you can sub quinoa for the rice, and that a small burrito is available.  I see some of the other reviews note questionable service - I had a delightful experience today FWIW."}
{"text":"Nice surprise in the center of the Pittsburgh mall! I was searching for something different for lunch. I ordered a Burrito Bowl which was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick salad to eat on my flight back to NYC. The currito house salad with chicken was on point! Guac/feta/ Tex men veggies, definitely one of the better choices when running for a flight. Not the quickest but if you have a solid 15 minutes you're good!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a breakfast burrito and ordered the build your own burrito for 5.99. As it turns out, they ran out of potatoes so it actually makes zero sense to pay the extra dollar to build your own burrito since the egg, cheese, and chorizo/bacon is 4.99--the only ingredients they did have.  FYI the chorizo tastes like ground beef and resembles Taco Bell.  Goodbye, Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Not your average Airport Burrito.  I was very happy with my Tikka burrito (w/ Chicken).  Slightly spicy and solid value."}
{"text":"Interesting, but not bad. I haven't been here since this was the airport Qdoba, years ago now. I WAS just gonna get a chicken quesadilla, but the tikka burrito piqued my interest, so I went for it. Surprisingly good! I'd get it again."}
{"text":"Not your average burrito place.  Here they do a bunch of different things with burritos such as the buffalo chicken burrito (one of my favorites), the Mediterranean burrito, and a Thai burrito just to name a few.  They of course also have a classic burrito if that's what you are in the mood for as well.  I go here almost every time I'm flying out from PIT."}
{"text":"This was an great, healthy alternative to the usual, often greasy, airport fare.  I ordered the Bankok burrito which comes with chicken by default and it was very tasty.   You can get other proteins such as pork or tofu as well.  The service was fine and they even had brewed iced tea (but unfortunately, no lemons).  Some of the chicken was a bit overdone on the outside.  The cucumber peel was a bit thick and could have benefited from being peeled a bit more and they do not give you plates to catch what drops on the table if you are into that but overall it was a nice chance of pace."}
{"text":"I will give the 4 stars on the airport scale, good value and quality graded on the curve. I had the chicken bowl witch was good and reasonable size, had a side of quacamole with chips and it was fresh and outstanding. Would definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"Stopped in early this morning for some much needed food.  I ordered a breakfast burrito with bacon amf potatoes.   They prepared it chipotle style.  The meal his the spot.  Burrito, large bottle of water, and large coffee was about $10 (great value since you are at an airport."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite to eat between flights. After seeing the mixed reviews I didn't expect much. The classic burrito was actually pretty good; very similar to chipotle  but slightly smaller portions. A soda, chips, salsa and burrito came to $10  which was actually pretty reasonable for an airport dinner."}
{"text":"Alec was awesome: so friendly and fun. Androniki hooked it up. Everyone was so nice and FAST!"}
{"text":"I would give it a three and a half. It's pretty good but not amazing. Had a tikka steak burrito. Steak was tender, everything else was fresh and pretty good. Given the options at this part of the airport, I would eat here again. Not bad."}
{"text":"I try to avoid eating airport food whenever possible, but sometimes it's unavoidable. Between having a 2:15pm scheduled departure (meaning I had to leave my apt. before noon to catch the 28X), and not having gone grocery shopping this past week, this Thurs. was one of those unavoidable times. Luckily, my employer footed the bill, as it was a business trip.  I was hoping to hit up Bar Symon, given that it seemed to have the best ratings and reviews in the PIT airport. However, by the time I made it through the TSA line, my flight was 10 min. from boarding, so I decided to opt for the nearest quick serve option that sounded interesting (for airport food...), and Currito fit the bill. I decided to try the Mediterranean burrito ($6.99) which I ordered as part of a combo with chips and guacamole ($3.49).  As appropriate for a fast food/fast casual stand in an airport, service was efficient, and my burrito was ready within 3 min. of ordering.  Because my flight began boarding as soon as I reached the gate, I was unable to consume my lunch until it was in the air. The burrito consisted mostly of rice, with a few pieces of grilled chicken, some veggies, and a tahini sauce. It was okay, but definitely not the best ever. I'll be the first to unabashedly admit that I'm not a diehard fan of Chipotle, but Chipotle's burritos are definitely a cut above the burritos served at Currito in terms of quality. I was also unimpressed with the guacamole, which contained no discernible hint of lime flavor. It did at least contain avocado chunks, though, indicating that it at least didn't originate in a tube.  Overall, I was unimpressed with my meal from Currito. As I mentioned, I have low standards for airport food, so Currito is no exception in that regard. It is better than the usual McD's, BK, etc. options, but not by that much. Next time I find myself needing food in the Pittsburgh airport, I'll try somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"Okay, I've gone here a few more times now, and I can tell you this: get the \"classic.\"    The other burritos are just... I dunno, they're not right.  The Cajun one hardly tasted Cajun at all, the Mediterranean was uninteresting as well, but the classic tasted wondrous.  The only thing that made me sad is that after 10AM you can't get chorizo.  Lame."}
{"text":"\"Burritos without borders\" is this franchaise's motto.  The menu features such ethnic diversities as: \"teriyaki burrito,\" \"mediterranean burrito,\"  \"bangkok burrito,\" etc. In other words, the restaurant concept might be described by an SAT-style analogy, Currito:burritos::CPK:pizzas  Nonetheless, I am a fan of the Currito in the Pittsburgh Airport because it offers a convenient and relatively healthy option among other food court offerings.  Their product tastes pretty fresh (for a fast food joint), and the serving size is reasonable. Plus, burritos are easy to eat on the go for travelers running to catch their next flight."}
{"text":"I ate there expecting something close to Chipotle in Southern California... But I was extremely disappointed... Their chicken summer burrito was subpar, 3/4 of the burrito was rice, and their guacamole tasted stale...  Won't try them again."}
{"text":"Went to order a burrito bowl. It was a struggle for their female worker to act like she wanted to help me. After I made the order, I was going to put in the second order. But I never had the chance. She ripped off the receipt. She never extended or asked if there was anything else.   I thought she was very rude and unhelpful.   Went next door to the marathon diner. It was a completely different 160 degree difference."}
{"text":"Dude at the counter was super quick. my order was sufficient with flavor. Not bad, not super. Probably not the best selection before a flight if you have no oral health kit for carry on."}
{"text":"So far it's the best bowl of pseudo Mexican food I've had. They have various indian toppings such as the chickpeas, tikka masala sauce etc. I never miss the opportunity to eat here when I'm at the airport.  The breakfast menu is also very good.  PS- don't take the hot sauces if you cannot handle some spice."}
{"text":"There are a lot of bad reviews of this place, but I have never had a bad experience here.  I have ordered the buffalo and tikka tofu burritos, they always are made fast and pretty good for airport food!  I like that they have healthy options (brown rice, whole wheat tortillas, kale, etc) and it's not that much--$6-8 per meal, unlike the usual $15+ you pay to eat at the airport.  I hope they stay open; it's my first choice if I'm stuck at PIT and hungry."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday while waiting for a flight at the airport.  There is not much to say about the appearance of the place other than it was clean as it is essentially a food court type place.  I cannot say that I was expecting much out of my meal as I had never heard of Currito before.  For my dinner I decided to have Buffalo Chicken Burrito which they put onto a Whole Wheat pita at my asking.  In addition to the Buffalo Chicken they also put blue cheese dressing, celery and rice onto the burrito.  The burrito exceeded any expectations that I had for it I thoroughly enjoyed it.   The bottom line for me is that I would definitely eat here again and I am looking forward to eating here the next time that I am at the airport.  Their  idea that burritos are not only Mexican food is a nice and refreshing change."}
{"text":"Our airport is so devastating when it comes to food options. Currito is no exception, although the food itself is literally the only redeeming quality. That is, if they make you the right thing.    The concept is good; assembly line of ingredients put into a bowl, burrito shell, etc.   However, the service is literally deplorable. I feel bad for the people working here. For those of you patronizing, you order. Then, your order prints out on a piece of paper aka receipt. This receipt is handed directly to the folks 'creating' your food. Unless, in my case, your receipt somehow is intercepted by aliens in between the cash register and the line (2 feet away, damn nimble aliens). Then, 6 minutes later, they realize they haven't made you something. When your receipt is reprinted, they still manage to mess up the contents of your burrito 'bowl', which is a standard menu item. Oh, and they're 'out' of at least 2 of the critical toppings.   Maybe McDonald's can teach them some basics on efficiency? Otherwise, great idea and fresh food lost to poor service. Sad face."}
{"text":"I'm usually very happy with Currito. However, this location was messy and not well run. Out of several items at 6:15pm. The peanut sauce container looked appalling. I seriously debated throwing my burrito in the trash after ordering and paying. I ate it and survived, so either I have a lead gut or my food poisoning fears were unfounded."}
{"text":"Inferior!  Inferior!  Inferior to Chipotle, I say!  Currito isn't bad for a mall food court burrito place, but the burritos themselves are INFERIOR. Firstly, the \"classic\" burrito only comes with pinto beans, not black beans, which I find offensive on so many levels (Why can't ya'll serve BLACK beans? 'Cause they're BLACK??? Hmph.) And the burrito was as bland as Qdoba's. The tomato chunks were much too big, which, I guess, is supposed to signal that they're chopped by hand, but choking on a tomato bit is not my choice of a way to die.   To top off my experience, the servers were champion space cadets. No greeting or any dressing to our verbal exchange... except for the guy who made my burrito, who whispered to me, \"For here or to go, sexy? You look good...\"  \"For here, thanks,\" I said.   Thanks for the burrito, sir. If it weren't for your wonky eye and the fact that you whispered the catcall instead of saying it out loud like you've got balls, I might have entertained you.  HA! Yeah right..."}
{"text":"Overview: Currito is a middle-of-the-road build-your-own burrito place in the Pittsburgh airport in the vein of Chipotle or Qdoba.  The Food: Imagine the same ingredients as Chipotle, except slightly lower quality ingredients, and with less seasoning/mixings. I found my burrito to be more expensive than Chipotle prices with smaller portions and less flavor.  The Service: This is the primary reason I gave Currito 2-stars. While the cashier and burrito-maker were both helpful and quick, their facial expressions and the way they talked to people gave me the impression that they were very sad about their jobs. To contrast, if you've ever been to Costco or In-N-Out, their employees always seem happy due to high pay and good management. When employees are unhappy, it makes me worried that they will cut corners with food preparation and also impacts how I feel about my patronage to a restaurant.  Conclusions: Currito ultimately is a below-average Chipotle clone that needs to treat its employees better."}
{"text":"Great food! Don't come here if you're pressed for time though. The girl behind the counter does the best she can with what she has to work with, but she needs more help with prep and someone on the register. She's a one man show so it takes longer than you'd expect from a fast food place."}
{"text":"The service here is outstanding, very friendly and efficient. I like that you aren't limited in your choices. There are different styles-Thai, Mexican, and you can mix and match to create your own flavor combination. It's even vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to slam restaurants. But, never again will I trust this place for my food.  I got a chorizo breakfast burrito and ended up with food poisoning.  Food poisoning is agonizing to deal with in the fist place, let alone while spending the day flying.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"The burritos were a little smaller than you might expect at Chipotle or Qdoba, but bigger than at Moe's. My burrito was delicious, however - surprisingly delicious. Just as each of the burrito chains has it's own distinct flavor, so does Currito. The jalapeno salsa is what I really think topped it off perfectly (instead of the pico - I'm not a pico fan). Wish we had one of these a little closer to the city!"}
{"text":"Located in the center square in the Pittsburgh airport is this little gem. You order the kind you want, burrito (large or small) or bowl, pick your protein and then the flavors. I had a Bangkok bowl with organic tofu. The bowl was a good size, had rice, cabbage, cucumber and sauce. The veggies were fresh, and the tofu was lightly seasoned. Topped with peanut sauce that wasn't too sweet. Very tasty!  The line moves quickly to get you on your way. They have some hot sauces (sriracha and Tabasco) where you pick up your food. I always like my food spicy so on went the sriracha to make it complete.  Great service, quick, and pretty healthy!"}
{"text":"Airport food isn't typically the best, but this was pretty good.  Everything was fresh and seasoned perfectly. The only thing I would have liked better is if the chicken was all white meat."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a bite to eat before seeing a movie ( Taken 2, which was very good by the way). Was'nt my first choice as the cafeteria we wanted to go to had been closed down. Ordered the classic which was steak or chicken with rice ,beans ,salsa and cheese. You would think a Mexican burrito would come with spanish rice and refried beans, but this one came with flavorless white rice and plain unseasoned pintos. The steak was good and tender but over all the burrito had no flavor and was served barely luke warm. Even the cup of hot sauce I got barely had any kick. Guacamole, chips, salsa and the like are all an extra charge, so we passed on those. The burritos were large and filling, but mine was pretty bland and the tortilla itself was kind of mushy and cold, and at almost $17 for 2 burritos and 2 teas, way over priced. Two visits in one for me, first and last."}
{"text":"The food is good but the guys making it are sloppy, disinterested and verging on gross."}
{"text":"Good...the food tasty but lack enough staff to make this a quick stop for a bite to eat.  Also the credit card machine was not functioning properly which increased the wait time."}
{"text":"OK,  Here I go again, not wanting to slam an establishment, but I just gotta put the hammer down on \"Currito - Burritos Without Borders\"  Service (scale 1 - 10; 10 being great):  0 - ya, off the chart BAD! Quality of Food  (same scale):  6  Here's the deal.  I fly out of PIT, typically in the early AM hours.  I'm hitting the terminal at around 0630.  Ya got a few places surrounding Currito's but what can I say, I'm a sucker for a breakfast burrito.   Not any more; not in PIT anyhow.  Next time I'm gonna look the other way and unfortunately, I'm gonna have to shuffle to the left and just hit up Mac's for breakfast.  Folks, Currito's service here in the morning hours (can't speak for later in the day) simply just SUCKS!  The guy (note singular) or guys (as in two employees max) simply do NOT want to be there and believe me, I feel as if I have to watch them closely because their attitudes are SOOO BAD, I feel they would spit in my food if I weren't looking.  Nasty, nasty people and this certainly is NO Reflection of the fine people that live in Pittsburgh.  I used to live in PIT years ago, and from those years, I have never run into the type of Currito employee(s) that are hired to serve the breakfast crowd.  The attitude and unfriendliness is SOOO BAD, I'm left to wonder how they can pass a security background test at an \"International\" Airport;  I guess maybe that has no bearing at all on security?  Please, avoid the absolute frustration from the hostile behavior of this place.  The management clearly needs to reevaluate the type of employee they want to meet the morning traveler out of this great city.  I have experienced wonderful service at the other eateries in the PIT terminal, so I do know you can find respectful employees who do enjoy serving the traveling public, within such an airport terminal.  With that said, that breakfast burrito...? Average at best.  Nothing to write home about.  Sorry \"Currito - Burritos Without Borders\" at Pittsburgh International:  Two Thumbs DOWN.    I've experienced your nasty attitude for at least 5 times now, and every single morning I've come thru, the last being this morning, 29 APR 14, it's been the same, regardless of who was so tortured to be there behind the counter!  My fellow crewmembers have been warned this morning and I will now proceed to tell the rest of my fellow airline crewmembers to steer clear of this place.  I don't like slamming a certain place and that is why I have held off until now.  This morning was simply the last straw.  AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!  A more appropriate name for this place?  \"Currito - Burritos With Attitude, Without Respect\"  Rant Out."}
{"text":"As an airport dining option that doesn't have sit-down service, if there's one thing you need to do well, it's make fast food.  As in I shouldn't have to wait more than 3 minutes fast.  They fail miserably at this.  I actually really like the food when they make it right, but they NEVER get it right.  I have never had the same person make me anything.  The line folks look back over their shoulder at the menu and try to build from that.  There are maybe 10 options...how are these not memorized??  That being said, if you have time, and can stifle your piss-poor-service-frustrations, the food's good and very fresh.  I always get the Mediterranean bowl.  It's always tasty.  If you're in a hurry, or in a bad mood, don't go here, because you'll walk away angry."}
{"text":"Currito is a passable food option for an airport.  There really aren't very many options.  The chicken was dark meat and kinda fatty, which puts this place on par with Chipotle.  In fact, it is almost the exact same thing.  I only tried the salad with no cheese and it wasn't too bad other than the poor quality meat.  The lettuce, corn salsa and tomato salsa were all fresh, but the guacamole was clearly made hours in advance, looking its color and tasting kind of drab.  It was very efficient though to grab a bite right before a flight."}
{"text":"Best airport quick burrito I've ever had. I think I'd order the tikka tofu burrito again even outside an airport"}
{"text":"I might have been here on a bad day but what is a burrito place without GUAC??? No guac, hot bottled water, and two pimply girls up front that were so incompetent and rude! I'm vegan so asked for tofu as my protein. She made such a show placing the tofu in my bowl that I figured she probably never sees it (might be decades old) so I threw mine out. The beans were so ridiculously salty that I chugged a whole bottle of water after the bowl. Bad experience, bad food."}
{"text":"This was the worst burrito I have Ever eaten. I was expecting Qdoba/Chipotle quality and was horribly disappointed. I took it on the plane with me, and choked down half because it was an 8 hour flight and it was that or pretzels. I ordered a classic build your own: flour tortilla, pinto beans, cilantro rice, pico de gallo, hot sauce, cheese, sour cream, guacamole. For almost $9, it was small. The rice tasted like artificial lemon flavor and it was overpowering. Couldn't taste the hot sauce, in fact no other flavors stood out."}
{"text":"It was nice to see this place at Northlake - like a breath of fresh air from all the Chipotles and Moe's around Charlotte.  The menu selection provides some interesting combinations.  I tried the Summer style burrito that included mango slices and avocado.  Pretty refreshing.  The bag'o chips provided were a bit stale, but the fresh chopped \"Salsa\" was neat and rustic.  A bit over priced for a moderately sized burrito and stale chips."}
