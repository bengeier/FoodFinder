{"text":"It was my first time eating here, after driving by it so many times. The food was great and AMAZING service from Charity!!! Well definitely be back....she was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I got a to go order for a large office group. They were cognizant of all of our \"special\" orders due to health reasons and everything tasted great. They even put names on for us! I would definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Today I stopped by this newly opened taco place because I like supporting local businesses and I like tacos. I felt like having some fish and shrimp tacos,  so that is what I ordered.  First,  my shrimp taco was delicious! It was served exactly how is was stated on the menu, \"shrimp sautéed in a guajillo sauce on a bed of red Mexican rice.\" This shrimp taco was delicious, but I felt it could have been better if there was some kind of greens like a slaw or chunky salsa to add some freshness to it and take it over the top.  Second, the fish taco was not served how it was stated on the menu.  . . \"Beer battered tilapia on a bed of cabbage topped with Baja sauce and mango salsa.\" When I received my fish taco it was NOT beer batter,  more like steamed tilapia,  and it did NOT have the Baja sauce. Also, the mango salsa tasted more like pineapple salsa.  If the fish taco was served like it was stated on the menu, then it would have been delicious as the shrimp taco instead it was underwhelming. For what I was served,  I felt that I was overcharged especially since the menu was misleading.   Overall this place has a nice dining area with a bar where you can sit at and some flat screen TV's."}
{"text":"Wow what a great place for street tacos, chips and salsa and a cold beer. Full bar. Attentive staff, delicious food. A must try. BEST SALSA IN THE VALLEY - homemade ... Support local and independent."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot.

Tacos are on point, take this from a guy who has eaten homemade tacos since I could chew solid food.  They have a great weekend brunch special that includes one of the best micheladas I have ever drank."}
{"text":"Being from California where we know a thing or two about Mexican food, this place was awesome.  Prompt service, thanks Brittney.  We had the tres tacos combo, al pastor was excellent, my favorite and I'm always looking for a great pastor.  The fish taco was excellent also with the mango sauce on top.  We ordered the big guacamole which was very flavorful with just the right amount of spice.  The salsa for the chips was some of the best I've had outside of Cali.  We went on a Friday around 2:30 and it was happy hour time.....whaaaaat??? We'll definitely be back to enjoy the daily specials and all the TVs to watch my sports!! Thanks again Brittney !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Sharky's for their grand opening on May 5th. I was pretty excited for the opening considering they are only about a 3 minute drive from our home. Prior to the opening I had been checking out there Facebook page where they had stated there would be food and drink specials all night. We got to Sharky's and opted to sit outside on the patio which was very nice. Our waiter came out immediately and asked us for our drink orders, this is where it starts to go downhill. I asked about the advertised food and drink specials and I kid you not her response was, \"Oh we don't have any food and drink specials, here at Sharky;s we say our prices are so good all the time so we don't offer any specials.\" Huh? Half of the reason why we came in was because of all the advertised food and drink specials for the opening. I found it comical that they thought their prices were that good that they didn't need to have specials because their food and drinks were way overpriced. Moving on, we ordered two house margaritas to drink and the guacamole to start with. The guacamole was made tableside and we both really enjoyed it. Something I did notice though was that all the other tables were given free chips and salsa and we were not given any. The margaritas we were served were horrible. My husband and I are not picky when it comes to food and drinks, but we were drinking them and seriously questioning if the bartender left the alcohol out of them, they tasted that bad. Because we were paying $9 for a house margarita we decided to say something. Our waiter as kind and did bring out a shot for each of us to put into the margarita and that made it exceptionally better. We ordered a burrito and a couple of tacos. We both thought the food was good, but not worth the price. Overall we did not have a great experience there. I do understand it was their first night open but the thing that left the worst taste in my mouth was the advertised food and drink specials and then upon arriving there being told they have none because their regular prices are \"so good\" all the time. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat food because the service was horrible and took about 20-25 mins to just order drinks and another just to get chips and salsa which was horrible. Would never go back or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. Service is awful awful awful AWFUL. 45 min for chicken nuggets and fries. Don't know their beers and whether they have it available or not... al pastor tastes like beef and nothing like the menu states. Get some more intelligent people to run your restaurant if you want to survive."}
{"text":"The service here was completely awful. We waited nearly 15 minutes before we were even greeted by a waitress and then another 10 minutes before we got waters. Once they did finally take our order, the food was extremely mediocre. Our waitress was also rude and seemed distracted. The staff was not very attentive to anyone aside from the people at the bar. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"After seeing many ads for this place on Facebook, I decided to check it out. Came in on a Saturday morning about 11am. As others have said, definitely not the best location or decorations. However, this place blew me away with the food and drink.

Let's start with the food:

Great Mexican focused menu with minimal options for those looking for something different. Ordered the queso fundido which was just ok. The dish was good but the chips seemed like they weren't fresh. We also ordered the shrimp cocktail which was amazing!!! It was almost entirely shrimp and a good enough size to justify the price. Good flavor as well. For the main dish I ordered the menudo since I was a little hungover. The bowl was much larger than I öexpected and it had a good ratio of meat, hominy, and juice. It came with onions, cilantro, extra chili flakes, and lime on the side. Fantastic deal compared to other places that serve menudo in Phoenix.

As for drinks, we sat at the bar and shared a bucket of coronas. Again, great deal on buckets and very comparable to other bars in the area. They also have domestic buckets for a few dollars less. Draft beer is a little limited, but it's definitely a tequila bar. Wide variety of premium tequila and variations on margaritas. Although happy hour is only Monday through Friday, we did notice that it seemed like they have some good deals on beer, wine, and wells during the week as well.

Lastly, the service. I can see why people might have a problem with the service, but we avoided this by sitting at the bar and chatting with the bartender who took very good care of us. He offered to change the channel on the gigantic TV sitting at the bar, brought all of our food and drink in a timely manner and even put the volume up a little for us when we played music on their jukebox. I felt bad for him because it seemed like it was just him and the one cook working. He was greeting the customers, taking orders, making drinks, running food, bussing tables, and cleaning. Definitely a hard working staff who might just need a little extra help to give perfect service. I was more than happy to tip over 20% for the service we got.

In sum, the experience I had on my first visit was good enough to make me come back the very next day. Same great food, great service. Don't let the location or looks of the restaurant fool you, it's worth your time and money to visit and try for yourself."}
{"text":"We had the Shark burrito, the shrimp fajitas, and a Carne Asada quesadilla. All fantastic. This will become a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"My friend was their and had the money to give to me so we could RSVP a table for 3, had I know we had to pay in advanced, it would of been no problem.  Your server  told me that you don't have to pay in advance. I doubled checked with your server 3 times  and \"claimed\" he checked with the manager just to make sure, which I saw him do. Later, when my friend leaves, he tells me I have to pay in advance. I have been wanting to watch this fight for a long time.  I mean we were gonna order so much beer and food that you would make triple that. Its up to you. I made a special mission to drive all the way over their to verify this."}
{"text":"This place has pretty descent food. The service is not very good. They take a long time to service tables i.e drink refills and concerns. I waited 20 mins for my check during that time I waited with an empty drink and my plates were stacked. If you are in a hurry you should probably pic a different place. I was here over and hour, and I was trying to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I called as this is a neighborhood bar restaurant and twice I called for price info and take out order only to be answered by RUDE waitress / bartender.  There is NO CUSTOMER service here.  I'll take my business to a big chain place and give them my money.  I don't see this place staying open long with rude staff like I have experienced"}
{"text":"We went to the newer Mesa location and I was excited to try it as I had heard good things.  What a disappointment!  The venue was nice and clean and the service was good, but the food was an utter disappointment.  I ordered the carne asada street tacos; but what I received was unseasoned ground beef tacos.  I ate one of the three I ordered and no more.  My husband ordered two fish regular tacos and was equally unimpressed.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Okay so in all fairness my first experience here was terrible. I even posted a 1 star review about. The short version is we were sat then ignored for 15 minutes before we got up and walked out. 

That should have been the end of the story but we came back a month later and had a better experience. We came back again last week and Dante the bartender made sure we had a blast. Everyone was laughing and having a great time. Stayed longer than planned and ended up in an Uber. Not bad for a neighborhood bar. 

And we are back yet again for some dinner and a few drinks. I got to say I'm glad we have the place another chance. Good food. Nicely priced drinks. And Wednesday night DILLY DILLY $1 beers!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I had ever been to Sharky's. I, unfortunately, would not recommend it, unless you're going there to watch sports on the many tv's they have. The food was not that good and it was one of the worst house margarita's for happy hour that I've ever had. Sad to say, but the BEST thing about this restaurant was our server, Isabel, and the really cute Shark Salt & Pepper holders!! :)"}
{"text":"The service was fine, food was quick. I tried a few tacos. The fish taco was just ok. The carne asada taco was really good. The pastor taco was inedible. I'd come back again to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Upon entering our first impression was that the place was a little empty but it was mid day on new years eve.  We came here becasue of proximity to our new apartment.  We met the owner who was very kind and accommodating to us and our two young sons. The food came out fast which was nice, although the street tacos were a little lacking.  The enchiladas were a bit more like a Mexican pizza than enchiladas.  The food was good, the draft beer was nice a cold and we will for sure be coming back here."}
{"text":"The food tasted fine, but the regular size tacos are practically street tacos, for the amount of meat you get vs the price. They need to load up the tacos with more meat, if they're going to charge $3.25 or $3.50, depending on the meat you choose. I'll check back in a month, to see if this has changed."}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix for about a year (moved from Texas), and have not been satisfied with the Mexican seafood options...until I found Sharky's! 

Not only was the wait staff (can't remember her name, but she's awesome!) friendly, accommodating, and knowledgeable, the food itself was REALLY good!!

Things I liked most:

-The music: very authentically Mexican feel without feeling unapproachable

-Shrimp ceviche: Perfect blend of lemon and spice

-Fish tacos: The ONLY place I've found that does grilled fish as opposed to battered, and served beautifully blackened spices.

-Traditional Michilada: Beer, fresh squeezed lime juice, with a great Chamoy rim!

-Outdoor patio: I can eat AND smoke! Yay!

-The wait staff: She was super friendly, and helpful!"}
{"text":"Love it this place is fairly new and I was excited to see they have tons of good drinks and food to match!"}
{"text":"I had street tacos and they were just okay. I eat tacos all the time so these ones didn't have anything special about them (not to be rude). If I had to pick I'd say I enjoyed the barbacoa the most . I usually love Al Pastor but the flavor and texture was unbearable to me so I gave it to my boyfriend. While our server was very nice and friendly, she was super inattentive. It seemed like she was the only one there running the bar and serving which I understand but we were in kind of a rush.. and we also saw two groups come in and then eventually leave because it took too long for them to be acknowledged. We were seated right away and got our drink orders in.. but after that it took twenty minutes just for her to come back and take our order. Another thirty to bring it out .. and another thirty to forty five minutes to bring the check. I did give a couple stars because the tacos were 99cents when we went in and that's a good deal for a group ."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quality and quantity. I don't mind spending money on food, but I mind spending money on overpriced underwhelming food. The food is just not good, under-seasoned, and the meat is NOT quality meat. I had the carne asada burrito, and honestly, filibertos is 100 times better, and cheaper. There are too many good Mexican places around, if this place wants to survive they better get a new chef and lower their prices."}
{"text":"Restaurant was about half full, but it took a while to be greeted and have a drink order taken. Ten minutes went by before a manager checked on my boyfriend & I because he noticed we had been sitting, drinkless, for a bit. He brought us waters and went to hover around the bartender. A short while later the drinks came out. The waitress came back to take our order, super apologetic, and offered us a free dessert at the end of the meal. 

We ordered queso as an appetizer and two of each kind of taco for Taco Tuesday ($1.50 each).  The queso never arrived at the table, so we just moved onto the tacos. None of the five protein choices stood out in particular. Not impressed by the food.

The margaritas were expensive, around $15 bucks, and they didn't really seem to even be the right color for what we had ordered. They tasted super sugary and not like a \"top shelf\" drink. 

Won't be back... on to the next Taco Tuesday adventure."}
{"text":"Came in with 4 people at 1pm on a Saturday. Literally the ONLY people in the restaurant. I don't think any of the employees are trained. This is a long review but the food could not have been more incorrect compared to the descriptions on the menu. 

We started with \"table side\" guacamole that came out brown from the back and was not made at the table. 

We all ordered regular tacos, 2-3 each. None of them came out right. 

Fish taco described as- beer battered fish on a bed of cabbage topped with Baja sauce and mango salsa.

Fish taco came out as grilled fish, on lettuce no sauce and mango salsa. 

Tinga Taco described as- shredded chicken breast braised in chipotle sauce, stuffed in a crispy corn tortilla and topped with cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, tomatoes and crema. 

Came out as- shredded chicken on a soft corn tortilla, onions and cheese.  
- when we asked for crema to add ourself, they charged us for it. 

Tacos Al Pastor described as- thinly sliced pork marinated in adobo sauce mixed with grilled pineapple, cilantro & onions. 

Came out as- ground pork with cilantro and onions. 

When we looked at our plates some of the tacos were regular size and some were clearly street tacos. We told them the problem and they responded that they would \"have to take back the plates, and it would take a long time to make new tacos\" essentially refusing to make the order right. I pointed out that there was no pineapple on the Al Pastor and her first response was \"it never comes with pineapple\". After checking the menu she came out with three sides of fresh (not grilled) pineapple. 

At the end of our meal we calmly tried to point out how wrong off the food was compared to the descriptions on the menu. The waitress clearly didn't care but said she would \"make it right\" for us. When she came with the new bill she had put an 8% discount on the guacamole and made no other adjustments. 

Needless to say we will never go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Super close, good pricing on specials every night and lots of tvs to catch a game. We will definitely come here often."}
{"text":"The Sharkbite Margarita was tasty: tangy, yet mellow. I had the Carne Asada Enchiladas. The meat and green sauce were good, but I wouldn't describe them as enchiladas. They were like a stripped down version of their tacos (just meat and a tiny bit of cheese), except the cheese was melted. 

Here's the thing: Dinner was still good! Normally, the not-really enchiladas would have been disappointing because I like enchiladas (not naked tacos); but the meat and side items were good enough to leave me happy. The Margarita probably didn't hurt. Haha

The beans on the side were just right: still whole beans, not overcooked to mush. The Spanish rice wasn't soaked in lard, either; so I enjoyed that, too.

My boyfriend enjoyed his El Pastor, Carne Asada and Tinga tacos plate. His Horchata tasted watery, or like maybe they used skim milk?

Food pices are reasonable. The large margarita was $12. Their website says they have happy hour \"everyday from 3pm-7pm\"; yet, we were told there was no happy hour on the weekends.

Despite the few areas of opportunity, we enjoyed Sharky's and would go back."}
{"text":"Tacos are good. I had barbacoa and carne asada. Rice and beans are OK. Skip the rice and beans and just order 3 or 4 tacos instead. Could use more salsa with the chips. Decor is very nice. All in all it's a nice little spot which this neighborhood is in desperate need of and I'm looking forward to going back and trying some other tacos."}
{"text":"The best of the best for Mexican foods and bars in Tempe, Arizona. I was here just a few timers, but I liked a lot and their drinks were nicely, too! I definitely will be back here for more foods and drinks, and special happy hour! I am highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food, cold beer, great micheladas! Oscar the bartender was great. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Been there twice the day time bartender/server was excellent very engaged in me and my associates. Food came out faster then expected. The barbacore taco was legit. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Tacos are barely mediocre. If you want something that is flavorless and covered in guacamole, this is the place for you. Rice is bland and beans are just ok. Also, it's super expensive. 3 Taco plate is $13, fish taco is $3 and individual tacos are $2. Save your time and money!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and I thought  this place was busier. There were 3 people at the bar and my friend and I. Our waitress (Sherry?) was fast and friendly but maybe it was because the place was so empty she was a little loud with her side conversation. It's not that I don't expect employees to talk, it's perfectly fine but we were sitting on the opposite wall and we could hear her full side discussion, more so than I could probably hear my friends across from me. But her fast and friendly service towards us was good. My margarita was good, a normal large lime margarita and it was $6 , good for the price! (All other margaritas run for about $10+ but house margaritas are $6 on Mondays.) Chips and salsa were good, especially the salsa. It actually had a punch and wasn't like other restaurant's sorry excuse of salsa. I ordered the chilaquiles and presentation was really good but there was no spiciness. I get not a lot of people like the level of spiciness I do but it's always good to carry something that'll make you sweat. I would probably come back but would maybe try something a little different and I'll definitely try one of the specialty drinks!"}
{"text":"I have had my share of Mexican food and sad to say most of it here in Tempe is mediocre. However, I can't say that about Sharkey's. I brought a friend and we tried all the Tacos. They were spectacular. The barbacoa is nice and spicy and easily must have been marinated all night. It was tender and delicious. The fish taco had a lightly grilled tilapia fillet with this bright mango salsa that just burst of incredible flavors.  The winner for me was the Carne Asada with the big chunky guacamole. The pork was juicy and soaked into the avocado. It was so luscious that my tongue danced. They serve lime tortilla chips with a medium spicy salsa and a guacasalsa that was killer good. It is a little pricey for the Tacos but for the flavor and great customer service it's totally worth it. I'm coming back for thirds fourths and fifths. Lol."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. I went there in a group with my boyfriend, our two roommates, their newborn son, and our friend last Tuesday and I'm coming back today with my good friend for more dollar tacos! The salsa was amazing, not too hot not too mild, we were never forgotten about, our orders were taken promptly, and we were seated immediately! I asked for a lot of limes because I have a bit of an obsession and believe you me, I was given a LOT of LIMES! Our server had the best attitude and though there was a ladybug in one of my boyfriend's tacos, all four were replaced and his whole meal was free because of it. It was definitely a happy experience and I've been anxiously awaiting \"Taco Day!!\""}
{"text":"Don't go here for taco Tuesday worse service , sat down didn't even get greeted or a simple hello , then took forever to get are menus plus when she brought the menus she didn't even ask for our drinks so then we waited for the waitress to come back for like another 10 minutes she took our drink order and didn't bother to ask us if we were ready to Order food as well , THEN we get the nasty ass no syrup having cokes that we order at that point were pissed off so we get up and leave leave the money for the drinks atleast then the manager who is there drinking and eating comes out to ask us why we're leaving my mom explained to him and he didn't even offer to give us our money back or anything just says come back we will get better !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for taco Tuesday's, I love a good margarita and for 5$ that's a price you can't beat! The service could use some work as it's pretty slow but the street tacos are to die for, I usually get the carnitas and barbacoa. But whenever I go I ask for Alex to take care of me and he never leaves my drink empty."}
{"text":"Short and to the point..the tacos taste great but are literally \"one bite\" tacos. I've been to mexico and had authentic street tacos and they were most definitely larger than these. It was truly disappointing that this place doesn't offer a happy hour as confirmed by my waitress. Considering the location of the business, happy hour is definitely in demand. For taco Tuesday they offer \"a\" beer at a discount cost. The margaritas were also on the higher end I believe starting at $9.00 up to about $14.00. Overall the food tasted good and the salsa was amazing but I'm truly disappointed in the lack of \"happy hour\" and drink specials. I find it ironic the business is listed on here as having \"daily\" happy hour, I guess Tuesday wasn't one of the days. The atmosphere was inviting and the place was booming. I won't be in a rush to come back, I would rather go to Bogey's for their taco Tuesday offering full size tacos and AMAZING drink specials."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 4 star was really busy but my waitress Sarah was really attentive even tho it was full she was the only one that was paying attention to everyone who came in and trying to help every table the other guy working as waitress/bartender seem like he was putting alot of work on my waitress shoulder i didnt see him helping  much. Sarah was all over the place trying to make everyone fell welcome. Food was great definitely coming back for tacos 
Next time i come ima make sure my waitress is sarah love her service. 
Also they should definitely get a New manager didnt even see her once!!  Oh and a new waitress/bartender!"}
{"text":"I love taco Tuesdays , the food was great, Tasha my server was awesome, very professional."}
{"text":"First : try the street tacos. I had the barbacoa, Carne Asada and chicken tinga and all were amazing. You know how Carne Asada is usually full of grissle and fat? Not here. Every chew was amazing. I was sad that it was over. I also got the full size fish and surf and turf (it's not on the menu but ask for it) tacos. I didn't love the mango salsa on the fish but the actual tacos were freaking amazing. I came in here hungry and am so satisfied that it hurts. I am already messaging friends to bail from other taco places for taco Tuesdays, this is hands down my new favorite stop. The meat was unbelievable and so tasty. 

Special note: CLEANLINESS. The place is spotless, but every single time the bartender even touched a dirty cup she would stop and scrub her hands before mixing the next drink or even handing out a plate. I can't tell you how much this means to me. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday afternoon... The server said they were still in their \"soft opening\". The service itself was great....the food was way overpriced for the quality and quantity.....the steak on the steak tacos tasted no different than Taco Bell...I don't think they're going to make it unless they tweak their concept a bit....that space is prime neighborhood bar/restaurant space...overpriced mediocre fair won't keep them in business....imo..."}
{"text":"I came here to work on a promotion for micheladas with Clamato , there were only two guys working here (Oscar and Pedro) they were very nice , the service was fast, tasty and affordable . Everything looks pretty clean , there's a music box (I really don't know how this is called lol) but you can play any song you want .. There are bunch of tvs, a perfect place to come for the football season . 
Taco Tuesday is awesome !
Apparently they have a dj coming out , but I wasn't really sure on the days . 
I highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"I was big at 5-Star months ago but NOW you have earned my 1-Star! Lack of customer service is a start. Being charged for chips and salsa when I've never been charged in a Tuesday. You get only enough salsa for 8 chips. You have to twice a services arm to get napkins and stuff. I doubt the owners will ever ask to talk with me. Been in this restaurant business way to long as a consultant and I'll be thinking twice about recommending this to others! Sad!"}
{"text":"First time here. Very nice and clean. Nice colors on Wall and decor. Blue led lights around bar top. Juke box and music. TV around the restaurant. Oscar was very nice and helpful and gave us more info on upcoming events. They have 99cenylt tacos taco tuesday, $1 budlights on Wednesdays. Karaoke on Thursdays. They might have a DJ on Fridays Girls night out coming soon. Had a good bloody mary and it was only $4 bucks. Had the shrimp and it was delicious. It had great flavors and healthy too. I also had street tacos, alpastor and Barbacoa and they were ok. Had the fish taco and was good. I will definitely come back to try the ceviche."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I went here for the first time on taco Tuesday. We were a bit confused at first, because we didn't know if we had to just walk in and sit anywhere or had to wait to be seated. But finally we were greeted, and sat at a booth. We started off with the Tableside Guacamole. I highly recommend this if you like to start off with chips & guac. Also the cool thing about this was that they give you the mashed avocados in a bowl, and anything you need to make guacamole. It's like a do it yourself if that makes sense. I thought this was pretty cool, because you can add just the right amount of anything you want. Like cilantro, tomatoes, onion, lime, jalapeños, etc. Now for our main event my girlfriend ordered the carne asada torta which came with a side of fries, I ordered the carne asada quesadilla, and we both ordered a side of tacos. So 2 carne asada & 2 al pastor tacos. Everything we ordered was great. So for our first visit everything went well, we got all our food under 15 min, and great customer service. The only downside was that it was a bit humid, and kind of loud, which made it hard to converse. But besides that we were satisfied with our visit, and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service I have ever had, being a server I tend to judge a little more than most but we came in the restaurant, no one greeted us, we sat there while the servers sat on their phones they didn't bring us menus. We ordered our food and she didn't write it down I thought maybe she remembered it, our food came out wrong. I order a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with green chili. What I got was a tortilla with melted cheese rolled up with green chili sauce poured over it. If I could give this place 0 stars I would, I would NEVER send anyone to this establishment it's so bad I had to write a review like this do not eat here."}
{"text":"Idk where all these people who say this is the best Mexican food in town are from but this place sucks sauce was from a can and no rice and beans with plate I don't think so won't be back"}
{"text":"dont do it. i love tacos and if you do to then go somewhere else. horchata was warm?? carne was bland, salsa was mild as ketchup, pastor was bland, the mf bill was sooooo high"}
{"text":"I came here tonight to watch the fight with my friend and when we arrived it was packed as expected so we took a seat on the patio. When the one waitress came out (kind of heavier set with very short dark brown hair) she was assisting everyone around us. By the time she came out the second time, we were ready to order and she walked right past us so I said \"excuse me, can we order from you?\" To which she replied \"I'll have to send your server out.\" Coming from the service industry myself, I was put back by this because if someone who wasn't in my section asked to order from me, I would at least take the order and relay it to the server it belonged to to provide guest service. Which mind you, she was the only server I had seen on the patio. It took 20 minutes for another waitress to come out and she walked past us as well. Again I asked \"excuse me can we order from you?\" She replied with  \"ummmmmm I guess I have time my other tables seem to be ok.\" We placed our order and drinks came out quick, but when the food came out it was dry and unappetizing. I was disappointed that we paid $20 each just to get in to watch the fight on top of feeling like an inconvenience  to the wait staff. Also had to chase waitress down to get my credit card back. Definitely won't be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Over priced, not so great service, bad food. Carne Asada was boiled and so salty that no matter how much sour cream, guacamole, cheese etc I piled on, all I could taste was salt. Really good chips and salsa though."}
{"text":"This place gave my wife and I the worst customer service we've ever experienced thus far. We arrived and waited thirty minutes just so our drink order could be taken. I literally had to find someone to take our drinks to begin with. No one there introduced themselves and they made taking our order (when they finally did it) seem like a burden. I'm more than positive my wife and I weren't wearing  invisibility cloaks although they made us feel like we were. If you value customer service like we do and don't want to wait an hour for $1 tacos please do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. If you like playing hide and seek with servers or spot the employee you might enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a to-go order for Taco Tuesday. I was greeted upon entering, staff was polite and helpful, I have no complaints about service or time to make food. Brought the tacos back to work and I was happy and pleased with the tacos. I most likely will be adding Sharky's into our lunch rotation. If I'm ever in the area for leisure I may just stop by to dine in."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever!!! They are way over priced and I'm not even joking 3 taco salads were served with cabbage instead of lettuce. When we told them of the error she said they ran out of lettuce. Then ordered a Caesar salad and it came with head lettuce!!! So they weren't out of lettuce. They poppers are Costco brand and deep baked under cooked and gross! BAJA JOES is by far superior. $10.99 for real jalapeño poppers wrapped in real bacon and stuffed with shrimp. Don't ever eat AT sharky's on university if you can avoid the dissatisfaction.  They didn't even deserve the one star I gave them."}
{"text":"Food sucked. They got our orders wrong then acted annoyed when we asked for them to be corrected. Everyones food came out at different times. The service was very slow. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wont be back. The food and the service sucked. Our orders were wrong. Everything came out at different times."}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is for the .99 tacos on Tuesdays but the service is HORRIBLE. Everytime I go there are about 4 servers and 10 tables and the servers are always running around but i don't know to what because no one around is getting service and they ignore you as they are running around. It also takes about 20 min to get your water filled!! I have never seen slower/ worse service then the one here."}
{"text":"The best tacos I've had in years!! BOH is on point!! Try it... be like NiKE and just do IT!"}
{"text":"Great ambience , beautiful  decor , and the food is muy bueno !!! Would definitely recommend Sharkys for the food , watching sports and a good watering hole"}
{"text":"Only ate here once. The food and drinks were great bujt the service was pretty slow even though it was only like 5 people in there. I still liked it."}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious and customer service was great!  We will definitely be back again.  They have a good variety of street tacos.  They are reasonably priced everyday and even better in Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for Taco Tuesday and tried 4 different types of tacos, except the chicken, because it seemed the plainest. They were all fantastic! I'm not a drinker, but they had good deals on Corona and Bud light for Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Tacos are also on sale when it's a game night. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I hate doing these reviews when I am negative but I feel the owner needs to know the representation his/her staff is giving. I'm in the industry and would want to know how my staff represents the experience of my bar. 

First we walk in to the hostess sitting in the waiting area on her phone. Classic millenial. I'm a mom of teens so maybe it doesn't bug me as much. We proceed to the bar. We sit at a horseshoe shape bar with 3 customers bellied up. Not busy at all. Literally sit for a few as she's inches away from us. About 3 mins in to us sitting  (which in customer time feels like 20 min) Alyssa  asks what we want to drink. We order and my husband selection of beer is not pouring. Instead of checking if the keg needed to ve changed or maybe adjusted she looks at my husband in a very monotone tone. \"We are out, want something else?\"  So we finally get a menu and she asks what I want. I order. She walks away without asking my hubby if he's hungry. She proceeded to talk to, I'm assuming a regular, my husband flags her down and asks if he can order. She puts in his order and seconds later my meal comes out. I asked for pico on the side. Nope i get pico on my meal. She proceeds to ask if I want them to take it off. I said yes please I'm not a huge fan of onions. I get my plate back with more guac to hide the pico still on my plate. Whatever I'll pick around it at this point. Hubbys shrimp tacos were good. Awful service and ok food. Super disappointed. I always want local shops to thrive. Good luck Sharkys. We won't be back and I won't recommend ever."}
{"text":"I loved it here. Came for Taco Tuesday and their special dollar tacos! Greeted automatically on arrival. Served chips and salsa while I waited for my tacos. Salsa was sooo delicious. Nothing like the store ones or other Mexican restaurants. Spices was great n chips were still hot. The tacos are amazing! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE OVER FILIBERTOS ANYDAY! Next time gonna get me a margarita or corona lol I am happy I finally checked it out. Well worth it"}
{"text":"First this place was so hot!! I couldn't even have fun and chill. It was St. Patricks Day so i thought it would be a fun happy hour. Nope, I was really disappointed. The drinks are over priced and the service is just okay. My card was misplaced for 5 minutes. The bartender told me she handed it back to me. I would know if my card was given back to me especially if it was on top of the receipt. I was made to feel really uncomfortable because I was told that I had misplaced my own card. The card was finally located in the bartenders cup which holds all of the receipts and cards. So it wasn't my fault.  Not sure if I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and very friendly server. A bit unorganized but no huge delays.  Barbacoa taco was very good but I'm afraid the Tinga taco may not have been well-cooked."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The interior has been completely remodeled. They have plans for misters and awnings for the patio area. Great prices with large portions of food. There are large flat screens for all the games. Loved the nachos"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 0, I would. They literally would not serve me. I checked it out because it is right around the corner from my house. 10 minutes of waiting and no waitress. Then, she comes out and says sorry last call was at 11:00... I said well the door says midnight and it's 10:40 right now. She said sorry. So I left. I won't ever go back there again. Wow!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant and staff. They were the MOST accommodating restaurant I have had the pleasure of visiting. We were in town for a bjj tournament so we made arrangements for our team and another team to meet up after. They went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. The food was amazing the drinks were incredible. We will be back every time we are in town! I can not recommend sharkys enough!!!"}
{"text":"Aside from this place being absolutely filthy, there's a serious lack of customer service.  Not sure if we were suppose to be seated or seat ourselves although  theres a server stand yet nobody greeted us. We took a seat,  and again ignored.  Finally when someone came to get a drink order,  my iced tea literally had 3 ice cubes.  Meanwhile,  I'm again waiting for someone to take an order.  I called someone over who says \"I'm kinda the manager\". Were were told we could ask for chips and salsa. Im just done,  you lost customers who are taco fanatics."}
{"text":"I am only giving three stars because our needs were catered much better than the others within the restaurant. 

We arrived before a few of the other customers within the facility but it took quite a while for our server to come to our table. However, the hostess that was both seating people and helping clean off tables stopped by to get our drinks and take our order. 

I did notice our server was going to individual tables and literally running back to the server station to grab one item and return frantically - she did this the entire time. The way I perceived this was she had no common sense to make a round through her section and retrieve orders and ask individuals if they needed anything else. Almost all the servers were not utilizing their time wisely and they seemed somewhat of a disorganized team. 

We noticed a couple walked out and another guy at a different table was complaining about how terrible things were going. I ordered four tacos and I only received three but this was okay as long as we weren't being charged.
Long story short, management needs to train these individuals a little more or they'll be running the business into the ground because If I were those people coming in and leaving I probably wouldn't be coming back after encountering such chaos. 

The food was actually pretty good too. #tacotuesday"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waitress seemed like she had no idea what she was doing. Tried to order three different types of beers and they were out of all three. Horrible experience all around"}
{"text":"I give it two stars only because the service was awesome! But a few hours after my boyfriend ate a surf and turf taco and a fish taco...it came back for him like Montezuma's revenge. Not sure how long the fish was sitting, but stay away from it! Good doesn't always mean fresh."}
{"text":"Ok so honest review here I've been here three times so far. Two of them on taco Tuesday. Each time the food has been great and that's what's earned them the three stars. The staff although friendly isn't up to par. Not sure if it's management however today I saw the worst I've seen in a restaurant. Upon arriving as usual it seemed busy. We had a party of four we sat ourselves. The waitress came and checked on us after 20 minutes of us hanging out and got us menus. She took off quickly and it became obvious she was the only waitress working. You would think on a busy night like taco Tuesday where they offer 99 cent tacos and 3$ coronas they'd fully staff expecting a full house of taco loving thrifty customers coming in for this deal. Having said that we waited and finally she came and asked for drink orders. We ordered 4 comes and one corona. She took off with that before we could say we were ready to order food as well. 

In the meantime there was a Clamato group of girls promoting their Michelada drink and came over to let us know and give us a free sample which was interesting and nice to see. 

We waited another 20 minutes and she came and took our food order after giving us chips and salsa. 

There was a large party of ten next to us who seemed frustrated. At the same time the manager for the Clamato group came around and Said free Clamato drinks for anyone who ordered them. I jumped at the idea and looked For our waitress. She eventually came and checked on us we told her we needed refills and I told her about the Clamato. She said ok and only took one glass to refill. Which left me confused. She clearly was doing her best but seemed stressed. 

At that moment the group of ten got up and left the lady said we've been waiting for our food for an hour. Saying it to the Clamato manager and  him going I'm not the manager. The manager of the restaurant immediately came over but they had already left. They were pretty upset. 

Service here is usually slow and we don't care because we socialize anyway however this time around it seemed pretty bad. 

We finally got our food. And it was wrong. And still no corona we had ordered. The waitress was all over the place. Once we got our food we never saw her again. 

The Clamato girls became waitresses and we're taking orders and assisting. Which is pretty sad. Another group left and we were still waiting on our refills. End of our meal the Clamato girl came and gave me a free Clamato drink for the wait and refilled our cokes. At this point we just wanted to get out. 

We tried tipping her but she wouldn't take it

We paid and left. 


Honestly I think this restaurants management should get it together and have more hands on deck for this place the girl was clearly frazzled and they should focus on customer service. That's what makes or breaks a place. The food can only save this place for so long. 

Ultimately good food but please work on time management and customer service."}
{"text":"Went here for tacos with my fiancé and our moms. The service was horrible. My water was never filled and the waitress was not attentive. The food was okay at best. We ordered chips and salsa and the chips were straight out of a bag. No salt, and not warm and no refill."}
{"text":"Horrible, just horrible service. I gave the business 3 chances over a year to see if the service would get better. The food isn't good either. Just horrible."}
{"text":"I have given one star because not giving one was not an option.  I wish I could have given a rating on the food however I didn't get that far.  The restaurant is clean which is a plus.  However the service was less than desired.  I first walked in and the bartender said she would be right with me so I sat at the bar awaiting her to take my order.  In the meantime there was another lady who walked in maybe a minute after me whom I believe is a regular since the bartender greeted her by name.  The lady sat next to me and a few minutes later the bartender walked up to her to take her order not acknowledging that I was sitting directly next to the lady nor that I had arrived first.  I sat a second to see if she would recover by asking for my order as well.  She did not! She walked away and begin helping the lady who came in after me,  I politely got my purse, got up and walked out.  I guess my business was not wanted.  I'm not interested in paying for food and receiving rude service. I hope this helps someone else."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, full bar, friendly service...I'd definitely come again. The ambience is not fabulous, but it's kind of a fun hole-in-the-wall"}
{"text":"2 stars for really,really good scratch made dishes.
2 stars for service,hospitality & atmosphere.
Both Charity & Sandy are very welcoming & easy to talk to,and Charity really goes out of her way to make sure everyone is well taken care of.
Now if they just come up with some competitive happy hour specials they can get that 5th star,and i wouldn't be writing this review from La Casa de Juana!!"}
{"text":"A few of my teammates wanted to come here after our game.  It's a small to medium store front on the corner.  It offers both inside and outside (misting system) seating.  I ordered 2 street tacos (Carne Asada & Al Pastor) and it was pretty good.  The chips and salsa were good and the salsa was very flavorful.  The service (Jasmine) provided was really good, she was attentive and quick to fill the orders.  I could easily see coming here again."}
{"text":"Street tacos are edible, but far from great.  Prices are about $2 per street taco, and $3 for a fountain drink (huh?).  Service is mediocre, the server messed up our order and took forever.   They do have a lot of tequila as their name suggests, but limited selection of beers.  Leines summer shandy and Pacifico are the closest thing to craft beers...  Overall, as other reviews noted they are overpriced for what you get, and the food is nothing special."}
{"text":"Well let's see the beer was nice and cold. The street tacos we had were dry. The flavors were good just not really what we expected by reading the reviews. Our server/bartender was very nice and seemed to be the only one working Taco Tuesday. He did a wonderful job considering he had no help. We were there during shift change. Afternoon shift looked and acted very unprofessional. One was actually wearing shorts a top and chanclas. Very disappointing since there's very little in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Well I was a little hesitant to give this place a try after reading these reviews. I took my chances and let me tell you...it was so worth it! Served was awesome brought our food fast, came around to refill our drinks, etc. queso fundido was amazing!"}
{"text":"Tacos Tuesday 99 cent street tacos so of course it's busy. At first we sat and a few other tables sat down and got helped before us even though we had already been waiting. So I think it's seat yourself no sign but I think the guy said that and didn't come over with menus. Finally another guy asked us if we had been helped so maybe they don't have set sections but he brought my Diet Coke really quick. And was really helpful explained the special without asking. I got carna asada which was a little beefy and salty not much flavor. My fiancé tried a mix and I tried the marinated chicken which was awesome. She had a chicken taco not marinated that she loved. She said the pork kinds are also salty. So recommend this place to people who like chicken tacos. Generally I don't like chicken but I'll be returning soon. Mainly I loved the guacamole salsa which was outstanding. Ask for it. The regular salsa is very good not very hot with lots of flavor. I didn't like the spicy salsa.  They also have ceviche and shrimp tacos that looked outstanding I just went for the taco Tuesday special."}
{"text":"Great tacos, horrible atmosphere, and worse service. Great tacos. :) okay little spot."}
{"text":"We wanted to eat somewhere near after swimming all day and found this place with high ratings. It was surprisingly delicious. Staff very accommodating with quick service. They didn't have Mexican pizza so I ordered a chicken quesadilla instead and it was delicious. I'm curious to try the pizza next time. I don't like carne asada fries but this one was really good! They had sports on so my boys could watch the game while I was watching something else. They had a juke box playing also. Overall great place and service. We will be back without the kids next time!"}
{"text":"Great food, hence the 1 star. Service is horrible. Visited for first time, not enough wait staff. The ones there, have no idea what to do. Food comes out @ different times. I saw people leaving after waiting 15 min or more to have their order taken. They did pay attention to what appears to be their regular customers & large groups. I'm all for supporting local business, but this was beyond bad, even tho we told our waiter it was our 1st time there. Not going back."}
{"text":"Well I must say pretty glad this place is in the neighborhood and had a chance to finally stop in and try the 99 cent Taco Tuesday...4 different kinds to choice corn or flour tortilla which is great free chips and Salsa. Gotta say kinda disappointed in the El Pastor but the Carne Asada and the TINGA tacos were aaaaaaaamazing no complaints...got kinda busy (530ish) and the service kinda slowed downed which is understandable but something they can work on, but all in all the food is great the atmosphere is Fun and up beat TVs all around with different sports going on. Definitely a niice little place to stop in and have lunch or dinner! Not to mention $1.00 beers on Wednesday!!!"}
{"text":"These tacos are amazing, party of 11 for my mates 26th birthday and the food was good all around and beer was cold. With the positives being said, the service was absolutely terrible. Only saw our server every 10 minutes (that's along time for 11 people) food took about 45 minutes. Just felt like we were abandoned by our server. Cool atmosphere though!"}
{"text":"The only tacos I usually eat are shrimp. (Being Pescatarian and fish tacos can be greasy ) Sharkeys has some of the BEST shrimp tacos I have every had. They are fantastically prices and super filling. Pairing tacos with a nice tequila and this is definitely a great local bar. the wait staff is friendly and attentive to your needs at all times throughout your visit."}
{"text":"These fish tacos made my week!!!! Definitely coming back in to see Michaels amazing smile behind the bar! So happy I found a place with amazing tacos AND SO MUCH TEQUILA"}
{"text":"We decided to try sharky's after seeing the Facebook ads. We went for taco Tuesday. I saw Menudo on the menu and decided to try it. It was good and the corn tortillas were delicious. My husband and friend had the street tacos and said they were very good. We also tried an order of churros with ice cream and I must say this dish did not disappoint. Now for the reason I only gave it 4 stars: the service. Only one young lady was working in the front and there were quite a few customers. We waited a while to order and waited even longer for our food. I had to ask for chips and salsa after the food was brought to our table. The chips and salsa could've been better. I will return to try your tacos soon. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The only thing that I do not like here is the decor...so bland, dreary and boring. Other wise, food is excellent, drinks are good and strong (one of, to date, the best margarita I have ever enjoyed) and, oh yeah, the food. Their food here is awesome. I love their salsa and their tacos. My boyfriend likes the al pastor, I like the chicken and the shrimps tacos. all are tasty. The service is above par and I honestly wish this nice little watering hole had more love from the community. Either our neighborhood is prude (we live a few seconds away) or people are more likely just flat out lame and enjoy Burger King over quality tacos, service and experience. All for basically the same price. Thanks Sharky's you rock. Just hopefully one day they get enough business to upgrade or remodel the dreary interior. Seriously worth checking out though :)"}
{"text":"Really good tacos and the salsa was delicious! Very friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place.
My boyfriend and I walked in tonight looking for some Taco Tuesday action and found just that. We were greeted immediately and told to sit wherever we wanted. I know the place opened not long ago so it wasn't busy, couple people here and there so we got service right away as well.
We were stoked when we found out the street tacos were only .99 cents, my boyfriend got all 5 (chicken, asada, barbacoa, tinga and Al pastor) and I got the Fish (3.95) and 2 barbacoas. All the tacos were absolutely amazing, the fish taco was big and filling with a nice size piece of fish and the street tacos were mini but full of meat and filling. Also, the chips and salsa are delicious. 
Overall, the first experience here was amazing and we plan on going back next Tuesday haha! I highly suggest this place to anyone in the area. Big thanks to the servers and owners, very kind and patient."}
{"text":"If you want a beer, great! If you want food, try some other place. The tacos, the burrito, the fries, no thank you."}
{"text":"*worst customer service I've ever experienced* I have to say we were very excited to see this place open.  It turns out they are currently in a \"soft open\" period.  We came in last night very excited for some awesome tacos and tequila.  After listening to our server complain for some time about a walk out we asked what the specials were and both asked for the wells. We were told the wells was not very good but hey- i don't drink for the taste.I ordered a tequila sunrise with pineapple instead of orange juice and let our server know if that wast available in a wells id have a vodka coke same as my date. We were served 2 drinks we were told were $6 a piece.  I found this to be alarming as the wells drinks are listed at $4.50.  We were told by the server that they didn't use wells and after arguing back and forth decided not to have him remake the drinks and that we would not be ordering the food we were so looking forward to.  As i drank my tequila sunrise made with orange juice despite my specific request for pineapple juice and my date drank his very watered down (because of the crushed ice they use) vodka coke; we asked for our check and to speak with a manager.  At this point we met the bar manager who was a very perky individual.  She happily confirmed we had ordered a tequila sunrise with pineapple and that she made a tequila sunrise with orange juice and handed us a bill for both $6 drinks.  We asked her to adjust it.. She came back with a bill adjusted an entire $1.50.   
.... it was an interesting night."}
{"text":"Husband and I were so excited to try this place. We walked over one night and thought the food was great. Drinks were okay and the beer selection was very limited. We decided to go back one night. No one greeted us and the restaurant was dark with a DJ blasting music. It was a week night so we were surprised by the atmosphere. Since no one ever greeted us or acknowledged, we just left. 
It just sucks because we live within walking distance and were so excited to have a place nearby. But I'd rather go to the Taco Bell in the same shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Service is awful, always get slow service rarely get followed up on and the staff always seems to want to be somewhere else and they show it. And they are never busy. However, the street tacos, chips, and salsa are good enough to have me back when I have the patience to deal with the wait staff. Order for carry out or arrive prepared to wait around."}
{"text":"Myself and coworker got in from a late flight and found this place on Yelp.  Food was good. Service was awesome, never waited on anything. Atmosphere is clean and quiet. Would recommend this for a light meal."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this establishment, and we were all pleasantly surprised. The table side guac was delicious! I ordered three street tacos which were all amazing! Everyone in my party loved their food. I gave 4 stars for amazing food, but the decor could be better. The service was great,  they were quick and friendly.  It's definitely a place we will return to."}
{"text":"Is it in the best location? No
Is it in the best neighborhood? No
Can any self respecting temple to the taco say differently? No
Like those that came before it, this taco joint packs authentic combinations, classic flavors, and steadfast favorites. Top that off with an ice cold beer and you have a recipe for a satisfying trip to this spot. Their tacos have generous portions of succulent meats, prepared thoughtfully and cooked skillfully. The same can be said for their burritos, sopes, and tortas. Give it a shot, there is no weak menu item. You won't be disappointed!

PS Alex the bartender is amazing"}
{"text":"I will have to say I was shocked. Decor threw me off. Kinda tacky in my opinion. But the food and drinks were extremely delicious. Best michelada I've had in Arizona so far. Tacos delicious! Nachos very very delicious. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Okay. My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant thinking it was going to be decent based off the reviews. I am usually a super understanding person so please trust me when I say I'm not just posting this to bitch because I have nothing better to do. I go to restaurants frequently and i have to say this was one of the worst ones I've ever been to in my entire life. DO NOT GO HERE.

 Immediately when we walked in on a Saturday at 5:30 pm, there was only one other table in the whole place. It was a nice day out so we decided we wanted to sit on the patio.. When we got out there an employee was smoking right in the patio area and was literally yelling back and forth with the employees inside. There was a beer just sitting on one of the tables outside and we shortly realized that the employees sit around and drink beer and smoke on the patio. A worker about thirty minutes after we had been there walked out to the patio with a beer, drank the full beer, started smoking and then went back inside. Prior to this gentleman walking out and drinking on the job we had ordered another taco.. Our waiter came out and said there would be a delay. We kept looking at the clock and it was thirty minutes before the ONE two inch taco came out. We're pretty sure the gentleman on the patio smoking and drinking was a cook because we never saw him walking around inside so he had to of been in the kitchen for the most part and a few minutes after he went back inside we got our taco... That took the whole thirty minutes he was outside to cook apparently.. 

Last but not least we ordered a queso dish as an appetizer, we didn't receive it till after our main course and it was horribly burned THERE WAS NO CHEESE IN THE \"QUESO\" THAT WASN'T BURNED AND HARDENED. I'm adding a picture of it."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great atmosphere and really good tacos. Came in on taco Tuesday and could not have been more pleased."}
{"text":"Your time here will depend heavily on who the bartender is. One of the guys, (not Alex, or Oscar) is an ego maniacal bastard. If I head over, and see this dude behind the bar, I go right to another bar now. He has no hustle.. moves like a Galapagos tortoise who just woke up from a nap and shit.., randomly changes drink specials, and has a general dick head attitude. One time, I asked what the specials were, and he said 6 dollar micheladas ALL DAY! I was like word.. lemme get 2. One for me, one for my homie.

We drank them shits up and went to order more, and dude was like yo, they are 9 bucks now.. 

WTF happened to $6 all day, you bitch made shiester?! 

Oh, sorry.. I shouldn't have told you that.. they are not 6 bucks... 

Lame. We went and bought beer at another bar."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place since it is right down the street from my house, but I've tried it twice now and it's just ok.. 

The first time I came in no one greeted us so we sat ourselves, then sat there for a really long time while the 1 waitress walked past a bunch of times and the bartender also did nothing. Keep in mind there was 1 other table full, and maybe 2 people at the bar. The place was empty! I nearly walked out when the bartender told the waitress to look over and that we were there. I seriously felt invisible! It was nuts. 

On that trip we ordered the sharky's fries, and had carne asada and al pastor tacos.  The al pastor was really good, but the asada was so light in color it looked like chicken, and it didn't have any flavor. Also, the fries weren't really crispy and were a bit limp :-(

We decided to try it again this week, and this time I had the fish taco, which was edible. I'm so confused about it though, on the menu it said beer battered, but it came out with no batter and a red seasoning on it. It was a nice size piece of fish, but somehow the taco still looked super wimpy and empty. My boyfriend went with the al pastor again which he liked, and which I should have probably just stuck with!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Street tacos are the best! Melissa is very enthusiastic, friendly, with a cool quirky sense of humor to make your time enjoyable. 
Love this place
Manny is ok too lol 
Oh and the night bartender Alex is cute ladies.. and a great bartender!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon. Not busy at all. Waitstaff was ok, I think they were also doubling as a bartender so it wasn't as quick as I would have liked. Food was really good, got, as described. It was fairly clean inside. I would return."}
{"text":"Great for taco  Tuesday  wish they had more options besides beer for the taco Tuesday patience  it's busy  but worth it"}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive service, yummy tacos and stiff margaritas. Will definitely come back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Best Taco Tuesday in town I been coming here for the last 6 months and its always the same great hospitality. The carnitas street tacos are always on point. Thank you Alex and Manny for taking care of the regulars."}
{"text":"Bartender had something on her mouth at the same time she was trying to say something to us, I ask what was she saying she repit her self walk away and mumble something else. Server did not explain the menu to us, my husban ask for the nachos, she did not ask him if he wanted any meat with them so they were just plane. Wing look like Tyson's wing,  ranch taste like the one they sale at the dollar store. Nachos used to be so good here big and tasty, same with the tacos, no lime with them. Never again."}
{"text":"Valen verga (kidding) Service sucked. Took 40 minutes to get out food. Tacos were meh at best. Beer was the only food and tasty thing about our meal."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this little gem when I was at the bank that blocks the view of this place. But once you've been there and know where it's at.....you will definitely come back. I had the Sharky burrito and it was huge ...and probably the best I've had. The service was amazing! Charity (I think that was her name) is a doll and very friendly. She makes you feel at home. 
I'm going to return to try some of their huge selection of tequilas.  I read some of the negative reviews and I don't see where they were coming from. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! First time here for basketball game with drinks and amazing street tacos! They had some great deals, and I am definitely looking forward to coming back!!"}
{"text":"I came in today for lunch as I often do. Service was great as usual. But what happened to the cute shirts? Girls look kind  of like Qdoba employees now. You've lost your sense of style Sharky's. That's something that separates you from the cookie cutter wannabe Mexican restaurants. Still love the food and service though - we'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice place, bartender took the extra time to make sure everything was perfect. Found my new margarita spot I think."}
{"text":"First time visiting, only one person working tables at lunch time on a Friday, so things were kind of slow. I ordered a lemonade and my coworker ordered a water, our waitress brought out two waters... I wasn't charged for a lemonade, no big deal, but a little concerning. She brought out chips and salsa and took our order, the salsa wasn't bad. I had three tacos, regular tacos not the street tacos. I chose Tinga Chicken, Shrimp, and Fish, it came with rice and beans. The beans were good, the rice was ok. The Shrimp tacos was very good, the Fish taco not so much, and the Tinga taco was ok, it was juicy and flavorful, but not very spicy. The waitress was very nice, she mentioned her nickname is 'Dory' because she's forgetful, explains the water instead of lemonade... I will probably come back to try their other tacos and have more Shrimp. It's kind of pricy, but worth checking out if you're in the area."}
