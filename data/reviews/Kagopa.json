{"text":"This restaurant is a solid 4.5/5, but I can't give half stars, so 4 it is. 

This restaurant is a hidden gem, tucked away between a car dealership and a butcher shop on Saint-Jacques. The owners are very nice and accommodating, and they have call buttons on the tables so that you don't have to wait around for someone to come to you. Pretty neat idea. 

Since it was cold and rainy, my boyfriend and I each ordered a stew. I had the Sundaeguk, a traditional Korean stew made with Korean blood sausage and bits of fatty meat, intestine and liver (not for the faint of heart) and it was delicious. The broth was light and the sausage was the star of the show. My boyfriend ordered the Haejangguk, a traditional cabbage, vegetable stew in a beef broth, with bits of beef and fresh blood. He said the stew was very flavourful. 

We have never seen either of these dishes at any other Korean restaurant in Montreal, so it was great to have found a place that serves authentic Korean cuisine. They also have more popular items such such bulgogi and bibimbap on the menu. 

Overall, great restaurant, great service. Only downside is that the location is a bit out of the way."}

{"text":"Went today with a groupon. Food was very good and service was good too. 

We ordered a Korean seafood pancake, skate fish sashimi, two beers (Tsingtao), and a goat meat stew for two. Very delicious. 

Seems to be family owned. I would recommend. Thanks again! a++"}
{"text":"Came because of Groupon deal and tried their bulgogi BBQ which was very good. Overall very much home-made style. Pancake was so so but their sausage was very interesting, never had it in other Korean places. Price is average Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Not very recommended. Not many choices in the menu. A little bit pricey. No lunch set. Korean side dishes not very tasty."}
{"text":"Worse Korean restaurant I have ever been!

$106 before tips for 3 people and we almost didn't eat anything.

Seafood pancake was undercooked ~ you can still see uncooked lumps.

Bbq for 2 people and they gave u 3 pieces of galbie and few slices of pork belly. Must be kids portion because no way 2 adults would feed of that.

Korean spicy rice cakes had maybe 10 pieces on the plate.

There are so many Korean restaurants in the neighbourhood that please go somewhere else.

They probably told their family to write the reviews...4.5* is definitely not possible!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been opened for 20 years. I'd say it is authentic Korean food, probably owned by a couple. 
The location was not near a metro but can be accessed by a bus. Also some parking spots reserved for the restaurant.
There were not many tables but with a big room for party with karaoke. I guess it's a good way to get together, singing and eating at the same time. The deco was neat and warm.  
They have blood sausage filled with rice as the appetizer, which is very rare to see in North America. I had to try this after I saw it.
Their specialties are soup/stew. First the samgye tang, is a half cornish hen filled with sticky rice and slow cooked for hours. It may tasted mild but drinking it in a cold winter made me feel hearty and healthy. It comes with salt w/ chili so you can dip the meat adding more flavor. There was a ginseng inside the chicken which seems fancy and nutritious. 
We also ordered soup with blood sausage and intestine, served in a hot pot boiling. I assume this is a very genuine Korean meal. This soup came with two home made special sauces to add more unique flavor. The third recommended dish is Gamja Tang, spicy pork rib soup. This soup can tell you how genuine a Korean restaurant is. I probably will try it next time.
Also tasty side dishes came before meals. We asked more for kimichi after we finished the first plate. Yum."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in Montreal period !!!

-FRESH (like in FRESH)
-Home-made style cuisine
-Cozy atmosphere
-Owners (wife & husband) super welcoming and funny :)"}
{"text":"GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! This place is definitely overrated! We ordered Bulgogi, Gamja Tang and Samgye Tang. Bulgogi was okay. Gamja Tang was the worst I've ever had before. And for Samgye Tang...... There was only half chicken?????

I've been to different places for korean food. There are lots of better Korean restaurants in that area! Just SKIP THIS ONE! It will destroy ur interests in korean food!"}
{"text":"My best Korean Restaurant to go in Montreal
Always satisfied with wonderful meals and happy people who work here.
Since I know this place, it's hard for me to find anywhere else as good as this :)"}
