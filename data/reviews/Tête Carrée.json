{"text":"Wonderful small stand at Jean Talon. When we visited they had a soup that was the absolute essence of asparagus and an eggplant and chickpea salad. We returned the next day for a repeat!!"}
{"text":"Must Taste Creative Flavours!  I have been here twice with a group of people, and we almost tried just about everything on the menu. Each time their flavours were unique--a surprise to the palate and were bang-on. The owner and chef will take the time to guide you through their seasonal menu with detailed explanation on his creations. It's a must to visit when we're at March√© Jean-Talon."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and Jean Talon. Great stand, friendly chef who explained each dish to us. Had an amazing asparagus salad and boeuf brochette. Asparagus salad has radish, dill, leeks and some secret spice? It was unique and delicious. We couldn't resist the pretty and sweet strawberries from the fruit stand, the chef didn't mind we were munching on the strawberries and his tasty creation at his table, even offered to wash them for us . Great find, he clearly cares a lot about his food and knows all the produce in season"}
