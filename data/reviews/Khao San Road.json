{"text":"Was very displeased as a regular client of Khao San Road. 

I have come here for a couple years... always in person. 

The other day I tried to order take out I was trying to get through for over 30mins calling over and over and over again. I was EXTREMELY unhappy with the fact that I was pushing close to an HOUR with trying to order food. I called Northern Thai and they picked up the phone immediately."}
{"text":"The pork with rice was tasty but I got it as take out last time and it was my first time there. The second time was quite disappointed, it was so loud inside, barely heard my frd talking plus the wait time. I would hv gone sth better. Just the Pad Thai is pretty disappointing, from what I remember I just remembered nothing but the loudness and the long wait"}
{"text":"We were expecting amazing Thai food after all the reviews that we read and the fact that this place was voted one of the top 100 restaurants in Toronto. 

This was disappointing. 

First off, it was really awkward sitting on the benches outside on the sidewalk, as people walked past us while to wait for our table. 

Second, when we were seated, it was so loud. It felt like we were in a high school cafeteria. There was so much noise from people talking over each other and from the loud music. We were just happy that we didn't have to share a table with another couple. 

Finally - Food was mediocre. I was extremely disappointed with the curry egg noodle dish. It was awkward to eat and I felt sick about half way through because the curry was too rich. On the flip side - I had a taste of my company's dish and it wasn't that great either - he had the beef stir fry dish with rice. The meat was nice and tender, but it wasn't flavourful. 

Wasn't worth the hype, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Here is the best advice I can provide if you're thinking about heading to Khao San Road:

1. Make reservations. Since it opened, this place has gotten great buzz for providing authentic, flavourful Thai food. As a result, people from all over the city have been flocking to this casual downtown joint for lunch and dinner. (They also do take out orders.) My friend and I arrived at 6pm on a Thursday and the place was already almost full: tables of two and four, plus the larger tables at the front that could be utilized for larger parties or cafeteria-style seating and the bar were occupied by a mix of couples, friends and colleagues from the surrounding businesses. While we waited to be seated, I noticed a sheet of laminated paper at the host's stand imploring potential, hungry customers to be patient while waiting for a table to become available.

2. Come hungry. Portions are more than reasonable and priced accordingly. We were starving and decided to try a number of dishes and split them between us: cold rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves and Thai basil (Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw); crispy squash fritters (Gra Bong); a curry dish with bell and hot peppers, kaffir lime leaves and the ubiquitous Thai basil (Gaeng Panang); pad Thai; and a house specialty of stir-fried minced beef with holy basil, topped with a fried egg (Pad Gra Pra). We also ordered the only beer available, Singha. Not entirely sure why there is only one, but it's a light, refreshing beer and I had no complaints about it.

3. Temper your expectations. The food at Khao San Road is good, yes,but it was not exemplary. It wasn't bad by any means, but I had very high expectations that were sadly unmet. The exception was the Pad Gra Pra which was very, very good. It's a house specialty so if you go, you might be best to stick with the items on that particular part of the menu. There was nothing wrong with the food in particular; however, after hearing such glowing reviews from both friends and reviews, I was anticipating more.

Additionally, we found the service lacking. Our order was taken promptly and our first round of drinks appeared in short order. The problems started when food began to arrive at our fairly small table faster than we could eat. I pointed this out to our server who shrugged and kept piling on the plates. Once we had all our food, our server disappeared, a problem on two fronts: we had no room to maneuver and we wanted another round of Singhas. We were able to flag her down eventually and we were served with much reluctance from that point.

Khao San Road is not a bad restaurant by any stretch. The food is better than average but not spectacular. Stick with the house specialties and you'll likely do well. If you're going to go in for a sit-down meal, reservations are a must. Better yet, call ahead for take-out and have a couple of beers ready to go at home."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try the food at Khao San Road, since I had heard such great things and seen the Yelp ratings. And, the raves about the food are absolutely correct. The food is good (but even still, I've had better Thai). Unfortunately, the owners and the service I received completely ruined my experience. 

I was staying at a local hotel, which made reservations for our party (and I heard the concierge make the reservation). When we got to the restaurant, they first couldn't find our reservation; after waiting 10 minutes, they tried to seat the four of us at a table for two in the back corner. There was no way the four of us could fit around this small table. So, the OWNER (note: not just an employee) apologized and offered us a round of drinks on the house to make up for the delay. We were finally seated, but again the owner came over to our table to tell us that we didn't have a reservation and basically called us a liar. We asked him what he would like us to do - we already had appetizers on the table, so he told us to stay (so what was the point of him harassing us again?). 

The bill came and our drinks were not taken off the bill. We called the two co-owners over and they told us we all must have misheard and that had never said anything like that. Blatant lie. He then called us liars and told us we were trying to get out of paying. He then proceeded to charge our credit cards twice, so somehow I now am paying three times what I should have been paying (since those drinks were never taken off). As a customer, I've never been treated so poorly. So, yes, the food is good, but there are equally good / better places out there that don't treat their customers so horribly. Do yourself a favor, avoid the crowd and wait, the insults and harassment, and go eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good pad tai but asking to simply add basil into the chicken pas tai was not able to be done...."}
{"text":"I have heard and read about this place so many times! And I called to make reservation once, well I have been told that they don't accept reservations (considering how popular this place is!) luckily, we came here around 5:30 on the Friday night, without waiting, we were seated. We ordered three different kinds of curry and the crispy rice salad~ I have to say my friends are right! They make the BEST Thai food!!"}
{"text":"I used to work a block away so was there soon after it opened.  It was packed from the start but it lives up to the hype and I have never been disappointed.  I stopped by with some friends from out of town after a visit to the CN Tower and it was a nice counterbalance to the touristy scene, being all full of downtown hipsters without a tourist in sight. 

It was a Friday smack in the middle of the lunch rush but we got a table in about ten minutes.  The entire staff was tremendous, which alas is not all that common at popular hangouts with frequent 30-60 minute waits.  They can get a little uppity (and a little run ragged), but not here.

The kicker is that I was with my 5 year old daughter and 1 1/2 year old son and the staff didn't flinch.  We are not their usual target audience but they brought us a high chair and generally worked around our noise and mess (my kids are not new to restaurants so aren't a total terror but still... they're kids).  

I guess I should say something about the food.  I usually hate to order pad thai since it's sort of a cliche, but it's just so good I can't help myself.  And the combo is wicked and well worth the extra three bucks.  The soup blows me away every time.  How do they do that?"}
{"text":"Came here around 7:30pm on a week night .... packed.... waited for 45 min as they do not take reservations. If you go as a big group- good luck! you wont get seated unless you whole group was present. Food was delish, a little expensive .....and portions were on the smaller side.  Place is really small, service wasn't too great. Maybe they should hire more servers. Had to wait for awhile to get water and for refills."}
{"text":"Love this place - best Thai in the city and great atmosphere.  My favourite lunch spot with clients who dig food.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for an early dinner on Saturday. We waited for 30 min before seated. It was very crowded.. i mean VERY and was pretty loud too but we didn't mind that much.

she ordered a chef special pad thai and it was  DELICIOUS, one of the best pad thai i ever had, considering i've had many times of pad thai including in Thailand... i actually liked this place's pad thai more than the ones i had in Thailand.... weird. not sure what should i think now. well who cares, i still loved it.

i ordered a green curry with pork with spicy. this was OK. should've asked for extra spicy since it felt like a mild. lots of meat. the curry was good, it was creamy and i can taste the coconut milk, which is what i like.

next time when i want pad thai, i'm definitely going there."}
{"text":"Many would pass by this place without a second glance since it is located in the entertainment district with few other restaurants around. I tried this place out with friends right after work but unfortunately one was running late and we had to wait almost 45 minutes for a table. Due to popularity, Khao San will not let your party sit down until all the members are there. Grr, fair enough but we were HUNGRY! 

We ordered the squash fritters to start off with and happily devoured them. I got the pad thai and ahh, definitely one of the best pad thais I've ever had! It had a complex taste and I happily ate most of it up. 

The only thing I can say is the dishes are a tad bit on the expensive side, but that's what you get for quality!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a late dinner on a Sunday. They have limited hours in Sunday's of 5p-10p so it can get a little busy. We only waited for 20 minutes to be sat. 

We ordered the fresh rolls as a starter and my goodness, the flavor; it was unreal. As a main course we both ordered chicken pad Thai. My wife's at a spice level \"0\" and a \"3\" for myself. Both very flavorful and good. The portions were solid. Each of us took home leftovers afterwards. 

I wanted to give this place five stars bc the food and atmosphere were great. However, our server failed to be welcoming in an way. He even rolled his eyes at me as I asked for more water. Not justified seeing as how we both had been dry for most of the meal. 

I would certainly return to Khao Sun Road in the future but I'd keep my fingers crossed for a server who wasn't a dick."}
{"text":"So we finally tried it out to see what the big deal is.  I didn't see what's so impressive with this place - maybe it's the allure of huge line ups and a tiny hole of a place - because the food tasted like any other Thai restaurant outside of food court ones.  I find everything way too salty."}
{"text":"Delish! Just wish they did delivery."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and have sampled many Thai restaurants all over GTA. Found some decent ones that serve good thai food, but feel like quite often it's missing a little bit of kicks.

Saw the raving review about Khao San Road on Tripadvisor awhile back, wanted to try it but didn't want to deal with the guaranteed line-up. Last night, we finally put our act together and lined up during dinner hour and found out what we have missed out on all this time. 

The food is AMAZING. We ordered the soup of the day, the chef special pad thai, and the green curry shrimp and loved every single dish. The chef really knows how to perfectly balance the flavour of lemon grass, basil, fish sauce, and curry. I finished the meal with an absolutely full stomach but still wanting for more.

The service is good. The menu and the set up of the restaurant in some ways reminds me of Salad King. But the service is definitely way better. We sat by the bar and our waiter was making some special tea. As I was curious about what it tastes like, he actually offered to let us sample some, and it was delicious. Overall, our waiter is tentative. He made the effort to make conversation with us without being intrusive and we have really enjoyed it.

The wait IS long. I would like to go there more often, especially that it's on my way home from work. But I don't know whether I'm willing to wait in line on a regular basis. We arrived at the restaurant at around 6:40 and got our table at around 7:30 so unless you are willing to have dinner at odd hours, you have to put up with the wait.

The dining room IS noisy. I tend to speak more quietly so I literally had to scream the whole time even though my friend was sitting right next to me. It is a pretty cool environment though.

Overall, we enjoyed our experience and will certainly come back. I would recommend to anyone except for those who want something with a more romantic ambient."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! Rice was perfectly cooked and curries were flavourful and well spiced. It only gets 3 stars because the service was fairly lacklustre and although quick, it was merely fine not really friendly or hospitable. Definitely worth another try."}
{"text":"Just an ordinary Thai restaurant. Thai food is ok but horrible horrible service!!! The stuff is not friendly at all."}
{"text":"The food is great here! 
Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto.
Only thing I didn't like was that it is ALWAYS full, so you'll most likely have to line up."}
{"text":"The food here has gotten worst and the service wasn't the greatest either. Very average place now"}
{"text":"Authentic thai spot.

It's always busy here, so that's a good sign that it keeps its customers happy.

I've been to this restaurant at least 4 times since December and I've never had a bad experience.

I like to come during lunch because the prices are cheaper.

Khao soi - $12 at lunch

Pad Thai - $12 at lunch; $14 at dinner

On Tuesdays, they have a red curry chicken special for $9."}
{"text":"The portions were small, and it was more expensive than we expected. The food was very delicious. We also ordered garlic shrimp appetizer, which was 10 bucks for 6 small pieces of shrimp. It tasted good bit not worth the price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service! You'll likely have to wait to be seated as it's so popular but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Toronto.And I've tried every good Thai restaurant in the city. Khao San is \"the bomb\"..
tried pretty much most of their lunch and dinner menu..
order for anything and have a Singha Thai beer with it and you feel like you are eating in Thailand."}
{"text":"It's good, enjoyed it. Really a palate-gasm. Best thai food probably in the city. Their special iced tea is probably 2k calories, but amazing. 

They had a good variety of foods, only thing I didn't like is that they hold lineups outside in the winter - they open at 5... but its actually too cold to wait outside. That turned me off a little. Should invest in some heaters outside for the winter with such crazy demand and lineups."}
{"text":"I am a frequenter of the Thai Express at 150 King in the Path, there Spicy Chicken Pad Thai is like crack, not all Thai Express's are the same but the value for what you get at the 150 King West location is hard to match. I decided I should compare Khao San Road's Pad Thai to Thai Express as I'm sure this place is more authentic. As soon as I walked in I was surprised with the vibe, what came to mind was it's a place the Sex and The City girls would be seen at with some Hipster-city-centrals. I ordered 2 chefs special chicken Pad Thai's to go as I wanted the guy I work with to try it too we both hit Thai Express hard. The server was a nice guy the vibe was great, It took an hour which I'm cool with as this place is busy, when I got back to work opened it up it was 2 Tofu Pad Thai's!!... I can see how mistakes can happen but that was a big mistake. It was ok but the lack of chicken and the fact that the value doesn't even come close to the 150 King Thai Express (I've had Pad Thais there that I wasn't impressed, to saucy but %90 of the time its gooooood) I have been told Khao San Road has dishes they are more known for so I will have to try one of those and get back to you."}
{"text":"These people aren't joking when they are talking about spice. I got a little ahead of myself, maybe a little cocky... I had the beef and rice (very good btw) but couldn't finish because it was so dang spicy. Like they say, \"we can always add some but can't take any away\". Play it safe! I ended up sharing the pork noodles which were the best I've had. 

Very nice staff, hole in the wall place, id definitely recommend if you find yourself in Toronto. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The squash fritters are great! Make sure to share because they are very filling. Great fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Solid food and service.  Good option for eating around TIFF Lightbox.

Definitely recommend getting there early to avoid the lines (i.e. when they open or even before opening time).

They are quick to get the food out after you order so a good choice ( if you can get in there early enough) for pre movie at Scotiabank or Lightbox or a theatre show in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome panang curry and my husband is a regular lunch customer.  He recommends the rolls and pad thai.  It is generally quite busy so expect to wait 20-30 mins to get a seat."}
{"text":"This place is always highly rated and it's not hard to see why. Best to come either right when they open or just after the noon time rush. Its always jam packed, and it can get frustrating. I always get the khao soi (best in the city) with generous portions of beef and crispy bits, and the bf gets whatever the curry of the day is. Soups and sauces are always so so flavorful. Best to have just water to down it all as to not get overwhelmed with flavors  but sometimes I just can't help but treat myself to their iced tea. Yummm."}
{"text":"The place is too packed and the food is too salty. The flavoring was fine, but it really just tastes like usual Thai food you get at the food court... Nothing too special. Special food was normal..."}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is amazing. My mouth is watering just thinking about the green curry."}
{"text":"This is a good Thai restaurant.  The servers are not so friendly but the food makes up for it.  The squash fritters were strange and I would not order them again.  They brought one appetizer and not the other which usually does not happen in good restaurants.  The main courses were really good.  The portion sizes are large.  They have both a regular and vegan menu which is a huge plus. They play very loud music, so conversation is limited."}
{"text":"Idk what happened to the old KhaoSan Road...
The food was horrible. Customer service was meh"}
{"text":"After having been to Thailand, I hadn't found a place with authentic pad thai until I came to Khao San Road. The restaurant was unassuming from the outside. A small line-up before we got to our seats. We got Thai iced tea, which was neon orange and full of flavour. Delicious. 

We got spicy chef's pad Thai and Khao soi (Burmese influenced coconut curry soup with egg noodle). We had ask for a touch of spicy-ness and we got what we were looking for. The portions were quite generous, that we had lunch for the next day.

So happy to have found a flavourful authentic thai meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"Unbelievable horrible service! they think they have a good business so they can ignore customer feelings. 
We were 3 people walked in, the front girl want us to share a corner of the big table with other 6 customers. Frankly, the space was not enough to put 3 big plates. So we ask to move to a 4-people table, there were 2 empty table back there. The server denied our request and said: This is the only thing I can give u or u can wait another 40min. 

 After we sit down, My friend got a phone call from his girlfriend who wish to join us, when she came and took a sit, the same server came and showed her poker face and said: SORRY YOU CAN NOT COME AND SIT LIKE THIS, YOU HAVE TO WAIT IN THE LINE!. The line she talking about was a couple who waiting for a table for 2. There were empty tables in the restaurant at all time!!! They still waiting because you are too chip to give them a big table!! 
That was such a embarrassment. My friend have to say,\" I won't odder any food, I just sit here, is that ok?\" Then she said: SORRY, BUT IT IS OUR POLICY, YOU HAVE TO RESPECT OUR POLICY. 
OK. Not pay any tip for such horrible service is my policy as well, you have to respect that. 

Will never come back again."}
{"text":"Good food but service is crap.  Hostess was rude so its best to get take out and avoid the crappy service."}
{"text":"hands down the BEST, BEST, BEST Thai I've ever had on the North American continent. Flavors were light, clear, and crisp. I opted for a \"simpler\" lunch dish: the green curry with rice right before we embarked on our long journey back to NYC. Even the thai ice tea wasn't like the overly strong and sweet ones they serve down here. Food is NOT drenched in oil at all, which I loved. Being the first place we walked by on our first day in Toronto, I'm glad we saved the best for last. 

On our first day in Downtown, the Bf and I decided to explore the area and ended up walking by and noticing the long line outside Khao San Road. The nice guy taking down names was outside and was sweet enough to recommend great restaurants/food joints in the area for banh mi and other types of cuisines which completely guided us through our next few meals. Service in general is great."}
{"text":"One of the few places where you can find Khao Soi outside of Chiang Mai.  The chunks of beef were amazingly tender.

We went at 6pm and still had to wait about 15 mins as they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Definitely the best (and certainly most authentic) thai in the city.  great place!!!"}
{"text":"Some say that this is the best Thai food in the city...  I would agree with this statement!  They have a limited menu and everything on it is satisfying.  The Khao Soi is the best of the best.  I have never seen it offered at any other Thai restaurant and I am always stuffed at lunch. It is beef in a curry broth with noodles and crispy noodles on top.  I only come here for lunch because it is with in walking distance to my office. Unfortunately the entire city tries getting a seat here as well, so it is always a wait to sit and a longer wait to be served.  Try coming at 11:45 or at 1:30 if you want to have the best experience possible."}
{"text":"Their PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE was so good! It was just really packed when we came. Hopefully they'll expand to entertain more guests!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Khao San Road for dinner, and it was amazing (and he's a hard man to please!).  The atmosphere is great - maybe a bit loud with the communal tables but everyone was having a good time.  We had the squash fritters to start which were amazing!  Basically any vegetable deep fried is good...  I digress...  I had the Bangkok style pad thai and my husband had the khao soi.  We both loved our food!  
One annoying thing is that they don't take reservations so we had to wait for 30 minutes for a table (we arrived at about 6:30pm). If you have somewhere to go (like we did that night), it may not be a good dinner option because you might feel rushed.  Also, if you have more than 2-4 people in your party, I would not recommend it unless you go first thing the place opens!  Otherwise, you're in for a long wait - especially since they won't seat you unless everyone in your party has arrived.  
Overall, good experience and I would go there again."}
{"text":"C'est bon!"}
{"text":"One night in Bangkok...

In the spirit of accuracy, I will admit I was here for lunch, during the day, but I love that song and it's a great line to start with. Being the birthday boy, I was curious to check out Khao San Road, the place I regularly see overflowing with patrons during my daily lunch time walks. 

At first sight, it's a trendy little hot spot complete with all the hustle and bustle. I said trendy, not classy. Nothing about this Thai gem is classy and that's what makes it appealing. The restrooms leave something to be desired, and the plethora of bikes and cleaning supplies piled outside them makes me wonder if they really don't care or they really are going for that authentic Khao San Road (Bangkok) feel. My pad Thai looks amateur in its presentation: a nest of rice noodles with a wedge of lime. Appearances can be deceiving, and its love at first bite. I would say this is the best pad Thai I've had in the city. My date has ordered the breaded garlic tofu appetizer and although my distaste for soy keeps me in hesitation mode, I give in and sample it. Kudos to the chef for luring me with the incredible aroma and endearing me to tofu, due largely in part to the crispy panko and the divine dipping sauce. The Thai tea is huge and far too heavy on the sweetened condensed milk for my taste. Our server Kyle will charm your socks off and great at his job. 

A sweet spot with amazing food. Don't plan on lingering here though; the turnover is fast and it's evident the staff value those who eat and go."}
{"text":"This is a cool little Thai restaurant.  The food was very well prepared and everyone was happy with their dishes.  One could say the portion sizes were a little small but I was ok with it because I care more about quality and flavor than feeling stuffed.  We were told that they can't server alcohol for the tables on the sidewalk.  We would have to wait for an inside table if we wanted a drink.  The crowd was young, upbeat and loud.  Very hip."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with a couple of friends on a Wednesday night around 9.15PM the place was packed. We were told to wait for around 15mins and finally got a table as promised. One thing to watch out for is that some of their tables are very big to seat 8+ people and they sometimes put two or three groups of people on the same table. The place is going to be filled with people and loud music. So not the perfect spot for quiet dinner.  

I was in mood for thai food that day and all I was concerned as about good food and a reasonable service. When I saw a place this packed my expectations with regards to service was already low. Then came the menu - the menu itself was compact one pager. We chose the garlic chicken, street style pad thai and one of my friends ordered curry chicken. The garlic chicken was amazing. It was breaded, tender and served with thai sauce on the side. Finally came our mains - the pad thai looked great and when I tasted I felt that it was the best I have ever had in my entire life so far. I order for a spicy one and it had a kick to it. Not too sweet nor too hot for my liking. It was just perfect. 

I would recommend anyone to go there for the great food, do not have too much expectations on service or ambience. I would like to go back soon."}
{"text":"KSR is always packed for dinner, so be prepared to wait for 20-45 mins. The food's always great, so it's worth the wait.

Squash Fritters - I was skeptical at first but once the dish arrived I was very pleased with how good it tasted. Portion serves two people, can serve three.

Pad Thai w/ chicken - My new favourite dish at KSR. It's spicy, tangy and the roasted peanuts add a nice crunch to the dish. Portion serves one person.

Kua Gling w/ chicken - Great tasting dish that has been consistent for the last little while. I believe the curry paste is coconut base.

*The Pad Thai doesn't taste as good when it's take-out. I'd suggest having this dish when you're dining in."}
{"text":"This and Pai are hands down the two best Thai restaurants in Toronto. Khao san road moved locations a few months ago and is now located in the lobby of a condo near Spadina. Recommend their green curry and fresh rolls (awesome dip). Their khao soi noodles are also great if you're not into rice. Rich, complex flavours to be had here for a reasonable price. 

Various levels of spice (about 7 I believe) ranging from zero spice to chef's spice. I can handle very spicy food and usually choose Thai spice- still hot but not to the point where I'm sweating and can't enjoy what I'm eating. Yum yum."}
{"text":"I decided to skip the lineup and ordered takeout instead, and it was strangely satisfying to walk past all the people smooshed up against the glass outside to get my food. Unfortunately, some of it didn't really survive the walk back to my apartment.

I got the squash fritters since everyone raves about them, but unfortunately they were pretty soggy by the time I got to them. However, they were tasty and the sauce was good as well, so I bet if I had them fresh they would have been as good as described.

The pork chef special pad thai was quite edible, but it didn't really grab me in terms of flavor. Maybe it didn't like being takeout either, or maybe I should have gotten the street style. 

My favorite is the beef pad gra prao, and it weathered its takeout experience very well. I remember being disappointed to see that it was ground beef when I ordered it the first time I visited, but its strong flavor haunted me afterward. So good.

I wish they'd move into a bigger location! The food is very good but I'm not sure that it's worth the headache of trying to get in, and it's a little pricey. I would probably just get takeout beef pad gra prao again."}
{"text":"To be honest I was excited but cautious about trying Khao San Road when it opened. Unlike everyone else I wasn't blown away by Sukho Thai.
Glad to report after 2 dine-ins and one take out that, Khan San Road totally made my list :D

First time, six of us went of a friday night after making phone reservations on the day of. We got a great table very quickly. Here's what we ordered-

Appetizers:
Squash fritter: interestingly good but not to 'squash-y'.
Garlic shrimp: probably the best appetizer we tried
Thai rolls: decent

Mains:
Massman Curry: Favourite of all six of us. Its a wonderful mixture of peanut/curry and tamarind. But the taste differs from day to day, esp the sweetness factor which we found out when we got take out another night.
3 Khao san Road specials: All of which were really great
Street style pad thai: After tasting the other curries, this noodle dish felt like it lacked flavour. Personally I don't care for the pad thais here but others disagree.

If you can handle some heat, I'd recommend go with a mix of  'medium'  and 'hot' for your dishes. 'Mild' is frankly too mild you wusses."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in Toronto.  We tried green curry, massaman curry and pad thai.  All excellent, fresh flavors, great service as well. It's worth the waiting list!"}
{"text":"Wow!! I rarely give 5 stars but in this case, wow. It was really great. We went close to 10 on a Tuesday night and it was packed, LOUD and lively. I told my friend that it felt like a restaurant in Montreal due to the action. Generally if you arrive that close to close, the restaurant turns you away but they didn't. (They earned their fifth star)

My friend is vegetarian and said that her dish was deeeelish. I had the chicken curry with noodles (Khao Soi) and my friend had the Vegetarian Green Curry dish. It wasn't expensive at all. 

When we were leaving, the guy that seating us was leaving for the day and told us to visit their other location Sukho Thai on Parliament. It is just a take out and delivery place but I'm willing to give it a try. mmmmmmm

I've been craving it all day today..............."}
{"text":"Always wanted to come here but there's always such a long line up. Finally came on a Monday evening, it was still packed but was able to get a seat in 20 minutes. 

Khao soi is always a go-to for me at thai restaurants and it was delicious, the beef! Also had the shrimp dish as an appetizer, it was really tasty but warning, the dipping sauce is spicy! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a classic case of a restaurant that became too popular and then their quality and customer service tanked. 
This is why I gave KSR a 2.
1) I went with 2 other people, and 1 friend was going to join us in 15 minutes. They would not let us take a table of 4. The restaurant only has 2 or 4 tables. This is ridiculous! So we started off with a bad taste in our mouth.
2) the green curry fried rice is one of the worst Thai dishes I've ever had. I asked if it would be possible to switch the dish after taking 2 bites of it and it was a firm no. 

Lots of places to enjoy Thai food in Toronto, never going to come back. The old Khao San road used to be my fav place to go, the new one is horrible."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars*
I made reservations for 7pm on a week day but still had to wait about 20 minutes until a table was cleared. No biggie. This place was packed so the 20 minute wait didn't seem that bad. 
The place itself is very unassuming on the outside - if you weren't looking for it you could easily walk by as their isn't large signage in the front.  Once inside, it's not your typical thai place as it doesn't have any Thai themed decor.  There's a chalk board wall that lists out their wines, a large bar, a couple of communal tables in the front and a few tables of 4 and 2 throughout the rest of the restaurant.  
We had:

Khao greup goong (under the starter menu) - it's a medium sized basket of shrimp chips that comes with a tamarind dipping sauce that becomes more and more spicy as you eat it.  The chips themselves I found not as airy as shrimp chips you get a Chinese restaurants.  Not that it's a bad thing - I liked that it was dense.  This dish is great for sharing. 

Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw (under the starter menu) - these are cold spring rolls wrapped in rice paper with their home-made chicken sausage.  It was refreshing and I really liked their tamarind, garlic sauce that was topped with peanuts. 

Gaeng Kaew Wan (under the Thai Curry menu) - this is a green curry that comes with a bowl of rice.  We chose shrimp as our protein (other options are chicken, beef or tofu).  It was delicious. It came with julienned bamboo shoots which I love so this worked for me. 

Khao Soi (under the Khao San Road Specials menu) - it's an egg noodle dish with a coconut milk curry that's topped with small pieces of crispy noodles. We selected the braised beef which I didn't like too much. The beef was on the tough side.  There's enough curry in this dish to warrant a side of rice which we ordered.  The curry in this is delicious. 

I also ordered their Chai Nom Yen which is their thai iced tea that is mixed with condensed milk.  I think it's a bit pricey for $4.50 but the cup is quite large.  It was sweeter than my liking so I had to wait for the ice to melt a bit. 

Overall it was a great meal but as with many restaurants the hype that surrounds this place is overstated."}
{"text":"Good Thai food, though hit-or-miss service and the seating is quite uncomfortable (tall stools, shared seating).  It's a good spot to grab a bite if there's no line-up, but not a great spot for conversation."}
{"text":"I get giddy even as I begin this review! I had heard about Khao San Road for ages - but had been putting off trying this place due to the horror stories I had heard about long wait times and terrible service. 

With that being said, I managed my own expectations and decided to take the leap - and boy am I glad I did! I've been there a few times since, and here's what I think: 

- Wait time strategy: So yes, the place is often packed - so rather than attempt to wait hours in line, I've now opted to order my meals for take out. This way, I can walk right in, order (squeeze a few neighborhood errands in) and by the time I'm back, my food is ready to go!

- Service & Seating: Nothing amazing, but with that being said, I've always been greeted pleasantly and have not had a bad experience yet. I can see how waiting and being squeezed in could cause some irritation to waiting patrons. The seating set up often required sharing tables. Meh, I'll take mine to go... 

So, now to the food... one word: unbelievable. I can't actually imagine going anywhere else for my Thai food offering. I've been spoiled! I can't go back! 

1) Pad Thai - chicken with medium spiciness hits the spot. Their chef's special is the way to go!

2) Both red and green curries are additive and creamy. 

3) Squash fritters are unique and delightfully crispy/fried! A must try!

4) My absolute favorite - Khao Soi. Its messy, creamy, sweet, spicy and just the perfect bowl of goodness. Hands down a favourite go-to during a busy week when you need some good ol'comfort. 

The food is so good here, I can look past any possible deficiencies in set up, service and seating. Trust me, you'll agree."}
{"text":"easily the best thai food i've ever had! LOVE the vegan menu as well :)"}
{"text":"I just got back from here about 2 hours ago and as I pulled up the page to review it, my mouth started watering. This place is good. Real good. We went with 2 friends (so 4 of us) right at 5:30pm and got a table immediately, but pretty much right after that, there was a line outside with plenty of people waiting. Our order was taken fast, but the wait to get the food was a little long. However, when it came, it was well worth the wait. I had the yellow curry and I wanted to lick the bowl (even though I couldn't finish it). I got the mild and still found it a wee bit spicy - I don't like too much spice. I could feel my face getting warm, but I paid no mind and continued chowing down. Boyfriend had the Khao Soi and it was absolutely amazing. Anything with coconut milk is amazing to me, though. I'll be back for sure and that is what I'll be ordering"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night with a group of 5. Three in our group were from Thailand.  The waitress was Thai but seemed very annoyed to speak any Thai and was rude in that she basically refused us when we asked asked that our food be spicy.  She said she would make it medium.  When she brought food she rudely slid the plates across the table and barely spoke to us.  

The food itself was not spicy at all.  In fact it was sweet.  Not authentic Thai food at all.  I had been there last summer and liked it but this time it was terrible.  The food was also more expensive than I would have thought. Also was surprised to see they had included a 15% (after tax) gratuity on the bill.  This scowling waitress sue didn't deserve it, but I didn't argue, just wanted to get out of this place as fast as I could.

Bad food, bad service and overpriced.  I won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Noisy.  Crowded.  Sublime.
My friends and I have not had a bad meal here.  Everything is delicious.  We come back agsin and shain."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZing regardless of what you order! Portions are massive, I always can make two or three meals out of it. I have been on three separate occasions. First was a Thursday night, was busy, but after a five minute wait we were in.  The second was a Friday night, and it was INSANE! Like the line up was out the door and the hostess informed us that they actually had stopped accepting patrons for the night. This was at like 730pm.... Bc their wait list was so bloody long. That was disappointing, but understandable bc the place houses maybe 60 people. The third time was a Saturday night and once again out the door packed... We luckily got on the wait list and had a drink at a local bar while we waited an hour. Totally worth it! Food was phenomenal! Bc it's a small place you have to prepare to wait if you go during highly desired times and days, also recommend having a backup restaurant in mind bc you may not even get in. Service was great, it's a young professional vibe with epic food"}
{"text":"can't wait to go back here. Most delicious meal here. I was craving Thai and was not at all disappointed. This is hands down the best Thai restaurant I have tried in Toronto. So many of them fall into the mediocre category that when I ate here its like yes I forgot this is what real Thai food tastes like. It's so great that you can customize things as far as spice, allergies and other preferences, It made it enjoyable for all our different tastes, they are really accommodating in this way and other places should take note. The rice salad, garlic tofu and three flavors pad thai were all perfection. Beyond the food it is definitely a cool atmosphere but very cramped loud and communal, they are pretty disorganized as well but very sweet and they try hard. My advice is to seriously go over your order with them a few of our dishes were missing but who cares the food is unbelievable."}
{"text":"Hipster, cool, trendy vibe with traditional flavors. Their squash blossoms are a must try! I would have to say that they could work on their customer service and friendliness. The food is very flavorful. Pad Thai and khao soi were tasty. They get a star for food, atmosphere, and speedy service but their prices and service are pretty lackluster in which they are only getting 3 stars from me.

**********Please train your staff to talk more with customers, smile and provide a service that matches your prices and location.************"}
{"text":"I have only tried the veggie pad thai - best Thai in the area. 

I always order medium spicy (however, i think there are many more spice levels above this). Always a great meal. 

Pros: 

More authentic and nice spice balance then other Thai places in the area.
Like the actual restaurant vibe. 
What seems to be the owner seems very nice and answers questions. 

Cons: 

Not really a con, but always busy. Sometimes you can't get a reservation and always have to wait (but that's what resto wants - right...)
Once had to sit at the bar with a friend and the server kind of forgot about us....
Can be loud. 

Food is good for eat-in or take-out. A few dollars extra than Thai places on Queen."}
{"text":"Fantastic thai food! Tonight was my first time there but my buddy (Tom) has been raving about this place for awhile now. 

It was pretty busy when we got there and we had to wait about 15 mins but the guy at the door was really nice. They offered us a spot at one of the shared tables or at the bar but we decided to wait for a table. There was pretty much a line up the entire time we were there. 

The food was excellent and the service was great too. The deep fried tofu appetizer was fantastic and it came with a really tasty sweet sauce. 

I had the pad thai (sam roas) which was really flavorful and the green curry (geang kaew wan) that my friend had was also very tasty. The sa koo ma prao desert (tapioca pearls in coconut milk) was very good.

The cost was reasonable - $68 for the two of us after tax and tip including wine and beer. 

Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"Good Thai place in downtown. Went during dinner time. 40 mins wait. So came during lunch time. wasn't as busy. Had their curry lunch special., along with soup, and rolls. all amazing."}
{"text":"Very very good lunch joint if you're working in the area, be sure to arrive early (11:30!!!) to ensure you don't want for a seat. Have been here over 10 times in the past year. Have tried the entire \"classic\" menu (2 types of pad thai, khao soi, pad gra prao, daily specials, apps, etc...). Only gripe is their habit of jacking up the prices for dinner (the same for pai), was confused the first time I went there for dinner because of that. Solid solid restaurant, moderately and modestly priced, they use real thai herbs (kaffir lime leaf, galangal, thai holy basil) and the cooking has this quality where you're not easily bored during the meal. I usually end up devouring my food because of this, very straight forward and loud flavours,  which I really enjoy. Asked the waiters if I could get a shirt for eating every main dish top spicy, didn't materialize though. Great place, the very cramped seating to the point where i'm bumping elbows with people at times on the communal table seating is the only thing i remember that could detract from the experience."}
{"text":"The food here is really nice, I will give them that. 
The flavours and spices are fantastic

My only issue is the quantity of the food, if im paying $15 for a pad thai, which is 95% noodles, why are the portions so small? I know noodles are inexpensive and you dont get much meat, so what gives?

Id rather goto Thai Princess and get great pad thai in a massive quantity to enjoy some the next day as well."}
{"text":"Excellent pad Thai-- get it very spicy. The Thai ice tea is also delicious. I like the service here but it can get very busy... No resos allowed."}
{"text":"There's no doubt business is really good, it's always packed when I go there but the downside is that it's next to impossible to get a table without having to wait for at least an hour and the last two times that I've been there, the wait time was between 1-2 hours.  Needless to say that I used to go there before it became really popular, now I think I will have to find another Thai place to replace it.  Tip: food is good but don't go there hungry and be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Loud, crowded, and obnoxious -- the atmosphere and attitude completely overshadows the good (but not great) food. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The pad gra prao is amazing!!! However, if you go Thai spicy with this dish, it gets a bit too hot.


Love this place, hate the wait. I recommend doing pickup."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks (thai iced tea). Be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes for a table at dinner time but it's worth the wait every time imo. Have had most of their menu items but tops for me is the khoa soi with beef. The sauce/soup is so good that I usually get the remaining bit packed up and have it over plain steamed rice the next day. Too bad they got rid of the prawn crackers from their menu though, b/c those were delicious. Also can highly recommend the garlic chicken/tofu. If you're staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, just on the other corner, call ahead and get takeout. It's much faster and then you can enjoy from the comfort of your bed while watching some tv."}
{"text":"Heard this is one of the best Thai food you could get in Toronto -- there's always a line up, rain or snow or shine.

The food is alright, friendly service before and after you're seated -- not sure if this is worth the wait though.  Tried 3 different dishes and an appetizer."}
{"text":"People in Toronto enjoy their Thai food. Almost all reviews of Thai cuisine refer to Khao San Road, and now I know why! I heard that there is often a lineup for the food, but I was lucky enough to get there 30 minutes before lunch service ended with no lineup. The place looked very hip and more of a western place rather than a traditional Thai restaurant. 

We got their 2 signature dishes, the Khao Soi with beef and the Pad Gra Prao. The Khao Soi is a curry noodle with lots of wonton crisps. You can also choose a protein to go with it - our beef was so tender it was amazing. We got the dish in mild spiciness and it was just right for me since I don't eat much spicy food. There is a notable flavour of coconut in the curry, which is something I really liked. The Gra Prao was rice with flavourful beef. We also got a fried egg (HIGHLY recommended for this dish) which made it much more smooth. The sauce that came with it was quite spicy and salty so we didn't use much since the beef was so flavourful already. This has to be my favourite non-curry Thai dish.. Sooo good. 

We also got an appie, garlic tofu! It was fried nicely without too much garlic flavour. The tofu was firm and it really seemed like you were eating meat. The sauce added a nice spicy touch to the dish as well. 

All in all a great place to go to and I see why it is so famous :) Would like to come back during dinner to try their squash fritters!"}
{"text":"I have been here about 5 times and I have always left stuffed and happy.  My waits have ranged from 0 minutes (with a reservation - and they do take them seriously) to 15 minutes (on a weekday around 5:30, for 2 people) to 1.5 hours (on a Thursday 8 pm, for 5 people) but regardless, they have always been worth it. Faves: Khao soy with chicken (seriously, omg), red curry with beef, gra bong (squash fritters) and my ultimate fave - thai iced tea.  This place is fun, vibrant, the staff is friendly, the decor is trendy and minimal and the food kicks ass. Best thai I've had in this city."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  5/5
The only problems was the wait to get a seat (30 mins on a Tuesday night)  and the wait for our food (20 mins). lots of takeout orders,  causing wait for food to be long."}
{"text":"We went as a group of 7 people...we all had such an amazing time. Nothing beats eating authentic Thai food whilst listening to 50s & 60s music!"}
{"text":"Was very excited to try this place because of the good reviews. There was a lineup on a Tuesday night! Crazy. I ordered squash fritters and pad thai. Good...but not mind-blowingly amazing. Will come back another time, but not in a rush to do so anytime soon."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food for amazing prices. Best Thai I have had in town, hands down! I would suggest trying a little bit of everything, as the appetizers are divine, so try ordering a lot of small plates and sharing!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, - we had the rice salad , the grilled steak salad, the zucchini fritters, pad khee mao and a red curry - all were good, not great, fritters too greasy, could tell the fryer oil needed to be changed - think this place is more hype than anything else - and seriously volume level of music is ridiculous - like being in a nightclub so makes it hard to enjoy, maybe food would have tasted better if we weren't so uncomfortable, we could barely hear each other talking.. Would have given it 3 stars if it wasn't for the music situation."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty damn good. I find the place incredibly loud and the 90's music that constantly plays is a little hard to take, but both are tolerable.

Showing up at noon for lunch is pointless. Arrive before 12 if you want to eat and be out before 1 - otherwise impossible.

Staff is wicked friendly and cool enough..."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what else to say that everyone else hasn't said already! Best Thai place in Toronto. I've brought so many friends here, and they all loved it.

I have tried the pad thai here, which is delicious, but my go-to dish is the pad gra prao with chicken. It is the most flavourful, delicious, mouth-watering Thai dish I have ever had. The fresh cucumber slices and fried egg on top brings the whole dish to perfection. 

It gets super busy, but I have never had a bad experience with the service, and I hope it stays that way! The restaurant is decorated simply and quite small, but that is the least of my worries. The food that is consistently amazing is what keeps bringing me back!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever eaten! Don't be deterred by the long line or the crowd you need to excuse your way through to put your name on the waiting list. I promise the wait and effort is definitely worth it! A lack of signage outside may hide this restaurant from plain sight, but once inside you're welcomed into a warm and inviting environment buzzing with energy. The casual and hip staff mirror the decor, and put you at ease to have a great dining experience without the pressure to wear you sunday best. Everything on the menu is delicious and the portions are generous. My favourite dishes include the Gra Bong (squash fritters) and Gaeng Massaman (curry with tamarind notes), and both styles of Pad Thai are excellent. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Tasty. Good. Hype. 
Went for lunch and got the curry of the day. It was really tasty. The portion is really small but great for lunch. 
The place is packed and hype. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"(3.5 stars) On a hot and sweaty day (hello Summer!), I finally made a second visit to Khao San Road.

I start with the po pia and a cha nom yen - Thai iced tea. The po pia are fresh rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves, and Thai basil. A tamarind-garlic sauce topped with peanuts and Thai coriander is on the side for dipping. The chicken sausage is springy and the vegetables serve to give a nice crunch and faint sweetness to the roll. Fresh and tasty, this is a light way to start your meal.

Accompanying my starter was the Thai iced tea. Infused with Thai spices, this is a sweet and creamy drink made with condensed milk. The tea they use is strong - almost herbal - and it reminds me of my mother's Ceylon tea that she loves so much. Not so light, but delicious and cooling. I sipped it happily, reminded of visits to Malaysia.

Gra bong are squash fritters made of deep-fried squash with red curry paste, shrimp paste, lemongrass and eggs. Like the onion bhaji, a lot of people seem to love this. Also like the onion bhaji, I am not one of those lovers. They're crispy, a little chewy, a little sweet, and a little bit spiced. By all reasoning, this should be a dish I'd really enjoy, but I'm very ho-hum on it. Still, these are nice with flavours of cumin and lemongrass coming through. The tamarind and cane sugar sauce for dipping is excellent.

The khao soi is tender braised beef with egg noodles in a coconut milk curry. Piled on top are crispy noodles, green onion, and finished with a squeeze of lime. This soupy-creamy mix of noodles is definitely a favourite. The egg noodles were perfectly cooked and mixing the crispy noodles with the chewy ones made for a nice textural play. The beef wasn't as meltingly soft as the previous time that I'd eaten this, but it was still tender. The freshness of the green onion really makes for a nice contrast with all the coconut and spice. Good stuff.

According to the menu, Gaeng Massaman is the only Thai curry with a twist of tamarind sauce and cooked with onions, peanuts, potatoes, and bay leaves. And more onions. And topped with crispy deep fried shallots. I enjoyed the roasted peanuts strewn throughout, giving the curry a nice toasty flavour. It's a good dish and highly recommended by many, but I don't feel the same excitement as when I eat a bowl of khao soi. I also felt that this was quite a large portion with the potatoes and the side of rice - I felt like I could do with just either/or.

Street pad thai - the \"authentic\" pad thai. I really enjoy the flavours of this dish - spicy, sweet and a dash of sour. The chicken pieces were tender, the noodles chewy, and things were just a bit saucy. And I'm always happy to eat a whole plate of this - except when I'd just eaten half a bowl of khao soi. And some po pia. And was still working on some iced tea. Still, I tried.

It was clear when I started lunch that I was going to be taking some things home. So I added some sa koo ma prao with my pile of left-overs. Now, I'm a big fan of tapioca and coconut, so this cool, sweet, and creamy dessert, really works for me. I like that they mix it up with some strips of young coconut flesh in there. The only thing they could do to make it even better in my eyes, is if they'd add some palm sugar to it.

At Khao San Road I found the flavours to be nuanced, dishes well-prepared, and everything had that air of authenticity to it. A good spot in Toronto for Thai.

{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place... and I'm still giving it 4 stars.  

Food, I LOVE IT! The place has a delicious and simple menu. On a summer day it's one of the areas best, and my favourite to visit.  The Street Style Pad Thai is awesome.

And now for the hate...  It's too busy... their success is a blessing and a curse.  If you're serious about dining there, you need to get there at 11:30 for lunch or you're pretty much stuck in a cue waiting.  So plan your day around this! 11:30 or an afternoon meetup at 1:30 to miss the lunch time rush. And in the evening times... forget about it. I have yet to arrive and get a table anywhere near dinner time. 

So.... love the place. The food, the space, everything about it is awesome. My only wish is that I could go back in time to when they just opened.  It was quiet, it wasn't busy... and the food was just as good as it is now.  

Who am I kidding... I got nothing but love for this place and you will too if you're a fan of Thai food and hip little spots in the city core."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time after reading yelp reviews. Finally got a chance to come here for lunch on my day off. Came right when they opened so didn't have to wait for a seat. The place did indeed fill up very quickly and was full by noon (weekday). Service is ok, no big issue there. Décor is not fancy but surroundings are comfortable. 
However, the food was disappointing. I ordered the Khao Sao with beef. Beef was pretty good quality and pieces were generous. No veggies though :( The curry gravy was waaaaayyy too sweet. And too thick. It was like eating coconut syrup. I got medium spicy which was nice, the spiciness has depth to it. But the sweetness was too overpowering and ruined the dish in my opinion. The noodles is an egg-noodle which is decent but I'm not usually a fan of it (personal preference). The lime did not add anything to the dish as the curry was way too thick and overpowering (could not even taste the fresh lime, which was meant to balance the richness). Similarly the crunchy noodles on top did not add anything to the dish for me. I would have much rather have a few pieces of tofu (like in laksa).
Not sure whether I would come back, definitely not if I have to wait in line...but if I do, I would try their house special Pad Thai with chicken. Hopefully that will live up to their reputation."}
{"text":"Great take out service. Always prompt. Probably the best Beef Pad See Ew I've ever had in my life (note: I haven't been to Thailand yet). The Thai Iced Tea is a must. It is a small restaurant so if I were you I would go early but they take your number down so you can walk around downtown and call you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is the best thai food in town. I moved from San Francisco where there's a thai restaurant on every corner and I was truly disappointed with the thai options in toronto, most of which overdid the coconut milk part making the food sweeter and unhealtheir. 
We had to wait for long for table at Khao San but it was worth the wait.The pad thai was very good with a right dose of tamarind. It got too crowded in the waiting area but the owner/chef/floor manager offered people free bites. He also came across and casually chatted about the food and service. All in all, I liked the food, the ambience, the communal seating up front, the location and the service. Five star for sure."}
{"text":"Food was great! Ordered the Fresh spring rolls, 3-flavour pad thai and the pad gra prao.  Everything was fresh and extremely flavourful.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"In our opinion the best Pad Thai in Toronto. We came here soon after returning from Thailand and it was like being transported back. Great vibe. Get there at opening or you'll have a long wait for a table. Only bad point is that their only Thai beer is Singha, but I'm nit-picking."}
{"text":"Drool worthy!

The food is A-mazing! So authentic and flavourful, prepare to leave stuffed!

The wait, not so fun but worth every minute, half hour or hour!"}
{"text":"Food is decent and very affordable. Deducted a couple of stars because when I placed a take-out order they forgot my extra order of rice, though didn't forget to charge me for it. When I contacted them, they said the the next time I ordered they would give me a discount, and that I could also go and pick up my extra rice. Haven't been back as there are other Thai places close by that I prefer over Khao San Road."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Maybe Thai cuisine is just not my thing."}
{"text":"Best thai food I've ever had. The place is noisy and you often have to wait over an hour to get seated, but it's well worth it. Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I went with my friends for lunch and  and we ended up waiting for our food for 45 minutes or so. We then asked them to pack it for take-out as we had to get back to work. Although we were pretty upset with the long wait, the food was worth it!!

The owner of the restaurant was very apologetic and gave us a huge discount which I appreciated. I would go there again, but will probably order ahead for take-out, or go there much earlier...but I'd have to say, this was the best Pad Thai I've ever had in Toronto!!! No wonder this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place but unfortunately my friend and I were quite disappointed. The line up wasn't too bad, 10 mins for 2 people on a rainy Sunday evening. We tried the Garlic Shrimp appetizer ($10). It was juicy, crispy and favourable. You can taste the garlic in the deep fried batter! I tried the Three Flavoured Pad Thai ($15) and my friend had the Bangkok Style Pad Thai ($15). The dishes were presented neatly but looked somewhat unappetizing as it lacked colour and the portions were small. Both Pad Thai tasted good however, there was not enough sauce which could explain why it lacked the tangy flavour you would find in authentic Thai food. In addition, the noodles were mushy and some pieces of chicken breast were dry. For the price, the food should not be overcooked.

The service wasn't good as well. The appetizer came quickly but our entrees took a long time. The service was so slow we initially thought the table next to us were leaving but later realized the empty plates were from the appetizers they ordered. After we finished our meal, the servers cleared our table but didn't ask if we needed anything else, water for our empty glasses or the bill. I do have to add that they did refill our glasses while we were eating but I suppose service here ends once you finish your food.

Bottomline I would not recommend this place. I'm not sure what the hype was about, perhaps we tried the wrong dishes?"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, 3 friends and I decided to try this restaurant Friday after work.  The food is delicious!  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  

There were two vegetarians in our party, and we were blown away that there was a whole veggie-friendly menu.  The 'medium' option for spiciness was perfect for me.  I had the veggie special pad thai which was very flavorful.  My friends ordered dishes with shrimp, which looked like generous amounts.

I can't wait to go back and try a curry dish!"}
{"text":"Luckily it was a short wait time for us about less than 10 minutes on Sunday. The food was absolutely amazing! We ordered the Squash fritters ($11), Three flavours pad thai ($15) and Khao soi ($14). The pricing was a bit expensive but I think it was totally worth it. The deep-fried squash fritters were very crunchy and I just love the delicious sweet tamarind sauce. We ordered SPICY-3 for both pad thai and khao soi. The flavors were perfect and their noodles were very fresh and soft. Also they had great friendly service."}
{"text":"I was very happy about the gluten free menu which gave a lot of options. The pad thai was absolutely phenomenal! We did have to wait for a table even though we went on a weeknight, but it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This reminds me of a high end restaurant in Thailand!
Try the Khao Soi.

The wait is up to 90 minutes after 5:15pm. There's a difference between 5 and 515. The staff know it's a long wait so they try their best to make it easier. The wait is the reason I didn't give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Stunningly good. Had the Khao Soi and it was amazing. Maybe best Thai I have ever had. 

They have a gluten free menu but do double check as they initially brought the non-GF version."}
{"text":"SOOO good a must go. Wait is a little long and its loud inside also family style tables but the food and the tea makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant I have been to in the city.  I've been there several times, and the depth of flavour in their dishes is astounding; I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu.  My only complaint would the the line up, they need to expand or people need to stop talking about them ;)"}
{"text":"A friend recently checked-in here on Four Square noting that the service was abysmal.  They are 100% accurate.  That being said, Khao San Road has the tastiest Thai food I've ever had (and I actually don't like Thai at all).

The food was delicious.  According to people I know who have been to Thailand, the dishes are the most authentic they've had.

The Gaeng Kaew Wan aka Green Curry was stellar.  Perfectly spicy, TONS of tender chicken, but could have had some more vegetables other than bamboo shoots and green peppers.  The Street-Style Pad Thai was so delicious.  It's unlike any Pad Thai I'd ever had, and what I imagine Pad Thai is supposed to taste like.  Really peanut-y and smokey flavour that we couldn't stop raving about.

Hopefully they work out their service issues.  The server debated with us about our credit card being a debit card, when it was clearly a credit card, and ended up double-charging us.  Annoying."}
{"text":"Khao sai dish, pad thai and garlic shrimps.

Tasty. Restaurant's funky looking, loved the arts on the wall... the sign I couldn't really read it properly wasn't sure if I was at the right place at first, but yes, I like the long tables, and the overall vibe of the place. This chick made us stay outside because the line is too long even though there was space to go inside, that was weird. Next time I'm staying inside wtf, making us freeze during winter?!"}
{"text":"The best Thai you'll ever experience! Make sure you know your spice tolerance...great ambiance but tight seating, attentive staff and delicious food. Try something different other than your run of the mill curries!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Its a hidden little gem that easy to miss. The Pad Thai and garlid chicken are AMAZING and their coconut sago has REAL coco pieces in it. I've gotten take out a couple of times and it travels well and its still warm by the time I get home."}
{"text":"Customer service was never great, but now they make you wait at the door until your whole party is there, even if you just want a table for two. Suffering from being overly hip right now. Move on."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Khao San Road  for years but have noticed a decline in the quality over the past few visits. My favourite Khal Soi isn't as buttery as it once was, read that as watery,  and the service has greatly slowed. They even accidentally substituted my dish when the default is beef. Hopefully, they will get their act together soon."}
{"text":"I've eaten at quite a few Thai places around the GTA, and this is definitely one of the best.

It started on a Wednesday night after a 105-minute wait for dinner (for two people). The hostess took people's cell numbers to notify them when their table was ready, but I never received a call. There are a few good places to hang around while you're waiting for your table, instead of being stuck outside in the cold.

The restaurant itself is definitely crowded, but I never felt too cramped. It's quite loud, but not oppressively so. Service is pretty good for its size; water refills were always prompt. That said, don't get the mango juice unless you want a huge glass of ice with mango filling the empty space.

The two times I've been there, I had the chef's special Pad Thai and the pad kee mao (drunken noodles). Both were excellent, but the chef's special Pad Thai is definitely the dish I'd return for. It was incredibly flavourful; it was spicy, sweet, and sour at the same time. My friend really appreciated that they accommodate shellfish allergies so well; they have a guide to which items are allergy-safe.

However, the saviour of the meal (and what keeps me coming back) are the fresh rolls. These rice rolls are neatly arranged, packed with veggies, chicken and spices, and are the most intricately-flavoured food item I've ever eaten (plus they're served with a stellar sauce).

For the price, you absolutely can't go wrong. The wait is worth it; show up early!"}
{"text":"Consistently unbelievable. There's a reason this place keeps winning best thai in Toronto. Pad Thai? Delicious. Pad gra prow? Delicious. Everything else? Delicious."}
{"text":"We went there on a Wednesday around 5 PM and the place was already half-full. By the time we left, there was a long line-up waiting outside. 

We shared the pad kee mao (medium spice level with chicken). It was very tasty but would probably go with spicy next time. 4.5/5

We also had the pad gra prao with beef and it was absolutely perfect. It was spicy enough for me and not overly spicy to balance out all the flavours in the dish. I give a solid 5/5 for this dish.

The waitress was very patient and knowledgeable. The manager and other servers asked us how we liked the food. 4.5/5 for service.

I definitely recommend this restaurant (5/5)!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after hearing great reviews. We arrived around 9 that evening and were told we had to wait around 45 minutes to an hour. It was extremely busy and unfortunately you can't make reservations here. We just headed to a restaurant/bar nearby in the meantime until we received a call from the hostess. 

Once we were seat, we were squished beside another group on this long table, which was a little uncomfortable and awkawrd. Luckily the restaurant closes at 10 and we ended up being the only ones at the table after 10 minutes of being seated.

The food was great! I originally wanted to order the Khao Soi, but they were all sold out which was a little disappointing. I ended up getting the three flavours pad thai, which was great, but I found it a little spicy considering I only request it to be mild. If you can't handle spice, just be aware of the different levels they offer."}
{"text":"this place along with lotus of siam in vegas serve the best thai food i've had outside of thailand. dishes were on point, flavorful, and not overly oily or anything.

we had the panang curry, chef's special pad thai, pad gra pao, and washed it all down with some singhas. all were straight up delicious. get here early or put your name down and grab a beer somewhere else (like the town crier). 

good food, good looking people, and great location for tourists staying in downtown to walk to for a great meal."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The host was extremely rude and would not let my boyfriend and I sit side by side, it's extremely noisy inside and we could not have a proper conversation sitting across the table. We left the place before ordering and will not return again."}
{"text":"I've had some mixed feelings about Khao San Road but have been convinced again!  It used to be my favourite restaurant but when the Chef left to pursue her own ventures the quality went way down.  They hosted a tasting event where every single menu item was garbage, so I didn't go back for about a year.  Thankfully, they've put the effort back into their establishment and are serving up the great food I originally came to know.  Their Khao Soi is incredible, you can still get the street style Pad Thai (get it nice and spicy!) and their basil beef is dependable.  I wouldn't take kids just because it's always so packed and you often will need to share a table."}
{"text":"When a non-Thai comes up to me and says they know a really great Thai place, I usually give them a look of exaggerated doubt. I'm Thai and grew up on authentic street style food and won't settle for less. On this occasion I had to eat some humble pie with my amazing meal. 

This place has the best basil stir fry outside of Thailand. Everyone I have brought here is blown away and like me, became a regular. It's always crazy busy, and is casual dining with others at the table if you don't mind that. I tend to get take out now to avoid the queue, but still call it in an hour in advance.

If you're prepared to wait (and it is worth waiting for), then you have to try this place. You could always give your number and find a drink nearby to pass the time."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come to Khao San Road for a while now, since it opened a few months ago. I was disappointed last week when I tried making a reservation on a Thursday night for the next evening only to find that they were fully booked. So, this time I called on a Wednesday and was able to get the last spot for Friday. They warned me about their reservation policy: they won't seat you unless your entire party arrives and you lose your reservation after 15 minutes if your party hasn't arrived. I felt this was reasonable given how popular this place is.

There were four of us on this visit and since we were starving, we decided to order 2 starters and 4 entrees for us to share. We started with the Po Pia Pak Sod Gai - Fresh rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves and Thai basil, served with our tamarind, garlic sauce topped with peanuts and Thai coriander ($6). This came with 3 rolls which were cut into bit-size pieces. This was a great way to start off the meal - very refreshing and tasty!

We also ordered the Goong Taud Samoon Prai - Garlic Shrimp breaded in a crispy garlic and fresh kaffir lime leaf coating served with a sweet and tangy garlic sauce ($9). Another perfect starter. They came out hot, as they just came out of the fryer. They were really crispy and not at all greasy. 

As for our entrees, we went with 2 noodle dishes and 2 curries. We ordered the Pad Thai (Sam Roas) - Special Pad Thai \"three flavours style\" topped with home-made roasted peanuts, dried chili and a fresh slice of lime. We really enjoyed this and was certainly more authentic than the ketchup-y goop served at many other restaurants. 

We also ordered the Pad Kee Ma - Stir fried rice noodle with fresh green chili and fresh garlic, long green pepper, bamboo shoot and Thai basil leaves. I was surprised how good this dish was. When it first came out, based on looks alone, I didn't think this one would be as tasty, but again, this was another amazing dish. Be warned though, this dish was very basil-y, so if you're not a fan, I wouldn't recommend it.

As for the curries, we ordered the Gaeng Kaew Wan - A unique Thai curry dish known as \"GREEN CURRY\" that uses fresh green chilies to make a curry paste which gives its greenish colour. It was a very subtle green colour (unlike the kind I make with the little packets I get from Loblaws...). This was nice and didn't taste too heavy. I really liked the bamboo shoots that came with the dish too which gave it a bit of a different texture.

We also tried the Gaeng Massamam - The only Thai curry with a twist of tamarind sauce and cooked with onions, peanuts, potatoes and bay leaves; topped with crispy deep fried shallots (with beef for $13). My dining companions enjoyed this curry better, but I preferred the green curry. But don't get me wrong, they were both fantastic. Each curry dish came with a serving of rice. We found that there wasn't enough rice to soak up all the curry, so we had to order another serving.

When the entrees first arrived, we didn't think there'd be enough food as the portions weren't enormous. But surprisingly as we started plowing through it, we realized this was more than enough for all of us. Since we were all stuffed, we ordered just one serving of the only dessert on the menu, the Sa Koo Ma Prao - a personal cup of small tapioca pearls in sweet coconut milk with strips of tender young coconut ($3). This was enough for each of us to take about 2 bites. I was surprised to find that it was served hot. I think I would've preferred it served chilled as it would've been a nice refreshing end to the meal. Despite this, we all still enjoyed this. 

The problem with going to such a hyped up restaurant is that the expectations are so high, that some of them can be a bit of a let down. Khao San Road was certainly an exception. We all loved it! Everything was delicious, from start to finish. I will definitely be back for more!

Things to keep in mind:
- they take reservations, so take advantage of this!
- for the entrees, you get a choice of chicken, beef or shrimp
- you also get to choose the spice level of your food (we ordered medium for everything, and as a person who can't eat super spicy foods, this was very manageable)"}
{"text":"The food and overall ambience were decent. I'd say their food was on par with other well-known Thai restaurants around the city (e.g. Salad King). However, the managing staff were unnecessarily rude and abrupt when my friends and I dined there on two occasions. For instance, I simply asked our server whether I'd be able to return a Thai Iced Tea that I found to be too, too sweet. She hesitantly took it away. A few minutes later one of the managers came to speak to me about \"the drink.\" He was shocked that I had wanted to return it after taking a sip from the straw. I am not sure how else I would have been able to tell it was too sweet? Anyways, in the end, I took it back and let the ice melt to dilute the sweetness  and drank it \"to-go.\""}
{"text":"This has been my to eat list for quite some time, and finally I got the chance and time to enjoy this with my Mom and younger brother. Its actually not that far from where I work as well, and I always crave great Thai food... When we arrived around 1ish there was two ppl waiting, and we were the next but got seated before them....SWWEEETTT!!!!

The menu is very simple and has a picnic style table. We started with the Garlic Tofu which is deep fried with a sauce to dip. Its nice, crispy and tasty without really needing the sauce I find.

My bro ordered the Pad Gra Prao which is minced meat with holy basil and rice. This is like traditional minced meat with rice, but with a bit of a better flavour taste than usual.

My Mom got the curry of the day which is red with chicken. I find they don't have good seafood selection. The curry was nice tasting with strong taste of coconut broth. The rice portion is not that big.

I got the Chef's special Pad Thai which is elevated taste and a bit different from the street style. My Mom said it was quite salty for her, but when I taste this dish, it taste more sour if anything. Not overly sour, but enough to get you drinking your water often. Not to worry, because I got their famous Thai Ice Tea!!! It was quite sweet tasting, kind of a bubble tea flavour at times, but quite refreshing. The glass was quite big, but for $4.5 it should be considering they add quite a bit of ice as well. 

Although the portions all seem not that big, we ended not finishing and packing the pad thai which is quite surprising. I believe I will come back again for this joint to have some Thai since its not that far from my work. 

Bill came up to $52 before tips...

Is it the best? It ranks pretty good, but I'd say there is better out there Yelpers!!!"}
{"text":"When they first opened the line up was out the door and down the street.  I used to walk past it all the time on my way to work out and wondered what the deal was.  There wasn't even a sign outside and there still isn't one.  

I finally decided to try this place out when the line up wasn't too bad (we went early) and I'll say it was definitely worth the wait.  The restaurant has a nice homey feel to it.  Not like all the other Aisian restaurants opening up that look like they all had the same decorator.

I've eaten here several times and the food and service are consistently great.  This is one of my favourite Thai restaurants.  It's authentic and delicious.  The food is flavourful and awesome.  I've tried everything on the menu and can't decide which is my favourite!

Will definitely eat here again.   Sukho Thai is great too but I prefer this place overall."}
{"text":"I waited outside for 20 mins, and it was defiantly worth the wait. The food is so authentic, and flavours are very good. I love the cocnut dessert, I came here with my mom who lived in thailand for a year, and she also reccomends this place. One thing that I could have had without was their \"special ice tea\" I thought that tasted werid, but it could be a hit or miss."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype and the long line-up. I was disappointed because I expected it to be better than what it is, what with the slightly higher pricing, all the line-ups and good ratings. Taking all that into account, neither portion nor quality is amazing. Service was good."}
{"text":"The all time best thai food i've ever had. When I moved to Toronto I had heard that the international food was going to be great. I just had no idea it was that good. I had the red curry and the fired squash fritters to start. Loved every bite. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars it the wait. It took forever to get a table and while we were waiting we had to stand outside in the cold. As well, the wait staff looked a little overwhelmed. Otherwise the best thai ever!"}
{"text":"delicious Thai food - I like the curry there and it's not expensive.
However, the thing is they have the same food in lunch and dinner but different price. Dinner is a lot more expensive and you have to wait in line there."}
{"text":"Very lovely Thai food. The place is always packed at lunch and dinner hours. But I assure you, the wait is worth it and the curry (red curry to be exact) is phenomenal. If you're wondering whether or not this restaurant is over-hyped, I can assure you that the food is authentic and will leave you feeling extremely satisfied. I've traveled to Thailand a few times and while I wouldn't compare KSR's curry to local favourite places in Thailand, it is definitely one of the best that I've come across in Toronto! 

Bonus for unqiue decor, super friendly and helpful staff, and overall great ambiance for friendly gatherings!"}
{"text":"I finally get to try this place, after hearing / reading people talking about this place. 

We came on a Thursday night, around 9pm, didn't have to wait, which is amazing. 

It's only the two of us, so we ordered what people recommended on yelp

Gra Bong (squash fritters)
Khao Soi
Street Pad Thai

in my opinion, the Khao Soi is a bit too heavy for me, it contains lots of coconut milk. It taste good the first couple bites, but it's too filling for me. The pad thai also taste good, I definitely like the pad thai more than khao soi, even the Khao Soi is more unique at the restaurant.

I have been to a lot of Thai Restaurant, and I know if you go for Thai food, you can't think of eating healthy, but still, this place is a little greasier than other thai places, which are just as good. 

I would come back only if I don't need to wait in line."}
{"text":"I love this place. Delicious pad thai. If you can handle heat, order it extra spicy.
Just be prepared to wait no matter what time you show up."}
{"text":"So good! And worth the wait! Shared the squash fritters, red curry and khao soi. They were all so delicious. Wish it was a slightly larger space, but they fit a lot of people in without it feeling too packed. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night the place was PACKKKEEDD! it took us 1.5 hours to get a seat for two.  We ordered the Gra Bong (squash Fritters) - were tasty very light and airy kind of reminded me of eating a funnel cake but made out of squash  the sauce was good spicy with a nice pungent lemongrass taste.  The only thing was that  the fritters came out cold  ... maybe its suppose to be like that?  it was good but i think it would of been amazing if it was hot. 

The Green Curry Gaeng Kaew Wan was very creamy  with a strong coconut taste it would been nice if it was a little spicier.  Over all the taste was of the curry was good too bad the chicken wasn't cooked in the curry ... the curry flavours just didn't seep in to the chicken ... sure it coved in the sauce but they are totally two different things.  

Finally we had the Chef's Special Pad Thai (sam Roas) - over all the pad thai was great the noodles were cooked perfectly the only thing was i tasted the sweet and sour but there really wasn't any kick too it.  maybe cause we ordered the mild version. 

overall the food was pretty good here I would come and eat here again if i don't have to line up.

Oh forgot the service here is pretty good. the host and waitress are very nice and professional.  I know a lot of places when they are that busy and smashed they end up being frustrated and jerks but this place had some great service."}
{"text":"Tons of reviews, and the majority really hit the nail on the head. Khao San Road is absolutely my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. You're not going to get over-buttered, over-sauced, over-sweetened dishes. To be honest, just thinking about the food makes my mouth  water and it's 9:53 am!

The only thing that more fussy customers would have an issue with is the ever-present line-up. But, with incredible, SUPER affordable food - there's going to be demand. And for the demand, it's a small space. Bottom line is that it's worth the wait.

The service and staff are awesome; casual, friendly, not completely in-your-face and have great energy.

FOOD FEEDBACK:

I've had the Pad Thai (Sam Roas) - which in my opinion is THE best pad thai I've had in the city. Just perfect. The Khao Soi (beef), Gaeng Kaew Wan and so far anything I've had off the menu is KICK ASS delicious. The spicy-meter is bang on and gives a kick with awesome flavour.

For appies, I've tried the Tao hoo Taud Samoon Prai (fried tofu), Gai Taud Samoon Prai (fried chicken nuggets - to die for), Khao greup goong (shrimp chips) - totally not a fan of these, but my friends love 'em, Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw (YUM-MY!), Gra Bong (i like).

You won't regret giving this place a shot. Guaranteed."}
{"text":"Went there on a yelp adventure, and the food was great, when we showed up the host directed us to the bar even though there were a few open tables that could have sat us.

We had the shrimp chips, tom yum soup, and fresh rolls for as a starter, and two different types of curry, and the pad thai. the food came with the perfect timing, and great service. the counter tops were metal which added a metallic aroma to the food, which was a little distracting, but the food was good. 

by the time we left the place had a very big line up outside, and we had a hard time navigating the sidewalk."}
{"text":"Do not go here!!!! When I first walked in on a weekday around 5 pm it look fairly empty not many customers in the dining or in the bar area. I let them know it was for me and a friend and they told me to wait outside until my friend came!! Outrageous and disgusting service right ? But it gets better. So I said ok my friend will be here shortly can I sit at the bar.. And the hostess refused to let me sit there stating that it will be unfair for customers who want to come and sit because I am waiting for my friend and they can't relocate me to the dining area when my friend arrives  and that the bar is only for single dining. She did mention something about serving me a drink in the corner but not at the bar. Very inhumane and disgusting service and extremely not accommodating either. When I asked for the name of the manager apparently the hostess herself was the manager. Looks like you will also be stuck waiting outside or in the corner with a drink in your hand if you decide to go there and your friend hasn't arrived yet. Will never recommend this place to anyone after its poor service ."}
{"text":"Restaurant is pretty small and inconspicuous so it is easy to miss and you really have to keep an eye out. Waiters must have thought I was a wacko for wanting to eat here despite having absolutely no spice tolerance but were extremely patient and helpful. Most of the menu items start at mild due to the use of curry but luckily I was able to find some menu items that were not spicy. The mango salad, three flavour pad thai with chicken and pad gra prao with pork were all not spicy but delicious. One thing I didn't like too much is that it is a bit hard to differentiate between customers and staff at this restaurant. Only some of the staff have aprons on top of their casual clothes while others are dressed so casually that they look like they are one of the customers. Try not to be too confused when someone who looks like another customer walks up to your table and asks how your food is."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good - my favourite are the pad gra prao and bangkok style pad thai.

If it was only the food, I would definitely give it a 4 star. However, the lack of a reservation system and not willing to give you your table until your entire party comes, is just annoying. I don't think it's good enough to justify the long wait times.

Just make sure your whole party is there. There was one time 7 of us arrived first...a friend arrived 20 min late and they would not let him sit down and asked him to leave. I thought that was pretty rude."}
{"text":"My first time. The Panang curry is incomparably delicious! At first bite, it felt like my head was going to explode while some of the obvious flavors such as curry, coconut milk, fresh kaffir lime leaf and Thai basil burst all over my taste buds. It's going to take a great deal of restraint for me not to eat here everyday. Thoroughly enjoyed! Great service!"}
{"text":"Great food.  The special pad thai is fantastic, tofu, chicken its all great.  While this place is great its always a little too busy which will leave you waiting for a table or even just for takeout."}
{"text":"So good. We made a reso, which was the right idea with such a small place. Had the garlic breaded shrimp, which were delicious, and the green curry. It was the perfect portion size, and totally made me realise how fake tasting some of the other Thai food I eat is! Will definitely come back and will definitely recommend Khao San Road."}
{"text":"Food was nice but bugs hovering under lights and falling onto table. Had to replace water because of a kamikazee bug."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is about...and the long line ups. Good food but definitely nothing to write home about. Can't justify the wait and the less than comfortable seating."}
{"text":"One of our favs out of the multiple great restaurants we tried in Vancouver!  We ordered tons of different items based on the other recommendations and they came out quick!  Everything 'twas great and we knew we were in good spot when the newscaster we had been watching an hour before came in, couldn't get a table but did get take out!  Staff was warm and friendly!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Not every Thai restaurant does pad thai right but this one does! My favourite dish was their deep fried tofu (an appetizer). Delicious!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food in town. If you can get in! The key is to come in a smaller group or just two people is even better! Seatings are rare and precious to fit a big group will be a big wait! And if you want in even faster? Sit at the share table! They won't seat you until everyone in your group has arrive so keep in mind and be considerate! 

First order their bucket drink (if you want to relive your thai vacation/full moon party) or Singha (if you're a thai and know your stuff) or for non alcoholic try thai iced tea. It's a must! 

Order their fritters they're the best! And thai papaya salad because it's awesome and it's like crack for Thai food addicts. 

They have really good Khao Soi but do not order this if you do not like sweet or rich food. Their curries are great but go spicy! It's great! 

Anything on the menu is awesome but the best thing is the Phat Kha Pao (Thai basil on rice with fried eggs) it's like our national dish in Thailand. The best! 

Tip: ask your server please do not just order pad thai it's sad. Or order from the black board behind you. Those our their specialities which means they do it well and you won't be wasting your money!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Spot on! Only got the chance to try take out while I was in town as the place was always packed for dine-in! But in my 4days there, I visited twice! Definitely want to come back and try their squash fritters when I have time to wait for dine-in."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but quite expensive. Their pad thai doesn't taste like the cheap pad thai from the food courts."}
{"text":"Some of my very favourite thai food in the city and really appreciate the separate vegan menu! I've had great luck getting a table despite not being able to make a reservation, and usually just try to stop by about 20 mins before I'd like to eat to get my name on the wait list."}
{"text":"Sukho Thai got all dressed up and moved into a much pricier neighbourhood. 
I like it. 
Awesome meal in a very lovely space. 

To start, I had the squash fritters (as did almost every other table in the restaurant). It's essentially deep-fried squash, which look like they'll be quite greasy, but they're quite light and so tasty. I recommend. 

For my main, I had the red curry.  I think the red curry is the exact same dish from the Sukho Thai menu but with a different name. Anyway, it's my favourite red curry in the city, so I definitely wasn't disappointed (although a bit of a squash overload at this meal). It's served with huge chunks of squash, tofu, and red pepper in a spicy sauce. (Note: I got medium spice and it was spicy - so choose your spice level wisely). 

Our service was okay. It was a bit slow, but the restaurant was just starting to get quite busy for the dinner rush. The decor is gorgeous - very minimalist/modern. I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you can, most of the tables had reserved signs on them when we arrived."}
{"text":"They open at 5pm for dinner service and I walked in with a small crowd that had gathered earlier waiting. I was there for take-out and my order for 2 Pad Thai and a Khao Soi was probably the first to go in. One of my Pad Thai was chicken ($15) and the other shrimp ($2 more). To my disappointment when I got home, both orders were chicken! I felt ripped off! On top of that, the 'mild' Pad Thai was spicy while the 'spicy' Khao Soi ($15) tasted milder than the 'mild' Pad Thai. I tried calling them, twice in fact, but couldn't get to speak to a person. This is my first and last visit to KSR."}
{"text":"Found this place near the hotel I stayed. Chef special Pad Thai is Ok with good portion (take out). However, I asked for added tofu ($2 extra) but it was not there. I called back but was not even offered an apology or refund. 
Again, for the food, it is decent but might not worth the line or $$."}
{"text":"Very good food. I just wish it was easier to get a seat."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the staff is really friendly, but it's crowded and service is a bit rushed--I know that they need to keep the tables moving, but it felt like as soon as we looked even a little like we were done, our waitress was by with our bill.

That aside, the food was incredible and portions are generous enough that I managed to get a second meal out of my order of khao soi. Their spice ranking is really something--I ordered my meal Thai Spicy and I could definitely taste it, but that's actually on the low end of their spice scale.  I can't imagine what a really spicy meal there is like!  The place's reputation for good, authentic Thai food is well deserved."}
{"text":"This place was very good. Waited about 30 minutes before sitting down but the food was great."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants.

I always order fried squash fritters but unfortunately, sometimes it is sold out at dinner time.

I love green, yellow and red curry all.
Actually I have been visiting there for few years but I have only ordered the curry because I go there when I want their curry.

We have to wait always so long time and at outside but I do not mind if I really want to eat Thai curry and squash fritters except extreme cold winter."}
{"text":"I love Khao San Road. They have the best Thai food in Toronto hands down. Everything here is delicious and service is quick which means I can come in on a working day, grab a quick lunch and still make it back in time."}
{"text":"Spices are a bit too strong for my taste. Waiting times are usually long. Staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome 3 spice pad thai! I wish this place took reservations."}
{"text":"This place is overrated.  We started with fresh rolls and squash fritters.  The most unique part of the starters was the tamarind dipping sauce.  3 mains were ordered: green curry, pad thai and khao soi.  The khao soi was great; the braised beef was tender and the crispy noodles gave the dish different texture from the egg noodles.  The pad thai and green curry were also decent.
However, my biggest peeve with this place was inconsistent service.  I came with some girlfriends on a Friday night and expected a wait which I didn't mind; however, their website clearly states that they no longer take reservations but upon arrival a table was clearly marked reserved.  When we were seated at the bar which was not ideal for conversation, our bartender/server didn't take our drink orders until 15 minutes of being seated.  After our order was taken, the surrounding patrons which arrived after us had their starters and mains before ours arrived.  When our food finally arrived 40 minutes later, our server/bartender realized without apology that one of the dishes was entered in wrong.  Overall, I would only recommend this place for take out at the lunch prices (cheaper than dinner)."}
{"text":"Again, I'm mentioning this first in my review because it is so hard for me to find restaurants that aren't vegetarian or vegan that are able/willing to make sure I'm dining safe. 

Khao San Road has a gluten free menu and they take the mention of Celiac seriously. Not to mention that this is some of the yummiest Thai food I've had in the city."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best thai restaurants I've ever been to in Toronto. Food is amazing and many of their dishes can be made vegan. The Thai iced tea is one of the best drinks ever, and nicely compliments the spicy dishes they serve.  FYI: be prepared to wait for a table as the place does not have enough room to accommodate it's popularity."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on a weekday, arriving right at 11:30 and got a table straight away. Within half an hour there was a line out the door.

I started with the Gai Taud Samoon Prai - Fried chicken coated in garlic and kaffir lime leaf with naam djeem. These were okay, nicely crispy coating and not greasy, but a few pieces were enough.

The main arrived very shortly after delivery of the chicken, I understand that they need to keep things moving but a bit more time with the starter would have been good.

For the main I had the Chef's special pad thai, I asked for the spicy version. This was very good with some depth of flavour and good balance between the savoury, sweet and sour elements, however the spice level was not really what I would consider spicy. I really liked this dish and would order it again, but would ask that the spice level be amped up a bit. 

Overall this was a good experience and I will return the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great Thai food!! Love their curry noodle esp:)
I visited over five times this place since last year but almost every time, it's packed already. So highly recommend to go before 6 then, you won't face the loooong line up."}
{"text":"The best Pad Thai I've ever had. It's a bit of a hole-in-the-wall with a wait at lunchtime. And worth it."}
{"text":"My go-to in the neighbourhood. Consistently excellent. I almost always get the Three Flavours Pad Thai and a mango juice. This place is always busy so you'll feel a bit rushed, and maybe a bit crowded if you sit at the bar like I do, but service is always friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"This is my favourite thai spot in the city. I really really love the Pad Gra Pow and the Khao Soi.  Nothing but good things to say about this place!"}
{"text":"Rude staff, overpriced, watery curry.  

Pai, Thai Princess and Sukho are better.

{"text":"Walking the empty streets of the old entertainment district, its hard to believe that a restaurant like Khao San Road can exist. It's literally in the middle of nowhere, nothing else on the block worth going to (or even open), yet only a short walk to bustling Queen Street West area.  

Made a reservation for my brother's birthday last night. Arrived at 7pm, table was waiting (for 5 of us). The place was rammed. Line-up at the door (at least 15 people), every seat in the house full.  I guess being named one of the best new restaurants in Toronto really helps business 

Food

Server came over after about 10 minutes to take our order. We ordered two appetizers for the table, Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw ($6) , fresh rolls stuffed with homemade chicken sausage, lettuce, carrot and mint as well as Gra Bong ($9), large squash fritters. Also ordered two Chai Nom Yen ($4.50) or Thai iced-teas with condensed milk. Both appetizers were really great, the addition of the chicken sausage in the fresh rolls added an amazing smokiness. The squash fritters were not something that I would have ordered (thought they would be dense and greasy), BUT they were also very good, light & airy, not greasy at all. 
For mains I had the beef Pad Gra Prao ($13), diced beef with basil, spiced served on a bed of sticky rice with a fried egg on top. I'm a sucker for anything with a fried egg on it. Very good, though not the best thing ordered at the table. My favourite item was Khao Soi ($13) with braised beef. Spicy, creamy coconut curry with tons of beef, egg noodles,  crispy noodles, green onion and lime. It was amazing, could have eaten my meal and an order of Khao Soi. 

Service

Alright, I don't want to sound like a Debbie Downer, but service was very sloppy. First of all, the place was understaffed. You cannot run a booming restaurant with one bartender and three servers. I realize that the place is small BUT it really just created a ton of inefficiencies. Food came out at an okay speed, took about 15 minutes for appetizers, then another 15 to 20 for our mains. The servers were struggling to stay on top of their tables, I witnessed at least two tables wait over 20 minutes for their tables to be cleared of dirty dishes and have their bills delivered. The tables could have been turned over, there was a constant line-up at the door for our entire meal.  With another two servers on the floor, the place would have run much smoother and more efficient. 
We had a major screw-up at our table (yet I cannot entirely fault our server due to the business of the restaurant and lack of communication between the employees). We brought along cupcakes for my brother's birthday. Half way through our meal, we witnessed our cupcakes being delivered to another table. With a birthday candle. And singing. We flagged down a waiter, who realised the mistake, but it was too late, the girl at the other table had already blown out the candle. Obviously we weren't going to eat cupcakes that some random girl just blew on. Our server and the server that delivered the cupcakes felt terrible (she overheard that was the girl's b-day and assumed the cupcakes were for her). Why her friends' didn't stop the situation before the candle blow-out, I have no idea, OBVIOUSLY no one in their party brought  the cupcakes.

Anyhow, our server straightened everything out. They comped my brother's meal as well as gave us a gift certificate for $40 to cover the cost of the cupcakes, which satisfied everyone in our party. Again, I can't help to think that if the restaurant was properly staffed, this wouldn't have happened.

So overall: super great food. Service issues, but you can't fault a restaurant with so much buzz. Four Stars for the food, 2.5 for service."}
{"text":"I came here twice. First time had the street style pad thai and the second time I had the minced meat with rice and an egg. I enjoyed the second dish mush more than the pad Thai. 
  
As an app we had the Fritters and they were alright. 

The pad Thai portion is really small. 

When I ate the minced meat dish I had pretty bad diarrhea - which is not fun. That was the only food I ate that day so I know it was that.  
 
Was charged a dollar extra just for having an egg when it's included on the menu. 

A friend had the Thai style tea and that is amazing. 

There were also some mosquitos around our table and we were sitting near the kitchen. It was hard to eat with those flying bugs around. Also this was January why are there mosquitos in January, strange.

All in all I think this is a cool place to eat because it's pretty cheap but I'm just worried about the diarrhea, which makes me worried about the quality of food I am getting."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing, hands down the best Thai food around. This one one of the only places where their Pad Thai does not taste like ketchup poured all over noodles. It has a distinct sweet taste. My favorite is the Street Style Pad thai. The other style is also good. I usually order the squash fritters, they are delicious with the dipping sauce. 

The only thing is you must come early or wait a long time in line. It is always worth the wait, but you must be patient, sometimes you have to wait outside. 

Price is reasonable, although it could be a bit cheaper. My chicken and shrimp Pad Thai comes to about $15 plus tax. Squash fritters are $9 (for what it is, that's pricey).

My next stop is Suko Thai, the other Thai restaurant own by the owner's parents."}
{"text":"Amazing food that tastes like it's straight out of Thailand. Exceptional ingredients and service. In a city full of terrible Thai restaurants and takeouts this is one of a handful of Toronto's finest. I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"After returning from Thailand we were craving some authentic Thai food which is quite hard to find but Khao San Road hit all the right taste buds! 

My only complaint would be that we felt rushed.
Within 15 minutes of having our plates cleared when we were done eating, we were asked if we would like anything else, if we would like our bill, and then if we were ready to pay our bill. I understand that due to the small space and long line it is inconvenient to have people sitting for hours but enjoying conversation with friends is part of the pleasure of eating out which we couldn't do once we were done."}
{"text":"I waited forever in line. The only thing that kept me there was the craving for curry and not having the energy to find somewhere else in the area. We waited so long that we made friends in line. One of our new friends swore by the khao soi, saying that he came back time and time again for that dish. With a recommendation like that, how can you not comply? What a disappointment. It was a gooey yellow mess of drenched noodles in a sweet curry sauce. 

Having heard so many rave reviews of this restaurant and having waited an eternity to get a cramped seat at the bar, I expected more. Flying to Thailand to go to the real Khao San Road would have probably taken less time and frazzled nerves."}
{"text":"Delicious! You have to wait a bit, and show up with your full party in order to get a table but the food is worth it. Service is good and quick. The pad se ew was tasty and made with the authentic wide noodles that are impossible to find at Thai restaurants these days. 

There used to be an amazing Thai place called The One Thai on yonge near Gerard which is no more. This place is comparable. 

The menu is small. I wish they had some other appetizer options, and maybe Thai spicy noodle or a basil stir fry. The sweet potato fritters are awesome!"}
{"text":"One of the good thai restaurants in the city. The squash fritters and pad Thai are a must! I have always loved everything on their menu. Be prepared for the wait line outside. I recommend eating at khao San road specially if you're with friends and don't mind some noise around yourself :)"}
{"text":"The service here is mediocre. That said, the food was so good I came back a day later after the first time I tried it.

Tried Thai iced tea, gra prao, pad thai, massaman curry, rice salad. Everything tasted absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that Sukho Thai was opening up a new place in the entertainment district.  We arrived just in time to be seated without a reservation.  The place is a nice space which is much bigger than Sukho Thai with some shared family seating style.   It's definately cozy and a great date night place.

We ordered the Beef Khao Soi and the Pad Thai Street Style and it was delicous.  I don't normally order beef when I'm out but whatever they do to their beef has me hooked!  

One reason why I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the service.  They are really great people but extremely slow.  So don't go here if you've got somewhere to be after dinner.  I've heard that the chef is meticulous so perhaps that's why it takes a while.  Hopefully, this will resolve itself as they get it going.  Either way, I love this place and I often dream about their Khao Soi!"}
{"text":"If you like Thai food then your going to love Khao San Road. As authentic as as your going to find this side of the pacific. Amazing."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and came to Khao San Road at 5pm on a Friday night.  Arriving early was a good thing because the restaurant was full and there was a lineup of eager diners by 5:15pm.  The food was as promised, delicious, fresh, nicely spiced.  I had the Pad Thai with shrimp which lived up to my expectations.  There was plenty, it was spicy and flavourful.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect from the beginning til the end of the meal. I love the street style pad thai and the green curry. It was incredibly good!! Their deep fried squash was good too, lightly fried and not too greasy. The service was very good, they know how to welcome and to serve customers. I definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Thai restaurant in Toronto, hands-down. It's been my go-to for Thai in Toronto since they opened. It's busy, loud, and happening, but always well worth the wait. If you don't like to hang out for an hour in the freezing cold 50% of the year then consider showing up at opening (5:00PM on most days).

Best dishes are the panang curry (BEST I've ever had), khao soi, squash fritters, and massaman. Very good and complex flavours, and overall just plain yummy.

Also get the Thai iced tea - perfect balance of spice and sweetness. Not drowned in sugar or condensed milk like every other place."}
{"text":"i know this place doesn't really need any more endorsing...107 reviews and counting!! but oh well, i thought i should still add my 2 cents.
loved it. truly authentic thai! this is from someone that spent 12 years in thailand - so you can trust me. :-)
the basil chicken (pad krapao) was soooo good! it's actually prepared with minced chicken - the real thai way! 
i also recommend the massaman curry with shrimp - heavenly!
loved the squash fritters too.
hands down this my new favourite thai restaurant in toronto."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Very tasty-- not a big fan of pad Thai (usually too sweet), but this was really flavorful. 
Cool vibe too. 
Long line on a Wednesday evening. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Canada. Amazing and satisfying food esp for the price. Drinks are good too. Nice crowd to have your meal of seated at the bar."}
{"text":"I get take-out lunch from Khao San Road every couple weeks. The service is extremely quick and the food is excellent. I'm vegan, and they're very accommodating. They always take extra care to ask if seafood/egg ingredients are ok to include, which I appreciate. They've also got a cool gluten free menu! Makes dining there hassle-free for us folks with specific needs!"}
{"text":"Two words: Khao Soi.  Delish!  You will wait in queue for a table but the door seems organized and once seated the service is great and the food is fantastic.  Love this place.  Best Thai in T.O.!"}
{"text":"This is a small cute restaurant located in downtown. You might even miss it when walking by. We went on a weekday around 6 pm and it was so packed that we ended up sitting at the bar. That was quite uncomfortable and made it difficult to eat since I kept bumping elbows with person next to me.
We started with the garlic shrimp as appetizers. Quite tasty and crunchy. For the main course, we both ordered Khao Soi beef and chicken.  Very few Thai places serve Khao Soi so I was determined to try out this restaurant since everyone raved about this dish. The Khao Soi was delicious and the best part was that you could adjust the spice level to your tolerance level. The chicken Khao Soi was very oily though and I did not enjoy that part. The beef one was less oily. 
Overall I would definitely go here again. All the food looked delicious and I would love to try some other dishes from the menu"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Probably best Thai in Toronto.  Service is a hit and miss though. Don't go if ur super hungry because you will probably have to have to wait minimum 30 min..and I've waited as much as an hour."}
{"text":"4.5 out of 5! Definitely the best Thai food in the city! Recommend the Pad Gra Prao and green curry! $$"}
{"text":"Overrated by most Yelpers. Service is ok ! Ambiance is ok ! The curries are not as good compare to those that served at Lime Asian Cuisine at Yonge & Eglinton. Menu setting is a big loser!!
Joanne Kates is the worst food critic in Toronto ( STOP PRETEND TO BE AN EXPERT IN ASIAN COOKING, YOU KNOW NOTHING! NOTHING!)"}
{"text":"Good, pretty authentic food. Mix of urbanites, professionals in an urban vibed setting. Wish they did offer other thai beer such as Chang rather than just the standard Singha. Somewhat expensive at 15 bucks for a dish."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Thai restaurants to go for lunch. I'm gonna have to join the bandwagon and say that this place is just fantastic, because it just is. It's close to my office and I always ritual it with my co workers, and we're never disappointed.

I usually order the Pad Thai or the Pad Gra Prao, both of which taste pretty fantastic. You can choose your protein and your spice level. Warning: for those who can't or don't like spicy food, DO NOT go for 6 or anything above. I order 6 spicy level for pad thai and pad gra and die everytime (but I personally love eating spicy food, haha)

This place is usually packed with people, lunch or evening, so make sure to arrive early and get your taste of the kitchen. Highly recommend 5/5"}
{"text":"I've been to Khao San Road a couple of times now, and it's always really good.

They've changed the menu recently, but the Pad Thai is still pretty darn good. Although, the Bangkok Style one has dried shrimp in it. Not my cup of tea, but it was still really good nonetheless.

As always, be prepared for a wait, and definitely don't turn up starving. Our wait time (party of 3, arriving at 6:30 on a Saturday) was 1 hour. But they have a great system of phoning you when your table is ready so that you can grab a drink down the road while you're waiting.

It's definitely worth the wait, just be prepared for it!"}
{"text":"Gist
An authentic Thai taste with a hipster ambiance. 
Wait time for seating is between 30-60 minutes, but it lives up to the hype. 
I've tried majority of Thai restaurants in TO and this is as good as it gets.
I use Khao San to benchmark other Thai joints. I'm still an optimist that there's always someone else out there who could be better but have yet to find. 

Best Dish to Try:
Khao Soi - this is a unique dish not found at many shops. I did try them at 2 other shops, and was no where near as flavourful. 

For those with less adventurist taste buds - the Pad Thai is a good pick.  It is noticeably more flavorful than the crappy red stuff you get at other Thai joints. 

Best Drink to Try:
Thai Iced Tea - only for those with a sweet tooth, but this blend of ice mikly sweet tea is like having desert. If you're having a spicy dish - this will complement well to sooth the burn.

All other dishes are quite good,

The curry is very good but i wouldn't call it the most remarkable curry ever. 

I've been following the owners of Khao San since their days at Sukho Thai. The food at Khao San isn't the only thing remarkable, they have a great attitude and authentic desire to care for their customers and STAFF. Jeff & Nuit are two of the warmest people will meet - they are humble, honest, and passionate making people smile with their food. They don't seem to ever compromise on these values - anyone who has followed them from their modest shop in Regent Park will agree. 

What more could you ask for, great food and when you're a customer, you support great owners who treat their staff and patrons well."}
{"text":"This place has definitely slipped since it opened. The chaotic system for waiting for a table is never a great start. 

The food quality is medium. The squash fritters are great, if they arrive hot. The noodles are good but portions are on the smaller side for the price. 

If you like this kind of food, Sukho Thai is a better value."}
{"text":"I came and I conquered! Felt adventurous and decided to have \"top spicy\" for the spiciness level of the minced beef with kaffir lime leaves. Boy! Was that ever flavourful till the next day :D The joy of running to the bathroom while at AGO. I had come last year and had the same dishes. Mainly, fresh rolls (or toothpaste rolls) as my good friend calls them. Khao soi, red curry, street style pad thai, thai iced tea.

Definitely coming back! As I need to try the squash fritters and get my fresh roll fix before departing this lovely city."}
{"text":"This place is always a full house, no matter what time of day I choose to grace them with my presence. It's probably because of their food. No wait, it's ONLY because of their food. 

I'm probably the millionth person to recommend this trio, but the fried squash fritters, beef khao soi, and Singha beer is the bomb dot com. Portions are 'thai-tanic', and I never finish everything (which is allll good since I can take the rest to go and enjoy it again the next day.)

Seating is quite cramped inside, and you're pretty much shoulder-to-shoulder with the party beside you. Service is just meh. I wouldn't consider Khao San to be a first date place since it gets super loud inside.You'll be too fixated on slurping up your noodles anyway."}
{"text":"Loved this place, this was the best Thai food I have ever had. I loved everything we got, (the squash fritters with the tamarind sauce, the panang curry and pad thai) it was amazing. The spices and meat and everything was cooked so well. It does get crowded, and there was a line up. You most likely have to sit really close to other people, but the customer service and food was amazing. I would recommend this place and go back in order to try everything on the menu! 
Just beware SPICY and spicy thai is REALLY REALLY SPICY!!! (Like sweaty head and runny nose spicy)."}
{"text":"excellent thai - love the signature dishes and thai iced tea."}
{"text":"A Five Star Thai restaurant that plays Hip-Hop. It sounds odd, but it works for the atmosphere and spicy food.  I ordered my food Thai Spicy, which was a 6 on the spice scale and not for the faint of heart at all.  It was amazing and my mouth was on hell fire.  I purposely did not mention the dish I had because everything here is amazing.  The people at my table all let each other sample everyone's dishes. Everything was top notch.  I do recommend being very modest with the spice level you order, because some people couldn't finish their dishes after ordering high up on the scale."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the wait to get a seat was long. After waiting for close to an hour we got a seat that was right under the vent and the lights. We didn't think much of it initially but after the food came, we had like 30 mosquitoes flying into our food. No other tables seemed to have this problem so I guess we were just very unlucky that we got the seat. However, we told our waitress about it and even showed them the amount of mosquitoes in our food, but they didn't even attempt to do anything about it except say sorry. Least they could do was redirect the vents after hearing the story... Seems like we weren't the first to have this problem either cuz she didn't not seem surprised."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent (I ordered Pad Gra Prow). I usually go to Salad King for Thai Food, and I had enough of it and wanting to find new Thai food. I went to couple Thai restaurant, and their food is more on the sweeter taste. Finally I found Khao San Road that can fulfill my need in savoury-spicy thai food. The only downside is their price is more on the pricey side ($20/person including tips), but it's okay if you want to treat your belly once in a while."}
{"text":"This Thai food might just be the best in the city! The line up is usually long but it's WELL worth the wait, the place is always busy and kinda loud but it's a great atmosphere,  you'll probably sit next to people you don't know but they're always friendly and sometimes even offer you a piece of their appetizer  to try. This place is a MUST TRY for any foodie!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food.  The place was packed on a Monday night.   

Waiter was great on recommending the most popular dishes from each of the categories - starters, noodles, curries, signature dishes.

Out of the recommendations we got the fresh rolls, three-flavor pad-thai and the signature dish khao soi. Both dishes were very flavorful and would highly recommend. 

Don't forget to ask the waiter regarding the daily specials.  I didn't see it until we paid but definitely would have changed my order since the special sounded delicious."}
{"text":"We went to their pop-up at Nana, 785 Queen W, last night. Service was good, flavours were there for the most part, but I did not like the look of oil (if it was that) floating on the top of my green curry, plus it was very watery... Pad Thai was okay. Would rather have a shrimp fresh roll over chicken sausage. Much prefer Sukho Thai (4.5 star). Won't be back for the Road..."}
{"text":"Been going here with friends a lot. Green curry and Khao soi are my two favourites. The lineup takes a long time so if you are tight for time try calling in for pick up!"}
{"text":"This place was packed with people in business attire, seems like a popular place for afterwork dinner.  The food was good, a bit different than the staple Thai places around the GTA which gave it that extra yumm.

The wait time was about 30 minutes at around 8:30pm and it was louder than a firing range."}
{"text":"One of the best tai places here in Toronto. My favorite dish is the fried squash and bankok padtai style!"}
{"text":"Overall, the restaurant is good but not great. Although we went for an early supper (around 5-6 pm), we had to wait in line for 25 minutes. Location is small, loud and the seating is quite uncomfortable. The green curry is flavorless and hotter than \"mild\". Didn't like their iced tea with condensed milk at all. Service is fast, but the food is a lil bit greasy."}
{"text":"The food was very good but not as good as other Thai food I've had in the city, though I love the atmosphere and service. The price was fair as well. I probably wouldn't go back as it's so busy and I am not one to wait in line for a restaurant, especially when there is other delicious Thai food in the city, but I understand why it's the best rated in Toronto."}
{"text":"Khao San is good traditional Thai. The food was very good. If you don't like spicy food then I would suggest to stay away from this. The food was not extremely spicy but it still had a kick. The taste of the food was very good though. When we went it was completely packed, it was extremely loud, so much so you couldn't have a conversation at a normal volume. But if you make a reservation in advance you should have no problem getting in. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Best Thai food that I've tried so far in the city! Great vibe, though it can be hard to get a seat. Definitely a must hit restaurant!"}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber Eats today so this review is for food only. I got a stir fry of ground beef and green beans with rice. The food was really tasty, lots of great flavour and the rice was cooked really well. It looked like a good portion too until I realized that the beef was just a small layer on top of more rice. For the price I expected a bigger portion. Lunch was good but having finally tried Khao San Road, I gotta say, I don't understand the hype. Maybe I need to visit the restaurant to 'get it'"}
{"text":"I just so happened to past by with a friend 30 mins before it opened and already had a line. I've been meaning to try it with all the recommendations so I figured EH WHY NOT. I was definitely not disappointed, so was my friend. The only con I can think of is the rice portions. 

Would line up again!"}
{"text":"I had the mild noodles, but had bits and pieces of everyone's food and they all tasted awesome! Our server was great and very friendly. A bit of a slow service but to be fair it was a crowded day. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome, authentic, great environment, and reasonably priced!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My gf and I visited Toronto from Detroit and found this place on yelp.  There was a line out of the door so we placed our name on the list and came back an hour later. I ordered the three flavor pad Thai and she ordered Khao Soi, some type of curry soup with beef. My pad Thai was the perfect spice and quite honestly the best I've ever had. She couldn't talk much during dinner bc she was in love with her dish.  The staff was super friendly and it had a unique eclectic atmosphere.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Second time here.  Arrived about 8:15 pm on a Monday night, got lucky and got a table for 4 as soon as we walked in.  

We did the squash fritters as recommended by fellow yelpers and they were great.  Not what I was expecting -- sort of a light lace quickly fried.

Tom Yum Kung was the soup of the day - spot on - with a nice heat that sneaks up on you.  I'd have to say it was spicier than the \"medium\" mains we ordered.

Pad Thai Shrimp had a fantastic umami flavor - so addictive.  Panang curry chicken and Panang curry beef were tasty.  We ordered them medium and didn't think they were overly spicy.

Looking around, the staff all seemed engaged with the customers, and everyone was having a good time, so I'm surprised at some recent negative reviews regarding the service.  Service was quick and efficient, ice cold Singha always at the ready, plates cleared promptly.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"My friends joke that I only moved to get closer to this place - they just might be right! A perennial favorite - their street style pad Thai can't be beat! I'm so excited that they're now open on Sundays. Beware that there's almost always a line up... But once you're in its totally worth it!."}
{"text":"I love the food here and while Khao San Road can get super crowded, the quality of ingredients in top notch. The last time I visited, I shared a plate of the pra grad prao and topped with with a fried egg. A wonderful choice. Everything tastes better drizzled with runny yolk, especially when it's combined with chili, garlic, and basil. We also enjoyed the Bangkok-style pad thai. Flavored with tamarind, shallots, chives, fish sauce, peanuts, and lime, this was easily some of the best pad thai I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Having a Thai Aunt, I can be very fussy when it comes to Thai food. The food at Khao San Road was mostly up to par. The first time I went, I had the Pad Gra Prao the first time which was lovely. It was spicy and tasty. A little oily, but still good. 

The second time, I tried a curry and it wasn't the best I've ever had.

The atmosphere of this place is great. I've sat at tables and at the bar and both times the service has been fantastic. It's a chilled environment and a really enjoyable place to have a meal."}
{"text":"Walked here from hotel, at night. I ordered \"to go\" once I got to the restaurant. It took a minute to figure out the protocol to do that. \"Uh, a little help here please.\" The place was jam packed with people at tables and others practically begging to get on \"the list\" as it was close to closing time; there was loud music, a lively atmosphere, waitstaff hurriedly shuttling back and forth through the crowded space. Once I finally placed my order inside, I went outdoors to sit and wait. The host was funny and accommodating. About 20 minutes later the host brings be my order: red curry w/tofu + veggies (spicy), rice, garlic shrimp appetizer, and squash fritters. 

Back at the hotel, I wanted to wait until the hubs got in from work but the food smelled so good. I figured I'd just have a taste. Errgh, the food was too good! I had a whole serving of the curry and rice. Yumm, thick kabocha heaven in that sauze! I wish I had had them also add shrimp; it was a great combination of sweetness, spiciness, and pungent flavors. The squash fritter was good. I didn't eat the garlic shrimp until later. It was still tasty lukewarm. My husband finally came in and ate. He didn't care for the fritters but loved everything else agreeing that the red curry was tops."}
{"text":"We ate at this funky little walk-down for the first time last night, and already it has leaped to the top of my list of favorite Thai spots in the GTA, sharing honors with Salad Thai, the tiny gem in Oakville. 

Genuinely friendly and attentive service from both management and staff. No attitude or impatience despite being a very popular spot and insanely busy on a Saturday night. We came in cold off the street with no reservation, and the warm, accommodating host accurately predicted a one-hour wait for our table for three, then seated us promptly as soon as space opened up.

The house music is contemporary with a driving beat, appropriate for the lively, bustling ambiance and the minimalist, casually modern decor. We were seated at a table in the back, directly under a speaker, which was fine until the decibel level took an abrupt leap when a new track started up. This might have ruined our evening, but the staff responded quickly and cheerfully to our request to turn it down--and then actually left it down through our entire meal, a bonus. The overall  noise level was fairly high but even, a background wash of chatter and clattering cutlery.

The food:
I like things moderately hot spice-wise; the others in my party prefer from no to mild heat. Our dishes arrived accordingly, as ordered. Big plus.

Chai Nom Yen
This is Thai iced tea and is supposed to be sweet; it was. I was served in  a huge glass: very, very delicious and refreshing.

Fresh Rolls
Our least favourite of everything we ordered. In combination with the sauce, I found them a bit overwhelmed by the flavour of raw garlic. There were also big chunks of some ingredients inside, as opposed to delicate dices and juliennes. By no means bad, but not up to the level of everything else we had. Salad Thai does these much better.

Squash Fritters
A big hit with all of us! Rather than solid, doughy balls, these are airy creations, rounds of battered squash shreds that seem to have held together by magic in the deep fryer.

Street Pad Thai
My wife ordered the shrimp version, and she says it was the best Pad Thai she can ever remember having. Can't wait to compare it with the Sam Roas Pad Thai next visit!

Khao Soi
Although I ordered it with chicken instead of the recommended beef, it was still fabulously good. A deep bowl of flat noodles and protein choice garnished with crispy noodles and green onions, then generously filled with a subtly fragrant, creamy yellow curry with the consistency of a light cream soup. This dish is all about that sauce, and when I order it again, I will be sure to include a side of jasmine rice and mix some in at the end.

Green Curry Chicken with Rice
This has long been one of my \"acid test\" dishes for a new Thai restaurant, and Khao San Road nails it. Fully on a par with Salad Thai, and that is high praise. Like the Khao Soi, this dish is all about the fabulous, richly fragrant sauce, which is thin, lightly colored, and slightly creamy.

No room (or time) for the dessert. Perhaps next visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavourful pad thai!! I have only ever done take out but every time it has been delicious. Expect a long wait every time because it's always packed but if you plan a head you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant in the city. Luckily it's really close to my work.

Quick note to start us off: arrive early or expect to wait! The restaurant is quite small and very popular. I'd suggest arriving at 11:45 or earlier for lunch and 5:30 for dinner. You could try to make reservations, but they never seem to answer their phone.

Now too the food. Incredible. I can't even form sentences. I'm going to give you random points:
-- very fresh
-- bold flavours
-- made from scratch
-- best pad thai I've had in the city
-- non-whitified spice levels
-- try all the apps!

And a few non-food related comments:
-- chill and friendly servers
-- cool decor

Keep doing what you do KSR. Hopefully in a bigger space sometime soon."}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars for my first visit here 2 years ago: It was simply awesome, the pad thai was the best I've had, the ambiance was great and the service was quick! However, the experience kept going down a notch every time I went there afterwards, until recently I decided to remove it from my own \"favourite restaurants list\" after they misplaced mine and my mom's order, kept us waiting for 1 hour and served us some very dry and overcooked noodles...We were almost late for our show and had very unsatisfied stomaches! I hope it's just a special case and not indicative of their real standard nowadays! Just because you are popular doesn't mean you can ignore food quality and services!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Khao San Road for a very long time, hearing raving reviews and seeing amazing photos all over friends Instagram. I finally got to try it this weekend as a little birthday dinner with a date. 

Now I can't remember the exact time we arrived but was told that it was a 30 minute wait for a table, we gave the hostess our name and number and decided to walk around looking for another restaurant should a table to readily available elsewhere. Extremely glad we decided to come back after going to The Keg and being told it was going to be a 45 minute wait.

The first thing I noticed after being seated as that all the servers and kitchen staff were Thai, one thing I believe really makes a restaurant stand out. It's like going to an Indian restaurant and having all Russian kitchen staff (not saying that Russian people know how to cook Indian food, but it just loses it's authenticity to me) The staff all spoke Thai to each other and I loved hearing it!


We started with the Papaya Salad, and am so glad we did, the flavors were very authentic, fish sauce with lime and bits of dried shrimp through out. I decided to go with the Khao Soi after hearing so much about it on Yelp and Instagram, and my date had the Three Flavors Pad Thai. The Khao Soi definitely lived up to it's expectations! I ordered it with medium spice, which was perfect for me, I like spicy, but not lips-burning-snot-dripping-down-my-nose spicy. I probably could have handled the next spice level but I kept in mind that my date cannot eat very spicy. The Khao Soi came with egg noodles and chicken in a golden curry sauce topped with crispy noodles. The addition of the crispy noodles really gave the dish that extra umph, you get the chewy noodles with tender chicken and crispiness with every bite! The pad thai is definitely one of my favourite pad thai's I've ever had. It was the perfect consistency, not dry, but also not too saucy. The flavor was just right, sweet and slightly sour from the tamarind and lime, topped with peanuts. I would definitely order this dish again when I go back. While waiting for our food, we noticed one dish that was constantly coming out of the kitchen, after asking what it was we were told it was Squash Fritters, seemed to be quite a popular dish and will definitely try it next time.

Overall rating:
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 5/5"}
{"text":"After trying it on 3 occasions to give it a fair shot I can safely say its a huge let down.
Bad service, didn't have half the things on the menu and honestly nothing like the old khao san which was our go to thai place."}
{"text":"The \"green curry\" was amazing, but tear-inducingly spicy for \"medium\"!! Bangkok style pad thai was okay, but too sweet. The wait time is out of control, though, had to wait an hour for a table for two for an early weekend dinner."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place last night after being impressed by all the amazing Yelp reviews as well as by the level of detail and customer care demonstrated on the restaurant's website. We were told there would be a 45 minute wait for a table, but we were seated in less than 25 minutes (at the bar, which had surprisingly REALLY comfy stools!!).

 I had the panang curry and my bf had the pad phed pha - both with chicken, both at the 'spicy' level option. Both the dishes were really good - my curry sauce was light and devoid of that horrible heavy, stodgy texture you can encounter in lesser-quality Thai places. I had a sample of the pad phed pha and it was bursting with flavour! The portions don't look huge but on closer inspection, the amount of chicken received with the dishes was really generous. The presentation of our and everyone else's dishes was mouthwatering!

The hostess and some of the servers were a bit surly, but the guy serving us behind the bar was amazing! He gave us free samples of the Thai Iced Tea and was really relaxed and friendly. 

Although I enjoyed my food and appreciated the freshness and quality of the ingredients and preparation, I wouldn't say there is anything particularly revolutionary about this place. I'd go back again, but I really didn't enjoy the wait time for a table and then the half hour wait for the food after being seated. It's not a complaint, as obviously the wait times are due to the popularity of the restaurant and the attention to detail in preparing the food, but personally, it wasn't the most relaxing or fun way to dine on a Wednesday night. If I lived closer I'd definitely be a regular for take-out, though!"}
{"text":"Things started out on funny terrain. First we jumped from the line to the bar, and then back to the line when we were told it would only be two minutes for a table. Then, we got our table! All this moving around was my fault- I'm happy to eat at a bar generally, but Khao San is actually very, very well lit, and I like to take my notes and pictures in stealth. Sitting at the bar would mean complete visibility of what I'm doing to the chefs and servers! Have I become so paranoid? The table was better for conversation anyhow, though it was just as bright with a big lamp hanging down directly over us. I appreciated the change from some very dark and intimate restaurants I've been to in the past.

There was some kind of squash shortage in the kitchen. Two of their appetizers, khao greup faktong (squash chips) and Gra Bong (squash fritters), weren't available, which was disappointing since they both sounded very good.
While we mulled over this hiccup, I had the Chai Nom Yen ($4.50), or Thai iced tea. It was sweet and bright orange, the flavour reminding me strongly of Rooibos, but with the tartness of black tea also. It was pleasantly thick from the condensed milk, and I appreciated it even more when I got my main, which was on the spicy side.


Since all the squashy apps were out, the only vegan thing left was the Garlic Tofu ($8.00). It came, the big nuggets heaped and plentiful, their panko-crust glistening with hot oil. The garlic smell was strong, and we were hungry, spearing the golden lumps on forks (for there are no chopsticks at Khao San Road) and dicing them into the sweet and tangy chili sauce provided, burning our mouths in eagerness before deciding the slow down and let the things cool off before causing more pain. There was an almost cheesy, Parmesan taste in the crust, but I didn't find it very garlicky. The smell was stronger than the flavour, though it was present. The tofu was firm and satisfying, and there was lots for both of us.

Willie had the Gaeng Kaew Wan Tofu (Green Curry, $12), and I got to try some. It was VERY good. The coconut milk base was extremely rich and sweet, penetrating right into plentiful, firm tofu chunks. They were not shy with vegetables either, full of mushroom, onion, and....squash? Yes, the squash had returned! But this sauce was probably made before the shortage of gourd. Or maybe it was a different variety. Well, it tasted amazing and heavily of basil. Even at 'medium' the curry was spicy. Thank goodness for that coconut cream!
I suffered gravely from entree envy. My Pad Gra Prao ($13) was not the knockout I had expected, even with my all-encompassing love of egg. I think what I really wanted was something with a different kind of texture. The oil drizzled beef was minced very fine, like ground beef. Served with crumbly, fresh rice, the texture was basic and comforting, but not what I had wanted (should have got noodles!). Everything quickly was mixed together, and the creamy egg yolk made it all sticky and salty, with the kind of creaminess you only get from droopy yolk. The beef itself had spice and tamarind sweetness, which has a quality like molasses. Shrunken holy basil looked more like thyme nodules, but kept its strong basil taste. There was a lot happening in the dish, with herbs, chilies, tamarind all fighting for attention. All were defeated at last by a peppery sharpness!
At Khao San Road, the portions are generous, and we were left satisfied, maybe even overfull. There was no room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good Thai restaurant in T.O. for a while and I have found it. Khao San Road. Great down to earth atmosphere in a pretentious area of the city. The food is really good and crafted by a chef I believe who actually has Thai roots. It's a husband a wife team who run the restaurant and they do it well. On our visit we tried one of their curries but also a new Thai dish I've never had (Khao Soi) which is just unbelievably delicious. Price points are not outrageous but be prepared for the long line ups. For all the downtown folks, they do take out so that is a solid option."}
{"text":"The best. 
I ventured out here because Kent told me to! It was totally worth it, I met the owners who are charming and passionate. I ate a few things I had never tried before and was very surprised, I really enjoyed everything I ate.

 The space was very clean and had an amazing energy, cool communal tables, but I find sitting at the bar is always best! 

The waitress was especially great!

Ill be back soon!"}
{"text":"Other reviewers have mentioned this but let me say it again ... this place gets busy and quite loud when it gets full. But it's worth it. Excellent/tasty food, prepared well, good prices, and generally fantastic and friendly service, even during the rush times. Recommended, even  when elbow-to-elbow with people you've just met (because they're at the table right beside you)."}
{"text":"A very tasty Phad Thai, great albeit loud atmosphere. Be prepared for long lines to get in on a busy night. If you live close by and it's Friday night, you might want to order in! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"A really popular spot.
Ordered mild green curry. The bamboo shoot is fresh.  The fish is super tender. The curry has a taste of coconut and milk. Together with the rice, which tastes really nice. 
But overall, I didn't really into it."}
{"text":"Easy place to miss even walking by, but once you inside the place has a casual, university style atmosphere.

I ordered the Three Pad Thai (Chicken, Average Spice).  I was delicious, and for me the spice was perfect.  You definitely will taste it and it enhances, but not over powers the meal.

A definite recommend, 4 out of 5 stars only because it's my first time here."}
{"text":"I went to Khao San Road for lunch today. The hype did it justice. 

We got garlic chicken, fresh rolls and garlic tofu to start. The garlic chicken and tofu were coated in Panko crumbs and deep fried. (I was surprised as I had imagined they would be sautéed dishes from the name) Both the garlic chicken and garlic tofu were great! It came with a sweet and sour sauce and was perfect when you added a bit of hot chilli sauce to it.

I got the Three Flavours Pad Thai with chicken (medium spicy). It was a good sized portion for lunch. I ordered hot sauce on the side so I could add more on to my Pad Thai.

My friend got the Khao Soi. It is a traditional Thai dish that consisted of golden curry with egg noodles, crispy noodles and scallions. To be honest I found it quite heavy and would have ordered just the golden curry and rice on the side. There was way more curry than noodles.

The restaurant itself was surprisingly not as big as it looked from the outside but it was a decent size. 

I will definitely go back when I'm craving Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've had in the city after spending a year in Thailand. Service is good but you could wait for a bit. Would recommend !"}
{"text":"Food is good but service was much too slow. it was so slow that the menu promised \"crispy noodles\" which really were just soft. I bet it was prepared and just wasnt brought out so the \"crisp-ness\" got soaked away. Seriously, besides that I've never waited 45 minutes for a pad Thai. so unless you're prepared for some unattentive French-style Thai dinner, I suggest away. by the way, service wasn't that great, had to ask 5 times before we got two glasses of water."}
{"text":"came here with the wife on a Saturday night, the place was packed, but front desk really took care of business well. Wait time was expected so no points to deduct there. Food was unbelievably flavourful, makes me never want to set foot into another Thai Room or Thai One On ever again!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars. 

Came here for dinner with the fiance tonight. The first thing I noticed was the several empty tables with a line of people waiting. I gave my name to the host and he asked me if my full party was present and I said yes.  He then told me that we would have to wait. I didn't understand the reasoning for having empty tables and seats when I was obviously present with my full party. It was almost like we were waiting for the sake of waiting.  We didn't wait long and in the end, we ended up having to share a table which I didn't mind too much until the guy sitting next to me drank my drink! 

We ordered the fresh rolls with chicken sausage to start. My first bite was overwhelmingly full of mint. In fact all we tasted was mint! It detracted from the taste of the chicken sausage or sauce. It was that overpowering! We ended up having to take the mint out of each the rolls for it to actually be enjoyable.  

We ordered the khao soi with braised beef and pad thai (street style) with chicken as entrees. The pad thai was good and had a nice citrus flavour. The khao soi was delicious. It was a yellow curry with a great coconut milk flavour making it super rich and creamy. The braised beef was good and not tough at all.  The dish came with noodles (egg noodles and also deep fried noodles as a garnish). We felt that there was not enough noodles for the dish and there was an overwhelming amount of curry such that it was almost like soup.  We ended up getting some white rice to go with the dish.  The white rice worked really well with the curry...in fact, the curry went better with the rice than with the noodle.  

Overall, I liked khao san road but would not order the fresh rolls again and would honestly just want the khao soi with rice instead of the noodles (if possible)."}
{"text":"Fantastic curries and thai dishes in a really cool laid back atmosphere (although very busy).  Love their squash fritters too!"}
{"text":"I had waited AGES to finally get into this restaurant. It's always busy, and people are always lined out onto the sidewalk. The food was good! Decent prices too. It was good, heartwarming, authentic Thai food. My only problems were two-fold: the staff is a little dismissive and pushy, plus the seating is a shared-seating / bench style setup -- so you basically have to eat with strangers (and your back has no support). Overall, it didn't blow my mind, but I'd go back."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday. Can I just say this is THE BEST thai food in the city?!?!! And it was busy as hell. But oh so very worth it. Must Try the Pad Gra pow - so delicious! Service was as good as you get at such a busy spot. Didnt get to try any drinks - not sure they had any. The girls loved it. We Will be back, Very soon, possibly tomorrow."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I had the Vegan red curry Thai hot, which was very delicious. My co-workers had Massaman curry with chicken which they loved as well.
The music was quite loud, but the food and service definitely deserve 5 stars. I will be back when I get back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Love this quaint (may have to wait) but buzzing Thai eatery. 

The food is great and the atmosphere is very upmarket Thai: sharing tables and eating close to other people with an upmarket finish and styling. The food is great and as authentically  enjoyable as Thai food can get (it can be a bit extreme for unaccustomed palates).

Avoid on weekend nights if you are not prepared to wait for a table. Definitely worth it if you are very keen for some good Thai!"}
{"text":"Magnificent! Make sure you order the Khao soi, it is one of the most incredible combination of tastes one can experience.
This is one of the few places that does spicy properly, be very careful how you choose."}
{"text":"Decent food. Okay service, a little slow. Serious acid reflux inducing chicken curry!"}
{"text":"Pure Awesome
Can get pricey though.
I went with a group of friends and we sampled a lot of their dishes.
So it got pricey that way."}
{"text":"DON'T EVER GO HERE ON A FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT. 

We arrived at 6.30pm on a Friday evening, by that time it was already an hour wait for a table of 3. We were fine to wait, it's a sign of a good restaurant! The host assured us that she would call us in 50 minutes, allowing us 10 minutes to get back to the restaurant. One hour and 15 minutes later, no call, so we headed back to the restaurant ... the host had accidentally given away our table to another Anna. Realizing her mistake, she gave us the next table available, problem solved, we were still in good spirits. 

The server took 40 minutes to take our order thus we only ordered mains. The table next to us ordered right before us and they had starters, mains and paid their bill before our food arrived. We asked the server how long the food would be and she seemed annoyed that we asked, I guess she's asked all the time, and she just said \"soon.\" At this point we were starving. We were like WE'RE NEVER COMING BACK HERE, blah blah blah..... But when the food arrived we forgot about our grievances. 

It's was the best Thai food I have ever had. My green curry was epic. I wanted to hate the food by the end because everything else hadn't been great, but the food was unbelievably amazing and, I can't believe I'm saying this, well worth the wait! 

Food - 5 stars
Service -  1.5 stars
Vibe and decor - 4 stars"}
{"text":"After traveling to Thailand several years ago I never thought I would enjoy thai food in Toronto again.  Enter Khao San Road.  While still not the same fresh flavours I enjoyed on the beaches of Ko Samui, Their pad thai rocks the house, and their other menu items (limited but good) are certainly worth a try.  Make sure you get the right \"spicy\" for you - you don't want to blow your brains out, but if you want to risk it, the option is there..."}
{"text":"Love the Pad Thai! Crispy shrimp is delicious. The waiting time is about 30 min unless u beat the rush and arrive Before 6pm for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing!! So I would try to go early as the wait can get pretty long.  But they do take your number and call you when your table is ready, so just plan for that and go get a drink near by.  The squash fritters and khao soi with beef are to die for. We went with a large group and everyone loved their food, so I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on this menu. The servers were very attentive, and the girl on the door is awesome, no matter how long the wait she is way to cute to get mad at. We will definitely be back and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Food is exceptional!
The curries are on the heavier side (taste great but make you feel kinda ick when you're done)
The pad Thai is amazing!!
Staff are okay, tend to be on the rude side when they are busy. 
The first come first serve policy is annoying as we've had to wait around for almost 2 hours for dinner once. They tell you they will call you so you don't have to hang around but it's deterred me from eating there on multiple occasions"}
{"text":"Love this place! The wait takes forever but the food is delicious; my favorite Thai in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best thai food in Toronto...... Pad thai and curry are always great, and I just adore the pad gra prao. Of course don't forget the Singhua! I really enjoy the energy in the restaurant, and don't mind the noise at all. The wait has (obviously) gotten longer since the place first opened, but Jeff is very accommodating and tries to seat everyone as best and as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Toronto.

After visiting Thailand last year, I became very particular about my Thai dining experiences. No longer able to stomach the westernized menu at places like The Friendly Thai or the like, I was thrilled when I discovered Sukkothai on Parliament, and even MORE excited when I learned the owners had opened up a sit down spot on Adelaide.

Word of advice: Make a reservation or you will be lining up out the door to get a table, even on a Wednesday night.

Another word of advice: their street signage is almost non-existant, so make sure you jot down their street address (or use Yelp's Google GPS map!) to find the place.

Last night we (myself, my cousin and a friend) ordered the Green Curry with Chicken, Pad Kee Mao, and Pad Thai (Sam Roas). From the first bite we wanted to cry it was so delicious. We'd ordered them all spicy, but not \"thai spicy\"  -- and thank god for that, for as it was the heat made my friend Andrea say her ears were ringing (note: she still ate every last piece).

KSR also serves up ice cold bottles of Singha, although for $6 its a far cry from the 80B you'd pay on the actual Khao San Road. Still delicious, and it made the meal perfect.

Andrea topped off her meal with the tapioca dessert, which while tasty was a little too cloying for my tastes. Nicki, also ordered the Chai Yen -- an interesting concoction of tea, spice and condensed milk.

SO GOOD. I can't wait to go back!
Am already planning my next visit!"}
{"text":"Huge let down. So so so disappointed! I love Khao San.. no more. Salty food, recipe not the same. Never coming back.
Go to PAI, that's where chef Nuit Regular cooks, she is the brain behind the previous KSR."}
{"text":"Try their food with \"Thai Hot\" level of spiciness, it's amazing. Wait times can be a pain and that's where they lose a point."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Khao San for a while (a while being a year). I've even gone there two or three times, each time getting scared away by the massive line-up out the door because this place doesn't take reservations. Toronto weather in the middle of February + huge line-up = does not comprehend why everyone is lined up in the snow. But finally, finally, despite still waiting in line for half an hour to be seated, I tried it. And it was good. Just not good enough to justify the wait.

The place is packed, and loud. We got a seat at the bar (which is fine) but I kept getting jostled from the back by a lady who didn't know to keep her elbows to herself. Service was hit and miss, since there's so many people that the servers kept saying that \"they'll get back to us\" because they were in the middle of something. The food was admittedly quite good, and their portions were filling. 

Did I enjoy my experience? It was alright. Would I go back? Probably not. If you're not a fan of really loud, cramped spaces, then Khao San Road is definitely not the place for you."}
{"text":"Loved the khao soi - have tried it at other restaurants but none seems to compare. It's a shame that the line is always ridiculous."}
{"text":"I struggled writing this review.  The food was great, but the line up is obnoxious- not to mention you have a 4 square foot section to stand in to wait to be seated. I like my fellow Torontonians, but not enough to be all up in their personal space. 

We started with the Gai Taud Samoon Prai (crispy fried chicken) and Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw (fresh rolls filled with sausage and veggies).  The chicken had a hint of kaffir lime leaf and a delightful dipping sauce.  Crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside.  The fresh rolls were like nothing I've eaten before. Unique flavors and came with this garlic, tamarind, peanut sauce. 

The group I was with decided to order three entrees to share.  We got the massaman curry with beef, street pad thai with chicken and  Pad Gra Pra with beef.  All of them were cooked to perfection, seasoned well and served to us quickly.  The street pad thai is the funky, wild sibling of the regular pad thai. Totally worth trying.  

I really have no complaints about the food.  I'm actually quite shocked.  If this place were less crowded, I would definitely come more often."}
{"text":"Just stop reading reviews, and go here for Toronto Thai."}
{"text":"I like this place I'm just not a fan of the line ups. Come later at night when the line up is not so crazy."}
{"text":"Overrated, may have been a big deal initially but there's definitely equal or better thai food in the area, without all the fuss."}
{"text":"My FIRST 5-star review! Wohooo!

Hot-diggity, I've never been this excited to write a review about a restaurant before! I've been to Khao San Road about 6 times now and I'm honestly surprised I haven't written a review about this place yet. It's not a coincidence either that this place has a 93% on (the-name-of-that-site-which-shall-not-be-named-on-Yelp).......*Urbanspoon* =P. Anyways, let's get this started...

The Food: 5+
In my 6 visits, I've tried the Sam Roas Pad Thai. Garlic Chicken Fingers, Garlic Tofu, Squash Fritters, Pad Gra Prao, Thai Iced Tea and the exalted culinary masterpiece that is...(the) KHAO SOI. My personal favourites are the squash fritters and clearly, the Khao Soi (always with beef). The Khao Soi (compared to others I have tried) has a rich, thick, intensely flavoured and bright golden coloured coconut curry soup with the most tender, bite sized pieces of braised beef (and there's plenty in each bowl!). You can let them know how spicy you want it. For me, my rule is if you're not sweating...it's not spicy enough. But to each his own. I particularly like how the soup was thick enough to cling on to the noodles so that each bite was packed-full of the deep and rich flavours in this classic Thai dish. Unlike pho, I eat the noodles AND drink the soup in it's entirety. Why let a drop of heavenly bliss go to waste? The rest of the dishes are authentic and really good...but the Khao Soi is on a league of its own.

The Service: 4.5 
I have never been here when the place is not fully-packed. This may be a deterrent to some, but due to the fact that it's been a while since its opening and there's been enough time for \"fad-foodies\" (foodies who just visit places that are currently \"in\") to dissipate, my recent visit there shows that this place is legitimately awesome and is here to stay. It's also worth the wait since in my recent visits when they would tell me there would be a 15-30min wait, they would usually call us within 5-10 mins to say that our table is ready. It can be difficult to flag one of the servers down sometimes but when they get to you, they're incredibly patient and helpful with the menu and the food comes out quick despite how busy they get.

Ambiance: 5
Not an intimate place exactly but surprisingly for the small space and the large amount of people, I don't find it too loud. I've been there with 2-5 people at a time so it's a good place for a group as well (you might just need to wait a bit longer to be seated together).

Overall: 5

I'm so happy that I've finally reached the 5-star rating threshold. This is one of the places for me where I can confidently take family/friends and know that they'll have a great dining experience. Thanks Khao San Road!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best thai food in the city, but it comes with King West prices!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had the Bangkok style pad Thai and I loved it. The balance of the flavours is just terrific. 

I also tried the fresh made rolls as an appetizer and they were ok. So, if you are thinking on trying Thai food, I would totally recommend the pad Thai. The only thing to keep in mind is that it is possible you will have to wait in line for some time before you can be seated and a little pricier than your avg Thai place.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food:
Pad See Ew: tasty thick noodles. I personally prefer the no-spice version. I also tried it mild, which I found pretty spicy. Khao San Road's sister restaurant Nana also has this Pad See Ew dish and they tasted exactly the same.

Service:
This place is very busy and especially during weekday lunch hrs. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Packed, loud and noisy...it all adds to the er 'ambiance' and makes me want to filter out everything around me and focus on the good company and food. Do not go when feeling ravenous as you will most likely wait to get in and the hanger will take over (booo). Last time I went, I inhaled the three flavours pad thai...we also shared the squash fritters but for whatever reason it came same time as mains; but that was ok since it added nice variety in texture to the meal. Panang curry was decent but prolly skip that next time. I will say if I'm in the area, I'd prob frequent more but it isn't a place I go out of my way for since I'm not in the neighbourhood and the fact that there are so many great thai options in this city."}
{"text":"The only negative about this place is the location... It is close the club district and only 10 minutes walk from the financial district, so I would never \"go out\" to this restaurant so much as I would stop in on my way home from work.

That aside it is really reasonably priced and delicious thai food.  I had the Khoa Soi (braised beef, coconut cream curry spicy, with rice noodles.  It was a big bowl of spicy creamy deliciousness but next time I'd share this with someone and also order a less heavy dish.  Altogether one beer and one dish was $25.00 with tax and tip.

The YAM FRITTERS look amazing also.

What I like, and what you might not, is the big communal tables - enough space so my friend and I could talk about things like the terrors of pregnancy (we're not but afraid to) and budgeting, but also meet and talk to the people next to us.  

I'd probably come here with a group next time and try more things and share.

Really high quality thai food with good ingredients and no filler.

Note:  the curries are definitely made with both coconut and CREAM so know that if you are lactose intolerant or trying to diet."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to trying this place out for a long time now. Went just after it opened for lunch and there was no waiting. Ordered fried chicken and combo on the side. The chicken was really good with a sweet and mild sauce. The soup and fresh roll were better than most places. So far so good right? Well, the mains disappointed. Green curry was flat and street style pad Thai lacked flavour. 

Probably won't be back since there are better joints around town."}
{"text":"Really good Pad Thai (street style) - none of that fake red ketchup.
Green curry was good too.
Thai ice tea was abut too sweet and milky to my liking, but I really enjoy the atmosphere and the food was great!"}
{"text":"I tried to eat there with three friends. They wouldn't seat my friends until I arrived, but i was running late and they were hungry.  Because we had tickets for a show, I suggested they take the table for three and get eating.  The hostess said she couldn't guarantee a seat to be added on after.   So I then agreed that I would not go to the restaurant at all, and I would just  meet them at the theater.  I ate by myself near the theater - no biggy I'm good with that, but still they get a \"Wow... Thanks Khao San Road for a shitty friends night out. \" You guys are big time jerks and based on my experience with you which involves zero food, a decent rating of  \"Eek! Methinks not.\" is merited. Sadly, I'll never discover how wonderful your food is, but it probably won't be because your toxic energy only makes the food unhealthy.   I'm glad I didn't spend money there."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming one of my top 5 restaurants in the city, and I'm lucky enough to live across the street from it.

Big lines. And you can't even call in most of the time because their lines are tied up with other customers trying to do the same. While it can be frustrating, that's the sign of a restaurant that's serving up quality. Somebody should set up a bar next door for those who are waiting for tables.

I've had 5 or 6 of the main courses on the menu, and they all have their own distinctly delicious flavours. Thai food in general is so flavourful, but they take it to another level here. the Pad Gra Prao is probably my favourite, but I'll eat anything there. The other nice thing is that there's a wide range of available spice levels. I usually go Thai spicy, but if I'm feeling weak or particularly brave, I can tinker with that. Something for everyone. 

It's easy to miss this spot, but do yourself a favour and check it out next time youo're in the Entertainment District."}
{"text":"Service was fast, food was amazing and authentic. Was a little lowd/hectic but other than that great."}
{"text":"Marked 3 stars down for the terrible service and poor management. 

I've been to Khao San Road quite a bit by now, and no doubt they have good food, but I'm not coming back. The management is terrible and incapable of managing situations in nice and calm manner. 

As for the service, everyone at this place seems to have an attitude, and if you dare to ask anything from a waiter be ready to listen to a long lecture about their policy - how to prepare the meal takes ~40 minutes and we should be grateful to sit at their cold patio for 40 minutes, and they won't give you a menu after you ordered, because they don't want you to stay any longer, and, of course, the whole party should arrive at once for the same reason.

I didn't want to give in on this place and gave it plenty of second chances but every other visit was worse than the previous one. Too bad."}
{"text":"So much hype but failed to deliver.
25 min wait for only adequate Thai food.
There are so many better Thai restaurants in the area that have better food, better prices and I have never waited for a table."}
{"text":"went on a weekday for lunch with a friend and arrived around 12:00, we weren't expecting the place to be full though! but it did say something about the food here and it was torturous standing in a line smelling the aroma and watching others eat their food errr shortly after we arrived a line started to form behind us hahaha.. we waited for approximately 10 min before being seated. the service was fast and friendly and the hostess took care to refill my friend's water as she battled the heat on her tongue lol. i had the pad gra  prao with chicken and made it a combo and my friend got the three flavor pad thai combo. we both opted for medium spicy.  the roll was refreshing and the sauce was sweet and delicious, the soup was a bit spicy but very flavourful. the pra gra prao was soooo gooood too the flavour the meat mixed with rice mmmmmmm tho medium spicy wasnt enough for me.. will go for the next level when i visit again! i stole a bite from my friend's plate and her's was delish as well! oh and the hostess was more than happy to split the bill for us which made everything much more convenient! will come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"The food here is really flavorful and good but the wait is forever. My hubby and I came here for lunch on a weekday and waited 20mins for a table followed by 30mins for 2 dishes. Would have rated higher if not for the lengthy wait times."}
{"text":"I was at Khao San for a birthday dinner of 12 during the middle of the week.  Knowing the restaurant doesn't take reservations, we aimed to arrive for 7 and they were great at accommodating our large group.  We were seated on the \"patio\" which was essentially two long tables 6 per table.  The experience overall was great.  Khao San was buzzing with the sound of great conversations and laid back music.  The front of the house that helped seat us was very accommodating and friendly, servers were neither great or terrible, but I would ask for chopsticks when ordering the food as the place settings are fork/spoon.

I always keep in mind that one of the best ways to gauge the importance of  cleanliness to any establishment is to scope out their washrooms and the washrooms at Khao San (although very small and  bare bones) were fairly clean and well kept.  There are also sinks outside of the washrooms if you just need to wash up before/ after dinner.

With regards to the food, I would say that it was well portioned, fresh and well put together.  My table ordered to share family style the following:-Fresh Rolls-Squash Fritters
-Pad Kee Mao
-Chef's Special Pad Thai
-Red Curry
-Yellow Curry
-White Rice

Each appetizer and entree were great, but in my opinion, the red curry stood out the most simply because it had the most flavor and textural contrast.  The white rice was very good, perfectly steamed and had a nice bite which accompanied the curries very well.  

I can say from this past visit, I will definitely be recommending and coming back to Khao San even with the wait time.  A busy but efficiently run restaurant pushing very good fresh Thai food!"}
{"text":"I love the vibe here, the food and everything about this place. I think about the \"Pad Gra Prao\" more often than I should. Something about this place makes me feel like their is a little NYC cool in Toronto and yet it's Thai - some places just have that special something."}
{"text":"GOOD PLACE! Been back a few times just for the squash fritters, but the pad thais are definitely worth the wait as this place usually gets busy just after opening for dinner.  Get there early and you're better off. And order the squash fritters right away."}
{"text":"Ok I haven't been to Thailand so maybe all the Thai food I've had so far isn't authentic, but let me just say I've liked Thai food much better when it wasn't at this hyped restaurant. The red curry I ordered was too sweet and my friends weren't all too impressed with the Special Pad Thai and Penang Curry either. I'm glad we didn't have to wait in line though, because if we had I'd have been doubly disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, I always get the green curry. The portion sizes are good but one thing I dont like is they dont take reservations and its always packed.  I ate here today for lunch and I guess having a line up is a good problem to have, its better than the opposite.  Be warned if you go, you have to wait a long time.  Its best to order take out if that is an option for you.

The food is great, the reason I gave it a 3 is because of the wait"}
{"text":"The food was awesome. The two stars given are not about the food, but the quality of the service and the long wait-- the food wasn't awesome enough to make up for it!

We didn't wait long to get a table, maybe 20 min, but we had to share with two other parties. Normally this is fine but the restaurant was so loud my ears hurt, and my partner and I had to scream across the table at each other. Not cool.

Also, the shoddy service- the host seated a party that arrived after us BEFORE us (at the same table as us), and we waited OVER AN HOUR for the food. The manager or owner said it was because of the 2 parties that had arrived, but those parties each consisted of about 5-6 people. I would have understood if it was a huge party. Furthermore, they offered chips to the couple seated directly beside us but not to us. Really strange, considering we were seated there just as long as they had been.

Anyway, the food is nothing to complain about- delicious pad thai with good shrimp (compared to other TO Thai restaurants I've been to where the shrimp actually ruin the dish) and one of the better green curries I've had- but it isn't so out of this world that it's worth the hassle."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, full of flavour and just sooo good... I've tried almost everything on the menu and you really can't go wrong. The actual restaurant is laid back and has a friendly vibe and the service is quick and helpful when it comes to any questions. The only thing keeping this from being a 5 star is the price, it's a little on the steep side for Thai food but the food is so good that I'm not really put off.
All and all a great place to go for dinner"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Good service. Good Thai food, but not great. And certainly not outstanding."}
{"text":"I rushed to this restaurant when I learned that it has the same owner as Sukho Thai.

The place was cool and hip. Way better than Sukho Thai.

I only picked up the usual fare:

Pad Thai (Roas) is very good. Perfectly cooked noodles with sweet sauce and generous sprinkling of peanuts. It even looked better than Sukho Thai's albeit with smaller portion. 

The beef panang is almost the same. 

Tom yung goong is also good but Sukho's probably a bit better. Broth is not as rich but still flavourful. 

I can't wait to go back. 

Maybe I'll order from the 2 places and have a taste test."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants. So good! Love their noodle dish."}
{"text":"Food is good and service is good except they really want us out. My partner hasn't even finished his food and we already got the bill.  We waited patiently for our table, so I don't expect to get pushed out when we are not even finish eating."}
{"text":"Delicious! Overall the appetizers and mains are very good. Thai iced tea is on the sweet side but good.  

Must try : Squash fritters, pad thai, massaman curry! 

Cons: Wait times are horrible (1-2 hrs) during busy hours. Try to go during lunch or very early dinners.

Atmosphere: A great place to show a new friend in town, it's busy, trendy and happening."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Excellent presentation. Nice atmosphere. I will definitely return here when I am next craving high end Thai food."}
{"text":"So overrated! Waited for half an hour to get a table for 3. The food tasted ok but definitely not worth the wait and the price.

I don't know why they wouldn't expand considering that it seems to be very popular. Guess it's part of their business model..."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Regardless of the long wait, I have never been disappointed! Best Thai in the city!"}
{"text":"Even with the lines, this place lives up to the hype. 
We ordered the fried garlic chicken to start (very tasty, I actually prefer it without the dipping sauce)

We also ordered the green curry, pad thai, and khao soi. the green curry was great, but wasn't 'best Thai food in Toronto' great. However, the pad thai and khao soi make a pretty strong case for that title. 

My only issue with this place (nothing to do with the quality of the food, which is awesome) is their wait times and organization of the line. I understand that it is crazy busy but their 'system' could be refined a bit - however, the food is definitely good enough to overlook this.

Don't forget to order a thai iced tea"}
{"text":"This restaurant is everywhere on the top Thailand food lists in Toronto and it worths to have a try. The environment is really impressive but a little crowded. They no longer take a reservation so everybody has to wait in person. But it won't take a long time and it's rather quick.

For the food, we focused on the SIGNATURE DISHES part of the menu. The khao soi is said to be the must order of this restaurant. It's egg noodles with golden curry. And the pad gra prao is holy basil served on rice. Also recommand the thai ice tea which is really different."}
{"text":"Having been to Thailand before I can definitely say that Khao San Road has really hit the nail on the head with making authentic tasting Thai food in Toronto. My go-to is definitely the Bangkok-Style Pad Thai and I just love that they serve Singha beer. The portions are huge so make sure you show up hungry. The only downfall is that you usually have to wait forever for a table...but trust me, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great original Thai in cool and casual surroundings. Simple but fun menu at reasonable prices. Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We arrived just before dinner hours started and there was already a small crowd of people waiting to get in. Luckily we didn't have to wait long to be seated. Service was great, everyone was courteous and made sure everything was ok.

Before I start with the food, I must mention that this place has sinks outside the washrooms. BONUS POINTS GO TO YOU KHAO SAN ROAD. Bonus points lost however, due to the serious lack of space in the stalls.

Chef's special pad thai was very flavourful and as their menu described... sweet, sour and savoury. Chicken was tender and the lime juice added in was a nice touch. Had I looked more carefully at the menu, I would've gotten the veggie + tofu instead just to live life on the edge (just a little bit).

The second main we had was khao soi with braised beef. Khao soi is garnished with crispy noodles on top of egg noodles soaked in curry. I'm accustomed to curries that have a lot of coconut milk added in causing it to be very watery however this was not the case here; the curry was rich and creamy.

Thai iced tea was refreshing and very sweet. Like bubble tea but better.

The highlight of my visit is the gra bong which is fried squash fritters seasoned with other delightful ingredients. THE SAUCE. I have no words, only tears of joy for this magical sauce. There must be a level 99 wizard in the kitchen making this. Portion wise, gra bong is perfect if you have a party of 3 or 4. Highly recommend this appetizer... especially the sauce."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai places in Toronto.

I love their pad thais but my favourite has got to be their Pad See Ew. The thicker noodles are great and it really fills you up. I usually get the medium spicy one for this as the mild is too mild. The medium pad thai is spicy enough but depending on your tolerance level, you might want to stay at mild. I myself have a decent threshold so if you can't handle spices, best to stay at mild and get some of the peppers on the side.

Also, their dessert is really really good. It's super sweet but if you're craving for it, definitely worth indulging on!

In terms of the waiting periods, best to go during lunch or later in the evening but not after 9/9:15. If you are in a group of 2, it's easier to get a table vs a larger group just based on the seating layout here. But I'm a big fan so definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"For people who are wondering if khao San Road is better than Pai:
Noodle lovers: Pai
Rice lovers: Khao San Road

Have to try: Squash Fritters, Pad gra prao and Thai ice tea(for people who love sweet)"}
{"text":"This is the BEST Toronto thai restaurant. The wait is forever and they don't take reservations but it is worth it. Their 5 flavours Pad Thai is perfect (shrimp is always cooked well) and they have a beef and rice dish with fried egg that's amazing. The thai iced tea is awesome too. If you can't wait around for 2 hours, Sukho Thai is a good second.  This place has ruined all thai takeout/delivery places for me. It's just not the same."}
{"text":"This is ABSOLUTELY my favourite Thai food restaurant in Toronto. I've been here so many times and I never get bored from the food on their menu. 

I love the busy vibe and the tiny summer patio that opens in the summer. There is always a line up, but they make sure you are seated pretty quickly. I don't recall waiting longer than 30 minutes before on a Friday night (party of 4). 

For starters, I highly recommend trying fresh rolls, squash fritters and garlic chicken. 

For the main course of the meal, I tried different items from the curry, noodles and signature dishes. My most favourite is khao soi, which is from their signature dishes. They also have dishes that will accommodate vegan and gluten free diets. 

Can't wait for my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Interesting dishes for sure!  The place is always packed but my buddy and I were able to get seated at the bar within minutes (usually it's a put your name on the list and come back in half an hour kinda thing I'm told).

During lunch the noise is quite loud so it's not the best place to go for conversations.  Food was nice though so I'd go back."}
{"text":"Went in right for dinner service (at 5pm). My party had a baby stroller and unfortunately, the staff said there was no way a stroller could go into the restaurant - ok fine. The party sat outside, which we wouldn't have minded on a regular day, except there was construction outside and random splurts of water was sprinkling down to us from above. I had their Pad Thai and thoroughly enjoyed it. Although it's overpriced for the portion size.

Food: Good, would have liked a slightly bigger portion for that price. Spiciness level was not consistent throughout the dishes (we all ordered same level on Pad Thais, one was a lot spicier).
Price: $$
Service: Ok. The stroller thing and they sometimes forgot about the \"patio\" tables. It took a little while to get their attention."}
{"text":"Definitely hidden away, all that marks this little nook (for now, anyway), is a letter-size piece of paper with Khao San Road on the door, which is located just beside Ravi Soups on Adelaide. Thankfully, once inside, the food and interior is much more complete, and make for a perfect casual dining experience.

Service is incredibly friendly, and the food is delicious. Highly recommend the garlic shrimp - succulent, breaded, butterflied shrimp with crazy good flavour, and with 8 pieces at $9, this is perfect for at least 3 people to share. 

Next up were street style Pad Thai and one of their \"specials\", spicy chicken on rice (the name escapes me now). Portions were hearty (enough for leftovers), and the flavours were dynamic, but not too overwhelming. 

Bonus: we stuck around late, and the manager sent us dessert on the house - a coconuty tapioca dessert soup of sorts. Though just a bit too sweet for my palette, it was a creamy and warm capper to a relaxed meal. 

Having been open for just over a week, there are still a couple kinks they're working out. For example, fluctuating music volumes for their at-times odd music choices, some confusion with what credit cards they accept (not Amex, btw), and no hot water drinks (warm tap is the best they could do), but I'm certain these will be smoothed over in no time. 

When word gets out, count on this place being packed with the lunchtime crowd!"}
{"text":"Have been here more than a few times over the past year and was never disappointed.  The staff was always cheerful and the food fantastic.  The pad thai's and the curries were amongst the best I've had in the city.  After not having gone for a few months I ventured back a few weeks ago and was surprised to find a stark difference in the place I had become accustomed to.  The staff all seemed overly stressed out and the food, while still good, had definitely changed (for the worse, overcooked, ingredients didn't seem as fresh as normal) from my previous visits.  I'll still give it another shot at some point to see if that was some kind of off day, but it was really a disappointment."}
{"text":"Food is great.  There's nothing really to add that hasn't been said before about the quality of this place.  Not 5-stars because the wait time can be, and usually is, excessive - there should be options other than 'going early to get your name on the list.'"}
{"text":"The only downside is that they don't take reservation and on a typical night it is not unusual to wait 1hr+ to get seats. But the food is worth it if you have the time and your stomach can last that long."}
{"text":"I concur with the average score of the 100 other reviewers who have (generally) enjoyed this place.  To avoid repetition, I'll just stick to what my own impressions were.  The line was a tad ridiculous, though likely a function of its location and reputation.  I guess this speaks to the need for more decent Thai in this city.  As well, it was just really loud in here, felt like the being at the old Salad King, but hey, what are you gonna do. 

The green curry was acceptable (a bit bland, more curry paste needed), the street pad thai chicken was delicious, the khao soi chicken was worth the wait alone, and the fresh rolls were good.  If you haven't been, you should go.  If you have, then you know."}
{"text":"The food were alright but the service was suck. It seems busy even on the weekday so you dont have space to enjoy your meal. We rather eating in other Thai food for good service and nice asmospher than Khao San Road. Never going back."}
{"text":"Overall, Khao San Road offers the best and most authentic thai food in Toronto

This was my 2nd trip back.

Highlights 
- Food is authentic: the curry is light and the pad thai isn't overladen with sauce
- Everything is (or can be done) gluten free. Thai food is naturally GF friendly, but western adaptations have made it less so. Almost every Thai place in TO adds a thickener (wheat based) to thicken their curries

Lowlights
- Long wait times
- Prices are higher than most other Thai prices
- Rice paper wrap was bland (skipping next time)
- Fruit flies hanging around the paintings on the back left wall. It makes me question the cleanliness of the place a little bit"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Khao San Road over the last 4 years and the food has consistently been great. A nice lunch spot despite the long wait times.

If you're a big eater I would recommend ordering an appetizer in addition to entree."}
{"text":"I arrived for dinner at Khao San Road on a Friday night around 6. I called for reservations on the Tuesday, but was told that they were out of spots during the prime dining hours. However, they indicated that there'd be a number of walk-in seats available. I waited for about 30 minutes and got seated at one of their communal table.

I ordered: 
- garlic chicken appetizer
- panang curry with chicken
- khao soi with  braised beef (egg noodle yellow curry)

Although all items were delicious, I was disappointed with the panang curry. Perhaps this is because I am an avid Salad King panang curry enthusiast, and Khao San Road's panang is just not the same. 

Out of everything I ordered, I found the khao sao to be delicious and is a dish I haven't really had at any other thai restaurant before. It will definitely be ordered again!

Prices were really reasonable, our meal for 2 came out to about $40. In addition, there's a really cool vibe at the restaurant that probably starts with the fact that the waiters are really nice. 

Overall, Khao San Road was delicious and felt very authentic. I'll be going back a lot - they even do take out!"}
{"text":"Came back to this restaurant a second time and had the veggie green curry dish. The first time I had the street style Phad Thai. This place has yet to let me down. As much as I can't say I have tried many of the items or even tried the same item more than once, I have thoroughly enjoyed each dish. Love the vibe and the tight seating arrangement, I hardly mind sharing elbow room at a communal table. I will most definitely be back to sample another wonderful dish!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I have had to bump down my rating on Khao San Road... I went to their new location, hoping that they would've gotten their shit together when it comes to reservations, etc. (I mean, if Pai can manage to do reservations, why can't KSR?)... but nope! They still don't take reservations.

Also, the food quality has declined. I ordered the 3 flavour pad thai (which used to be my favourite) and it does not taste like it did at all. It was too saucy and sweet. Ugh. Sad to say, but I probably will be switching over to Pai from now on, at least when I'm in that area."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, well worth the wait! Love the thai food here :)

The food: 5/5 - Been here twice and coincidentally both times on valentines day. First time my boyfriend and I had the squash fritters, red curry, and the three flavours pad thai. The second time around we again had the squash fritters, this time the green curry and the bangkok-style pad thai. Yum yum yum. The squash fritter are a joy to look at as well as eat. Crunchy and complimented well by the sauce that comes on the side with it. Both curries that we ordered we requested as mild and even so still had a tiny kick but overall enjoyed the sweetness of the green curry and the tangyness of the red curry. The pad thai is amazing here. Large servings, well cooked noodles and fresh ingredients to tie it all together. The sauce is just enough and although at first it looks like a small serving, you'll realize never to judge it by a first glance again. With decent sized servings and great tasting food, I would highly recommend this place to all who love thai food :)

Cost: 4/5 - a bit on the pricey side, but by the end of the meal you are more than satisfied to dish out the monies.

Service 4.5/5 - for a place that is pretty much always packed, I've always been satisfied by their service here. You'd typically start your visit in line but they do give you the option to leave your number instead so you don't have to torture yourself watching everyone else eat which is nice. After being seated, you are quickly attended to by another server and when finally placing your order they are patient when it comes to answering questions about which meal you want to order. There are very few places that offer great service when their restaurants are packed so again, highly recommended for a great meal.

Ambience: 3.5/5 - it's a trendy place where the servers are dressed casually and they have an adorable bar area and two ares for seating. Unfortunately since it does get packed, they tend to cram customers togethers and especially for the long communal tables it can almost be uncomfortably close to another party or pair. This is my one complaint about this place, but after you get over it, it was more than a joy to eat here and I am definitely returning when I can."}
{"text":"I rarely give five stars but if there is a place you must try Khao San Road is it!!  The service was prompt and the music was good. The food was amazing!  The tom yum soup was fantastic. The deep fried shrimp were delicate and light and full of flavor. The chicken spring rolls were outstanding!  Then to top it off the chefs special pad Thai was the best I have ever had. I cannot wait to go back. The staff was incredible and as others have said it is well worth the wait. See you soon Khao San Road!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best thai places in the city! Curries, pad thai, all of it. The only thing that bothers me is the super long waits, about an hour or two on busy nights. They don't take reservations. So if  you've got them time, put your name down and go somewhere else for a drink before dinner."}
{"text":"It is already 9pm weekday and I thought I can get a seat.  To my surprise, the line up is all the way out of the doors.  What makes this restaurant so attractive?  I seat and wait for my turn.  The waiter constantly updates us with the status of the table availability.  A gesture that is not common to other restaurants.

The atmosphere is energetic.  There is a bar full of wines on the shelf.  The music makes you like to dance.  There are not that many tables in the restaurant with many that can be shared.  I got a table right in front of the kitchen.  

We order Mango juice for our drinks.  The appetizer is a Fresh roll (Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw). The chicken is tender well mixed with the lettuce and carrot.  The sauce is tasty with peanuts and coriander, much better than the usual fish sauce.  Then come the Chicken Yellow Curry (Gaeng Graree) and the Chef's Special Shrimp Pad Thai  (Sam Roas).  In a Thai restaurant, the Pad Thai can determine whether it is an above average restaurant or not.  With my high expectation, it does not fail me.  The Pad Thai is very delicious.  Its texture is just right and not too soft and not too hard.  The taste is not too sweet and a tint of sour.  It is perfect.  The Yellow Curry comes with a lot of Chicken and a few potatoes.  The curry is irresistible and we pack it even there is left over.  Finally we order the dessert, the one and only one in the restaurant, Sa Koo Ma Prao.  It has small tapioca, tastes like sago, in a coconut milk with young coconut.   

Every dish is above average.  I now wonder why all the Yelpers have recommended this restaurant.  I would highly recommended this restaurant giving the friendly service, the good food and the urban atmosphere."}
{"text":"As it was already late after 9pm, I wasn't looking for anything too heavy for dinner.

We ordered:

-The Soup of the Day which was a Tom Yum - $5

-Gai Taud Samoon Prai (Garlic Chicken) Pieces of fried chicken breaded in a crispy garlic and fresh kaffir lime leaf coating served with a sweet and tangy garlic sauce - $8 

-Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw - $6 Fresh rolls filled with home-made chicken sausage, lettuce, carrots, mint leaves and Thai basil, served with tamarind garlic sauce. 


The bad:

Service was friendly, but not perfect. Had a mix up on the order and had to wait some time for it to get fixed. Water was topped for myself but not for my guest?  Strange.. When ordering I was suggested to order the starter size soup $5 instead of cup $3, because it would contain shrimps and the cup would just be more soup. The Tom Yum had no shrimps in it. 

The good:

Taste, food quality and presentation definite 5 stars.  The garlic chicken, freshly prepared breaded coating was light and panko like. Perfectly salted. Fresh rolls couldn't have been done better, tightly rolled, and cut bite sized. The Tom Yum soup was spicy, sour, salty all at the same time. 

The atmosphere:

bright spot lighting, bare gray painted walls, basement, with dark brown hardwood strip floors, and a large chalk board in the back with the featured specials. Butcher block table surfaces - a trendy look. Reminds me of Salt in Vancouver (with the chalkboard and butcher block tables) 

Just gets docked a point for the amateur service that night. Will go back for sure though because of the really excellent food and preparation. Great choice for Thai downtown. I had expectations going in and Khao San Road delivered."}
{"text":"Best pad thai I've ever had.  I eat here often.  I also like the green curry and the coconut dessert."}
{"text":"True Thai Food! We only ordered food for PickUp so far cause it is always quite crowded. But the PickUp is usually done within 15 minutes. Their flavours and spices are lovely, everything is VERY fresh (as you always expect but sometimes at other places might not get) prices are very ok.  We love it!"}
{"text":"I love Pai and so I wanted to give this place a try as well. The entrance was hard to find. It was at a weird back alleyway. I do like the decor of the place but I found seating to be very limited. If you didn't have a reservation, you'd be seated near the bar or by the door. Chilly especially during winter. 

I ordered the fresh spring rolls and the Pad Thai. For the spring rolls, I didn't want any Thai basil which the server said it's already pre-made so it couldn't be done. I ordered shrimp pad thai which was a complete joke. Small serving size and it was overly salty. On my entire plate, I had 3 pieces of shrimp. It was ridiculous. 

Service wasn't that great either. Do yourself a favour and go to Pai instead. You'll be much happier with the service, serving size,seating, and food!!"}
{"text":"A friend is always raving about this so he took me one day, HOLY MOLY its AMAZING!!! Service was great and the food was soooooo good."}
{"text":"Yummy we had the squash fritters. A definite must!  We also ordered the chicken khao soi and green curry.  So excited over good food, we are going back to try something else on the menu.  Restaurant doesn't take reservations but their timely placing of people is excellent. They will call you and advise you when your table is ready. Starbucks close by to wait in."}
{"text":"Had so many people recommend this place as the best spot for Thai Food in Toronto. 

Turns out they were right. Stop reading yelp and go eat there (as long as it's not too busy already)."}
{"text":"Excellent. The only downside is that if you don't have a reservation, the wait is very long, and for good reason. I tried the spiciest option on my chicken dish, and it was amazing! Definitely not for the meek. I'm looking forward to going again soon!"}
{"text":"While this place was busy, we were seated very quickly. We ordered the squash appetizer and it was delicious! The the red curry dish and the 3 flavour pad Thai were also both amazing. 

Main dishes are about 15 dollars, which is a bit pricey, but would recommend if looking for some solid Thai food."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai in the city without a doubt. Just amazing flavors and extremely friendly staff. Definitely order a Thai ice tea."}
{"text":"The green curry, pad Thai and squash fritters are dellllliiiiccciouuusss.

BUT don't plan your night around dining here, as they don't take reservations and waits are ridiculous. 

Food is beautiful, fresh and authentic. I love doing take out from here!"}
{"text":"Really authentic food, had the Gra Bong (squash fritters), Gaeng Massaman, and Khao Soi and everything was served fresh, hot and delicious.  Only complaint is that the place is still setting up and hasn't sorted out its liquor license, so you are limited to wine by the bottle and bottles of Singha beer."}
{"text":"Ate here during TIFF with three fellow diners. Food was a cut above standard Thai food in the city, but nothing mind-blowing. Definitely not worth the 2.5-hour wait but if you can snag a table in a relatively short amount of time, I would recommend trying it out. With that said, I would suggest trying the  Khao Soi dish - it was superb!"}
{"text":"Bottom line - wait on Fridays and saturdays should be 45 mins for two ppl, 
more for grps. The food is good, but here is the thing, if you know a place called 
Sukho Thai 
http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sukho-thai-toronto
and happen to go there, you'll get the same food, and would not have to wait that long either.. Apparently both Khan Sao and Sukho thai use to have the same owner. 
Make sure you grab the waiter's attention yourself, and the place is a touch overpriced, and yeah overhyped too ..."}
{"text":"Goddamn, this Thai restaurant is as good as Night + Market in LA and I don't say that lightly. I went with a Thai person who said this is the best Thai food he's had in North America. We ended up here on a lark. It was the closest non-Western restaurant I found when I did a search for Asian food on Yelp. It gives me hope for Toronto food which I've been a bit disappointed by so far..."}
{"text":"This has become our go-to for anyone's birthday or farewell. It's got a great vibe  (a little loud at times) but the food is amazing. Service is great; the servers always try to recommend something and ask about your allergies. But back to the food, Khao Soi is a must and so is the street pad thai. Lastly, if you're thirsty, go for the thai Ice teaThe Thai Ice Tea is also great in the summer. Be prepared to wait. There's almost always a line up."}
{"text":"I was first brought here by a friend who absolutely insisted I must go, and that I wouldn't be disappointed. The restaurant was small, the restaurant name wasn't blatant, but the bustle and the crowd surrounding the restaurant lets you know right off the bat that it's something you've got to try.

The first major downfall is that it's extremely busy - of course, this isn't the fault of the restaurant - but on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll likely be looking at a long, long wait. We almost didn't get a table (as we were likely the last people to be seated before closing), but the staff were very accommodating. The decor is quite nice, and very quaint - they play good music as well! 

Now, let's get to the important part - the food. After trying pad thai in Bangkok, I never expected to be impressed, especially from a Toronto-based fusion restaurant. However, when I tried the Chef's Special Pad Thai with chicken, I was pleasantly surprised. The flavour was very notable and blended perfectly. You can choose your level of spice, which caters nicely to different tastes. Generally, a Thai restaurant can be evaluated by its ability to make pad thai - one of the (if not the most) popular Thai dishes). 

No, Khao San Road is not the overlord of all Thai food joints. However, it's very good - the price is decent, the selection is broad, and it's probably the best Thai food I've had in the GTA thus far. It's definitely a place to try, and try again. And, hey, if I was given the choice to eat at Khao San Road in Bangkok again, or Khao San Road in Toronto, I think I'd pick Toronto!"}
{"text":"Quick thoughts on Khao San Road restaurant experience: Completely over packed with disorganized and rude staff. When ordering takeout they ask people to wait outside in the cold, rain, snow. 

Longer explanation: We (my coworkers and I) used to call this the \"tender beef\" place because whenever we had a corporate event we'd order a bunch of dishes and the favourite was the Khao Soi with beef. The beef always came so tender and amazing that every week we'd order our event food from the restaurant. We looked forward to it.

However, during our last event (three weeks ago) the people who ate the Khao Soi got food poisoning. At first we were shocked and tried to find another explanation... but, everyone kept pointing out that it was only the people who ate the beef that got sick.

Skip to recently, when I decided to give them another try for dinner (by myself)... because I really missed the \"tender beef.\" So, I went to the restaurant to order take-out. The experience was completely terrible. The restaurant packed was beyond capacity, I stood in THREE lines before I could to get to the point where I could order food, and I'm sad to say that the \"tender beef\" was a lump of rock hard meat that I couldn't even chew through. It was inedible.

On top of all of this, the noodles that came with the Khao Soi smelled rancid. And unfortunately, I discovered this only after taking a few bites... and spent the rest of the evening hovering over a toilet.

As such we've officially decided to completely cross this restaurant off our event list; and I've removed it from my own \"foodie\" recommendation list for people who are visiting Toronto. Avoid it!"}
{"text":"Great sit down restaurant though I would definitely recommend that this be a place to enjoy a good meal and not a conversation.  The ambiance is quiet cozy yet loud making meaningful conversation very difficult. 
The service is very good with a great balance of seating to order and order to food arrival times. We ordered the red Urey and the vegetarian stir fried noodles (not pad Thai). The curry came out to be a very dense meal from the coconut milk, which i personally enjoyed though my dining partner much preferred the noodles which were well spiced and had a very distinct savory appeal to them that was possible tied to a mix of tamarind and peanuts. 

Make plans early to come here as a line will form within an hour of dinner open."}
{"text":"Authentic thai food. Always booming with customers may prove its authenticity and quality, but popularity also comes with long lines, very long lines. Try their green curry its DELICIOUS (comes with lime leaves) whaaaaat. SImply awesome."}
{"text":"Unfortunately a fail. Experience lacks at their attempt for mass appeal and scale. Trying to skip steps doesn't pay off. Next!"}
{"text":"I frequent Sabai Sabai, it's 'sister store', and SukhoThai on Wellington. I've heard from many that they are all comparable but KSR was the best, and since I really like both places I was excited to check it out. 

The decor is bright and colourful, with art all over the walls and simple wooden tables throughout. It's a great fun and casual place to eat. My favourite atmosphere out of the three. I had the squash fritters and the Khao Soi, both were delicious. I tried hard to spot the difference between the dishes I had here and the same had at the other two restaurants but didn't notice any. Someone beside me was eating the green curry rice dish, unique to KSR, which looked and smelled amazing. I imagine there are more interesting options here that I will have to try when I'm back."}
{"text":"Fried tofu appetizers were great.  Pad Thai best of class.  The house special with wet noodles and crispy on top was fantastic!  Very busy place so plan on a wait at peak hours.  The Thai spice level (6) was not excessive as someone who loves heat.  But it built up steam and I was sweating at the end.  Must revisit when back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious! My coworker introduced several of us to Khao San Road for the first time tonight and it did not disappoint. I got the three flavour pad thai with tofu, very spicy. Next time I'll get a less spicy version - it was a bit too hot for me!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, but this place is always rammed! Go really early for lunch. Haven't even tried going for dinner. But the best Thai food outside Thailand. Everywhere else in Toronto (save for their sister restaurants Sabai Sabai, etc) is a joke."}
{"text":"Food is great from past experiences but the service is horrible. The popularity of your restaurant doesn't mean you can get away from providing basic services. I called 7 times to make a takeout order at 6pm and nobody answered the phone. Coming from New York, popular restaurants all still pickup their phones no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"I've now been to Khao San Road three times for lunch.  The first thing you should know about lunch on a weekday: GO EARLY.  11:45 will probably get you a seat if you're a small group, but 11:35 is even better.  They don't seat you until your entire party is there.

The second thing you should know is that I have never been disappointed by any of the food there.  The fresh rolls are just that: fresh, and bursting with flavour.  Each vegetable and herb adds their own crunch and flavour in harmony.  I don't know what that mystery meat is (the menu goes with the vague \"chicken sausage\") but it's dang good, and the accompanying sauce is double dip worthy.

Of the main dishes, I've had Pad Gra Prao, Panang Curry, and Street Style Pad Thai.  Such an amazing balance of saltiness, sweetness, and spiciness.  There's a lot of depth to each dish, and having had \"North Americanized\" curries and pad thai before, the difference is strikingly obvious.  Everything has been a winner so far.  The price is right, too.  The curry of the day is $8, about the same kind of price you'd find at the food court, but with vastly superior food.  

So the food, in my experience, is pretty terrific.  The service is usually as good.  The servers are very friendly and attentive.  Service with a smile!  If you arrive earlier than 11:45 and don't dilly dally, you can usually get your order in before the massive lunch crush which is helpful if you want to leave in a more reasonable amount of time.  If you get caught with the crowd, there could a little bit of a wait for the food.

I'd eat here all the time if I wasn't on a quest to try different things.  Still, it's great to know that there's a reliable and delicious stand-by if I need it.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow, the food is amazing at Khao San Road - it's simply delicious!!  I was amazed with everything we ordered. The garlic chicken had a really flavourful panko batter with a hint of lemongrass on the outside and tender and perfectly cooked inside!

Both the Khao Soi and street Pad Thai were both made perfectly too. The taste, the texture, the quality of the ingredients...I just couldn't help stuffing myself silly!

The service is great too - we went for a late lunch (after 1:30) so there wasn't a wait. I'd love to come back to try the rest of the menu. I love that I'm back in Toronto to enjoy the great food!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. I last visited this place a few months ago and had such an awful experience that I could've sworn I reviewed it. But some how that review is no longer here. So I'm going to post it again. 

I've been coming here for years. When this place first opened and the original owners were still here, I think I came 5-6 times a month. I was addicted. The last few times, I started seeing some changes. I didn't think much of it until I started noticing the food quality going down. That prompted me to do a bit of research and that's when I learned how the original owners, Jeff and Nuit Regular, had a falling out with their (former) partner Monte Wan. Clearly the awfulness that is now Khao San Road has to do with Wan's influence. 

First, the service was atrocious. I ordered my usual which was squash fritters and pad gra prao. I noticed there were some new \"spice levels\". So I asked for Thai spicy. Immediately the waitress gave me this look and asked if I had that level before. Technically I haven't because I haven't had to order a level before. She immediately followed up her question with \"because if you find it too spicy we won't fix it for you\". WTF. 1) I just wanted it as spicy as it used to be. 2) I don't know how spicy is your \"Thai spicy\" without trying it first and 3) learn some customer service skills before you work in this industry. In the meantime, STFU bitch. 

Now, the food quality has definitely changed. So it's not like the food is so amazing that it can excuse the shit rules and service. I'm reading the recent reviews and I don't know how people are still saying it's amazing. Really?! The squash fritters tasted pre-fried and sitting out for awhile and the pad gra prao was under seasoned. Are they using Thai basil now or something? It's definitely different. 

I realize that I must sound like I work for Pai, the Regulars's new place, or I'm affiliated with them or something. Well I don't and I haven't even tried Pai yet. I just found out about it so I look forward to trying it in the near future. I noticed they have pad gra prao on the menu so I can't wait. I know Nuit Regular will make it right."}
{"text":"Let me also add to the chorus of positive reviews for this restaurant.  The fried tofu with garlic was delicious.  We had the vegetarian street style pad thai which was outstanding.  The red curry was okay not great.  For me, it was a little short on vegetables.  My only complaint with the restaurant is the hours -- the kitchen closes too early on the weekend.  We are late dinner eaters and I understand that many Toronto restaurants don't stay open late, for this kind of restaurant, I would have expected them to serve until at least 11pm."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is hands down, the best and most authentic thai food in Toronto. My absolute favourite dish is the Pad Kee Mao; super spicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. Thai is generally hard to botch because it's rich and creamy, but the curry here has a light, spicy freshness that marks it right away as something special. Chef's special pad thai was also excellent, as was the \"Prawn pieces\" appetizer. The only miss was the ordinary appetizer dish of shrimp and veggie rolls, which was a huge step below the quality of everything else.

Definitely plan to get here early or wait though... we arrived on Thursday night at 7:30 and had to wait 1 hour (although it was still worth it)."}
{"text":"Hailed as one of the 'trendier' restaurants in Toronto serving up Thai cuisine, Khao San doesn't disappoint on the appearance front.  The interior is perfect for a date or lunch with a friend - it's cozy, minimalistic, but with a nice modern touch to it.  The service experience that I had was great - attentive wait staff that weren't overly pushy on upselling, and who were highly efficient.

I ordered the classic pad thai, and it was absolutely delicious. However, for its price, I've had similar for a lot less (Thai Basil, one of my favourites, comes to mind! For less than what you pay at Khao San, you get a soup and spring rolls with your dish too.) Overall, although not one of my favorites, it's a solid choice for Thai and you won't leave with any regrets."}
{"text":"Trekked through downtown today, in the snow, looking for KSR.  I was beginning to think it didn't exist until i walked right in front of it and thought to myself, why is this closed down place filled with people dining? I inched forward to the \"closed\" sign taped to the door. ha! to my surprise I found IT!  i found Khao San Road! taped on a 81/2 by 11 piece of paper. hm.. I was a little suspicious of this amazing \"little hole in the wall\" as described by my friend. Stepped in and thanked god immediately that my friend called for RSVP!  .. This place is PACKED! ok. that's a good sign that a little resto in middle of nowhere can be this packed."}
{"text":"Three flavours pad Thai is SO good. Medium is just the right amount of spice. Pad graprao is also really tasty. This place gets so so so busy though and make sure you have your whole party with you - I was forced to sit at the bar after trying to hold down a table for my group. 

Food great - wish the place was bigger!"}
{"text":"Honest, it tastes exactly the same as Sukho Thai (same owner, almost same menu), with ridiculous long waits. 
If you like wasting your time waiting outside for an hour + during dinner hours, then this is definitely your place to be."}
{"text":"Chalk up another great meal under Yelp discoveries.

My IDIOT friend wanted to eat at Salad King...it was thankfully packed full of dullards so I suggested we try the spot that's hot on Yelp. 

Right in the entertainment district in a basement and without obvious signage was probably the best Thai meal I've had. 

The space is modern, clean, well run, well lit, cool - everything that you want - even a few communal tables at the front for walkin' in.

The highlight for me was def. the squash fritters. Basically balls of squash/thai spices deep fried. I've never had anything quite like it. Could eat a whole bucket full of those things. And that was the appateezer.

The mains were delicious - more standard fare. The only sorta-lowlight of the meal were the Thai-iced-tea thing. It had about half a can of condensed milk in it. SO GROSS. So don't order that if you're not a tiny child or just some really weird person."}
{"text":"This place is a winner. I have been to Thailand and eaten many different thai dishes, but this place is the best I've ever had. Definitely order the pad Thai, it is amazing. Very hip atmosphere, with many communal picnic bench style tables. 

They have singha beers (one of my favourites), a large selection of wines, and you can even get a Thai bucket (massive bucket of rum/redbull/coke) if your feeling rowdy. 

Be prepared to wait, as this place is always packed. They don't take reservations, but you can put your name on a waiting list and they will call you once a table is available."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the city. Authentic and simple, some small tables and a few communal high tops. 
From the moment they open it's packed and for good reason, but they move people fast without rushing and the servers are always great. 

Obviously the Phad Thai is a go-to staple but the squash fritters are the best appetizer (huge portion), khao soi is really good if you like really saucy coconut milk. 
My favourite curry is the Red Curry because of the squash in it. So delicious."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the food and table service were excellent. No complaints.

Now, a story: we showed up for our lunch reservation (20 people on a Friday) about 5 minutes early. The owner, Monte Wan was working the front door and started things off on the wrong foot immediately. First, he remarked about our being early (again, 5 minutes early) in a way that made it feel like we were greatly inconveniencing him; it was 11:35 AM and the restaurant was empty. Our table was ready.

Second, we had 17 of the 20 people we reserved for with us, and at first he was not going to seat us until the entire party arrived. Which is understandable if you have 2 of 8 people, but at 17 of 20 I feel like some accommodation should be made. Monte made a point of finding the person in the group who had booked the reservation over the phone, and in front of everybody, condescendingly asked that person whether the rules had been explained to us over the phone. With some argument he eventually relented and sat our party but not before giving us a 10-minute warning to get the remaining diners to the table, saying he would give away the extra seats if they didn't show. (The free seats were singles on the ends of our two tables).

Our party was all there within 15 minutes and the rest of the meal proceeded without incident. Again, I want to reiterate that the food and service were very good. But they shouldn't let Monte work the door if he's going to be rude to his customers like that. I understand this is a tough business and I totally get why they are strict about seating complete parties in general (yes, I've read the Toronto Star piece) but the next time we're booking a lunch for our company, Khao San Road will not be on the list."}
{"text":"OVERHYPED, think ppl jst want to sound cool being in downtown.
Same experience, if your paying for dinner outside, atleast need better service, ambience. 
Signature dishes are good. My frens Green Curry was the worst food ever, it was hot Green WATER with veggies dunked in it. better go to a place where you get good service and time to even sit n read the menu...."}
{"text":"Good, authentic Thai food. Average price for meals. Having gone to Thailand for a few months, this is as close as I've found in Toronto to being authentic Thai food. The khao soi is delicious. The pad see ew is also really good. Always busy in the weekends during lunch and dinner. Communal tables. Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. We've wanted to try it before but there would always be a long line up and results in us choosing another place to dine in. 

We arrived right at 5pm dinner opening time and were seated quickly. We ordered the bankok style pad that and the khao soi. Both were delicious. The pad thai could have had more of a kick in spices. The khao soi was perfect. The curry in the khao soi is one to be remembered. The mango juice we ordered was great but tasted a bit artificial. Next time I'll be sure to try the Thai iced tea since it looked like the most ordered drink of the night.

One complaint is that it was very cold while dining in even though we were seated far from the door. Every time the door opened it got quite chilly. If they could improve the heating , the whole experience would have been much better. We found ourselves wanting to wear our jackets while seated.

The service and staff were patient and attentive.

Would go again, more likely once the weather gets better unless they improve their heating.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Always a good time at KSR.

Fave dish is Beef Khao Soi.  Much much better than Salad King and similar to the flavours in Thailand!

The spice levels are aggressive.. Mild still gets me sweating and I typically drink Sriracha.

The squash fritters are money - I never visit without ordering them!

Enjoy some great Thai food here but expect to wait for a table virtually every time."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in all my travels across Canada"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dinner at Khao San Road. Came with two friends and we each got a dish and split to try as much of the menu as possible. I really liked the decor and space. The table was the perfect size and it didn't feel too cramped. 

In terms of waiting, we didn't have to wait but they do not seat you until your whole party arrives. 

Between the green curry, pad thai and pad gra prao, I would definitely re order the pad gra prao and pad thai again. The green curry was okay but a bit runny for my tastes. The spicy here is not super spicy but the waitress warned us just in case. 

Decor was great and the whole place was super busy but we service was still good. We had our waters refilled at least twice and the food was prompt. Would definitely come back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Went here for a some authentic street thai food. Service is okay for a busy night. Waiting in line is frustrating. I waited 15 minutes until a waiter noticed me. I came alone so they just gave me a random bar seat. Some people behind me were obviously there for 10 minutes before a waiter noticed noticed them and had them wait another 15 minutes because they were in groups (and plus 15 more minutes before their food come). So total wait for groups is at least around 35 minutes(possibly more) before they could chow down. 
I ordered the beef khao soi, squash fritter and thai ice tea. Love the squash fritter. It was not greasy at all. Sweet and crunchy is a nice way to work up my freezing palate. Their thai ice tea is the best. Really fresh compared to other places. I'm not sure what they added, but it was definitely more than sweet condensed milk and sugar. They might use rock sugar or palm sugar. I'm not sure, but the sweetness feels familiar to soupy desserts that my mom used to make. I don't really dig the khao soi. For me, the spices are too light that it tasted bland for me. I think they're trying to fit it into north american tounge. I will definitely come back to try their pad thai and curries because I love their thai ice tea."}
{"text":"Above average level service and great food! The waitress was friendly and accommodating! Loved the food. Def worth a try!"}
{"text":"One of my best pad thai I have ever had!
I also enjoyed their iced tea too! 
Love their vibes and food.
Good service although it was a few lineup at lunch hours."}
{"text":"What can I say that others haven't? This place, part of the Sukhothai Toronto empire, serves the best thai food in the city. The curries are great, but I'm particularly a fan of the noodle dishes. The Pad Kee Mao and Pad Thai are phenomenal, and I don't even generally like pad thai. The squash fritters were a pleasant surprise as well. My friends and I return here once in a while, but the constant line ups and wait times force us to dine much more often at the other Sukhothai locations. Hence, the 4 rather than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Couple of things that the real Khao San Road in City of Angle and the one here in Hog Town share in common are, the infectious and fanatic crowd and good eats!

During my recent visit, I've found my favorite dish, Pad Phed Pah.  It's peppery and full of flavors.  I love the rustic pungency from wild ginger, kaffir lime leave and basil.  I requested extra spicy, and let me tell you, it was fiery good!  Make sure you have plenty of napkins to wipe away your tears and sweat.

Pad Kee Mao was still as good as ever, next time I will go with the server's recommendation for spicy, not medium spicy.

Saku or Tapioca, in lightly sweet and creamy coconut milk, was perfect for soothing my overworked palate from the previous dish.

I'm happy to see Khao San Road is doing so well.  But the large crowds piling into the small space are madness!  It's difficult to make a reservations so try to get there before 6pm and be prepared to sit at the communal tables or at the bar.  That's what I did.

Still a fan!"}
{"text":"We came  here for lunch and the line was almost out the door.  Because people were coming and going and because of the long line up, a lot of cold air was getting into the restaurant through the two sets of doors.  Unfortunately I happened to be one of the unlucky patrons standing right by the inner door while waiting for a seat and someone who worked at the restaurant yelled very rudely and unprofessionally  from across the restaurant to close the door.  But we all thought he meant the outside door.  The he comes by the door and yells JUST AT ME for holding the door open for five minutes and how cold it is and I alone cooled down the entire restaurant. I don't even think I had been in there for five minutes.

To the dude who yelled at me: it is pretty unpleasant  to be singled out and yelled at in front of the entire restaurant, so please don't do that to your customers.  Would it have been so hard to ask politely, and say thank you once I had closed the door instead of yelling at me again after I apologized?  Your restaurant should be set up so that your patrons can eat there comfortably and in reasonable warmth.  Don't blame the fact that it's not set up that way -- or that you can't manage long line ups better --  on a customer who just came in from the cold and is trying to get seated at your fabulous restaurant.

So in summary, if you feel like getting a warm meal while being treated with dignity, maybe try somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"When we first arrived we were tempted to find a new place since the wait was an hour for two people. But instead of ruling this place out, we listened to the hostesses recommendations and left our name on the list with our number. While we waited we grabbed drinks at a nearby bar. 

After receiving a text saying our table was ready, we were promptly seated and our orders were taken. The menu isn't extensive or complicated but everything on it looks great. Also the restaurant is small and busy so if you have issues sitting next to strangers, this is not the place for you. 

I had the chef special pad Thai which was fantastic. Slightly sweeter than any pad Thai I've had in the past, this one definitely stood out and will be remembered as a fantastic meal. 

If you're in the mood for awesome food at a small, hip restaurant I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wow, the waitress was actually Thai! I got to use some of the Thai that I learned in Thailand and, oh yeah, the food was some of the best and most authentic that I have had outside of Thailand. In fact, the Khao Soi was some of the only Khao Soi that I have seen in Toronto. Most Thai restaurants do not make it, or do not make it properly.

Waiting in line is not that fun (especially in winter) and it is crowded and noisy, but for me the food outweighs any other negatives because it is that good. If you care a lot about ambience, and having a reservation, this is not the place for you. If you are looking for truly authentic Thai food this is one of the best places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love Thai food - curries, noodles dishes and soups, etc, I love them all! Khao San Road is one of Toronto's most loved Thai restaurants and I finally got to try it last week (don't ask why it took so long). My friends and I made our way there for 6 P.M. and already there was a long line - we ended up waiting around 20 minutes, which isn't TOO bad.

 This isn't a huge space but with communal seatings effectively laid out throughout the restaurant, they are able to sit a lot of diners comfortably. With the warmer weather, they have added 3 extra tables just on the outside of the restaurant.  Just know that if you choose to sit there, they won't be able to serve you alcohol.

Had:
Khao Soi with chicken ($14.00) 
Panang Curry with tofu & veggies ($14.00)
Pad See Ew with chicken ($15.00) 

Their service seemed to be efficient even with the bustling crowds and the food was absolutely delicious.  I would say my favourite of the visit was the Pad See Ew and the Khao Soi as well. I loved the abundance of Khao Soi's golden curry - we ordered an extra side of rice eat with it after we devoured the noodles!  I will definitely be going back to this spot!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great food, great atmosphere. Amazing Pad Thai and other dishes great too. A must in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times...back when the Regulars owned it and after it changed ownership.  I heard that the quality of the food had gone down since the change in ownership but I haven't noticed that.  The squash fritters remain my favourite starter - super crispy without being too oily.  Their curries all remain solid with the massaman curry being my absolute favourite.

They don't take reservations so the wait can bit a bit long...but it's not too bad as long as it's not too cold outside."}
{"text":"It was decent thai food don't get me wrong, but is it the best in Toronto like I read so many times? Hmmm, I don't know. We went there on Sunday evening around 6:50, got seated at 7:20 and entries came at 8:00pm. The pad thai and pad gra Prao (essentially like the Taiwan minced pork rice just with lots of basil and red peppers) came out like I expected- tasty, average portioned, and on the line of good food from a good Thai restaurant. It didn't exceed my expectations ( like the pad thai from Linda's), and didn't justify the 30 mins wait in the cold( they only let you wait in the restaurant when it's hour turn to get seated)."}
{"text":"One of the best spots for thai food in Toronto. I'm a huge fan of the Khao Soi - but beware - it's filling! Be prepared to wait during peak times."}
{"text":"Been to this place 2 or 3 times so far and it's great. I tasted flavors I never knew existed. Expect this place to be very busy almost all the time.
I'm a Thai food noob and the server was helpful in explaining the menu."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for the first time based on the numerous positive reviews. It was just before 3:00pm on Saturday and we had to wait for a few minutes before we could get a table for 2. The place was packed with groups, friends and couples. I was really excited and looking forward to trying this place, but overall, I was under whelmed by the food. I ordered the Red Chicken curry with 5-6 chilies. My boyfriend ordered the chicken pad thai. Both dishes took no time to be served and presentation was nice. I am happy that the jasmine rice was included in the price of the curry. Overall, it was good, but didn't meet my expectations. In fact, my curry dish was not very spicy. I would say that it was moderately spicy. I was really expecting a good kick with the 5-6 chilies I ordered. I had a bit of the Pad Thai and it was just OK. Mind you, I am not a big fan of pad thai to begin with but I have had better. I am giving this place 3 stars though because service was quick and I liked the atmosphere of the place. I would go back if I am in the area, but I would not go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"How to say it.  It's so much nicer than the actual Khao San Road in Thailand you guys.
Packed out, but the wait was still just ten minutes!  Quality food, quick and easy atmosphere.  
The braised beef in the yellow curry noodle soup was unreal--I will seriously dream about it."}

After reading so many reviews and comments online about how crazy they get at busy hours, I made sure to get there early for lunch. They open at 11:30 for lunch on weekdays and I arrived around 11:40 and ended up being 2nd customer walking in for lunch. Restaurant is decent size with small tables for 2, 4 and larger tables for bigger groups- and there is also a bar area where you can dine by yourself.

Ordered: Garlic Tofu (Tao Hoo Taud Samoon Prai) 4/5

*Fried tofu breaded in a crispy garlic & fresh kaffir lime coating served w/ sweet & tangy garlic sauce for $8.00
*11 pieces of semi-hard tofu almost looked like chicken nuggets
*A lot of the reviews said it came super hot but it was just hot when I got mine
*Usually I don't like tofu but this was bursting with flavor
*Because they use semi-hard tofu, it feels like you are eating soft chicken nuggets
*Big for an appetizer, it might be good to share between 3-4 people
*These deep fried tofu don't even really need the sauce, it's already seasoned within the batter
*Sauce is fresh and the sweetness balances out the strong garlic batter
*Watch out for garlic breath after eating this (I swear your breath will smell like raw garlic after)
*Not recommened if you are on a date!!

Ordered: Pad Thai (Street Style) 5/5

*Steet Style Pad Thai with broccoli with option of chicken/tofu for $10
*Their lunch portions are quite generous
*Broccoli pieces looked kind of random sitting on top of the Pad Thai
*Chose tofu option for the Pad Thai
*This had really good flavor, just sweet enough with spiciness that kicks in after
*Notice how the Pad Thai (sauce) is not at all red
*It didn't taste artificial or overly ketchupy like many express Thai places do it
*This Pad Thai was probably closest to what I had back in Thailand, no doubt
*I would go back for this dish

Ordered: Khao Soi 3/5

*Tender braised beef with egg noodles in a coconut milk enriched curry topped with crisp fried noodles for $10.00
*This looked absolutely gorgeous on some of the photos I saw prior to visiting this place
*I was looking forward to trying this because it's nothing like what I've tried in the past
*Option of braised beef or chicken for this dish, I went with beef cause that's what everyone recommened
*Curry is beautiful bright yellow color, very thick and rich and there is a lot of it
*Noodles go very well with the coconut curry and the braised beef is very tender
*Curry wasn't very hot when it came...not sure if it's suppose to be like that
*The way they serve this dish, it makes me think that the curry is suppose to be like soup for this dish
*Curry is too thick to be a soup for this dish which makes it quite difficult to eat cause you don't want the curry splattering everywhere
*Half way through this, I realized this is somewhat like Islamic Noodles I had at Salad King (see here)
*Now they serve Khao Soi at Salad King as well (but haven't tried it there)
*I would personally prefer this dish to be served on a pasta plate with less sauce 
*Curry tasted a little too sweet half way through
*I wouldn't recommened eating this if you have nice top on or anything white (or just really be careful)

Ordered: Thai Iced Tea (Cha Nom Yen) 4/5

*Thai spice and Black tea blended with condensensed milk served over crushed ice for $4.50
*This somewhat reminds me of Vietnamese coffee (drip coffee with condensed milk served over ice)
*Dark orange liquid in a huge glass filled with ice
*This is almost like Chocolate milk without the chocolate but with the bitter tea aftertaste
*Good to have with their food, to wash down all the spiciness

I know many people compare Khao San Road to Salad King (check out my review here)- saying Khao San Road is authentic Thai and Salad King is somewhat westernized- which I do agree, it's true. Khao San Road's chef doesn't hold back on Thai spices and garlic which allows their dishes to be bursting with Thai flavor. Salad King's dishes are much more toned down and compared to Khao San Road, it could seem a little bland in terms of flavor. Because of the spices, Khao San Road's dishes feels heavy whereas Salad King's dishes seem lighter (if that makes any sense). It's really a personal preferance as to if you prefer Khao San Road or Salad King.

Summary: Khao San Road focuses on staying true to Thai flavors, so be aware and get ready to taste some garlic if you've only tried food court Thai food. Personally, I like both places- I def think Khao San Road makes better Pad Thai but if I wanted noodles in coconut curry, I would visit Salad King for Islamic Noodles."}
{"text":"Tried the Khak Soi and pad see ew. Very generous portions and lots of meat - which is a rarity. The Soi was very flavorful and fulfilling - I couldn't finish it and the pad see ew was good, altho the chicken could have been more flavorful. It was a good meal, but not as amazing for me as all the other reviews. Maybe I'm just not that into Thai food so if u r, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Yellow curry was fabulous!  Had to wait but only for about 20 minutes on a Wednesday night.  Food was worth every minute of the wait!"}
{"text":"I am on those few weirdos that did not buy into the hype of this place. To begin with, I will fully say that the food is very good - but loses a lot on the overall experience and the food is NOT that good to the point that it can completely outweigh the negatives.
Yes, there will be lineups... massive ones. I was lucky because I went with 2 buddies during lunch and arrived at 11:45. As of 11:55 its pretty much jammed and a line-up forms outside. In order to shove as many people inside we are treated like cattle, with people crowded at their communal tables and stuffed so closely together that I was literally (yes, literally) rubbing elbows with the dude next to me. Forget about a private conversation or trying not to overhear the neighbor.
Having sat at 11:45, we placed our order around 11:55 give or take. There are only like 7-8 items on the menu for lunch hence you would expect them to make it constantly in the kitchen and reduce waiting times (basically the pad thai and the curries with some variations of those dishes). But no... we waited a full 40 minutes for it. We started eating at like 12:40, rushing so we could make it back to the office.
I had the pad thai. Was it good? Absolutely. Was it the best pad thai ever? Maybe, but relatively questionable - ate it with such speed that I did not enjoy the full flavor.
The service is one of the worst I have experienced - rude, slow and unpleasant. 
All in all - only go there if you are willing to put up with some massive line-ups, rude service and horrible seating for the chance to experience some very good thai food. For me personally, there are some other places that make it just as good but I don't have to put up with all the negatives."}
{"text":"Delicious! One of the best Thai restaurants I've been to in Toronto. I had the Khao Soi with Beef (gluten free) and it was absolutely to die for and we also had the chicken spring rolls (gluten free) which were also yummy. We went on Sunday for dinner and I would definitely suggest getting there half an hour before it opens to get a spot, or else you will be waiting at least 45 minutes to get in. It would be worth the wait though. 
I will definitely be going back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"I can't add much more than has already been said - great and tasty food. Busy. 

Go in off peak hours, and when you don't mind a little wait, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype! There's always a lineup even on weekday evenings but it's the buzz outside the door that adds to the excitement for Thai food.

The place is clean and modern - it reminds of many trendy new Asian restos in Hong Kong and Thailand with the crowds to match. Now, we have one in Toronto that matches the modern authentic Asian quality you get overseas. 

Expect to sit elbow to elbow with other diners. They played upbeat late 90s hip hop and r&b when we were there. The washrooms are in need of renovations to meet the decor of the main resto.

The medium spicy is a nice slow burn. The Thai iced tea is amaaaaazing and on the sweet side. It's like HK iced tea with a bit of chai flavour and the size is large for $4.50.

I enjoyed the cold rolls with a clear fragrant chilli basil dip the most. The pad thai noodles were soggier and greasier than I prefer...it's still alright. The shredded beef dish with a fried egg is Chinese style with more chillies. 

Next time I'll save room for the tapioca dessert. The bill adds up quickly...it was about $60 with tip for drinks, mains and appetizers for two."}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for a year (Pathum Thani represent!), and as someone very familiar with Thai cuisine, I can unreservedly say that this is good.  Very, very good.

I went for a Friday lunch (only a 15 minute wait!), the place is packed and loud, we had to yell across the table to hear each other.  I had the Khao Sai with the combo option (small soup and Thai chicken spring rolls).  The beef was very tender, noodles and broth delicious!  I don't mind spice in my food (in Thailand there was a time or two where I was famished but was unable to eat my meal due to the insane curry spice level).  So, to be on the spice side I went with a \"3\" which they label as \"spicy\".  That was plenty spicy for me.

I left with a very full belly and wishing I lived in Toronto so I could have this on a weekly basis!  5 stars from me means \"scream it from the rooftops!\"  Will be back to try the dinner menu for sure!  The bill came to $50 with tax and tip for two.  Reasonable!

(Noticed the few negative reviews that do exist are from people that don't like Thai food!  That's like listening to what middle-aged men think about Justin Bieber albums.  WTF?)"}
{"text":"The food was terrific. However, in the two experiences I had with Khao San, I have to say the take-out is the better option - if you stay in it's INSANELY loud - much, much more than I am usually willing to tolerate in a restaurant. 

If you're looking Thai food - this is a great place to take it out.
If you're looking for a quiet dinner - this is not the place to go to."}
{"text":"Clearly it is better than most Thai restaurants and your standard food court fare so I'll attempt to compare it to some of its peers (Sukhothai and Pai Northern to name two). It is more of the standard Thai food that you would expect but of a much higher quality. The vibe is also quite fun although the wait isn't quite worth the experience. The curries are consistently good as is the pad thai."}
{"text":"Food is good but not exceptional despite the hype. Seems like KSR embodies poor service as a business practice. I came here when they used to take reservations, even with one my party waited 40+ minutes to be seated. More recently tried ordering KSR for take out, be warned they never answer their phone so why offer the option?

Based on business practices alone I rather go to PAI where phones are answered and you get seated (when busy) even while waiting for a friend to arrive.

Although the Pad Thai here is good and they offer gluten free/vegan options, I'll take my business to the numerous other Thai places popping up in the city."}
{"text":"I almost completely walked by this place had I not looked inside and saw the crowds of people... every other restaurant I walked by on Adelaide was just about empty.  The neon blue sign is almost illegible! 

I came by myself after a coworker had suggested it and ate at the bar.  No, it wasn't awkward like some places can be when you eat by yourself.

I was pleased to notice that all the workers in the kitchen were of Asian descent - not sure if they were Thai, but it's a start towards authenticity, I guess.  All the waitresses were chatting away in Thai as well.  

I ordered a Thai tea to start - I noticed that they actually use condensed milk in their Thai teas, making for a much sweeter and thicker tea than I would prefer.  Most places sweeten their black tea directly and add half and half.  It tasted better when the ice melted.  I'd suggest asking for extra ice in your drink.

I ordered tha Khai Soi, as I'd never heard of any dish like it before.  It seemed to be the most popular pick, so I went for it - just regular spicy.  Geez, I always forget Thai spice scales are 5000x the levels of other places.  I would have been happy with a medium and I can handle quite spicy things.  I was sweating and it was in the negatives outside.

The first half of the Khao Soi dish was delicious, but it was definitely one of those dishes that you get kind of sick of eating towards the end.  It's extremely rich, as its got tons of coconut milk in it and with the extra spiciness, it was getting hard to eat.  I liked the different textures of the dish, from the fresh and delicious egg noodles to the added crisp of the crunchy noodles.  Could have had more cilantro and scallion, though.  There was an abundance of beef (chunks, not sliced) as well.  

Overall, good food and a cool place to try if you are in town."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Great food and very reasonably priced. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9.5/10
Food: 9.5/10
Atmosphere: 8.5/10
Service: 10/10

All due respect to my fellow yelp-ers, but I don't know what y'all talking about! KSR is still the best Thai in the city!

The new location yes, is still busy, but it has a great bustling vibe that is sometimes just what you need. The menu has all your staples (including, in my humble opinion, the most divine pad thai) and some other fun dishes (like the crispy rice salad). 

Upstairs, they're planning on making it a late night/snack bar area. It's planned to stay open later with cocktails and smaller, more shareable plates for those who venture in during the wee hours of the evening. 

Service is always served with a genuine smile. A definite staple!

THE BOTTOM LINE: Khao San Road still has a special place in my heart - food, service, and something a little extra at the new location (upstairs snack bar)."}
{"text":"Totally different from other Thai restaurant. Love it!! The Pad Thai(street style) is a must-try! Also the iced tea is amazing~~Be ready for the lineup."}
{"text":"The food is good but I had serious stomach problems after. I've been meaning to go again to see if it was the food but haven't had the chance: too busy.  I guess they're doing something right?"}
{"text":"I waited a whole year for KSR to re-open and not sure if it has the same vibe as the Adelaide location.

The food is great, but the atmosphere is uncomfortable. If you come during peak dinner hours (6-8pm) and you're seated next to the entrance, prepare for some cold gusts of wind making your food cold, or waiting patron's spit spray all over your food and drinks.

I came here again and was seated at the bar, way too close next to a whiny patron who complained endlessly that her food came out cold and that she was eating after everyone else because she had to send back her food. I get that's not KSR's fault, but damn, I was seated so close to her that her complaints were right in my ear. That's how close the bar stools are squeezed together.

The music is way too loud and servers are working so hard in the chaos that it's really hard to get anyone's attention for service. I suppose it's trying to emulate the Asian street style hustle and bustle, but it made me anxious. Not a place to have a conversation with friends. 

Come here alone, and only for the food, and eat fast because the cold wind will devour the heat in no time."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for Thai in Toronto (aside from Sukho Thai, which I also love and is a bit more convenient with less of a wait). I have never had a meal that was less than delicious here. Monty is always the best."}
{"text":"After coming to Khao San Road a couple of more times, I'm disappointed to say that their service is consistently indifferent and rude.

The staff responsible for takeout orders needs a stress release pill - her negative energy is not a vibe relayed onto customers. 

The serving sizes has gone down since I first came here but everything still tasted decent. If only the spacing between tables were wider, I would have chosen to eat in without having to deal with the takeout line that is super disorganized - some people standing there were waiting to pay the bill. I was ignores for a good 15 minutes. Even the times when I dined in, I found it impossible to hear my friends.

Honestly, this place is not worth the stress and the no reservation rule is overrated."}
{"text":"I have three words to describe Khao San Road - Thai food heaven!  

Finally, I got the chance to try out Khao San Road after much of the Yelp buzz and friends raving about this little joint.  Tucked away on Adelaide street just east of Spadina, you will likely find patrons lining up outside to grab a table.

They do not take reservations, so it is first come, first serve.  Also note that they will only seat you if all your members of your table have arrived.  Not to worry though, the wait is pretty quick, about 30 minutes tops if it is busy.  They turn tables pretty quick.

After we ordered, the food came out very quickly.  I was amazed on how quick service was!

Here is what we ordered:
1) Fresh rolls - light and yummy, I loved the sauce that accompanied them.
2) Garlic chicken - they were like garlicky chicken little fingers, very tasty, I also really like the sauce that came with them.
3) Pad Thai - Chicken - WOW - one of the best pad thai's I have had in the city, not red and ketchupy as other wannabe thai places
4) Yellow curry - Beef - perfect balance of savory with heat

Overall, it was a wonderful dinner - great food and quick service.

I will definitely be back for future meals!"}
{"text":"Well say hello to my new favourite Thai restaurant in town! I used to be a huge fan of Pai and while Pai is still great, Khao San Road takes Thai food to another level. If you plan on having dinner here, make sure you arrive early or send one person to get your name on the guest list, because they don't do reservations. Trust me, it gets busy! I know that can be a little annoying but trust me it's worth the wait. The seating is limited but I hear they're moving to a new spot. If you have a large group, it might tough to seat everyone together. Anyways, now to the food. The menu is so simple and easy to navigate through. Our table ended up getting the fresh rolls, Kua Gling, Khao Soi and the Pad Thai. I personally ordered the Kua Gling and I loved it. You can pick your spice level you'd like for your dish and I usually claim to be good with spicy food but their Thai Spicy had me on my knees. The flavour is just amazing and the quantity is great as well. I got to to try a bit of the Khao Soi and it was delicious! The service was great and the server was really helpful. The manager even came and asked us how we like everything. The only flaw I could point out was towards the end, they seemed desperate to turn over the table and I understand with things being that busy but it just seemed like they were kind of hawking over us. Overall, I'd go back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"BAM. Prepare to have the best Thai food in the city. 

I came here with a friend and we tried pretty much everything. We ordered the crispy fried noodles, shrimp chips and fresh rolls with chicken sausage as appetizers; all of them were great. This is one of my favourite things about this restaurant - they actually have authentic Thai food! Thank god. Don't get me wrong, I love Westernized Thai food but it's nice to try traditional, genuine Thai cuisine too. For our main course we shared the red curry and Chef's Special Pad Thai. The pad thai was unreal. I have been to Thailand (twice) and honestly, it totally beat the pad thai there.

The only downfall to this restaurant is how crowded it is and the long wait time (you can't make reservations). On the upside, if you sign up to the waiting list they'll take your cell # and text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"We ordered: Massaman Curry (William) and two Khao Soi's. Level two spicy for my friends (average) and level six spicy for me (Thai Spicy).

Food: Khao Soi was pretty spicy! I like spicy food and this was pretty hot. The server asked me if I was sure like twice. The noodles sit in this milky, thick, spicy soup and there's a lovely mess of crunchy noodles on top. A healthy amount of chicken slices and fish tofu are distributed throughout the dish. 

The massaman curry seemed pretty standard, although it had a lot of potato balls in it, which is nice if you're into that thing.

Service: I read a lot of reviews that lambasted the service. Service here was fine. 10 minute wait, sat down, got menus, got our orders, paid at the front. Waters filled reasonably often but not often enough if you can't take the heat. The place is really lively, so I expect to be left alone for the most part.

Conclusion: Nice place to go with a group of people. I would avoid an intimate date here. Food is good, if you're into Thai food. It has all the coconut milk goodness, but I wasn't blown away. The thai milk tea is really good though! would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Came due to rave reviews from friends but the visit disappointed a bit.

Unfortunately they ran out of their fresh rolls (which sound amazing) so we converted to a papaya salad instead. Unfortunately it was a bit overseasoned and too much fish sauce overcame all other taste. Their garlic shrimp appetizer however was fantastic and would highly recommend to all- crispy, perfectly fried, extremely tender and flavourful with an excellent spicy dipping sauce.

The Bangkok style pad thai was unfortunately also over seasoned, and there was a distinct lack of acidity and sweetness that I've normally found in traditional pad thai sauces. Noodles were slightly soft and overcooked. Very little chicken was also in the pad Thai. Portion sizes were good and price overall was not bad. Service suffered a bit from the restaurant being so busy but never felt neglected. Friendly wait staff made things easy.

Perhaps it was an off night but would return to try some other dishes given some of the excellent reviews this place has had!"}
{"text":"Be ready for a line up ad it is a popular joint. we ordered the fresh roll, three flavour pad thai, and curry. The food is very rich and a bit heavy. I love the Thai milk tea, but the pad Thai and curry are not the best I have had is not . I don't think I will go again unless it's with friends. Pad Thai was $15 - I would rather try their other signature dishes."}
{"text":"came here with a friend who is gluten and dairy. generally thai food is a safe zone for her but her choices were more limiting here since they have a no-modifications policy for one of their pad thais that had egg as an ingredient. 

having said that, she got the other pad thai that she really enjoyed and i got the no-modifications one. i love the interior of the space. it's honestly not as good as Sukho Thai but would come back nonetheless."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service.

Go to Sukhothai on Wellington for similarly great food, and great service."}
{"text":"It is the best Thai food restaurant in Toronto!!! I was so happy when me friend texted me their grand opening. I ordered both Bangkok Style Pad Thai and Pad Gra Prow in medium, they all tasted amazing, especially the Pad Gra Prow!!! The big difference between Pai and Khao San Road is the beef texture in Pad Thai, Pai is more tender while Khao Shan Road is more chewy, personally I prefer my beef taste like beef, so Khao Shan Road yay!!! :p"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. The wait sucks and the space is really small with somewhat inconvenient seating. It's worth the wait if you're craving Thai, though."}
{"text":"I really liked their food even tho this restaurant is extremely packed and almost every time I had to wait for at least 15mins. However their service is good, food comes fast and therefore I found the wait to be worth it.

Garlic Shrimp - very crispy and the shrimps were medium size and fresh, it comes with a heat that we loved it

Bangkok Style Pad Thai - I ordered an spicy level 8, which almost killed me but I enjoyed it a lot. I would say level 8 is for those that can really take spiciness, if not, 4 is good for normal people.

Khao Soi - This is going to be a must-try. It comes with two type of noodles, one crispy one like pad thai in a bowl of creamy rich yellow curry that nowhere has it. Very unique.

Will def come back for Khao Soi and their Thai creamy milk tea."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here too many times. The Khao Soi is the most delicious item on the menu. The squash fritters are really good to start as well. The food is very flavorful and the right portions. The only bad part of the experience is the wait times which can be quite ridiculous. Mengrai is the only rival to this as the best Thai in the city. 4/5 as the only negative is that some of the curries are too similar in taste."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in Toronto! Everything is great about this place - the staff, the ambiance, and most of all the food. Boy it is good. Fresh, high quality ingredients, and loaded with flavour.. Everything on the menu is a winner. There is a constant line up at this place, from open to close, but it's worth the wait! Put your name down and grab a coffee at Little Nicky's down the street."}
{"text":"Easily among the top Thai restaurants in the city if not the best. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, the green curry and pad kee mao are two personal favorites but the pad gra prao and khao soi are also incredible. I'm looking at the menu as I write this review and I actually can't see anything I've had that I did not love."}
{"text":"Khao San road has fallen from grace for me. No longer a regular here.  I had veg cold rolls and they were so bland - just shredded carrots lettuce and rice noodle pretty much.   Served with a tamarind sauce.  Then I hand the green curry and it was just bland. They put potato in it with a lot of bamboo.  Hardly any tofu."}
{"text":"Got really bad food poisoning after eating the green curry with veggie and tofu and the squash fritters. :'("}
{"text":"I (heart) Khao San Road. It's a wonderful choice for anyone who is vegan/vegetarian with friends who eat meat has they have a great selection for both. They also recently created a separate vegan/vegetarian menu!

The MUST TRY for a vegan or vegetarian would be the Gaeng Massaman curry. Please note it's not on their vegan menu but the server asked if I wanted it vegan so I guess it's possible - and It's to die for. It's very filling but if you're super hungry I suggest splitting the garlic tofu nuggets to start. To drink, if you order coconut water it comes in a giant glass! 

I also tried the yellow curry for takeout lunch, the portion size is much smaller than dinner or maybe in this rare case my eyes were smaller than my stomach - or maybe it was just the takeout containers. It also didn't beat out the Gaeng Massaman for taste.

Atmosphere is super chill, great to go with friends, parents, or a date. I went on St. pattys and the owner came around and chatted with us for a bit, he was very friendly :)

Go before 6:30pm if you don't want to wait an hour for a table! And don't call them when you're hung over on a Saturday morning as they sadly don't do delivery :("}
{"text":"I can find nothing wrong with Khao San Road.  Maybe if I had a complaint, it would be that I unsuccessfully tried twice to get in there before I finally smartened up and made a reservation to avoid having to wait 45 minutes.  But that was my own fault for going at the busiest times expecting to find a table.

The Pad Thai (Street Style) was the most delicious pad thai I've ever tasted.  As the server explained, it doesn't come with the fancy toppings like chopped peanuts, but it was still delicious and had lots of flavour.  I don't know how to describe the flavour except for \"perfect\".  The \"spicy\" spice level was perfect for my taste buds - if you don't eat a lot of spice you would find it pretty spicy, but if you do enjoy spicy food, then it's got the kick but you won't be crying by the end of the dish.

The Khao Soi had a very tasty coconut broth and came with lots of crunchy fried stuff on top. The beef was nice and tender and there was a fair amount of beef in the dish.

The garlic chicken was nicely battered and deep fried without being overly greasy.

The service was quick and the server was friendly and helpful.

I will definitely be going back to try the rest of the dishes.

It's a little hard to spot the restaurant on the street because the sign isn't obvious from the sidewalk. If you're looking for it, it's next to Ravi Soups, which is a little easier to see."}
{"text":"Food:
Amazing.

Service:
On Point

Atmosphere:
Cool

Location:
Clubland? EW.

My friend and I went here last summer after our photoshoot in the islands, I had the pad thai and she had the pad gra prao (ground pork rice and egg kinda thingumajig) it was all yummy! I also had their thai iced tea. Decently priced meal, awesome atmosphere, great service. No wonder their empire is growing successfully!

Definitely would go back..... probably to Sukhothai instead, hate Clubland."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place as it looked busy, so they must be doing something right. 

The service was great. Took a while to get our food however. 

I got the phad thai. it was alright, but thai princess is better. A lot of their apps are very fried and i dont really like fried food. 

it was just ok for thai food. not to spacial but didnt make me sick either."}
{"text":"Experience a bit of Thailand... without having to fly across the world and kidnapping a drug muling monkey in a rolling stones jacket.

We had a great experience at this modern, trendy, but still casual dinner spot!  Even though there was a lineup and the place was packed, the service was prompt and the servers were helpful when explaining the menu.  

We had the Gra Bong ($9)
Deep fried squash fritters, a bit of curry spice and shrimp paste.
OMG, these were crispy, sweet, and super flavorful.  We could have eaten a second order.  Thai pakoras, yup, agreed.

Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw ( $6)
We chose these cold rolls as our (\"healthy\") not-fried item.
They were alright.  Nothing special.  Chicken, carrots, cucumber, you know the deal.

Green Curry ($12)
The curry was tasty, sweet ,and spicy.  A bit thin for my liking, but still a lot better than a lot of Thai places I've eaten at in the city.  The beef was very tender and yummy.

Khao Soi ($13)
This is the northern Thai favorite that everyone one raves about.  It was definitely the highlight of our meal.  This dish is magic... I don't know what it is... the egg noodles.. the coconut milk and curry..the crispy noodle things (that you want to eat before they get soggy).  Freaking delicious.

We were stuffed and very happy with our meal here.

Yes, I've been to Thailand.
And I think I actually like the food here better.
Too bad we can't have Thailand prices or maybe a massage thrown in for $5."}
{"text":"A long wait
A balanced palate
A funky tamarind curry
A road to spicy

Funny fact: Blinfold me and I would think I am at Sukhothai
Sad fact: The wait sometimes
Win fact: The curries"}
{"text":"Always a good selection when you want quality reasonable food . New location just opened up downtown. I order delivery from them. Great for take out."}
{"text":"Best thai place i've been to. Their food is so authentic and everyone is actually thai. Their thai ice tea and pad thai is so perfect. This is my go to thai resturant. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious and awesome atmosphere. Came for lunch from work and it was packed, but we got a spot at the shared table, which can be too loud to have a comfortable convo, but still manageable. Green curry was delicious, and my friend ordered the special rice dish with shrimp, which was incredible (forgot the name). Fresh rolls were interesting and good. Price is not cheap but not too expensive. $15 for the curry. Would come back for the ambiance and my friend's dish."}
{"text":"Yummy in my tummy. This is my favorite place to eat if I'm craving Thai food. Yes the line ups are crazy almost everyday, but trust me it's worth the wait! Their food is delicious, full of flavor and unique. It's a must if your in the downtown area."}
{"text":"We had to wait around 30mins. It was good that we didn't have to wait in line at the restaurant. We gave them phone number and when the table was ready, they called us. We shared one papaya salad with friends and had 2 dishes of padthai. The papaya salad came out quickly but we had to wait half an hour for the main course. The taste of food was good but nothing special than other Thai places and the price was expensive. We paid nearly $50 (tips included) for 2 dishes of pad thai and half of the salad dish. Next time, if we want Thai food, we will try other places."}
{"text":"Coming from a city with AWESOME Thai food, I can tell you this is the best in Toronto. No tomato sauce here! Enjoy the spicy pad thai and Singha beer! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Khao San Road is a great place to eat.  I often come here for lunch with my friend who works nearby.

My favorites are the curries and the beef Pad Gra Prao.  For the Pad Gra Proa I usually get the medium spice level, and somehow all the flavours and the spicyness just blend in together so well.  The proportion is perfect, just enough to feel satisfied.  

The curries are also amazing, very rich and flavorful each in its own way.  At some thai places all the curries taste almost the same, here each curry has a distinctive taste.  The Red curry and Massaman are my two favorite curries. 

I also like the Khao Soi---the beef is so tender--- but I would not recommend it for lunch as its too saucy and splashes out of the bowl too much... Also, I wish there were more noodles in the Khao Soi to balance out the really yummy curry sauce better.  

The Pad Thais, both the Sam Roas and the Street Style, are good but not great... The tamirand flavour is too overbearing for me. The pad thai at Thai Paradise on Baldwin was better I thought.  

The waitstaff are friendly, laid back and add to the overall great ambiance of this place."}
{"text":"Had the khao soi with braised beef. The dish was $14. The dish itself was delicious, and very heavy; I couldn't finish my entire meal. Very creamy and flavourful. 

Very authentic Thai food. I recommend this place, and the service is very quick. However, the wait time is around 45min on a regular weekday evening, and they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Having recently found Khao Soi, which is a curry-like dish served with egg noodles, lime and crunchy noodles on top, I have been on a mission to try the same dish in as many places as possible. Khao San Road was next.

The restaurant itself is quite small and the wait can be long, but the hostess is super friendly and the line moves fast. Once at your table, the menu itself is very simple and everything tastes great. The restaurant itself is quite noisy and during the summer, the shutters at the front are open which gives the place a nice airy ambiance.

The Khao Soi (see above) is excellent and can be ordered to your preferred spice level. We also tried the squash fritters which were very tasty.

The bill was about $40 for two mains and a shared starter which is expensive enough, but it's worth it.

A must try if you are in the Theatre District for a show or going to see a movie at Scotiabank Theatre!"}
{"text":"I am definitely going to have to agree with the mass majority on this one.

My friends and I came here on a whim after a holiday party, searching for some good thai food. After being turned away from a couple of other restaurants, who were about 30 minute+ wait. We decided to trek a little farther to Khao San Road. 

Upon arrival we were told that it would be about a 10 minute wait, tired and hungry at that point we happily accepted. About 2 minutes later, we were seated!
Khao San Road is about the size of a one bedroom condo in liberty village, but our party of 4 was seated in the corner, so it didn't feel squishy at all. 

For apps we had the \"som tam\" aka, papaya salad, and the squash fritters (can't remember the thai name for that, shame on me as I was just in Thailand this summer). Both were excellent, the som tam was just enough spicy with more spice on the side, if you like, that is. It was fresh and enough to split between 4 people. The fritters were also very good, light and tasty. 

For our entrees, we each ordered a different type of curry. There were two panangs, and one massaman, my other friend ordered the pad grao pao. All of which were excellent! Although each dish appeared small, it ended up being VERY filling. All the dishes were really authentic and service was quick and helpful as well. This is the first Asian place where I've felt like my 15% tip was well deserved.

At this point, dessert was a must. They only have ONE available, and I know why....its because its so delicious!! It was a coconut tapioca hot pudding. In Chinese also known as \"siye mi lo\", excuse my for my horrible chinglish. This was definitely an elevated version of the traditional dessert that I'm used to having at home. The coconut milk was really packed with flavour, and I liked the chunks of coconut they included. My friends thought it was too sweet, but I'm never a stranger to sugar, so I embraced the sweetness full on.

Khao San Road has earned their 5 stars, and I can't wait to bring my husband here to try again :)"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since I was there last, but I thought I'd share my experience.

I was fully aware of the longer wait times(checked their website as well) and tried to go earlier. The guy outside was friendly enough, wrote our names and said it'll take around 30 minutes. We went to grab a coffee and came back. Wait time is not a big deal. At least they don't make you freeze outside!
Unfortunately we got seated at the bar and we were told we had to wait around 15 more minutes if we wanted a table. We were both hungry and didn't want to wait longer.
Fortunately the guy at the bar was also quite friendly. I got the green curry which I think was the best I've ever had(*just to clarify, I'm not eating Thai food that often).
Overall, I'd say the place was quite good and charming. The music was fine, too.

In short:
Food: 4.5
Service: 4
Place: 3
I'd give it 3.5 stars because they could have given us a table. I guess they were waiting for a larger group."}
{"text":"Thai iced tea is crazy good; tastes just like Thailand!! Khao soy is absolutely amazing and so flavorful. One bowl isn't enough!"}
{"text":"Pad thai and squash fritters are great, fresh spring rolls are so-so at best.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sooooooooooooooooooooo crowded ! Oh my god. I made the giant mistake of taking my grandma and her friend here on a weekday around 130 pm and it was so crowded. No reservations. Luckily we didn't wait long. I heard their pad Thai was amazing so I wanted to check it out mostly for my own desire. I wish I hadn't. The service was sparse. Had to keep asking for water and the worst is that we were seated at a long table with q bunch of strangers. And since there were three of us we had a stranger sitting across from me making me feel like we were on a date or he was on a date with us. Hard to have conversation with all the jacked up suits and ties shouting for attention. Pad Thai was good but environment is also always very important to the food experience."}
{"text":"I LOVED the food here! We ordered the squash fritters and they were the best! The pad thai is their special but I'd say I had better! The portion is just right!! Service is fast and servers are very friendly! I would rate customer service as 5/5! 

The place has a great vibe and I would recommend it for a group of friends rather than a one to one date because it can get a bit loud! I sat on the bar and it was better than I expected! 

It is reasonably priced too! I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We got a table pretty quickly. They said it would be a 25 minute wait, but I think it was about 15 minutes! Service was great. I had the Thai iced tea, which was delicious. I also had the Bangkok pad thai with tofu and veggies. It was excellent and a decent sized portion as I couldn't finish it all! I ordered it spicy-3 and at first I thought that was perfect for me, but eventually realized it was a tad too spicy! I guess I cannot tolerate the spicy foods as well as I could in my younger days! ;) Still a great meal, and close to home so I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good service and nice ambiance. I got their bangkok styled pad thai and am very impressed. Finally a place that uses tamarind sauce! I live in the suburb and you wont believe that it's actually quite hard to find real authentic thai food there."}
{"text":"Best spot for Thai Food hands down.

tried their pad see ew- which is very delicious with broccoli and your choice of meat being the main items, but its SOOO flavorful and its filling

pad kee mao- this one is exactly like  pad see ew, with the same noodles, but more vegetables, and quite delicious, especially if you don't like broccoli. 

three flavours pad thai- its quite tasty but I still like my other noodle dishes, I just think pad Thai is the standard in Thai food, although there is way more to the Thai cuisine

yellow curry- its delicious and quite filling 

Tom Yum soup- spicy and flavorful

Thai iced tea- not for everyone, I love it but my friends don't like it, some say its heavy and some just don't like the different taste. It is a little heavier since its with condensed milk, but i personally love it, I cant find the right words to describe it but its sweet. also for the price comparing to other thai joints, its a great size

price is very reasonable for the food you get and the consistency is amazing, I have brought tons of friends here and they all loved the food equally. Plus all their dishes are filling and delicious.

haven't been to their new location, so I'm hoping its bigger."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the city! As authentic as I had in Bangkok.

The only negative - seeing all the people line up outside makes you wanna eat quickly and leave."}
{"text":"Quite a long wait (one hour) -- but it was a Friday night after all.
Great service, nice decor, but the ambience can be defined by its loud and friendly bustle due to how packed it is. (Probably not superb date material)
The friendly waiter gave us helpful and specific recommendations instead of the typical \"up to what you feel like eating\".  
Decent portions that leave you full and satisfied for your money's worth, but not yet bloated. 

Ordered Pad See Ew with beef (fried thick noodles) ($15?) and Pad Gra Prao (egg, meat, rice) with minced pork, medium spiciness ($16), along with an iced Thai tea ($4.5?). 

I've had Pad See Ew before, and i must say I really liked how sweet the sauce was and how smooth the flat noodles were in this one. 
Similarly, the Pad Gra Prao was well-flavoured in sauce and spice, and they gave generous helpings of pork to mix in with your rice. (Tastes quite like the minced pork in lettuce wraps in Northern Chinese cuisine) 
Thai tea was strong and sweet-- I was pleasantly surprised in the similarity between it and the street Thai tea I've had in Chiangmai. 

Overall, the wait was long, it felt a bit loud, and the food was a bit more expensive than I would like. But maybe these things made the experience better, and the food was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place. The khao soi is one of the best dishes I have had in any cuisine. Look forward to going back next time in town. Extra points for the quick service and old school hip hop playing."}
{"text":"Had the green curry, date had the red curry. Both were tasty, very creamy.

Dishes weren't heavy on the vegetables, in fact, it didn't appear there were any dominant fresh-veggie options. Some days I'm in the mood for lots of spicy veggie options, so was a bit disappointed.

Also, their spice levels are extremely diluted. I had a Thai hot that was not nearly as spicy as a medium back home, and my date had a hot that would barely qualify as mild. This supports impression that food has been heavily modified to fit the local tastebuds. Not authentic, but still tasty in its own right.

Most of the appetizers were fried, would appreciate some healthier options."}
{"text":"Good Thai food, not great. Lineups here are stupid long. You're better off going to Mengrai which is the best type food in the city and no trendy lineups."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. This is one of the two of my favorite Thai restaurants in Toronto (along with Pai). We have been eating here for years.
I love their Tom Yum soup. I order it every they have it on the menu (it is on rotation).
Also their Khao Soi, Pad gra prao, Pad see ew, Pad kee mao all are first rate. So are their curries.
I'm not a big fan of their green curry fried rice or pad thai.
They are always busy and do not take reservations so please accordingly."}
{"text":"Tasty food, friendly staff, cool decor, nice location. I was attacked in front of the restaurant and would have preferred going to Hooters a block away but nonetheless this restaurant was on par with the better Thai places I've been to outside of Thailand. Some recommendations: Getting there early (to avoid the large line we stood in), Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, Fried Squash, Singha!"}
{"text":"Such a great place food is great! My only complaint would be that it is sometimes quite hot in there but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Whenever you have a craving for papaya salad and pad Thai, this place will definitely hit the spot. Not the mention the squash fritters, thai iced tea and shrimp chips with their tamarind sauce. The only complaint I have is, the wait time is ridiculous! You have to go right at opening, so check their hours of operation and be one of first in line!!"}
{"text":"The service really soured our experience there. I got in, sat down, and everything was going great until my friend received her dish and I waited for another 15 minutes before the kitchen realized that something screwed up on the ticket and they FORGOT TO MAKE MY DISH!

So we sat another 15 more minutes while my friend's food got cold. They offered to keep it warm, but then they forgot where they put the soup.

It was one big WTF moment to the next.

At the end of it all, they didn't even offer to give us a discount of some sort to make up for all the crap they pulled.

In the end, the Sam's Pad Thai I took was delicious and very saucy, but with far too much oil. I couldn't eat more than 4 bites and I asked them to trash it.

I'd go back to give it another fair shot (I loved their condensed milk and tea teh tarik drink) but the service ruined it for me."}
{"text":"Great apps but super inflexible regarding allergies and entrée modification. Super cool vibe and overall look to the restaurant though. Great place to bring someone you're trying to impress!"}
{"text":"The pad thai was to sweet for my liking (sweeter than pad thai at any other restaurant I've  been to).   Though it was good it didn't set in my stomach well. 

Overall the staff is friendly and the food is good but the restaurant is small and seating is very limited."}
{"text":"The place is relatively small and crowded. We waited a long time to get our seats. They will refuse to seat you if you're entire group is not here which is reasonable given how busy it is. The food is quite inexpensive, each entree costing about 13-15 dollars. The food was also very crowd pleasing. I got yellow curry, i liked that it was a little sweet and I also got the option of making it mild which was important bc I can't handle spicey food. Overall I really enjoyed my food it was perhaps the best curry I had in a long time. My friends order green and red curry and they both liked their food. Pad Thai was also very good. They have very little options for drinks though. For alcohol it is just wine and one kind of beer. And you have your usual soft drinks. If you can it is best to reserve seats. We went on a Tuesday and there were still many people lining up! But the food was delicious so it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Look, I'm no stranger to Thai Food, and with me being from Thailand myself I'm pretty picky when it comes to what's considered good Thai food.  I decided to try their shrimp pad thai and to my surprise it had an authentic taste to it.  The added lemons, cilantro, peanut sauce, and tiger shrimp created a nice blend of flavours that bursted into my mouth with my very first bite.  

Oh and did I mention I like my pad thai spicy?  Yup, there different increment levels when ordering their food and the range goes from 1 to 7 I believe with 7 being the hottest.  I recommend 2 or 3 for the average person who normally don't do well with spices. 

The only true downside to this place is that the waiting line to get a seat or to pick up your take out order can be extremely long, and by long I mean 45 min. to an hour.  So if your looking for a quick sit down, be prepared to wait. The staff there are decent but are always in a rush, so don't expect top notch service either. 

In conclusion, if your truly critiquing the food and authenticity of the different selections they offer, they are right up there with some of the few street vendors who've served me pad thai right off the streets of the original Khao San Road.  They cater to the thai food lovers, the spicy tongue goons, and even the vegetarians.

Overall, this place gets 5 Stars, and I never give 5 stars to any restaurant!"}
{"text":"The menu is short and simple which makes ordering easy. I got the Friday special  - massaman curry. This dish was okay. The curry was thick and sweet, but a little bland. I would definitely like to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"A wildly inconsistent restaurant! I've tried it three times because their version of Khao Soi is outstanding. But other dishes range from mediocre to terrible. The Pad Thai here is mushy and tasteless, downright awful! And the service is consistently atrocious: incredibly slow, rude, and inefficient. They seem like they are still beginners. The one take-out order I had was missing one of the dishes I ordered and I was charged for something I didn't order in addition to the missing dish. With so many great Thai restaurants in Toronto, this one has become just too much trouble. Avoid it!"}
{"text":"The food is on point. Had the red curry and the pad see mao both very good. I almost gave this place 4 stars because of the seating and lighting but I don't want to be nit picky like that. You're most likely to sit on stools elbow to elbow with strangers. It was uncomfortable. And way too bright lights, it was dark outside the bright lights threw me really off. 
The atmosphere was no good, but the food was amazing and the service as well."}
{"text":"Ambience: 5/5 (Notes: Can be noisy and crowded for some. Worth waiting in line.)
Food: 5/5 
Service: 5/5
Value: 5/5 
Repeat: Always!"}
{"text":"I started going to Sukho Thai before Khao San opened and I think Khao San is a little better, despite having nearly the same menu. The ingredient quality is a little higher and there are slightly more vegetables and less sauce for your dollar. Usually packed, I don't even consider going with more than 1 other person."}
{"text":"Uuuuuggghhhh... I'm sooo full.

So I decided to get take-away from Khao San Road since I was in the area. I can see all the hype... Especially from the outside. 
Ermergerrd (Yah! I said it!)... soo many people! I'm glad to just get take away - not a fan of tightly packed restaurants. Gave them a call and my food was ready in 20 minutes.

I got:
Khao Soi Beef
- Phew! Couldn't stop eating it... Beef was soft and the combination of different textures and flavours were Awesome!
Chef's Chicken Pad Thai
- It IS one of the best in the city... Great flavour!  But there's a place much closer to me that is equally good and less expensive.

Definitely a great Thai restaurant... A must visit if you're in the area. But from seeing the seat set-up and the line-ups, KSR will be my take-away option."}
{"text":"Great great great food. I am a thai lover and the food blew my expectation. This is a must go in Toronto."}
{"text":"We just got back from Thailand and let me reassure you, THIS is the real thing. 

You MUST try their Pad Gra Prao. It's phenomenal. It all is really.

Expect to wait in line. Starting from 11:30am until it closes after dinner there WILL be a wait. You can get on the list and go down the street for a beer while you wait. 

Anyway, we've eaten a lot of Thai food, in a lot of restaurants around the city and THIS is the most authentic and the best.

5 big stars for this one."}
{"text":"Khao San Road's chef special pad thai pretty much blew my mind. The right amount of sweet but extra kick of spice definitely shored up the flavor explosion. Probably one of the best pad thai I've had. The yellow curry we've ordered was good too - but nothing extraordinary. The line could be long during dinner time but the upside is that they take down your number to ring you when you're up. You can head down the street to grab a beer while you wait."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on Wednesday at 11:50 with no reservations and were told to wait outside. However, the server saw that we were in a rush and offered our party of 2 a seat at the bar, which we gladly took. The party waiting behind us for table of 8 was less fortunate, and it took around 40 minutes before they could get seated.

After being seated at the bar, the server was not very attentive, which was understandable since the place was bustling. 

The tables were communal and seating space was too close together especially at the bar area, where elbow rubbing was bound to occur. Due to the fact that they cram as many people into one table as possible, it can get very loud, and you may find it hard to have a proper conversation. 

My friend and both ordered the bangkok style pad thai (mild). It took around 25 minutes for the noodles to be delivered to our table. But when it did, the noodles were piping hot and really good. However, after few bites in it got really greasy and had a tart flavour that I didn't quite enjoy. Was not a fan of the pickled radish in the dish, which gave a very salty and sour taste.   

However, I have heard great reviews from other friends about their three flavours pad thai and khao soi which I will come back to try."}
{"text":"I am giving a mixed review for Khao San Road... I personally believe their 'stardom' needs to be kicked down a few notches so that they are forced to learn some customer service skills.

First, they don't take reservations. Clearly they are busy. And not busy in a normal busy kind of restaurant way, busy in a \"you might have to wait in line for 2 hours outside in the freezing cold because we don't take reservations\" kind of way. Would it be so hard? Hey, it's not my place, but this is the one thing which will prevent me from ever going back. 

I was meeting friends at Khao, and as usual, I'm the first to arrive, so I get in line. Realizing that there's \"a list\", I figure, this will be no problem, we'll get on the list and go grab a drink, come back and have dinner. Well, nope! The hostess with the mostest attitude has decided that she doesn't have time for the list anymore (I think that she was extremely overwhelmed). YOU MUST WAIT IN LINE. Period. She even stopped acknowledging people in line, or trying to give anyone hope or estimates of what time we might be expecting to get a table. After about 40 minutes, my friends finally decide to join me. In total, I waited nearly an hour and forty minutes to get my dinner. I was hangry beyond anyone's imagination. 

The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars, and not 1, is because the food... oh, the food. It was unbelievably delicious. Each dish was complex with multiple flavours being tossed in your mouth with each spoonful, leaving your brain happy, confused and longing for more. The food was good. The wait for the food was not.

LESSON: Order takeout."}
{"text":"I've been to Khao San Road a few more time since my previous review and le sigh...it's always worse and worse. The tables are shared and extremely squished (as before) but now the guy at the door always seems to try to squish you in the smallest space possible - not comfortable at all. You also feel super rushed and in the winter there is a really tiny hook under the table for both your jacket and your purse (and if your jacket is long, it is likely going to be partly on the floor). Before when Chef Nuit was there, it was really good but now it's gone downhill -_-\" I would much rather walk a block down and go to Pai."}
{"text":"Not the easiest place to find, but it is certainly worth it. Right up there with the best Thai restaurants I found in Oz/NZ, and that's a very good thing!  Had the green curry at level 3 spice, and it certainly did not disappoint.  Great laid-back atmosphere while still being hip.  Ingredients all very fresh and the dish had a very nice balance of flavors."}
{"text":"This place deserves it great rating due to it's Khao Soi dish, service and atmosphere. 

Be on the lookout when arriving at this place because their sign is in cursive in blue letters.. And quite small. There's a public parking lot across the street. 

We came about 7pm and got our name on the list and was seated in 20 minutes. The Khao Soi dish was a great hit! Butttttt the pad thai was kindof mediocre. They have a small selection of wines and prepare to sit with other people. They do shared tables like in Asia. 

Normal spicy palate: go with a 3 spicy level"}
{"text":"The food is great and the decor is awesome. 

However, for the price point and the amount of food they give, I think you would be better off going to salad king for a larger portion size, similar decor and larger space. The location is also wanting, as it's a bit out of the way for most people."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch - from work and I wasn't very satisfied. 

the food was okay - the service was even slower.

I ask for bottled waters twice and she brought me tap water each time. not sure if there was a language barrier or if she was the waitress was just not listening. which really bothered me.

the food was okay, it wasn't that flavoured and because we were sat outside there were bugs everywhere. I asked to move inside but they said they didn't have room for a while so it was just an annoying experience."}
{"text":"People were not exaggerating - The food here is delicious and the taste is authentic! Service was excellent - our waitress was extremely attentive. It was my first time trying to khao soi and I guess I looked confused as to how to eat it (you have to mix it :$) because she approached me without me having to grab her attention :)

The only thing that stops me from giving 5 stars is the price. My friend and I each only ordered a main, and the bill with tax and tips came up to almost $40 :( Considering how this is a kind of \"fast\" food joint, it's definitely a bit pricey. 

Within 15 mins from it opening for dinner, there was a lineup. Definitely come early or expect to wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.
The portions are bigger than i thought. Especially the squash frites. They come looking like a huge ball of tumbleweed all tangled together.

Amazingly tasty"}
{"text":"I went there after hearing how great this place is.  However, to my disappointment, the taste/quality of the food does not correlate with the high price tag that they come with.  The place is so noisy that it is hard to chat with anyone (with all the noises from people chatting, they still put on loud music!!).  The place is so crowded so it is uncomfortable to dine when they put more people than they should on one long bench table.  I will not visit there again - there are better Thai food places with reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be a couple years back... still not bad. Decen thai food at a decent price, can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I ordred Pad Thai, and it looked nothing like Pad Thai. My noodles were just one big blob of mush... never going there again"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place since forever but never actually knew where it was until Kathy H bought me here for a quick bite to eat. At that time we shared a quick main and headed off. 

Since returning my initial thoughts are still the same, gets too busy, not a big fan of communal tables. They need to play some hiphop beats.

They have a good range of spicy levels and i am all about spice."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Go to PAI instead!  THe original owners and chef of Khao San Road opened up their latest Thai restaurant called PAI on Duncan and it is awesome!  Their green curry in coconut bowl was delicious.

As for Khao San Road, my expectations were very high due to the number of reviews and the four star rating...perhaps that was my problem.  The food was too sweet and the dishes I had were meh.  Nothing to write home about.  I have had better pad thai and definitely better curry elsewhere.  Overrated... the new owner and chef of this place has brought the quality of the place down several stars."}
{"text":"We've been here twice while on trips to Toronto.  It's a great place if you're looking to get away from the \"same-ole same-ole\" ubiquitous Thai offerings that can pretty much be found anywhere.

Golden curry is delicious and comes in a large white bowl served over noodles.  The Penang is quite different from what you might be used to (good or bad depending on your view) and comes in little boat.  It's not heavy on the sauce or peanuts (again, it's a different twist)  More rice to eat it with would have been nice.  Actually, the same goes for the noodles in the Golden curry.  If you come with an appetite and don't have an appetizer you might be hungry as you walk away from your meal.

A note on the seating policy.  Both times we've come there's been a wait.  The estimated wait times should just be removed from the website as they've been wrong both times. It's probably better just to say that you'll wait - about 30 minutes for us on each visit.  Don't bother trying to leave your cell number to text or call - on a busy night the hostess will flat out tell you that she's not going to be able to call you.

That said, the hostess, same young woman both times, is VERY efficient and doesn't miss a beat.  My advice for the easiest seating experience:

1) Do as the sign outside says - wait for the hostess to come out to you. She will so don't worry.  If you are the type that demands immediate attention and wants special treatment... skip Khao San Road all together, you probably don't belong there.

2) Make sure EVERYBODY is there when it's time to be seated.  Having watched people try to scout this policy on two occasions I am happy to say that the seating hostess is unyielding on this - and I'm glad!  The tables turn over quickly here so don't play games with the seating process.

3) Do have someone go to the restaurant to get on the list ahead of time.  If she says that you have a wait of 20 minutes and can stay or go for a walk... do either, but arrive back on-time and all together.  If not, expect your table to be given away and then you'll be bumped to the next in line for your party size.

4) If you are doing a 12 person birthday dinner I'd either get there right when they open or find another place.  It's a small restaurant and they pack you in.  If that is going to spoil your party then do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

5) You could end up seating at a communal table.  It adds to the atmosphere.  If you are so misanthropic that you can't stand the idea of sharing a table.... you know what to do!

Other little things to note:

A) Your server will give you the check but you pay at the bar at the rear of the restaurant.

B) The restaurant is an easy walk - perhaps 5 to 10 minutes at most to Second City and other venues in the Entertainment District.  Great place to eat before a show, just give yourself time.

C) Be nice to the seating hostess.  Having watched her operate for the better part of an hour on two visits, I've seen her get plenty of attitude from rude diners.  I thanked her on my way out after dinner.  I appreciate someone who is efficient, sets realistic expectations, and then plays fairly.  It's not hard to act like a decent person - especially now that you have some tips! (I gleaned many of these from other Yelpers before our first visit... just wanted to make a comprehensive list and bump it to the top!)

In summary, good food, fun atmosphere, play by the rules, and only 4 stars because of the price to portions of the food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat for the price.  The food is fresh, the portions are good, and the quality is great.  This place has a youthful vibe and gets quite busy so you'll have to come early/late for quicker seating but it's worth the effort.  The noodles, curries, and spring rolls were all very tasty.  They don't have a tonne of options on the menu but what they do have, they do well.  This is a fun little spot."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, but the last visit was a bit of a let down. I ordered the 3 flavour pad thai - medium spice and it was okay. The chicken was a bit dry. But I think it was just a one off. All the other times I've been here, the food has been amazing. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place gets pack fast. I had the Thai ice tea and I like it. Beware, it is super sweet. So, if you're not a fan of super sweet drinks than I don't recommend it to you. I had the pad Thai. It's not the best. I didn't like it. The green curry chicken on the other hand was delicious."}
{"text":"Red curry and brew, very tasty! Arrived just after 5:00 reopen...staff was solid and prices reasonable for the area. I recommend you hit it. 57"}
{"text":"absolutely the the food and the vibe. recommend their signature dishes. the food was so good i forgot to take pictures of it!! friends n i sat the a good part of the night and talk and did not feel rushed. love this place!"}
{"text":"Delish, and not too pricy. Arguably the best thai in Toronto. Make sure you have  a reservation, because it's packed every night."}
{"text":"Wanted to be treated like garbage?
Want to get kicked out after paying your bill?
If so, Khao San Road is the place for you.

I took my date to Khao San Road after seeing high number of reviews on Yelp. As soon as I sat down, I was embarrassed that I took her here. I saw the owner of the restaurant eating food with his bare hands between serving food to customers. It was disgusting. The food portion was very small and the service was the worst. The small portion kind of helped because it was really bad. It was insanely salty. I was thinking that this was really bad for my health. (I remember chugging down water all day after leaving Khao San Road). I always finish my food. In fact I always order second bowl of rice when having curry. (Curry lovers know what I'm talking about). I could not finish my curry. It was that bad.

When it was time for me to pay the tip, I gave them what they deserved. I paid the bill. The owner then came upto me and demanded that I should be paying more tip. I refused as it was \"tip\" and I get to decide how much tip I should be giving them. He then kicked me out of the restaurant. It was freezing outside but I had no choice. He then told one of his employees to stay outside to watch me. He kicked me out and found a way to harass me even after I was outside.
I had to go to the washroom after my meal, but I couldn't. My date was still in the washroom when I got kicked out. They would not let me wait for my date inside. She was very curious why I was waiting for her outside when it was freezing.

This place has unusual amount of reviews even for a well-known restaurant in downtown Toronto. I don't know what the owner did, but Yelp should do something about reviews that are not organic."}
{"text":"Awesome good and a great atmosphere and decor. But it gets busy fast! It would be tough to get a spot during peak hours, it's just that popular"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. I've been here 5 times since trying it out in June. Don't let the line discourage you, it's an average of 15-20 minutes and it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"was thinking of a very casual place to have diner with a friend, turned to my trusty yelp app, picked Khao San Road out of a few others, decided to give it a try, and we were not disappointed. 

The service was warm, friendly and quick. The food was delicious - full of flavors, spices and aromatics.

Highly recommended and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST restaurant experience I have EVER had.
The food is good -- but their customer service is terrible.

There was an open 2-person table beside us -- and me and my gf wanted to sit there instead of the communal table.  Hostess was rude and unaccommodating -- and the manager (I think he was the manager) pretty much told us to leave if we didn't want to sit at the communal table.

I get it, your restaurant is always full, so who cares how you treat your customers requests -- right???  Well success has gotten to their head and I wouldn't be surprised if this strategy backfires.

If you go there, be prepared for good food but absolutely atrocious service from the hosts/management (waitress and other staff were actually very good and polite)."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best Thai curry and noodles of your life, look no further! We tried multiple menu items and loved everything! Their curry is spicy just how it should be. The atmosphere was very eclectic and fun. We can't wait to return next time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Based on yelp reviews that we read we decided to order the green curry, pad Thai and squash fritters. We had super high expectations about the place given the multiple rave reviews. The green curry we found very watery, and the taste wasn't as fragrant or as memorable as we were expecting. The pad Thai was better,  it had a pleasant sweetness to it and took up most of our eating attention. The squash fritters tasted pretty much like a lesser version of sweet potato fries, though not as crispy or as good sans any spicy mayo."}
{"text":"I didn't know Thai food could taste this good. True story.

Shared Street Style Pad Thai as well as Khao Soi. Yes, we had to line up, and yes it was packed, but I forgot all of that when I took a bite of $15 heaven. 

Pad Thai was good; Khao Soi was better. I did not eat the dish - I injested it, leaving embarrassingly little of the succulent beef and accompanying noodles for my friend to fish out of the coconut curry sauce. Not that I left much sauce, either. The tangy, creamy, spiced coconut aroma still haunts me even now.

I will come back, and try to share better. The Khao Soi was big enough to split, and the Pad Thai was good enough to have again. So still a pragmatic decision."}
{"text":"Finally got to come back to this place after they moved to their new location.  It was crazy-busy inside but thankfully there was room for 2 more people.  But we ended up sitting at a large table so if you're thinking of coming here to eat, you could be eating right next to strangers.  And the stools they have on hand are not very comfortable.

One of my new go-to Thai staples is pad see ew.  So I ordered it here but was disappointed to find out that they didn't have any pork on hand that day.  I ordered it with chicken and any disappointment I had about them not having any pork on hand that day disappeared quickly as it was a fantastic dish.  The noodles were of the perfect texture, the chinese broccoli was perfectly crisp yet tender, and everything had a beautifully smoky flavour.  And the dish itself was a nice mix of hot, sweet, sour (from the lime wedge they give you to squeeze all over it), salty, and umami.  Fantastic.

The meal ended on another disappointing note though because apparently they didn't have any desserts.  Ah well.  Can't win them all I guess."}
{"text":"The food here is good, I'm not going to take away from it... is it worth the huge wait and having to deal with not being able to split the bill... probably not. I enjoyed the food, but I doubt I'll go back, it's not worth the effort."}
{"text":"Totally lives up to all the 5 star reviews! The food is incredible, best Thai I've had (and I've had plenty). We've only gotten the Pad See Ew with Shrimp or Chicken and Pad Thai. Both full of kicked up flavor versus other Thai. Long wait during regular dinner hours, this time we went exactly at opening time of 5:00 and were immediately seated. We went out of our way to drive to Toronto from a vacation spot north of the city to go to Khao San road for our second visit; we will come here every time we visit from the US."}
{"text":"very great food at a decent price. 

the waiters are nice and the restaurant it self is nicely decorated.

The problem with all of this is the fact that many people similarly find this place quite good, just like me. So because of this there are line ups out the door, but you have to try this place at least once.

food 5/5 
price 4/5
decor 4/5
service 4/5"}
{"text":"Would be a 5 but for their inability to handle their capacity.
This place has amazing food and Toronto knows it. The kitchen is always backed up and phone calls to them never go through.
But that's the scene, and hard to blame them for just being SO popular.

They have a vegan menu which is great bc many thai places use fish/ oyster sauce even in what appears to be veg.

Everything I've tasted has been great.
A bit overpriced for the portion size, but the realistic portion size is welcome. 
You'll never be disappointed... as long as you can wait for tour food."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Good cost benefit. Nice service. I've been a couple of times and tried 4 different dishes, we liked all very much. The tamarind curry was my favorite although the egg noodle curry special was great as well! Looking forward to the next visit!

I have to edit this comment to say that the service can be bad and that the hostess is not good. Beware."}
{"text":"I have had many things here and everything is amazing. For starters, I've had their fresh rolls, papaya salad, crispy rice salad, and squash fritters. I highly recommend their papaya salad as it's fresh, tangy and delicious! For their mains, I've had their spicy green curry, spicy panang curry, Thai spicy massaman curry, pad thai, pad see ew, pad kee mao, khao soi, and pad gra prao. I recommend all their curries. Their massaman curry is my personal favourite and I always up the spice level for it because it's a slightly sweet curry. Their pad thais are nothing to write about but their pad see ew is really good. My sister's favourite is the pad kee mao. I've never been a huge fan of khao soi so I can't recommend it. If you want rice, pad gra prao is amazing! Overall, my go-to is their papaya salad and Thai spicy massaman curry."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food.

Can't go wrong here. But had to wait 45 minutes for a table, which is sayin' something..that it's worth it.

Red Curry was good, Pad Thai even better. However, should be more generous with the rice when you order the curry."}
{"text":"awesome awesome awesome food... just one catch- huge line up... but who cares when the wait is worthwhile ...i sure dont care how much time i have to wait when i am getting to eat such wonderful food."}
{"text":"Disappointing and expensive food.  We came here for lunch. The Khao Soi (13.5 + .5 for spice) was really really bad. The chicken Pad Krapow (13.5 + 1 for the egg, subtitution for beef is extra) was mediocre. The lunch combo upgrade (3.75) comes with a teeny tiny soup and 1 roll, it was alright. Oh by the way they don't provide extra basil, even if I was willing to pay for it. The bill came to $43 after tax and tip!  and this is for their lunch menu on a weekday!

regarding the extra spicy chili oil (.5 extra), we didn't like it. not only was it not spicy enough, it turned the dish into an oil rig. Our mistake for ordering it. we expected it to be more amount of heat per volume of oil, and didn't expect that much oil in the bowl.

We used to boycott the old location after hearing rumors of the sudden departure of the original chefs Nuit and Jeff Regular, due to business conflicts with their 3rd partner. Despite that, we decided to give this new location a try, and to our disappoibtment the food was subpar. This 1 star review is for the food quality and value only.

A positive aspect was that the new location looks great and I loved the tile decorations and solid wood tables."}
{"text":"In an epic battle on Adelaide... Khao San Road won me over as I was on my way to Ravi Soups.  Best choice I made that weekend!

I stepped in on a crowded Friday lunch hour and was able to snag a seat at the bar.  I had heard SO MUCH about this place and jumped right into the somewhat zany menu and got the Khao Soi - a fantastic coconut curry dish with super tender beef.  I fell in love.  The next day... couldn't help but go right back in for a Saturday lunch!  Shared a pad thai and a green curry.  As expected - both were fantabulous!  

I love how these guys have a slim menu and focus on doing just a few things really well as opposed to just throwing the who's who of Thai food at you!  I would highly recommend this to anyone that has a Thai craving!"}
{"text":"My favourite thai place that I always go back to. The wait could be bit long, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The \"new-er\" location is a lot nicer than the old place, and there's definitely more room to sit. However, there's still most likely going to be a wait when you get there so be prepared for that. The food, like before is ALWAYS delicious and great. When they say spicy...they mean spicy though! So make sure you've prepared yourself if that's what you ask for, or get some Thai Iced Tea to sooth your fiery taste inside your mouth like I did! :)"}
{"text":"After just one time visting this is clearly the front runner of Thai food in Downtown Toronto. BTW, I haven't been able to make to Salad King yet. 

This place is exetremely busy all the time. The food is fresh and wonderfully seasoned; plently depth of character. I will go back to sample much more of the menu. The only downside was that there no Thai Iced Tea ready."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 3 at 5:30pm on a saturday.  The place was getting busy already.  We ordered the pad thai, green curry chicken and another noodle dish which i was not a fan of.  I did not enjoy my experience here as the dishes were small and overly saucy, and it was just an uncomfortable experience overall as we were put in a communal table and the 3 of us were squished!  Prices weren't good here either.  I'd rather go to Thai express than come back."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a weekday . I did a take out . The food was certainly better than any other Thai place I have tried in downtown. 
Friendly staff .. The food is a little costly though."}
{"text":"The wait here is incredible, and the food is alright.

The first time I went, I had the Khao Soi noodle with medium spicy... very creamy, super tender beef and yummy noodles. It was a bit too creamy for me, actually, but the fried crispy noodles on top was amazing and the beef was so yummy.
My friend got bangkok-style pad thai and to be honest, it was pretty normal. I have eaten pad-thai from terrible faux thai places before, and it wasn't much better than those.

The service was GREAT, even despite all the people! :)
I would've given the place 4 stars for the first time. 

The second time I went, I got the spicy beef salad - again, medium spicy. It was so spicy I almost started crying! It was also pretty pricy - I was going to pay $16 after tax and tip. The service was also pretty bad this time - I say \"going to\" because she said I only tipped her 40 cents, when I really tipped her two dollars and forty cents (around 15%) for her subpar service. More about her service later. First, let's talk about this... I thought her comment was strange because 1. she did the math wrong, obviously, and 2. who asks the customer for more tips? Even if I had tipped her 40 cents, do people actually ask customers for more tips? I always tip 10 (if it was seriously terrible) to -20%, depending on the waiter/waitress so I guess I wouldn't know. But I found it a bit rude to ask people for more money, even if it is kind of obligatory - like asking people to bring money when you attend their wedding service + reception.
I gave her an extra two dollars after this complaint, so I ended up paying $18 for an appetizer that really wasn't worth it. I just wanted to get the heck out of there after waiting for 1.5 hours total for being in the line of people to eat, for the dishes to come, for the bill. I could definitely recreate the beef salad at home. Oh well, now I know.

Now, to her service.

First of all, we wanted to sit next to each other on the booths but she wouldn't allow us, saying the side seats are for \"groups of 3\". She made my friend move to my opposite side, where we had to literally yell to hear each other. The seat next to me stayed empty the ENTIRE TIME. Yes, I was a bit annoyed about that. 
Secondly, she was really slow with the bill - like, really really slow. We asked for the bill ahead of time (since I knew from last time it'd be slow) but still ended up waiting for 10 minutes after we finished our bill.

This wasn't that great of an experience - I'd give it a 2-star \"meh, I've experienced better\" because of the bad experience, due to poor service, overcharging, unable to converse properly with my friend and seriously overpriced beef salad. And it's honestly only a 2 star because my friend made it better. We laughed at everything together - if I went with a less silly friend, it'd be a 1 star for sure. I felt really sorry for the friend I brought there. She looked awkward having to yell our convo and also overhear the dating convos next to us (I almost choked myself when I heard the couple on my right ON THEIR FIRST DATE talk about sex. @@)"}
{"text":"Before our trip to Toronto, I've done a lot (and i mean A LOT) of research before deciding on Khao San Road. 
So here we are, starving and tired after all day of walking around Toronto. We got to the restaurant and were greeted by a group of people waiting their turn to be seated. After few minutes the waitress / hostess came out to take our names. It took about 30 min from the time we got there to the time we were seated at the table (not bad).
We ordered yellow and panang curry, which was delivered to our table within probably 15 min (if not less).
The food itself was delicious! Flavorful, spicy, colorful, well presented, and did i say delicious?!
Our water glasses were constantly refilled by a very nice and attentive yet not noisy waiter. 
This place might get loud, especially in the back of the restaurant where we were seated, so if you don't like noise you might want to ask for a table outside or closer to the front.
I would definitely visit Khao next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Lets get the one negative thing I have to say about this place out of the way first....killer line up to get in, and doesn't take reservations. There that's it

Bold statement: BEST THAI FOOD in TORONTO

The atmosphere is young, hip, trendy. However, there were people from all age groups from 20 somethings up to folks in their 50s/60's dining when I visited. 

The owners are very pleasant and really take to speaking to their patrons in a way I haven't seen since I was a kid and my dad knew the chef at our fav Italian dinner spot. My date and I enjoyed a fantastic conversation with one of the two for quite some time.

We both had the Spring rolls to start followed by the famous Pah Thai and it didn't disappoint. Good amount of meat and shrimp in mine and everything was cooked beautifully. So filling that I did something I never do in a restaurant... I couldn't finish my main and had to ask to have it packed up for me (there was still enough food for a full lunch the next day).

Really great is the levels of heat. I asked for medium and then upped the ante with a side of their hot sauce and added what the owner said was more than the HOT receives (I was still standing). However he invited me to come back another time and attempt their \"Thai Spicy\" level. Challenge Accepted Khao San Road.

One last note that made a world of difference: A succinct menu. Most experiences I have had at Asian restaurants be it Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai, etc. is their menus are 6 pages and 500 items long. Who has the time or desire to look through all that when you are doubled over with hunger. KSR keeps it short and simple and what they have they do very very well. 

Thanks again for a great meal, I will be back again - many times."}
{"text":"This place is a very tremendous 4.5/5.

Our server was super helpful with meal suggestions and how spicy we should get them. She was also really attentive and was quick to fill our waters as soon as it dipped below the halfway point. Khao San Road usually has a couple of servers on hand, all whom looked like they were taking care of their customers well. Khao San Road is one of the few places I actually voluntarily want to give 20% tip because of the super great service.

I have never had a better Pad Thai dish anywhere in Toronto that can match up to the one at Khao San Road (note: I haven't been to Pai yet but I hear their Pad Thai is also quite good). The Green Curry is less creamy compared to most of the places I've been to, is less sweet and it has more of the lime leaf taste. It was different but not necessarily my favourite taste palette for a green curry. I heavily recommend getting the Khao Soi, curry base with egg noodles, and the Thai Iced tea. 

This restaurant is really busy most of the time and lineups usually start even before they open. Keep that in mind as you plan your trip. There are 5 two-person tables and a bar space if those are full. I believe they are relocating to a larger location in the near future (~March 2016) so it should be much easier to get a seat after the move. They also have a sister restaurant called Nana which will might be interesting to check out."}
{"text":"You haven't had Thai food (in Toronto) if you haven't eaten here ... enough said!"}
{"text":"This is not the same Khao san road of  before - we got out favourites and they were all disappointing. The khao soi was overridden with tumeric and the massaman curry had very thin slices of beef (compared to the large thick pieces at the older place).

I may try the menu at the upstairs cocktail bar but if I am craving Thai I'll check out Pai or SukhoThai instead."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from this place on Saturday night. The first thing the person on the phone told us was that it would take 50mins as they were really busy. So if you do want to order in the evening, keep that in mind.

For appetizers, we got the Fried Garlic Chicken and chicken sausage spring rolls. Both were very good, but would recommend not getting the Chicken for takeout as it would taste better hot. For mains we got Green curry chicken (prolly best in the city), panang curry tofu and the special pad thai. all were delicious. 

As with the other reviews, when we got there to pick up our order, there was a lineup out the door. Notwithstanding how busy the place was, the food was good. Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Another review to the thousands who are raving about this place.

FOR Vegetarians ask them for Vegan/Vegetarian menu. 
Beware of the spice level. I ate medium which was perfect. Hubby ate thai spicy and it was too HOT!!! But we loves it.

Drinks were okay."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after seeing many good reviews. There was a long line up so we gave the host our names for him to call us when there are spaces available. The host was pretty rude and talked to us as if we were annoying him to take our names down. When we got to the restaurant they placed us at the bar to sit on the high stools. It was our first time here and we did not know that this restaurant had a bar section and a table-and-chair section and when we asked the host if we could get seats at the table-and-chair section, the host seemed annoyed again and said it is too late for us to request that because we were supposed to tell him that when we gave him our name 35 mins ago when we first arrived at the line up. After a long day of work, we had to sit uncomfortably on the high stools to eat dinner. The food was OKAY, it wasn't THAT much better than most other Thai food restaurants, the pad thai I had had a very strong flavour and a lot more sour than pad thai from other restaurants, which could be a good thing or bad thing depending on your own preference. Overall, the experience wasn't amazing and it is pricier than other thai food restaurants."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews of Khao San Road (even though I'm a little late to the party) I decided to give it a shot. Prior to being seated a friend of mine was not sure whether she could make it or not so I asked for a table of 2 instead of 3. After a bit of a wait we were sat by the bar. I figured a small line up indicated exciting things await ahead - WRONG!

My food portions were ridiculously small for the price point. The soup was great but after 2 spoonfuls, I was left wanting more as it was a tiny bowl. The papaya salad was a real disappointment. I did not enjoy my starter at all so I cancelled my main. 

In the mean time my third friend managed to make it to the restaurant. I asked the host if she could join us (there was a single seat next to us at the bar). The lady rudely said no because I had not informed her that there would be 3 people eating and not 2. I replied that I doubt someone would be eating alone as that chair was empty between my group and another couple. Still, she refused and I had no choice but to pay the bill and leave to accommodate my third friend. I was really disappointed by the food, the service and the set up as a whole. 

Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Simply the best Thai in town.  Authentic Thai green curry from scratch and layered flavours"}
{"text":"My go to place for Thai food, and I love their new location even more than the previous one. Great place to eat, catch up with friends, and enjoy the nice music. Their pad Thai is amazing, and they make it in two varieties - Bangkok style with fish sauce and shrimp, and three flavor style for vegans/vegetarians (no fish sauce, no shrimp, can ask for no egg). The portion sizes are great, and with one dish I can have enough pad Thai to share between two people. You've also got to try their Thai iced tea - perfectly smooth and strong (way better than the slushy one at Pai). 

****note: prices have gone up recently. All curry and noodle dinner entrees are now $16.95. Unfortunate that both Khao San and Pai have upped their prices."}
{"text":"The place has the feel of a hip restaurant catered to a younger crowd, with its open garage door style store front and bench style seating. The menu is simple with customizable variations which reminded me of a ramen house. The price seemed steep for Asian food, but comparable to other locations in the neighbourhood. Be warned that this is not a place for a hangout as the lines get long even on a weeknight and the staff will come around to check on progress regularly..."}
{"text":"4/5 - delicious

This place gets busy. Real busy.

And for good reason - it's just flat out delicious. Sometimes there are places that are just reliable. It's not always \"wow my mind is blown\" but it is \"I'm hungry for something that will be delicious.\"

I can't remember the last time I went wrong here. I don't even have a favorite - it's just flat out delicious comfort food."}
{"text":"Thai food lovers rejoice because Khao San Road is finally back! The restaurant is now tucked away at King/Charlotte and has (slightly) more seating than its previous location. There are high ceilings, colourful tiled walls, and bright lighting - all of which make the place a lot more vibrant and welcoming. It's going to get busier and busier as more people find out about its opening (which I believe was only a few weeks ago), but for two of us we managed to get a seat fairly quickly on a Thursday night. I think we might've waited less than 10 minutes.

Ordered the thai iced tea - rich and sweet, it's very similar to the one at Pai. We also got the squash fritters to share - again, similar to the one at Pai and just as tasty! I had the green curry with chicken for my main while my boyfriend got the pad gra prao. Both dishes were good as expected.

Really excited that this has re-opened in the area because it means more Thai food options for me!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times since my first visit in March.  And what I always say is repeat visits means the food isi CONSISTENTLY delicious.

That's special in a city that is overwrought with let-downs.  My latest visit to Khao was as good as the first.  It's still just as busy, but they make the effort to fit you in as soon as they can.  We were told it would be a 15 minute wait so my friend and I went for a walk.  About 20 minutes later we returned to find a table waiting - 'reserved' - that's right, they didn't just give it up to the next group.  Service is a little slow but forgiveable.  And the food, still SO good.  My favourite is still the Gaeng Graree, spicy yellow curry with beef. It's amazing how so few ingredients can generate such big bold flavours.
 
Slow and steady wins the race, flashy and pricey fizzles."}
{"text":"This place has terrific Thai food but it's really busy with a lineup to get in."}
{"text":"had the uber eats lunch, was a yellow curry fried rice. nice flavour but it wasn't the hottest meal..totally not the restos fault. I'm sure if I dined it and had it fresh, it would be super delicious"}
{"text":"Over the years, Thai food has become one of my top faves. I wouldn't say I'm a connoisseur of it but I can be a bit picky when it comes to it. 
I've eaten at Sukho Thai before and wasn't blown away. The food was good but I felt it was over-priced and the wait time was ridiculous. 
I'm not a fan of the way Khao San is set up. You dine elbow-to-elbow with strangers so it feels like you're at a trough. That's what kept me from giving it the five-star treatment. 
My friend and I opted to sit at he front patio even with the threat of rain otherwise, we would have had to wait a long time for a seat at one of the troughs. I was so hungry, I didn't care that I would be devouring my food right in front of other hungry-eyed patrons patiently waiting for a seat.
 I was overwhelmed with all the options on the hip designed menu. So many delightful sounding dishes (and difficult to pronounce) and very vegetarian-friendly. After much deliberation, I settled on the Gaeng Phed - a green curry with butternut squash, bell peppers and basil leaves. 
Holy crap! It was like an explosion in my mouth. So flavourful, rich, spicy and savoury! 
I fell in love immediately. I would've licked the bowl clean if I was in the privacy of my own home.
I'm definitely going to repay a visit to this place. Even though the wait time and layout of the restaurant blows, the food more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 Had the papaya salad for starter - nice and spicy- good balance of flavours. The pad Thai was decent. The waiter was too cautious about the spice for us. I eat spice and the waiter kept saying 'The 6 is too is too spicy'. He pressured us to get a 3. It was good but wanted more spice - maybe the waiters should be less cautious about the spice.  The chilli sauce is spicy though.

The pad Thai was good and had really good ingredients and flavour otherwise. 

Can get crowded."}
{"text":"OK - so...was pumped to try this place for a few reasons...I'm not a huge thai food eater and I heard this place was unreal. I went out with a couple gfs for a birthday. Besides the fact the food was GREAT...the experience as a whole was awful.

1. They made us wait outside until our whole party arrived...3/5 girls were waiting for 10 minutes. Unnecessary.
2. Service is beyond slow. We all ordered wine and beer - they did not come back and ask us if we wanted another drink (on top of this...$12 for a 4oz glass is outrageous, they claim is it 6..absolutely not) - we were parched for a solid 25 minutes. Didn't get refills on water either.Tried to flag our waitress a few times and it was a mission. Finally when we did catch her, it took another 20 minutes to get the bill...
3. It was a HOT in there. Literally, no air. Honestly, I considered going outside for air about 7 times. Meanwhile, you're eating thai food...imagine that situation.

PRO: Food was excellent. Highly suggest the squash fritters. I got the three flavour pad thai which was good too."}
{"text":"Thankfully I didn't have to wait at all. Went with hubby on a weeknight and was luckily seated right away. Great service. We had the crisp fried prawns and that was amazing. For mains my hubby had the massaman and I had the khao soi. Since I have a fantastic family recipe for both these dishes I was quite disappointed by how thick the gravy was. Both these dishes were overpowered by coconut cream where they should have been cooked in a light broth of coconut milk. Sad! My quest for good khao soi continues."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is my favourite Thai place in the city. Whenever I'm downtown for meetings, I try to stop by for lunch. It's a small space and it's very popular so you may have to wait in line (outside) for a bit to get a table (but it's worth it!).

My favourite thing on the menu is the beef pad gra prao. 9/10 this is what I'll get. Their pad thai is also very delcious.

Last time I went a couple weeks ago, we were seated at the bar and had the opportunity to talk to the owner who's a very laid back guy. He was telling us about his new, more adventurous restaurant nearby. I hear it's a bit pricey but if the food is anywhere near as good as KSR I'll definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time, wow! Best pad Thai I've had yet. Service was great as well. Cramped space but I personally don't mind that kind of atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is wholesome and I like the atmosphere. Always a wait to get in though (but worth it, in the not-so-cold months, at least imo).

I am completely ignorant on what constitutes good Thai cuisine, but man, the noodles are well-portioned (not too much), and I like that the sauce is not over-spiced (some places, I find myself reaching for more water than usual, because of the salty, over-spiced meal I had enjoyed haha).

I suggest going with a friend or more and sharing plates, or venture out and experiment with a menu item (have yet to eat a miss meal, but I've gone 3 times so I have not had every dish)."}
{"text":"This place is what my friend described as a \"Hipster\" restaurant. The atmosphere is laid back, decor is modern with a twist of history laid out in framed up photos. Walking in we were greeted and had a short wait of 10 minutes. 

Our waiter was quick to see us and take our orders. We ordered the famous Khao Sai and Pad Thai. When the Khao Sai came, my friend was so in love with the crunchy noodle curls (?) on top of the curry. But when we started eating the dish, man,it was amazing. Indescribable, just delicious!!! The  Pad Thai was good too, but I feel as though Pad Thai is probably easier to do well than curry. The Khao Sai is a must for our next visits and newcomers as well.

The service was quick, however, the space of the place is a bit small. I remember being seated in a corner and it was a bit cramped. But our foods didnt fall off. So I guess thats good. Overall, I think this is a must return/go to destination in the future."}
{"text":"Visited this place a while back with a friend because we've both seen the hype about the restaurant on Yelp. Entering the restaurant I was very impressed by the trendy decor. My friend and I got to the restaurant just before the lunch rush and got seated promptly at the bar. I ordered the lunch curry special and was pleased but not blown away. I think the price point at the restaurant is more reflective of its location and clientele rather than the quality of their food. Perhaps I'm less impressed because I come from Scarborough where I can find similar cuisine at a significantly lower price point. Overall, Khao San Road was only ok. Nothing was done poorly, but nothing amazed me enough to return. At the end of the day I would rather visit somewhere with a lower price point for similar quality of food."}
{"text":"Dearly beloved, as a devotee of Thai food I believe Khao San Road is located at the intersection of There is a God Avenue and Holy Basil Boulevard. 

The Pad gra prao (beef for me) used to be one of my most frequent Thai lunches in Hong Kong - this is the first time I've eaten something as good here - better in fact. With the help of a mouthwatering side of endorphin-rush-making prik nam pla (fiery chilli peppers in fish sauce), my mouth glowed and burned with transcendental bliss, slightly mellowed by kissing a chilled Singha.

I will eventually get around to trying some of my other faves like Tom Yum Kung and gaeng massaman on future visits, but for now, I will simply praise the gods of Thailand and say pass me some more pad gra prao whenever I make my pilgrimage there.

Amen."}
{"text":"Finally tried this popular Thai restaurant. Not disappointed! 
Big portions, I would recommend two appetizers and one main to share for two people.
Garlic tofu. Loved the texture. Crispy skin and chewy inside. 
Squash fritter has an unique taste, highly recommend(big portion too)
Khao soi with beef, very fulfilling. The crispy noodles are delicious with the curry.
Friendly service. Enjoyed their ambiance a lot."}
{"text":"I think the quality deterioration warrants an update. I recall the waits at their old location were so long that sometimes I would put my name down and catch a shorter movie nearby and by the time I was out they would be ready to seat moi. But the waits were the norm then until decent Thai food became a regular thing all over and now they have to meet a minimum new standard. 
The setup is new yet I didn't enjoy the seating on the shared tables. The couples (yes plural) next to us were so close we could hardly talk to each other. The seats aren't comfortable and the service wasn't anything to write home about. 
Now for the bummer only one type of beer! Really I have had my share of Singha beer in Bangkok's beer gardens since imports are so expensive in Siam but here you should have more options IMO. Ah well moving on to the main event the quality has gone down a lot for khao soi as it was a poor reflection of the glory days. Gone is the tender beef which draws me to this dish. The curry is ok and the bowl they serve it in here isn't as conductive to eating. With a larger and much better option nearby I think I will be skipping this spot."}
{"text":"Came here for our first meal in Toronto as yelp showed really good reviews... I had the 3 flavor pad Thai and it was pretty good except that the spice level is actually more than you would expect.. I got medium which say \"average\" but it was actually pretty spicy! Their Thai tea helped calm my burning mouth down tho lol"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Pad Thai I've had in Toronto so far (I recommend the Three Flavours Pad Thai over the Bangkok one, but they are both great). The Pad see ew is also recommended if you're looking for something other than pad Thai. Love the misshaped noodles. I also had a chance to taste the Khao soi and pad gra prao which were tasty but my friends said they preferred the one at Pai. The portions were average and we were quite satisfied. All entrées are $16.95 with an additional charge if you want to substitute beef or shrimp. 

The Thai iced tea is also definitely recommended ($4.95). We had decided to go upstairs in the bar while we waited for our table and had the Thai iced tea there (same price and we were able to bring it downstairs when the table was ready, but had to pay first). At the restaurant, my friend ordered the same drink, and we noticed it was bigger than the one served upstairs for the same price.

Unfortunately they don't take reservations, but we didn't have to wait too long around 8pm on a Friday for 4 people, though we may have gotten lucky. The atmosphere was lovely and the seating was comfortable. I appreciated the decorations as well, though unfortunately I cannot compare it to the old khao San road. 

Although a bit pricey, I would definitely return to get their pad Thai with chicken!"}
{"text":"Not much has changed at Khao San Road. I encourage you to read my previous review below. The food is good but then again you would have to try hard to make bad Thai food so one star for food. With 90 people giving them 2 stars or less I am not alone. With the exception of fast food, part of the experience when dinning out is the service, this place has nailed it! Rude, arrogant and over all bad attitude. Being one to care more about quality of the food I usually care less about service. Here they charge so much service should top notch and it is not.  This is my second time here and I would not go back with so many good alternatives. My new best Pad Thai in the City is Eat Thai Cowell Avenue. A cute place, very friendly and good service and warm smile."}
{"text":"Great Thai food. I arrived on a Saturday morning for lunch at about 11:45. Got a table right away but the place was completely full by noon. Not hard to see why Khoa San Road is so popular -  the food is delicious. 

Just one question - where the heck is the sign? I walked past it a few times expecting to see a sign with \"Khao San Road\".  

I really like the layout. They have everything from tables of two, bar seating, communal tables and a patio in front. The front windows all open up so the restaurant has a real open feel and you get fresh air.

Staff was incredibly friendly and the service fast and efficient. Water and drinks came immediately and refilled quickly. Food was also prepared quickly and fresh.  

We started with the Po Pia Pak Sod Gai Yaw or \"fresh rolls\" - nice light starter packed with flavour. Like a spring roll (not fried though) with chicken sausage, carrots, mint leaves and basil. Great Tamarind garlic dipping sauce. Best spring roll in my opinion.

We shared two main dishes: 

Pad Thai street style at $14 - Everyone knows what this dish is so I will just say it was fantastic - maybe the best I ever tried. We picked the medium spice level but  would probably go with spicy next time. 

Pad Kee Mao at $14 - the real winner for me and my fav. dish of the meal. The base is stir fried rice noodle like the Pad Thai but you get a nice kick from the green chilli's and garlic. Also served with bamboo shoots and egg. Love it!

What a great experience. Another trifecta - great food, fantastic service and cool atmosphere - what more could you ask for? 

I'm already planning my return visit...

BK"}
{"text":"The place is slowly becoming the go to Thai place  for me. I can't honestly count how many times I've been this year. It doesn't help that it's five minutes walking distance from the office and home! My favourite was always the wide noodle dish pad see something. Lately I've learnt why Pad gra prow is all the rage. Definitely a party in your mouth. And them squash fritters are irresistible. Oh yes my friend ordered the green curry fried rice and that was some insane good flavours too.
The other curry dishes like massaman or khao soi just have too much of one flavour and are super heavy. I'd pass on those, except maybe green curry but I find it a bit too oily.
Things I dislike there is the wait time, which seems to have diminished at the new location.. What I really do dislike is the default tip options. Seriously? 18-25%? Nah I need you to hand feed me for that."}
{"text":"its near my condo, so occasionally we came here for dinner.
The first time I have been to this place , and I ordered the thai spicy... Which really BURNED my stomach...."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. GREAT food and GREAT service. The beef Pad Gra Prao and the chicken Pad Thai were totally tasty. Yes, the wait is looooong... but well worth it. Also, I found the medium Pad Thai and the soup of the day to be way hotter than expected. The waitress saw me struggling with the heat and brought over a free milky Thai Iced Tea to help. I love that kind of service. Will go back whenever I can."}
{"text":"Average food, small portions, way too noisy, and quite simply HORRIBLE customer service. Every time. Like a masochist I kept going back. 

Most recently I ordered a small lunch using Ritual. I ordered the cup of soup and roll and selected the \"vegan option\" button. 

Ritual said it would be ready in 25 minutes. I got caught up in work so I arrived after around 40 minutes and it wasn't ready, they hadn't even started it, so I waited.

I took my food back to the office and ate half the roll before I realized that it had chicken in it. First time I've eaten chicken in 20 years, thanks for that Khao San.

I took it back and as completely expected the service was terrible. They blamed Ritual for the mistake!!! They said something about you're not supposed to be able to order that combo without a main. Well, I *was* able to order it, and what exactly does that have to do with it being late and not being vegan as requested? They refused to give me my $ back and told me to contact Ritual. I did contact Ritual and felt silly doing so because it's not their fault but they kindly gave me a $5 credit. 

I have other examples of terrible service there but don't want to waste another minute thinking about the place. I will never go back and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Go to Pai instead."}
{"text":"Signature dishes are amazing!! I had a food orgasm when I ate here. Yummy yummy

So I've gone Back here numerous times. Last time I ordered and dish for take out. When I got home it was the wrong one :( 
But I did contact them and they went out of their way to rectify the problem. Customer service they provided was beyond great. 

The most delicious Thai food in Toronto with the best customer care. What else could u want ???"}
{"text":"I love Thai from my days in Seattle.  This may be the best  I have ever had.  I knew I was in good shape here when it was 2 pm and their was a line out the door.  They have two phad thai's the street and the house with a little extra,.  The house with the extra thai spice and lime is AMAZING !!!!  Each day they have a curry Monday was Green Curry and I love it.    This place is golden."}
{"text":"This is place is super tasty! It was busy so be prepared to wait, if you're solo you should get a bar spot right faster.

A word of warning though, if you don't do spicy go mild. Medium was too hot, this place does traditional Thai spice. The food was excellent but a little different than I remember in Thailand, which doesn't mean it's not good but it was different. I ordered the Massaman curry which was more tamarind than I expected; however, it still tasted great. And just for a throw back I ordered a Singha. There were so many things I wanted to try, it's too bad there wasn't a tasting menu.

I'd definitely go back and try a few more things. There is also a cocktail bar upstairs that looked fantastic."}
{"text":"Generally when it comes to Thai food, I'm led to believe that they all taste the same or similar and they're all pretty good. But Khao San Road is AMAZING, DELICIOUS AND AWESOME. 
The Pad Thai? Yeah seems like an obvious choice at a thai resto and you might convince yourself to try something else because you probably had to wait a while to get seated (and you want something you can't get somewhere else), but OH MY GOD IT'S SO GOOD. This pad thai has kick and flavours like no other. There is a reason why this place is packed all the time (not like grand electric and other overhyped restaurants) 
I love this place, I'd eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"So for their grand re-opening, KSR treated customers to a free entree!  How fab was that???  To my surprise, there wasn't a line snaking around the block!  Instead, names and phone numbers were taken down and I was called after about 2 hours (which was exactly what they estimated the wait time would be).  

3 of us ordered: green curry (came with rice), Bangkok style pad thai, and the pad see eew, all medium spice level.  Everything was well-portioned and freshly prepared.  Tasty food!  All dishes ranged from $15-$20 depending on whether you added chicken, tofu, beef, or shrimp as your protein. I think my only criticism would be that \"medium\" spice was not consistent throughout the three dishes.  The green curry was noticeably spicier than the noodle dishes.  I will definitely order \"spicy\" next time but not \"Thai spicy\" cuz I don't want to cry.  Oh right, there was a lot of ice in my mango juice.  They could probably put a bit less.  

Whoever said there's no such thing as a free lunch didn't know there actually is such a thing as a free dinner!  (Of course we left a good tip as the servers were quite attentive considering it was so busy.)

Welcome back to the neighbourhood!  :)"}
{"text":"Great thai food experience in Toronto. The Green curry chicken will be added on my list of favorite places for this dish! The wait can be long, so either be prepared to arrive early or leave your name and come back."}
{"text":"The best thai food outside of Thailand... I swear! Get there early... The lines can be pretty long."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is probably best known for the beautiful decoration (let's be honest, it is just the tiles). However, I think the food is also delicious, and there is also an excellent bar on the second floor which is very underrated and should be more heavily advertised. 

The only downside to my experience was the fact that I had to wait 1 hour to be seated. The main issue was the person taking reservations didn't seem organized and was using a very messy piece of paper. It's 2017, use a computer and a proper reservation software."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Line up was out the door, so the expectations were quite high. 

The prices were very reasonable ($8 for chicken curry soup and ride) and servings were decent. 

Waitresses were very good and very friendly, except it was very busy and it seemed like they were rushing for is to leave."}
{"text":"I recommend the Pad Thai and Singha beer!!! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. First of all we waited way too long. We were quoted an hour and 15 minutes but waited around 2 hours. I know that is part of the charm for some people but not for me. I ordered the khe sao beef with coconut milk at medium spice level. It was nice and signifigantly hotter than my gfs chef special pad Thai which was also medium. The pad Thai was mild in terms of the peanut taste but also the spicing. All the ingredients did fresh though and it was not overly salty. I'd like to compare it to salad king and some other Thai places to get a better idea but for now this place gets three stars"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto! Squash fritters, Pad Thai and green curry are so good! If you like spicy, they will give you spicy. Super hot! There is always a line up after 6pm any day of the week - usually a 45 mins to an hour wait, but totally worth it."}
{"text":"What they said. I hold back one star because it's always so damn crowded, but maybe the close proximity of the other diners and the crush of people at the door is part of the authenticity and it wouldn't be the same if it was the size of a Swiss Chalet (don't get me wrong; I love Swiss Chalet too!)

So, unbelievably good and worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai place! Service is fast and food is great. The atmosphere is great. The only thing is you probably have to wait for seats, but as you are waiting, you can grab a few drinks at the upstair bar. 

Must get: Squash fritters. Big crunchy bites. 
Thai milk tea is fantastic too. 

Tip: Even medium (avg) level of spice is spicy. Think Asian spice level rating.

Price is average for downtown Toronto. Paid $20 each for us 4 gals."}
{"text":"The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because of the fact that we were waiting outside for a table for an hour, and then when our party of 4 was seated, we had to share the table with 2 others.

That said, the owner (I think) brought us out a bowl of shrimp and squash chips to nibble on while we were waiting which was a nice touch. And the only reason why we had to share a table was because the place was so busy (730 on a Wednesday)

I got the Gaeng Massaman with Shrimp and was blown away. Shrimp were cooked perfectly, as were the potatoes. Hands down one of the best thai meals I've ever had. 

We shared a starter, had 4 mains, 3 beers and a coke and the total bill was just under $100 - for the quality of food, extremely good value.

The vibe of the place is nice. A busy hum and very chatty. The waitress came over quickly with water and shortly after took our orders, and the food came out fast too.

If you're anywhere near this place and are debating where to go for a great meal, definitely give it a try. Maybe call ahead first to see how long of a wait there'll be though."}
{"text":"Every time I have been there the food is just excellent and I never leave disappointed.
Reasonably priced and cheap date night .
You can tell by how busy it always is that a lot of other people know what's up here."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. Took over 30 minutes to get our order (table of 3) and meal was way too spicy for medium, they refused to switch it."}
{"text":"Papaya salad, khao soi, squash fritters, green curry and coconut water. My second time came here. The squash fritters was not as crispy as last time I tried."}
{"text":"The last experience here when we came out was absolutely wonderful. I would give five stars but it is still quite a wait. They did text us when a table was ready For a heads up so we were able to grab a drink nearby which was nice of them. The food we get this time was fab- shout of for the spicey beef and the chicken dish we had it was wonderful flavour and totally yum. and I do appreciAte how they have a legend for how spicy. I love the communal mixed drink bucket so come of your a sharing is caring type of personality. Our server this time was totally over attentive in a great way and checked in frequently to make sure our experience was going well. And last shout out goes to the music playlist here .. All the songs were a nice mix of classics and I swear it was right off my iPod."}
{"text":"The line is long so leave our name early, if they call you for your table you have to answer your phone....they don't answer when you call. 

Small joint overall, plan to share a table with others but food is fantastic. Order anything on the menu, you won't be disappointed. The sauces are delicious and appropriate for all dishes. Spice wise I ordered a 2 and still had a really good kick to it."}
{"text":"My go-to Thai spot in Toronto. 

The turn over is super quick and they'll always have a spot for you in 10 to 15 minutes- which is saying something because the place is always PACKED.

I'm in love with the mango salad (when they have it), coconut shrimp (when they have it) and the khao soi. But everything I've ever had here is fantastic.

You can even get some Thai Red Bull... Just saying."}
{"text":"Finally tried out this new location for lunch. Overall, the quality of food was still high just as it was at the previous location I was more familar with. The only downside really was a long wait at lunchtime and then fairly slow service/wait times for the food once we got seated.

However, despite all of that those wait times were long forgotten once I got to taste the amazing green curry. Absolutely spot on flavors and just the perfect amount of heat (went with Spicy to keep it light for lunch). I will definitely be back just might time things differently for my visit."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food.  Got take out with some friends.  Favourites were the panang curry and squash fritters."}
{"text":"The Pad thai was Very good! 
Be sure to wait outside before open, I suggest 30 minutes before."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but the service was really slow. My friend and I had to step up onto the ledge to get to our seat. The portions were fairly large. If you're not a spicy food kind of person, I wouldn't get mild. Medium was a little more spicy than expected. Overall it was a cute place!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner last night with friend and we ordered the squash fritters, which I've had before, and the Khao Soi with beef, which I tried for the first time on the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers - they did not steer me wrong. 

The squash fritters are a big portion, easily shareable between 3-4 people, and comes with a delicious dipping sauce. The Khao Soi is a noodle dish in a creamy coconut milk broth flavoured with Thai spices and topped with crispy noodles. The beef was very tender and the pieces were quite big. I found the broth to be rich, so I couldn't imagine eating the whole thing on my own but it's perfect if you're sharing. 

It's had a casual ambience but it gets very busy with many people waiting for tables. Larger groups will have difficulty finding a table and may have to wait for a while. The longest I've waited in the past was an hour with a group of 6 people on a Saturday evening. Also, they only seat you once your entire party has arrived and you can't make reservations. 

Definitely recommend this place if you're into Thai food, it's one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"We were told a 25 min wait on a Monday night around 7p but it was really only about 15 min. I love spicy food but their medium (average) was no where near spicy to me. She gave me \"hot sauce\"  on the side which was really just crushed red pepper flakes in oil. I had to use a lot of it to get to the spice level I was looking for. The food was awesome! I had veggie red curry and the soup of the day and both are rave worthy. However next time I would get the spicy or Thai spicy versions. The soup had the perfect balance of spice and flavor. Throughout our visit we noticed a lot of people getting take-out. I think next time if we don't have a  specific reason to eat-in, then we will order food to go. It beats the waiting esp if there's a really long wait."}
{"text":"I heard this was the best Thai in Toronto. I guess my expectations were too high. I was underwhelmed by the pad thai. It was pretty standard to me... go for a curry maybe!?"}
{"text":"Back up to five stars and I forgive them for the rubbery noodle incident. We sat at the bar this time and they had some cool 80's music rockin' The bartender was fabulous and the food, as always was amazing.

Yes, it's busy and it's loud, but a little Yelp research will inform you of this before you go. No one has ever rushed me out the door and i've always had great food and a fab time here! You can read my first review for one that's a little more detailed. but I wanted to make sure I bumped them back to the 5 stars they deserve."}
{"text":"So far, the best thai restaurant I've been to! I went of a weekday for dinner with my friend and this place was packed! As soon as the food came out, I found out why it was so packed! That's not all, compared to many restaurants, this place actually have clean glassware, cutleries etc. I like how they ask you to choose your spice level knowing that many that do come have few to no experience as to how spicy thai food can become! the food is very flavourful and atmosphere is very casual. I will most definitely come back and also suggest it to all my close friends! :)"}
{"text":"We were a group of 8 and it was a Monday night with pouring rain. I knew it would get busy so I came a hour early to make reservations. You cant make reservations over the phone! 

I was told we were only able to go in once our whole group was here. Unfortunately some of us were late so we actually had to push out reservation time to like 40 mins. I felt bad but the lady was really understanding.

Ambience was great- somewhat traditional mixed in with a modern flare! 

I ordered the Green Curry with chicken and this was my first time trying authentic thai curry. The flavour was bold and was incredible. You can taste the freshness and it was just the perfect amount of coconut milk! There was a lot of chicken pieces too! The rice it came with was so flavourful, moist, and soft!

My friend had the Red Curry and it was amazing as well! I would say Red Curry is more a tomato taste while Yellow Curry is sweeter?

A great place to eat some authentic thai food. We were a group of 8 so gratuity was included but we each just had to pay $20. The waiter was so nice filling our water promptly and answering any questions he had for us. I definitely recommend this place!

PS. Vegetarian options available too!"}
{"text":"Walked over there from my office downtown on a Wednesday afternoon around 5 with no reservation. Just barely beat the rush (a line formed immediately after we sat down). 

The food was great -- for appetizers, we had the shrimp chips, with a delicious tamarind dipping sauce, and the chicken sausage spring rolls, which were a perfect balance of crisp with chewy and spicy with sweet. My entree was this delicious yellow curry-chicken-noodle extravaganza whose proper name escapes me -- it was part of their specials menu. The curry was thick and rich with coconut milk, and the chicken and noodles sopped it up deliciously. I downed the remnants from the bowl (and took a hit of the hot sauce they drizzled on top). My father-and-eating-partner had a great beef pad thai (street style, I think) which tasted fantastic from the bite he offered me. 

Service was pretty speedy, although the woman who worked our table seemed weirdly detached and disinterested in us. Not chatty, not obnoxious, just a bit weird. It got the job done, though. Things could be better if there was ice in the water and more seats to be had. I'm just glad we got lucky and enjoyed such a delicious meal without having to wait in line."}
{"text":"Very fine dinning Thai restaurant. Trendy! The food is solid. The taste is cery elegant. Long wait, Small portion, quite expensive but worth it. I would definitely love to be back anytime i am in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Ya... as good as it gets. Awesome food, great atmosphere, good service. Pad thai (and EVERYTHING else..) the way its meant to be."}
{"text":"I can't remember a time when Khao San Road wasn't on my radar, but I'm finally ready for us to go our separate ways.

The menu here is almost identical to the two other establishments founded by the same couple, but falls short on service and atmosphere. The restaurant felt chaotic with frantic energy. I kept being ushered to wait in different areas just to get in line to wait in line. After much confusion, my friend and I finally got seated at the bar, which was uncomfortably crammed. Food here tastes great, of course, but as do the dishes at Pai / Sukho Thai.

It breaks my heart to say this: Khao San Road, you've been good to me, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best Pad Thai I have ever had in my life. It was delicious!!!! The restaurant is small and seems to always be busy so be patient. You'll be glad you waited."}
{"text":"Came around 5:30 with 4 and waited about a half hour so keep that in mind. We weren't in a rush so we were happy to hang and chat. Service was fast and attentive but hard to hear. It's a very cosy place with loud music which is fun but can making hearing hard. Squash fritters are amazing definitely try those. We ordered green curry, three flavour pad thai, khao soi and green curry fried rice. Everything was very flavourful. My highlight was the khao soi. Beware that spicy is still very spicy even though it appears to be the lesser of the spice levels. I like spicy a lot but just \"spicy\" was causing me problems and left my stomach feeling upset. All in all great spot. Food and ambiance are great but not the greatest neighbourhood in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place makes me wish I lived in Toronto.

There are oodles of raving reviews about the awesomeness of this place so I'll keep this short. It's true what they say, the lineups are insanely long all throughout the evening. You either come early (I think we came around 530) or be prepared to wait - but you'll be glad you did.

Pad Thai - perfect!
Thai Iced Tea - amazing!
I don't remember which curry I had but I remember it being delicious!

I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but I was pleasantly surprised to see their extensive vegan menu!

Overall, best Thai food I have ever had!

* you can leave your phone number with them when you give your name and they'll call you when it's your turn!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend went there around 6pm. It was already so packed. We waited for 20 mins until we got a table. Food was nice. I had pad gra prao with a \" level 3 spicy\" spicy level and it was super spicy. It was the top three hot food I've ever had in Canada. My friend is a Chinese who loves spicy food. She got a \"level 6 Thai spicy\" and it was extremely super dying hot. We couldn't feel anything other than burning on the tongues. We had to order another dish in order to get rid of the burning. It turns out to be pretty good and we both like it! Just remember not to underestimate their spicy levels when ordering food!"}
{"text":"I wish I could review the food but I didn't even get that far. First the girl, who is apparently Managing tonight, told us there was an hour minimum wait so we left out number and left. Then 10 minutes later she calls to say the table is ready so we go back. 2 of 4 were dropped off in front and the other 2 went to park the car. She told us we couldn't be seated until all 4 were here, when I told her they were just parking the car she was like \"ok I told you I would give you 5-10 minutes including parking I turned the people who were before you away because their whole party wasn't that's why I called you in the first place\" and walked off. OK. So we wait and as one of the other 2 came he spoke to her to tell her hey he's literally right there and she said \"I gave your table away already I told them you had 10 minutes\". She was very snooty about it so he was like \"can I just speak to you on the side\" and she said no. So he stepped aside and said \"this is bullshit\", he was stepped to the side not in front of the crowd, at which point she was like \"you're off the list and if you ever try to come back here...\" so I stopped her right there and pulled him aside and let her know that we wouldn't want to thanks so much and left.

She was very stressed and not personable. I'm big on service so thanks but no thanks I won't be going back. I'm sure the food is amazing but if there is an on duty manager, they should be able to manage situations."}
{"text":"Could it be?  I'm the 100th review for the always fabulous Koh San Road?!

Let me tell you how much I love this place - from the kick ass Pad Thai, to the amazing Khao Soi, to the crispy and tasty squash fritters, and the coconut dessert, and the milkshakey thing.  Oh man.  I have NEVER had a bad meal here.

I generally don't write reviews for places that already have so many, but my first taste of the Gaeng Massaman this week blew my mind.  
I'm always hesitant to try new things when you know the other things you get area always amazing.  New things are risky, you know?!  
But Koh San Road did not disappoint: The Gaeng Massaman curry dish with shimp made my head explode with awesomeness.  Rich, coconutty, peanutty, sweet and tangy.  My word. It was quite near orgasmic.

So yeah, go here. Lots."}
{"text":"I can see why this place gets so many good reviews.

Have been here a few times.
Food is wonderful and different and a nice change from the usual Thai offerings.

Well worth a visit, be prepared it may be busy and deservedly so!"}
{"text":"Very cute family style seating with long tables. Servers are very friendly, but they don't speak english well. Substitutions for certain ingredients are accepted. Much cleaner than the regular Thai restaurants you find in other areas of the city. Food is delicious!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Loved the milk tea. The curry is pretty good and authentic. Line up is always nasty though. Budget enough time"}
{"text":"Every dish is so flavorful.  It awakens our taste buds every time we eat there, reminding us how good authentic food really is.  Every bite is heavenly."}
{"text":"Went last Friday night in a group of 4. We arrived around 8:30 pm, and were told seats at the bar would be a 45 minute wait, and a table would be an hour. It definitely took about an hour and a half for the table. I would suggest coming early or right before closing, which is actually when they stop seating people.

We started with the garlic chicken appetizer and the fresh rolls. The chicken, probably the best dish we had all night, was nicely seasoned and perfectly fried with a nice, light crunch. It came with a great sweet and sour chili dipping sauce as well. The rolls were not as good. A bit bland in my opinion. The chicken sausage in the rolls seemed a bit like \"mystery meat.\"

The Thai iced tea, although very creamy, was way too sweet. The balancing bitterness of the tea just wasn't there. To be noted though, I enjoy a strong cup of tea.

I also had the pad thai with chicken. A solid dish, but not amazing. I ordered it medium spicy, but it was pretty mild. I sampled my friends green and yellow curries, both were pretty good as well, but nothing to phone home about. 

Overall, a good choice for Thai food, but not exceptional. I was actually a bit disappointed after reading all the amazing reviews and waiting over an hour for a table."}
{"text":"I work right next to this place - (very dangerous for sure) and usually get the chicken panang curry because it's just so good. A lot of these dishes are pretty heavy (and spicy) so be careful. This place is always busy during lunch and dinner so calling in ahead for take out helps."}
{"text":"THE BEST THAI restaurant ever!! expect a long wait though if you are going for dinner/weekends, they don't take reservations"}
{"text":"My favourite Thai spot in the city. The Khao Soi and Squash fritters are fantastic. Worth the wait in line."}
{"text":"I almost fainted from hunger waiting for my lunch @ Khao San Road today...that was how incredibly Slow their service is. 

I went in with high hopes since it's been the top restaurant on Yelp's Hot List in Toronto for a few weeks now. 
The decor is modern and cute and the restaurant was maybe half full on a Saturday around 1.20p. 

After i was handed a menu (3 pieces of paper stapled together), i waited and waited...and manage to catch someone's eye to order a drink. He politely told me that he'd send someone to take my food order. 

3 very hip and young servers were standing around chatting...and after a long time of awkwardly trying to get their attention, i managed to ask them if someone could take my order...at which time, the female server reluctantly said \"ummm, ya, ok...\". Like i committed an offence by speaking up. 

I then proceeded to wait...get this now...45 mins for my ONE dish of Pad Kee Mao to arrive. 
I counted 9 people in the kitchen (not all cooks, i'm sure...but still) and 4 servers out front. 
With 13 people in the restaurant...and about as many dining there (srsly, there were maybe 20 people. definitely no more)...does it really take 45 mins at off-peak lunch period to get me a plate of good-but-not-45mins-good Fried Noodles?!

I noticed that every table had the same issues of waiting...and waiting...and waiting...they would bring a plate of noodles to a couple (who were not sharing the dish) and the other person would literally have to wait 15 mins until her green curry arrived.  By which time, her companion had already finished his meal. 

I get that Thai food is generally served family style...but not in US/Canada. And surely they should know this by now?

And i was actually able to time when people got their dishes because, frankly, there was nothing else to do besides trying to keep myself from falling off the chair from hunger pangs. 

The Pad Kee Mao was decent; not clumpy like most fried noodles you get at a Thai restaurant. My Thai Ice Tea was good and the server was nice enough to give me more ice since i didn't like it too sweet...but i really hope they step it up in terms of logistics and service. I really wanted to give it a 4-5* but 45 mins for 1 dish of fried noodles...really turned me off."}
{"text":"i heard tons of great feedback from this thai resturant so we decided to try as a group.

The selection of the food was actually very different from other thai resturants and the flavour were good and sepcial. I guess thats why it is popular.

However, they dont take reservation and you must lineup for at least 15mins - an hour to get seated after 6pm. 

i dont think the food is awsome enough for the wait."}
{"text":"Best pad thai I've had in Toronto. Curry dishes and Thai iced tea are delicious as well. 

The wait can be disorganized and a bit frustrating, but somehow this hasn't tainted my perception of the resto. I think this place is popular for a reason and so I am willing to wait as long as I have good company and we're not in a rush."}
{"text":"Incredible, authentic Thai food.  Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Finally! The real deal! 

First off, Lauren M's KSR review is bang on and covers quite a bit, so read her's first and then check the rest to fill in other details. 

As for my review, now I can send all the Salad King lovers somewhere downtown that actually tastes like Thai should! Fresh, potent and like a good comfort food from a far away land. Delicious! 

I grabbed the Khao Soi ($10) and upped to the combo for another $3 receiving a super fresh spring roll and a wee bowl of some killer Tom Yum soup. Just enough spice to warm my ears and tons of flavor to satisfy my belly. 

The Khao Soi was absolutely delish, though I think it should have a little more heat to it naturally. Fortunately, a request for some heat was met with a small bowl of KSR's home made chili oil and that added the right hook I was looking for. 

And thanks to Lauren M's review - the first one you should read here - I washed it all down with a Thai iced tea. It's large, it's sweet and it's ice cold, just like it should be. 

In addition to incredible food, the service was incredibly friendly and very humbled by our compliments (again, authentic). Even if the food wasn't this good, I'd actually return simply because the owners are that nice and concerned about the experience. 

It's a cool little spot that I'm going to miss getting into so easily when it inevitably becomes ultra popular."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE this place.  for sure the best thai you can get in the city.  I've never been to thailand but one of my friends have and he said that its very authentic tasting.  I've been here a bunch of times and every single time you will have to wait to be seated, but it is so worth it!

Apps - shrimp chips and fresh rolls are whatever, nothing spectacular. The squash fritters are fun and you get a big portion of it, but theres a strong ginger taste in it, so if u're not a fan, stay away.

Mains - the pad thai (street style) is the BEST pad thai u will eat in toronto guaranteed.  It makes all the other pad thais u've tried elsewhere seem like childsplay in comparison. huge portion too.  I refuse to eat pad thai anywhere else now and will only order this as my main everytime I come here.  I do have to say that if you get the veggie option, the broccoli in it is a bit on the salty side due to sauce overload
- the yellow curry is really good. not too spicy at all, lots of coconut flavour, love the potatoes in it

point is if you come here, the pad thai is a MUST try!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food and great service, but so hip it hurts. Or maybe it's just too popular? Always a wait, always crowded and noisy, but I keep coming back because the food is so yummy."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!! We just ordered take out and it was delicious (+was very well packed)...cannot imagine what its like to dine in :)

We ordered the yelp highlighted classics: Khao soi (wow!), pad Thai and pad grao (spelling?).

Love it and will be back many times...one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Overall experience and worthiness: 2/5

Food: Great. 4/5
Appertizer i would recommend the papaya salad even though it's made from fish sauce and is a little bit stinkier than I would like. It taste great but not worth the money. The squash fritter is definitely a must try if you have never tried it. The pad gra pao, you can make it yourself at home within 30 minutes. Yet they charge you $16 dollars for the dish. I admit that it is pretty good but come on. If you have to get a noodle, the three flavour pad thai is really good but make sure you skip the spicy if you can't handle the heat! I would personally skip the massaman curry because it is way too sweet. Go ahead and get the green curry instead, but like pai and sabai sabai, it is the same. 

Make sure to get their dessert if you can spend the money. I personally think that many of these dishes can be made at home and altered to your taste. But if you don't have time and willing to spend $$ then this is the place to go. Altering ANYTHING, I REPEAT, ANYTHING will cost +3.50$ EVEN SPICIER will cost $.50/dish!

Restaurant: 1/5
The place has terrible service where the waitress doesn't even really care about what you think of the food/restaurant. They cramp people into the tiniest restaurant without any space to move around and enjoy yourself. Beware of busier time because you will need to sit REAL close to other people."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in town, no contest, possibly even world class...

All at a very decent price.  Their Pad Thai and Curry are absolutely top notch.

The place is very hip and trendy, so always expect it to be packed and busy during dinner time.  Usually always at least a 15-20 min wait on weekday nights."}
{"text":"This place has good food but it's way over priced and portion sizes are too small for what you are paying for

If I was a millionaire I'd order two of everything and be happy but I don't find its worth the price"}
{"text":"this place is as good as it gets for thai food. i live in a thai restaurant area with mengrai and golden thai but i still travel to this place because of the ambience, quality and service. the wait is worth it. the service is impeccable, the guy always asks me how everything was, my glass is always filled, parking is a bit of a problem but its in the dt core so easily walkable, go on a weeknight and you won't wait long"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Great variety of dishes on the menu and good service. There is likely going to be a wait so plan for at least a 20 minute wait.

We got two of their most popular dishes.
-Pad gra prao with beef: thinking it as well seasoned pan fried ground beef. Generous portion and lots of flavor in the beef. They add a fried egg which I don't think is needed but who doesn't like a runny yolk?!

-khai Soi: think of it as a very flavorful and hearty curry broth with noodles and your choice protein. I got it with chicken and it was the absolute perfect dish to have on a cold Fall day."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend on Tuesday, and I was surprised at how packed it got quickly. The place is small so make sure to make a reservation for regular table. If you go earlier before the dinner rush then you get seating at the non reserved area. Otherwise you'll be waiting in line.

We also tried the squash fritter which was awesome. Definitely a great appetizer. Fried squash  - need I say more...yum.

We tried the Pad Thai which was good, but a bit too sweet for me. If you like spicy food get spicy chili level. Medium wasn't spicy at all. 

All the reviews are true Kha Soi is delicious. Noodles in a rich and creamy coconut sauce, and the soft braised beef has a lot of flavor. The crunchy noodles added a nice texture to the dish.

I can't wait to go back and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Their trademark noodle soup is very flavourful though loaded with coconut milk. It is hard to mess up the taste when you are generous with the use of any fat- butter, cream, coconut milk... :)"}
{"text":"At the risk of sounding crotchety, I miss the old Khao San Road.  The original location was small, cramped, lacking in AC sometimes but it was delicious, homey and the whole experience was commiserate with Toronto as a collage of different cultures.  The new Khao San Road feels like a hipster, second generation product with a surprisingly high price point and small portions that leave you wondering if the experience was actually worth it.  

The food is still good, but the spice level was lacking, or at least not as advertised according to their guide.  The meals also used to dominate a plate, now it is kind of a 80% sort of thing. 

The bench seating left no where to escape to when the person sat down next to you has horrific body odor.  

I don't think I'll return, which is quite a shame.  At $17 a meal for mains that aren't quite enough to satisfy the appetite of a 100 lb girl, the value just isn't there."}
{"text":"Khoa San Road is probably the best Thai food that I have ever had in Toronto.

I came by at about 7pm on a Monday night with my friend. The weather was lovely outside, so it was pretty busy. We waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2, which I was told, was not bad at all. The hostess almost forgot that we were there before another table that was waiting to be seated, so while she almost seated them before us, we proceeded to grill her with our eyes and she got the message. She seemed a bit frazzled, but I don't blame her for having such a long line-up out the door. Just be a little more organized next time (this was my only problem with the place, was the hostess' lack of organization at the front, but other than that, my experience was amazing!). 

We were seated at one of the communal tables, which didn't bother me much, but the spaces are quite tight in between, so get acquainted with your neighbor!

We were greeted by a very friendly waitress and we decided to order the garlic tofu to start, then the gaeng massaman and chef's special pad thai to share. Some of my highlights:
-Garlic tofu: super yummy and came with a great dipping sauce on the side. The tofu was medium firm and seasoned quite well. The panko bread crumbs added a great touch to them
-Gaeng Massaman: I'm not a huge curry fan (especially when there's coconut milk), but this curry was awesome. Super thick and rich with slight hints of tanginess. I'm a huge carb-lover so the potatoes were also a great touch
-Chef's Special Pad Thai: I love pad thai, but I love this chef special even more! You definitely taste the sweet, sour, and savory flavors all at once. There's also tiny tofu bits in there which add some more texture. 
Everything was super flavorful and presented well. 

I was very happy with the service here. Everything was delivered to our table quickly and the waitress made sure to come by and check up on us and see if we were enjoying the food. Very friendly staff, very good crowd, just a great time overall."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is one of the best Thai restaurants in the city.

Their Khao Soi and Thai Iced Tea combo is to die for."}
{"text":"Squash fritters - great starter! Tastes quite like onion bhaji. Demolished those in seconds, obviously. Would be nice with a chilli dipping sauce along with the sweet & sour sauce. (They did bring us chilli oil when asked) 

Green curry was excellent - we ordered 2, with different spice levels which were done perfectly. A little watery but not a big deal.

Pad gra pao (shrimp) was cooked & seasoned well, with a small amount of delicious sauce underneath in the bed of rice. I wish there was more! It tasted almost Indian - flavourful, with a '#3' on the spice scale. 

Pad see ew - good, standard type of dish. 

Service was great, very friendly & correct level of attentiveness. The only gripe is more restaurant space needed; it's mostly suited for couples but I guess that's downtown rent for you. 

Loved it as usual and will be back again!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat in Toronto! The vibe is cool and the food is amazing. I've tried a variety of plates and have never been disappointed. I would be careful with the spice levels on some of the dishes as it contains fair amount of spice already (and I can take the heat!) Otherwise, you can't go wrong here and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner before a movie. Good service. They sat us as soon as both of us had arrived and asked for our drink order. I ordered a green curry. The curry was pretty good and the fried rice my friend ordered was pretty large portioned. Would come here again."}
{"text":"After almost a year since they closed their doors at their Adelaide location, Khao San Road is back, and quite close to their former location. They've still got that atmosphere and the familiar menu.

Dishes come out relatively quick and in decent portions.
Ordered the Bangkok-style Pad Thai (mild) and the Khao Soi (mild) and both had a lot of flavour to offer.

Good to see that they're back in the area again."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is alright but is it really the best in Toronto, no. It is not. Don't get me wrong, I will go back and I will like it and it is definitely one of the best in Toronto.   

I do like the subtle modern decor and the owner is really friendly and seems like a nice guy AND a nice laidback place to take a someone on say, a date.

Okay, fine, fine, the place is good.... I was going to recommend it anyway!

I enjoyed their pai thai which is generally the way I judge my Thai places. I mean it is such a basic dish in Thai culture that if you mess that one up, then you are doomed. 
But it was well made here. 

I recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, no question there.
But, getting a seat around lunchtime on weekdays, or evenings is nearly impossible. Perhaps you're thinking, I'll just order take out so I don't need a seat. Good luck even getting someone to answer the phone. So it doesn't matter how good the food is if you can't get it.
It's a shame, because the food is good, but when asked if I want to go to KSR, I'll always choose another restaurant, as KSR isn't the only good Thai restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Tried the renovated location a few times and every time there's something a miss - I think its time we parted ways.  

The quality has definitely declined (while the competition keeps upping their game) .  The beef for the khao soi is no longer cubes of succulent braised beef but thinly sliced beef (usually used for stir fry) that gets rubbery in the khao soi gravy. The quality of the gravy is also not as good as before 

Restaurants either need to perfect their menu or evolve it - Khao San seems to have frozen their original menu but consistently decreased the quality ."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've found in Toronto so far! If you end up having to wait in line, it's totally worth it. The food is fantastic and the environment is really fun and casual. It's nice to be at communal tables and you will literally want to go around the whole restaurant and have a bite of everyone's food :P Beware of the spiciness though! I wished I had toned it down a notch ahah."}
{"text":"Tried Khao San Road on a busy Friday night, ordered the shrimp chips as a starter and a Bangkok style pad thai. Really enjoyed eating here  definitely will come back again, however the hostess was rude and impatient with customers"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Green curry pork with Jasmine rice.

Quality food here.

Vibe: happening!

Parking: taxi is best.

Customer service: fine.

Bathrooms: clean."}
{"text":"There was a huge crowd waiting on the sidewalk for tables so my friend and I put our names down and went for a drink on the patio across the street, returning 40 minutes later. We both ordered from the vegan menu and I liked that the spice level was highly customizable. The vegan pad thai with tofu was delicious (I found myself at work the next day looking forward to eating the leftovers in my fridge at home), perfect with a Singha beer or two. Service was efficient and the place was busy but not chaotic."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place so a group of friends and I went to check it out for lunch.  The place was packed - always a good sign.

We had great, friendly service that popped by our table often to see if we needed anything.  They constantly refilled our water which was nice.

Garlic chicken appetizer was plentiful and definitely full of garlic.  I had the pad see ew, which was a nice portion and tasty.  Friends dishes looked equally yummy and no one complained about their food.

While I don't think I would go out of my way to eat here, I was certainly satisfied and would eat here again if I was in the area and craving Thai."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. This place has gone really downhill. Pad Thai was wet/too saucy and the noodles were a broken up mess.
Had Sukho thai and Pai within the same week and KSR paled in comparison. Sad that this place has gone down so much."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Often a long wait though, and a tight seating arrangement.  Otherwise, great food and they play hiphop as well."}
{"text":"Great Thai food place. Location is a bit out of the way and you have to know this place is there. But apparently lots of people k ow about it: their policy is to only sit people when the full party shows up vs giving a whole table to one waiting person. Great policy considering how crazy popular it is. 
The food is great and the prices are surprisingly not that high.
The veg selection is great and I had hard time deciding what I want to order from the list of offered variety.
Make sure to come early for lunch or dinner as it gets packed."}
{"text":"I went here about a week ago. Not sure if they're still working out some kinks since they just re-opened about a month and a half ago but I found their food kind of disappointing. Both my friend and I ordered curries, hers green and mine red. Both of our curries looked nice but they were so watery, it was more like a thin soup. It seemed like it needed to be reduced down more because the flavour wasn't as rich as I anticipated (I've been to their old location several times). I peeked over at my neighbor's dishes and their curries were also thin as well, so it appeared it wasn't just an inconsistency with ours but how they were choosing to serve them in general. Plus, I was expecting maybe a few new additions to their menu since it re-opened, but it's just the same as before. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing since that's what made them popular but I was hoping for more. 

The decor of this location is a bit plain although, they did have some fun colourful tiles on a few of their accent walls. For some reason, this new location has more of a fast food vibe and doesn't have the same fun and nosy feel as its old location. Possibly due to how it's no longer as cozy and most of the walls are glass looking out on to the street. Also majority of the seating are communal bar tables with place settings that are quite close to each other. The service was fairly good, my water glass was constantly filled even though the restaurant was very busy. 

All in all, the food was pretty meh and I think next time I'd rather just walk a few blocks over to Pai, which still reigns as my favourite. Although, I would be open to returning to KSR to try their Pad Thai and see if that's still as good as it was before."}
{"text":"The reviews that I had read about this restaurant on Yelp was 100% accurate!

We had to wait up to an hour for a table as they don't take reservations. But there's not much room to wait or sit down while you wait. There is a a few benches outside the store but I did not want to sit outside in the cold. As everyone stand in the small entrance, it gets really crowded.

I went on a Saturday evening, so it was probably one of the busiest nights.

The food is amazing and definitely the best thai food I ever had! It hits all the different taste buds. But make sure you dont go too wild when choosing the level of spice. As they say on the menu its better to go with the lower level as you can always add more, but you can't do vice versa! I only tried the egg noodles with the shrimp and it was really good. It was sweet, salty, and extremely spicy (i went a little overboard with the spice).

The seats we got were a little on the uncomfortable side as it was stools we had to sit on. You are lucky if you get the side with the chairs!

*the female washroom stalls are extremely small at this restaurant. It actually made me wonder if i had gained weight after that meal"}
{"text":"Packed in, busy. Average to not so polite service. Not sure why people go here so much. Food was okay, not good enough for me to finish its greasy mess. Shrimp chips were terrible. Supermarket fry at home has more flavour and texture."}
{"text":"The good: Great Thai food, the Khao Soi is a must try.
The bad: No reservations and it can be a long wait if you get there between 7-7:30. Come early or come late.

Definitely one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto, Khao San Road is packed most nights and you'll find yourself waiting 15+ minutes for a table if you get there past 7. They don't take reservations so come early or come late, just try not to come at the peak hours.

A heavy dish, the Khao Soi is a egg noodle dish with a creamy, coconut curry base that comes with Chicken ($13) or beef ($14) and topped with crispy noodles - and d@mn it's good. You can get it with no spice, mild, spicy and Thai spicy. I had the spicy version, which really isn't that spicy and it was great - the curry was well balanced and flavourful (and probably calorie packed) while the noodles were well cooked and the crispy noodles give it a nice contrast of texture. 

Others told me the fritter appetizer (fried something or other) is really good too, but that will have to wait until next time.

Beers are $6."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is by far the best Thai food in toronto if not canada, it rivals any of the best restaurants we have been to in Thailand. 

You cannot go wrong with any of the entrees on the menu. 

Five stars is not enough for this place!"}
{"text":"Food is good but they have worst server. I went there last winter. When I asked for table for two and they said I need to wait out side. Weather was freezing cold with iced rain. And there were not many people waiting. But they asked me to WAITED OUTSIDE. I will never go again."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that is really making an effort - high standards, staff is on point, and the food is above average. I felt the food and service was exceptional, I'd make a point of returning. The only minus I found was the music they played, and didn't love the layout. Overall, I thought this was a gem, worth making an effort to go to."}
{"text":"You MUST try their Pad Gra Prao Beef with fried egg. It is AMAZING! The place is very cramped with limited seating. I think it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't agree with the hype.
I've now been to Pai, Sabai Sabai, and Sukhothai and I can just say that Khao San Road fits right in with the norm. The food is definitely good, there's no denying that - but is it above and beyond delicious? Not really. Also, at $17 per dish when they give a smaller portion size relative to the other downtown Thai restaurants, is it WORTH lining up for? I'd say probably not.

Granted, I always order \"Khao Soi\" whenever I go to a Thai restaurant so that's where I base my comparisons off of. I think if I had to pick, I'd go with Pai as my reigning favourite because they give tender braised beef with their khao soi at no additional fee. Khao San Road gives tofu or chicken as their default and charges you extra if you want to change it to beef. I ordered mine with chicken and it was just okay - not as tender as I'd hoped it would be. 

Overall, I was satisfied with the flavour of the dish but just not the portion size. I could've definitely eaten a little more food, even if it were simply just more plain noodles."}
{"text":"Pad thai always on point. 

If you can grab a seat here, your good to go. 
I like the kind of communal eating thing - it is cool and if you are friendly, it works.

Great good here."}
{"text":"It was a long wait and I can feel the customers frustration at the door as we came in. We didn't know whether to walk up and put our names on a list or if the line up was an actual line. The staff were dressed in normal casual clothes so we had no idea who worked there and who to ask for a table. I asked a random guy and luckily it ended up being the greeter, and there is a list. They should have someone stay at front of house at all times instead of wandering off. Or have some type of system to make the patrons feel that everything is under control and in order.

Other than the whole ordeal in the beginning, the service was decent and the food was just okay. Close to authentic but still mediocre at best. I had the chicken gaeng massaman and the wife had the chef's special pad thai, both medium spice. They really catered to people who can't take the heat so if you want some spicy hotness in your dish, ask for it spicy. The medium we had was more like mild. The pad thai was decent but over powered by cilantro. The massaman was too sweet and the potatoes were not cooked all the way through, there were some crunchy bits.

I would probably won't come back here because of the negative atmosphere, chaos, mediocre food and the feeling of cramped space. The service is good but not worth the food. The one thing I know is that you can't get better Thai food in downtown Toronto other than this place. Please let me know if you anyone out there knows of one?!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. I like spicy food, and found the medium (the \"two\") of the green curry fried rice special perfect: hot but no real burn. Daughter also loved her Pad See Ew with no spice. Supposedly not that busy on Sunday nights, but waited 45 minutes for a table for two, which ended up being on the corner of the bar. Really loud, so if you are looking for a quiet dinner spot, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"First of all: The newly relocated KSR has a very odd configuration to me. Its layout is an awkward, backwards L-shape that feels as if there are two dissimilar restaurants in a shared space. As another reviewer mentioned, it is incredibly loud inside with thumping music and the accompanying din of people trying to converse over it. 

I did not fully enjoy my meal because I found the overall ambiance very off-putting and left earlier than anticipated. Since I was seated at a tall table with a backless barstool, I had to put my coat and purse onto the floor as there was no other logical place for them. Considering that we have coat-weather for over half the year, this is a mind-boggling oversight.

TL;DR: Food is good as usual, but I would rather go to Pai a few blocks over for a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came in the restaurant at 9:11pm & waited for at least 5 mins before a hostess came to ask for how many. She told us to give her a minute to seat us as she walked off.. We waited for her to come back and then said oh theres bad news theres probably no seat for you since its closing soon & theres people on the list till 10pm in a rude attitude. Its fine if the business is full till closing but her bad attitude was the problem. No sense of any customer service. With that type of service and attitude we would not come back regardless if there were seats."}
{"text":"Definitely the Best pad thai in Toronto...if you can handle the long wait at this constantly packed restaurant. This is close to work for me and is often my go to for take out. I've eaten there a few times, but can't describe the vibe other than busy and noisy. Great spot for: quick lunch/dinner after work or loud party with friends. Bad spot for romantic dates and private conversations."}
{"text":"I had one of the best meals I have ever had at Khao San Road last week. I stumbled across it when researching possible places to eat whilst in Toronto on vacation. My husband and I arrived about 5pm on a Friday. We were seated right away, but the restaurant soon filled up. 

The restaurant is beautiful, with lovely colourful tiles and huge windows. The tables are quite small and are close together. 

The service was pretty good. It was obvious that our server was new and was training, but he was very nice and efficient. 

The food was unbelievable. We split the fresh rolls to start, and they were fantastic. The house-made chicken sausage is very tasty, and the vegetables and herbs inside were fresh and crisp. The tamarind dipping sauce was the perfect complement. 

For mains, my husband had the pad gra pow with chicken, which came topped with a crispy fried egg. It tasted wonderful and was cooked very well. 

I had the special of the day, which was a red curry with pineapple. It was utterly delicious - rich, complex and flavourful. I went with medium spice level, which was the right choice as it had a hint of heat but didn't prevent me from enjoying all of the other flavours. The sweetness and tang of the pineapple went so well with the richness of the curry sauce. 

I would highly recommend Khao San Road."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for work and meet up with some friends here. Of course this is a small yet trendy place in Toronto. I believe we had an hour wait during a weekday - which is a bit obsessive. The queue was confusing as I'm pretty sure some people came in after me got to put their names ahead of me in line. 

The highlight of the meal were the squash fritters - they were so good. I've never had anything like that. They were crispy but not greasy and seasoned well. 

Other than that the pad thai and curry were solid. I've been to too many places where pad thai is some weird orange colors and the pad thai is too sweet. I found this place just right."}
{"text":"Came for a bite to eat with colleagues after an all day meeting.

Had the veggie tofu Bangkok pad Thai and spilt the shrimp app.  Service was friendly and quick and the food came our pretty quickly.  Two days before I had a pretty salty sub par pad Thai in Oakville. This one was quite tasty and only disappointment is that veggie apparently meant lots of broccoli and that's about all...  The shrimp app were these light crispy perfectly cooked shrimp bites that I could easily eat far more than the six myself never mind sharing!!

Ambiance?  Clean open layout but somehow also felt a bit cramped.  The open glass concept makes it feel open but the wooden stools at the shared wooden tables were uncomfortable as heck.  Makes you want to eat and run  before your butt or back gets too sore.  Also acoustically quite noisy and had to shout to hear each other.

It's TO after all and I would try other items on the menu next time.  It was busy on a Monday night so that tells you something too...."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here. They have specials of the day and Thursday was panang curry. It had the right amount of spice and the perfect balance of flavours. I also liked that it came with enough rice to soak in the sauces. I also had a side of the tom yum soup which was reminiscent of the one at Pai, which were served with fresh rolls. The fresh rolls were a miss for me, but that won't stop me from coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Yum!  My fav is the 'chickeney bits' appetizer, warning addictive and full of garlic, but of course the pad Thai and beef curry are also delicious"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I have ever had!  I have been here a handful of times and the food here never disappoints.  Last time I went here, I got the Chef's Pad Thai (overflowing with lots of flavours), red curries and green curries, the squash fritters appetizer and the thailand iced tea (very rich, could have been a meal on its own).

It is always busy here, and rightfully so.  The food and service is top notch and the venue is small, but has character.  I love the way the menu looks as it looks something you would see in a restaurant in Thailand.  

Its a must in Toronto!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hilton Garden Inn caddy-corner from this place and the front desk clerk called it \"the best Thai in Toronto\".  It's not that it was bad, but I've had better Thai in other cities (including Thailand LOL).  I am giving it four Yelps because of the overall experience.

The one thing that our recommender didn't mention is that the wait for a table can be VERY long.   We walked up about 7pm on a Sunday in January and were told by the hostess that it would be a 10 minute wait.  It was more like 15 minutes and it seemed longer because of the cold.  One other thing she did not mention is that you can call ahead for a reservation (I think).  Never-the-less, this place was doing a BOOMING business for a Sunday night in January.  All of the tables were packed and nearly as many people were in-n-out for take out.  It is not a big place (maybe seating for 50) and if you don't like feeling a bit claustrophobic, this place might not be for you.  You will be seated right next to other patrons - and they likely are not in your group.

Service was good - not great because of how busy the place is.  It took quite a while to place for the server to come around to place the order.  He apologized.  

The menu is pretty short. We started with fried tofu and had pad thai chicken and khao soi beef for entrees.  This was more than enough food for two guys and we actually left some of it because we were too full.  All were very good.

Judging by the dust on the wine bottles, I don't know if many people order wine here.  The most popular drink is thai chai tea.  We had Singa beers - the only beer on the menu.

The last thing I shall mention in this review is the most memorable part for me: the music they were playing was a hit-list of 80's and 90's rap - everything from \"Humpty Dance\" to \"Me So Horny (explicit) to \"Gin N Juice\".  Considering how packed the place was and the noise level of the patrons, this music was LOUD and funny.  I don't know who picked the music, but it was one of the strangest playlists I have ever eaten to."}
{"text":"This would be my favourite thai place in the city. The garlic shrimp, rice paper rolls, and of course, pad thai, are all amazing. Yes, the line up is totally worth it. I love the atmosphere too."}
{"text":"The food here is THE BEST. The green curry & sukho thai pad thai would be my 'death row last meal' request (if I were to ever get myself in that situation). Truly the best thai food I have ever said. That said, the service kinda sucks and it seems like the restaurant doesn't really care about its patrons. They don't take reservations, either, so be prepared to wait for a table! They do offer take-out as well."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, the first time was probably the most delicious.
It is always always busy, they do not take reservations but the wait is never too long.
The staff are very quick ,efficient and friendly. (Usually i just call in and order take out from here to avoid the wait. )

I have tried their squash fritters, their thai ice tea drink (forgot the name), their Singha brand beer,  both their green curry and red curry, their 3 flavour pad thai and their pad kee mao. 

I would say, out of all that i have tried, the squash fritters are delicious. Their curries are nothing special, their 3 flavour pad thai was delicous initially but since then, i grew to actually dislike it. Its quite heavy, and greasy and it made me feel sick after the last time I've had it. 
Their pad kee mao , the basil threw me off, so i didn't really like that dish much either.
Their thai style iced tea is way too sweet, its sweetness is equivalent to a milk tea bubble tea at 100% sugar level. Imagine drinking that with your greasy dinner, i wasn't a fan. The beer however is good, nice and light.   
 
Overall, I think the food here is good for those who have not tried Khao San Road. It is definitely worth a try for those who love thai food, but it is not one of my favourites that i will be returning to any time soon."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food - really hard to get into. Their service is not the best probably because they are always so busy.
Loved the pad thai street style."}
{"text":"3.5 STARS

For someone who isn't a fan of Thai food, Khao San Road did exceptionally well in providing a fun dining experience.  The place was on fire as it was jammed from 6:30 onward.  People were coming in and out waiting for take out, waiting for tables, watching our food jealously as their stomachs rumbled.

We had a table of 8 so we ordered a lot of apps to start.  The shrimp chips were decently crispy with a nice peppery flavour that lingered on the tongue. The squash chips on the other hand were not as flavourful or exciting, very mild and safe; same sauce for both which was a little boring.  Deep fired sweet potato thingies were okay nothing special.  The salad hand rolls were pretty refreshing as I don't usually like these things, but they were so clean and honest I ate more than I wanted.  

Was not a huge fan of their coconut milk, mushroom, basil, chicken soup.  To be fair I don't like coconut milk as it's too sweet for my tastes, but there was something extremely bitter in mine and it was completely off putting.  Everyone else at the table loved it, so it might've just been me.

The fried tofu was absolutely delicious!  SUPER flavourful, crispy and utterly mouth watering.  Really surprised when I casually tossed one in my mouth.  Might just be the best tofu I've eaten in a restaurant.  Bam.

Onto the mains.  I got the Pad Gra Prao (minced beef on rice with fired egg on top) and it was pretty tasty.  Nothing wow, but a simple, solid, decently made dish.  I wish my egg was bigger, runnier and more awesome.  Should've asked for 3.

The braised beef curry was a total disappointment.  The sauce was good. noodles were okay but the beef was tough and chewy, very sad to eat.

The best dish of the night was hands down their green thai curry.  Now that was a fantastically put together dish with so many flavours, perfect heat, creamy-ness, coconuty-ness, tender chicken-ness.  Going from one dish to the next, it was clear that this one was in a league of it's own.  A god among peons.

There were more dishes but after a while Thai food ends up tasting the same to me.  Blasphemous to some, but truth for me.  I can handle only so much coconut and peanut in one sitting.

One knock I have on the place that is completely irrational is their menu.  It's written in such a way that I had a hard time figuring out what I wanted.  First, the Thai names were of no use to me, and neither were the English phonetics.  The descriptions of all the dishes seemed to start off the same with 'coconut milk curry, and ended with beef $ / chicken $'.  Yes I was super tired and I didn't want to read, but c'mon, make it easier on me =/

Verdict: the best Thai food I've had in Toronto.  Khao San is more than just hype, it's legit."}
{"text":"I live in the area so came here for dinner with some friends as I'd heard good things.  You can't make reservations so we ended up waiting quite a while for a table.  We were then told if we eat on the patio then we couldn't have alcohol but we didn't want to wait longer so we took the outside table.  I guess they need to follow city rules!

I had the shrimp pad thai which was really good and a decent amount of spice.  The food was served quickly and it was good portions but I thought it was kind of expensive for a not so fancy place.  Overall, I would definitely recommend trying it out and I will be going back to sample another one of their excellent dishes."}

{"text":"Great place, loved their food but i'm not a fan of the long wait times."}
{"text":"Good food, reputation well deserved.  It seems to be quite popular as I had to wait even at only 5pm.

Had the Khao Soi and Chef's Special Pad Thai.  Khao Soi was amazing, totally recommend it.  Pad Thai was one of the better Pad Thai's I've had."}
{"text":"We thought Suhko Thai was the best Thai in Toronto...until we tasted the fruits of their offspring - Khao San Road.  Khao San Road is definitely the best Thai in Toronto.  We spoke with the owner, Jeff and without a doubt food preparation and taste is first and foremost on the agenda before anything else at this restaurant.  The Goon Taud Samoon Prai, beef Gaeng Panang, and Pad Thai (Sam Roas) are definitely stand outs that we wholeheartedly enjoyed.  

We went on a Thursday at about 8pm.  Very, very, busy.  I was a 25 minute wait before we were seated, and they only serve wine and beer as libations.  However, once seated service was fairly prompt and the food is absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fave Thai food in the city. So authentic with a hipster ambiance. Here for a late Monday lunch and were seated right away. Servers were very friendly and helpful. We started off with the fresh roll (with chicken sausage) and Thai iced tea (amazing). Had the khao soi - level 3 spicy-ness (perfect amount of spice for me. I wouldn't recommend you go to five if u don't have superhuman tolerance to spicy-ness. U still wanna enjoy the other flavors!). Sip of the ice tea was great to cool down the spice. Chicken pad Thai doesn't disappoint. Prob the best pad Thai ive had. Perfect combo of Thai flavors!

Finding street parking in this area is not the easiest. They also have take out if u must !"}
{"text":"Way too crowded with loud hipsters most of the time. Friendly and efficient servers and owner do come by and check on you 

Highlights: sublime and refreshing tall glass of Thai iced tea; chicken spring rolls utterly delectable; nice big chunks of beef short ribs in the Khao Soi 

Not so great: the spice level at a \"Thai spicy\" was absolutely not so it's important to communicate this properly. Way too many crispy noodles in the Khao Soi to get to the other egg noodles. 

Also unacceptable is not taking Amex. Just don't get why a bustling clearly packed and busy business that thrives on young people with good disposable incomes can't take this card but on the other hand it's not clear that this is hurting them."}
{"text":"A number of months ago my boyfriend suggested going there for dinner because I had a cold. He claimed that eating one of their curry dishes, extreme Thai style, would knock the cold out of me. I woke up the next day feeling a lot better. Thanks, Khao San Road."}
{"text":"To say that I have strong feelings for this place is an understatement. I frequent Khao San Road more often than I visit my parents. I've eaten here 5 times in the past 3 months, and no, this joint is not in my neighbourhood.

My go-to dishes are the red chicken curry and the chicken Bangkok pad Thai. The curry is rich and deep in flavour, it's truly a comfort food. I do feel that there is too much liquid compared to the chicken and veggies in the curry, however I could eat that stuff with a ladle. 

The pad Thai is the best I've ever had. It's the perfect combination of sweet, tangy and spicy. The portion is also very generous. I would like to have someone challenge this pad Thai, I think it would be very hard to beat."}
{"text":"best pad thai in the city! 

I've been to Khao San Road many times, and I've never had any issues. Everything I've had has been delicious!"}
{"text":"This 30 days challenge certainly tells me never get in something that I can not do ......

Last time I was told this place was known as the best Thai restaurant in Toronto when passing there with a friend.  I disagreed with him and still think Sukho Thai is the best.  Till the following Friday I was there drinking the identical Thai Ice tea as Sukho Thai and saw the same owner walking in the door.  Oh well~ I am glad I was right~,

I ordered Pad Thai the street style (how can you say no), same as Sukho Thai, I love the Pad Thai has a little bit sweet in the taste. I saw the other table ordered khao greup faktong, so I added that too. It was good, but it was not the appetizer style I like. 

Comparing to Sukho Thai, the dinning environment is definitely nicer, but for some reason I just missed that small restaurant restaurant with 5,6 tables on Parliament.

P.S. should have mentioned this place is very busy for dinner hour and has line up ."}
{"text":"Guys. For reals- smell the green curry. It smells like kitty litter. Doesn't taste like it- just smells like it. 
But actually though- the food isn't bad. I just think it's a little too pricey compared to the portions. 
Its too loud and you have to sit too close together. 
Also the guy ushering us in needs to chill."}
{"text":"So disappointed!! I came here yesterday and orders $74 dollars of take out. The flavours were not what it used to be! It was packed with a line up but that's no excuse for the quality of the food.. I waited 45 mins til my order was ready and it was disappointing. My papaya salad portion was much smaller than what it used to be, and there was so much water in it I couldn't taste any flavours. I ordered two garlic chicken and they all taste burnt. My two padthais lacked flavours. 

May try this place again since I went here over 20 times but this was the only time
I can say I was truly sadden with the quality of the food :("}
{"text":"This post rates mostly the service. When I go for a sit-down dinner it tend to be hard to get the server's attention, the wait for the food is long, and the environment is very loud, so don't go there if you don't want to shout over the crowd to have a conversation. 

They don't have a good area for ppl ordering takeouts to wait for their orders. Even though they put spare chairs along the bars (facing out) they don't want you to sit there. If they are not for sitting, put them somewhere else! The girl who took my order sounded very unwelcoming. It would have been ok if they asked nicely for me to wait at the front right after I ordered so I know this is what they wanted, but no such instruction was given. I stood/sat by the bar where it looked like a logical place to wait, where there are empty chairs in a row and is away from the dining area, the cash and ordering screen. Then out of the blue the waitress rudely ordered me to move to the front area as if I am a nuisance. When the food is ready, she dropped it in front of me like plopping a bowl in front of a pet. I'm sorry, your food is not so great that I had to beg you for it.  

I find their food over-seasoned and much too sweet than what I had on the streets of Thailand. Just don't expect great service that should have gone with a restaurant at this price point for the type of casual food they are serving. Come to think of it, every time I go I don't have a good experience whether sitting down or taking out, while paying outrageous amounts of money for over-seasoned food that doesn't live up to its original hype. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"This place has good Thai curries that live up to being called Thai food. Still a little on the less spicy side. I ordered spicy and it was medium at best. Only fault is that there were no vegetables at all in either the yellow or Massaman curry. OK there was some potato but thats it.

Its busy, and you may have to wait in line for a while but its worth it. Service is friendly and quite good considering how many people the server is taking care of.

Unfortunately the menu is limited and theres not much for salads..."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of trying this place during a peak time-  Saturday night at 7pm. We were walking down Adelaide looking for the place, when my husband saw an unmarked storefront with a lineup outside. \"I wonder what's going on there\"? he wondered out loud. Then we realized it was the restaurant. 

We were given a wait time of 1.5 hours, so we headed to a pub to kill some time. We came back at 8:30 and we were seated right away. 

We ordered the squash fritters, the Khao Soi, and the Chef's Pad Thai. Here are my reviews:

Squash Fritters: They were not what I expected but they were delicious just the same. They are unlike anything I'd ever tasted, and the sweet and sour sauce they serve with it really elevated things to the next level. You MUST get them at least once.

Chef's Pad Thai: The most complex pad thai ever! It was extremely flavorful and yet perfectly balanced. The chicken was delicious and there were no weird pieces- which is very important to me : )

Khao Soi: It's no wonder this is one of their signature dishes. We ordered it with beef at the recommendation of our server and were not disappointed. The beef was obviously slow cooked, and was so tender that it fell apart on our forks. The rich curry sauce was like heaven.

I would definitely recommend ordering multiple items and sharing. Each dish is so flavorful and rich that it's nice to be able to have some variety. Our bill for the above dishes plus 2 drinks was about $50. Not bad, considering we took enough food home to have it again for dinner the next night. 

While we're glad we waited, we would try to go at a non-peak hour on our next visit.
Maybe it's because we were starving by the time we sat down, but my husband and I agree that this is the best thai food we've ever had. So unique, and yet traditional  at the same time.

If you don't give Khao San Road a try, you're really missing out."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to Kao San Road and built up a high expectation. 

It's amazing how busy this place is all the time! I've been there a couple of times, and we have always sat at the bar (which I love in general) and the staff here are always so great.
The food is really good. I've had a variety of items over the few times I've been and I was not disappointed.

When they ask you how spicy you want it, be honest. Don't try to be a hero."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. I loved the Chef's Special Pad Thai. Don't forget to ask for spicy Thai chilies if you like it hot! My party and I all agreed that this is the most authentic Thai food in Toronto. 

The ambience is modern. However, it can get noisy very fast. I also wish that they would take reservations, but they don't. The service was great; friendly and attentive wait staff. I would definitely visit again. 

Arrive 10 minutes prior to opening to secure a table, as line can be long."}
{"text":"I love the Khao Soi!!! I've never had anything like it before and I love it.

Their sister restaurant Sukhothai is just as good but not as popular. So if you don't want to wait as long, head to that location instead."}
{"text":"This is another place that we frequent, and that everyone we've brought along seems to love. 

Location and Size: Near Adelaide Street West and Spadina Avenue, Khao San Road (affectionately, \"KSR\") is named, I think, after Thailand's Khaosan Road (this hit me when I first Googled directions to the restaurant, and was told that I'm approximately nineteen hours away at present); the surrounding area is full of life, and just steps away from the Fashion District. KSR's space itself is quite small, though not hopelessly cramped (you may have to sit at the bar, or share a table with another group, but you'll have elbow room). The restaurant has both bar seating and seating for four to six people, but this definitely isn't the place for large groups, assuming that all party members want to sit together. Note, also, that you may not be able to hear your conversation partner(s) too well - because KSR is always teeming, it tends to get very loud.

Staff: Most of the established staff are very prompt and personable, and are considerate of vegetarianism, veganism, and other dietary restrictions - upon stating that I'm vegetarian, I was asked whether I eat eggs so that my noodles could be custom-made, if necessary; they also appear to have a whole vegetarian-vegan menu online; I sincerely appreciate that level of awareness. I'm also thankful that they allowed us to order approximately ten minutes before closing, on one occasion.

Prices: Not ridiculously expensive - definitely worth it, for what you're getting. 

Food: The best Thai I've thus far had in Toronto, hands-down. I've had the chance to sample the khao soi, the three-flavors pad thai, the papaya salad, the squash fritters, the garlic tofu, and the pad gra prao. Everything is clearly fresh, and remarkably uniquely flavored - there's a hint of sweet, spicy, and refreshing in every bite, and even fried foods aren't overly oily. Everyone we've thus far taken raves about the squash fritters, khao soi, and coconut water, in particular; I personally love the bite to the three-flavors pad thai noodles, the hint of lime in the squash fritters, and the comforting flavors of the pad gra prao. Even friends who aren't Thai fans have thus far loved what they've had here!

Additional Notes: 
1) No reservations allowed; because this place is almost always full, you may be asked to wait for up to an hour at the door (you can also provide your name, leave, and come back within the allotted time - there's a Starbucks nearby).
2) They're opening a sister restaurant called Nana! See you there!"}
{"text":"Khao San Road is one of my favourite places to go for Thai food - not to mention the place to get soaked during their annual Songkran celebration.  It is named after an actual road in Bangkok, Thailand and its name means \"milled rice\" referencing a time when the street was a major rice market.  Now it is a haven for backpackers and buzzing with nightlife - akin to Mongkok in Hong Kong.

While the original chef, Nuit Regular (Sabai Sabai + Sukhothai) has since left, the food is still yummy.  

While most Thai places offer up ketchupy versions of pad thai and curries so thick of coconut milk that you taste nothing else - you can taste the difference at Khao San Road.  \"We try to order our ingredients from Thailand whenever possible,\" says owner Monte Wan because slight nuances in the flavour of tamarind (Thai vs. local) makes a difference.   KSR wants to be \"as Thai as possible.\"

The Thai iced tea is reminiscent of Vietnamese coffee and is a refreshing and delicious drink to quench summer thirst - if you can get past the sugar rush!  The drink is made of a blend of Thai spices and black tea with condensed milk.  Unfortunately it comes pre-mixed, so no fancy, customized orders à la Starbucks here.  Everyone gets the same.

The garlic tofu is delicious.  I haven't tasted tofu like this anywhere else.  Incredibly smooth on the inside and breaded in a crispy garlic and kaffir lime coating with a sweet and tangy sauce.  If ever there were a vegetarian equivalent to chicken nuggets - this would be it.

The fresh rolls here, again share similarities with Vietnamese cuisine.  But those on a low-carb diet will be happy about the absence of vermicelli noodles.  It's packed with carrots, lettuce, Thai basil, mint leaves and a housemade chicken sausage.  The tamarind sauce topped with peanuts is a welcome addition though the rolls are flavourful in their own right.

Continuing on with the sweet and tangy with a bit of heat is the Tom Yam Soup, the Thai version of a hot and sour soup which has much more complex flavors from lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, lime juice, fish sauce, and crushed chili peppers.  I'd choose this over hot chocolate on a cold, winter's day.

The squash fritters are starchy and sweet like sweet potato fries and is a great nosh.

The crispy rice salad is not yet on the menu but will be coming soon to a table near you.  It is a cold rice salad that has the texture of delicious rice crusts that form at the bottom of Korean/Chinese clay pot rice (usually the best part).  It is sprinkled with thin slices of ginger which add heat and topped with scallions.

Those who can't handle the heat had better stay away from the Kua Ging Pork; curried minced pork with kaffir lime + house made curry paste. The kicker are the peppercorns.  You definitely feel the burn!

The Gaeng Kaew Wan (green curry) with shrimp gets its color from the green chillies and is topped with bamboo shoots, Thai basil + kaffir lime leaves.  As with all of the KSR curries, definitely opt for a bowl of white rice to sop up all the delicious flavors!

An all-time crowd-favorite and one of my own personal favorites is the khao soi; egg noodles in a coconut milk enriched curry, garnished with crispy noodles, green onion, coriander + lime. The beef version is their signature, though you can opt for chicken as well.  I love the textural differences in the noodles.

Two different kinds of pad thai are available; the street-style and KSR's chef's special topped with crushed peanuts, dried chili and freshly squeezed lime juice.  

Khao San Road doesn't take reservations, though the food comes out pretty fast so the turnover is quick.  If you want to avoid waiting then I suggest going right when they open (which at lunch is 11:30am and 5pm for dinner).  While there are many restaurants in the city that adhere to this no reservations policy that are so overrated and totally not worth it - Khao San Road is worth the wait.

*This meal was complimentary, all opinions expressed are my own*"}
{"text":"This is a cool place - loud and fun with good food. We went here before Second City, and the service was a little bit slow, but the food was delicious and the wait staff was friendly and helpful . I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Delicious food. You can't make a reservation...just leave your name and number with the hostess and grab a coffee at Starbucks. ..she'll call and ask if you're still hungry and then tell you that your table awaits...great staff great service   excellent food! Yummy"}
{"text":"Khao San Road is a popular and lively Thai restaurant serving classic Thai curries and noodles. 
The restaurant boasts massive ceilings and a two-storey wall made up of tiles imported from Thailand. The tiles gives the restaurant a hipster feel. 

We started the meal with a milk tea which was refreshing and a side of salad rolls. The salad rolls were fresh and light. 

For the mains, we started with a curry. The curry was delicious and spicy. It comes with a side of rice which pairs well with the curry. We also ordered the pad thai - which was flavourful peppered with fresh ingredients. The pad gra prao was Thai comfort food - a fried egg sitting a top of a bed of rice with beef, red bell pepper and onion.

The service was attentive. The price is slightly higher than other Thai restaurants, but the quality of the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for a year and I can easily say Khao San Road has some of the best Thai food in the city.

Everything is simply delicious from the squash fritters with the wonderful dipping sauce to the tasty shrimp to the fantastic Khao Soi which I recommend ordering with beef. 

The only downside is that it can be tough to get a table. Sometimes you need to show up, put your name down and leave for an hour or two until your table is ready.

Everything is so so good."}
{"text":"I love, love, loved this place. I was wary of the wait time at first but somehow we managed to luck out. It was a Thursday evening, I got to the restaurant at about 5:45 and my boyfriend had beat me by maybe 10 minutes. We sat down on the benches outside, had a quick chat and noticed how many people called on the waiting list couldn't go in. Why? Because all guests must be in attendance to be seated. BRILLIANT! We waited about 10 minutes outside, so maybe 20 all together and got seats at the bar.

I loved the hustle and bustle in the restaurant, everything smelled fantastic! We ordered some beers and the squash fritters to start. The fritters were fantastic! Super filling and flavourful, we ate all of it and it's a mighty tower of root vegetable!

For dinner we ordered the Chef Special Pad Thai and the Gaeng Phed (red curry) and quickly went to town. The portions are very generous and neither of us finished our plates, we ended up bringing half the food home in a take-out container! 

The special Pad Thai is fantastic because it's sweet, sour, savoury and spicy. I've never had a pad thai anywhere close to this delicious. I even hesitate to order it sometimes because it's never good, but here? FANTASTIC. Don't even question it, order it.

Staff were great, everything was in tip-top shape. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Thai places. The Khao Soi and the Thai Iced Tea are amazing. Cannot go wrong with either of those. The wait can be long since they're usually quite busy so just make sure to plan ahead."}
{"text":"Now my favorite thai restaurant in Toronto.  I came by for the second time yesterday with a friend at around 6.30 without reservations.  The only spots were available were the \"patio\" which is really limited in seating facing out to the street, or at the bar.  

We chose the bar which worked out well. As forewarning, dinner took us close to two hours and a big chunk of that was because of the wait for the food - but it was worth it.  I like the ambience - it's kind of minimalist/industrial with plenty of concrete and unfortunately/fortunately quite loud.  The upside is you don't have to worry about too many people listening in.  

Being fans of pad thai (the last time I had a red curry), we shared one each of Pad Thai (Sam Roas) Chicken ($14.00) and Pad Thai (Street Style) Beef ($13.00) to figure out the difference.  Both are great - but we both preferred the Sam Roas (aka three flavors - salty, sweet and spicy) version better because of the flavor and the heat (see pictures of both). The street style on the other hand, was a bit more bland by comparison and sweeter.  

My friend and I (also a guy) were \"waddling\" as another reviewer termed it on the way out - filling without the need of an appetizer.  Definitely would come again.  With reasonable prices, a great space, and amazing food, I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to go to the location at Peter and Adelaide all the time, until it closed down to relocate to this location. That location was always so busy.

Have only been to this specific location once and the food is still as amazing as it was at Peter and Adelaide. My go to is always the Green Curry Chicken. Love it!"}
{"text":"On the whole very tasty.  The red curry at a spicy level of hotness ($8) was good, as was the vegetarian style pad thai ($12).  Also ordered at the table was the Khao Soi ($13) which was raved about and worthy of repeats.

It's difficult to get a seat for a Friday lunch, but Tuesday was pretty relaxed.  Still, you should go early if you don't have a reservation. Definitely a hot spot at the moment."}
{"text":"Waited more than 40 minutes to get seated. The waitress was very nice, but got our orders mixed up. My friend's food came out too spicy for her (because I ordered the spiciest level) and mine was too mild. Being too mild was an easy fix, but my friend couldn't even eat hers. The waitress was adamant that our orders were correct, so that was the end of that. Overall, it's a very hip place to eat. The decorations are cool, and so was the ambiance."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had outside of Thailand, no joke. Consistently amazing, if it's busy you have to wait but believe me it's worth the wait. They don't just do one or two things well, everything I've ordered here is amazing. 

Things to try: Beef salad, crispy rice salad, squash fritters (all appetizers)
mains: chicken or beef pad gra prao (try it spicy), pad thai, khao soi"}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-5
Service-4
Food-4
Strikeouts-0/3

I came here with super low expectations. I was thinking it was some sort of ghetto place, but it's definitely not. Kind of reminds me of a sailor restaurant with all those stools at the bar. If you're not here right at opening, there's always line ups approximating up to 30 minutes.

Once we were seated, it was prompt service with the water. The food also came really quickly after ordering which is really unexpected. We ordered the Thai ice tea, fresh rolls, green curry fried rice, and khao Soi. Each item was impressive in it's own right. The ice tea was definitely unexpected in terms of sweetness probably due to the condensed milk. This drink looks very unique and taste great!! The khao Soi was done soooo well!! Most unique and sweet thing I've ever tried. You would have to try to know what you're missing out. I Definitely would like to come back again in the future and try the rest of their menu!!"}
{"text":"A very crowd place. We went there at lunch time and the place is full of people, so we had to wait 5 mins. I tried their Khao Soi, which was one of the most recommended cuisines. I was OK, but not as good as what other reviews say."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 

Admittedly I didn't go in with high expectations. It's located right in the middle of the club district so I expected something with similar quality to Smokes Poutinery or Burrito Boys. SO much better! Not that I hate either of those.

The atmosphere is fantastic. It's a well-designed, quaint, underground location with a lots of little tables. Both communal and separated. 

The food is amazing. We had the breaded shrimp, the signature pad thai (fuck me, it was good) and the panang curry. And to drink we had two thai iced teas. Which we're rich and creamy. 

The price is cheap. Two drinks, one appy, two mains. For 50 bucks. 

The service is slow. They just opened so they're still finding their feet. But the friendly service more than made up for that. 

My only regret is that I was too full to keep eating. Honestly, after the three dishes I wanted to taste everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Great spot! GO there :) 

1) we didn't particularly like the squash fritters. A decent tasty snack but it's basically deep fried strings of squash with a nice dipping sauce. Maybe a 3/5

2) we shared an entree - pad gra prao It's the last item on the menu. We got it with ground beef and fried egg, and asked for the \"spicy\" sauce. WOW so good. Immensely flavorful beef, everything looked and tasted so fresh. 6/5 -- that good!

3) service and ambience is casual, fast and comfortable. 

4) we saw another couple sharing the fried rice with shrimp, that looked INCREDIBLE. We will try it next time"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place a 7*! I have simply not eaten better Thai food in all of North America and I live in SF Bay Area. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"We went the place on Thursday night at around 8:30pm. We have waited 40mins. It turns out to be quite authentic Decent Thai street food quality with steep price given the long wait and average seating ambience. I am thinking is it worth the wait for the food alone. I wish Toronto has good and affordable street food in the foodcourt kind of environment like in Asia. I can get the same quality of food with cheaper price and without the wait."}
{"text":"Nice place to chill in a pub kind of environment (notice level) food are very good. I'm not a Thai food fan but I would love to go back and try some other dishes

Downside: fast service and high turnover. You can't chill for long. Long line up"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend at 6:30pm on a Friday night. There were probably 15 people at the door waiting for tables when we arrived, but there is a queue set up, so the line was still organized. When we got to the hostess, she told us that there was a 30 minute wait for a shared table. We left our number and we were told to go upstairs to Bang Sue Bar, where we could sit and wait and have the option of grabbing a drink while we did. 
I finally got a call approx. 30-40 minutes later and we were seated at a shared table. It was a little awkward and intimate with strangers, as we could hear each other's conversations, but the food was well worth it. My friend and I both got the Khao Soi. I got mine with chicken, while she got the shrimp. The curry was nice and rich, and I really loved the crispy noodles on top. For the spice level, I chose spicy, but I found that it was barely spicy at all and didn't have the kick that I wanted. I would probably choose a higher spice level next time. 
The portions were quite large and having a small appetite, I was unable to finish mine and had to take some of it to go."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this restaurant by a friend of mine, and we decided to have dinner here. Once we arrived I could tell this restaurant was going to be a great experience, since the restaurant was packed, (there was a line up outside the restaurant), servers were super friendly, and it just felt like a good atmosphere - however take note the restaurant is LOUD. 

Also, if there's a line up to get into the restaurant, your ENTIRE party has to be present before they take your name down to even get a table. 

Once we got settled we decided to get two entrees and to share it. We decided on getting the Shrimp Pad Thai Street Style, and the Chicken Red Curry. Both entrees were DELICIOUS, and filling. We didn't have any room for dessert :(

I'll definitely be coming back though :)"}
{"text":"This is one amazing restaurant. All the rave reviews on Yelp is what brought me here and there's not much I can say that hasn't been said already. The food is some next level of deliciousness. Just be careful with how spicy you order your food. The first time I ordered my chicken khao soi to be spicy and it was perfect. I regret getting Thai spicy the second time but the Thai iced tea did help a lot.

Their menu is short and simple, and they execute it flawlessly. Yes it is a small restaurant and you most likely will end up having to sit elbow to elbow to a stranger at one point or another but the food is so worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and every time I'm pleased with the service and quality of dishes. It's better these days with a smaller line, so just make sure to go at a fairly earlier time. 

It usually takes only a minute or two for the hostess to seat us down and a waitress to approach us with menus upon seating. The servers are generally well acquainted with the menu and are open to recommend dishes if you're unfamiliar with thai food. My personal favourite is the khao soi and green curry (the spicier the better!), washed down with some thai iced tea. 

Overall, can't go wrong with any items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Friday with my sister. Not usually one to give bad reviews but this spot was not worth the hype my coworkers gave it. 

We showed up right at 5pm and we were seated immediately but the only spots left were at the bar. The stools were cramped and our waitress was slow. 

The typical (usually cheap) Singha beer was almost $7. We got the fried squash fritter to begin and it was delicious... although anything deep fried tastes pretty good. Very large quantity for $11. Next both of us got the Pad Thai - my sister got the 3 flavors (veggie) and didn't eat any of it... she's a little picky. I got the regular pad thai (chicken) and thought it was okay... not in my top 5 choices but meh. 

We quickly left as the music was loud and obnoxious and we were surrounded by hipsters. Plus I was tired of being so close to the random beside me lol. 

I'd try it again... maybe it was a busy night or the chef was off or the waitress had a bad day... but all three at once?"}
{"text":"If you like waiting in line and being treated like an inconvenience, then Khao San Road is the place for you.

The food here is fine, but definitely not as good as when the original team worked here. More likely the lineup is due to the fact that it's a small-ish restaurant on Adelaide, which isn't exactly teeming with dining options.

Once you get in, you'll probably be seated at one of the communal high tops at the front of the restaurant. You will not have enough room to enjoy yourself. You will be banged into at least three times, more than likely by a member of the staff. 

When you get your food you will be disappointed by the size. Yes, it will be reasonably tasty, but small. So make sure you invite a dieting friend and eat half of theirs.

Final tip: don't linger. Eat and get the hell out. The staff won't say this to you with words, but that's what the look they're giving you means."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! First timers, I would suggest the red curry chicken. You can't go wrong. There's always a line up, but that doesn't bother me as much...prepare for it. I've introduced this place to many people. The only reason I'm rating it three stars is because the waitresses are unpleasant. It's too bad, because I love the food here!"}
{"text":"Update: It seems two rave reviews in the weekend papers brought out the hungry hoardes. KSR was jam packed tonight. Apparently, the phone has been ringing nonstop all day. They are that busy. Yayy for them but expect long queues or go early!
I had the red chicken curry and the most delightful chicken nugget-type things. (apologies for not remember the name). Those nuggets were tender, juicy, savoury little pillows of deep fried joy. The curry was wonderful as well, perfectly balanced between the salty, sweet, sour and spicy intensity. 
I'm gonna eat my way through the entire menu before this year is through. :-P"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Thai is one of my fav types of food, and this place definitely lives up to it. There is a bit of wait as the restaurant seems to be always busy. I recommend take out but if not then wait. It is worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The first time I attempted to have dinner here, I was welcomed to wait 45 mins for the next seat. So knowing that this place was popular and thus good, I was determined to sip the golden curry that I say through the window of khao San road.

A couple of days later I returned with optimism and high expectations. It was a weekend and it was lunchtime so the tables were available but still crowded. After sitting down at the bar I immediately liked the atmosphere. It was well-lit, simple and in motion. Servers constantly walked to and fro from the kitchen to the tables. This gave my gf and I a sneak peak of what we could potentially have.

My gf settles for paneang curry and I a khao San special egg noodles in coconut curry with braised beef, veggies and fried wonton strips. After a 15 minute wait our food came out in great presentation. It was simple but made each ingredient standout in the dish.

Mine was delicious. A sweeter yellow curry withe the most tenderous beef chunks. A thick curry sauce that was perfect for smothering the aged jasmine rice they use here. Apparently the aging gives off a continuous and individual fragrance while in curry. The combination was absolutely ridiculous. My gf received the green curry with chicken and bamboo shoots. A much lighter and thin curry that complimented the rice included very well. My gf especially liked the kafir lime leaves and basil, it made the dish for her.

You may be wondering, why I mentioned that she ordered panang curry and then reviewed the green curry. Well, there was a slight mix up in the kitchen, she got the wrong dish. As soon as we had let them know, one of the co-owners was soon beside us to apologize. What a great guy! He offered to pack the first dish up for us and bring out the right dish for free.

This guy knows how to service his customers. With such a minor mistake, he made great steps and effort to make it right. I really appreciated that. After we got our third dish, all of the servers were especially kind and accommodating.

What did we think of the panang? It was of course also delicious. With the basil and lime leaves again, my gf really liked it. It was a drier curry compared to the green curry which was thinner and soupy. This curry was thick and stuck to the chicken and veg a bit better. Less sauce than both my dish and the green curry, this one was more reminiscent of a stir fry.

Overall, out experience here was fantastic. Probably biased by the free meal and opportunity to speak with an owner, the food is honestly great. I haven't had this many types of curry in Toronto ever. All were exceptional with their own flavours, aromas, spiciness and thickness. I have to compliment the

For offering a unique and well executed meal for me. Great new tasting flavours, affordable prices, full service and casual atmosphere.This is what dining should always be!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Location is great. The servers were friendly and generally prompt. Never fails to please. 

You can get reservations here, but I called aobut 3 days before, and they were not taking any more for around 730.  We got there at 8pm and waited about 20 mins. All was good, and feel free to grab a drink at the bar. Say hi to Sunny, a good high school friend of mine. 

I have to say that I still would rather go to Sukho Thai. Although this is subway accessible, I drive and parking here cost me $7 for two hours. I know better now. Also, their sister restaurant is not as busy and has similar foods but cheap by at least $4. 

Case in point - my favourite the Khao Soi. 
We also got the Thai Sausage rolls in rice paper, and the pad thai (i hate pad thai, and this one was excellent). 

You can also choose your level of spicy, medium was good for someone that like spicy food, but doesn't want a lot of it. 

For 2 people we shared this meal, and I was OVER STUFFED and waddling out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Friends treated us to a meal at Khao San Road and it was really great! it has a good atmosphere and simple setup that makes you feel comfortable! The food tastes fresh and decent sizes! 

I recommend making reservations or getting there early as it is usually busy! I cannot wait to go back!! :)"}
{"text":"Khao San Road never disappoints - I love the garlic prawn appetizer, the pad gra prao, massaman curry, khao soi and the bangkok style pad thai. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Came back for a second visit, had a better visit than last time and left as very happy customers! Wait time we were told was about an hour, but we were called after waiting only about 15 min. We ordered the squash fritters, 3 flavours pad thai and pad gra prao. Everything was superb - food had adequate spice but still good flavours, service was quick and we had a lovely night overall.  Probably the best pad thai I've had in the city."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for the moment to try Khao San Road for forever. This was my first time as I've never had the patience to wait for more than 10 minutes at their old location. This time, we got seated right away when we came at dinner time on a weekday.

First things first, the restaurant exuded great vibes - the crowd was vibrant and the music was blaring. Unfortunately, the bar table space where they seated us, and the majority of customers, was extremely cramped. We were elbow to elbow with the parties on either side, it was hard to maneuver when eating, and overall not a good dining experience, especially if you are trying to have a conversation.

I was not disappointed in the food though. The Papaya Salad was refreshing; the Pad Thai, which I  was perfectly chewy, tangy and spicy. My friend ordered the Khao Soi and although she felt it was quite heavy, I thought it packed a punch. Servings are generous and we left completely stuffed.

All in all, the food outweighs the seating situation, so I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place yesterday. I would its say it's pretty good but when you factor in how cramped it is inside, the long lineups, lack of parking it doesn't deserve the accolades it's been getting. The food is good, however Sukhothai is better. The only reason I'll come back is for that minced beef on rice dish which is pretty outstanding. The fresh rolls.. meh, squash fritters.. meh and the pad thai is as good as Sukhothai. Anyways, I came , I saw, and it didn't become a part of me."}
{"text":"Like many others have said, it lives up to the hype.  I can understand not wanting to wait 2 hours, so if you can, just go and sit on your own at the bar and do some hipster  -- uh - - I mean -- people watching.  The service is really friendly and they kept my suitcase near the register while I ate."}
{"text":"It was everything we were told it would be!  We shared 3 courses with one from each category and an appie for 4.  Could use one more if really hunngry.  They were all unique and fresh.  It was busy and we had to wait 45 minutes but went down the street for a drink to wait for phone call that table was ready. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Impromptu visit here with friends. First of all, kinda weird where they place the entrance, which is actually their exit. It was crowded so the food speaks for itself. Decor is more modern and simple. Menu is also straight forward but would be nice to have pictures to look at, as the waitress seems not able to understand what I was describing. Maybe I couldn't pronounce the words properly.

I ordered coconut water, and there was some grits in there which I don't know what it is. I told the waitress. Under normal circumstances most places would quickly offer to replace it but she just looked at the glass and said maybe it's from the can.

The main dish pad gray prow that I ordered is pretty good though. I actually have no idea what it is but it's satisfying and although I really want to finish it I could not. So portion is good if you have an appetite. 

One thing my companions have commented on though, is their level of spiciness. I personally always ask for mild and felt it was okay, but my friends felt their spicy is not spicy enough. We didn't have the fish though so hard to compare.

When it comes to pay it was most silly. They do not allow us to pay by credit card individually, but said it's okay if 3 cards are used on the table. At first I thought that it meant we will just figure out the cash amongst ourselves, but then turns out the waitress comes around getting cash from us individually, crossing off the items we ordered from the one bill for the table. How is this more convenient for them?"}
{"text":"Some of the best thai food in the city, I prefer take-out as they do not accept reservations and usually you are in for a long wait. MUST TRY : Massaman Curry with Beef, Pad Gra Prao and Bangkok-style Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Crowded and loud but the food is worth it if you're not in a hurry.  The spring rolls were a great starter and thank goodness we ordered the appetizer because the wait for our entrees was almost 30 minutes. The Bangkok style pad Thai was very good. And the portions are generous."}
{"text":"The food is unique and tasty. It's worth the wait if you're dying for Thai food. However, the only downside is the wait can take a long time. Thankfully takeout is an option."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and really had a craving for Drunken Noodles. Though there were many Thai places around the area, this restaurant seemed to be the most inventive and had great reviews. It was during Caribana and it was also a holiday weekend so the line was to be expected but seeing as I was ordering my food to go, I was hoping that the wait would not be as long. 

The wait took a long time and there was no place to sit and wait. Literally had to go to the sub store next door to wait. The hostess was also very rude to people as they waited to be served. She almost got into a heated argument with a patron as well which is why I'm giving them 4 stars.

Otherwise, the food is AMAZING and I love how you can be very specific about the spice level. I ordered drunken noodles with chicken and a pad Graw po (sp)which had chicken and the egg on top. Sooooooo good and soooooo flavorful. Would definitely order both again but I would call ahead first. They also take cards with chips which is great for International travelers. 

Overall - best thai food I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Pad Thai. EVER. in Toronto.
I always come and get the 3 flavor pad thai, because I love the cilantro they put in there!
Wait times are long most of the time, but how can they help it? Everybody wants a taste of their food! Thai iced tea and their Pad Thai, I'd love it anytime.
Their service is average. But I wouldn't use that to discriminate against the food. Pretty loud here, so if you want an intimate atmosphere, forget it lol."}
{"text":"Khao San Road had been on my list of places I wanted to go to eat for YEARS. But never got around to actually going to, for one reason or another. Finally I managed to make it to this restaurant. I'm going to separate the food, ambiance, and service to discuss seperately.

Food - I ordered the pad gra prow. It was delicious. It had a great mix of flavours and the way that it was plated was really interesting and tasty. This place has amazing food!

Ambiance - It was pretty nice for the most part. It was a bit crowded and it was hard to hear the people that I was talking to, but at the same time it gave an interesting atmosphere.

Service - It was AWFUL. We waited 20 minutes for a table, and the lady said we had to have everyone together to be seated. This was fair enough. However, one of my friends had to take an urgent phone call, and stepped out for a few minutes and the server came over and started yelling at us for getting seated without our entire table ready. It took my friend almost 15 minutes to order a single beer, and the servers were rude as fuck. I understand they are busy but that's not an excuse to treat your customers this way.

In summary, I had really mixed feelings about this place. The food lived up to what i expected, but the service was awful."}
{"text":"We came here back in May 2015 and again this past weekend. When we were here in May (must have forgotten to do a write up for that!) it was a great experience. We replicated it this time, even eating at the same spot at the bar. It was probably ~7pm when we were here and it was packed both times. We had a 20 minute wait. Usually you can wander around the neighborhood and the hostess will give you a call when your table is ready but being so chilly, we just waited in the vestibule area. We ordered a couple of Singah's while we waited. 

We ordered an appetizer of squash fritters which are deep fried and a million times tastier than french fries! Unfortunately we filled up on these and being unaccustomed to deep fried foods, they made us feel sick later on :(

I also ordered the Three Flavours Pad Thai, which is the classic flavored pad thai. I got it with medium spice, with more spice on the side. Note to self, will probably get mild with medium on the side next time. And I am normally adventurous about spicy food! If you don't mind fishy flavors, try the Bangkok pad thai. We also ordered the Khao Soi, which was flavorful but a bit rich for our palettes. The coconut milk flavor is good though! Also ordered this one too spicy -probably would've enjoyed it better with mild spice level. 

The Singah beers are great -gives you that authentic Thailand feel! We recently honeymooned in Bali and the Bintang beers there remind us of the Singah beer at Khao San Road. Brought back great memories for us! 

Would recommend Khao San Road to anyone who hasn't been. There is another place down the road that our concierge had also recommended but had a much longer wait. Might try that one next time."}
{"text":"\"We decided to be social and dine at the stainless steel bar counter, on highchairs.\"
\"Our plates for sharing were small and flat. It proved particularly difficult to share the Khai Soi.\" \"This lovely dish consisted of egg noodles and chinks of beef submerged in a bowl of golden curry and coconut milk.\"
Just a few bites from our full review"}
{"text":"The Bangkok Style Pad Thai gave my friend food poisoning! She was violently ill and throwing up all night that she had to go to the hospital. Her boyfriend had a couple bites and he had diarrhea all morning.

They think it was because of the chicken in the pad Thai. BEWARE!"}
{"text":"KSR and Pai are extremely popular establishments in the DT core. I visited the old KSR on several occasions and remember the food/atmosphere very well. It was my first visit since they moved and I didn't quite enjoy myself like I thought I would. They definitely upped the hipster vibe, that's for sure. Me thinks the entrance used to be at the front but they locked it and guests now have to go around the corner in the alley, walk into a stairwell before entering through the back? 

The atmosphere is still bumpin' but there is certainly something missing. They had ONE server on the floor during the lunch rush. My party ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down and it legit took 45 minutes for the food to arrive. It seemed as though they were very busy handling take-out orders (Ritual, Mealpal, Foodora, UberEats, etc.) 

Food was aite but it ain't what it used to be. Ordered the Khao Soi + chicken and there was barely any meat. Tons of curry soup leftover. Portions are small and for that price I'd rather go try other Thai places in the vicinity. 

Kind of disappointed. 
3.5"}
{"text":"I would recommend this to ANYONE. 

The restaurant has a super cool vibe, playing great old school hip hop/music which isn't too loud, letting the room be filled with fun and conversation. 

Servers are quick and efficient, super friendly, & they recommend dishes based on your needs which is always awesome when the menu has so many great things on it. 

I walked past someone's table and spotted the Khao Soi & had to have it, after the server told me what it was I took it with Chicken & oh boy was it good. I even had enough left for lunch the next day. 

Great prices. Recommending it to all my friends already. Go!"}
{"text":"So delicious. Well worth the wait every time I come! So flavourful. The Thai iced tea is so refreshing and the shrimp chips are great to munch on.

I have been several times- each time the line up is out the door but if you can wait it out you won't be disappointed! 

Every dish looks amazing and IS amazing. The atmosphere is fun and it's never empty. 


I will go back....again and again."}
{"text":"This place is brilliant! I absolutely love the food; although, to be fair, I ALWAYS get the same thing, the Khao Soi. It's so delicious, that every time I go there, I can't bring myself to even try anything else. And almost without fail, everyone else at the table gets the same thing too! It's absolutely delicious! 

My only complaint about this place is the long wait time! But I suppose that can't be helped given it's popularity."}
{"text":"First time in Toronto and having Thai tea the food came out so quick and the service was very friendly and welcoming. Everything was fresh and authentic with a twist of modern. Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"An excellent thai restaurant in Toronto. We waited over 85 minutes for a table (restaurant does not take reservations) as it was a beautiful and sunny day and waiting outside with our friends was relaxing and fun, but I wouldn't go back again if I had to wait a fraction as long, as the food is excellent, but I prefer places that take reservations. Once seated we encountered a loud, simple, unpretentious restaurant with good service, a small menu and wonderfully tasting Thai food. 

We started with the soup of the day; Thom Kha Gai (coconut chicken soup) and it was the best I have tried in the city. Not spicy (would have liked a little spice) but warm, sweet and bold in flavours. 

Next we had the squash fritters: my friends loved them. To me, they were mostly delicious breading deep fried, but not much squash to be found. 

Then we had the garlic shrimp appetizer: the best shrimp I have ever had. So flavorful, so well prepared. Just amazing. 

For mains we ordered the: chefs special phad Thai w shrimp, panang chicken, and, minced chicken. All were perfectly prepared, savory, and delicious. 

On the downside: the menu is really small...not a lot of choices.  The portions are small, so order more than you think you will need. The restaurant is very loud and cramped, and lastly, don't forget, they don't take reservations and the wait was absurd."}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic style dishes. Lots of first dates going on. Nice, chilled atmosphere. Very popular though, don't expect to be seated unless your entire party is present."}
{"text":"Gotta agree with others.. management kinda messed up here in the whole re-location plan.  I just don't see the point.  It's still too loud and still has too many shared tables.. and is laid out in a weird, disjointed way.  I don't overly love the new décor either.  Still a busy place because of the great food, so again, the entrance is a cluttered mess of people.

On to the food.. excellent.  Pad Thai is slightly different in texture than before (more moist).  I always see people getting the Khao Soi, which I actually think other Thai places in the city (even in the immediate vicinity) do better than KSR.  Red/green/panang curries all outstanding.  Service is about what you'd expect, depending on the girl you get.. marginal but totally acceptable."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai joint in Toronto"}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere at this super popular place. This is a party pad, price point is good for a downtown location. Prepare for a line up on a Friday after work."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious! Long wait on the weekends but it's worth it. Try visiting on a week day to skip the line. One of the most delicious (and I hear authentic) places in Toronto. Must try!"}
{"text":"Food was great,
but the setup is terrible like when i say terrible, probably up there with the worst of setups.  It's like a lunchroom in high school and your squished in so close to others that your pretty much can participate in their conversations and rub elbows with strangers.  I would rate the place maybe a 4 star but because of the setup it's just too awful, and inconsiderate not to mention the over and hour wait to just get in.

I'd say it would be great for take out only."}
{"text":"On second visit we tried the other pad thai, street style. 

Having tried both, I would recommend the Sam Roas style!"}
{"text":"Went here after work on a weekday.

In general I'm a super big fan of this style of Thai food (not familiar enough to know what it's called, but whatever they make is what I want whenever I think of thai food now.

Their iced tea is amazing, and unique (or maybe regional) and I dream about it.

My one knock is that the restaurant is smallish and crowded for the area and you are likely to be crammed into a group table alongside other people."}
{"text":"smart to make a reservation? YEs absolutely!

Always will order the thai ice tea (maybe a little bit more rich in the tea flavor for me... can appreciate more condense milk next time )
-loved their street pad thai.. spicy style which is great!! quite different. 
BUt I LOVE LOVE their khao soi? can'tget enough of the flavor..."}

{"text":"There is 66 reviews so I'm not going to go crazy here. I went to Khao based on the recommendations I've seen here and I was so SO impressed with the food. Its now my #1 go to for Thai food. 

Everything there I just want to put into my mouth again. EVERYTHING. And god knows I ordered enough things off the menu...."}
{"text":"Khaosan Road...  

For now it's one of many worldwide destinations I can foresee myself travelling to when next I fly out of this continent.  If you haven't realize, I base my logs/reviews as if they're travel logs therefore rarely visiting any place more than once even if it's my local territory.  I guess you can say I'm a Tourist even in my hometown.

Khao San Road, the restaurant actually started my Journey as I brought my carry-on luggage to eat with some local Yelpers in Downtown Toronto.  I met up with an insane-prolific local Yelper and a couple Thai food-experts.  It's hard not to be intimidated in their presence but we hit it off as Yelpers tend to do.

A few steps down the entrance, you get that lively vibe and semi-warm while keeping stylish atmosphere with less Thai cliche than most restaurants of the kind tend to over-do.  As I dragged my luggage across to to the back table, I feel the coziness within as most of the space felt comfortably narrow.  What do I mean, it's up to you to discover.

While within table-to-table I had enough space to place my carry-on between another table's seat and mine as I got down and dirty dissecting the menu.  From an overview standpoint, it seems slight repetitive as half the Starters had \"Garlic\", while Mains/Noodles/Specials are \"Curry\" dominant.  Not necessarily bad as I found out later on...

Chai Yen($4.50)  -  Thai Iced Tea, overly sweet overwhelms Tea & Spice notes.

Squash Chips($5.00)  -  Fresh, crisp, soft, sweet, savoury.  TRY

Gaeng Massaman(Shrimp $15.00)  -  A Tamarind based stew if you will.

It wasn't until I tried some of my Friend's Pad Thai[(Sam Roas)(Chicken $14.00), Pad Gra Prao(Beef $13.00), and Pad Kee Mao(Tofu $12.00) that I've realize where the flavour lies.  No doubt even if you do not get THAI-SPICY, you should at least get more than the mild spiciness as it helps intensify some of the flavours.   3.5'd

Price vs. Portion reflects the Lease payments I believe, if not then we were seriously overcharged.  My stomach-satisfcation felt comfortable but not full, so ordering multiples and sharing Tapas method is how I believe works best for most consumers.

I'm sure I'll visit Khaosan Road in the future, which one it'll be is the true \"?\" mark."}
{"text":"After a couple of days in Toronto, we were craving some Asian food. There was quite a variety of Thai places to choose from, but we decided to try Khao San Road. I have to admit that I was disappointed that they did not have pad see ew on the menu (how could you??) so I went with the pad thai. Khao San Road offers two types: pad thai sam roas or pad thai street style. The main difference? Street style means you get no peanuts and fewer variety of sauces included. Fine by me! I waived out of including vegetables, so my dish came to me with just noodles, tofu, and beef. Now that's my kind of pad thai! Their portions are decent, though I was able to down all of my food in one sitting. Thai tea costs $4.50 (!!) so be prepared to pass on it or pay a lot for what you can normally buy at $2 or less elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food here is very good, probably one of the best thai places in town. My favourite is the Massaman Curry because it tastes like an Iranian stew called Khoresht Fesenjoon. This curry is apparently actually influenced by Middle Eastern cuisine and you can taste it in the flavour. The squash fritters are excellent as well. Head upstairs and there is a separate bar. Their oysters are really good and as for drinks the caesar is awesome if you like it spicy (tip: ask for the thai sriracha to be added to your caesar, it is pretty spicy but amazing!). Now, why am I giving this place a 4 star even though I love the food? I think for what you get the food and drinks are much too pricey here. This is a pretty casual restaurant and the service is meh. Another thing is the bar upstairs and the restaurant downstairs are two separate entities, and I never understood this. It makes the experience difficult. You actually can't order any of the drinks or anything from the menu from upstairs to enjoy downstairs, or vice versa. The wait at this place is already pretty long, why make me wait twice to spend more money at your establishment? It makes no sense. To be honest, I can get over the prices if the restaurant's overall management improves."}
{"text":"Arrived in town on business on a very busy Friday night. Placed my name with the hostess, waited a good 20 minutes then noticed she proceeded to seat duos and trios who had come in after me. Even when spaces at the bar opened up. With the exchange rate so good I had planned to try a few entrees, and have a few glasses of wine after a long day of travel. I guess the hipsters drinking tap water and splitting a starter who would linger twice as long as me had better money?"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai foods in Toronto. The only problem is the wait since there is no reservations."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about...seems like regular thai food to me...the place is overall a bit too \"trendy hipster\" for me and the line ups are usually too ridiculous."}
{"text":"gawd, was that delicious or what...

went during busy lunch time, so there was about fifteen minute wait...  but when i was sat at the bar, food came fast and was AMAZING

i had tofu appy and market pad thai, food comma and food baby was all worth it.."}
{"text":"Great Thai food (particularly the fried chicken or shrimp appetizer and any of the curries). The prices are reasonable although slightly above what you might expect to pay at other Thai spots - likely due to the ownership and its target customer...i.e. yupsters and the like.

The wine list could be more expansive (particularly the white which tends to pair better with Thai food). They only had Reisling by the glass. Also, there was a bottle of champagne (from Champagne, FR) on the menu for $85 that seemed out of place...who's ordering that?!

The music is quite loud so probably not a good first date spot but not so loud that I had to shout. Also, they were good tunes.

The owner (I think) came over to chat with us and to ask us how the meal was, etc. so I really appreciated that. They have some tables at the back by the kitchen that probably shouldn't be tables...why do restaurants do that? They know that no one wants to sit there....

The staff was nice. Food came quickly. I would go back if and when in the area (which is somewhat desolate at night but close enough to some action that its not so bad....)"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food restaurants in Toronto. I love how there is a lot of variety of food. Very authentic from food court restaurants like thai express. The dough fritters are a good recommendation for app and you must try the thai ice tea."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is a real gem.  We opened the door to the restaurant, and a wave of delicious smells wafted over us.  The restaurant was quite busy, but we were seated almost immediately.  Much of the seating is family style--with each party given a portion of a shared tall boy table, and a bar stool on which to sit.  Overhead lighting is bright, but warm.

We started with spring rolls and fried shrimp.  The rolls were light and citrusy.  The shrimp had light breading, the perfect amount of spice, and was accompanied by a perfectly balanced sauce.

The three flavors pad Thai was fantastic--great texture on the noodles and vegetables, and a perfectly peanuty sauce.  We also tried a pad gra prao--spicy beef over rice, with a light fish sauce.  The restaurant let's you select a spice level for each dish.  We went with \"3\", which is spicy, but one level short of Thai Spicy.  Next time, we may upgrade to Thai Spicy.  The meal was washed down with icy cold Singha--absolutely great.

Our server was charming, and well informed on the menu.

A fantastic Thai alternative in the Entertainment District."}
{"text":"I walked past this new location a few times while trying to find it (lol I'm a little directionally challenged) so make sure you look carefully! The sign is kind of hard to see. I came in at around 11:30am, which is when the restaurant opens, and it was already quite packed with people inside. 

Nonetheless, the service was great - was approached by both the hostess and our server really quickly. Everyone seems pretty friendly even though the place is always so busy. This new location is bigger than I remember the others to be. There are two floors so hopefully the long waits won't happen too much here. 

As for the food, I absolutely love the Three Flavoured Pad Thai. I've been to Khao San Road a few times now, and have ordered this dish every time. It just never fails to impress me - it's always super tasty with lots of unique and distinct flavours compared to other Pad Thais that I've tried. Simply delicious! The Thai Iced Tea is awesome as well and I would definitely recommend trying it for yourself. It has an amazing kick to it and gives you a more complete feel of an authentic Thai meal. I haven't tried any of the other items yet but I will surely be back to do so."}
{"text":"With 746 and counting reviews (mostly positive), there's little need for me to add to the noise. The food was good! If you're downtown, and you are in the mood for thai food, I'd recommend you take the Khao San Road to currytown (feel free to scroll down and check for 'road' jokes, I'm sure it's not original.)

Here are my recommendations based on a single meal:

LINEUP
There will likely be one. We arrived before 6 on a frigid Tuesday evening following Family Day. We waited. If you don't like lining up, listen: despite the fact that I drank the leftover curry sauce like a soup, delivery thai food is available in toronto. Just do that instead.

MAINS
We had the Khao Soi with shrimp, and a Bangkok Pad Thai with Tofu. Plates were cleaned. Sauce was slurped. Tiny dried shrimps helped pretend I was a giant. My only concern was that the curry should have come with extra rice, because it seems obvious that I would want to employ that incredible sauce a little more. Of course, I didn't ask for any, so who knows if they would have accommodated on request (still though...I mean, you make a delicious thing but don't provide a vehicle to finish it? Thank god I have no shame and am willing to drink curry like it was a beverage). Both dishes were in the $15 range. It costs an extra $2 for most dishes if you want fish or shrimp, FYI.

DESSERT
Tiny tapioca balls in coconut pudding - YES. So tasty, such a pleasure to eat, and without making me feel like I just ate a cup of sugar. Possibly a little on the expensive side ($5), but worth a try.

PARKING (see: service)
Around the corner on Widmer for 7 bucks (after 6pm, Sunday to Thursday). Don't waste your money on street parking or the 10 dollar lot across the street. If you get there before 6, well, you're on your own. Rush hour on a weekday? Yikes. Take the TTC.

SERVICE
Overall the service was fine. One quibble: when we arrived, I dropped off my GF and ideled, so she could see if a table was available, then take that table, and give me a thumbs up so I wouldn't otherwise pay for parking if the wait was too long to bear. She came out and told me that they wouldn't sit us until all members of our 2-person party had arrived.

Okay. If you are an otherwise reservations-taking restaurant, and a non-reserved party shows up, I can understand this policy. But if I park, then find out I have to wait 40 minutes, I'm going to be pretty upset. When your known-to-have-lineups restaurant is located on a busy, parking-deficient street like Adelaide, you are going to have to sometimes accommodate this situation. I rushed to a lot around the corner, then sprinted to the restaurant. Thank goodness I beat the next party of 2, but knowing this issue will arise next time, it is a surefire way to ensure I will never drive to the restaurant again. Of course, who would TTC or cab to a restaurant they may have to lineup 40 minutes to an hour for? Anyone else see the inherent problem here?"}
{"text":"Clean and warm interior (wooden tables and chairs that remind me of eating outdoors at the beach), simple menu but exquisite items.  there are familiar entrees (pad thai, tom yum soup) and some original items (egg noodles in panang curry with melt in your mouth lamb chunks).  tom yum soup was really tangy and not too salty like it often is at other thai restaurants.  thai iced tea was refreshing too - not too sweet or syrupy.  as with the soup it was just the right balance of flavors.  

 thai restaurants often try for a \"modern concept\" in its decor, but this place was well designed, well planned out.  

service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The deep fried tofu appetizer is excellent. Crispiness of chicken fingers only lighter. Spring roll sauce is the most flavorful I've had, and has a bit of kick. 

That orange drink you see all over the place that looks like pureed sweet potatoes is pretty friggin' awesome and unique. Don't think I've had anything like it before, but will have it again. 

Geang Massaman is very good (rice and curry dish). Creamy and flavorful, though the potato chunks were the only thing I would change. A little big, and feel out of place. When you eat them they just taste like potato, not like something thats gelling with the rest of the ingredients. 

Their Pad Thai has a much deeper, richer flavor than most. You can taste the noticeable absence of ketchup ;)

Overall a great place welcoming decor. I particularly like wood tables. We're here during the Thursday dinner rush and the place is packed, which is making it feel kind of understaffed. We've been done for a while but haven't got our bill. But at least the people in line are patient. I guess that's what good food will do.

$50 for my wife and I includes 2 mains, one appetizer, one drink plus tax and tip. For Thai you might think that's expensive, but the difference in quality you pay for is very apparent."}
{"text":"Tasty! I give it 4 stars mainly for the pad see ew. Pad see ew done well is amazing and this was done amazing! There was just enough sauce to give it flavor without making the noodles mushy. Noodles had a great texture and just sopped up the sauce perfectly. The vegetables weren't overcooked. We got ours with chicken. I wanted to guzzle the sauce. 

We also had the massaman curry but it was really tart/vinegary maybe from too much tamarind. Ordered the fresh rolls and they were ok.. didn't like the texture of the steamed ground chicken on the inside. Portions were generous, we had 2 entrees and one appetizer and split it between 2 people.

Wait was short, but it's crowded and hard to have conversations. I really liked the modern decor, it's cozy just like the other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"I've heard of this place for a while now, but we always wanted to try it when it wasn't too busy.

Walking into Khao San Road at 11:20am (10 minutes before they open), we were able to get a view of the beautiful tiles in Khao San Road. These wonderful tiles stretched from the floors all the way to the top of a two story floor. There wasn't a wait line when we got there - closer to lunch, many people came in for lunch. Washrooms are located on the second floor, which was home to a bar.

For the weekday lunch, we decided to order a curry of the day, which was the panang curry ($11.85) and one of the signature dishes, a Khao Soi ($14.95). The dishes came pretty quickly, it might be because we were the first ones there, but they are quite small compared to the typical portions served in Toronto. 

The Panang curry came with a small scoop of rice and another bowl with a bit of curry and lots of chicken (we had the chicken option). The curry was quite tasty and was very rich in herbs. It wasn't too spicy as we were able to choose a variety of spice levels.

I REALLY LIKED THE KHAO SOI. Coming in a thick curry broth, the noodles were not my favourite, but we ordered an extra jasmine rice for $3. The curry was sort of sweet and delicious, perfect for a curry rice. Extremely tasty!! The Khao soi also had crispy topping added to it giving the plating points an extra A++!"}
{"text":"The food here are amazing.

The chicken rolls tastes very different with a very strong Thai basal flavour.

Khao Soi is absolutely must-try.

Also the ice tea is delicious."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this restaurant to me and has labelled it as one of the best Thai restaurants in Toronto. She also advised me that it is a fairly popular restaurant and small in size so it would be wise to go early or else you will be forced to wait in line for a table. 

Taking her advice seriously, my husband and I went just a few minutes before it opened at 5PM and as we approached the restaurant we noticed there was already a line up outside the doors. Seating people went by quickly though but the place filled up fast . They do allow shared seating (ie. antisocial couples may not want to share a four seater with another couple) but my husband and I didn't mind doing this and found it did not taint our overall experience.

As I stated before, the place is small and seating is limited. Inside you will find a very simple and clean decor. The atmosphere of the restaurant is cozy and casual. The staff were friendly and the service was very prompt and efficient; we did not wait long for the food to be cooked and served.

For an appetizer my husband and I shared \"Gra Bong\" which consisted of grated and fried squash fritters. I loved the squash fritters! They were not too greasy and were flavourful in taste with hints of ginger and lemongrass.

For the main I ordered the Pad Gra Prao which was basically stir fried minced beef with holy basil topped with a fried egg and served on rice. You have the option of adding spice to it but I decided to stick to a mild version of this dish. The meal was a little on the sweet side so if you are looking for salt and spicy this dish isn't for you. The overall taste was delicious and I will likely order it again.

Overall, great experience. Great food. Great service. It does get busy so be prepared to wait for a table!"}
{"text":"I wish that we could tell what the food would be like just by the look of the restaurant but we can't. 
The food at Khao San Road, which is an actual place I used to frequent during my gap year between highschool and college seeking out cheap eats and drinks with my fellow gap year friends that was known as the cheap grungy backpacking district with cheap eats and drinks... thus the .. nvm. Anyways, the food here is actually really good. It's delicious, well presented, and not uber generous but certainly not stingy in portions. Their menu is limited but smart with dishes that they do extremely well. It is the kind of food that I expect to find in a Thai.. well what would be comparable to a diner... Delicious, fresh, and pretty fast. 
But what I did not appreciate was how loud and how long the wait was. The wait for me personally was not that long but we beat the lunch crowd on a Saturday morning. Noise and wait, are two parts of the experience that just cannot be disconnected from the rating and brings it down a star. :( 
They probably keep it loud so that people leave quickly!
The decor was fantastic and I wish I had had my own phone with me to snap away but I'm sure I'll be back to enjoy it soon enough."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Literally any dish here is great.  Been eating here for about a year now and it is one of the best places.  If it is your first time, try the Khao Soi, it will blow you away.  Service is stellar, food is great, people are nice.  It's a little small and theirs usually long lines, but its well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome!! Good food very nice waiters, onky problem if you are looking for a place to chill and talk this isnt it. Can get really crowded plus the music is too loud. But food is right on!! Must go to again before leaving Toronto"}
{"text":"This place is TOO BUSY for their own good. Please hire more people! 

They never pick up the phone! The wait in line is 1-2 hours!  The service when inside is nothing to write home about either! 

The food is good. In Toronto its one of the top Thai places to go to. But depending on what you fancy, I have had better. I'm a curry guy and I was a little dissapointed at Khao San. I also had a few of their appetizers and those also weren't anything amazing.

If you love curry you have to try Little Bangkok (and get the coconut rice). You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, there's usually a line up but not too bad if you're with a small group. The food is consistently good but it's not amazing. I really like the thai ice tea, even though it's 75% ice. Their pad thai is good but a little on the dry side. $15 for a pad thai, with tax and tips, it will end up being $20, a bit pricy for the amount and quality of the food."}
{"text":"So glad that KSR is back in my life!  

This is a place that is always popular during the prime dinner hours so if you are arriving in a big group, please note that they won't seat you until the whole party is here.  Seating is at a premium here as the restaurant seating area is a long a narrow L shape corner of the building.  

if you do have to wait, up the stairs is a separate resto-bar where you can have a drink and chill while waiting for the rest of your part to arrive.

This was the perfect dinner spot for us to enjoy a excellent meal that is quick before hot-footing it back over to the Princes of Wales theatre to enjoy The Book of Mormon.

I went for my favourite item on the menu which is the khao soi.  Thick yellow creamy curry laced with noodles, chicken and the crunchy bits on top.  I wanted to try to the thai spicy but they recommended to get the regular and they would put some of the thai chili sauce on the side.  Then I could just adjust the spiciness as I go.  THAT WAS A GREAT RECOMMENDATION  because the chili sauce is explosive!  I don't know if I will ever be ready for thai spicy in this lifetime.

I also got a glass of Thai ice tea which was sweet and mild and thoroughly enjoyed it too.

The food always looks that it is made with care and the service is really fast.  Great combination!  The wall of eclectic tiles is certainly a conversation piece and I really like the vibe it adds to the whole place.

All in al, I am really glad KSR is back and can't wait to go again at the next opportunity. :-)"}
{"text":"So impressed with this place! Stopped in with the girls from work for a quick lunch. The food was amazing, could not be happier! The only heads up is they close between lunch and dinner. We just barely made it in time! (Lunch: 11:30-2:30)"}
{"text":"Went there on recommendation that the food was good. The hostess was absolutely cold when seating us. I asked to sit somewhere else and she was very annoyed by my request....in the empty restaurant. She said we could sit by the bar and then said something in her native language to the waitress. At that point two other waitresses looked at me...with no smile. That's when I refused to stay and eat there. The reception should be welcoming and friendly to get a good review. Too bad I didn't get to taste the food as the service ruined the experience for me. First impression was shattered and I will not be going back. I ended up going to a local pub for lunch instead...should have went there in the first place as I received a warm welcome by the hostess and the waitress."}
{"text":"I really love Khao San Road. It turned me onto Thai food. Flavourful, spicy, and clean-tasting (my stomach can be sensitive). It's a smart restaurant ... they know they don't have the service to check your glasses, so they give you giant Cokes if you order them. I'm happy with that. It may not be the most elegant, but it's practical. Great casual place with excellent food. 

Thing is, the wait is just not cool. It's always there, apparently, and you can't rely on eating when you want to. My boyfriend and I would come here so much more often if it wasn't a crazy wait even in the middle of the week.

Go to Sukhothai instead. Even though it's run by the same people, the food is somehow just a little off ... the pad thai is a tad mushier, and less spicy. The wait for *food* can be too long (actually ... time for another review). But it's good enough and you almost never have to wait for a *table*, so it doesn't really matter in the end."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is arguably the best Thai restaurant in the GTA. I highly recommend the pad thai, khao soi, and the yellow curry.

The wait time is a hassle as dinner can get reach to 45 minutes to an hour's wait, but if you ask me, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Yummy.

Super hard to get in to, so we finally ended up going shortly after 9pm on a week day and were able to get in.

Food was delicious- it seemed like a more expensive, slightly better quality Pho Pasteur- BUT- Pho is much, much cheaper and open 24/7- so you have to weigh the pros and cons.

Think of it this way- if someone takes you on a date and they get you into Khao San Road- be eternally thankful and enjoy every minute of it.

Friendly service, too."}
{"text":"I brought a family of 9, and though it was a long 45-minute wait, I found the hostess and staff here to be very accommodating in terms of trying to seat us as quickly and close together as possible. 

The place is a hip little place that's got very nice decor, interesting choice in music, and a low rumble from the amount of people that was packed into the place while I was there. It seems like it's a very popular place--so much so that I never saw a shortage of politely impatient people starting down those that were lucky enough to have gotten a table. That's definitely something to keep in mind. If your stomach feels like it's about to start eating itself....I think it's best to save this place for another day. 

If you're curious about the food, then boy were we your perfect guinea pig family! We got:

Crispy Rice Salad--great texture (crispy as promised), lots of strong flavors, a little tart (which I loved, but my mom didn't exactly like)

Soup of the Day (Tom Yum)--predominant sour flavor (which I loved, but my mom--again--didn't like as much), herbacious, shrimp was cooked well, and perfectly seasoned. 

Bangkok-Style Pad Thai (pork)--the better of the two pad thai offerings. I definitely think you should get this with shrimp, though, after having shrimp in the other pad thai. It just fits so much better. 

Three Flavours Pad Thai (shrimp)--seemed just ok compared to the bangkok-style pad thai. It's not a bad dish, though. The waitress also said that as a Thai person, she preferred Bangkok-style

Kua Gling (beef)--very strong flavors, the curry is punchy and exactly what you'd expect. The kaffir lime flavor made it very complex as a dish as it provided just enough acidity. 

Khao Soi (chicken)--kinda too much of the salty-sweet, to be honest, but was creamy and rich. If it wasn't so sweet and so salty, I could've eaten much more. The contrast between the crunchy and 

Massaman Curry--pretty salty without the rice, but goes a long way when you also get rice. I don't know what the arrangement for the rice was (aka whether or not it was included), but my family decided to get it and it was great with it. 

The total averaged out to be about $16/person. If we had each gotten our own dish, it would've been more expensive but also unnecessary. We got 7 dishes--one being a small bowl of soup and another being an appetizer--and were fine. Plus, I think if we had gotten one dish each we would've starved waiting for our food. Overall, I would return to this place, but not with a large group."}
{"text":"This places serves pretty good Thai food, I dunno if it's the best as others claim it to be but to each their Thai own. 

Venue is pretty small, VERY busy during lunch hours, come by a bit past dinner time on a rainy day if you want the restaurant to be all yours. 

Service is pretty quick, almost seems like they rush you (but that seems to be common in every Asian restaurant, lord knows why) 

The menu is short and small, I personally think these types of restos are the best because the put all of there focus on 15 main dishes instead of 50 like other places and skip out on their wine if you can, not the best options, save your $$. 

Food tasted great, very filling with lots of fresh ingredients and flavours. We ordered only 2 mains and shared because portions are pretty big if you aren't that starved. 

Dinner: 
Pad Thai Sam Roas aka 3 Flavours Pad Thai ($15) which was rice noodles, tamarind, egg, tofu, bean sprout, fresh roasted peanuts, shallot, chive, dried chili, lime and long leaf cilantro. 
Khao Pad Gaeng Kaew Wan aka Green Curry Fried Rice w/ Beef ($15) which was green curry, rice, bamboo shoot, green bell pepper, thai basil and fish sauce. 

This place is a great dinner option, it's tasty food, big portions and won't hurt the wallet, get take out if you are on a date tho haha it's not the best dining experience, those awful seats :("}
{"text":"Went a few days ago with a friend. Ordered the papaya salad that was delicious, the Pad see ew, which was also delicious and the Kua kling which was just ok. I made the mistake of ordering a higher level of spice than I could tolerate. Since my eyes were tearing and my mouth was burning despite finishing a beer in a few mins, we asked our waitress if she could help me and although I would have preferred to have another dish (I was about a third done and didn't like it as much), she managed to get me more rice to tone down the spice level, which I was grateful for.

The one disturbing thing I found was that as I was entering the washroom, one of the waitresses was exiting one of the stalls and left without washing her hands (and she flushed...). I then saw her organizing the cutlery by the kitchen door... I didn't say anything because we were running late to an event, but I found it disgusting and unfortunate.

Update - Jan 2014: During the holidays I received the following message from the restaurant:

\"Thank you for your feedback. Proper hygiene is of utmost importance to us, and all our employees take pride in maintaining sanitary practices. Employees are directed to use the communal hand washing sinks located outside the washroom entrances to ensure our facilities in our washroom remain as available as possible for customers. 

To help avoid future confusion, we have posted signs to clarify that we have additional sinks outside the washrooms. We appreciate your feedback and we hope this provides clarification regarding your concern.

we cannot seem to post a public reply, but we were hoping you would be kind enough to amend your original posting so others will be aware of our washroom setup.\"

I hope this is true, although it's the first restaurant I hear where employees are asked to wash their hands outside exclusively. I've heard of places where they're asked to wash their hands in a specific location, but not instead of washing them in the washroom. Employees are still touching things on the way from the washroom to the specific location where they need to wash their hands. However, I acknowledge it's better than employees not washing their hands at all."}
{"text":"Best pad thai I've had in my life.  I've tried many of their other dishes as well, everything tasted like home cooking.  Second best Thai place outside of Thailand I've had so far, next to SriPraPhai in NYC."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed with my whole experience at Khao San Road.  It is a super hipster/trendy place and I really didn't think the atmosphere, food, or service were very good.

My displeasure started from the minute my girlfriend and I walked in.  The place was incredibly crowded and the area to wait for tables was just not big enough.  Of the people who were sitting there we were maybe third in line for a table.  This wouldn't have been a problem because waiting for a table is no big deal, but then we got some interesting news.  It turns out you can put your name down for a table and then just leave and they'll call you to let you know your table is ready.  This is a good idea in theory, but when you have people waiting pretty much out the door, maybe it's not smart to make those people wait 30 extra minutes while other people come from wherever they're at and there are open tables.

Finally we got a table - they have tables for groups who come together as well as tables where they put you with random people, we ended up at a table for the two of us - and ordered the panang curry, pad thai, and a couple of cokes.  We could actually see our sodas sitting on the bar for about 10 minutes before my girlfriend finally just went up and grabbed them.  It was pretty funny to watch but I would rather them just bring me what I ask for.  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time though.  The pad thai was probably better than I've had it anywhere else but the panang curry was terrible.  On the menu they say it is \"dryer than other curries but more fragrant in taste\" (whatever that means).  If by dry they mean oily, I would wholeheartedly agree and besides that I found it particularly tasteless.

This place will definitely be left out of my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this spot.  

This was reaffirmed today at lunch.  Friday's they have my favorite curry as the special and it was perfect. They have spice that is flavorful and not just heat for the sake of heat. Everything is always fresh and tasty.  My dining partner had the pad Thai as he's a huge fan of that dish.  He was blown away by the quality.  

This place is perfect for first time Thai eaters, picky foodies or authentic Thai seekers.   

Awesome spot.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been amazing except the Thai Iced Tea. Maybe it was just that one batch. Gaeng Massaman is a must try. The flavors are incredible. Wish the wait wasn't so long, but I guess the word is out. Khao San rocks."}
{"text":"Always a great staple for those in the Entertainment District. Every dish bursts with flavour! 

The only drawback is how busy this place gets within 30 minutes of opening its doors for lunch or dinner. Get there early or expect to wait around. Even take-out can be 30+ minutes to get your order. It is worth the wait if you have the time, though.

Portion sizes used to be a bit bigger and prices have gone up slightly since they opened several years ago, but there isn't a better alternative in the area.

Must haves: the Bangkok-Style Pad Thai or Three Flavours Pad Thai, Pa Gra Prao (Beef), and start it off with the Tom Yum soup if that is the soup of the day.

Why 4 Stars? The long wait times to get seated and the smaller portion size to price ratio compared to the good ol' days knock off a star. When it first opened, this was a clear 5-star winner. Their success is so good that they really should expand to a larger space, while still staying in the area."}
{"text":"I think Khao San Road (KSR) used to be the defacto Thai place to go but I feel like the quality may have gone done. Either that OR restaurants like SukhoThai have upped their came. Since the finally reopened after closing for a year it just doesn't seem like they're back. 

In terms of service, took a long time for server to
Approach is for drinks. But I wouldn't come back,
I'd probably stick with Pai Or the one at Bloor and Yonge."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Thai food that happened to be within a 45 second walk from my hotel.  Seemed to be a trendy spot, as it was packed on a rainy, Tuesday night.  I ordered the Panang curry, which, as the menu aptly describes, was drier than what I'm used to (and what I prefer).  I guess I failed to realize that \"drier\" referred to \"less sauce\", and I probably would not have ordered it if I knew that.  Other than that, the flavors were good for the Panang.  I also had a the soup of the day, which happened to be a Chicken Coconut Curry--but I think they forgot to put the chicken in it.  I also ordered some Thai Iced Tea, which was good, although it was OUTRAGEOUSLY over priced--I was expecting something really special for $4.50!!!

Overall, seemed like a good place to take a date, but, to me, it was nothing more than your typical Thai takeout fare."}
{"text":"The food here is okay - not exceptional but I enjoyed the eclectic decor. This place gets jampacked very quickly and it is hard to seat large groups. We got there by 4.30 pm for the 5 o clock opening and were still standing in line. 

I had the Pad Gra Prao which was okay - the basil flavor was a bit too prominent and the chicken lacked some flavor. My brother got the Green Curry which wasn't great - a bit unimaginative and my cousin got the Khao Soi which was very interesting and full of flavor. I really liked the Khao Soi dish and my husband's Bangkok Style Pad Thai was incredibly flavorful and spicy and one of the better dishes of the night. Our appetizer of Fresh Rolls was quite disappointing. I noticed the Squash Fritters were being ordered by lots of people at the restaurant and that looked very interesting."}
{"text":"Oh Khao San Road! How I love thee. The fried squash? I dig it. The pad thai...either style? Dug that too. Everything you order at this place is awesome and totally worth the wait in the cold or the heat. Just stand there, get your belly all hungry and have at it when you sit down. 

Great...now I'm craving some Khao."}
{"text":"Just awesome. All around. Nuit and Jeff are great to deal with and deliver the best Khao Soi I've had since being in Chiang Mai! Have been a loyal customer since 2009, and proud of it!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious, as good as Thai food gets.  We ordered green curry (spice 3) and pad see-ew and both were well-prepared, and both were gluten free!  The only reason I withheld a star was due to the noisy atmosphere.  It was difficult to converse without yelling across the table. Prices were also very reasonable."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in the GTA. Have been going to this place for almost 6 years and nothing has changed about it. Still the great food and the great service. 

Highly recommend trying the Squash Fritters."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for Khao San Road! I would originally make a trip out to the dodgy mother restaurant Sukho Thai every so often but glad they opened one up on Adelaide, much closer to work and nice area. 

This is authentic Thai not the food court stuff, everything is awesome, but I always order the fritas, street pad thai and red curry!"}
{"text":"Food is Delicious. Drink options for non alcoholic is soso.

The wait in the cold sucks otherwise I would have given it a 5.  At least Starbucks was near by and they would call you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Their Squash Fritters. Best I ever had!
The place was cozy. Loved it. Will definitely visit again :)"}
{"text":"1/5 is my rating. 

People say that Khao San Road is one of the better places to eat in Toronto for Thai Food... 

HOWEVER, when your place has horrible customer service coming from, who seemingly is, the owner, I am not going to eat at your restaurant. If you are threatening to give away my seat when I have 19/20 of my people after I booked a reservation and your restaurant isn't even full, you're taking a 1/5 hands down. 

There are so many better places than KSR. I suggest Pai (https://www.yelp.com/biz/pai-northern-thai-kitchen-toronto-5); it's pretty close to them and their food + customer service is definitely better too. 

Yeah, I've been to a lot of restaurants and this is probably the WORST customer service ever. Especially when it's from the owner. 100% Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Considering the wait for this place... It's totally worth it. They even have benches on the side because they themselves know the wait is worth it! 
The only beer they have is yummy, the food is hella spicy!! And it's crowded and loud and not a place to come and chill because you see all the sad hungry faces in the window. 
Because of that, the food was served quickly and the beers were replenished almost before we had to ask. Friendly staff explained the spicy levels, which were very true. If you like it spicy but want to still enjoy your food, I would go with a 3. Anything higher than that and you're playing a game of risk! 
Had the egg curry with egg noodles, delicious. 
Also the pad Thai was really good too! 
Will be back to try more things, that menu must be explored!"}
{"text":"Oh have this place gone down hill right to pretentious-ville.  I used to come here often with Ravi soup next door 2-3years ago and returned recently with some friends and will not be going back.  I wonder if all that hype in the last couple of years had gone over their heads. People saying great reviews here are just drinking the kool-aid. It's a 1-star from me, which means AVOID!!

Food: 1/5, super pretentious in presentation and portions and I got sick immediately that evening.  I got the pad gra prao and it was literally stale white rice with fried egg and ground beef with just a spicy taste.  

Ambience: 1/5, super close seating just so they can maximize on patrons - a lot of people sharing tables and you have to scream to have a conversation: horrible choice for dinner. One of my friends was just sitting on a stool with the wall as the back.

Service: 1/5, because of small spaces, people are knocking you often and servers hitting you and stepping on your jackets etc. and it's one of those \"pay up front if you are paying with credit card\" places.  If you are going to be pretentious, have at least the service of taking your payments to the table instead of making your patrons move around a maze of small tables to get to the payment area and then fighting to pay your bills with those waiting for take-outs.

Price: 1/5, $18 for that!?!?! You can't charge that for whatever that was.  I'll rather go to ginger or salad King across the next block."}
{"text":"The food is so flavorful it's unreal. Definitely the best curry I've ever had anywhere. 

I had massaman curry which was a Friday special lunch and at $11.50 it was a steal. Service was attentive and fast. I liked the ambiance and super high ceilings and massive windows. 

This place gets busy really fast - for a good reason. My tip would be to come here right when they open if you want to have lunch. Otherwise you'll end up lining up."}
{"text":"Awesome thai food! Just follow what other yelpers are saying and you are guaranteed some taste bud explosives! Ate here on a tuesday evening, waited about 10 min for my table - which was not that bad. The place was tiny but super PACKED.

It was fun, the waitress was attentive, food was fabulous, decor was awesome, i had a great time. Def will come again. 

this is the type of place where i would lick the bowl.. and not be ashamed! 5 star indeed."}
{"text":"After all the hype, decided to check out Khao San Road for dinner.

On a Saturday around 6pm, wait time was an hour. But they will take your cell phone, so we wandered to nearby coffee shop and had a couple drinks while waiting. 

The restaurant is unassuming from the outside. Inside its busy! There is a hipster feel to it. We were seated at the bar. The menus are brief (I'm used to multiple options at a thai restaurant) with a few selections for pad thai, curry and house specialties. We went with the pad thai with shrimp. And then one of their specialty dishes the name of which escapes me. It was cream based with chicken and thick noodles.

Both dishes were amazing (shared between the two of us). The pad thai was well made and not too heavy. The other dish had amazing flavour and was REALLY filling. I could only eat half my portion (i.e., 1/4 the entire dish size) it was super creamy.

All in all a good experience. The food was excellent and well flavoured.  But I think I expected more options or more excitement to the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food the city has to offer and super friendly service to go with it. Be sure to get there early because they don't take reservations and they fill up quick. I'm slowly making my way through all the vegetarian friendly items on the menu and so far I haven't been disappointed!"}
{"text":"De-licious times infinity plus two!
Servers are friendly, food is amazing and the atmosphere reminded me a lot of the funky Thai places in Sydney AU.
We ordered the fried tofu (which both my friend and I have not stopped talking about), salad rolls, Green Curry tofu and the Tofu Pad Thai Sam Roas and was not disappointed. Side note -   I'm a spice fanatic and ordered my dishes extra hot with Thai hot on the side so if you love spice I recommend ordering Thai hot as I didn't find the extra hot that spicy.  Also be warned this place fills up FAST, it cost me three failed attempts (and a whole lot of heartbreak) until I finally caught on that busy hour starts at 6:30pm, so if you don't have a reservation I highly suggest showing up prior to 6:30 PM to snag a spot at the communal tables."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch and while it was very busy the wait for a table for two was not bad at all. The prices were a bit higher than I was hoping for on a \"lunch\" menu but I guess typical for a place downtown Toronto. 

I ordered their curry of the day with chicken which came with the \"average\" amount of spice and it was delicious! The food left me feeling satisfied - not too full. Our waiter was super cool and chill though. Perhaps my only qualm was the Akon album they had on repeat and how loud they played the music. Not a great place to have deep conversation while you eat!"}
{"text":"So following all the good reviews - I gave that place a try - and it was good.
I had their signature Khao Soi - which is noodles and beef in curry. I like the crisp factor, I do love their curry sauce (I am already a fan of good curries)...
One thing didnt enjoy in this dish, is the size of the beef pieces - too huge!!!"}
{"text":"This review is uber late, but I guess better than never. 

I went here in 2012 (somehow I still haven't managed to find time to go back) 

We ordered traditional bangkok style pad thai, pad see ew and khao soi noodles. 

Each dish was flavorful (comparable to dishes I've had in Thailand), meaning no ketchup found here. The khao soi noodles were surprisingly good, i'm not a fan of egg noodles. It was similar to the Khao Soi Noodles I had in Chiang Mai. The pad thai for me stole the show because it's a personal favorite and done well. Not sour at all until we squeezed the lime over, which is how it should be.

We sat at the bar until they had a table for us, it was way after lunch time and they were still packed. We got a nice bottle of white that was recommended to us by the bartender. 

Everyone was friendly and efficient. We were in and out within an hour. I heard they host an annual water fight party for Sokran, will have to try it next year!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Really tasty and authentic Thai dishes. If you decide to bring a big group for lunch, be sure to call ahead as its very busy at lunch hours.

Be sure to try their spicy curry noodle dishes as they are amazing. Would love to visit again if it was nearby."}
{"text":"Great food, ok atmosphere and good service. Food quality is pretty much the exact same as Pai, which is to say, excellent. However, I think portions, atmosphere and service is definitely better at Pai."}
{"text":"Best khao soi I've ever had! I don't have much of a spice tolerance so I ordered the mild. My friend wanted to get Thai spicy for her pad Thai but our server stressed how spicy it is and insisted she try the regular spice first. (But my friend said it wasn't thaat spicy.)

The wait on a Tuesday night at around 7PM was 45 minutes."}
{"text":"After riding bikes all around the waterfront my coworker and I made our way here for dinner. They were closing shop at 10pm and we made it there at 9:55, in time for last call! I ordered the pad see ew char kway teow noodles with prawns and my coworker had the chicken curry fried rice dish. Everything was made fresh, and cooked upon ordering so the dishes took awhile to be brought out. 

The portions here are meager, but that is probably for good reason. Good food doesn't need to come in large quantities to satisfy your hunger. I ordered my food at 3 stars for spicy-ness and found myself in need of a constant water supply. Fortunately there was someone there to refill my glass every time I thought my mouth was going to melt. 

The sign outside advertises free beer, but don't be misled - that is for the bar upstairs that is not affiliated with Khao San Road."}
{"text":"hands down the BEST, BEST, BEST Thai I've ever had on the North American continent. Flavors were light, clear, and crisp. I opted for a \"simpler\" lunch dish: the green curry with rice right before we embarked on our long journey back to NYC. Even the thai ice tea wasn't like the overly strong and sweet ones they serve down here. Food is NOT drenched in oil at all, which I loved. Being the first place we walked by on our first day in Toronto, I'm glad we saved the best for last. 

On our first day in Downtown, the Bf and I decided to explore the area and ended up walking by and noticing the long line outside Khao San Road. The nice guy taking down names was outside and was sweet enough to recommend great restaurants/food joints in the area for banh mi and other types of cuisines which completely guided us through our next few meals. Service in general is great."}
{"text":"I've been to the previous iteration of Khao San Road which was madly popular and wondered just what happened when I saw the reviews for this place. The verdict? I prefer this new Khao San Road which is just every bit as good as the original location!

I came here on a Saturday evening at around 7:30 and didn't even have wait at all. I was incredibly suprised. The old KSR had insane lineups and while I haven't been to Pai, I know there's crazy lineups there. To just be seated instantly is amazing. The interior here is pretty and I love how there's two floors here, giving some height and there's plenty of natural light coming in here.

I had the Khao soi and the Bangkok style pad Thai and both were absolutely delicious. While the Khao soi was good, I prefer their pad thai here. It was perfect. Their Khao soi was missing something.

We went with mild spicy to be safe but I didn't even taste any heat there, so medium/average is probably the way to go.

The service was friendly and extremely attentive. Water refilled frequently and we were checked on multiple times. Food came out quickly and it was just fault-less from start to finish."}
{"text":"Spiteful Host would not seat my party as 1 guest was outside. We politely asked to be seated and get some food going. He refused in a restaurant less than 1/3 full. As our colleague was on lengthy call we ask to be seated absent her. The host went out of his way to tell us he would not seat her with us under any circumstances, proceeds to seat us at a communal table then box us in so as no guest could slide down and make room for our colleague.

The host told us to tell everyone how they treat customers. So take note they can be hateful towards customers and you should know."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times, and there is always a long line of people waiting. They don't take reservations, so it's very frustrating when you have to spend at least 2 hours to wait in line and to wait for your food. I recommend going to Pai and Sukhothai for some equally great Thai food."}
{"text":"I am in Toronto for a conference and wanted an interesting place to eat.  Checked out Yelp reviews and picked this place, and it was a great choice.  I had the papaya salad and veggie and tofu pad see ew, both of which were very tasty.  Pad see we can be really sticky and heavy but the chef did a nice job making sure that the noodles did not clump together.  Everything was well seasoned and perfect.  Turned out to be a great choice, thanks to yelp."}
{"text":"The first time I was here it was pretty packed! We were told it would be a 30 min wait so we took a seat at the upstairs bar to wait. After almost an hour of waiting, we just decided to leave. 

Wanting to give this place another shot, we came right when it opened for dinner. We were seated immediately but it took a while for our server to get back to us! The couple beside us even came after we did and received their food first. 

The food itself was average. I love Thai and I've been to many Thai restaurants around the city and this really didn't do it for me. I did think the massaman curry was great. The different textures of the dish with the crunchy nuts, soft potatoes and tender chicken highlighted the flavours of the dish. However, the same could not be said about the Panang curry. The taste of the bell pepper was overpowering and left us disappointed. At a much higher price than many similar Thai places, it just did not feel worth it at all. 

Overall I'll have to give it a strong 2/5."}
{"text":"So good, but communal seating sometimes is a pain. I wish there was as bit more variety- a lot of the dishes taste very simular. I honestly prefer Pai down teh road- better atmosphere, less waits."}
{"text":"The first time I came to Khao San Road was about 5 years ago when they first opened up. I had to wait 2 hours just to get seated! Thankfully, this last time I was seated in a matter of minutes. I think being in a larger group of 6 helped this time around. You know what else being in large group helped? Getting all sorts of different things on the menu and not hating yourself after you're done eating! Honestly, if there was more of us I probably would have ordered the entire thing because everything looked delicious. 

To share we got the spicy beef salad, papaya salad, squash fritters, Bangkok pad thai, 3 flavours pad thai, khao soi, pad gra prao, and the tapioca pudding to finish. We also got the Thai bucket to share among the 6 of us as it had 5oz of liquor in it. 

Everything was delicious but what stood out the most to me was the pad gra prao. I'm a creature of habit so I usually order the same thing whenever I get takeout (i.e. khao soi) so it was rare of me to order something new. But I saw the people beside us chowing down and just had to get it and I am very glad I did. It was the perfect balance of salty and sweet mixed with the runny yolk of the egg. I'm practically drooling as I type this! I also ended up sprinkling some of the khao soi soup on top of the rice which added another depth of coconut/milky flavour to every bite. This dish is going on my favourites list! 

Another thing that I love about KSR is that the food is always consistently good. Admittedly I don't eat here every week like some but when I do get it, whether it's take out or eating in, I'm left more than satisfied with my meal."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes best thai food that I've had in Toronto. The green curry was perfect, and I loved that it included squash! It was really interesting and super tasty. The coconut shrimp was awesome. The menu is plentiful and I can't wait to go back to try more food!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, the manager served us actually.  Busy but quick to get us a table.  Get the Pad Thai, thai spicy, amazing!  But if you're with a group of friends just share and order different dishes because it's a shame not to try more than one!  Street style was also delicious.  Braised beef in one of our dishes was incredibly tender, and I am not always a meat eater.  Great for leftovers.  Got the shrimp chips to share as an appetizer, good big basket to share with a group.  Got the house beer.  A place with a small menu is usually a good sign- every item we had, they did it well!  Craving it regularly now!"}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favourite Thai restaurants of all time. It's busy all the time, but even if you have to wait a bit, it's worth it. I've been on multiple occasions now and tried different dishes and I've never been let down by the food. Be warned that when they say spicy, they mean it though!"}
{"text":"Actual conversation upon arriving at 8:45pm, they close at 10pm, there were 2 open tables for two with a party of 4 and a party of 2 in line in front of us, and lots of people finishing up their food.

me: \"hello a party of 2 please\"
rude-ass host \"ummm...yeah, um... you're ......maybe at this point\"

huh? wtf?  clearly i'm supposed to feel privileged for the honor of paying top dollar for tiny servings of generic thai food after arriving over an hour before they close. this place is making WAYYY too much money off of suckers willing to put up with rude service, so much money that they apparently need to close their doors at 9:59.  I bet if we had been seated they would have started kicking people out, turned up the lights at 9:45.  I wanted to tell the rude bastard that he could stick his ummm yeah maybe up his arrogant ass but my friend was starving and didn't mind the rude jerkoff host.  so he asked if we could order food to go and the rude ass host said \"maybe, you'll have to go down to the end of the bar and ask the..[rude ass frowning bitch]...waitress if they can take a to go order\".  Ummmm, okay, this is the second time i would have walked out but hungry friend wanted food.  broody impatient waitress took the order. we were ordered to go stand in a corner by the freezing cold door while we waited like beggars for the honor of being served by rude jerks.  several more people came in who were shocked to be told by rude snob host, um yeah you're a maybe as we close in an hour.  got food and left.  TINY portions.  yeah it was tasty enough in a generic way but damn, not even close to filling and i eat small dinners.  

if I wanted snobby rude arrogant service i'd go to NY.  this is canada where people are expected to be friendly.

you know rude jerkoff host (short-ish 5'6 white hipster dude with napolean complex working on friday 3/1), if you really can't seat people after 8:30 because you don't need anyone's business after 9:59pm on a Saturday night, maybe you could work on  a polite and somewhat apologetic schpeel to explain that, and then maybe those who arrive over an hour before you close just might return and not give you a 1 star review on yelp.  Take a look up and down the street - you have a LOT of competition and your food really isn't that special. and it is waay overpriced for tiny portions.  and servers - smiling and saying hello, please and thank you are part of your job."}
{"text":"The rice was nothing to write home about, neither was the customer service. But the curry was spectacular. Probably the best I have ever had....definitely worth the rude staff and meh rice."}
{"text":"Quality is what you're paying for when you come to Khao San Road. After only waiting for 20 minutes to get a table (come early, reservations are not taken), my girlfriend and I were seated at the bar. 

The bartender quickly acknowledged us and served some water. After a long musing, we went with the shrimp appetizer to start. Overall on the smaller portion but plenty of flavour. Would recommend and get again.

On to the mains - we both ordered the three flavours pad thai (one veggie and one chicken). The food came out in a reasonable amount of time despite it being a full house. Both dishes were fantastic. Whatever formula they have is spot on - you can taste the quality with each bite and you know that the food isn't topped with a lazy man's tamarind sauce. The chicken was plentiful and same with the veggies on my girlfriend's plate. 

Nothing else to really say other than what has been said below. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite thai restaurant in downtown Toronto. They have excellent taste and flavour. The food took a while to arrive but it was worth the wait. My favourite dish is the green curry fried rice and thai ice tea. We asked the server to make it thai spicy and it was delicious but maybe next time I will ask for a level less than the thai spicy. Kudos to them for having a special vegan menu. The prices here are little expensive maybe because of the location. I do recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to eat spicy vegan authentic thai food."}
{"text":"Very good yummy food.
Thai ice tea is very tasty, love it.
Tooooooo long waiting time, hate it.
A lot people, and not comparably enough waitress and waiters."}
{"text":"This is my fav Thai place in Toronto. I've been to Thailand quite a lot of times and I love Thai food - this is the closest I've been to Thai food out of Thailand. 

Their Pad Thai and Curries are awesome. They also have a Vegan Menu and quite good ambiance."}
{"text":"The food really is as good as it gets, seriously, I have yet to taste anything better. We got the squash fritters and khao soi, oh my gosh, it is a flavour explosion... seriously unreal. Okay yes there is a downside, you have to wait, for a long long time to be seated. Also, you may be seated with *gasp* strangers. Trust me, get over it because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the amazing this dishes and the food is worth the wait. The only problem is the extremely tight quarters and you feel you are sitting on top of other people. If you're looking for a serious convo or intimate date this is not ideal. The panang curry is my favorite but you can seriously check out any of the curries and you're in good hands."}
{"text":"Great spot for date night and we came after a spa day. Happening place with your typical downtown crowd and loud music. Service and food was good too. We had the Khao Soi and it was very delicious HOWEVER, having been to Lotus of Siam in LV, this place did not compare. The soup in the Khao Soi was very creamy and tasty, noodles were perfectly cooked and it was a fun vibe. The place is filled with 25+ something type crowd and great music.

Good thing I'm all about making reservations! Definitely do this or you'll be waiting a while and there isn't a great space for those who have to wait.

Personally, we've got some great Thai spots in Richmond Hill so I wouldn't make the trek for this place again. If you're in the area though and looking for a trendy spot with Thai food, this is the place.

Enjoy and remember to make reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"Toronto's BEST pad thai is cooked here! Although it is not on the menu anymore, you can still order the street style pad thai. The bangkok-style pad thai is very similar so it is just as delicious! I would not go anywhere else for pad thai since this has been the best I have found!"}
{"text":"The food is one of the better Thai places, but the service was not good.  Be prepared for a long line and slow service.  

The last time I went, we ordered then waited almost 30 minutes before our food came, and only one of orders came.  Our server had to re-order my friend's, and even though the Owner apologized, they did not offer to make it up to us (we only shared an iced drink, and it would have been nice if that was on the house)."}
{"text":"Food is sub par - some dishes extremely fishy. 

Absolutely terrible customer service. Never once have they gotten even one order right. No peanuts because of an allergy & it will always have peanuts. 

I work around the corner from this place and is never eat here again if you paid me. Nuff said ;)"}
{"text":"This relocated venue doesn't have a clear store signage but if you can fine the number 11 then you've arrived at Khao San Road! The venue seems small at a first glance but it's a L shaped space so it's quite spacious than you think. I love the decorative mosaic wall tiles and the thai flags hung on the ceiling. 

I've always had the Pad Kee Mao and it was great, medium spice is perfect and they actually put chopped up hot peppers in it which gives it a nice kick. I highly recommend it with chicken and also their green curry is my other go to! The place is still limited with seating but other then that it's a great place to dine in for Thai food."}
{"text":"From the moment we arrived, we noticed how un-attentive the servers were. Throughout, we had the feeling that the restaurant tried to serve too many people too quickly, which meant a sacrifice in service levels. This was a shame because the food was honestly amazing! We would go back, but for the food, not the service, and we'd probably get take-out instead of dining in."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for lunch but i kinda love it...

Street style pad Thai yum! I'm a sucker for simple foods done well and although pad thai's mix of sweet, sour, salty, spicy isn't exactly simple, it's done to perfection. I also kinda love that they give you chicken and tofu in the non-veg version. Carnivores can love tofu too!

I've also had the braised beef curry with noodles, Khao Soi, and it was delicious! The beef was so tender, practically falling apart and the curry sauce was delicious though maybe a bit too much sauce. 

Ideally I wish you could get a curry with a side of pad Thai because I'm greedy like that.... I want it all!

Oh and i have yet to try the minced pork with Thai basil and fried egg (Pad Gra Prao), but it's my all time favorite thai dish so I'm sure there will be an update to this review soon.

Quick update: I tried the chicken with thai basil and fried egg (Pad Gra Prao) and it was all I could hope for and more! I was sharing with a friend who couldn't eat pork so we opted for the chicken and I'd say it's better than the pork version I've had at other thai places. It's also a perfect dish to accompany the braised beef curry with noodles dish I mention above, the Khao Soi.

My latest meal has upped my original rating from 4 stars to 5!"}
{"text":"Just finished lunch at this cool little place. Parking wasnt easy on a friday afternoon. It was surprisingly busy when we arrived but waited a mere 5 min for a table for two. Our order was take quickly and the food followed. We got the rolls as an app. They were very fresh and tasty. The lunch portio curry was rich and the minced meat dish was full of flavor. If u like spice, this is the dish. Overall, this place hits the mark on price, flavor and coolness. However, on the downside, it was extremely loud. A good place for a small group of friends."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after hearing so much about it from friends. Really good! Service was on par and they have the best Thai beer. We had green and peanut curry. We liked green the best, peanut could do with more sauce but was so good it didn't matter as much. We usually go to coco rice and I would say they are definitely on par, but you don't want to sit down at coco rice and here you can. They do need to get delivery though."}
{"text":"I wouldn't want anyone to be fooled by the speakeasy edifice or the hipster decor.  I am a legit connoisseur or Thai food and this is a legit Thai restaurant.  The flavours are intense and complex, the spice is delicate but powerful, the service was excellent and the portions were proper.  My only hesitation in recommending this spot is that I don't want it to start getting too busy to seat me on the fly.  Already starting to get there! 10/10"}
{"text":"My dearest Khao San Road..... What an experience, first and foremost I almost walked by this place without noticing, cause the sign was so tiny and the font was kinda hard to read. But figured it was it! 

I would like to applaud this restaurant for having their very own vegan menu. I ordered the three flavour pad Thai with medium spice, and my oh my was it spicy. I would suggest to reconsider the level of spice you THINK you can handle, cause their medium average actually started to burn my insides and made my meal not so enjoyable. 

My overall experience was unforgettable because we shared a big table next to the patio with three other parties of complete strangers, while I was trying to handle the spice from my meal and the humidity of the 30 degree weather. I was not looking so good. On the plus side my food was great, the service was quick and I like the music they played. I would go back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Holy cow!  The food is amazing here. The most authentic Thai food in the city. I've eaten most dishes on the menu and can't seem to pick my favorite since they are all awesome. Can't seem to go wrong. I like the busy loud atmosphere that reminds me of the street in Bangkok that this place is named after.  The service is really good. Fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Had the fresh rolls and pad see ew... I wasn't feeling the roles but loved the pad see ew.   Place gets pretty busy so either go right when it opens like us or expect a bit of a wait.

I'll probably go back and check out other dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent as usual. Brought a date and we shared the Massaman curry with tofu (tangy, slightly spicy, lots of tamarind) and the ever-delicious Khao Soi (rich & cream curry heaven).

Saw a lot of people with Iced thai tea, which is a must-try next time in this weather!

Best time to go Sunday at 5pm when they open - little to no line ups!"}
{"text":"Really, really good Thai food. Agree with Ms. J that this is perhaps the best in Toronto. This was by far the best pad thai I have had in the city - very close (if not better!) to what you get in Thailand. All of the food was nicely spiced. Service was efficient and friendly. Would have potentially given it a 5, but my soup wasn't hot (temperature). Medium spicy  has a bit of kick, so don't go for \"hot\" unless you really dig the spices."}
{"text":"Must-have is their Thai Ice Tea, a real delight on your tastebuds and so damn refreshing. Order it and sit at the bar, you get a nice tall glass to go with their apps. 

Pad thai is very good but I felt it was slighty low on that tangy pad thai taste. Will try it again to make final decision.

Service is friendly and atmosphere is uplifting and active. Not a place for a quiet dinner. (went there monday evening: apparently their slowest night)"}
{"text":"Went on Monday night with friend around 8.00pm after swimming. We sat on a long table with other people. The restaurant was really loud but everyone seems really enjoyed talking and eating. I really love the atomsphere, this restaurant is a great chill out restaurant in summer! 

We had Mango juice, garlic shrimp, Green Curry and Pad Thai. Everything looks pretty good and tastes awesome! I will definitely go visit again this summer!"}
{"text":"Khao San Road is back! Congrats on their grand reopening of their new place now located on Charlotte street. The New restaurant looks amazing as it is now so much more spacious with two floors and also a bar upstairs.  Food as always is delish with all the favourite dishes on the menu. The bonus main dish per person for their grand opening was definitely generous on their part.  Thank you @khaosanroadto.  I had a great.time and is glad to have taken part in the charity raffle despite not being able to stay for long :)"}
{"text":"GREAT modern Thai place. I had the crispy rice salad and the Red Curry Thai dish with rice, delicious!"}
{"text":"So, let me say that I've been to thailand so I got ultra-cred in writing this review (puts on hipster glasses). Khao San road is a great place. Of course I didn't try everything on the menu but what I did have (papaya salad, veggie rolls, garlic tofu and tried a bit of pad thai) was very tasty. Spiced just right, great portion sizes, fresh ingredients. Perhaps a bit heavier than what I remember having in thailand, but I suppose we are back in north America and all that entails. Dinner on a wednesday was absolutely rammed, and the line leading almost out the door was a bit loud and distracting. Drink options were few (this actually reminded me a lot of thailand-trying to order a drink there was a bit painful at times haha). I would totally return for yummy food, as khao San road was a more than adequate solution for my thai cravings. The sheer busy-ness, lack of drinks and spartan table and seats would prevent it from being my very first choice though."}
{"text":"To top off the great food, and authentic thai taste, the owners are really phenomenol and creative people!! Glad they are doing well!!  They deserve the success!"}
{"text":"I've been here once, and I can tell you one thing: I'll be here again. The street style Pad Thai (the most basic thing on the menu) was sublime. It's so flavourful, it's cooked to perfection, and it doesn't put that big of a dent on the ol' wallet.

The restaurant itself is rather small, and you're at the wrong place if you want a good conversation or a private table, but trust me, it's forgivable given the quality of the food.

As an added bonus, they play some awesome music at this place! Totally forgot about \"Get Low\" by Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz, but it turns out that that song goes surprisingly well with Thai food. To the windowwwwwwww, to the wawllllllll!

Also, did I mention that the food is awesome? I did? Yeah, the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Bumping to 5 stars for consistent taste and service.
-----------------------------------
Went there again and I am bumping my ratings to 4 star.

The only thing i really dislike about the place is the cramped/loud environment. Everything else has been perfect.

I tried a few of their other menu items like Masaman Curry and Three flavours pad thai, and I don't think Thai food can get any better than this in Toronto. Their Spice level is ON POINT!

Get everything \"Extreme Spicy\" for maximum flavour, their is also a chef special spicy which is not written on the menu but they can make it for you.

Service has been pretty neat too, the wait time estimate they give you before you are seated is generally pretty accurate. They refill your water glass pretty regularly (we drink water like elephants) and the food comes to your table within a reasonable time as well."}
{"text":"Surprised this spot has such a low rating because it's my absolute favorite Thai restaurant. So much so that it is one of my first stops every time I visit home. 

They don't take reservations so there is always a 30 mins - 1 1/2 hour wait depending on the time and day you go, but it always soooooo worth it! My dad's signature dish is the khao soi and mine is the gad pra gao. He gets it thai spicy and i keep mine to a basic 3 which does the job. The thai spicy actually isnt TOO bad in the khao soi dish since its a coconut milk based dish so ends up running sweet. I would recommending the 6(thai spicy) if you're getting the khao soi and like it spicy."}
{"text":"A lot of people were telling me that I should try this place because I really enjoy Thai food. I've had much better. On top of that, the staff was very rude and rushed us. The restaurant was crammed and uncomfortable.

There are lots of better places."}
{"text":"So I went with the hype and checked this restaurant out...and I think I found my favourite. This place serves up MY kind of flavour. Kudos to the chef! For starters, we had the garlic shrimp (which was really good, you cant go wrong with anything fried with the right dipping sauce) and I got the red curry with chicken (spicy) with the thai iced tea while my spouse got the pad gra prao with a regular mango juice. 

Dude, everything was REALLY good. I swear. And this is coming from someone barely impressed by thai food so this was WORTH the long wait we had to endure in the cold when we got there. 30 minutes like you cant believe. We just stuck it out because we walked too far already and looking for another place was just too much of a bother. So probably call in to reserve or just line up early before they open. 

The staff was very attentive and as usual from the pictures this place is really busy ..so if your lucky, you can be one of those people who get seated right away.

Anyway, I cant wait to try some of their other stuff on their menu when I go back in the future. Am a repeat customer for sure."}
{"text":"I've bee here twice; both times have been great.  The green curry, omg.

Yes, you've usually got to wait; it's good enough to stick around for."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Thai restaurants I've been to outside of Thailand.  The red curry was BANGING... I could drink this curry through a straw.  I had the Pad Thai because of the great reviews and it was not disappointing.  If I lived in Toronto, I'd probably go here at least once a week.  Long wait for dinner, but definitely worth it.

Btw, who closes at 10 pm on a Saturday night?!  They should definitely rethink this."}
{"text":"I would have to say the best Thai food in Toronto.  The seating is very limited and you will most likely be sitting at a table right next to a stranger but it is all worth it.  Did I mention that the minimum wait time is 1 hour.  But hands down the best Thai food we have ever eaten at in Toronto."}
{"text":"We ended up lucky and our 1 hour wait turned into being only 20 minutes. The place is small but comfortable. Service is extremely quick and friendly, no matter how busy they are! 

We've shared squash fritters and they were divine! The peanutty-sweet-sour concoction of a dipping sauce was mind-blowing! 

For the main I've ordered Khao Soi with beef! Just as expected, it was absolutely delicious! So much flavour, noodles cooked to perfection (both soft and crispy kinds)

My friends had pad thai and they raved about it too! Tip: Thai Spicy is extremely freaking spicy... beware! My friend who can never get her food spicy enough at other thai and indian places, could barely eat her food! (she still finished it because it was delicious but was on fire)

Will try their green curry next time!"}
{"text":"So for the past few months I have been asking local torontonians about where to have Thai food and without a doubt this place comes up as their first choice and so finally we made it!! Sunday night and there was a short wait which was fine and the staff was really nice, attentive & responsive. Had the shrimp Bangkok pad Thai and beef green curry. The food was definitely a 4*... I know you are thinking then why the moderate rating...

...well a couple of important reasons... First & for most is like to be physically comfortable when I am paying over $20 for a meal. We sat at the high top tables where we shared our space with 7 other people. Now if this was a pub or a club fine but it is not. Sitting on a stool at a tall picnic table is not my idea of a relaxing dinner. As well, I should have read one of the reviews regarding noise level...between the kitchen noise, music and people it was well as stated LOUD ...so much so that we could not speak.

All this to say there is a nice quiet star bucks just west where you can relax and have a hot chocolate."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch today at Khao San Road. Ordered the Khao Mun Gai Taud ($10), breaded fried chicken over Jasmine rice cooked with ginger, garlic and pandan. Very tasty. Also made it a combo ($3), small soup (Tom Kha Gai, chicken and coconut soup) with a summer roll, both were great. Thai ice tea ($4.50) was tasty as ever, but perhaps a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent service and outstanding food. I highly recommend it. This place has made me a fan of Thai food. This is one place I wish I could find at home in Miami."}
{"text":"my bestie took me here when I visited her at work and we went out for lunch. she wouldn't stop raving about this place and it came down to either khao san road or some sushi place. I caved and tried this thai joint.
the interior was pretty nice and hipster-esque enough but wayyyy too crowded and you can't hear anything other than a bumble of noise from other people all trying to talk over each other.. 
but someone please tell me how it's been over 6 months since I've been and I couldn't stop thinking about the food since the day I left. I'm bombarded with work so I can't go back for another while longer but I had the Khao Soi and it was literally the best thai food I've ever had! 
I can't go into detail about how amazing it is because I suck at explaining things (starting to wonder why I got yelp...) but yeah.. this place is amazing despite the line and noise"}
{"text":"In Toronto for a weekend, and my friend and I were looking up dinner places near our Airbnb. Khao San Road popped up, and as we had only an hour before our comedy show, we opted for take out (as the wait to sit down was half an hour!). It's a cute, but small place. I ordered the beef pad see ew, which was really good. It heated up really well too the next day. They ask what spice level you want, which I appreciated, since I'm not a fan of spicy food. 

If i'm ever in Toronto, in the area again, I'll definitely stop by here for my Thai fix!"}
{"text":"After researching about this place me and my husband went to this place last week. Worst service ever experienced in Toronto restaurants. Server didn't allow me to sit because my husband went to park and there is a policy for them to sit only full parties BUT at the time the restaurant is still really empty(just open) and no line up! It ruins the night. Server seems doesn't care that much given that the place is always full. Sharing of the table makes the experience really bad. We usually order a lot of food and wanted to sit at the corner of the sharing table but the server didn't allow that as well saying it's reserved for three people party. All was ok if the server's attitude was better but we seemed not cared much at the place. So disappointed. Not a restaurant really just as the name suggests street foods with ok food but bad service and ambiance. The food was ok but definitely you could find better thai food elsewhere. Curry too greasy with a bowl of oil which makes it undrinkable."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is an actual road in Bangkok that is packed with cheap bars and restaurants. The food here was really authentic, I felt as if I was eating delicious food in Bangkok.
Sadly, there was a gigantic live fly in my food, so I am taking away one star for that. It was HUGE and started walking all over my rice. I was so horrified and felt to disgusted to eat anymore of my pad kra krow. The waiter took that dish off the bill. One thing to note is that you can order your food based on different spiciness level. There is even  an extra charge for the highest level of spice. You are also not allowed to return your food if its is too spicy. Therefore I would advice you to err on the side of caution.
For appetizers, I would recommend getting fresh rolls as well as the squash fritters. The squash fritters were seriously the bomb, they are shredded pieces of squash deep fried together. It was so unique and good. They also have coconut water as a beverage, unfortunately, it comes from a box, you will not a get a whole fresh coconut like you do in Thailand.
Khao San Road does not take reservations so make you might have to wait. We had a short wait, so we decided to check out graffiti alley!"}
{"text":"I've been here enough times now since my initial review that I can safely add back the fifth star that I failed reward to KSR with on my first visit.  The service, atmosphere and food is consistently good.  My favorite dish, the Khao Soi, has now been replaced by the Pad Gra Prao (with minced pork and fried egg) made THAI SPICY.  This mouth watering dish makes me want to go back to here every time I think about it.  In fact, I have to say, having left Toronto, KSR is one of the restaurants I most look forward to trying when I come back."}
{"text":"A true delectable gem for Thai food in Toronto, arguably one of the best if not the best, depending on who you speak to.

I've had the chance to taste their pad thai, their curries and as well as the Thai styled ice tea.  All very, very delicious!

The curries are of noteworthy mention and should be considered their signature dishes.  Sweet, fragrant, creamy, seasoned perfectly that delights the taste buds.   Curries are meant to entice the senses before you even taste it and their coconut milk based curries does just that when you smell it all in before taking that first sip.  I absolutely adore their green and red curry, with spice level 2 or 3.  Yes, you can adjust your spiciness level if you can't take the heat!

Definitely arrive early and be prepared to wait, as the restaurant is always full of hungry diners, but they do take your name and number should you find yourself wandering away while waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Seriously. I arrive a bit early to meet my friend for dinner and am looking forward to unwinding and having a drink before she arrives and I am told that I can't be seated until my friend arrives as they only seat 'full parties'. There are TWO of us!!! I get it with a table of 8-10+ but 2 people!! To boot, the joint is EMPTY!!!!!

Standing on the sidewalk outside of an EMPTY restaurant I was NOT impressed! When did people begin thinking that bad service equals prestige? 

As my friend picked the place so we stayed and I did my best to hide my overall annoyance. They made a pretty big deal about the seating, telling us we either had to sit in the centre of 2 larger groups in a shared table (you couldn't even tell there were spots there the table was so crowded) or we could wait 15-20 minutes for another seat. Now, although there were some people there by then it was still half empty. My annoyance broke through and I think the guy realized it and then offered a seat at the end of a long empty table. I should point out that although this was a table for 8 people we were the only ones sitting there throughout our meal. Why were we going to have to wait 15-20 minutes??? UGH!

Anyway, the food was pretty good. I had the Chef's Special Pad Tai and Fried Tofu. The tofu was particularly good, not greasy, firm and tasty. I tried the tai iced tea, which I had never had before and won't again. I don't know if it was 'good' or not but it tasted like eagle brand milk with mango juice. Not my thing. My friend had a beef curry which she enjoyed and a friend veggie plate. Overall, good food but I am not likely to return due to the pretentiousness."}
{"text":"Had an amazing meal here tonight.  This place knows how to do Thai better than any place in the city - hands down.  Their chef special pad thai is amazing.  None of the ruby red, ketchup-laced stuff that most Thai places serve.  The noodles had the perfect chew and the flavours were spot on.  We had it with shrimp for $1 more and they were succulent and full flavoured. 

The squash fritters also blew our minds.  They were squash patties wrapped in noodle-like strips of batter then fried and served with this kick-a** peanut and tamarind sauce.  5-star dish for sure.  Also try their Thai ice tea - it's a concoction of  full-body black tea with condensed milk. 

Only negatives was this place lacked a strong enough air conditioner to cool the room, it's too small so the lines are long and the portions are a tad smaller than I would have liked."}
{"text":"I stopped by on a Monday after seeing they were the hottest place on yelp. I like the vibe of the place.  The communal table feel was cool.  I ended up seated at the bar and kind of felt like a leper though. There was a lot of traffic behind me and no bartender to entertain me - only staff filling water pitchers. Food was pretty good.  Started with the squash fritters.  Massive pile with great taste.  Then massaman curry.  I probably made a mistake by asking for a mild version.  It really wasn't infused with any flavor. Ended up talking with one of the owners after dinner. Nice guy. Overall, I'd say try it."}
{"text":"Horrible experience trying to line up. 
I put my name down at approximately 6:30pm, waited for about 30 minutes and had to leave and find another parking spot with a better rate since it looked like we were gonna wait for a long time.
After another 30 minutes, I was so hungry I left and went to another restaurant couple blocks down, had my meal, enjoyed a few drinks and completely forgot about Khao San Road.
To my surprise, they called at 9pm and asked if I still wanted to dine there. It was the most ridiculous wait ever, it took them almost 3 hours to seat me!"}
{"text":"Upon entering Khao San Road, I remember hearing the song \"you're not good enough\" by Blood Orange on the speakers. After waiting about 45 minutes to be seated (which is entirely OK so long as the food is outstanding), I realized that this song title ironically captured my sentiments towards this restaurant.

I ordered the three flavours pad thai, which was made with rice noodles, tamarind, egg, tofu, bean sprout, fresh roasted peanuts, shallot, garlic, chive, 
dried chili, and lime. While the dish itself was quite good and flavourful, the portion size was rather small for the price. Even though I'd normally give a plate of this calibre a 5-star rating, the long wait-time coupled with the portion size forced me to re-evaluate my opinion. 

Notwithstanding the criticisms on the ambiance of this restaurant, my friend and I actually well enjoyed Khao San Road's aesthetic and fresh take on Thai dining. This entertainment district gem is submerged in a cavalcade of modernist art, and is frequented by some of Toronto's biggest foodies.

Some friendly tips: stop by Khao San Road at least 45 min to an hour before you're ready to eat your dinner. Make sure it's quite nice outside, as you would probably prefer to walk around the Entertainment District or Chinatown whilst waiting to be seated. When you're all set and comfy at your table, I'd recommend washing your meal down with some of their deliciously homemade coconut water."}
{"text":"It's fine but it's not worth all the hype and all the waiting in line. I much prefer Pai, just around the corner."}
{"text":"yeah, my experience here matched the yelp reviews. it's good, real good. the food, the vibe. 

PROTIP come at the end of the lunch shift if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"I went to Khao San Road twice while visiting Toronto as my hotel was right across the street. I would've given 2-3 stars after my first meal. I ordered the Khao Soi. It wasn't as good as the reviews indicate unfortunately. I felt it lacked flavor and was kind of oily. I also ordered the mango juice, which was tasty. Service was just OK the first time.  

I went back again another night to see if I would like another dish more. I got the Three Flavours Pad Thai. This dish was better than the Khao Soi but again, it wasn't great. I ordered it with Level 2 spiciness level (average) but I didn't taste any spice at all. Ordered a Thai Tea to wash it down. Can never go wrong with Thai Tea. What really stood out this time was the service. The waiter was nice and attentive and even hooked up the couple sitting at my table with a container of sauce to go because the guy really enjoyed it. So that was a nice thing to do. So I would give the second meal 4 stars.

All in all, I gave 3 stars because the food was just average, service was good, and I felt like the atmosphere could be improved with more of a Thai flavor. Clearly the locals love it as it's always packed. But I find it hard to believe this is the best Thai restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"line up to get a seat at this King West can be up to 1.5 hours but for good food at reasonable price, it's worth to try at least once."}
{"text":"Delicious! Really enjoyed the food here.

TIP: Definitely order the Thai Iced Tea. So good. It's a bit sweet, but you will not regret getting it.

Squash fritters were great. I've never had anything like them but I felt like the dipping sauce could have been a tiny bit spicier. 

My friend and I got the Bangkok style Pad Thai. The regular spicy level, which is 3 I think, was perfect for me. Just enough to add a good kick, but not mask the flavours of all of the spices and herbs in the dish. However, it became a bit too sweet after a while because everything else we ordered had a bit of sweetness to it. At that point, I feel like it would have been beneficial to have added one or two more wedges of lime on the side of the dish.

Overall the meal was great, but the food was a tad bit sweet for me. Will definitely return for the Thai Iced tea and Pad Thai though!"}
{"text":"I have asked people time and time again - what is so good about KSR?
people say it's authentic, it's different, it's good.... being the hottest restaurant on urban spoon, I had to try it myself.

For a thursday reservation, I had the option for 5 or 8... so I chose 8. Walking in on time, the place was bustling with people lining up along the little corridor by the doorway. There were two long sharable tables up top and a section of separate tables along the back.

The waitress was patient with us, even with all the other people placing their orders, or trying to make their way in. I ordered the Chai Nom Yen to drink - An infusion of Thai spices and black tea mixed with condensed milk.. aka thai iced tea. The black tea had definitely been steeped for a long time because it was a very dark colour, close to an orange. Being the thanksgiving season, you would've thought you were drinking a pumpkin shake. the drink was rich, tasted like a strong bubble tea and although mighty tasty, it was a huge cup. The condensed milk was definitely sweet, but I would suggest sharing, unless it is a super hot day and you take it to go - got to save room for the food!

We shared an appie of garlic shrimp, which was butterflied, pankoed and fried. Very tasty. For mains - the ever famous Sam Roas Pad Thai - i could taste the three flavours with every bite - it never went away and my tastebuds never got accustomed to one specific taste - it was fascinating! I had expected the sauce to be more wet as the textures were more dry, but I have nothing against it. This must be what everyone spoke about with its authenticity.

The Khao Soi with beef brisket was superb! I'm all about sauce and it is a rich, flavourful, curry that I wanted all to myself. The noodles were a great texture, the beef was so tender, and I wish there was a bigger bowl!

We got a curry - Gaeng Massaman with chicken, which consisted of tamarind sauce and cooked with onions, peanuts, potatoes and bay leaves; topped with crispy deep fried shallots. Yes the chicken was tender, but I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary..

Little did I know the reason we were sitting at the communal high tops is because the restaurant was not able to give us our table for our 8 oclock reservation. Because of this, we were given free dessert!!!! It was a little bowl of warm coconut sago - which I love. The only thing I would have preferred was that it was either super hot or super cold.. and it was in between.

Despite how crowded it was and the loudness of the place, the service was really good. the transition between appie to main course took a REALLY long time, so I can only hope that it doesn't always take that long. However, the food was delicious and full of unusual flavours and I will come back again for more!

make reservations!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't really know what the point of writing a review for this place is anymore. Do you guys actually care about my opinion??? It's amazing. The food is superb. 

The line up is huge. Put your name down, go to the bar next door and stfu and wait. It's worth it so don't complain. It's a night out after all...if you wanna stuff your face and go home then this isn't a place to be. Prepare for a total time spent of around 3-4 hours. To be fair, the wait at Guu is 2-2.5 hours on a Friday night too.

I went on a Thursday night, got there around 8 and the wait was 30min. Not bad at all so if you really don't wanna wait come on a week night. 

I had the Khao Sai. A bowl of chicken and noodles, in thick and creamy coconutty and spicy curry like sauce. I can't even. That is all. 

My partner in Khaorime (hehehe) had the pad thai. Simple and delicious, with chicken and some dehydrated shrimpies. Yum Yum.

We shared garlic tofu. I never knew how much I would love tofu....holy sh*t. It was aaaaaamazing. Shrimp is great and all but are you ready for fall head over feels in love with TOFU?!?!?! yeah. ponder that for a bit. 

It's fun and loud and you get to sit next to random strangers and make friends and yay!! Love it. Good prices too, nothing too expensive."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, however the small space (packed with people), lack of reservations, line ups, and the 1+ hour wait makes it not worth it. There are many other Thai options in the city that are comparably good without the negatives."}
{"text":"Delicious Curry. One of the best I've had. We ordered their green Curry and one of the rice dishes with ground beef.  Sorry I can't remember the names but you can find them on there. They were both delicious. We had to wait an hour before we could get a table. We just went to the arcade at the theatre nearby. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"Awesome food, very favorable, busy so you may have to share a table with a stranger or two, great lunch atmosphere and 80's tunes. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I love this place... 
I went with two others, had an appetizer, the squash fritters.
The Gaeng Curry with fish was delicious.  Way better than i expected.
The Bangkok-style Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp and the Pad Gra Prao with beef were really tasty."}
{"text":"I have not had excellent Thai since leaving Vancouver. This place is very special! I ordered the Chef Special (Pha Pho? I suck! I did not write it down) and my friend got the Thai Green Currry, She also gave it her thumbs up of approval.

If anything, I would order my dish spicy next time!"}
{"text":"So today I had the most delicious Thai dish I have tasted. The Kai Sao was out of this world.    Th beef in it tastes like slow roasted brisket enveloped in the most well balanced carefully crafted golden lava sauce.   Add in both crisply noodles for texture and the soft noodles for depth and you are left with something that is simply beyond description. 

The ambiance is cool.  Feels as close as being in Thailand as you will get in Toronto.  The garlic tofu was on point and we also tried the chicken Sao pro pe.  It was delicious but what this place is known for is out of this world.  

Go there.  Go the now!"}
{"text":"Tasty and not too hard on the wallet! Personal favourites include the squash fritters, khao soi, and pad see euw (spelling?).  Everything is flavourful and mixes a wonderful variety of spices together to give their dishes some real oomph! 

They don't take reservations though so be warned! Line is always ridiculously long and starts as soon as they open! Better for duos or small groups."}
{"text":"The place was packed. We were told we had to wait 20 minutes but I think we waited longer than that. Had the Chicken Pad Thai and my friend had Green Curry Chicken. They were both awesome. I can't explain it but my Pad Thai tasted like it has been made from scratch. It didn't taste like it was made using instant mix (don't ask how I figured this out). It definitely was worth the wait. Also, the place was crowded on a Tuesday around 6pm. They have 3 huge picnic tables in the front part of the restaurant that can each sit 10 people. And if you don't have 10 people in your party, you sit with other people at the table. So if you like privacy while you eat, this is not the place for you. It didn't bother me. There are smaller tables in the back part of the restaurant also. I imagine you don't have to share the table with other people in that area. Also, the place is noisy due to many people being there. It didn't bother me either."}
{"text":"Khao San Road has become favourite Thai Restaurant in Toronto. Although they do not have home-cooking style dishes that I'm used to such as sticky rice, papaya salad, etc., they are amazing at making the dishes that they do have on their menu.

I ordered Khao Soi my first time and it was super delicious. I chose Thai spicy since I can usually handle spiciness and it was almost too spicy - so beware! I had the Chef's Special Pad Thai the second time and it is probably the best Pad Thai that I've ever had.
 
On our first trip to Khao San Road, the owner came and asked my friend and I how our meals were after we finished our meals, which I thought was very courteous of him to do. 

My friend and I had such a good experience our first time at this restaurant that we came back a few weeks later and brought another friend. My parents are pretty critical of Thai food from restaurants, and I can't wait to bring my parents to this place. 

Yes, it's that good!"}
{"text":"Um...what does one do or how does one rate a restaurant when there is HAIR in one's green curry at lunch time yesterday?  Yeah, exactly.  1 star is being generous!
It started out alright with getting seated rather quickly and then ordering the lunch with the combo of soup and spring roll.  That soup was spicier than anticipated -- holy moly!  And I'm Korean -- kimchi is in my veins, my blood, but I found the soup unevenly balanced with the spice and acidity in conflict.  The soft fresh roll was fine, just meh.  But when our entrees came -- my friend's green curry had a hair in it.  It wasn't her hair.  It was staring right at us on her plate, too.  The server quickly took it back to the kitchen and got her a fresh order.  I had the Pad Thai, and it was so overwhelmingly drowning in fish sauce and crispy fishy bits, it just wasn't very tasty.  It was completely unbalanced.  We were in and out of there in 30 minutes.  I can't recommend this place but do give them props for at least comping my friend's meal.  It was the least they could do."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great service and the food was delicious. The down fall is that there is always a line up, but it's worth the wait. So far my favourite Thai resto in Toronto."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food are ok but I will NOT go back here as their customer service sucks big time! Servers are rude especially that asian guy who told us to move to the other side of the table (we were only 3) because the side of the table we sat on was for 4 people but before seating on that table the other server told us that its ok to seat there so we did that but then few minutes later this rude server guy told us that we had to move. So annoying and rude. Never again Khao San Road."}
{"text":"I love this place and it is my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto right now. I've tried a few different dishes and none have disappointed. Their authentic thai iced tea is amazing too so make sure to grab that along with any spicy dishes."}
{"text":"My far the best Thai food in Toronto (this was confirmed by a friend who is Thai). Portions are smaller than what you'd get from a take-out/delivery Thai place, but ingredients are fresher. Come early or you'll end up waiting 45 minutes. You can have them call your cell when your table is ready, but you won't be seated unless the entire party is present. Slightly frustrating that they don't take reservations and are closed on Sundays, so the fact that I'm giving 5 stars is indication enough that the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Been here many times and honestly it's one of the best places in Toronto to get some delicious tasting Thai food. 

The line-ups are terribly long during dinner time and you can expect to end up waiting for about half an hour up to two hours (depending on how big your group is) just to get seats. Try going during lunch time, where it isn't as busy but still expect to wait for a bit before getting seated, it's just not as crazy as the wait times during the dinner hours.

The lunch menu is exactly the same or similiar as the dinner menu but nevertheless their menu has quite the variety of dishes to try from.

Inside the restaurant is very loud and a jumble of conversations can be heard throughout the entire restaurant but that's because of the low ceilings. Personally, I like that rowdy and loudness because it makes the experience and atmosphere more enjoyable. Great place to bring a group of friends to kick back, eat, laugh and enjoy some good food.

Now onwards to their food-- ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

People who love sweet drinks or iced tea just have to get the Thai Iced Tea that they serve up in this lovely restaurant. The iced tea is incredibly creamy and sweet, just my kind of drink. $4.50 for this drink is a little bit steep because the cup is mostly just ice but it'd be so worth it if they cut down the amount of ice that they put into the cup by half.

Their Pad Thai is honestly one of the best tasting pad thais that I've ever had. Incredibly flavourful and it packs a punch. The portion of this dish was reasonable and the balance of noodles to meat and veggies was good. Definitely worth the money.

The Khao Soi...is so good. Easily one of the best dishes on their menu. The crispy noodles they put on top is done right, crunchy and light which compliments with the delicious yellow curry goodness underneath. Super super flavourful and creamy. The thickness of the curry was just right. Not too runny and not too thick, just how I like my curries. The meat inside the curry is also cooked to perfection. Overall, it was just so damn delicious and it makes my mouth water just thinking about it.

Their curry of the day is also delicious too if you want a quick fix! The portion is quite small but the flavours and the creaminess of the curry definitely makes up for that.

If you are adventuring to find the best place for thai food, don't be hesitant and definitely give Khao San Road a try! You won't regret it. Just get past the long wait times for a table and you'll be in for a wonderful time of enjoying good tasting Thai food."}
{"text":"A pretty authentic Thai food restaurant.  The best part was they offered my favorite Thai dessert, Sa Koo Ma Prao, tapioca pearls in coconut milk, which is never available anywhere else!  We each got a cup.

We also got their Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) which was good and also Khao Soi (egg noodles in coconut milk with curry).  A cool, modern ambience with metal chairs and an open ambience."}
{"text":"Khao soi all day errrrday. That's how good it is! The pad Thai was very good - quite unlike other Toronto offerings which veer on the side of too sweet, salty or eggy."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai in Toronto. I always get the Khao Soi which is excellent every time. The only problem is that they don't accept reservations and trying to get a place to eat is IMPOSSIBLE. I've always had to wait for over an hour to get a table and when you're with people that aren't as much into food as you, it often becomes a bit difficult to justify the wait outside."}
{"text":"My friend took me here because I've always loved Hong Kong style milk tea and he said the Thai iced tea was \"godly good\". I did like the drink but probably because there was so much hype about it, I expected something more amazing haha 
But don't get me wrong, it was a really yummy drink! It had a roasted flavour to it! :)

Even though we waited for 30-45 minutes for a table, the food made up for it. I'd recommend the green curry chicken and the Thai iced tea of course!

It was pretty crowded when I went, but the noise level wasn't too bad. The service could be better. It took us a while to get our server's attention but she wasn't exactly busy either.. :S"}
{"text":"Went here Friday night and it wasn't too busy yet. The entrance is a bit hard to find because there is no sign on the front door. I'm assuming they're still putting it up because they just opened. 

The menu was pretty much exactly like Sukho Thai, maybe a bit more expensive. We had the squash fritters, khao soi, Massaman curry, and thai ice tea. All were delicious and the quality was exactly like Sukho Thai. Staff were friendly, gave us great recommendations, and was attentive throughout the evening. 

The location is right downtown and is quite easy to get to. We will definitely be back. I hear they do delivery too. 

(p.s. minus one star for limited dessert selection and hard to find entrance)"}
{"text":"A bit overrated. Thought the food was okay. Servers were really nice and helpful. Good place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"I generally think it's bad form to write a review about a place you've only been to once. That said, holy shit this Pad Thai i'm eating right now is un-fucking-believable. It's making me believe in God. I got a hot, which is also pretty damn hot. (So don't get the hot unless you enjoy very hot food.)

You need to eat here. Stop whatever it you're doing and go now. (Be prepared for a bit of a wait.)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Friday, was packed!
The waiter was very friendly, ordered the pad thai sam roas & it took forever to come. The pad thai was very average, don't know what the hype over this restaurant is about."}
{"text":"Went there twice with my friends and usually it is packed which means over half an hour waiting but you could always stroll around Financial core or sit in coffee shops nearby until they call u when your seats are ready.
Love the Bangkok Style  Pad Thai, Green Curry and Mango juice best. 
I went for Thai Spicy which is scored 6 regarding spicy scale and waitress came to me asking whether I am fine with the spice as some ppl get burnt. Luckily, I survived with a happy full tummy.
Highly recommend downtown professions to go there after work!"}
{"text":"One has to try the Thai restaurant named after the street in Bangkok where all the white tourists go. 

The red curry was incredible. The Tom yum soup was super flavorful but a bit sweet. The fresh spring rolls were very good. Unfortunately, the pad thai was too sweet and a bit gummy. 

Be careful with the spice chart. It gets super spicy super fast! 

The service was great at the bar."}
{"text":"The hype is real. Usually I'm skeptical of restaurants that get blown up like this, but the hype is real. We came on a Friday night so naturally the place was packed, and ended up waiting around 30 minutes for a table for 2 - not bad for a Friday night, plus you can walk around while you wait and they'll call you when your table is ready.

We got two Thai iced teas, the three flavours pad thai w/ tofu, and the massaman curry w/ shrimp. I love all the different kinds of Asian milk teas and this was my first time trying the Thai version - definitely one of my favourites now. Both the pad thai and the curry were perfectly seasoned and well-balanced in terms of flavour; Thai curries often taste too sour for my liking but the massaman curry was actually super savoury and even a little creamy (the potato balls were also really cute, but that's beside the point). Another seemingly trivial detail: the broccoli in the pad thai was probably the best broccoli I've ever had; most of the time it's either flavourless or soaked in sauce, but these were perfect.

To be honest, I'm not even a huge fan of Thai food but this place has me sold. Looking forward to visiting them at their new location once they're settled in!"}
{"text":"VERY noisy. The music is WAY too loud.
Long wait outside. 
They're pushing people to order eat and get OUT fast ..... Rushed vibe. Manager came to take our food order before our drink order ..."}
{"text":"At 9pm on a Wednesday in July this place was jammed...being my first time there, I was pleasantly surprised to find such a cool vibe inside. Not what I was expecting.

No tables? No problem, we only wanted take-out anyway. We placed the order and were told it'd be a 30-minute wait...for future reference I asked if they take dine-in reservations. Never, said the super-friendly staff guy, except for parties of 8 or more when reserved at least two weeks in advance. That's just an FYI.

Anyway we grabbed a drink on King St and returned half an hour later.

Sam Roas Pad Thai (we got it with chicken)...this was exceptionally delicious pad thai with great flavour that was surprisingly spicy. We asked for 'medium' spice but this was more like your standard Toronto HOT. So that's something to think about if you're a spice sissy :)

Khao Soi...creamy coconut-curry sauce with egg noodles and crispy noodles (we got it with braised beef). Let me just say, the coconut-curry sauce (holy generous portion!) was positively SCRUMPTIOUS and bursting with explosive Thai flavour. The braised beef was perfectly tender. But why egg noodles and why such a skimpy amount of them? My advice: order a side or two of steamed rice to mop up all the leftover sauce....we finished all the egg noodles and still had a ton of sauce leftover but nothing to eat it with. (Confession: I poured it over some pad thai noodles because it was just that good).

Other than that minor critique, the bottom line with this place is: SUPER-YUM."}
{"text":"Lineups are really long, but service is really quick to compensate. You may end up having to share a table with someone else.

My friend and I ordered the spring rolls to start, a curry rice and a pad thai. Our meal came really quickly and we finished our meal in about 40 minutes!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the old location, so when I saw they finally opened a new location, I had to check it out. 

The dining area is not much bigger than before, but now they have a bar upstairs. The portion of food became smaller. I ordered the 3 flavours pad Thai, which is their significant dish, I felt the dish was too saucy for a fried egg noodle dish. The noodles are soft, and it's \"sticky\". 

Having Pai and other Thai restaurants opened up in Toronto, I'm not sure if they will be able to maintain the old customers with the food quality and old menu."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious. Especially the special padthai so good, the street style like padthai from other restaurant. However, it's hard to look for it if you come the first time, and it's pretty loud, my boyfriend and I just ate our food and didn't talk to each other because we barely hear each other. Beside that, the food and serving are still amazing, I will come back :)"}
{"text":"Khao San Road and its sister restaurant Nana are one of the two major oligopolies of good Thai food in Toronto. KSR always has a long lineup and it's not exactly pleasant waiting out on Adelaide St in the cold, but it's usually worth it when it's off peak hours (less than 30 mins wait). Try the Squash Fritters and the Khao Soi, which I believe is one of their signature dishes."}
{"text":"I went here for take-out. They said 20 minutes so I had a soup from the next-door place.

The food actually came in about 15 minutes (and they were very busy) so that's nice.

Squash fritters - pretty great.
Spicy beef salad - not inspired. Won't order again.
Garlic tofu - best eat in. It gets too cool with take-out.
Pad gra prao - quite nice but I like Thai Princess a bit better

Staff seem nice and calm even when the place was super busy.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"There's a queue just to write your name on the waiting list and it's not even clear, as you have to ask other customers which is for getting your name on the list. We ordered the Pad Thai with shrimps. The taste was good, but the portion was small for the price. The beef salad was good but the beef was a little too tough. The Massaman curry was just ok. The vibe is lively, with loud music in the background, and is good for hanging out with friends. The servers were quite attentive."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food! Go early, as a line starts to form as the evening progresses. Reasonably priced, great flavors, great portions. Just a word of warning: It's quite loud in the restaurant, music & people. I don't mind it, but I have friends who would have issues hearing in a place like that."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is SCRUMPTIOUS, no,  orgasmic in every way.

Until very recently I didn't pay attention to the name of the restaurant, even though it was the natural choice for lunch when Burrito boyz seemed a little too far and my friend and I thought we'd faint before we get there. It had always simply been \"the Thai place around the corner with ambiguous writing.\"

I'm not sure when this place is NOT packed; I have been there various times of the day and I am always counting my luck for being able to find a seat for two. 
I am a fan of the open seating arrangement where strangers seat beside each other; very authentically oriental - automatic bonus points. 

The first time I went there, it was fairly new and we waited most of our lunch for our food. When it got to us, it was so good the two chatter boxes that we are, had no time to say anything, but ever so often look into each others eyes in absolute agreement of how fabulous the food was and how our senses were about to burst from delight.  We concluded that although the service was rather slow, the food was  absolutely worth every second of the wait. It was perfectly proportioned too; just enough to think that you will hit food coma, but not quite that you suffer food coma at work ;what a deal! My friend who is Thai varified that the street version of the Pad Thai is exactly as it is in Thailand. So woot  to that too!

I haven't been back there in awhile but my verdict stands, except the service is definitely better now.  They are absolutely friendly - once, we got there as the store was \"closing\" and the guy rushed us in and said, we're actually closing but if you sit down and order - you can stay as long as you want. He could have easily turned us away, but didn't , which my stomach appreciated by the buckets and I wanted to shine his bald head as a thanx....I didn't, of course.

This place is a gem: with all the generic \"Friendly Thai\"s popping up every corner, you don't really get to taste anything authentic anymore; except here.

All I can say is: you need to go - you are missing out a LOT."}
{"text":"Used to love the place, however was disappointed the last time I visited Khao San, the quality of food served is not the same., does not taste as good as it used too Also I felt the potion sizes have become smaller and the prices increased."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food!! I have tried Thai food in so may cities and so many countries. This one is the bessttt.. Everything in their menu is just delicious. their Pad thai and pad gra prow are my favourite. Papaya salad is great too. They are renovating but I still don't miss a chance of going to Nana and have Khao san. Yes its always super busy but its definitely worth the wait.."}
{"text":"After scouring Yelp for the best thai place in Toronto, we decided to give this one a shot and boy, am I glad we did.

Pros:
The food is phenomenal, and the portions were huge. Delicious!

Cons:
The music is a little loud, and the service lagged at times. We got there at about 7 on a Wednesday and waited about 40 minutes for a table--but it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Thank you Khao San for introducing me to Thai Food! and of course Yelp for guiding me in the right direction. I have been circling this restaurant like a vulture and eyeing it out for an opportunity to try out what seems to be all the rave in Toronto's Thai food scene. Having driven by a couple times during the weekend it was clear that a table for 4 was just not gonna happen at 8pm on a Saturday night. So we waited for the right chance and tonight we scored.

This place was stil pretty popping at 10pm (they shut the doors @10) on a Tuesday night. In fact, we were the very last customers permitted to enter before the manager apologetically turned away a few eager customers. We were seated within 10mins at one end of a tall wood table and shared the long table with 4 other diners on the opposite end. No problem in terms of spacing. The restaurant itself is quite small so that prolly explains the massive 2hour waits that are commonplace during their busy peaks.

The decor is modern and primarily dominated by the large bar which runs nearly the whole length of the place. The front is open to the outside and the kitchen is open as well in the back. Bathrooms are not the forte of this establishment but the smell of the food on my short walk there was enough to get me salivating.

No doubt the food was five stars. We ordered the Garlic Fried Chicken app - $10. As nice as these little fried (not greasy) pieces were, I would pass on this next time in favor of the Pad Thai or Glass Noodles. Next we ordered the Red Curry beef, Green Curry chicken, and lastly the Egg noodles in yellow curry - $14 each I believe. The curries were all distinctly unique and tantalizing in their own right sending an aromatic fusion of sensations from the tongue through the nose. The curries were served in small bowls and almost seemed like a soup as they were the focus of the dish. I tend to favor a larger portion for that value with more \"stuff\" in the curry - i like my dishes to be packed with the good stuff. What it lacked in size however, it compensated for in flavour. 

Steamed rice was provided with the curries but not with the yellow Noodle, which itself was also doused in curry sauce and could have used its own rice to soak up all the delicious flavour. Upon acknowledging this oversight I approached our server to ask for an extra bowl of steamed rice, but was quickly told that the kitchen was now closed and everything was being cleaned up....SERIOUSLY???...they could not spare one measly bowl of plain rice? I mean she didn't announce last call order opportunities nor did she even check in the back to see if there really was any extra rice to spare. Upon returning disappointed to the 3 bowls of pure sauce I decided to ask one more time. I explained the situation and said that even plain noodle or some sort of bread would suffice (we were not full yet and half the meal was in liquid form). She said she'd check the kitchen one more time to see if she could find anything. **At this point I was thinking \"Don't strain yourself, darling\"....Magically she returned shortly after with \"the last bowl\" of steamed rice. 

I've got to say this incident, plus the relative inaccessibility of the restaurant, bumped them down a star. Still, I am excited to have logged another set of unique and unexperienced flavors to my growing palette and I would jump at the opportunity to dine here again!"}
{"text":"They didn't have the two items I wanted most - grilled steak salad & squash fritters - but I still enjoyed the meal overall. Service is nice and the space is very casual with natural lighting from the floor-to-ceiling windows.

Best item:  Garlic Tofu & Garlic Chicken - absolutely LOVE the panko crust! Just as good with or without the dipping sauce. I would come back just for this.

Papaya salad was nice and refreshing (green papaya).

Green Curry Chicken - Medium spice level. Had a sweetness to it, but the spice still kicked in. The rice is on the wet/mushy side. 

Massaman Curry - A sweet curry with round ball potatoes and peanuts.

Tried both the Bangkok and Three Flavours Pad Thai - Medium spice level was not spicy at all. Generally quite sweet. They tasted very similar, but I think I prefer the Three Flavours with Shrimp (nice large pieces).

Note: no reservations. Only seated when full party arrives. Bar & Dessert upstairs under a separate name."}
{"text":"After making the mandatory pilgrimages to Suko Thai on Parliament and PAI, and experiencing the awesomeness that your taste buds get treated to at these otherworldly Thai spots, I had the bar set high for Khao San Rd. I'd heard about the line ups and the massive crowds this place drew and was expecting the worst of that as I approached the gates of this trendy downtown spot. 

Turned out, it was all for not. 

I got seated right away by a super friendly hostess who asked if I minded to share a table, which I was okay with.

I ordered the three flavors Pad Thai with chicken, two chillier of spice. First let me say that I am not much of a spice guy, but I'd heard it is good for your health so I went with the standard and it was perfect, just the right amount of fire. Seeing as I really don't usually like spice, that's saying they found the bliss point perfectly. My accompaniment was a glass of mango juice, which for $3.50 and arriving in a giant glass, was what I'd consider good value.

I have only one bone of contention with Khao San Rd., and it's their rolls. To be clear, I didn't order them. I was considering it, but when I saw the price, I couldn't justify it. I am not someone who minds spending on food, and the rolls might be as otherworldly as the Pad Thai is, but $10?? No spring rolls should ever cost that much. They may be great, but they can't be $10. 

Getting back to the positives, the atmosphere is fantastic too. They were playing some hip hop in the background, but not so loud that it distracted you from the food. The tables and chairs are comfy and at a good level so you don't feel like you're in a high chair, and the staff is very pleasant.

Great, and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Street Style Pad thai, Three Flavour Paid Thai, Garlic Chicken, Khao Soi, Panang Curry, Pad See Ew.

Khao San Road is probably the best Thai food Downtown Toronto!

If you are heading their for lunch during the week, make sure to be there by 11:45 latest or you'll be in for a long wait.  From my experience, heading their after work is not too bad.  

If you plan on visiting during the weekend, try to also come a little early as this place gets really busy!

They offer two different types of Pad Thais.  Try the chef's special paid thai (They call it the three flavour paid thai now)! 
It's very flavourful! 

The Garlic Chicken is a very good appetizer! Crispy and comes with a side of sauce!

I was the first person to try their Pad See Ew (the chef literally came and told me that, checked on how it was and asked for feedback after too).  I love Pad See Ew and I'm glad there is somewhere that actually offers it! The noodles for this dish is kind of like pasta, short but large width.  This might sound bad but I thought the Pad See Ew at Thai Express was a bit better...

The Khao Soi is a very popular dish and it's great in the winter time! So comforting.  If you're not sure what this is.. it's basically, noodles in a curry style soup, with your choice of meat.  It's actually really good but my colleagues said it was too much curry... not sure how you can have too much curry though!

I've now tried all the curry dishes on the menu and I have to say it's all good.  I wouldn't say the best... but it neither was disappointing nor exciting.

The Panang curry is one of my favourites! I loved it so much that I started making it at home!

The reason i say this place is not good for groups is because it gets busy really quickly and there are not that many seats! Try and make a reservation... but I think they don't accept reservations on weekends.

This is a go to spot for my friends and I!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place until Nuit left... But thank god they opened up Pai in the same hood - go here instead!!!!"}
{"text":"I love thai food (esp thai-styled curry) and Khao San did not disappoint! I must say, the Khao Soi with beef is spectacular and would recommend to anyone. I would also play it safe when it comes to the spiciness level, the range can be deceiving as it goes from 1 to 11. Trust me when I say level 3 spicy is already mouth-burning, and I am definitely one to be able to handle my spicy foods."}
{"text":"I had the Khoi Soi with beef; I ordered it spicy. The dish was was excellent!  The noodles are a combination of soft and crispy on top. The beef was super tender and it was very filling."}
{"text":"I love the food, I think this place has the best Thai food that I've experienced :)"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Khao San Rd. Best Pad Thai in the city I'd say. The only down side is they have limited seating so it makes getting a table pretty tough. The wait staff is amazingly friendly, and the food is always great. 
The Khao Soi was SOO good, we ordered another one because we were having trouble sharing it. The runner up would be the bang-kok pad thai, perfectly cooked noodles, the flavor is really savory and a bit sweet, perfectly balanced. If you're a fan of pad thai, this is the place for it hands down."}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about this place is that there is always a line. I would take a star away for not taking reservations, but I like everything else too much.

Living just around the corner, I average eating at Khao San Road about once every two weeks. It's just about the best Thai in the city, and the cool ambiance and location take it to the next level. No kitschy decor choices or dinginess - just a clean, modern palette that lets the food speak for itself.

And the food sings! You will find all the traditional Thai selections here but there are a couple of standout dishes. The Khao Soi is marvelous medium-spicy, the Massaman curry is the best I've ever had, and I've heard the Pad Thai is equally as good (not being a fan of the dish myself). To start off, you can't go wrong with the fresh rolls, squash fritters or daily soup. 

If only they would expand into the neighbouring space and eliminate the lineups, it would be perfection!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and already expected to wait. I was in a group of 5 so they said it was about an hour wait. Left our name and # with them and they said they'd call when there was a table ready. My friends and I headed over to second cup to keep warm. Probably 15 minutes later they called and said a table was ready! Perfect! Love when the wait time is way shorter than expected!

We were seated quickly and waters were brought out right away. Service here was really good. Perfect amount of time between waters and taking our orders and the food came out really quick but not TOO quick. Everyone was raving about their dish. I got the three flavour pad Thai and it was delicious! Not the best I've ever had but it was still really good! I got a taste of my friend's yellow curry and it was SO good. Even from just the little bite I had, I can't wait to order it myself next time. A few of my friends ordered Thai tea and they were all in love with the first sip.

Great experience here. I was dreading the hour wait but it wasn't as bad as expected! 2 thumbs up! Oh and our server was great! Very friendly and attentive! Kudos to him too!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere not loud enough that you can't have a conversation. I sat next to the tiled wall and it was a nice compliment to the experience. Food was really good as well. I had the Kung Pao Grano (I butchered the name but something along those lines lol) with Chicken and it was very flavourful. I felt the portion sizes were kind of to the smaller side though. Another thing I didn't like was the cups I got initially were dirty. But the server promptly replaced them after it was brought to his attention. Also, I had the opportunity to try the pad Thai and it was amazing highly recommend. Pricing is also super affordable - 2 plates, 2 drinks and a starter came to under 60."}
{"text":"Very good Thai place! 

It was a Sunday evening so we went right on time for them to open but the place was already full. After waiting for like 10 minutes we sat by the bar and started ordering. 

   The food was good. I  ordered spicy and it was okay but the guy next to us ordered Thai spicy and he was just sweating most of the time. 

One of the things I noticed is that they put A LOT of cilantro in everything. So if you don't like it or can't stand it, just avoid this place. 


Overall it was a good experience, but overrated as expected."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is over rated.  There, I've said it.  The whole no reservation/incredibly long wait is just so passe to me.  I would rather it be so busy that you couldn't get a reservation rather than them just not letting you book.  When I want to eat, I want to eat now!!

Food is not my favorite Thai food I have ever had.  Atmosphere is close together and busy.  Service is pushy and they are just ready to get you out the door as soon as you sit down because there is such a large line waiting after you.  

Menu is a little confusing but they have a vegetarian/vegan part of it...but it's just not worth sitting down and being shuffled around to try to figure out what's vegan and what's vegetarian.

Also, the place is here is very loud and it's hard to talk to everyone.

Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"OMG, I waited so long to go to Khao San Road!  I never got to go to their old location, and my girlfriend was raving about how the food was sooo good, just like the one she had in Bangkok and Phuket (I've never been to Thailand). 

Well, we went.  No line up for two people (larger groups would probably have to wait as the seating is cafeteria style).  

I saw that they had two Pad Thais and asked the girl who was bussing the tables what is the difference (she was the closest by) and she retorted: read the ingredients, you will figure it out.  Really? OK.

I had the Bangkok Pad Thai, and my girlfriend had Pad Gra Prao, and we shared a garlic shrip appetizer.  Unfortunately, the appetizer was the best dish.  My girlfriend had the Tom Yum soup and she wasn't impressed - didn't taste like in Thailand, no lemmongrass and different flavor. 

The Bangkok Pad Thai was overly salty and soaked in fish sauce which drowned any other taste.  Despite claims of \"The best Pad Thai in Toronto\" - this was one of the worse ones (I love Pad Thai and have it in every Thai restaurant I go).  Mediocre, at best. 

I tried my girlfriend's Pad Gra Prao - it seems like the cook dumped an entire salt shaker in it - so salty to be almost inedible.  Drank a gallon of water afterwards.  Otherwise the texture was ok.

So, there, I went to Khao San Road and will never return again.  So many better Thai places in Toronto and in the same neighborhood.  Another over-hyped Toronto restaurant for the we-like-waiting-in-line crowd."}
{"text":"My good friend recommended me to go this Khao San Road. It is now my favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto. The reason I gave it a 4 star because of the price. The dishes are delicious. I wouldn't go for spicy but mild is good too. I would love to go back again and order other dishes that I haven't try.  s2"}
{"text":"This rating is only for their food because I've always ordered take-out. The food here is flavourful . Its not just your boring red/yellow/green curry and pad Thai. They have a lot of variety. My favourites are the garlic chicken and the khao soi. The only problem I faced was in figuring out the spice level. I went with level 6 which was \"Thai spicy\" and I found that to be extremely hot. Maybe next time I'll try level 3."}
{"text":"1000+ reviews don't lie! Come here early or if it's busy you can grab drinks across the street. Definitely give this place a try and you'll be back. Everything is good!!"}
{"text":"First, no RSPVs. Second, be ready to rub elbows with people you don't know/may not care to know. It is a very small venue, maybe a 40 person occupancy at most. The food was ok, from what was edible. A multitude of things lead up to a one-star review.

First, it was a Tuesday evening and was very busy. We don't mind the wait due to the stellar reviews. Once sat, the table top next to the patio benches was cramped and hot. OK... that's fine. We are really here because of the reviews. The female hostess had not interest in us as she walked us to this table and threw the menus on the table and walked off. We waited 10 minutes for someone to bring us water, or ask us for a beverage, but this... THIS.. is what started this eff'd up dinner service. A male server came over after 10 minutes. He came to the table, only to say \"I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.\" OK... no worries. They were crazy in there and maybe he needed to run some food. NO. NO. NO. He never came back. I looked at him talking to other patrons at the bar. I legitimately made eye contact with 3 times, with the 4th time burning a hole through his forehead. HE NEVER CAME BACK. We had to flag down a totally different guy who wasn't serving our section and he took our order, repeated it back to us, and everything seemed ok from there. The tofu starter was nice and crispy. The Thai Tea, a bit watered down but still enjoyable in the humid restaurant. 

Here comes the FUN!! First, as a backstory, the couple sitting next to us ordered chicken Pad Thai and received shrimp Pad Thai. He flagged the waiter who didn't really seem to comprehend what the issue was. The patron was kind enough to eat the shrimp, but asked not to be charged for it. Not sure how that story ended up because we left since I was fuming. 

Anywho, So my BF doesn't like greens. As in no onions, no basil, no cilantro, etc.. When we get our dishes, Yellow Curry for me, Pad Thai for him, it has green flakes of SOMETHING. If you have dined here, then you know that all of their ingredients are mentioned in the description. We flagged down the waiter who left us high and dry the first time around to tell him about this. OF COURSE, he has no idea what's going on because HE didn't take the order. So he literally takes the plate and takes it to his friend, the other waiter. The waiter comes back to say that it is cilantro. Well... THE DESCRIPTION DOESN'T SAY CILANTRO! After consulting the menu, he takes the plate back to the kitchen, only to come back now stating that it is Coriander. WTF? Do ANY of you know what hell is in the shit that you serve? Is this a joke? 

We asked for it to be remade without the \"Coriander\" but the hostess (who apparently knows how they cook in the kitchen...) said that the Pad Thai can't be made without it. SOOOOOOOO what you really mean to tell me is that it's all pre-made and that it would have to be picked out. Thanks!

Needless to say, the BF didn't eat it. I did have a taste and it was a great dish, but the service really pissed me off. Nowadays in the restaurant industry, and any industry for that matter, if your goods aren't coupled with great customer service, people don't give a rat's ass.

To end a long, noisy night, the original waiter came over to do his \"rounds. I told him to take the plate away. He had the audacity to ask if we wanted a box... (Are you effing deaf? Were you just not mentally present 15 minutes ago? OMG!) To which I rudely replied, \"NO. He isn't going to eat it because he ordered no greens and you won't remake it!\"

Call it what you will. I call it being real."}
{"text":"Seriously lived up to the hype. I am usually disappointed when I believe the hype but this restaurant was the first one I actually enjoyed with high ratings in the downtown core area. Although one of the female waitresses was a little snappy with me I still give this store a 5/5. Keep up the good work! I shall certainly be returning with more friends :) 

P.S. the wait time's a bit on the longer side if you come with a group larger than 2."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but  it is hard to get a table there. If you come in a group of 3 people during lunch hour, and there is an empty table for 4, they will NOT let you sit. Instead, you will be told to wait. Ridiculous. 

Also, it is insanely loud there."}
{"text":"So much yum but go off peak hours. They get busy fast and you can stand outside waiting for a while."}
{"text":"We put in a reservation and had a bit of a wait.  Overall though it was worth the time.  They were nice to recommend a place nearby to grab a drink.  This helped with the experience.  The service was very good.

The food was spicy, but one of the best Thai experiences I've had.  The atmosphere is a bit loud and crowded, but it wouldn't prevent me from going back.  The portions and variety of options were great.  Would be a great place for a smaller group of friend, but I wouldn't recommend a large party."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town. Very spicy."}
{"text":"So went back at their new location not much to write home about. 

Super salty food compared to short wait times relative to Pai and some surrounding Thai resto's.  

The layout is also horrible. 

Subpar food, terrible service (asked for the bill 4 times) and just a shitty overall experience. No thumbs up here."}
{"text":"To start with, I don't know where  bad reviews come from. I love Thai food and I have had my fair share of Thai food in Toronto. I have to say the Three Flavor Pad Thai (9/10) I had at Khao San Road is the best I've had in town! It has a very balanced taste of sour, salty, and bit sweetness. We also ordered fresh rolls and fried chicken. Both dishes were really delicious and had good presentation. Their dipping sauces tasted different from other places. They are so yummy you just wanna keep eating them!

I was there in a busy night, but the food came 5 mins after we put in our order. I was very pleased with that too! 

One thing wasn't 8 out of 10 is the Thai Ice Tea (7/10). I found ice tea here is a bit too sweet, maybe too much condense milk?

Khao San Road doesn't take reservation. Try to get there before 6:30 to avoid the lineup!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. First time. Knocked my socks off. Got there a few minutes before noon and there were a total of two seats left. Both at the bar. I was seated immediately at the bar and served by the attentive and very pleasant bar tender. 

When I tasted the Thai iced tea, I knew I was in for a treat. The main was fantastic. I had Beef Khao Soi. Truly excellent dish. I asked for medium spice. Which was quite spicy, and very much to my taste. The egg noodles were cooked so perfectly in this dish. The beef was tender and delicious. I am definitely going to come back here and work my way through the menu. Oh Lord, sweet yummy goodness!"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious!!  The buckets taste like you're in Thailand and the pad Tai is the best I've had since I've been back!"}
{"text":"My love of Thai food continues with a visit to Khao San Road. I've been hearing about this place for a long time so I was looking forward to this.

It was quite busy when we arrived but we got a table near the entrance almost right away. Good timing. The menu was simple, a double-sided card, with enough choices to satisfy most cravings. For three of us, we chose a couple of starters and a couple of mains, all with Medium to Thai Spicy level. Oh, boy...

The Grilled Steak Salad (beef, onions, red bell pepper, cilantro, scallion, fish sauce, oyster sauce, ground toasted rice, long leaf cilantro, mint, chili) was delicious! All the ingredients played really well with each other and the steak itself was tender and had a nice flavour.

The Papaya Salad (green papaya, long bean, cherry tomato, fresh roasted peanuts, carrot, green chili, dried shrimp, garlic) had more liquid than I'm used to seeing in this dish but it tasted very good.

The Pad See Ew with Chicken (wide rice noodles, Chinese broccoli, egg, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce) was flavourful and spicy. It had a generous amount of chicken.

I love curry so I enjoyed the Kua Gling with Pork (spicy housemade curry paste, fresh makrut lime leaf, served on rice). It was a simple dish of curried ground pork, served on top of white rice. It was also the spiciest of the dishes that we ordered.

All the food tasted very good so Khao San Road did not disappoint. The service was also good, with frequent water refills (thankfully). If I had to nitpick, the presentation could have been more creative - maybe different plates and/or garnishes. Just come for the food!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS packed.  Why people are prepared to wait 30, 60, 90 minutes??? for a seat is beyond my understanding.  Do yourself a favour, don't bother waiting.  Lunch or dinner, this place gets full.

I would not wait more than 5 minutes to eat at this place.  The food here is decent thai, but I personally don't think it's anything 'mind blowing' by any means.  And it's more expensive than other thai places for most dishes.

Take away is probably a much better option, but still, you can be waiting at least 30 mins for it.  If you could call ahead too that would be great, but they don't seem to pick up the phones when they get really busy in the evenings.  (What's with that, really?)

The beef curry with moist and dry noodles seems to be very popular and favourite with people.

The staff can ooze attitude a little bit sometimes too. Sure, they are busy, but still.

If the owners had any brains they would expand already and have another join."}
{"text":"Incredible food. This must be some of the best Thai food in North America and there are 1000 other reviews of what to order.

Strategy:

I like walking by at odd hours and seeing if the line is short.

Otherwise it's too unpredictable."}
{"text":"Super yum but not as exceptional as everyone keeps raving. Just above average Thai food."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of their old location, even though it was cramped, had line-ups and was so loud. I was excited to visit their new location and enjoy the ambiance improvement along with great food. 

I ordered my old favorite, the khao soi. It tastes like how I remembered: creamy, spicy and delicious. Unfortunately, it seems like the portion size has gone way down. Maybe it was because I was so hungry but I finished the soft noodles in two bites. Then I spent the rest of the meal fishing out chicken and crunchy noodles out of the soup, wondering where all the noodles went. Is it just me? I vividly remember their khao soi being so big that I had trouble finishing it. Sadly, not anymore.... I finished my meal way before my dinner-mates and was still a little hungry afterwards. Minus one star for the sad portion."}
{"text":"The squash fritters are sooooooo gooood!!! I also ordered the Bangkok style pad thai, which I did not end up finishing because it was such a large portion. Definitely going to revisit in the near future :)))"}
{"text":"Khao San Road was just \"OK\". Yeah I understand people may be shocked or upset that I'm not raving about this place but sorry, it wasn't impressive. 

Was the food good? I guess. Was it worth the line up wait? No chance. All in all, I felt like quite let down but that might have something to do with the fact that people in this city love to rant about popular places. Maybe it's those trend-following annoying people who wouldn't stop talking about Khao San Road that ruined Khao San Road for me. Or maybe it was just because Khao San Road was just another Thai restaurant. 

You know, come to think of it, I kind of like saying Khao San Road now too. Am I becoming one of those followers now too?? Ummmm no.

In all fairness to the restaurant, as this is a public review, most of the staff was polite and friendly. The owner was there too, he seems like a nice guy."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Yelp, I would have never discovered this place.  My friend and I purposely trekked over here on a Friday night (IN THE RAIN) to go eat this little restaurant.

If you didn't know about the restaurant, you probably wouldn't be able to find it due to the lack of a sign (possibly because it JUST opened).

Decor was very simple and very relaxing.  I loved the chalkboard wall that they had.  Service was great -- all the waitresses there were kind and friendly.

My friend and I sat at the bar because there were a lot of people and a few reservations.  We didn't mind.  

I ordered the Gaeng Panang, and my friend ordered the Gaeng Massaman.  I thought the panang was okay - but not as sweet as I would have liked in.  I really enjoyed my friend's Massaman.

I would really suggest the Thai Iced Tea -- it just went down sooooo smoothly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fortunately my office is situated right between Khao San Road and Pai Northern Kitchen so great Thai food is never far when I have a craving at lunch.

My favourites here are the Pad Gra Prow and the Khao Soi. Both are delicious.

Haven't been disappointed with this place yet."}
{"text":"Way overrated place. Went there on a weekday 6PM and was full house. Food was OK but way too oily and a bit too salty (esp the fried curly dish - way too much)."}
{"text":"Pretty much your classic example of an overhyped restaurant. It's one thing to receive a meal that's fine but nothing earth-shattering, but it is quite another to have to wait more than 2 hours to be seated for it. 

I ordered the green curry, which was the very definition of \"average\". My friend ordered the curry soup (with beef and noodles), which was definitely tastier. Another friend's Pad Thai also evidenced strong, robust flavor. Just a shame that I was left with the weakest dish. The food in general is overpriced."}
{"text":"Given the amount of attention this place has been getting I decided to check it out.

We had:
Chicken pad thai (3.5/5)
Shrimp green thai curry (3/5)

While the food was good, was not the best thai food I have ever had. The green thai curry was lacking flavor and I would have preferred it to be thicker.

I will give it one more chance."}
{"text":"I was a single in town for work and was looking for some good Thai food. This place came highly recommended by the hotel I was staying at. 

I was seated within 10 minutes. I loved the community seating. I got to know the people around me.

The food.... What can I say. It was outstanding. I even tried some of my neighbors and it was all excellent. Will definitely go back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The best in t.dot in my opinion! My party and I ordered the squash fritters and it was totally worth it, I thought it was going to taste like a crispy sweet potato fries (not that it's disgusting, I love it! But this caught me off guard). It tasted crispy, light, and if you like tasty shrimp cracker chips then you won't regret it. 

Can't go wrong with any of their main dishes but try khao soi, this was amazing in flavour, very creamy, and coconut-ty but after half way it gets to be too much since its a very heavy dish, but if your feeling like a hungry hippo then this will satisfy your craving. 

And my last highlight would have to go to the Thai Ice Tea, all I can say is your going to regret stepping out of the restaurant if you don't try this with your meal. It's very creamy and yet light at the same time, it's a perfect balance of the bitter tea taste with a hint of sweetness and creamy-ness.

I would suggest coming in as soon as they open, this place gets packed very fast especially if your party is an odd number. Other than that, food was amazing, service was surprisingly fast, and its a hip, cool, loud ambience, I wouldn't bring someone here to talk but if you want amazing thai food....This is definitely the place to be"}
{"text":"Best pad thai I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's bigger than it seems and has a bar with a separate menu upstairs. They offer a regular, vegan and gf menu. You get to choose your spice level.
Some seating is a community tables and others are individual tables. Service is friendly but can take some time to get your food....but they let you know that.
They don't take reservations but the wait was less than 30 minutes and worth it. Price was moderate."}
{"text":"My first time here for dinner with a group of four.  I smelled good food at the time I stepped in.  Waited for half an hour.  We ordered squash fritters, two khao soi, phad thai, red curry with chicken and ice thai tea.  The squash fritters is the best.  Crispy, not oily and the sauce is fabulous.  Everything is delicious and the price is reasonable.  $25/person.  
** They only seat full parties **
** Green P across the street $5 for weekend's evening.  Cash and accept coins only **"}
{"text":"Probably some of the best Pad Thai I have ever had! I got the 3 flavors pad thai #4 spicy and loved it! It was flavorful, not heavy on the sweetness and just so dang delicious I ate it all very quickly. We also got the squash fritters and they were crispy and delicious too, my boyfriend loved them! He also got the thai bucket and it's literally a bucket of rum and thai red bull, the think the energy from the red bull balanced out his drunkness from the rum. Luckily we got there just before a huge line gathered so be prepared to wait. I would go back to Toronto just to have this meal again."}
{"text":"Not as good as the reviews show, the Pad Thai and Garlic tofu were ok, Thai ice tea was too sweet and Pad Gra Prao was dry."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Thai restaurant in Toronto. It started w/ the welcoming host doing his best to seat us on a busy Friday night. Then the food. It's pretty damn good.

Fresh rolls w/ homemade chicken sausage and dipping sauce just had all kinds of good flavor.

Squash fritters were tasty, crispy and light w/o being greasy.

Pad Gra Prao. Spicy, full of flavor and tasty

Pad Phed Pha - Spicy and full of flavor in a totally different way.

Gaeng Graree - Excellent curry that's sweet and savory and creamy and yummy.

Chai nom yen was flavorful and refreshing. The Sinha stood up well to the spice.

I'm gonna go here a lot more."}
{"text":"there is a fly in my soup... totally disappointed in the food quality. probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time this evening. It was busy with a line out front (as expected) because it's popular and they don't take reservations. Fortunately a few parties of two bailed so we didn't wait too long. We sat at the bar and the server asked us about 2 minutes after we sat down what we wanted. We told her we didn't know yet and she came back about three times before we actually ordered. She wasn't the best server I've ever had because she was very abrupt. I think that was her nature rather than an intent to be rude. On the plus side she was prompt in refilling our water and asking if we wanted additional items/drinks/dessert.

My friend and I shared the three flavors Bangkok style pad thai, the yellow panang curry and Pfaff pinot grigio. The server asked when we ordered if anyone was vegan (because they cater to that as well as gluten free). I said no but that I'm vegetarian and didn't want any fish/fish sauce/oyster sauce etc and she seemed to understand.

The food was actually very nice but extremely spicy. We ordered spice level 3 (of a possible 11) and I needed about a litre of water to get through it. I'd hate to see what level 11 tasted like. I really enjoyed the wine as well - would definitely get that again.

Suggestions for improvement:
- Vegetarian spring rolls as an appetizer addition. They only had ones with chicken sausage and it wasn't clear if you could substitute.
- Note the wine origin on the chalkboard menu (since there isn't a physical one). It's interesting and for some wines location really matters.
- Washroom could be nicer

When all's said and done, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Going back after 2 years and I felt they really stepped it up a notch. New location is quite cool. Absolutely loved the fried squash appetizer and also got the green curry fried rice which was delicious. My friends got the Penang curry and pad Thai which were also up to the mark. Well done khao San road! I'll be back real soon"}
{"text":"What a great place! Just perfect, the only thing is on Saturday night it can get really crowded, that that's because it's so good. We showed up at night on a Saturday and the wait was 30 minutes. But the host immediately thought outside the box and offered us 3 seats at the bar. Everyone else waiting wanted a table. We sat at the bar and had an awesome meal. \"Pad See Ew\" and \"Three Flavours Pad Thai\" are awesome options. Huge variety of wines, and they have \"Singha\" (beer from Thailand), it's the only beer they serve. Service was quick and good on a crowded night. Will definitely be going back. Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves Thai food and was raving about this place, so when his family was visiting we got take out. I have to say, as someone who doesn't care too much for Thai food I was blown away. The food here is really amazing! Everything I tried was really good and tasted fresh. We had a decent sized group so we ordered:

Red Curry
Yellow Curry with Shrimp
Bangkok Style Pad Thai with Chicken
Green Curry Fried Rice
Khao Soi with Beef

We got everything as Medium Spice except for the Green Curry Fried Rice which we got Spicy. I love spicy things so the Green Curry Fried Rice was my favorite. The Pad Thai was a crowd pleaser for sure!! We had a lot of Yellow Curry left over and we used it on fresh cooked chicken the next day with lunch and dinner and it was awesome.

We will be frequent visitors here for take out for sure."}
{"text":"Can't ever go wrong with this place. great great food. cool atmosphere, perhaps a little noisy for your parents but not for me.  
When in doubt, get the Khao soi but do try other the rest."}
{"text":"As others say, really good food.  I enjoyed my red chicken curry and my friends Pad Thai tasted very authentic.    Please note, when ordering \"hot\" it is very hot.  I love extremely spicy foods and was literally sweating while eating my red chicken curry.   

They are only getting 3 stars because the hostess is just so rude and I detest the \"no being seated until your entire party arrives\" policy.  There were 5 of us physically there but they wouldn't seat us until our 6th showed up.   I really find this frustrating.   Further, when we were finally seated, they put the 6 of us at a four top. I will not be returning here because of the service, which is too bad because the food is very good.   Next time I will go to the newer place on Duncan."}
{"text":"If I could give the food here 10 stars, I would. Easily my favourite spot for Thai food in the city! Yes, the place gets super crowded. Yes, you'll probably have to wait eons for a table during peak hours, but... if it's a delicious meal you're looking for, this is it!

I've visited this place several times and I always order their chicken pad thai. On occasion, I've also ordered their Khao Soi. Both dishes are so full of flavour, so intricately woven with the spiciness, sweetness, and tanginess only well-cooked Thai food can give you. Even after we clean up our plates, we keep wanting more. (The couple next to us at our last visit literally did. After gobbling up their meal, they ordered the chicken paid thai again... twice). What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a pleasure to have a meal at this place. 

For two people, with tax and tip, for normally around 2 main dishes, we normally pay around $30.00. Keep in mind that street parking is limited. Also, be warned that it gets very busy. We've visited at off-peak hours (late-late lunch, or early dinner), where we got a table right away, so consider coming here at a time when it's less busy."}
{"text":"Went with a friend from TO who recommended this place. It did not disappoint. We arrived just when they opened and within 1/2hr the place was packed. I guess lots of people know about where to get great Thai!
Had the panang curry with shrimp. Warned about the spice levels so got it \"Mild\" and it was spiced perfectly for me. Not skimpy on the shrimp, they were perfectly cooked and delicious.
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent green curry.  Kind of a small place.  Reasonable prices.  I also loved the spring rolls.  I'm normally not a fan of these but they were delicious.  I highly recommend this place especially if it just one or two people."}
{"text":"Excellent food. A little too tight seating wise. Waited for 15 minutes but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food and quick, polite service. Nice atmosphere too. There's always been a long wait to get a table whenever I've gone, but they offer to take your number and call when your table is ready - so you can go around the corner and grab a drink while you wait :)"}
{"text":"Busy place. Waited 20 mins but it's ok. The food was good. I like the red curry. Delish. I didn't care so much for sharing tables like the way they do but luckily we sat by the bar. The decor is simple. The service was nice. The food was overall... pretty good but small portions."}
{"text":"I am not a Thai food guru - I've never been to Thailand and so I don't know what \"real pad thai\" should taste like. I was coming here hoping to find out, with so many rave reviews about how this is the greatest Thai place in Toronto and the best pad thai.

Yes, the wait is long, but it's like that at any great restaurant in Toronto. Right, they don't take reservations, and they won't seat you till everyone in your group is present.  Look past that, and service is OK. I did not experience the snobbishness that other reviewers mention.

We had a fairly large group, so we ordered many of the different items (and a few vegetarian items -- apparently they have a separate vegan menu too), so I got an exposure to a lot of the stuff. All I can say is that it was decent. Was the pad thai good? Well, it tasted better than the typical Thai place in the GTA that is typically not really Thai and instead run by Chinese or Vietnamese people. That's about it. Apart from that, it was not particularly satisfying and there was nothing special about it. The place seemed seriously overhyped and I came here expecting much more.

I have had much better Thai throughout the course of my travels, and even in some American cities. I have never really gone out of my way to look for a good Thai restaurant in Toronto, but if this place really is the best, then I am terribly disappointed.  Maybe it's just a case of unrealistic expectations unmet, but really, when people say this is the best pad thai in Toronto, what are they comparing it to -- Thai Express?"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Nice servers who offer quick and efficient service in such a busy place. I'll be back for sure! Only con is how loud it is."}
{"text":"Ugh sorry i don't see the hype for this place. It's super packed, service is extremely poor, and the food is average.

They really need to do a better job of crowd control and maybe have 1 more person as an additional worker there since everyone seemed to be looking for a waiter or a hostess whether it was to pay the bill or even put their name down on the list to be seated. Or maybe it was the fact that no one will actually approach you and ask if you need help. It seemed like if you didn't flag anyone down or ask for help, you would be standing there helpless.

I got the  Khao Sai dish and i wasn't blown away by it. It wasn't terrible, but not fantastic.

I wouldn't try this place again."}
{"text":"It's good, if a bit sugary, and hard to get into. If you're a twosome you can probably squeeze in at the bar, but as the other reviewers mention, if you're big group you'll definitely need some organizational discipline to be there on time, and together.

Food is really good though. Wish they gave you more rice so you could take advantage of the sauce."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai restaurant in the city. The food is amazing. They only thing I would change is the service; the servers can be a little inattentive because they're so busy. That said we've tried almost everything on the menu and love all of it. My personal favourite is the red curry.  The wait times could be better  too. But all in all we love this place."}
{"text":"Fresh and zesty Thai food for any palette.  From sweet curries to spicy Pad Thai (and Sew) a great place to eat. 

More expensive than your average Thai place, but then the food is above average.  Expect to wait in line for at least 15 mins or skip the line and order pickup!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a couple of friends on a Thursday afternoon, after hearing so many rave reviews about this place. I was certainly not disappointed. The restaurant itself was very well-kept, clean, and nicely organized with plenty of room for walking around -- a challenge for when you are presented with smaller floor space. The decor of the place makes the establishment feel very welcoming and inviting, as if you have stepped into another place. Plus stars for ambience.

I ordered the chicken yellow curry, which came not only in a modest amount of time, but also in gigantic proportions! There was a mound of rice which is quite filling. The curry was perfectly done. I requested mild spice as the spiciness level and it was perfectly done to my taste. I came back again for the wonderful food and the very reasonable prices! This time I ordered Khao Soi and Squash Fritters as suggested by my boyfriend. I was skeptical about the fritters but to be honest I have been craving them since I had them.

I went back again recently but it was during TIFF and the place was fully reserved. I hope they would expand their infrastructure as this restaurant is definitely becoming the best THAI places in the Toronto."}
{"text":"Quality and price has stayed the same - good (but overrated), and pricey (but not outrageous for downtown Toronto)

Nevertheless, this used to be one of my favorite places to go. However, they've adopted a somewhat insulting policy of not seating you until the entire party is there, even when the place is more than half empty during off hours. As the son of a retired restaurateur, this seems counterintuitive to providing a good customer experience.

Portions have shrunk considerably. For $19, you get what used to be the lunch portions of curry."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day. They do not take reservations. We waited 30 minutes upstairs where they served drinks and snack food. We ordered shrimp chips and dip. The dip was incredibly spicy, and the waiter did not give much detail as to what it would be like. 
The setting is beautiful, nice seats and clean, we loved the tiles. 
The music was awful and way too loud, especially for such a lively place that already has so much natural noise. 
We ordered a chicken appetizer ($11) which was the highlight of the evening, and four pad thai's at $17 each. 

Our food took close to an hour, our small water glasses were refilled once after asking several times. The dish was tasty and came as described but the level of spice lacked, for having a spicy réputation we expected much more. 

They really should have anticipated a higher volume for being a holiday. The peanuts for your pad Thai should never cost extra and the dish should be served with a slice of lime. We were 3/4 done the plate when 2 thin slices of lime arrived at the table for four orders of pad Thai......

I was disappointed, service wasn't that friendly, definitely wasn't fast, and the bill wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Got there promptly at 5pm because we didn't want to deal with line ups (and no, they don't do reservations)

Everything was delicious - I highly recommend the SQUASH FRITTERS ($11) as an appetizer. We also got the GARLIC SHRIMP ($10).  The garlic shrimp were great to munch on but I'm not sure I would order it again. The squash fritters on the other hand were phenomenal. The dipping sauce that accompanies the fritters were a wonderful sweet and sour sauce.

The KHAO SOI ($14) was delightful both in presentation and in taste. Heavy in coconut flavour, and very rich and creamy. The contrast between the crunchy noodles and the actual sauce was delicious.

BANGKOK-STYLE PAD THAI with Chicken ($15) - No presentation required, all that's needed is a hot plate of Pad Thai in all its glory. Perfect amount of tang and spiciness and the noodles were springy and perfectly cooked.

PANANG CURRY ($14) - Comforting and spicy. Perfect if it's cold outside. They are quite generous with their toppings as we got a lot of beef and vegetables!

For dessert, we got the SA KOO MA PRAO ($4.50), a sweet and salty coconut tapioca dessert. Sounds like a strange way to finish off a meal, but it was a perfect way to end off. Sweet but not overly so , with a hint of saltiness. Loved it!

To wash it all down, a cold Singha for my pops and a Thai Iced Tea ($4) for us. BTW. If you order something too spicy, GET THE THAI ICED TEA. It does a phenomenal job of clearing the palate (and spiciness!) and prepping your mouth for the next dish. 

The only downside is that, like all good restaurants, it can be difficult to get a table."}
{"text":"This place is overrated and too expensive. There's plenty of better Thai restaurants in Toronto. Was there one night with friends, her parents were visiting from Halifax and has never experienced Toronto before so we wanted to show them around. Bad decision as the service here was horrible!!! They kept rushing us to leave. The food is mediocre. Expensive and portions are small. At the end of the night the hostess came up to us and rudely told us we had to leave because there was a line up. When we left there was no line up at all. I can understand that you need to run a business by keeping the flow of customers moving but she was so disgustingly rude and obnoxious. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"After reading the FAQ on their website, I was a little intimidated to come as they don't take reservations and it seemed like a very busy spot. I went on a friday around 2pm and it was still quite busy. We were ignored for quite some time upon entering, but as soon as a table was free we were treated very nicely and sat right away. Good service and atmosphere except no where to put our coats and bags. 

Despite this, the food was great. We had garlic chicken for an appetizer and the dipping sauce was amazing! I ordered pad gra prao \"thai spicy\" and it was the perfect level of spice for me (even though the waiter tried to talk me out of it). I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Highest rated Thai joint on Yelp for a reason.

Came here with a Korean friend, and we overconfidently ordered 'Thai Spicy' Khao Soi (egg noodles in curried coconut milk) and Kua Gling (curry paste over rice) based on our ability to handle Korean spicy food.

The food that came was AMAZING, hands down the best Thai food we've ever had. Although it was super spicy, also the spiciest Thai food we've ever had (and spicier than some of the spiciest Korean food we've ever had). The service was amazing, and I say that because the waitress, recognizing our capsaican-induced tears, came often to refill our water. If that's not service I don't know what is.

To summarize: YUM."}
{"text":"It's official - Khao San Road and Sukho Thai have the Thai food market cornered in Toronto. These guys know their craft, and execute on it perfectly. 

Everything I've had at this restaurant has been at least \"very good\", if not \"stellar\". Notable mentions at this particular restaurant go out to the squash fritters and the green curry. I love the fact that their green curry has bamboo shoots in it. 

The interior designer did quite good job with this restaurant, which makes it a no-brainer for a night out dining, or to celebrate an event of any occasions. Even the menus are some of the best designed menus I've seen in the city.

You will have to wait quite a bit in order to get a seat here, but it is definitely worth the wait. If you don't want to wait, I recommend take out (if you live in the area), because the food itself, as I mentioned before is the best Thai food in the city that I've tried up until this point

Also, the staff are very friendly, especially the owner. It's amazing how every single time I go in there, the owner is almost always there, and he's always friendly, calm, and very appreciative of your business. Considering how busy that place is, it's impressive that he can keep that kind of a disposition at all times. It really adds to the experience."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite places in Toronto for Thai food... If not my favorite. I remember the first time I went to Khao San Road years ago (when it was at the previous location), I told them to make it actual **spicy**, not North American spicy. That was a mistake. I tapped the table and cried mercy. (For what it's worth, I can eat very spicy food). But ever since then, I've toned it down, ordered food like normal people would and it tastes so very good!

Several things I really like about it here. It's bright! Most of the seats are communal, so you get plopped wherever without having to wait too long. There service is also fast as well, so it's not like we'd have to order and wait forever before we can eat.

Oh yeah, and the food has really clean and fresh tastes to it. The problem are pretty big. We were commenting that maybe next time instead of doing one entree and two mains, we could swap and get two entrees and one main... (To be honest, we didn't finish our 1 entree or any of our mains, so maybe 2 entrees is too large too). But the entree came pretty quickly, and we had plenty to nibble on until the mains came. We didn't wait forever for our drinks either. Their Thai ice tea was really good, as was the mango juice. 

We felt the food was reasonably priced. We saw some notice about prices and minimum wages etc on their walls, but I didn't really process what the message was. I just hope they're able to keep prices and services the same here."}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic Thai food. Arrive early to avoid waiting in line for a long time."}
{"text":"The Tum Yum soup is great! All Pad Thais are great as well! Be careful of the spice level you choose."}
{"text":"Was craving Thai food and looking for a spot on Yelp to try out while wandering downtown and luckily stumbled upon this place! Upon entering the restaurant, make sure you're standing in the right line depending on if you're looking to dine in or take out; as there were many before us standing in the wrong line. 

The restaurant was real lively and packed with many people for a Tuesday night when my bf and I went. We were seated at a sharing table which we did not mind as we were already starving. As we walked to our table, we were drawn by the smells and various amazing looking dishes. As we looked at the menu, we decided to order the Zucchini Fritters, Chicken Sasuage Fresh Rolls and the Yellow Curry with chicken. My gosh, all our dishes were superb! The Fritters were an amazing portion, light and crunchy with a yummy tangy dipping sauce. The fresh rolls were also a hit for my bf and I. The yellow curry which came with a bowl of rice was very aromatic and flavorful, however the portion of rice to curry didn't match up, so we ordered another bowl of rice. 

Though the restaurant was packed, our server was very attentive in clearing plates, filling our water as well as checking in on how are meal is going. Both my bf and I were happy to find this spot and we're looking forward to coming back to try more items on the menu as well as check out their upstairs bar which apparently sells bar snacks that you can't get at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Short review: Frustrating service, good food

Detailed version: 

Food: 
The main dish I had was excellent - The pad kee mao. It had this fantastic sweet and savory flavor. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the chicken was cooked just right - soft, tender, and exceptionally tasty. The squash fritters - though not as good as the main dish - were a nice treat to snack on before the meal.

Service:
I have very mixed emotions about this place. I say emotions because the way I was treated by the staff made me very upset. I have a feeling I was judged by the host immediately (based on my appearance). 

It is a Monday, it is 6 PM, it's not busy in the restaurant. There are maybe 10 total tables and 5 tables occupied when my guest and I walk in. The host proceeds to walk us by a couple empty tables and force us to share a table with a couple who seemed to be having an intimate dinner. We asked if we could be seated at one of the other tables and were met with a response \"those tables are reserved for bigger groups\". The tables at this establishment are for 4 people.. Of the 5 tables occupied, 3 of them had parties of 2. 

The place cleared out within 5 minutes. Now it was basically our table left in this restaurant. Instead of being considerate and asking if we'd like to get our own table now, they continued to socialize amongst themselves. 

Completely aggravating. Almost ruined the restaurant for me. The amazing food salvaged the night. Only recommend for take out."}
{"text":"Love the vibe, music and service. Food was a bit too salty and couldn't finish, but the first few bites were amazing. I ordered the drunken noodles (off menu)."}
{"text":"Woah!  I ordered a spicy level 6 from their signature dishes menu (pad gra prao) with pork and fried egg. At first I didn't think it was spicy, then the kick started when I ate the hot pepper.  My nose haven't ran so well in a long time. I'll try spicy level 11 some other time.  My colleagues ordered red curry, massaman curry, vegan coconut curry, they all said their food was amazing. The best part about this restaurant is that they have a menu just for vegans and another menu for gluten free. One of my vegan colleagues was really pleased. The only down side is the spacing and it really does get packed, so need to get there before the rush."}
{"text":"I visited back in July (didn't check in because I'm American and didn't have data and promptly forgot about reviewing) after looking online for great places to eat in Toronto. Khao soi was the clear recommendation. It was more of a big bowl of soup than something like curry or fried rice that I was expecting. The flavor isn't super strong (the way the vinegar and soy sauce can be overpowering in three cup chicken) but it is rich in that I think it's largely coconut milk and thus quite fatty and heavy feeling. The curry itself is not quite like any other curry I remember having. It's more on the sweet side without truly being sweet, not noticeably spicy, and very yellow. Because of the heavy feeling of the coconut milk base, I would've preferred more \"ingredients\" (chicken and noodles) relative to the liquid. You could eat it yourself but it'd be more enjoyable split with someone I think. Then you could have some lighter fare (relatively speaking) to finish off dinner."}
{"text":"Came here pretty early for dinner (around 6pm) and it wasn't too packed yet. The hostess that night was pretty confusing, I walked in not knowing where I was supposed to wait, and she ignored me and instead carried on a conversation with one of her friends I believe? Anyway, she finally told me that she would take my name outside by the blue sign. Fine. She told me she couldn't seat me until my entire party of 2 was there. Fine. 

All that aside, my friend and I sat at the bar. She ordered pad kee mao and garlic shrimp. I didn't get to try some but they both smelled delicious. I got the massaman curry, which I've never had. The tamarind taste was overpowering. The Thai iced tea, although a little expensive, was really really good, it's like a better, spiced version of a bubble milk tea. I would definitely get it again. The khao soi looks good, so I'll try that...maybe at Nana (their sister restaurant) since they take reservations."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I went there and got a pad thai (pretty basic) and it was deeelicious!!!  I did, however, find that I was very thirsty after.  MSG?  Too salty?  I don't know but it was good while it lasted!  Definitely worth waiting at least to try once!"}
{"text":"The food is OK.  The 2 star review is for a terrible service experience.  Not sure what happened as it wasn't this bad the past time i went here.  In a half empty restaurant, we stood in the doorway waiting to be seated for a good 5-10 minutes as two different members of the service staff looked at us and made eye contact without any acknowledgement.  When finally one of them decided it was time to talk to us, we followed her in and around the corner only to be told by a different member of the staff rather curtly that we were supposed to wait around the corner for her to come get us. A little rude considering we were brought over by their staff and that we'd been standing there waiting for her to come and get us for at least 5 minutes.  

Following that, food was ordered and arrived on time.  The food was fine (as others here have said) but nothing to write home about.  Slight mixup on one of the orders (they gave us medium spicy on our papaya salad when we asked for mild - not a big deal)

But then the service continued to roll slowly downhill.  Small details like water not being refilled at all and then a bit of a ridiculous delay in waiting for the bill (as a huge lineup began to build at the entrance).  Judging by the other reviews, this seems to be a common experience. Usually this kind of stuff doesn't bother us too much, but the initial reception did not set a good first impression and so these things definitely are noticed after that."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot after finding it on reddit (heh heh heh...).

Me and my friend arrived at around 12:30, and we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table (lunch rush...). Eventually we sat at the bar.

Waiter was very attentive, considering he had to deal with everyone at the bar (about 10 or so people). He quickly served us drinks (though I only wanted water since I didn't want to drink something filling).

We ordered both kinds of Pad Thai, so we could see the difference between the two. Food took about 20 minutes to come, but seeing how there were so many people in the restaurant I guess I won't complain. Both of us took mild, as we can't take spicy stuff very well. Before we started eating, the waiter came over and asked if we wanted chopsticks. Yes, they offer chopsticks now!!! We gladly took them (who eats Pad Thai with a fork? Seriously).

The food itself was delicious and worth the wait and cost, although the street style was a little on the salty side (that's where they lost a star). We ended up trading each others' food to see how it tastes like, and the first one on the menu seemed spicier, less salty, and the fact peanuts were added.

Overall, I would visit again, though I kinda went out of my way to come to this place. Maybe if I were in the Financial District area in the future I'd consider stopping by again."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent ambiance and decor. Couldn't have asked for anything more (hey, that rhymes!).

I dined with a friend when it was relatively calm and uncrowded, so that could have been why our service was so fabulous. Our waiter was warm and knowledgeable, and the delicious dishes came quickly. You may think, since you're at a more authentic Thai restaurant, that you want to experiment and skip the typical Pad Thai... DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE! Their Pad Thai is like no other... It's just a wonderful, magical medley of tastes that I've never tasted before, and can't fully explain - nutty, spicy, wheaty, noodle-y goodness.

Be aware of their hours - during the week, I believe they close in the afternoon. It's also easy to miss... I walked right past it the first few times!"}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand. 

I've eaten authentic Thai food IN Bangkok and remote areas of Thailand.

Kaho San Road is right on par because their 2 chefs are from Cheng Mai.  The owners are friendly.

We had the rolls for appetizer.  Panang curry and pad thai.  All were very flavourful and delicious.

You can't go wrong here.

Atmosphere is great for a couple, a gathering or a family.

FanFukinTastic."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food.  Great flavor. Medium spicy had just the right amount of kick.  Had the Pad Thai (street), Yellow curry and a minced pork over rice.  All 3 dishes were worthy of a repeat order.  And it was plenty of food for 3 people.

Only criticism:  noise / reverb was loud and made conversation a bit of a strain."}
{"text":"After reading so many glowing reviews, I decided to check out Khao San Road. We arrived at around 1:30, thinking that it would be empty, on a weekday and it was still packed ! KSR doesn't take reservations so we waited for about ten minutes before we were seated (not bad). It was an interesting mix of people under one roof - the staff were all hipsters and patrons were either hipsters, students, suits or miscellaneous; the bestie and I fell into the last group. Now on to the food; the menu is large enough without overwhelming you and every dish is $15 or less. It's more expensive than other mom&pop Thai places and the food is okay (didn't love it, but didn't hate it as well). The Khao Soi was very creamy with heaps of beef chunks in it; it needed more noodles or rice. I also found '2' to be extremely spicy and I usually like spice. As for the service, it was hit or miss; our server kept forgetting things that we asked for and she also barely came to our table. The server in the section beside us though was on his a-game; we ended up asking him for more water and taking our photo. If I'm in the area, I might dine here again, but I won't go out of my way to travel here.

Good for: Thai"}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Not a huge selection but the food was still good. Service was excellent. Our orders came out pretty fast even though it was packed!!! Not a bad price point. It's a right to the point kind of place. They had one choice of dessert and it was a tapioca coconut thing. It was yummy.

If you don't know the exact address you won't be able to find it. There was no sign to see it from the street."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading good reviews about this place, I decided to try it.

I came here for dinner on a Friday night with my boyfriend. I was already anticipating a long wait in line because I was warned about this prior to getting there, plus, I read their extensive waitlist information on their website.

Anyhow, I got there at around 6pm, and already there were several people waiting ahead of me. I asked for a table for two and was told that it would take 20-25 minutes. We parked on the street near by so we waited there (it was a very cold evening by the way!). Finally, after 30 or so minutes, I receive a call and was told that there was a table ready for us. We go in, and we were told to go back outside because the table was not actually ready. Five minutes pass, and we finally got our table. In fact, we got to choose which table we wanted to sit at because several tables were being cleared at that time.

The hostess was friendly and very organized. The waiting staff were a bit nanchalant and did not really speak much.

We ordered the squash fritters as an appetizer, Chef's Pad Thai, and Khao Soi. The Pad Thai was nothing special. It was good, but again, it's Pad Thai. At least they didn't use any ketchup in the recipe.  The appetizer was delicious and crispy. The Khao Soi was so rich and creamy, almost TOO rich actually. We couldn't finish either main dishes and brought them home. It definitely made an awesome midnight snack and morning breakfast. :)

My main issue with the place is the wait time. I don't think that I would be willing to wait more than 30 minutes for this place.  Although the food is good and definitely better than the typical Thai restaurants you find around the city, I don't think it's really worth waiting more than half an hour."}
{"text":"What hasn't already been said about this place? This is the best Thai food I have ever had, and probably the best in the city.

The food is flavorful, fresh, and the spice level is customizable. The menu is not huge and that's a good thing. The focus is on doing it right. 

First time I went I had the Khao Soi on the advice of a friend. Amazing! A simple noodle and meat dish (beef or you can ask for chicken) but with an amazing curry base creamy soup that is to die for. To top it off you get crispy noodles on top that soften just a little when they soak in the broth. I want to drive down to the city right now for more.

On our latest trip we started with the cold rolls. Outstanding and made with home made chicken sausage inside and a spicy-tangy tamarind chili sauce for dipping. I had the three-flavour Pad Thai for my entree and it satisfied that noodle craving. So well balanced and authentic tamarind pad thai flavour. Did I mention the fresh roasted peanuts on top? So perfect. Being the gentleman that I am, I passed the Khao Soi tip on to my wife, who was experiencing Khao San Road for the first time.  Needless to say she was not disappoint!

Do yourself a favour and get down to Khao San Road soon. I'll see you there."}
{"text":"I went here to grab a quick bite while at a conference at the nearby Metro Toronto Convention Centre, in part because they had some gluten-free selections. I ordered pad thai to go. The waitress was fairly abrupt with me, as if I were wasting her time, but warned me that it would be a thirty minute wait. I asked if I could wait out front, and she said that no, I needed to come back in thirty minutes to see if the food was ready. I came back inside after fifteen, and this time she told me she'd bring it out to me when it was ready.

The pad thai was okay, but probably not worth the thirty-minute wait. People rave about this restaurant, but I found it to be just so-so, with few choices on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I can't live without their Pad Grao Prao... Beef is my favourite  not the best place to go wait for a table if you're really hungry though. I suggest going early or get there, put your names down and grab a drink until you're called! 

Worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"I had the Chef's Pad Thai. It was okay... It certainly did not live up to the expectations I was given."}
{"text":"A unique Thai experience unlike ur ordinary Thai express or salad king...the dish that I tried with like fried noodles in a bowl of curry was extremely flavorful and a dish that I nvr tried b4, I also recommend the fried squash as an appetizer...it's a little pricy as expect to spent at least 20 bucks...the reason this place got only 4 stars was because of the long ass wait that was about an hour and a half...tried to call for reservations but nobody picked up
All in all I would come back to this place only for special occasions"}
{"text":"KSR is back!! 

Fresh rolls! 

Panang Curry!

Pad Thai! 

Plus two Singha!  

Perfect!"}
{"text":"Went to this amazing Thai Restaurant! Sadly, two of the food pics went missing.... Don't know what happened to them....  So I'll just review the ones I have~

Gra Bong - Squash Fritters ($13.75+tax) was so nommy! Taste like potato fries but slightly healthier hehehe! The cripsiness was ON POINT! 

Chef Top's Massaman Curry ($16.95+tax) was MY FAVE dish!! We asked for mild spice, so it wasn't spicy at all! Their curry sauce was also on point! I couldn't stop eating this dish!! It was so flavourful!! I will come back for this!!!  

Overall, I would come back again to try other food! It is super busy tho! We had to wait upstairs at a bar for our seat. So far, my fave thai restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I know this place gets some amazing reviews but honestly, I got the pad thai and thought it was way too flavourful. Overpoweringly so. I felt like they needed to either add more veggies or noodles to even it out."}
{"text":"Khao San Road has the best thai food we have had in Toronto, it rivals the best thai we had in Thailand! 

3 of Our TOP Food choices here that you must order: 

PANANG CURRY - (curry) we get it with fish, but our friends love it with Chicken also, all their curries are delicious but this one takes the cake!

PAD SEE EW- (noodles) Amazing dish, we get this with Beef

PAD GRA PRAO -  (rice dish) we get this with beef"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to give this place a higher rating, so let me start with the good. The decor is vibrant and stylish, the music was bumpin', and the atmosphere was bustling. The food was great (had the khao soi and green curry fried rice), but I found both dishes EXTREMELY salty. The hostess was nice. 

Why is this place getting 3 stars then? It's the service. Our server seemed annoyed that he had to serve us. He was annoyed that we didn't know what food we wanted to order after 3 minutes of sitting down (mind you we waited 45 min for a table). We wanted to place our drink order first while we looked at the menu, but the server only put our drink order in once we put our food order in. No one checked to see how the food was once we were served. 

It's worth mentioning that I went to the bar upstairs while waiting for my table and the service there was terrible as well.

I'd suggest making the short walk over to Pai instead of this place if you want authentic Thai food in a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yay KSR is back and honestly did not disappoint. The new location offers more seating and the interior design of high ceiling and e colourful patterned tiled walls adds to the lively, fun ambiance. As per usual, expect to see a crowd congregated near the door waiting for seats as dinner time is always super packed. We got lucky and grabbed a spot at the communal high tables. Music was good, service was quick and the food was consistent with what I expected. We ordered the classics -  Khao Soi and the Bangkok style pad thai paired with of course .... Thai milk tea (my favourite) ! Overall, excited that KSR is back in action and as a side note, there is actually a bar on second level now called Bang Sue which offers cocktails and snacks which I look forward to trying out some time soon!"}
{"text":"The food at Khao San Road has always been stellar. It's why I keep coming back, despite the abysmal service. Whether you dine in or order take out, gird your loins for the glacial pace at which you will be served and the fact that no one working there seems to remotely care about the food or the service."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!  I completely agree that this is the best thai in Toronto.  

We arrived at about 8pm on a Wednesday, and had to wait for about 45 minutes, but as long as you steel yourself for the wait ahead of time, it's worth waiting for.  Once we were seated, service was prompt and the food was delish.  We had the squash fritters, green curry and pad thai, all were fresh, fragrant, and reminiscent of meals we had in Thailand.  

I also loved how attentive the owners were.  They are personable guys who checked with patrons to ensure we had an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Probably the best Thai restaurant i ever tried! Food is really Fatnastick. The menu is not that big, the choise is always the same every day, but they cook really really good food. Soup Tom Yum is the best we ever tried, One time it was too spicy but still delicious Pad thai is also great. Shrimps. Vegeteble spring rolls ..... i love tihs place and recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Food was 5 Stars...Am not ganna say less. 

However, We had to wait for like 30 min to go in. once we sit. The place was too busy, the tables is like 3 different couples in one table. I wasn't comfortable eating with others in the same table. 

What piss me off was the extra charge was on the bill, they think the you are to full and you just want to get out because of the noses and they add extra charges,,, You need to be careful with that..

1st order was SQUASH FRITTERS ($11) 

2nd The KHAO SOI ($14) \"Now\" here is the catch, it says its your choice of chicken, beef, tofu / Shrimp +$2 ... So i went (Chicken & Shrimp) .. so you are expecting $14 + $2 for the Shrimp.. while your guess is wrong. You will get charge of $2 for chicken and $2 for Shrimp.. SO ($18) 
  
3rd Red Curry ($14)  Same thing Chicken and Shrimp i was charged ($18)...

I asked the waitress why am paying extras for chickens . Her answer was \" While you asked for extra Shrimp RIGHT!!!!, And I told you is gonna cost you EXTRA!!!!\" I told her what about the Chicken she said \" While chicken and beef or whatever is all EXTRA\". 

Extremely rude!!!  

I would like to go back for the Food, but after the dealing with the waitress HUGE TURN OFF!!!!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended by one of my foodie friend. Space is small, lines are long and they don't accept reservations.  Located near King St. W/Spadina, far away place for me but I am glad I tried this place. 

There is an underground pay parking just beside the bldg. When we came out, we noticed line up. We were determined to eat here and after less than 5 minutes of putting our name with the wait staff, we were directed to go upstairs by the bar to wait to be called. After 30 minutes of waiting which seem like forever as we were all hungry by then, our table is ready, yey!!!

We had 2 large thai tea to share among 5 people as the glass is huge. I love the sweet, bitter taste!  Next came grabong and garlic shrimp. The grabong was done crispy and the sauce is the bomb! After having this, I am happy anticipating on the next dishes to come. Pad gra pao was so enticing, served with crispy egg on top, love the blend of adding the fish sauce on the ground meat. Phad thai taste really good as well. What stands out was the khao soi. We requested for little spicy and it was done just right. I love how there's only a little kick of spiciness. The sauce is very tasty and i love the mixture of noodle with crispy noodles. My favorite! Servings are big, we didn't get to finish everything and our server was kind enough to boxed it for us. 

Service is good and fast, place is clean. The only downside is the level of sound. Music is great but the volume is really very high makes it hard to hear each other. But with what I experienced tonight, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows I love Thai food! I have tried Thai food from various restaurants around Toronto and just had to try this restaurant out before leaving Toronto. My husband and I reached here early evening, just before 7pm and it was jam packed. There was a line up to get a table so we put our names on the list and headed upstairs for drinks while we waited. We waited for about 30 min before we got a call that our table was ready. We we're seated at a sharing table where 2-3 other groups were sitting already. After going through the menu we decided to order the zucchini fritters as a starter and follow that with three flavours pad thai and pad phed pha red curry. The food was absolutely amazing. The flavours of the dishes was pure perfection. Only downside is that all dishes were extremely heavy. However, we just packed up the leftovers and had it for lunch the next day. 
The restaurant is pretty small with nice decor. Bathrooms were not that impressive and need to be maintained better. The idea of sitting at a shared table is nice. We actually talked to the couple sitting right next to us and shared our food experiences, which was very nice. Another downside is that with the restaurant being so crowded, we did have problems getting hold of our server for the bill and ended up waiting for quite a while. 
Overall, a good experience but plan ahead and don't come here starving!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, its usually pretty time consuming to get a table though as there's no advance reservations. Lately I've been ordering for pick-up which has worked out well - would love to see a larger location someday that can easily accommodate the demand!"}
{"text":"From about a month ago went with my Dad, 

I'm was aghast with the way we were spoken to and treated by the hostess while leaving our names. She had had zero awesome points and through the roof douchbag finessse. Wtf!? The food, when we finally were summoned was just ok. Overall experience?disturbingly dumbfounding and disappointing. What has happened to this place and why is it still busy with people clamouring? I don't understand how this place is still the darling of so many people looking for south asian food. Please Khoa San road hostess go on and phuk yourself hard into the silent beautiful night. I will never eat here ever again. #mediocrity #overpricedfood #wtf #you'redoingitallwrong"}
{"text":"First off: get ready to wait 45 minutes to an hour.

That being said, totally worth it. (Which is what someone on the way out told us as well!)

We got lucky with seats at the end of one of the hightop tables, otherwise I think we may have been a tad uncomfortable. My husband ordered Thai iced tea and panang curry (level 3 spicy) with chicken, and I ordered the three flavours pad thai with chicken.  

His dish was too spicy for me (I'm a wuss), but he gobbled the whole thing up. =) My pad thai was heavenly with bits of tofu and ground peanuts scattered about. Great flavors, not too heavy, and I think our meals were each ~$14. 

Of course, we had to order the mango w/sticky rice. For the love of all that's holy, ORDER IT IF YOU GO. You won't regret it. It was a perfect size for the 2 of us to split (though I probably could've taken it on just fine by myself), the rice was in the shape of a heart (aw), and the mangos were perfection. 

Just like the lady said as we were waiting on a bench: It was totally worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and basically think that the food is slightly above average, but definitely on the spendy side.  They do get credit, however, for having a really decent vegan menu and for actually making the food hot.  The scene to get in, however, is kind of ridiculous, especially when it is cold out.  Luckily we were able to wait inside, but there were a whole lot of people waiting outside in line to put their names on the list. 

Last time we came we had the crispy rice salad, a papaya salad and the pad phed pha (pork).  The crispy rice salad was served cold, it was a little bit on the heavy side and it didn't have as much flavor or spice as it could have.  It also didn't come with lettuce leaves to wrap it in.  I was disappointed in this one.  The papaya salad was a salad version of it.  Not too sweet, and definitely not particularly fish saucy.  It had a nice flavor and was one of the better bargains for only $8.00.  The pad phed pha was kind of disappointing.  The meat had a decent flavor but on the rice it didn't really carry over and ended up just making the rice greasy instead of really flavorful.  I wouldn't order it again.

The atmosphere is hip and fun, but also a little crowded.  Overall, I'd come back if I was in the neighborhood and the wait isn't horrendous, but definitely not really special."}
{"text":"We waited about 2 hours on a Saturday night.  I was especially annoyed that the host was sitting other tables that came in later, before us.  It was not just one table or a large party.  The food was good but not that memorable.  Perhaps I am just spoiled by the abundance of thai food in Queens, NY.  But I had a good meal.  Nothing spectacular.  I would not rec waiting more than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"When you hear an overwhelming amount of hype about a restaurant, it's nice to visit and have all your expectations completely fulfilled. Couched in an absurdly small room, Khao San road is always packed with friendly people, delicious aromas, and delicious food. 

The greeter/hoster and owners have made me feel welcome every single time I have visited - even if the line ups were an hour long, and every seat filled. The taste of your food is always influenced by the atmosphere you're in, and the Khao San staff always go a little out of their way to make sure you feel at home. 

On a side note, the best way to circumvent the ridiculous wait times are to visit this place at lunch time. I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table for two at lunch. 

If you visit Khao San just for the main courses, you're missing out. Their garlic chicken app is almost mandatory, as is their \"Cha-Yen\" Thai Iced Tea (warning: it's terribly, awesomely, sweet). As for the main courses, it's a free for all between their various types of Pad Thai, their Khao Soi, and their daily curry specialty. 

Go in expecting long wait times and delicious food, and it'll be well worth it."}
{"text":"This is probably my 5th time at Khao San Road. I decided to bring my SO here to try their dishes since he has never had a decent Thai experience. They open at 5pm for dinner on Saturdays. When we arrived at 5:05 the restaurant was already filled with people. Couldn't believe it! I was seated at a table a few minutes later. I've always enjoyed their dishes every time I've been here. The portions are generous so I always have food left over. I based my 4 stars for these reasons:

Atmosphere: like the atmosphere. Pretty trendy and hip like what other reviewers have said. I don't like sitting in the front because you get squished like sardines with other people. When you're at a table it's nice. The music was good too. They played some 90s R&B hits. Heard maybe the same song 3 times but they switched it up to alternative rock which was a lot better. 

Service: Mediocre. Server came by, got us our water and drinks. Checked up on us a few times. Typical decent service you would get anywhere. 

Food: I ordered the Massamam Curry. It was my first time trying it. I usually have the Khao Soi but I felt like changing it up. I can't handle spice so I had mild and I thought it had a great flavor. Good amount of chicken (couldn't even finish it of course), lots of potatoes, peanuts and shallots. My SO doesn't usually like curry and he thought it was really good and said he would order this next time. He had the 3 flavor pad Thai. He thought it was pretty good compared to the other pad Thai he has had. He got number 3 spicy and we both thought it was really spicy for such a low scale. But I guess their spice scale did fool us! We also had the squash fritters which is always a delicious app to start with. 

Overall I haven't had a bad meal or experience at KSR so I'll definitely be back again. I would always recommend coming early because the wait is usually long if you come during dinner hours."}
{"text":"Best pad Thai in the city. Thai spicy blew me away after starting with the banging garlic shrimp. Definitely a must for any Thai food fan. Very hipster ambiance and efficient staff. The place is hopping, get there early or you'll be waiting in line."}
{"text":"We arrived and joined the waiting list. They asked for my phone number and a 20-minute wait.
They never called us. We returned after 20 minutes. They sit other people who arrived later than us. 
They requested another 30 more minutes.
It was frustrating."}
{"text":"You can even have the table by yourself unless your companies are here - lame

The stool seats are extremely uncomfortable and awkward - lame

The services is sub-standard - lame

Food is just like Pai - Pretty Good

Don't see any reason to go back, especially it is so close to Pai which is a lot better."}
{"text":"Hippest Thai spot I have been to.  

Limited seating inside. Very crowded at lunch. Ordered to go and took about 30 minutes to make. 

Pad Thai Sam Roas, chicken - $12 - Had all the normal Pad Thai ingredients but there was something that changed up that gave it a unique flavor. Lunch portion was pretty big. 

Pad See Ew - $12 - Good Pad See Ew. Was everything I expected and wanted."}
{"text":"The daily curry at lunchtime is excellent -- it has a silky creaminess to it which I've never experienced elsewhere. Minimal options -- it's either chicken or veggie for this dish -- but frankly, it doesn't matter because it's great. I'm definitely going back to try some of the other dishes...."}
{"text":"I hope you're not claustrophobic.  I'm a tourist from NYC and I can't figure out why there's always a pandemonium at this joint every day and night.  Where I come from, these flavors are pretty much the norm.  I guess Canadians never had such flavors, I'll never know...

I've never quite experienced such average food in such jam packed place with such great noise level.  I hate when people are too close to me where they can hear my conversation.  It's like sitting next to an annoying stranger in a tight subway cart.  No thanks.  At approximately 6:15pm, this place turns into a zoo and the BATTLE OF WHO CAN TALK THE LOUDEST commences.  Just sitting there hearing their stupid conversation made me very annoyed.  Especially when the person won't stop looking over at you.

Previous yelper mentioned how the khao soi tasted like Hot Golden Curry and coconut milk.  HAHAHAHA. Funny because that's actually true.

The only bold move this place does is season the food right and is not afraid to pack on heat.  Hint: lots of MSG in that fish sauce & those tiny fermented shrimps.

Not sure if you've noticed but their heat level goes from 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11.  I tried to order level 6 (Thai spicy) and the waitress didn't recommend it for me.  Hmm, then why even have 8 or for heaven's sake, 11?  Unless they wanna put somebody in a hospital!  So, reluctantly, I had to settle for 3.  But holy cow, even level 3 was pretty spicy!  I can't imagine what 6 must've tasted like.  That's why there's the disclaimer saying once you go hot, you can't go bok.  I almost choked when the chilis went down the wrong pipe, I swear I thought I was gonna die, my eyes welled up with tears and my throat felt like hell on fire.  My fault.

The garlic chicken is SUPER garlicky by the way.  So don't order this when you wanna get your sexy on afterwards on a first date.  Otherwise, it was fried to crisp and served with a nice fishy vinegary dipping sauce.  

I ordered the tofu pad thai and I guess if you're a vegan or a vegetarian, you must warn them first because it had tiny fermented shrimps and fish sauce in it.  

Thai iced tea was like any other standard Thai iced tea anywhere else.  And when you're finished, you pay by the register down by the restroom area.  Restroom was a little smelly, super super tight stalls (you know, where your face hits the door when you try to crouch), and unkept with paper garbage overflowing and all over the floor.  Yuck.

I wouldn't come again.  I hate tight communal tables (unless I'm hitting on a guy) and it was too loud for my enjoyment.  But if you enjoy dining in super tight space and like to eavesdrop with a little bit of MSG love, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Totally worth the hype. 

Well run, well designed, well executed, wonderful restaurant. Most importantly of course, the food is fantastic! A new spin on what you think pad thai tastes like. Sweet, savoury, spicy - mmmmmmmmm. The curries are also top of the line tasty.

Service is efficient - everything about this place is efficient. The line up is daunting but they know what they're doing and it's worth the wait. If you're willing to sit at the perfectly comfortable bar or share a stool at the wood communal tables, you'll be eating in no time. 

A small space that is perfectly packed with well laid out tables and bar, they make use of every inch of it and despite the always busy place, you don't feel crowded.

A small but tasty wine list, I had a nice glass for $9. A traditional Thai beer and some delicious teas make a nice accompaniment to your meal. I can't wait to try more dishes from here. 

Note that they are only open for a limited window for lunch so be prepared to wait but go with enough time to enjoy your meal! 11:30-2:30 and then they close up to turn around and prep for dinner service starting at 5:00pm - 10:00pm.

I love that they offer take out and I plan on taking out soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Toronto! Like many others, love the khao soi. The squash fritters are also amazing. I constantly crave their only dessert item (its this warm coconut milk/tapioca soupy thing- sounds a bit weird but it is so creamy, sweet, and delicious). Honestly everything I have ever ordered there is great. 

Only drawback is that it's not exactly the place to go if you are looking to have a slow, relaxed, dinner with an old friend. I always feel a bit rushed there, and the music is always really loud (and awesome! 90's beats!). I love it, but the ambiance may not be for everyone."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai and curries in town! Fresh products, service is ok that s just why I dont put 5 stars."}
{"text":"I read about this place being one of the best restaurants in Toronto.
Since I was in town on business, I had to check it out.
Arrived at 5:30 (just me) and was given a backless stool at the counter. Wasn't too happy about that but I wanted to try it out.
I didn't order much besides a glass of wine and their chef's signature Pad Thai.
My opinion--meh. Although tasty, it was quite oily and I definitely have eaten better Pad Thai elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came and tried the new Khao San Road and I'm happy to say its as good as ever! We had to wait for about 30 minutes for a table to be free but they have a really great bar upstairs with a bunch of beers, cocktails and snacks available so the time flew by. Once we were seated we were promptly greeted by our server and food was quick to come out. We had the green curry and pad thai and both were excellent! Honestly just as good if not better then a lot of what I had in Thailand! Tables were close together and the music was loud but I think it just added to that Thai resto feel! I will definitely be coming back for more and to try the food upstairs! 5 STARS"}
{"text":"This is another restaurant that I went to because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I had a noodle dish and it wasn't that great. It was different, but not worth waiting an hour for. Personally, I think Khao San Road is overrated."}
{"text":"Not exactly the comfiest place to eat, but totally worth the overlook. Also super busy, so show up early or prepare to be patient. 

Really. Great. Food. And the alternative menu for vegans is amazing. Basically everything on the regular menu, but with a super thoughtful substitutes so anyone can enjoy. Never having been to Thailand, I won't speak to authenticity, but I'm not sure that's always necessary if it's well done food! 

The Thai iced tea was super tasty, and we had panang/green curries and the pad see ew. Everything was fresh, delicious, and the portion sizes were perfect. Prices are totally reasonable, and the staff was lovely. One of those places I do think is worth the hype :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly service.  Be prepared to wait if you go at a busy time.  We just go early and put our name down, or try to go on an off time.
The khao soi with beef is my favorite dish, and I get it almost every time.  The thai iced tea is like a delicious dessert."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai.

I had this restaurant on my Toronto short list for a few years, and my boyfriend and I finally decided to make our way out to the restaurant on our second trip to the city together. The entrance is pretty cool with a light blue neon script sign and a full view of the small restaurant a half-level below. The wait can sometimes be crazy on weekend nights, but they do a pretty good job of taking names and phone numbers and calling you when you're ready.

The setup is very social, with a few long communal tables in the front as well as a dining room and bar. The ambiance is very lively and fun, and the servers are all quick but friendly. They have a nice, short selection of wines and starters. The vinho verde is my personal favorite! I couldn't tell you what the noodle dishes are like since I could never tear myself away from their curry dishes. Their red and panang curries are phenomenal, managing to pack amazing flavor into a thin coconut milk base that tastes light and fresh! This place serves such a wonderful experience that it's no longer a trip to Toronto without a stop here!"}
{"text":"I think Khao San Road may be a victim of it's own success. We came here specifically because it was rated so well on yelp and were disappointed mostly because it didn't live up to the hype.

We went on a Monday night and still had to wait 35 minutes for a table. The server/service was inattentive. Since I wasn't sure how spicy to get my food, our waitress offered to bring extra chiles with my dish. These didn't come with my dish and I was unsuccessful in flagging down any staff member for several minutes.

I thought the food was good but it wasn't the best Thai food I've ever had. I thought the quality of the ingredients was quite high compared to most other Thai restaurants in Toronto.

I wouldn't suggest going here. The service was lacklustre and the food wasn't worth the long wait."}
{"text":"Panang was amazing. Ambiance is cool. Wait wasn't so bad on a Sunday night. Price is on point. Will be back"}
{"text":"Definitely five stars! So glad my girlfriend made us come here. The food was seriously some of the best Thai I have had. The Thai bucket was also a fun drink but share it with a friend at the bar. If you visit Toronto go here!"}
{"text":"I lived in Bangkok for four years and know Thai food as well as anyone. Khao San Road is *absolutely* authentic Thai in every way and I've been looking for a place as good as this for 10 years. The wait staff are all mostly younger Thais and have that endearing and unique Thai friendliness and hospitality. The seating is very basic and communal, which contributes to the sense of Thai community (as well as gives the owner higher density.) 

They've managed to find all the little Thai ingredients that give Thai food in Thailand its special appeal, and that's the taste I've been unable to find. I think it's a smart idea to have a very limited menu because the chefs are able to turn around the food quickly, and there's enough on there to keep each visit a little different. I can't believe they had Khao Soi from the Isaan province in northern Thailand--I've only ever found that in Thailand (and it's wonderful.)"}
{"text":"This is one of the most delicious places in Toronto. I went here for my birthday dinner last year, as well for my last day at work a while back. I've been to this place multiple times in the same week.

They make the best pad thai I have ever tasted. The chef special (Sam Roas) version is worth it! I am also addicted to their Khao Soi dish, and I recommend it with the beef. It is a delicious coconut curry, the chunks of beef are huge, and the crispy egg noodles are divine and add some crunch. I have tried making the dish at home because I was so inspired.

Sadly (though good for them) this place is quite popular and gets very busy. I would recommend getting the khao soi or curry of the day at lunch if you are in a hurry. They can whip up both of those dishes for you quickly, as Im sure they just make a huge pot of both curries. The curry of the day is also only 8 bucks."}
{"text":"Easily if not THE best Pad Thai I ever ate. Authentic and exploding with the exact flavours I've been looking for. It's not overly exaggerated with sauce...which is the way it should be. Service was excellent and fast as well. My friend decided not to go with the pad thai and ordered the rice dish and also enjoyed it very much...but the Pad Thai is definitely the first choice in this place."}
{"text":"TIP:  Restaurant is very loud.  You can hear from across the table, unlike Pai, but music (all genres) are constantly blasting over the speakers.

Same hype/crowd different location.  I found the newly opened KSR just alright.

Was it worth lining up for 30mins, then waiting another 30mins for the food, absolutely not!  Is the food tasty?  Yes, you're also paying a premium, a few dollars more than other just-as-good Thai places!

I arrived around 7:30pm on a Thursday, was told the wait would be approx. 45mins by the friendly hostess, and we were seated at the 30min mark, orders taken shortly thereafter, but food took approx. another 30mins.  

Place is rammed jammed at the front vestibule with patrons waiting for a table, then crammed on small and larger communal tables, both regular height and taller bar stools.  \"Bar\" where non-alcoholic drinks are prepped, leftovers are put in boxes, and empty plates are brought also serves as a seating area.  And that's where I was seated.  

I saw one of the servers preparing the mango drinks and it was literally a tall glass, scooped up full of ice cubes with a mango juice from a tetra pack, then topping it off with some evaporated milk.  That's it.  

Khao Soi ($16) was primarily a curry soup and there wasn't that much noodles.  I was able to reconstruct it into another noodle dish with the leftover soup with pieces of chicken.  Pad Gra Prao ($16) was served on a large plate, sorta spread out to look like a bigger portion, but I finished the entire thing.  It was good.  Maybe my appetite was just worked up with all the waiting.

Overall, if you like being in \"happening\" places, have the time to wait, then food-wise, Khao San Road isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"I started with a cold chicken spring roll. Tasty, but too much of one thing. Then I had the Bangkok Style Pad Thai. Delicious! Service was quick. I went alone just before opening, so, got a seat. At noon on a Wednesday, it was packed. Big lineup. Much too \"rocking\" for my taste; loud people, loud music. Won't be back, but I recommend for duos, partiers."}
{"text":"Yup my favourite Thai restaurant is back!!! Yay!!!!!
And I celebrated women's day here. And it is as great as it always was, when I used to visit old Khao SanRoad.

The blast of flavours with a whole independent vegan menu to choose from. Every dish better than other.

This time I ordered Vegan Panang Curry. When I took the first bite, I realised , how much I missed Khao San over the last year. 

I love the new full bar upstairs, with a variety of craft beers, cocktails and starters to compliment drinks. The bar is as big as restaurant downstairs and romantic.

Well back to food- pad grao and pad thai are my favourite other the panang curry, I also love their squash fritters and tapioca pudding.. yummm yummm yummm... My visit is incomplete without Thai Iced Tea. Tried all over Toronto, they know how to make the best one.

Warning to all Thai food places: the boss is back! I am not going anywhere else now, of course until they kick me out. Hahahha 

Bad thing- they still dont take reservations, but atleast they made a bar, so instead of lining up, you can have a drink while your table is being set !"}
{"text":"amazing food and dont beleive the people who gave this restaurant anything less than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long wait- but know your wait will be rewarded with a wonderful meal. We started with a papaya salad- stick with the average spiciness- we went spicy and it was too spicy but still flavorful. We also had their fried tofu, shrimp pad thai and their curried chicken rice. Everything was so good!!"}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of thai food in Toronto (Pai, Sukho Thai, you name it!) I was excited of their new location and the space and the food that they would offer. I was not very pleased with the service they provided as we walked-in with no reservation and they were unable to take down our names until 15 minutes later. The hostess was continually walking around doing busboy duties while there was a crowd forming just waiting to give her a name so that we could be seated.

We ordered khao soi (my favourite dish), the green curry and thai iced teas. The portions have gotten smaller unfortunately but keeping with the same price. The green curry was very watered down and did not taste very good, in comparison with the Khao Soi. It was 7pm when we sat down for dinner and they ran out of the beef for the Khao Soi already, which is very disappointing. The restaurant shoudl have been able to predict their daily orders of food better. It was only 7pm.

Probably wont be coming back as I am happier with Pai and Sukho Thai."}
{"text":"I frankly feel this restaurant is overrated. The food quality is definitely good each time I ate here but the service and the long wait doesn't make it worth the time for me. For lunch, it is so difficult to place a take out order. They seldom answer their phone and I am pretty sure they are losing business due to this (it's probably their way of throttling volume which is a good problem to have from their perspective). I usually get the chef's special pad thai but of late I don't find it anything special. I did the combo upgrade with soup and spring rolls and that makes for a good hearty lunch. I think Sabai Sabai serves equally good food minus the long wait which makes it more appealing to me. Unfortunately, my office location has moved closer to Khao San hence my frustration with their lunch ordering process. Be sure to get in by 11:30 (right when they open), otherwise expect a long wait."}
{"text":"the food here is remarkable! the flavour of thai food is amazing. had curry green rice which was delicious but what was much more tasty was the kao san soi which instead of noodle we changed it to rice. the iced tea was also good, but too much ice in my opinion that was much like a chinese milk tea with a different sweet flavour. for appetizer we ordered squash fritters that  i would defnitely come back for.  

the big bummer was the enormous ridiculous line to get in! which for me was frustrating to wait so long considering we placed ourselves on the waiting list, went to park the car, shopped on queen, and STILL had to wait (actually when we got  to the restaurant we were immediately offered the bar area - but opted to wait for a proper table).

highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked into the restaurant the smell had us drooling. Everything was amazing from the service to the food.
Our sever was polite and when we asked her what was the best items of the menu (it was out first visit), she told is one from every selection. We took her advice and ordered everything that was recommended. Delicious-- I know where I will be for lunch, as well as recommending it to all of my friends and family!"}
{"text":"This place is no bueno. The wait is too long for mediocre Thai food and it is way too expensive. My husband and I also had bad tummies during the night and the day after."}
{"text":"Waited few minutes for table. This place is alright. Nothing great. Pai is better. Nothing great tonworte about food or service. Average place"}
{"text":"A Pad thai that delicious deserves 5 stars regardless of ambience or service. 

The loud music and upbeat atmosphere certainly woke me up on a Friday night, but when I had the first bite of their Vegan Pad Thai it literally lifted me off the ground. 

DELICOIUS!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what the hype is about this place. Went there for lunch for a coworker's birthday, and it was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Hostess was rude and condescending, even to the point of threatening we won't be seated despite our reservation. Server was inattentive and we had to ask for water 4 times before any was brought to us. Food took an hour to get here and for the price, it's definitely not worth it. After only 15 minutes with the food the server rudely slapped the bill onto our table as a sign for us to leave, despite most of us not even half way through our meal. We decided to just take the rest to go, but apparently getting containers was too much of a hassle for our server, who just ignored us and brought the machine over instead for us to pay. We asked for the bill to be split (as we were paying for the birthday girl) and received such backlash from the server I was shocked he even has a job in customer service. To top it all off, an 18% gratuity was already added to our bill, despite us only being 6 people, and the terrible service we received. I definitely would not recommend this place, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's so much nicer than the actual Khao San Road in Thailand you guys.

Packed out, but the wait was still just ten minutes!  Quality food, quick and easy atmosphere.  
The braised beef in the yellow curry noodle soup was unreal--I will seriously dream about it.
I don't imagine that I'll be here again anytime soon...and I'll miss Khao San the most."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed by this place. Considering the price, and given that it is supposed to be one of the better Thai places in Toronto, I expected more. I ordered the chicken panang and the serving size was not great, and the flavour did not stand out to me at all."}
{"text":"Had the Khao soi with shrimp and it was filled with amazing flavors. I had some great Thai food in my life and this one is at or near the top. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Always thought of going here and finally made it.. Incredibly busy but now I know why.. The food is really good.. We had the panang curry, garlic chicken and pad Thai.. Best I've had till date.. Strongly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"I have had Thai at many places but this one takes the Cake. Khao Soi is what I ordered and man how well it was made. 
It just made my day."}
{"text":"This is Thai food like you'd imagine it would be in Utopia! Upbeat music, quick service (once seated, there's always a wait), yummy goodness all around. Very authentic, taste buds were tantalized tummy was singing praise and my fellow diners were in cloud 9! The Thai ice tea is decadent and oh so good!
It was my first time at the new place and they did not disappoint"}
{"text":"I'll be honest off the bat. I didn't go to Khao San Road.

I ordered from there for a corporate event. O....M.....G. 

The meal I ordered for about 30 people was well worth it and my co-workers can't wait for us to order from there again. The Pad Thai was phenomenal and the Green Thai Curry was off the hook!

My only issue was dealing with the restaurant that doesn't usually deliver food wasn't in communication a lot until the last minute so I didn't know if I had to order from somewhere else instead.

HOWEVER, the staff were friendly, and really helpful. I tipped in full and I can't wait to eat their food again!"}
{"text":"They don't take resos which is the most annoying part about eating here. Waited for 45 minutes or so, but apparently thats not a bad wait... 

The squash fritters are good, but better to be shared with more than two people. By the end of it, we were getting pretty sick of it because the portion is so big. The khao soi is amazing and one of my favorites and definitely worth getting. The pad gra prao is also amazing and feels like a very homely dish. Everything here is very well seasoned and has great flavor."}
{"text":"Have come here several times over the years, but the food is not the same anymore now that Chef Nuit is not there, and now that Chef Nuit and Jeff do not have a stake in the restaurant anymore! 

Further, not taking reservations anymore makes for very long waits! 

We find that they cannot accommodate large groups very well-- at our last visit, the hostess was quite rude in refusing to seat us, despite the fact that 6 people out of our 8 person party were present. Which is, of course her call, as it is their policy to not seat parties unless the full party is there; however she was very rude and combative about this, considering that we had been waiting an hour for a table. 

We informed her that the 2 remaining people in our party would be arriving very shortly. The table had already been set for 8 and could easily accommodate that many.  

She chose to remove 2 place settings and very rudely told us that we could eat as 6, and that when the remaining 2 people got there, they would have to sit separately. Or that we could wait another hour for all 8 of us to eat together. We chose to leave instead, and we will not be going back. 

The fact is that when it comes to Thai in Toronto, Khao San is a has-been. Currently, SukhoThai is much better, and so is Pai (Pai is right down the street, and we have found the food there is what Khao San used to be). They also have a nice little waiting area in which you can sit and have drinks while waiting for a table or for your friends to arrive, instead of waiting out on the street in the rain or snow!"}
{"text":"After coming here with my friend I didn't really get the hype for the food - sure, the Thai iced tea is out of this world. But the food? It's just okay.

My friend and I got here pretty late and we waited for a server for ~10-15 minutes. The place has a really hip vibe going on and I liked the look of the tiles on the wall.

I got the 3 flavour pad Thai and Thai iced tea. The drinks came quickly but food took another 15-20 minute wait because of the high volume of people inside.

The drinks were a lot bigger than I would have imagined, but the tea was so good. I didn't really find the pad Thai to be mind-blowingly good... just oily noodles that I found to be too sweet. The portion was also really really big, enough for two people.

Their music is also really loud. My friend and I were sitting at the bar right next to each other and we had to repeat ourselves often.

Wouldn't really recommend it unless you're coming here for the bar upstairs (Bang Sue Bar) which is a nice bar/snack place."}
{"text":"Mehhh. Not sure what all the rave is about. Service was ok. No one ever asked me if I liked my food. The actual temperature was room temperature and could have been a little hotter. Hostess was especially nice and efficient with the long lines but the food was status quo Thai food. Maybe Seattle just has above average Thai. I had the much reviewed khao soi, medium spice (average), and found the spice flavorful, leaving a little heat behind with each bite. All and all I didn't find myself nodding with enjoyment saying mmmmmm."}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand, (in particular Chang Mai, which is known for the food) for a short period of time, so I have to admit I can be really picky when it comes to Thai food. However, Khao San Road is hands down the best Thai Restaurant in Toronto, and has some of the best Thai food I have EVER eaten, including Thailand. The owner actually owns a restaurant in Pai (Northern Thailand), so they are authentic when it comes to Thai Food. 

I love that they don't have a 16 page menu trying to do every Asian dish under the sun (like a lot of places do), Khao San Road has a small menu doing what they know best. They stick to their best recipes and source fresh local food. My favourite dish is Pad Kee Mao, followed by Chef's Special Pad Thai, and the curries are also delicious. And if you like spicy make sure to ask for it, and they will deliver! They are not scared of chilis.

The decor is fabulous, it's brightly lit, with communal tables, has a trendy vibe with beautiful modern furniture, and they have a large chalk board that has thai phrases for people to learn. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is a lot of fun. 

You will wait in line to eat here, but it's worth it! NOTE: Now open Sunday!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time, I had the vegan Pad Thai which was just okay... Most recently I had the vegan green curry. It was delicious! Mild was just enough heat for me since the dish contains green chillies. We also tried the vegan version of the squash fritters which were enjoyable as well.

I will definitely be back to try the red curry."}
{"text":"Excellent thai food that makes up for the crowdedness and wait to get in. Good level of spice selection."}
{"text":"As I made my way to this place, I thought that the exterior did not look like it was a restaurant, looked more like an office building. 

The restaurant was not busy at all during lunch. Its a very modern take on a Thai restaurant. There are options to sit either at the bar (chairs with backs) or at tables (chairs without backs) on the high stools. It is quite clean although, I didn't particularly like the exit doors. They are not friendly at all. The entire restaurant gives a nice view of an L shaped due to its glass architecture.

We waited for about 20 minutes before food was brought to us. The menu is quite simple and does not have lots of options which is refreshing. It averages on price for lunch in the downtown core. Portions are alittle on the smaller end though. 

Waitress service was efficient from the time we got there to leaving. I would have appreciated a straw with my water though. I paid with a credit card. 

I ordered the Pad Thai with a level 6 Spicy. It was the highest level. This is not for the faint of heart as a seasoned spice eater like myself was having a little bit of a rough time. It was hot. I guess that's why they serve bean sprouts on the side - to cool your mouth down. It also came with a lime wedge. 

My dish was alright. Nothing too exciting about it except the small dried shrimp which were a surprise. The tofu were so tiny, small pieces scattered in the dish. I saw no trace of eggs as well. There were however, good amounts of chicken. I probably would not order it again though. It costs $14.50. 

Overall, I would visit this restaurant again to try other foods on the menu."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant; the food was good, staff was friendly, and place was lively. However, the place is very busy during dinner time (6:40pm) and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table so make sure you arrive early to put your name down (no reservations). I ordered the massaman curry, my gf ordered the pad thai and we both got Thai iced teas. 

Curry: Very flavourful and shrimp was meaty. Potato balls could be softer. 

Pad Thai: Broccoli was done well - crunchy and not too tough/soft. 

Thai Iced Tea: I recommend this. Its different from other milk teas (Taiwanese/hk/Vietnamese) that I'm used to but it's different in a good way. The color is also very orangey so that's kind of cool."}
{"text":"Very authentic Thai food. Love it, just very crowded."}
{"text":"My TIFF caveat: Short and sweet reviews!

Spicy is definitely spicy here... but the food tasted fresh and yummy and prices are decent."}
{"text":"The food here tastes a bit strong for my taste. The pad thai is a little too sweet and becomes hard to eat after a while, same with the khao soi. I recommend buying some appetizers or drinks to give yourself a break in between bites... the thai iced tea is really good.

I usually get the pad gra prao with the fried egg when ordering for take-out, it's pretty good. It also tastes a bit strong/rich/whatever but the egg and rice mellows it out a bit.

Insanely busy."}
{"text":"We came here in a group of 5 on a Saturday night around 9:00 pm and was told the wait was about 40 mins. Went to a bar around the corner and they called us right around the 35 min mark. 

Starving as we were, we ended up ordering a bunch of stuff. The highlight of the meal was the beef pad gra prao - stir fried minced meat with holy basil.  The khao soi was pretty good as well. The curries were a let down. We ordered red, green and penang curries - all of which tasted watered down, sweet and geared towards the western palette, losing much of its authenticity in the process. The biggest disappointment for me had to be the tom yum soup. It tasted nothing like the real thing. 

I was curious to try Thai food in Toronto because in NY, although Thai restaurants are a dime a dozen, there are very few good ones. I wasn't overly impressed with KSR, but the pad gra prao and khao soi were good (especially when drinking) and worth checking out."}
{"text":"We knew there was going to be a wait, but we had time to kill and finally took the plunge to queue up for Khao San Road. The wait ended up not being as bad as expected - the guy running the door was doing a good job keeping track of people and managing expectations, and when more that one group in front of us didn't have their full party together of just disappeared, we were seated at the bar after 15 minutes, not the 40 we were quote.

We started with the Gra Bong (squash fritters) and some bottles of Singha. The fritters were fantastic, thinly cut to ensure even cooking. A great start. She had the chef's special Pad Thai and I had the Pad Phed Pha. Both were excellent, with the Pad Phed Pha having a great mix of flavours. Both of us ordered our entrees spicy, and it may have been a bit too spicy for me and I'm usually a fan of spiciness. We were expected chopsticks, not western cutlery, but no big deal there. The portions were a good size and we both ended up taking leftovers home.

My only real complaint - the men's washroom had standing water on the floor. Gross. I haven't seen anyone else mention it in their reviews and hope it was a one-time occurrence."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai food coupled with fast and efficient service. I wholeheartedly recommend coming here for either lunch or dinner.

The restaurant gets extremely busy.  We arrived precisely 4:55 pm and were allowed in for the opening, which is normally at 5:00.  Good thing too, because there was a line for tables by 5:30, despite the torrential rain.  Either come early or be prepared for a wait.

I had the crispy garlic chicken and squash fritters for appetizers. The dishes were accompanied by tangy sauces for dipping.  Both were quickly devoured at the table.

For dinner, I enjoyed the Khao Soi, a curry dish with braised beef (you can also choose chicken) and topped with crispy noodles.  It was perfect - just spicy enough but also very flavorful.

My dining companions ordered curry with chicken, curry with shrimp and the Pad Thai.  All were excellent.

I will certainly make a point of returning here for dinner the next time I am in Toronto.  In a city with countless Thai restaurants, Khao San Road stands out as exceptional."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. This restaurant is one of the known places in downtown Toronto for Thai food but I feel like its been overrated. Food here is decent but not the best. I was expecting more from such a high rated restaurant. Customer Service is horrible. You'll spend most of your time waiting for the bill...

I've tried the 3 flavour pad Thai with beef here. The pad Thai was extremely sweet. They overdosed on too much sauce. The beef was really tough. It smelt really good but flavour wise the flavour was not much different from any other Thai place. 

I also tried the red curry here. I'm not sure if the curry was supposed to be that watery. But it was like liquid. I just expected the consistency to be a little thicker like other places. Flavour wasn't as strong either and a little on the sweeter side. There was little chicken and it was dry. As for the rice, the rice was undercooked and really hard even when you soak it in the curry.  

Lastly, the Thai iced tea is really good. The drink was thick and strong. Full of tea flavour. 

Note: if you order the drink with no ice, they give you a smaller cup. 

Overall, food was not worth the wait. Decent but could do better. 

As for customer service it is horrible. Waiting for a table took a while, then waiting for food, then waiting for the bill. The bill took like 20 minutes to come. I had my credit card out and ready to pay already and the waiter just gives me the bill and walks away to do other stuff. She could clearly tell I was ready to pay too.... like really? I was standing up, all packed and everything too. Didn't cash me out until another 10 minutes. 

Now I see why there's always a wait. Because the waiters drag time when cashing out the bills.


P.S. There's a bar upstairs while you wait. They serve different appetizers and drinks. We tried the skewer, they were delicious. The pork skewer, the meat was tender and juicy. The chicken skewers was not overcooked and also really juicy and flavourful. This apparently was made by a different chef. The flavours of the food were strong and not as sweet as downstairs."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the wait is always hit and miss (either absurdly long or not so bad), but worth it. And they will give you a call/text when your table is ready so you can go for a drink while waiting which is nice! I love that they have vegan options! The food is tasty, a little pricey for thai, but I would keep going for the quality! The appetizer of fried onions is delicious & big!! The pad thai is a traditional pad thai, the green curry is great over rice or even mixed together with the pad thai.  My only negative is we ordered a bottle or Chardonnay and it was $50!! Which I thought was a bit extreme but otherwise a good experience overall!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to come here after work and I've heard good things from my other friends, so here we are. After we arrived at the place, there was already a lineup, typical for a downtown joint at dinner time. I went up to ask if I can put my name down, the hostess said that I have to stand in the line till she gets to me. Mind you this is just to get my name on the list. So after waiting for about 20 minutes with the line not moving, I decided to just get take out. After placing the order I was told it'll be about 30 minutes wait, I thought  we could have a beer at the bar while we wait. Nope, can't do that, I must wait outside for the food. After getting beer from a near by pub, I came back to get my food, and was told it was not ready, after another 15 minutes wait, it was ready. 

So after this long rant, here comes the food part. First of all we got the garlic chicken to share, it was decent, nothing to rave about, fried chicken tenders with dipping sauce. My gf got the green curry, it was pretty good, very nice favor, and goof soup, although there wasn't that much chicken in it. I got the Pat Thai with beef, it was decent, nothing special, the portions was very filling. 

So over all experience. I feel the amount of time I have to wait and the hoops that I have to jump through was not worth the price and the taste it offered. They might at one point been a great place, sadly it was not on display today. There are many great Thai place across Toronto, and I would only come back if I'm in the area and there is no line. The service need to improve, I am not picky and willing to wait, however waiting to getting on to the waiting list, and no service for beer because I got takeout is just weird. Hope it improves in the future, and if it does, I'll change my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Really trendy and chill place.
Their wait staff are all friendly and really helpful. Food is great. Pad Thai, curry, Thai Iced Tea, all amazing. If I lived in the area, I'd probably come here to eat. 

However, I'm not sure if this particular waitress cracked under pressure or just didn't know what she was doing. I returned a second time just to get two Thai Iced Teas to go (with no ice since it was freezing out) and she handed me two half full cups. I told her I ordered it two nights ago and it was filled up. She was so busy worrying about everything else except for us, she shooed us away and said there was nothing she could do. When I tried to get her attention she went to help a table. 

We combined the \"two\" iced teas to BARELY make one cup... $10. Seriously I left so annoyed. Because I'm sure if we were a stay in order and ordered the iced teas with no ice, she wouldn't hand me two half full glasses. If I'm paying $10 for a drink it better have some alcohol content and not be half empty. 

I like this place, but for every bad experience it makes you think twice. 
So... I'll decide when I visit again."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, although there was an unusually long wait. Once we stood in line for what felt like forever, we put our name in, and then waited some more. We went upstairs for some cocktails (we ordered the fried rice up there, which was HEAVENLY). Also the couple right behind us also went upstairs for a cocktail. 

After about 40 minutes, I was surprised that the couple who arrived right behind us got a call from downstairs telling them their table was ready. That's weird, right?

So I went downstairs to very nicely check on our seat. Sure enough, I could see the hostess's list, and she had just skipped our name. Really?

Anyway, we got our table. The service was nice. The food was better than average, but not amazing (the fried rice at the bar upstairs, however, was FANTASTIC -- like I've never had fried rice that tasted so good in my whole long life). 

Also, this place has an embarrassingly poor drinks menu. They run the bar upstairs, but you can't order any of the drinks from there (or any cocktails AT ALL) and you only get one selection of a wine or a beer. Truly bizarre.

So if you're going to go, I guess make sure there's a long wait so you can get some of that delicious fried rice upstairs."}
{"text":"Ok really really good food but not the best. I was lucky to beat the crowd on a Friday night and got seated in 20 mins. Saw some people still waiting when we left. Had the Thai iced tea, good but too sweet for me. Street Pad Thai was amazing but my wife found it too spicy, just right for me. Red curry fish was also quite good but I've had better in Mississauga. You can tell it's all fresh and made how it's suppose to be. I also like that the employees were actually Thai, felt almost like you're in Thailand. Will be back if in the area but not driving from the burbs just for it."}
{"text":"I ended up going here with a friend who was eager to try out this hotspot and go to a place that's a little more trendy, let's say I wasn't too thrilled on the experience.

We got there at 7pm and ended up waiting about 30min to be seated by a rude hostess who was aggressive with some of the other people waiting outside. In total during our wait, I watched about 18 covers walk away to find other places.  Once inside things picked up a bit and the waitress was prompt and attentive with the starters. It's very loud in here, between the 80's classics and the general talking volume nearing bar/club levels, you should be prepared.

We played it safe as starters go, ordering the soup, papaya salad and garlic chicken but none of them stood out compared to other Thai places in the city. The main courses are what really redeemed this place in my eyes, the kua gling was great,  well seasoned and perfectly cooked. I went for Thai spice (6), and my friend went for medium (2) with another entree and we both were at our comfort limit so be wary of your spice tolerance.I've periodically had other entrees from them via take out, and they were on par with what was served.

Ditch the starters and lousy service, get it to go instead.

Recommendations

-Chicken Kua Gling
-Pad Gra Prao"}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable Thai food, but long waits. I was 2 minutes late meeting a friend and they wouldn't even let her wait for me at the bar - couldn't spare the single seat on the off-chance that she wouldn't order food, I guess.

I don't know if I'll return...maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"I'll make this super quick and stick to the main points!
-Absolutely fantastic food, I actually can't eat Thai food anywhere else after I ate here the first time. Seriously, the menu is small (I like that) and everything is great. My personal faves are the original/chef's style pad thai and the yellow curry!

-There is usually always a wait, sometimes its not too bad - other times its brutal, even in the coldest of winters, you'll see people standing outside waiting to get a table - I usually avoid that mess by ordering takeout!

My only complain is there customer service via phone, its terrible - their phone system is brutal, they don't always answer - so you're calling 3-5 times (very annoying!) its hard to hear and I'm pretty sure it's linked to their fax line, so a couple of times I could hear that ear-piercing fax machine ringing! I've had issues in the sense that, its hard to hear them or its hard for them to hear me, mistakes/missing items in my order - don't get me wrong, I love this place and will keep going back, but the phone service is awful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a huge Thai food fan but I'm not hence the delay in trying out Khao San Road. I really hoped this restaurant would live up to its hype and change my disliking for Thai food but it unfortunately, did not. I really didn't find the uniqueness in flavours in the dishes, that would have me craving for more after every bite. 

We ordered their signature Khao soi (curry with egg noodles), squash fritters and the three flavours pad Thai. The Khao soi reminded me exactly why I don't like Thai food. It's too heavy and greasy. I found it weird eating noodles drenched in a thick curry broth. I was full after a few bites because of that. There was just soooo much sauce in every bite of noodles. The pad Thai tasted like what any other pad Thai would taste like so I wasn't sure which \"three flavours\" in particular were supposed to stand out.  The squash fries though, I enjoyed because it wasn't too oily but had a sweet and sour sauce that complimented it quite well. 

We also had to sit outside in the patio-in the cold -because inside and the waiting list was jam packed otherwise we would have needed to come back another day.  But that didn't bother me since I didn't want to mission back to this place another day anyway."}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin and her boyfriend. They love Thai food and suggested that this is a great place to go when visiting downtown Toronto. 

The restaurant atmosphere is lively and loud - packed restaurant by 5:30 pm. The tile wall is really cool. Bang Sue Bar is upstairs.

We ordered the Bangkok style Pad Thai, Pad Gra Prao, and Khao Soi all medium heat. the portion of the Pad Thai and the Khao Soi were large, the Gra Prao was average size and came with rice. I found the dishes overly sweet, the balance of flavours lacking - had to order plain rice, lime, and chili sauce to eat with the dishes as it was too sweet for me.

There are a lot of Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto - many are tastier than this place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ive been to this place twice (one year ago) and the food was FAN TAS TIC.

First time was with a couple of girlfriends, my friend who had been there before ordered the Khao Soi, I had the Pad Gra Pao and Squash fritters to share. My dish was good, but hers was amazing!

So I went back a couple of months later and ordered the same, Squash Fritters, Chicken Khao Soi and the pad thai trio. I still dream about this food. It is the most delicious thing ever.

Ive heard the original cook has moved down the street with his own business. Cannot wait to try!"}
{"text":"Best thai I've had in Toronto yet.

Green curry = yaaaas

Pad thai = yaaaas

Thai iced tea = yaaaas"}
{"text":"This place never failed me. One of best yummy Thai food in town, just don't order the cold appetizer roll.  Also not a big fan of the wait. But good things don't come easily."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, comparable to good Thai places in California. Would def. recommend the place."}
{"text":"Pro's:
- Great looking and bright interior
- Food overall tasted good
- Friendly service

Con's:
- Portion is a bit small for the price
- Small waiting area when the place is full
- No lunch menu

Ordered:
$15 - Bangkok Style Pad Thai - Tasted pretty good for the most part. Thought the portion was a bit too small
$14 - Red Curry - Also was pretty tasty

Conclusion:
I went here for lunch which was around 11:30, right before the rush. I was disappointed to see that there was no lunch menu option here. Overall, our waitress was quick and helpful and our food came out at a reasonable time. The food was pretty good but wasn't too outstanding nor different than other places. It tasted like what you'd expect from a popular Thai place. For the price of $15/$14, I expected a larger portion of food, which left me still feeling hungry. Overall, I enjoyed my experience. My only gripe would be price/portion for lunch hours."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times over the span of 3 years. I am happy to say that even though they have been so popular over these past few years, they have kept true to their original taste and are still very reasonably priced! 

My favorite dish is the chicken pad gra prao and I usually get it \"Spicy\". I tried \"Thai Spicy\" once and even though it is only one level above \"Spicy\" it was so much spicier that I could barely eat it. Make sure you are careful with this!"}
{"text":"Best Thai Cuisine i've had in Toronto so far. A small and boisterous restaurant with authentic Thai food. I usually sit at the bar because its always so busy. 
The Pad Thai street style is the best in Toronto, while the Green Curry is amazing as well. above salad king interms of food, but service can be alittle slow. the waitresses, all females, sometimes have a snobbish demeanor about them, but if you can get past that, the food quality is excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks. Buck a shuck on Thursdays upstairs Bang Sue Bar. Great service"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar as the restaurant was, as always, very busy - the bartender was great with her food suggestions and made my husband and I feel very welcome. Food was excellent - especially the crispy tofu and the curry portions were very large, we had leftovers for a couple days."}
{"text":"We went there Wednesday around 7:30 busy , waited for 15 minutes , seats were ready , time came to order , our server English wasn't that good ordered two Salads , though both were on the menu they were out , ordered the main food , was very tasty , ordered beer never got it , all in all my experience was not that good....."}
{"text":"Khao San Road has a best Thai food!!... The beef brisket was so juicy that I can still remember the taste very well... There is nothing I cannot love about the restaurant. The waiters, the decor and the atmospher.  Only wish I live in Toronto so I could visit the restaurant at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Yes, the line ups are crazy and it's always packed but the staff have a limited kitchen. 
But let's talk about the Khao Soi, shall we? 
Noodles and a braised beef live in the underworld of a coconut milk curry sauce and fried crispy noodles on top. A dash of mint, hot sauce and lime make this dish sublime. 
Amazing. Run don't walk kids."}
{"text":"awesome, authentic northern Thai. This place is too popular, so you really need a reservation and your entire party present to get seated. prople who complain about the line are usually high maintenance beotches who are disorganised.

everything is great. standouts include the swuash fritters, the pad gra pao, the curries, and the thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Came for lunch on Thursday with a few other coworkers, we arrived just before noon and was promptly seated. Two of us ordered the chicken panang curry (which was the curry of the day), and the other ordered the three flavours pad thai. The pad Thai was apparently really good, but the curry was just so-so. The server didn't ask what spice level we wanted, and what came out to us was very mild. It was on the salty side, and there wasn't much other flavour.

I would return to try the other food on the menu, but would skip the curry next time."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for too long. Since KSR doesn't take reservations, we were ready to do a bit a waiting to seat four on a Saturday night (as warned on the website). Ended up getting seated in 10 mins! Pleasant surprise. Loved the interior decor (painted tiles, cool art). There is also seating upstairs with a bar and neon wall art. In terms of food, it was only average. Very tasty, but Westernized thai food. They ran out of the bucket drank which was slightly disappointing."}
{"text":"Was so excited for the new Khao San To open. Unfortunately it just reminded me why I stoped going here when Pai opened. If your thinking of going here because it's close, you'd be better off with Thai Princes...

-Rude staff.
-Bland and flavourless food. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really good food all around. Had Pad Thai and pad gra prao both very good.
Can be crowded sometimes but wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food right now in the city. Service is great! Beer selection is limited to 1 type of beer, but we are here for the food! Pad Thai is amazing! The fried squash was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Pad thai is very flavorful and tasty! Their spice level is on point, not whitewashed so be mindful when ordering!"}
{"text":"this is the stuff dreams are made of. Honestly, writing this review is making my mouth water. I know people have their opinions about thai places in Toronto but you can't go wrong with Khao San (except maybe if you never make it in the door because the line is so freaking long). they have great vegan and gluten-free options and the staff are super nice. I've been just as happy ordering take out from them, so if you're discouraged by the ridiculous waits and no reservations, just get something to go!! seriously, the street pad thai is RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"I always order the Red Curry (which comes with squash; it's grown on me each time I order this). A friend I often go with has tried to diversify, but their choices are never as good as my trusty Red Curry. Also consider the squash fritters. Delicious.

The line ups are long, I've often opted for take out."}
{"text":"Amazing food; very rich and flavourful! Loved their pad thai and curries. Lineups are pretty much guaranteed but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in Toronto. Though most people seem to like their khao soi, I much prefer their curries and pad Thai. Green curry (either chicken or beef) is my favourite. I've been going to them since they first opened this location on Adelaide. In fact, even when they were on Parliament (this location is still there). 

However, this place does not reservations and though they open at 5pm for dinners, always expect a line up even if you arrive at 5:15. This is where they lose one star."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food in reasonable price! Love the décor and the food is super yummy.. I want more!! :)"}
{"text":"Two friends and I visited after Fifa world cup final 2014. Sunday afternoon I believe.
It was packed, there's maybe 20 - 30 seating. We ended up getting bar seats and the bartender served us. She was great, even though obviously overworked.
Food was great, pretty flavourful, I had something on the creamier side (I'll update this when I remember what dish I had..).
Nice atmosphere - rustic, industrial feel with stained wood and exposed pipe. There's also long communal tables which leads you to tight elbow room but open conversations. Patrons seem friendly, enough.
I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The only thing I love about this restaurant is their coconut water 
Ordered a pad thai and it was okay nothing special I dont really get the hype haha maybe I should try something else next time!

It's really annoying that they don't take reservations.. if you hate to line up you better go really early or really late"}
{"text":"Great food, quick service given the number of people in the place. We gave the server free license to order for our group, and came away with not too much money spent per person, and feeling like there was a lot (if not a little too much) food. Honestly more than you'd expect for a place that's this busy. Were accommodating of our friends' food allergies (and not easy ones for Thai food). Can't ask for much more. Will be back."}
{"text":"great food great drinks great service.

only downside is you will probably be sitting elbow to elbow to the people next to you, and that theres usually 30min-1hour wait. (and you have to wait outside)"}
{"text":"Really nice staff, very good food!  I recommend this place to everyone.

We started off with the fresh rolls.  Very fresh and Delicious!

I had the Pad Gra Prao as the lunch dish and ordered it level 8 spicy.  WOW!!!! For someone like me who can eat indian food very spicy, I wasn't expecting this SPICY to be SPICIER than the indian restaurants I go to. OMG!!!!!!!! When I say its spicy, believe me, ITS SPICY!!! My nose was running and that has never happened to me lol

As much as I love spicy food, I won't be doing that again there.  My dish was filled with chili flakes, both green and red.  The food itself was delicious but after a few bites, my mouth was too numb to feel anything.

If you like spicy, order level 3.  It will be spicy enough! 

My co-workers had the no spice and loved their dish.  I will try the Khao Soi next time as it tasted delicious as well."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food. We had the Khao Soi and the Pad thai, everything was delicious, good service as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"BEST THAI FOOD PLACE I'VE EVER BEEN TO!!!!

My friend recommend me to this place for a while and I finally have a chance to visit. At first I didn't know it could be this busy!!! I legit just come here with my friend after watching a musical nearby and didn't know where to eat. And we came here right before they open up, so we were at the beginning of the line, THANK GOD we were so lucky.

I have ordered a chicken red curry and a bowl of rice, it's a shame they don't have coconut rice. It'd be so great to go with the curry. The squash fritter that they serve, OMG... it's a dish that is send by the God himself... it's too heavenly good, we ordered that after we ate the curry which we messed up to the order... :P But at least I get to take away and enjoy it again the next day~ lol

It's a little far from the centre of Toronto Downtown, so you have to visit that area for THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I've lived in Thailand and this place makes Thai food on par with the best I've had over there. Curries are their specialty :) The pad thai is not bad, still better than most, but stick to the central thai dishes this place thrives at and you won't be disappointed. That's the curries!"}
{"text":"Everything you need to know - this isn't as good as Sukho Thai and there are no chopsticks.

The good:
- The service was very good (especially if you are accustomed to the terrible service at Sukho Thai)
- The food was good (but not mind blowing)
- The atmosphere was lively and the place was packed (but we didn't wait long for a seat at 630 on a Wednesday)

The bad:
- There is only one beer available and it's a shitty one
- There are no chopsticks (serious wtf from me on this point)
- The food isn't as good as Sukho Thai even though it's the same people
- It's slightly too expensive ($14-$16 pad thai)

Overall, I probably wouldn't choose to eat here again, but if someone else wanted to eat here I wouldn't complain.

There aren't too many other places in this neighbourhood that I like to eat at, so that in itself sort of bumps Khao San Road up 1 star.  I thought the food to price to experience rating was about a 2 or 2.5/5 but give it 3 because of lack of better choices in the area."}
{"text":"My first time going though I used to live in the 'hood and have seen this place pretty packed most of the times I went by.  I got there during the diner rush on a weekday. There were a bunch of people outside waiting for a table and inside was packed! I got a bit worried that my party and I would have to find an alternative place to eat but we got called in quickly. 

We got seated at the end of one of the large communal tables which I thought was a downside. I can't say with certainty it was the seating or the volume of the music but I could not hear the person across the table from me. What I could here was the person beside the person across the table from me, who was shouting to be heard by the person beside me. It made for a very annoying night and having to plug one ear to hear the conversation I'm part of made it hard for me to eat with two hands. So I eventually peaced out of my conversation only to substitute actually conversation with a sheepish grin and a nod. Don't get me wrong, I love a place that only plays hip hop music but something just didn't sit right. 

For dinner, we got the fresh rolls to share (6 roll $8). They were very flavourful, especially the fresh mint and the dipping sauce was delicious. I'm glad we go an app. since the food took a bit to come out. I'm not a big fan of Thai so I stuck with a basic Panag. I went for the veg & tofu option which offered a lot for my palette but I must admit,  after trying my friend's pad thai I regret not getting not ordering her dish  (Sam Roas/Three flavours pad thai - with pork). Next time!"}
{"text":"Spent a day downtown skating at nathan's and was looking for a nice place to eat downtown and remember my sister ranting about Khan San Road. So given the closeness from Nathan's, we ventured to khan San road. We arrived just before the dinner rush as surprisedly for a Monday, the place was packed. We were nicely greet to our seats by the hostess. Shortly after we were greeted by our waitress. The waitress was nice. We had a few minutes to look over the menu were we decided to order the Bangkok pad Thai  and green curry with a cup of Tom yum soup. The food came out fairly quickly and hot. The Tom yum soup was delightful with just enough spicy and flavour. The pad Thai looked authentic and tasted okay. With many pad Thai dishes I've had, I wouldn't rate it the best I've had. The green curry was tasty and to I wouldn't rate it the best green curry I've had. The atmosphere was pleasant with the rustic basement feel and nice painting on the wall. Overall, a nice Thai place to go to but definitely not my 1st go to Thai."}
{"text":"Love this place. No reservations but the atmosphere is fun so it's not an issue. Amazing food - takes me back to the night markets in Thailand. Service is friendly, helpful and quick."}
{"text":"Fantastic in every way. We waited about 40 mins for a table and it was well worth it. I got egg noodles with beef and yellow curry, and my girlfriend got the special pad thai. We also got the fresh roll appetizer. Everything came to the table very fast and was incredibly delicious. The host, waiter and owner were very accommodating. The owner came to talk to us after eating to make sure we enjoyed everything. We are from outside Toronto but will definitely be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I make it to Toronto I have to stop in and have the Pa Gra Prao. Waitresses are always friendly and willing to accommodate your requests. Minimal seating and have sat twice at the long tables, where there is not much room between you and your neighbor. Since the renovation it's better than NaNa their sister restaurant on Queen, the food always comes out hot, tasty and delicious. Atmosphere is mostly young 20 somethings and the music is always on. It makes for a fun night out with your family, a date, or as bite before you hit the city. Love Khao San Road and highly recommend it to everybody."}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto I would be here a couple of times per week.  Ranks up there with the best Thai places I've eaten at.  Fresh Rolls are excellent.  Really enjoyed the Yellow Curry and Pad Thai as well."}
{"text":"I have been here several times because both my brother and best friend love it. But I don't get the hype. The food is tasty, but I don't like feeling rushed, cramped and I certainly don't like waiting in lines! Also, some of the dishes are almost the size of tapas! I rather go to PAI where the prices and menu items are similar, and I can make a reservation! So I will continue to visit Sukho Thai for my brother and friend, but when I have a choice, it will be PAI."}
{"text":"The kind of place where it's worth waiting an hour in line for. Yes the food is THAT good. I always take any friends visiting Toronto to Khao San Road. It sucks that they don't take reservations but I guess given how crazy busy it gets, it makes sense. 

We usually get one of the curries - their Mussamum curry is excellent, one of their pad thais (street style is highly recomended) and my personal favourite - their Khao Soi. How do they make this dish!? I dream about it sometimes. 

They also have a vegan menu for my non-meat lover friends, so it's usually a good choice for a mixed group. 

I also love Suko Thai - their sister restaurant I believe, but the trendy, hip ambiance, service and food make this a great dinner option when you're out on a night about town :)"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at, and hands down the best Thai food. Best pad Thai, the green curry is bomb and the coconut shrimp was awesome. Great ambiance, and very affordable. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This restaurant is doing a lot of things right. Food is exceptional, service is prompt, and although the wait is long, their website clearly states what you might expect. The only thing I can fault them on is the service can be a bit rushed because they want to turn the table over for the growing line out the door. So don't expect to hang out and chat after the bill is paid. 

The dishes are spot on. Full of authentic flavour and seasoned perfectly. Get the Squash Fritters, you won't regret it. The khao soi is a solid choice as well. The tapioca \"rice\" pudding dessert is delicious and not too sweet. 

For a great Thai experience and you don't mind waiting for a table, Khao San Road is the place to be."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place has gone way down-hill after the reopening. The problem with the old location was the waiting time for a table. So they solved it by having an upstairs bar where you can order high-margin drinks, but no food. It solves the business' problem of monetizing people, but not the customer problem of wanting to eat quicker. 

The venue downstairs is a bit weird. Big windows looking at the back of MEC. Really tight quarters and shared tables, which is their thing, but it didn't have to be that crunched together. I ordered the classic green curry chicken, which I've had several dozen times before at Khao San. The quality was noticeably lower. 

Just my take, but I've heard it echoed across several friends. 

Hopefully we get a few new players in the Thai game in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Toronto!!  There's a reason this place is lined up outside. It is soooo good!  Fresh, flavorful , authentic."}
{"text":"Great food. They didn't have any fried squash so we tried garlic chicken. Very nice starter. Pad thai was very nice and green chili curry was tender and tasty. 
All in all, a great find."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food,  and very friendly Thai servers. We were very impressed with the service and food here.

The food was excellent for Toronto Thai food, we had green and red curry, and both had very authentic flavors and the servings were generous. We've done several cooking courses and traveled through Thailand, and my only desire is that It would be nice to see some more authentic vegetables in the curries (thai eggplant, mushrooms, long beans)."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, good Thai food. Bomb Thai ice tea to go with your meal.

Seating is a mix of standard table seating and stool seating.

I dropped by for a weekday lunch so there was no line and plenty of seating available. This place definitely gets busy for dinner and they don't take resos for groups under 8 so plan accordingly and expect to wait!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch since I always look at this place from across the road where I work sometimes and wonder why the heck it's always so packed!
Well, I found out why...they serve delicious food! To be quite honest, I couldn't even read the sign so I found out the name of this place from the menu. I had no idea it was even a Thai place until we sat down. 
It was lunch time, so as you can imagine it was rammed with people wanting to get in on what was probably one of the last patio days this year. Even though it was busy, we didn't wait long for a table, if at all which was surprising. I wound up getting the Yellow Curry and wondering what I would end up with. I was very pleased! Delicious and fragrant Jasmine rice with curry chicken and potatoes with coconut milk. I got a good size portion too. 
Now that I know what this place is, I will add it to my working from downtown rotation!"}
{"text":"It hadn't been long since they first opened when we visited Khao San Road for dinner. It was a Monday night when most of this part of the city was a ghost town, but the place was packed. 

After accessing the wait list for an actual table, we agreed to share one of the communal high tops. What we didn't realize though, was how impossible it would be for anyone to get in and out of the overly crowded set up. Not only was it a nightmare for any of us to wash our hands, even the servers could not get in (and would therefore forget) to take our orders for the longest time.

It was disappointing and slightly surprising to find out that wines were only served by the bottle. For such a casual place, wouldn't selling by the glass seem suitable? Regardless, a glass of Singha beer did the trick to distract that thought and quench my thirst.

Our forgettable appetizers arrived quickly enough (after being mistakenly delivered to the other end of the table), but it was an entire 45 minutes before our mains were served (also to the other end) after we had ordered.

I have to admit that my beef panang curry on rice was the most flavourful and authentic I had tasted in a very long time. My dinner dates' dishes were reported to be very good as well. I'm a big fan of Sukho Thai and am glad that they're doing well enough to expand. I just hope that they stick to what they do best and don't allow this new and exciting location's fancier set up water down the essential experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. Nothing on the menu is bad; it's all delicious. Morton is a way cool guy who cares about his restaurant and its reputation. Simple menu, simple food, simply awesome."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Khao San Road.  I did. I usually trust Yelp and with 4 stars I had high hopes.  I regret to write, however, that the food was mediocre. Most Thai food is severed with cloyingly sweet sauces, pools of curry, fried....everything, and this was no different.  I didn't see or taste anything classic.  I mean, Pad Thai and Red Curry?  It's a bit insulting to trap Thai food in this overly popularized menu.  Now I will say things tasted good.  But how can deep fried battered squash not taste good? Not to mention piled so high that any attempt at finishing it would nauseate even the most immune eater.  It didn't challenge my pallet and was awfully greasy. Not to mention there was no reprieve.  On the side the same sugar dipping sauce that apparently comes with anything (I suggest another side sauce with vinegar to cut the oil slick left on my tongue). Heavy, Heavy, Heavy curry, sweet and gummy noodles swimming in sauce.  Again, tasty, like drinking condensed milk out of a can is tasty,  but not subtle or honed in. There is so much culture in food and unfortunately I feel like KSR is catering to a market that doesn't appreciate execution and refinement.  They are pushing out high volumes of common, unexciting dishes, at a fast pace, and it makes me sad."}
{"text":"best thai food i've had in toronto. their pad thai is so flavourful from all the spices and herbs, not ketchup! I've never had a bad meal there. 

Their restaurant is a bit noisy so it might be hard to carry a conversation. Make sure to go early as there's always a line up"}
{"text":"Vibrant, chic, and very authentic.  You can't help but be in a good mood when eating here. 

Quality of food:  straight up party in your mouth. Very sophisticated yet fun blend of sweet, sour and umami tastes.

Highly recommend: Shrimp chips, papaya salad (for starters), pad gra prao and green curry (for main) and MUST try THAI ICE TEA. Look around, there's a reason why every table has a cup of that orange-goodness. 

Décor: cozy, trendy, but a little cramped. I guess it contributes to the whole very busy, bustling vibe that the actual Khao San Road in Thailand is known for. 

Price: Steep for a Thai restaurant, but each bite makes it totally worth it. I would say be prepared to pay around at least $30 per person. 

Ambience: It's very young and bustling with life. Most people are in their mid-20s. The main caveat being that the restaurant is a bit too loud. It is a little difficult to hold a comprehensible conversation with your friends without shouting. 

Service: Don't be fazed by the really long line. The most I have ever had to wait was 20 minutes. They always overestimate the waiting time. Service was fast as well. Also, thumbs up to the servers' dress style- so hip. 

What are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in TO everrr!
Love comimg here for lunch, thou if gets really busy and no reservations! Absolutely love their beff Kau Sol! Always wanna drink up every drop of the coconuty curry broth!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible.... doesn't cease to amaze with every visit.  

WORTH THE WAIT in any line under three hours.  Head to John Street for a few pints; you won't regret it.

Best Thai food I have had in Toronto, or anywhere, ever."}
{"text":"Khao San Road relocates to Charlotte St behind MEC, bigger place with two storeys and high ceiling. The new place has more natural light and can accommodate bigger groups with many long tables.  There is a \"waiting area with benches\" that you don't have to wait outdoor anymore. Upstairs have additional space and it will be a take out / snack bar as per the staff. 

We came on Tuesday, one week after the grand opening, and there was no wait. The waitress service was quick, but the kitchen was slow. We waited for 15-20 minutes for the food arrived after placing order

We ordered the signature Bangkok Street Style Pad Thai and Khao Soi with mild spicy. The food was authentic and delicious as before. I could taste the flavour of different spices. 

Since the restaurant is bigger and can fit more patrons, I hope the wait won't be as long as before and I will go back more often!"}
{"text":"Squash fritters and green curry! What are you waiting for? Go eat this now! 

There's a line and you don't want to wait? Shut up and quit whining. If this place want so god damn incredible then there wouldn't be a line. But it is, so deal with it. 

And don't forget to wash your meal down with a Thai iced tea. It's arguably the best in the city. Same goes for their green curry. You know what... to be safe, just go and order one of everything. And if there's anything left, you can give me your leftovers."}
{"text":"Wow. I am writing this while my insides are still feeling the spice. It is a good thing, especially when it is cold outside. 

Went originally to Pai and they had a huge wait so we came here for the first time and they gave us the patio. Was a bit of a wait for the food but once it came, it was worth it. I had the Khao Soi with medium spice and it was great. The curry sauce mixed with the meat and noodles perfectly. The portions were perfect too. We all greatly enjoyed out meal there. 

If you like spicy food at all, grab a bite here. If you come during mealtime, might be a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the food just is not as good anymore. Last time I went (couple months ago now) we ordered some fried chicken appetizer which once it arrived at our table, tasted bland and a bit fishy with a slight rubber like consistency and the pad thai just was not as good. I don't know what has happened but to me the place is going downhill."}
{"text":"Finally got in after a couple attempts at going here. There is always a wait. We got there at 5:15 and the restaurant was jammed and it opened at 5:00. 

That said it is easily the best Thai I have ever had in Toronto and second only to restaurants in Thailand that I have eaten at. There is definitely a reason for the lineups. 

We had the Thai green curry chicken which was spicy but not overly creamy. Then we had the Phad Thai with shrimp. Excellent execution not too oily perfect balance of flavours. Even the shrimp was perfectly cooked. Typically you get shrimp cooked like rubber at most Thai places. This was perfect!

We then had a dish with ground beef basil and a fried egg. This was spicy and also very good. 

We also had the fritters and cold rolls to start they were not bad but the other food was excellent. 

Worth the wait but you may want to go early"}
{"text":"just visiting toronto from sf and got this rec from a few friends. in a week, we ate here twice it was that good.
the food: the chef's special pad thai is the best pad thai i've ever had. and the dish with minced meat and rice was so flavorful and delicious that i couldn't stop eating it. the thai iced tea was also bomb and the cold mug of beer on a hot humid day was perfection.
the service: awesome server. there was a long wait, but the host was very nice. long waits seem pretty standard at any good place to eat in toronto. 
the space: great attention to detail and design. the music was a little loud and the crowd seemed overwhelmingly young, but overall, a very urban and well-designed space.
very sad that there is no khao san road in SF :("}
{"text":"After walking by this place for the last 6 months I finally tried it last night (November 19th/2015) and yay I am a fan. Pricing is fair for the this area and if you are looking for food with exotic infused flavours this is it. They have a very good menu selection and went with a papaya salad, which actually had a generous amount of fresh papaya in it and went the traditional pad thai. What I really like about this place if you want to adjust the spice the levels they will do this for you. The service was great, the food was fresh and the location was very tidy and clean, will I be back again? Of course I will!"}
{"text":"Squash fritters are excellent - tasty batter coating grated squash, crunchy not greasy and nice tart/sweet/spicy dipping sauce. Thai iced tea was interesting.
The traditional pad Thai was ok probably should have gone for the street style instead. Decor reminds me of the old salad king space but with wood and steel  communal tables and a nice bar space."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Thai food in my lifetime but eating at Khao San for the very first time some how made me feel as though I lost my Thai food virginity all over again.

Coming to Khao San takes a bit of patience as one should be warned there is waiting involved with eating here as they do NOT accept reservations. It's first come, first served at Khao San, so just make sure you're only slightly hungry before you arrive so you can weather the wait, trust me it's well worth it!

My friend and I arrived hoping to secure a spot on a Friday at 5pm and there was a line-up 14 people deep!  We were very politely informed by the kindly, yet cool as a cucumber host that we would be accomodated in about 40 minutes time, and to leave our name and come back in 30 minutes to be seated. No worries, we killed time by going to Chapters around the corner to look at pictures of artistic male nudes...well I did anyway!

Once we came back we were promptly seated and served.  I was surprised at how small but rustic/modern canteen-ish Khao San was inside. It's pretty loud as there's alot of folks crammed into this smallish space and they were blasting The Scorpions \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" and a hit parade of 80's head-banger tunes, but once the food arrived the ambiance didn't matter as my tastebuds were spellbound by the Thai culinary sorcery of Chef Nuit.

 For starters we noshed on a healthy serving of the Squash Fritters and lemme just say that sweet potato frites by comparison will never suffice again.  These deep fried nests of squash with a nice peanut shallot dipping sauce are (sorry for caps) THE BEST APPETIZER EVARR!!!  We also ordered the Sam Roas style Pad Thai, which was outta this world, a complexity of flavours, salty, sweet, and sour that all equally hit the right notes, like a Thai symphony in my mouth!  My girlfriend who is notorious for eating nothing but pad thai declared the Sam Roas style as the King of Pad Thais.  With each magnificent morsel of food, we were blown away by the Khao San flavour party !!  

People, get your ass to Khao San Road NOW!!!  It's like tasting Pad Thai for the very first time http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6SIDNfOjNM"}
{"text":"A lunch date with a friend of mine who suggested the place saying that it was better than Salad King which used to be our go-to place.  I can definitely say that Khao San Road blows it out of the water!

We ordered the Gra Bong (squash fritters) to share, I ordered the Chef's Special Pad Thai with Shrimp, and my friend ordered the Gaeng Phed (red curry).  If you're going to get anything, get the squash fritters.  They were to DIE for!  I could have eaten the entire plate myself if I didn't have to share!  So flavourful and not overly heavy, which is a rare occurrence with fried food.  The pad thai was delicious, but I would have liked to see some more veggies in it as otherwise I felt the dish was a little on the boring side.  Don't get me wrong though, the sauce was delish.

I'll definitely keep this place in mind when I hit up Toronto again, although I think I'll have to try the curry!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai places in the city. Delicious pad thai, Panang curry and Khao saoi. The Gra Bong is an excellent appetizer. Good to share. Fried to perfection and is accompanied by a tangy sauce. The spicy beef salad has a unique taste. I've never been disappointed by any of the food I've tried here.

Downsides: Noise level. Bring a microphone if you want to have a conversation with your friends. Just kidding. Sort of. There's also a lack of privacy since much of the seating is communal. I wouldn't say it's the most intimate setting. Another downside is their lack of reservations. When I don't want to wait for a table and have a big group, I go to Pai instead. Khao San Road gets really busy, especially on the weekend. Unless you're a group of two, you'll likely be waiting at least a half hour at dinner time. They also won't seat you until your entire party has arrived. There is a Starbucks a few steps away though. Good place to hang out after you put your name down on their list and wait for their call to tell you your table is ready.

P.S. when they say spicy, they mean spicy! Don't attempt their highest spice levels unless you want your insides to burn so intensely that no amount of bread or milk could save you. Trust me. I've had (self-proclaimed) spice aficionados, well-versed in Szechuan, Thai, and other hot-pepper-crazy cuisines fall to their feet after getting their orders."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today and there wasn't any lineup at all. The khao soi was delicious. Large chunks of tender beef and super crispy egg noodles is the best combination ever invented. My boyfriend got the yellow curry of the day and it was good too. I didn't find the yellow curry to be spectacular or anything since they usually pre make the lunch specials in advance. So the curry was comparable to salad king. 
The waitress was friendly as well. The only thing I could suggest is for them to increase the rice size. Since it cost $3 for additional bowls of rice and there was a lot of curry sauce left. Also, I ordered spicy (level 3) and it wasn't spicy at all. So I would suggest thai spicy or higher if you are looking for szaichuan food spicy."}
{"text":"KSR use to be my overall favorite place.  I would go at least 3 times a week and the lines were always out the door with lots of people waiting.  In the last 6 months this has drastically changed.  There are less people coming here now and the service has gone down.  They are quite rude now."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Khao San Road.  I absolutely adore Sukhothai, so I was very curious to try this place.   I don't think I'll return though.

Yes the food was good.  We had the fresh rolls to start, the chicken khao soi, the special pad thai, and a green curry chicken - all ordered spicy.  Each dish was really flavorful.  Our server was really nice though too busy to be all that attentive.  

My beef with this place is the old adage that a popular place's downfall will be its own popularity.  I called and was told they'd hold a table for us if we got there in the next twenty minutes.  We made it in fifteen, yet there was no table.  They'd given it away.  So we waited.  Eventually, we were told we could sit if we shared a table with another party.  When I saw the size of the table they were expecting seven of us to sit around, I was unimpressed.  It was too damn small to accommodate that many people.  So we declined, deciding to wait for a more private table.  We ended up sitting at another table where they kept cramming more and more parties around it.  In the end, eleven people were stuck around a table that could only hold eight comfortably.  Come on!

It was a Tuesday night when we visited.  I shutter to think of a Friday or Saturday!  As we juggled our dishes in the tiny space we had to ourselves, I watched the line.  People just kept coming.

I think this restaurant would be AMAZING if it could double its size.  Until that happens, I will happily order from Sukhothai."}
{"text":"I went to Khao San Road some years ago at their old location. The internet raved about how pretty the new location is so I decided to check it out. I went on a weeknight and was a bit disappointed that you weren't allowed to be seated until everyone from your party was there (not sure if this was the case for their previous location as well). I had to wait on the second floor in the meantime. By the time I could be seated, all of the individual tables were filled up and I was seated at one of the communal tables on the first floor.

If you're seated at a communal table, there are hooks under the table for you to hang your bag and coat (though they are quite low if you have a longer jacket). The chairs for the communal tables are also high without a back rest, so there might be difficulty finding a place to hang your jacket during the winter time. They have more seating on the second floor (that can be booked out for events), which also has a bar.

I had the Pad Gra Prao and it came out as expected, vegetables with fried pork over a fried egg and rice. Prices are $15.50 or $16 for their main dishes. Khao San Road is comparable in terms of menu and cost to Pai, which is just down the road. Overall, a cool and casual restaurant to check out and catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Warning, this review is simply about the customer service (or lack there of) and NOT about the food- as I couldn't actually take the time to ENJOY it.

Walked by and noticed this place had a lineup at the door. We wanted to try a new place so we decided to put our name down for a party of 4. We were quoted an outrageous 2 hours for a table, and were given the option to leave our phone # and have them call when a table would be ready. We decided to go to Spin (a Ping Pong place on King West) to pass the time. After about and hour and a half we got the call that our table was ready so we decided to head back.

Once seated, we were expecting 1 more guest who worked around the area and wanted to join last minute. Once we let the server know, they immediately turned the switch and became disgustingly rude.They tried to explain how this was \"against their policy\" and in order to accept another guest at our table, we had to order an extra dish (on top of the 5 dishes that were already ordered). Fine, whatever, more money for them. We were all sharing so we picked something random.

Our guest arrived when the food came (30 min or so after being seated). We were pleasantly surprised at the food- it wasnt anything like we've had before. Truly authentic. 

Sadly, every 10 minutes they would come to ONLY our table and tried to kick us out. There were other tables of 4 that had een seated before us yet they werent getting any lecture. They even put the bill on the table when we werent ready to settle up. No paying guest at a restaurant should be told when to leave, (maybe with the exception of all you can eat places). And no one should be told to hurry up for the \"customers that are waiting outside.\" Excuse me, aren't we paying customers as well? 

The worst part was we never got to enjoy the food, which ended up to be something I've never had before. The food was great, but the way we were treated was disgusting and ruined our entire experience. 

We will never be back, and will tell everyone we can to avoid this place due to their LACK of hospitality mannerism."}
{"text":"One word... well, ok, 3... Mmmm... mmmm... mmmmmmm.... !!! Khao San Road is freakin' delicious!! Chef Nuit is the BOMB!!! It is my absolute new favourite Thai place in the city, and these guys definitely know what they're doing. It's got a cool hipster, no frills vibe on the inside, is totally unpretentious, blares rock music (if you've got a headache, I wouldn't recommend going..) and has amazing staff. Oh, and the fact that their food is the BEST thai food in the city doesn't hurt either.. 

Their portions are decent, and if you dig real spicy (not \"white man spicy\") then I would recommend trying thai spicy.. it'll definitely make you sweat! Still super flavourful, so you don't just taste hot, and with a nice kick.

My fave dishes are: street-style pad thai, pad gra prao (beef & topped with a fried egg, of course..), tom yum soup and tom ka gai soup. I'm sure everything else on the menu is absolutely dee-lish, but I've gotten stuck on these for the time being (months..?) :).

It's good to see that Khao San Road actually has longevity in this place (this location always had the kiss of death and could never last) and is always ram-packed, no matter what time of day. So you have to wait for a table.. so what. Once you delve into the delicious food, you'll leave your worries at the door.. trust me.."}
{"text":"Green curry was watery and barely warm. Portion size was unacceptable. Other food looked better so have an extra star."}
{"text":"Definitely lives up to the hype!  It's busy at all times but if you're a small group it shouldn't be too hard to get a seat.  They pack people in tight like a can of sardines so don't expect much privacy or quiet. Service was about what you'd expect in a packed place, food came quicker than i was expecting and appetizer arrived in minutes.

Food was amazing.  We ordered the Fresh Rolls as a starter, which is a pretty standard thai dish but their dipping sauce was really impeccable (just the right amount of heat for an appetizer). As our main course we shared a chef's special pad thai (chicken) and a pad gra prao (minced beef on rice).  The pad thai was greasy and delicious, I like how they put a twist on the standard pad thai (noodles+sauce made it a bit soggy but i think that was on purpose because it tasted awesome).  The pad gra prao tasted good as well, but was kind of overshadowed by the pad thai.  It's a pretty common dish, but i enjoyed the way they made it (nice and filling).

If you like spicy you might want to go hotter than medium, which was more of a slow burning aftertaste, than a sweating forehead hotness."}
{"text":"So good. I recommend the squash fritters. Only downside is that lines are long and it is loud. Good with friends, not really a date atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Honestly, I went here a couple of months ago, and totally forgot to put my review- but forgot because of how i memorable it was.

My lovely boyfriend brought me here because he heard great reviews about it, and I feel bad ranking it so low because he planned it and everything but you know, shit happens lol

First off, I know this isn't a place for wifi, but I thought I asked for it anyways because I always do (2 gb limit you know) and I had seen my waiter talk to another waitress (probably manager) about it and clearly there was wifi but she just gave me a look with attitude and told my waiter to tell me no. After this incident she just did not give me a welcoming vibe throughout the entire service. But that's besides the point. 

I ordered the beef/pork and rice and my boyfriend ordered the pad Thai and both dishes were very underwhelming and worst of all, both dishes were SO spicy that I felt miserable eating it. Every spoonful I had to wash down with water- really felt as if they dumped a whole load of red pepper on it. Didn't even bother to ask for another one because it was so busy and didn't want to wait again so I just sucked it up and ate what was not worth our money. 

Honestly did not taste like Thai food at all and let's just say I never returned again. 

Highly recommend Pai or Sukhothai as one of the best Thai food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came with a local friend a while ago! Like August 2012.

Even though we were only a party of 2, this place is packed and we still had to wait like 40 minutes to get seated.

I believe I got the Khao Soi with chicken, very spicy, but not Thai spicy. Even so, it was frickin' spicyyy! I needed a lot of water to finish my meal. But it was really good! I would totally come back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"This might be a clear difference between me and an actual food critic. It's a rare occasion that I make it to a new restaurant at the apex of it's buzz, yet after booking a table a week in advance I found myself at Khao San Road on Saturday night. I have a love-hate relationship with Thai food. Done properly, I love the riot of colors and range of flavors that emerge from what's often described as a simple palette of hot, sour, salty and sweet. A great green curry can make me swoon, and noodles are always welcome, regardless of ethnicity. I hate so much of what actually constitutes Thai food in this city: a sweet, gloppy, ketchuppy mess. As a matter of disclosure, my tastes lean more towards savory than sweet, so I find most Toronto Thai food cloyingly inedible. To this point, I've done best at Salad King, when I ask the kitchen to turn down the sugar and turn up the heat. I know there are other good spots, but after so much mediocre, tell-tale red pad Thai, I rarely feel the need to bother. 

Khao San Road promises a revolution. An offshoot of Sukho Thai in Regent Park, I'd given up on the original since located it's a neighborhood I won't visit because it's haunted by the ghost an ex-girlfriend. The new spot on Adelaide was worth the trip. It's a tiny place on a bordeline-skechy stretch of Adelaide. Neighboring buildings are slated for demolition and condofication, which means that tables should be extra-hard to come by in a few years. I'm happy to enjoy this place while I can. The back wall is dominated by a blackboard that features the wine and drinks list. To my right, a long bar proves a rate-limiting step when it comes to refills of water, green tea served in squarish glass mugs, and bright orange Thai Iced Tea made with condensed milk and shaved ice. Ordered in place of dessert, the tea is at once refreshing and mouth-feely delicious. We argue at the table about it's flavoring, but all agree about how addictive it is. What's less addictive is the constant grind of the ice machine as orders are filled. Khao San Road is low-ceilinged and narrow; concrete floors and wooden fixtures are industrially comfortable, but sound bounces endlessly throughout the room. Our biggest complaint is the need to yell to be heard as tables turn constantly around us. 

Service is pleasant but harried. Orders are delivered as they arrive, regardless of where they show up on the menu. 

An order of fresh rolls with house-made chicken sausage comes first. It is devoured in seconds; the accompanying sweet-salty dipping sauce cleaned out of it's dish. In hindsight, it's freshness would have been useful against the chili apocalypse to come. Garlic chicken features tender breaded bites of breast, while squash fritters are umami-amped latkes, courtesy of shrimp paste. We consider an order of shrimp chips, but decide against. I could be perfectly happy with a group of friends, some chilled sing ha beer, and a few shared plates of these appetizers; getting louder, smarter and more attractive with each bottle. 

Mains set a new standard for Toronto Thai. Green curry is wonderfully complex; chock full of chicken and veg, in a sauce that you could spoon over rice all by itself. Ordered mild so as not to offend the spice-phobic in out group, it's all depth of flavor, no burn. Street-style pad Thai is also ordered on the mild side; somewhat sweeter, it features perfectly done noodles, chicken, shrimp and vegetables, in just enough sauce to bind. Even better, it is blissfully ketchup-free. 

I take responsibility for the evening's sole unsatisfactory experience. I love hot and spicy food. Decades of eating Thai in Toronto have taught me that if I want a bit of burn, I need to order \"Thai hot\", and that's how I request my bowl of Khao Soi; chicken, egg noodles in curry sauce topped with crispy fried noodles. The first few bites are delicious; complex curry flavours, lovely poached chicken and springy noodles. Even now I could go for an appropriately-spiced bowl. But Sweet Daddy Siki, this is hot stuff! A film of angry-orange chili oil slicks the surface of the bowl, and random blobs of chilies impart densely smoky flavor. Bite number three is a hard punch to the chest. I'm advised that I'm turning purple. I keep eating, but only manage to get through half before giving up. It is rich and delicious, but too much for me on this evening. 

I leave Khao San Road having learned a valuable lesson. Thornhill is not Thailand. I have no business ordering anything \"Thai Hot'."}
{"text":"My favourite is the Iced Thai Tea! I always get the Beef Curry with the crispy egg noodles. It is a great spot for lunch or brunch and the line is never too long unless you go during the rush peaks. It is very close to my office so I go quite often. The service is great because I have a time limit on my lunch. Thank Khao San Road team! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"A mess is often a sign of someone who doesn't know what they are doing or someone who is moving too fast - in this case - it was probably both - I don't eat a lot of Thai but had to check this restaurant out during a recent visit to Toronto.  The Khao Soi with beef is a must try - the coconut curry sauce is soooo good that I let my shirt and the counter have some as well .  It is a filling dish - probably good for 2-3 people to share.  The Thai beer was refreshing on this day that was blazingly hot . 
It was busy and service was excellent.  I liked seeing the servers make a point to make sure everything was cleaned before new customers sat down - sometimes when a place is so popular - things get overlooked - not here."}
{"text":"Used to live around the corner and gotta say their Khao Soi is really good. It's hard to find authentic Thai cuisine in Toronto so if you're down for some flavors and good food, I would highly recommend. Like other yelpers had mentioned, the communal seating is not very comfortable, if you are looking for a romantic/lax night out, go somewhere else lol. Everything else is pretty consistent but I don't think the wait/line up is worth it. There's Pai down the street and it's just as great if not better. 

Side Note: Caught the manager/owner drinking beer while serving their customers, I personally don't mind it but ya....

Pros:
Ambiance: fun/young/casual
Food: delicious authentic Thai food
Cons:
- long wait/line up
- uncomfortable seating"}
{"text":"No, it isn't \"officially\" open yet, but I had a very special sneak peak of the new Khao San Road (sister restaurant to Sukho Thai) over the weekend. 

Tucked away in a basement on Adelaide St just east of Peter, Khao San opened it's doors for a special tasting menu and extended an invite to those who had registered with their website. (Owner says official opening should be February 1st, if not sooner)

Chef Nuit was in the kitchen and hubby (manager of Sukho Thai) were onsite to greet guests and explain more about the new restaurant and menu. The menu at Khao San Road will be very similar to Sukho Thai but they are trying out some new dishes in hopes to replace some of the least popular ones.

My friend and I got to pile through SIX DISHES of excellent, authentic Thai cuisine. 

We started the night with garlic shrimp, breaded and fried to perfection. Not too greasy, nicely cooked and served with a spicy chili sauce. 

My favourite of the evening was a green curry with thin noodles, shrimp and chicken. Amazing.

We also sampled a delicious (and healthy) spicy chicken salad, a garlic pork dish and a Tom Kha Gai soup.

The night ended with warm coconut tapioca pudding for dessert. OMFG. Me want recipe. Served with a tall glass of thai iced tea.

The food quality and taste is A+++ here. It's the best Thai I've had since backpacking in Thailand 5 years ago. No joke. The flavours are so rich; very complex yet somehow simple. Food is beautifully presented.

The decor at Khao San is plain but cosy and functional. Nice oak tables sanded down. Restaurant is small, seats around 30. Cool bar (with alcohol!) set up along one side. Emphasis here is definitely on the food.

(In case you are wondering, \"Khao San Road\" is actually the name of the main backpacker street where all the travellers head to upon arrival in Bangkok). 

They even had Jack Johnson playing quietly in the background, just like the real Khao San Road. All that's missing are the tuk-tuks, thai whiskey buckets and a few lady-boys."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.

Fresh rolls ($10) and Squash fritters ($12.5)
Homemade chicken sausage mixed in with lettuce, carrots, thai basil and mint wrapped in rice paper. I personally didnt like the rolls, probably because of the flavor from the mint. The squash fritters were really good though. Nice and crispy, flavorful with a hint of lemon grass flavor. It's like eating squash chips! Crunchy and tasty, but not sure it was worth the price.

Three flavors Pad Thai with chicken ($15.5)
Not sure how this was different than the bangkok-style pad thai. Maybe because it was three flavors so stronger in flavors and more on the saltier end. Tasty though! Portion was large compared to other thai restaurants.

Service was good and food was okay. I was slightly disappointed with my choice of appetizers though. The atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"If you love spicy food like I do, do not underestimate the Thai Spicy. I never had such a terrible upset stomach. The curry in itself was thick and heavy but I definitely overdid it by asking for Thai Spicy. Overall I enjoyed my meal and ate a good portion before I had an upset stomach. My friend got the pad thai and thai spicy, and she also had the same problem, we tried each other's dishes so maybe it was a combination of both that churned a horrible storm in our stomachs. Nevertheless we enjoyed the food, we just won't be coming back after being traumatized with upset stomachs. Too bad we couldn't handle the heat.

Place is packed btw, don't expect to go with a huge group and get seated. Luckily there was only two of us and we managed to grab a seat.

The servers were prompt when bringing us water which was MUCH MUCH NEEDED."}
{"text":"Great food. Great Vegan options. 

Only bad experience - Three of us arrived on time. Wouldn't allow us to sit until the fourth guest arrived, even though a table was available. Offered to buy drinks/apps while we waited. Nope."}
{"text":"A good 4.5

The place is almost always packed (and they do not take reservations), especially of young students (again, probably because you almost surely will have to wait 20 to 30 minutes outside to be seated in a packed canteen-like atmosphere place sharing huge tables with others, elbows-to-elbows).

The service is OK. Seating staff is nice and quite effective. Waitress are OK but not on the fast side, as is, most importantly, the kitchen. If you are in a rush, that is unlikely a place to go.

This being said, the food is really REALLY  good! Curries especially!! So sad, this is not the kind of places I would plan and schedule ahead to go... to me, such canteen thai places are more when I am around and suddenly in a crave for thai food... but unfortunately, I rarely have then 30 minutes to wait to be seated then 20 more to get my food."}
{"text":"Amazing says it all!"}
{"text":"Awesome. I stop here every time I visit Toronto. A little tight inside but that's no big deal. Go here!"}
{"text":"green curry is very good. ambiance is not my style. too new age. don't get the thai spicy. it's spicier than you think"}
{"text":"The signature dishes are deservedly well named. The fresh rolls and steak salad, also delicious. I'm on a hectic work trip, so I don't want to muss around with dinner. The food is amazing and the staff know how to do hospitality...Get a signature dish and a beer or two. Wine pairs also. Perfect for a solo business traveler who wants good food and a nice ambience. Looking forward to try Nana - http://www.stnnana.com"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and amazing  Pad Gra Prao (Beef $13.00). Tried my friend's chicken and it was just as delicious. This time I got the Thai Spicy and it was perfect for me. The bartender suggested that I get extreme spicy next time. Maybe, just maybe.

Pad Thai
Kao Soi
Fritters
Thai Iced Tea

There's nothing that's better. 
I make sure I take a trip here every time I'm back in town"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the vibes were amazing got their at about 7:30 waited a half an hour I didn't mind though the music kept me content.  Once we were in we tried the garlic chicken which was with a side of a plum sauce concoction which was utterly delightful. I got the pad thai it tasted so flavourful with the right level of spice to balance it out. We sat at the bar which wasn't totally amazing just because I personally hate high chairs but the dining area is small compared to some restaraunts. Other than that though I loved this place would definitely go again and recommend to others!"}
{"text":"SOLID Thai food
Cool ambiance

but

they need to be better organized seating people during a wait ... much of which would be solved by seating the right party size at their few large tables (rather than 2s at their 4 tops or 3-4 in their 6-8 person booths).  

and ...

get a coat rack!"}
{"text":"Super busy so if you're going for lunch, order in advance.
My go to for pad grapow, so delicious. A wee bit oily, but the flavour is great and pretty darn close to what you'd get locally in Thailand.
Their chilli-hot level is Thai style though so if you're a chilli sookie la la, go for mild. We went for a work lunch and a woman from my office I'm not a fan of asked for medium chilli and cried through her whole meal it was so hot, much to my delight!"}
{"text":"For our weekday lunch, the crowd was mainly suited-up professionals. The decor is modern. Service was friendly, not pushy but not super attentive either. We ordered the Khao Soi, Bangkok pad thai, and Panang Curry. My boyfriend ordered the top spicy (highest spicy level) Khao soi and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I tried a bit of it and I definitely wouldnt recommend this level of spiciness for everyone though, his spice tolerance is a little superhuman... According to him, the flavours in the curry meshed together perfectly with the heat so I think his was 5/5.

I ordered a Pad Thai and it was a tad too sour and maybe on par with what you would get at most Thai restaurants in Toronto. I ordered it at a medium level of spiciness but it actually wasn't that spicy to me and I'd give it 3/5. I also got a Thai iced tea which was pretty good-- it had a nice blend of strong tea flavour and sweetness."}
{"text":"Have been a long-term customer of this restaurant. It was great a couple of years back.
Food is good.

The service however is not customer friendly at all:
1)  You will not be allowed to seat until everyone from your party arrives (even if 1 person is late)
2) They do not split the bill
3) No more that 3 credit cards per table (makes a huge problem for a larger group)
4) The restaurant is open only few hours a day and they usually do not let customer in 20 min before closing time
 5) The MANAGEMENT is very rude."}
{"text":"Having a casual night out with friends tonight, and craving for some thai. 

This restaurant doesn't disappoint me with food. The medium spicy pad thai is just right, and the thai iced tea is amazing.

However, the atmosphere and service are poor. First of all, this place is too noisy. It is almost impossible to listen to the person that sit opposite to you. Besides, they force you to share table yet the waiting time is not any shorter. I believe one of the main reasons is that the food takes too long. We almost waited 10 mins for food. 

As more and more people in line, they have no service. All servers did were take order and give you the bill. One very unacceptable thing is that they DO NOT do separate bills yet can do a division of the bill. Their reasoning is that the maths won't add up. This reason is not even legit.

The overall experience is poor, however, the food is pretty good. If you are craving for some thai , and willing to pay $20+ for fast food service. This place could be an option."}
{"text":"Finally made it into this place, having read some great reviews. We were there right at 5pm, and what a good idea that was. The place filled up steadily (on a Tuesday night), and with good reason. The food was fresh, and perfectly spiced to each of our tastes. I was happy with the \"level\" 2 spice, and could go up to a \"3\" next time. I prefer my food medium spicy (as in medium spicy wings or salsa),  just for reference. My co-diners were thrilled to be able to enjoy their \"0\". They were a little apprehensive about trying Thai food, since they have experienced too much heat in the past. It's a great place to introduce people to Thai food.
The servers were very  accommodating, and did a good job in explaining the dishes to us. I am looking forward to trying other dishes, in particular the appetizers. The daily special was very good (garlic chicken on rice), and my noodles were fantastic! I enjoyed the community seating, since we were in a bit of a time-crunch. Not someplace to linger on a date, but a great place to start the evening.

Definitely returning."}
{"text":"Lunch portion of Pad Thai was too small, and plate lacked garnish/lime wedges so it felt a bit \"empty\" with too much whitespace when presented at the table.  However, the taste was very flavourful.  Their Pad Gra Prao looked like a much larger portion despite being identical in price with the Pad Thai.

Want larger glasses of water, want more ice."}
{"text":"Service was good and expected (except for the long wait). Squash fritter was delicious. 8/10 would get again.

Khao soi was good for the first three bites...afterwards it just gets too creamy for my personal taste. Would not get that again.

Generally, for a picky person like me, would not go out just to dine here. If I pass by, then mayble."}
{"text":"The waitress is very thoughtful and it's the best Thai I tried till now in Toronto. I tried green curry and Thai ice tea. Love the curry, they have mild, spicy very spicy many levels of spicy can be chosen. It is very thoughtful. The tea tastes a bit too sweet. LOL"}
{"text":"I stayed quite literally right across the street from here, and at 6pm on a Saturday, decided we would hop over here for dinner. We assumed we'd need to wait because the place was pretty full, but as a party of 2 we were told we could sit at the \"community table\" for no wait. All that meant was that you could have another party seated next to you, but when you're hungry and not allergic to other people, there's no problem with that!

Our server was with us right away, and the food came out very quickly. I ordered the \"pad see ew\" with chicken, which is essentially rice noodles, broccoli and soy sauce. They describe the rice noodles as wide, and they are not kidding! The noodles resembled lasagna noodles. Clearly homemade and absolutely delicious! I ordered the dish as medium heat, and I think I could have gone a bit hotter- I've been conditioned by other Thai restaurants that when I order medium, the spicy level is actually much hotter, but this one was a true medium.

Overall I had an awesome meal! We were seated quickly and the food came out right away, the food was delicious, and the portion size was very generous. I've had larger portions at Thai takeout places, but this is a restaurant and the food is a bit more refined than takeout, so naturally the portion is a bit smaller. However, it was plenty adequate and filled us up while leaving room for dessert which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Love khan San road! Second favourite Thai restaurant in Toronto next to Kiin. This place has great vibes and delicious food!! The Thai iced tea could be better but other than that, every dish I've tried has been yummy. The bar on top is also great with really good food as well. This place is busy so you have to come early!! I would come here over and over again."}
{"text":"Delicious! The food here is exceptional, assuming you can get in!  This spot is popular so you can expect a wait to get in.

I've had the chicken khao soi on both of occasions I dined here - I kept wishing that the bowl would automatically refill itself, and often dream of the meal.

Good spot for a date or catching up with friendS - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a difference.  Showed for lunch promoting the place among all friends of mine. And there I was standing with a friend in a half empty place indifferently observed by at least 5 floor people and kitchen personnel waiting to be seated for amount of time enough to start questioning myself if I want to pick up burrito in burrito bandidos. Finally approached by someone on the phone \"no, we do not take reservations...\" and got seated without a nod, or an eye contact or hi. Nice. 
Khao San Road is getting spoilt by attention? Customer Service is not relevant to business any more? Maybe your clientele is changing to I-am-ok-with-any-bull.sh. type. Very sad. Good luck."}
{"text":"I'll have to be honest, I don't share the same sentiment as most people I know who've been to Khao San. I just don't feel as wow-ed and I've been here 3-4 times so I definitely gave it a chance. 
First, there's always a long line up and the seats are too close to each other. I sat in the communal table once and it was quite uncomfortable as we were sitting elbow to elbow with other people and could not have a proper conversation. 
Food was good, flavour was there, definitely more authentic than most Thai spots downtown. I just don't remember it to be remarkable. I don't find myself wanting to come back, or craving certain dishes. I tried their bangkok style pad thai, pad gra prow, green curry and gra bong. All pretty solid dishes, so I think you just have to try it for yourself and see if Khao San will tickle your palate."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very tasty. Be careful to get the right spice level, the food can be extremely spicy. Server was very informative and excellent vibe in the restaurant. It's a definite must if you're a fan of Thai food."}
{"text":"Long line ups when weather gets better. Their Thai food is definitely good and I was glad they had Thai Ice tea. I tried their Khao so and garlic chicken and it was very tasty."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Atmosphere - amazing; water gun fights - ridiculously amazing; food - average.

I recently attended their annual Songkran (New Year's) celebrations with a few friends and it was, quite possibly, the zaniest and over-the-top dinner I've ever had! The Thai tradition of throwing water during this festival translated to arming diners with puny water guns and staff with super soakers. It was the classic battle of quantity versus quality - in the end, however, it mattered nought because everyone was drenched! Your belongings stayed dry with the provided plastic bags, but I couldn't help but wonder the beating their walls and hardwood floors were taking!

The $55 prix fixe (tax and tip included) starts you off with a seafood salad, grilled chicken wrapped in (?banana) leaves and their oyster mushroom soup (this was the highlight for me...hot, flavourful and chock-full of mushrooms!). Their main was their curry pork belly, which was suprisingly underwhelming given how fattylicious it was. Finally, their dessert was a plate deliciously sliced mangoes over sticky rice. 

Even without the water gun fights, Khao San Road is a festive and bustling place with half the tables being communal. Their location is prime and it's best to go as a group (reservations recommended on pretty much any night of the week). My only knock is that the food is merely decent - for me, Mengrai Thai has some of the best Thai food in town."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here and when I took a look at the line outside, I thought to myself, \"oh, no this is going to one of those.\" Luckily, no wait! it was just the two of us, so they sat us at the bar.

I ordered the Khai Soi with chicken and so did my friend. She also got a Thai Iced tea so I got to take a sip of that. First off, the Khai Soi was so flavourful. It was packed with so much flavour and it was perfectly creamy - rich, but not heavy. The Thai Iced Tea was also really good - wished I ordered it. 

I can see why it's so busy here and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There was a 2 hour wait but I can finally cross Khao San Road off my checklist.  Luckily there are plenty of good bars in the area to keep you busy. 

The chicken rolls were quite simply the best I have ever had. The tamarind sauce was just exceptional.   

The beef Khao Soi (egg noodles and beef in a coconutty curry sauce) was very rich and seemingly simple but had many layers of flavour and texture. The meat was stewed to perfect tenderness. The sauce itself was silky, creamy and packed lots of flavour.   

I had a nibble of the more familiar Pad Thai off my friend's plate and it was also quite good. 

There is not much else to say but that I am very impressed with what this place is all about. That is offering people their take on some traditional dishes at very affordable prices. I couldn't care less about the authenticity. They use simple and fresh ingredients all of which make a noticeable contribution towards a very complex and very tasty end product.    

Verdict: The food was just bang on and well worth the wait. I can't wait until the second trip."}
{"text":"Its frustrating to have to wait so long for a table, however the food is well worth it. 
Love the music and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was told to come here by many yelpers. Well it's nothing special. I can get this anywhere in NYC. It's certainly not worth the wait, are you kidding me? I was expecting something new and incredible. Nope, don't waste your time waiting, average food. 
And NO I didn't come here twice, WIFI city!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a sister restaurant of Sukho Thai on Parliament - same owner. Their khao soi with chicken is to die for. Mmm, it's so good that it's definitely worth the wait. Depending on when you go, the line to get a table can take up to 45 minutes. The venue is much larger than the restaurant on Parliament and the bar is very hip and trendy. This location is near King and Spadina and you would definitely overlook it if you didn't know it was there. Pro-tip: Know what you want to order when you sit down. Pro-tip 2: If you order take out and have parked a car, don't be a jerk and get the staff to bring the food to your car. I've seen that happen and it's just super lazy; as if the staff doesn't have enough to worry about. The owner is very friendly and even went around to ask about how our meal was. Excellent, will be back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing thai food but not so amazing service. You have to be there right around the time they open for dinner, otherwise the wait can be quite long. Try their pad thai and green curry!"}
{"text":"My first time coming here after hearing how good it is. I ordered the Three Flavours Pad Thai while my partner ordered the Khao Soi. I chose the veggie + tofu option for my pad thai - it was delicious. They had a generous portion of tender beef pieces in the khao soi but my partner enjoyed the one from Sukhothai better. The atmosphere was great, high ceilings, interesting design on the walls, friendly staff. We came here for lunch on Saturday and we didn't have to wait - I heard dinner is much busier."}
{"text":"Khao San Road was on my \"To-try\" list for the longest time. Of course, only when my twin sister was actually in Thailand was when I *HAD* to go here... 

My boyfriend and I walked in early for dinner and managed to grab two seats at the bar. We started with the squash fritters, which were good, but what made them spectacular was the sauce they were served with - I could have drank the stuff by the cup. I had the red curry as my main, and found the curry itself to be delicious and really well balanced, but personally didn't enjoy the large chunks of squash they used; I don't know if that's what they traditionally use in red curries in Thailand, but I kind of missed the typical tofu and bamboo shoots that I get at my local Thai spot. (Also love that they have a vegan dinner menu in addition to their regular menu, meaning that I could enjoy my meal without fear of eating anything tainted with fish sauce!) 

Sitting at the bar is always a bit of a gamble in terms of service, and service pretty much met my expectations here: not the friendliest or the fastest, but the job got done well enough. By the time we left, the dinner rush was in full swing and there was a long line out of the door of people waiting for a table. Listen carefully kids: get here early if you want delicious Thai food as they no longer take reservations!"}
{"text":"I've thoroughly enjoyed every meal I've had at Khao San Road. The street style pad thai and the squash fritters are incredible. The pad thai is slightly sweet with a nice kick; you can even choose to have it with tofu, beef, chicken, pork and shrimp. The squash fritters are crispy on the outside soft on the inside deep fried pieces of squash woven together like a funnel cake and served with an awesome lime ginger sauce.


The wait times for this place vary quite a bit; on my first visit, I was seated within 5 minutes (Tuesday at 5pm), whereas I waited 30 minutes on a Wednesday at 6pm. My advise would be if you can go right when they re-open for diner at 5pm it's usually better."}
{"text":"Went to Khao San Road today for the first time during lunch.
It is not a very big place and they have put as many seats as possible in a small area.
They also have few seats in a small patio outside.
I ordered pad gra prao with tofu and Medium spice level.
You can get tofu or pork or chicken added and its included in the cost of the dish.For Beef and shrimp, they charge extra.
The portion was small but enough for me to have at lunch.My colleague,on the other hand, felt that the portion should have been bigger.
I asked for hot sauce since I needed some more kick and their HOT SAUCE WAS TOO HOT that I almost had water in my eyes..WHoa,that was fun.
We also ordered the veggies spring rolls.One plate has 6 rolls and they are very very healthy and are a good appetizers and won't fill you up and ruin your appetite for main course.
Also,the music as very loud so we had to talk loudly to have conversation.

Overall ,a good place but nothing too extraordinary."}
{"text":"I'm a tourist visiting Toronto for a week, and I have been using Yelp to find most of my meals. This restaurant was by far the best meal I've had in during my stay. I had the massaman curry, which came in a large bowl with a side of rice. The curry broth was the best Thai I've ever had. It was creamy, sweet, spicy, and nutty at the same time. The wait was about a half an hour, and was certainly worth it. If you only have a few meals to eat in Toronto, this restaurant has to be on your list."}
{"text":"I've been to Khao San Road a bunch of times when it was at the Adelaide location and nothing much was changed when they moved to their current location on Charlotte Street. The menu is exactly the same, as was the food quality (which is a good thing). The new location is more spacious than before and has a large tiled walled once you walk in the door. There is more seating around the corner (high tables and stools) and there's a simple bar on the second floor that overlooks the floor below. Today for lunch, I ordered the pad gra prow. At $13, it's quite steep for stir fried ground pork or chicken (your choice) over white steamed rice. You can add a fried egg for $1, I didn't. The dish was very flavourful and I used all of the fish sauce with pieces of hot peppers that came with it. I went with the 'spicy level' and found it quite hot. When I order their pad thai, I always get it 'spicy' and it is definitely way spicier on the rice dish! If only the prices were a tad lower (and the music was turned down just a tad), I would go to Khao San Road every week!"}
{"text":"The best authentic tasting thai food in the gta.  I am from the pacific rim and i can honestly say this place takes the cake for flavour.  

Highly recommend this place.  Waitors are friendly and give off a free spirit billy talent look to them."}
{"text":"Khao San Road is, to the best of my knowledge, the greatest Thai place in Toronto.  The long-standing gem of the ever-expanding empire of husband-and-wife team Nuit and Jeff Regular, it's fairly inexpensive, always consistent, and packed wall-to-wall any time after 6 PM.  You'll find things here that are not only superior in their execution to anywhere else in Toronto (Pad Thai, Fresh Rolls), but that you also won't find anywhere else in the city to begin with.  I'm only aware of one non-Regular restaurant in Toronto serving Khao Soi, and it's terrible (search Yelp for the culprit).  The thai holy basil, which features in several dishes, is reputedly imported from Thailand, and imparts a range of flavor that's unmatched.  

The service can range from slow to snobbish, but is well worth some understanding.  If the front of house is having a bad night, take a deep breath and follow him on twitter anyways - he's one of the most ear-to-the-ground individuals in the city for new cuisine, and well worth keeping an eye on.  Pictures of the after-hours staff meals are a bonus and will make you want to quit your job to work here as a busboy.  

I haven't sampled the entire menu at Khao San Road despite frequenting it heavily, because I tend to crave the same things - Pad Gra Prao, the Khao Soi, and the rolls.  When taking people from out of town, or when tapped for advice by first-timers who seem to recognize that I've eaten here before and appear to know what I'm doing, I give two recommendations.  The first is the Pad Gra Prao, a simple minced meat dish spiked with holy basil.  Get it with pork, and order it spicy; the sweetness of the pork plays nicely with the heat.  On the flip side of the coin, order the Khao Soi with huge chunks of beef instead of the more traditional chicken, and request it mild to appreciate the silkiness of the curry broth and the sweetness of the coconut, as well as notes of lime.  Eat the Khao Soi first, then scale up the heat with the Pad Gra Prao.

The two Pad Thais here are both superb.  I've heard magical things about the appetizers that aren't the fresh rolls, but I've yet to stray beyond them myself.  Packed with carrots, greenery, and delightful house-made sausage, they're perfectly matched with the accompanying tamarind sauce.  I could eat them every day, or just keep eating them until I died.

As far as I'm concerned Khao San Road's one of Toronto's must-eat venues.  Try to arrive off peak, or get your phone number on the list and go grab coffee around the corner as you wait an hour or two for your table.  It's worth a bit of planning, or a bit more patience.

Also?  This place is awesome for gluten-free diners.  It's a celiac's wet dream, and they bend over backwards to accommodate customers with any and all dietary needs.  The Khao Soi with rice noodles instead of egg noodles?  Still amazing."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, it was the middle of winter, I heard this was the best place in town for Thai food and the wait time indicated that as well. We waited 2 hours!!!! We were cold and starving when finally got a seat. 

The food was decent, but it wasn't amazing, definitely not worth the 2 hour wait in the cold. The flavours seemed to be toned down, that's something I've noticed in a lot of restaurants in Toronto. For a South East Asian restaurant, I think it's unfortunate they chose to do that because South East Asian cuisine is all about bold flavours."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5 on a busy Wednesday for lunch. We didn't have to wait. Service was OK, not that attentive (bc it was really busy). I ordered the curry of the day with the breaded chicken appetizer. The chicken appetizer was very mediocre, just tasted like fried chicken chunks from KFC. The curry was good but the rice was cold. Not coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Have been here twice - both times I got the green curry chicken. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The curry base was aromatic and didn't fall flat on the tongue (unlike the curry at many downtown Thai restaurants that overpower their dishes with coconut milk). 

The prices are a bit steep compared to what I'm used to paying for curry (note: I grew up in markham), but I guess that's a downtown thing.."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out recently! I went to Sukothai ages ago, and I don't know why I waited so long for Khoa San Road.

We went right at 5 pm on a Tuesday so there was no long line to get in.  The place got busy very fast but the service was on-point and quite friendly. I really liked the atmosphere in here and the fun poppy tunes that were playing.  

The FOOD:

Garlic Chicken App - These panko breaded chicken chunks were fresh and tender and the potent garlic sauce that came with it was delicious!! This is a great app to share with the table but beware of the intense garlic flavour! 

Three Flavour Pad Thai - Def one of the best pad thai dishes in the city.  Fresh, hot, flavourful, big portion and a level 4 spiciness level. SO GOOD!

Green Curry with Chicken - This was a fantastic green curry with soft basil flavour and coconut milk. Again you can get this very spicy or very milk, depending on what you like.

Next time I'm trying the Khao Soi :P"}
{"text":"Long waits, crowded seating, really loud music. Not a great place to enjoy a meal and chat. Seemed very 'go here to be seen' type of environment. Tons of Queen Street skinny girls not eating much (the night I went).

The wine was $10 a glass. I ordered the Pad Thai that was greasy and bland. Usually I can take it home and eat it a bit later, but it turned into a pile of oil and hard noodles. My friend had the curry dish which was really good from the few bites I tried.

Not my scene at all. Maybe I would consider going back if I didn't have to wait in line, and it wasn't so loud and crowded. I definitely wouldn't be drinking wine or eating the pad thai again."}
{"text":"The line up was ridiculous for a Wednesday night,  the community table was crammed and uncomfortable.  The window was opened at the time so we were freezing.  Overall food was pretty good tho,  it's more a eat and go place rather than to chill and have a beer.  I'd definitely go again just for the food"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Khao San Road for years since they first opened in the old location. After I visited their newest location for the first time this week, I have to say the food is just as good!

The interior is exactly the different vibe compares to their previous location. The tall ceiling and the huge windows, you might need to wear your sunglasses when it is nice and sunny out!

Service was fast and friendly during my late lunch. And Khao San Road always make my favourite X Thai Spicy right! 

I will be back whenever I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Before Pai, there was Khao San Road. Back in the day when Chef Nuit was at the reigns, this place was King. But now, it seems that Pai has taken over, and to me, for good reason. The noodles here are dryer than they used to be and the flavour now pales in comparison to Pai. The Thai ice tea was also watery and didn't have the same mouth feel as it did before. Maybe it was an off day for them since there are so many good reviews still which makes me want to go again in the near future."}
{"text":"Their pad thai and green curry were perfection! Staff service varied. The caucasian female staff at the door taking reservations was extremely nice and helpful. Thank you for that. But the serving staff was mean / wasn't very helpful."}
{"text":"The best Thai I've ever had. The Khao Soi is superb. A spice level 3 is good for most. The Thai spicy is too spicy. So make sure you know what ur getting into."}
{"text":"So far the most authentic Thai food I've had in Toronto. Not super cheap and it was really and busy and loud (and there's communal seating which can be a negative), but overall delicious good. I got the 3 flavour pad thai and my husband got a curry and they were moth amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very different flavors from your regular Thai place. I've only eaten here once (man was it crowded) and gotten takeout a few times. The food never fails to be amazing.

Come early! You could be waiting a long time to get a table!"}
{"text":"Have to knock this down a star. I still take out from here on a very regular basis (at least once every couple weeks) because when KSR is on its game, there's nothing else remotely comparable in the area. However, I have encountered some major consistency issues lately. A downright awful Pad Thai tonight settled me on posting an update -- it was utterly, completely bland to the point I couldn't even finish it.

I also want to mention that 90% of the staff seems to have turned over since Chef Nuit left. Why do I care if I just do take-out? Because the new guy answering the phone is completely useless...he regularly sets it down for minutes at a time while taking your order so he can run off to do something else. This ties up the line for way longer than necessary, meaning that if you want to place a take-out order you'll probably have to call 5-10 times before you get through.

As a positive point of change, Chef Top has really turned the heat-meter to \"11\"...I used to order Extreme Thai Spicy with Chef Nuit and had no problems with it, but the new Extreme Thai Spicy is noticeably hotter and Top Spicy is unbearably hot...possibly the only dish I've ever had anywhere which is too spicy for me."}
{"text":"Good pad see ew, not good pad thai. Pad thai smells really weird and very different than a regular pad thai. Pad see ew is good. I ordered the beef one that has some interesting spice. They also weren't really quick in preparing food. It's a decent option for Thai food but to be honest, I haven't found good Thai place that has really good food. the beef in pad see ew is also better quality than other Thai places I have been to."}
{"text":"Decent place. The service was quick and the food was quite flavorful. However, the squash fritters are quite bland, and a bit (unpleasantly) oily. The servers do require a bit more training session since they not only seemed rushed, but a few times interrupted our table conversations with anecdotes (a tad rude, I think). Overall, an average thai joint."}
{"text":"It was super busy at 6pm and there was a 25 minute wait to even get seated at the bar. Super casual atmosphere therefore not much of a dining experience as they are trying to get people in and out as fast as possible. But I must admit the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"... I honestly just don't get it. I definitely don't have a problem with Khao San Road - the food is pretty decent and the service is good for the most part - but I just don't get the hype. On my most recent visit, I came with a group of 7, and we waited no lie for probably around an hour and a half just to get a table. I ordered the khao soi (noodles in golden curry) with beef and a thai iced tea. Honestly, thai iced tea probably just isn't my thing, because while this one was good I suppose, I found it to be way, way too sweet for my taste. I really did like the khao soi and would recommend it, as the portion size was quite substantial and overall the dish was very delicious with the noodles, coconut milk, crispy noodles, scallions, and coriander. At Khao San Road you can customize the level of spiciness, but apparently for curries you have to do at least mild, which I wasn't too thrilled with because I had originally wanted no spice. I didn't think the khao soi was too spicy, what with the coconut milk in the curry and all, but it started to build up a bit by the time I got to the end of my dish. 

Given the fact that there is ALWAYS a huge lineup to get in, I would expect it to be AMAZING, but for me it's just okay, so that's a bit of a letdown. And considering that it's just a casual dining place, I actually think it's a little pricey. My food + drink + tax and tip ended up being around $30 - I've definitely paid about the same amount or less at other places where I enjoyed the food or experience more. While I wouldn't have any problem returning here if someone else suggested it, I personally never have cravings for this place and my personal opinion is that it's just a bit overhyped and overrated."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal.
Great vibes in the restaurant.
Music is always on point.
Prices are affordable.
Did I mention the food?"}
{"text":"Khao San Road is known as the best Thai place in Toronto. The food was good, nothing to blame. However, when you are expecting the best Thai in Toronto, you would expect more.

The service is not great. On their menu, they mentioned they won't take back the ordered meal if it is too hot for you. I have asked my dish not to be spicy. However, it was a little bit spicy and the waitress (apparently it was the manager there), told me that they served what I have ordered and this is a typical Thai dish. You should have expected spice

{"text":"The best Thai food in Toronto in my opinion.
I'm usually not a fan of Thai so I don't know what this says for authenticity. However, I really enjoy how the food tastes and their ability to keep the flavors potent, but not overpowering.
If you're a fan of golden curry or something that tastes a little richer, then I suggest the khao soi. If you're a meat and rice lover, then go for the pad gra prao. And if you have no idea, then their three flavours pad thai is a success every time.
Their menu, especially for lunch, seems limited. But it all tastes so good I don't think it's a problem. I just wish they offered more options for their mains. Also tried their Thai iced tea which has condensed milk in it - really really sweet! I ended up diluting it with water and it tasted delicious.
A good thing about this place is that almost anything on the menu can substituted with tofu, so all your veg friends can eat here as well.
Even though there is a line up for this place, it usually isn't that long of a wait. Just be sure to approach the waitress as soon as you step in to put your name down."}
{"text":"Khao soi-amazing but i dont understand how people can drink the curry
green curry- YUMMMYYY
pad thai-too sweet 
mango salad-mangoes were ripe enough

service....ugh.. no comment (we had a group of 18) he messed up quite a bit. also we got our bills separated but 18% service was included and 16 of us also paid tip on top of the service...which was our fault but he could have said something. AND in the end he said we didnt pay for an item....and FINALLY he decides to check and found out it was his mistake. so paying extra tip on top of already included tip. i felt like he didnt deserve...

oh yeah the thai iced tea really hits the spot"}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! Food is reasonably priced too. The Spicy Beef Salad is next level.

Atmosphere is chilled, with some communal tables. Expect a wait if you go anywhere near prime time.

Andy Ricker if the Pok Pok dynatsy would be proud of what is happening her!"}
{"text":"I went at 7:30pm on a Monday evening, and the place was PACKED. Parties of two were told that they should expect a 20-30 minute wait, and larger parties were told that the wait could be up to 40 minutes. I was lucky, though, because I was by myself, and was seated at the bar after 10 minutes. 

The servers were very nice, but they were very  harassed It also took about half an hour for the food to come - the place should seriously hire more people.

I had a Khao Soi and the Garlic Chicken. The chicken was okay, and I probably won't order it again. However, the Khao Soi, a creamy yellow curry with chunks of of tender, fall-apart beef and egg noddles, was magnificent. 

Would definitely go back, but would make reservations if I was going with friends."}
{"text":"super awesome I loved it soooo  much .. 

would highly recommend

shout out to all  my peeps"}
{"text":"Great food! I hated the crappy 90's R&B soundtrack, but if that's the worst thing I can say about a place, it's all good in my books! The service was great and the food was delicious. I'm looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with hubby on Monday and this place was packed around 7pm! Staff were friendly, and welcoming. Food wasn't too bad either. Portion size was okay to the price you pay. 
I am giving this place a 4 because their green curry wasn't that good ( I have had better green curry before)."}
{"text":"The food is good, sometimes fantastic. The service somehow is disappointing. I understand that this is a busy place, so I'm mentally prepared for lineups, crowd & noises, slow service, etc. But I simply don't like the way the staff act as they are doing you a huge favor whenever accommodating a small request of yours."}
{"text":"It's official: best Thai restaurant I've been to thus far. Seriously, the food here is AMAZING. Okay first off I appreciate the fact that their staple dishes aren't the typical drunken noodles, pad Thai, mango sticky rice, blah. Borrrring. They are actually different and unique. My favorite is most definitely the khao soi, which is this phenomenal bowl of egg noodle in curry with your choice of meat, topped with crispy fried noodles. I've never had or even heard of anything like it at any other Thai places I've been to, so I don't know if it's their speciality or what? Anyway the different textures of the creamy curry sauce, buttery soft noodles, and crispy fried noodles pair so well together--it's seriously a must try if you come here!!! One of my other favorite (and unique) dishes that we had was the pad gra pao, which was full of flavor and just as amazing. We went for beef, and it paired so well with the rice and fried egg. Although the wait is long (expectedly) the kick butt food and upbeat atmosphere is so worth it."}
{"text":"The Yellow Curry is the best I have tasted anywhere in the world.  Try it Thai spicy!!!"}

{"text":"I fell in love with Khao San Road the day my boyfriend brought me to this little gem when It was located on Adelaide street.  It was close to winter and freezing cold but there was a lineup outside the restaurant and for the life of me I couldn't comprehend why.  I couldn't,  until I had my first bite of their famous Three Flavours Of Pad Thai and their Garlic Chicken. I would wait in a line up for hours to get a plate of that yummy scrumdidiliumcious goodness that feels like a first kiss on warm summer night.  Needless to say I was heartbroken, as if it were the end of a serious relationship when I showed up to get my kiss and their doors were closed.  I felt a mixture of feelings and I sat at their door weeping, not knowing what had happened to my best friend and partner in crime (calorie ridden food) Khao San.  After more than a year of waiting and hoping for it's return, my love has come back to me and after a date night yesterday, it was everything I remembered it to be and more.  Don't EVER leave me again!  Here's to creating many more memories!  You owe it to yourself to stop by and if you try nothing else, you HAVE to try two things and two things only.. THREE FLAVOURS OF PAD THAI AND THEIR GARLIC CHICKEN!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Khao San Road is probably my favourite in terms of Thai food in Toronto. I've been multiple times and each time, the food was on point. Golden curry is excellent, pad thai is also great and khao soi is good (personally not a fan of the noodles). Thai iced tea is so yummy but a bit pricey. My only complaint is the fact that they don't take reservations and I've had to wait an hour every time I've been here to be seated, and when I am seated it's a bit squishy...but I've got to say the food makes up for it since I've been back so many times!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai place, I always get Khao San from here. It's the first location but it's the best. Only downside is I want bread on the side to dip. Great atmosphere and decor. Waiting in line worth it."}
{"text":"We got the green curry with chicken and street style pad thai in medium spice. They were both pretty good although I've had better green curry in Toronto. We also got the squash fritters which were forgettable. I have no idea where all the recommendations for them are coming from. I also deducted a star becauase it's pretty pricy compared to other similar spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night right after work. Long wait, but totally worth it. Considering my last thai experience in the city was Salad King, this blew my mind.
Try the Panang Curry-its so well done.
You can taste the fresh basil in the dishes.
The milk tea is also really good, although it does fill you up."}
{"text":"I was visiting toronto and had just arrived. we were starving and couldn't stand another minute without food! After yelping around we decided to go for Khao San Road. Super convenient location (around the corner from our hotel) and it was super popular. Our hotel concierge said it was a good place but it would probably take us a while to get a table.

semi-discouraged, we tried it anyway because it was so close. There were multiple parties waiting outside on the narrowed side walk among the construction scaffolding. I approached the host who told us it would be about a 45 minute wait for three. I was just about to fall over from starvation and desperately asked if we could eat at the bar even (keep in mind, i didnt know they did take out or we would have done that too). The manager/owner looking dude came up to us and offered us the patio \"bar-like\" seating area, which I quickly jumped on! 

The space was ready for us in less than 5 minutes and we were fed and fed WELL! We had the shrimp chips to start, yummy but they're not the typical kind you get at chinese restaurants. I had the khao soi - curry w/ noodles w/ beef. The noodles were DELICIOUS as as the curry. The beef was a little on the tough side - i probably would go for the chicken instead or no meat at all. The curry sauce itself was wonderful!

Needless to say, i was completely stuffed and was thankful for the short walk back to the hotel for some digestion. Food was excellent and service was amazing! I love awesome food, i love great service, and i hate to wait so Khao San Road was JUST PERFECT!

i suspect the wait is often long and my experience may have been a fluke, but their willingness to get everyone at a table in a timely manner is greatly appreciated and noted! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Being Thai, I get pretty snobby sometimes in regards to my standards of Thai food. Knowing that this place caters to non-Thai's and that it's pretty trendy, I was surprised to find that their food is pretty damn close to tasting authentic. It wasn't overly sweet and everything had a nice balance of what I call the \"4 S's\" - Salty, Sour, Sweet, and Spicy. The balance of these 4 components make up many Thai dishes and when it's done well, it tastes amazing!

My friend and I came here shortly after they opened. She lives here and told me there's always a line so we made it a point to try and beat the rush. We arrived and got seated right away. We ordered Khao Soi and Bangkok Pad Thai and added on fresh rolls and a soup. 

I was really impressed with the soup. It was white but tasted just like Tom Kha soup which is typically a more orange/yellow color. We couldn't get enough of this! The fresh rolls were indeed fresh and i enjoyed those too. The khao soi and pad thai were both good, not the best i ever had, but good enough to understand why there was a line of people at the door. 

The menu is relatively small compared to most Thai places but I consider this to be a good thing so that they can focus on what they do well. Overall, I enjoyed the experience. It is a very busy restaurant and be prepared to wait unless you go at off-peak times."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great quality! After eating from here I have never been able to eat Thai food from anywhere else!!  It's a must go place and I'd recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Khao San Road is HOT in every sense of the word: it looks stunning, it's packed to the gills and it's mighty toasty in there. 

We almost walked by -- there is virtually no signage out front. The restaurant itself is a low-ceilinged space with dark black floors, modern furnishings, and bright haloten lighting. When crowded, there is a significant din and lively energy about the place.

Our host suggested a 30 minute wait when we entered but the lean and hungry couple ahead of us in line warned that they had been waiting over an hour. Looking around at the frenetic servers and bottles of wine on the tables we decided to put on our Patience Caps. Nearly an hour later were we sharing a sizable table with a trio of strangers and ready to order right away.

We started with the squash chips ($5) which are puffy crisps the size and shape of melted iPhones[1] (but thinner obvs) served with a tamarind sauce. These were tasty, but dangerously filling, so I backed off after eating about 98% of the basket. My DC ordered the Khao Soi ($13) a coconut curry garnished with crispy onions. 

The server was adamant she get the beef over the chicken; a good call. The beef was super tender and flavourful. Predictable me: I ordered the Special Pad Thai ($14) over the street style. It seemed like a no brainer to me: it comes with more stuff up to and including peanuts. I would definitely consider this one of the top variations of this dish I have had in the city. The chicken was PERFECTLY cooked and it was actually spicy. Yum! The servings were really sizable, and they win bonus points for providing plastic (over Styrofoam) takeout containers.

It has to be said that KSR is not equipped (psychologically or logistically) to handle their recent onslaught of attention. The servers were racing from the kitchen to tables, avoiding the eyes of any patrons that would distract them from their immediate goals. We spent most of the meal without place settings and my DC's Thai Ice Tea (a super sweet cold drink) took ages (and asking three different people) to fulfill. I'm not going to be too hard on them because they are just getting used to this dramatic surge in business and the food really does make up for it. It was a long wait, but we were all smiles after our meals.

Obligatory Title Pun: The ROAD is SAN / With many a winding KHAO.

Menu Readability: Tahoma?

Need to mention: Lunch is the same thing but cheaper.

What this place teaches me about myself: When it comes to Thai food I know what I likes. And that's Pad Thai.

[1] I swear I'm not a fanboi."}
{"text":"Ah, Khao San Road. The granddaddy of Toronto Thai restaurants and with good reason. I'd been to their old spot a few times and had predictably had my socks knocked off, but I'd never been to the Charlotte location before (mostly because the place is always packed when I walk by).

But I arrived around 5:30 on a weeknight, and although the place was indeed crowded, I was able to secure a table for two. Huzzah!

We decided to start with the Squash Fritters (\"kabocha squash, wild ginger, lemongrass, fresh matruk lime leaf, red curry, egg\") and they were fantastic. A plentiful portion, the fritters arrived to the table piping hot and accompanied by an addictive dipping sauce. I can't imagine a better way to start a meal.

My favorite dish ever is Pad Thai, so it's no surprised that I went with the Three Flavours Pad Thai (\"rice noodles, tamarind, egg, tofu, bean sprout, fresh roasted peanuts, shallot, chive, dried chili, lime, long leaf cilantro\") and I requested it Thai Spicy. It's just as good as I remember and certainly a strong contender for best Pad Thai in the city. (In my eyes, it's a neck-and-neck contest between Khao and Pai.) Everything about the dish was perfectly conceived and cooked, from the tender chicken to the various flavors to the scrumptious noodles. It really doesn't get much better than this.

Someday I'd love to try something else at Khao San Road, but it's almost impossible to say no to that exquisite Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Amazing food at an incredible price! The best Thai food in Toronto for sure. Come for lunch but be ready to wait in line."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Thursday while visiting Toronto. Everything we ordered was delicious. My boyfriend and I split the fresh rolls, papaya salad, Bangkok Pad Thai and a specialty curry dish. Friendly service, great location in the middle of everything, and great presentation.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, but unfortunately, I experienced bad service.

As I was already a fan of this restaurant group, I went in to try Khao San for the first time with friends. Four of us got seated at a big table, and after we ordered drinks and food, another friend wanted to join us. We asked our server if they could add one more chair to the same table. He said he would need to confirm with his supervisor. He came back after a couple minutes and said they usually don't allow this, but it is okay this time, brought a chair, and we thanked him.

After we told our friend that she could join us and when she was on her way, this supervisor lady came over furiously, and abruptly took the added chair without making any comments nor even looking at us. We thought it's probably some misunderstanding, and looked for our server. When he came back, he had tears in his eyes, explaining that the supervisor didn't confirm this but since she was busy he went ahead and gave us a chair, and that we could not have one more person at the table. At this point, our friend was already getting off the streetcar at the closest intersection, but there was nothing he could do.

I get that there was miscommunication between the server and the supervisor, but that's their problem. It shouldn't have been solved at the cost of the customers. In any types of business, who makes the client give up the services that they were assured for, because of the miscommunication on provider's end? I wouldn't blame the server, but the way this supervisor handled the situation was very poor. If the trainer's response is that immature, no wonder their servers cannot gain better customer service skills."}
{"text":"Brilliant thai food, they have a line up almost everyday for good reason.  Their yellow curry tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group   a few months ago and  I feel that this is one of the most authentic Thai restaurants in Toronto. The menu is well designed with  the Thai words and English side by side as well as the option to adjust spice levels .   We got 
 Massaman Curry which looked great and was packed with delicious flavours. 
Pad Grao Prao: We got this with chicken and were blown away by the tastiness. Just  order this dish
Garlic Shrimp: These were so amazing and the dipping sauce complimented the shrimp  really well. 

Ill end this by  telling you to  eat here  and enjoy some authentic Thai cuisine"}
{"text":"Food rating: 4
Service: 3
Atmosphere: 2
Wild Card: 1

I've heard such great things about Khao San Road and I wanted to try it out for a while.

We arrived 15 minutes early to find a huge line already waiting outside.  As soon as doors opened we figured there would be no spots left given where we were in line.  After waiting another 10 minutes until we got inside, there was either a space at the cramped bar or one spot left at a table kissing elbows with the person next to you.  We chose the cramped bar.  

The service was ok, the food was honestly great, we shared 3 dishes in total.  I had a huge portion of the pad thai in the 2nd spiciest option (we should have gotten the 3rd since my nose was crying from the heat).  I also ordered the Thai Iced Tea (my fav).     

 The only thing that left a really bad taste in our mouths was the fact that my husband got up to use the restroom and saw one of the kitchen staff members leave without washing his hands!  The staff uses the same bathroom as the patrons.  After we settled the check, my husband went to tell someone what he had seen, and by chance he spoke to a manager.  The manager had asked him to point to the staff member then seemed to have brushed it off.  I'm sure it was not his first time!  To be quite honest, I am sure it can happen anywhere, but once we have seen it for ourselves, we will never go back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai food place aside from restaurants in Thailand itself. The Thai ice tea is great. And it's amazing that they have so many levels of spice. The curries and the khao soi are the best!!"}
{"text":"I've been patiently waiting for Khao San Road to re-open. I was excited to try their dishes again. I walked in to a busy restaurant at 6pm on Saturday, but was fortunate that there was space at the bar. The interior feels very cramped, more so than at the previous location.

The menu is exactly the same as the old menu. I decided to order a pad gra prow and a Thai iced tea. I waited about 15 minutes for the food to arrive, but that's to be expected with a packed restaurant. The taste of the food has not change a bit. The pad gra prow was spicy and savory. I love the fried egg on top, especially when the yolk is mixed into the meat and rice. The cucumbers help cut the spice. The Thai iced tea is amazing. It's refreshing, rich, sweet, and has a very unique flavor.

I'll be back when I have an evening event in the area."}
{"text":"I've given it a few tries because of how much I used to love it (and I was waiting for them to re-open for a looooong while), but I won't anymore - just go to Pai instead (or maybe Kiin when it opens). 

They used to have the best pad thai (the Bangkok one, not the five flavours one) but it tasted bland when I ordered it. It doesn't make too much sense either as I had it at the Nana popup and it was still great then...

Another time I tried the Khao Soi (upgraded to beef) and it was decent, but the spice level was nowhere to be found (definitely not the same as Pai) despite ordering my normal level (3), the beef was VERY plentiful but one piece was nice and tender while the other 4 were tough and with some chunks of undercooked fat, and they didn't give me the pickled veggies I asked for. That was definitely not worth ~$17. Pai's & Salad King's versions are better.

On the plus side, if you do want takeout at least they have Ritual so its a significant improvement over the previous takeout process."}
{"text":"I've come here twice and so far I've tried the khao soi, khao yum, pad thai sam roas, and green curry. The wait was not too long (15-30m) considering the popularity and small size of the restaurant. 

You can easily tell that the chef is well aware of a good culinary experience and the importance of balance in flavours and texture of the dish which is apparent in the khao yum. It's basically one of the best interpretations of a thai dish I've had. The combination of the crispy rice and peanuts with the softness of other ingredients, while balancing the zest and spiciness of the ginger makes my palette reach a level close to -mind me-, an oral orgasm. 

This careful balance is yet again present in the khao soi which uses the crispiness of the noodle to balance out a heaviness/bloating sensation common in curries. The curry was really fragrant and brought out a rich roasted flavour that was pleasing at sight, scent, and taste. 

Most restaurants struggle to make an outstanding pad thai dish, mainly because of lacklustre noodles. Some try to elevate through the use of varying ingredients but misplace the importance of noodles, as it is the base of what the other ingredients need to stand out. The sam roas had was eloquently flavoured to bring an aromatic yet simple taste to the diner and the noodles strengthened the overall textural integrity of the dish.

I find that few people can truly appreciate the effortlessness yet strict discipline in enforcing a careful balance of texture and flavour in a dish, so this restaurant deserves much more praise.

Overall comments: fun and well thought out dishes, friendly but not overbearing servers, a little too tightly packed of a seating plan, \"hip\" décor"}
{"text":"Great food if you can wait in line , wasn't sure if they took reservations , but thought we'd give it a shot , after 1/2 hr wait which in retrospect wasn't too bad ,was worth the wait. Food was great , I love to share and would have wished portions just a bit bigger to do so. And timing of dishes could have been better ,I understand it was busy that night but all in all a good experience."}
{"text":"After several recommendations to eat at Khao San Raod I was fairly disappointed. Maybe it was my high expectations, but the food really let me down. 

The atmosphere is great. Energetic, fast, young. Its a great place to go with friends to keep things lively. 

The food however was nothing exciting. Very standard curries, green, yellow, red. Nothing exceptional to choose from on the menu and the taste is bland. The papaya salad didn't have fresh papaya. 

I'm still on the hunt for great thai in Toronto. Please let me know if you have some suggestions."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food I've ever had in my LIFE. I've never been to Thailand, but from reading other reviews (and my level of happiness while eating here) I have to believe it's not only delicious, but pretty damn authentic, too!

I came in on a Monday night, and the place was reasonably packed. Khao is small, with a bar and all communal tables - so don't expect an intimate individual experience. The vibe is great, though. The service is fast, the music is good and the FOOD. Right, did I mention the food??

My friend had been in before so took care of most of the ordering. We had a few recognizable favorites, like Green Papaya Salad and Fresh Rolls, but the highlight for me was the Khao Soi. It's an incredibly flavorful noodle curry with coconut milk and turmeric, and the most tender melt-in-your-mouth beef short ribs. I had this a week ago and my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Without a doubt, one of the best things I've ever eaten. 

Not like you need any more reviews telling you to go to Khao San Road, but what the hell: GO! I promise, you won't regret it. Especially if you order the Khao Soi.

...Okay, drooling again."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I really liked Khao San Road.  I would have missed it and not known it was a restaurant if my friend didn't take me there. It's a small restaurant and there's no sign in the front. 

The restaurant seems to have poor circulation. I think it's due to the amount of people and the low AC. 

If you do go on a hot day, I'd recommend their Cha nom yen. It's a thai style milk iced tea. It's really good, but it can get too sweet. If you find it a bit too sweet, just wait a bit and let the ice melt and dilute it before you drink it. 

Gra Bong is a dish I'd recommend for sharing. There's something about fried squash fritters that made me wanted to try it. And I'm glad I did. It's fried where outside is not too crispy, and inside is nice, soft and hot. And the spices they use on it is just right.

I tried the Gaeng Kaew Wan (green curry). It was good, but if you're sensitive to spicy food like I am, you'll feel your tongue burning after a few spoonsfuls with rice. But the flavors are all there, and you wanna continue even though your tongue is burning from the heat. 

My friend got the Khao Soi. I tried a bit from hers, and I am definitely ordering that when I go next time. It's like a bowl of tasty curry soup with noodles. so good.

I'd say take a chance and try this out. It's worth it, but just a heads up that it's really busy Friday and weekend nights, especially since the place is small, so expect a line up!"}
{"text":"I loved this spot! The food is awesome, lots and lots of flavours and spices. Unless you're ready to feel the \"HEAT\" order spicy (3) or medium. Thai spicy will burn your tongue."}
{"text":"If you're wanting to go here during lunch make sure you have time to wait. There is always a line up! But totally worth it. Fantastic Thai food, with great portions. Once we ordered our dishes came out rather quickly. If you go during the summer try and get a spot by the open window! They also have take out which is a great option if you order ahead a time and pick it up on your way home from work for dinner."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and I have to say that I'm pretty disappointed. I ordered the pad Thai and made it a combo for an additional three dollars. The place overall was pretty full but we were able to get a table in about 10 minutes. So the first thing that came out was the first spring rolls as part of my combo, it was very tasty there was nothing wrong with it. My wife is the Tom Yum soup with my combo. I have to say that it was very disappointing Because the button mushrooms and tomatoes were not hot or even  warm,  It was literally as they put the vegetables into the pot, before allowing the liquid to boil, I just labeled it into my bowl and serve it to me. It was pretty bad.  I've never had this happen before. 
I sent it back and they brought me a new bowl that was heated all the way through as it should have been the first place. Then I got my chicken pot pie and I have to say that it was a tad too sweet. It also didn't come with any peanuts, lime, or bean sprouts So it didn't have that crunch and freshness that the Sprouts add, or the acidity from the lime. I had to ask for these which they brought out. 
If this was my First visit I would have a very poor idea of KSR, and I totally would not think it lives up to its hype. However I have been here before and I know how great the quality of food is...I'm in no rush to head back."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food places Toronto downtown has to offer. Most definitely recommend their Khao Soi!
Only downside - they dont take reservations and it is a pain to get a table during weekends. Even the takeout can take upto 45 minutes -but the food is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I took the vegan pad gra prao and the it was delicious. The thai beer was pretty good too. I highly recommend this restaurant and I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a welcome addition to Toronto's restaurant options.  We had three dishes: pad thai, a green curry, and coconut garlic shrimp as appetizer + a bottle of viognier.  The phad thai was good but not incredible-- partly because it contained a lot of coriander which is like soap to me.  The green curry was exceptionally good, very light but flavourful.  The coconut garlic shrimp was good, but it was the last thing to arrive at our table, despite being an appetizer.  We ordered all the dishes very spicy, and they were, thankfully.   The decor is nice industrial bistro style- chalk boards, rough hewn wood, and brushed steel. Good music.  On the whole the place has a fun vibe and good, reasonably priced fare.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"We got here after it closed on a Friday night (past 10pm) and Jeff, the owner, was still so nice and accommodating! Since we had driven such a long way, he asked the chefs if they'd mind cooking a few more easy dishes for us as they were already swamped with orders, and they agreed! So all in all- great manager, awesome customer service, and amazing food! Very impressed with this place and its staff!"}
{"text":"Quality of the food is 11/10! (Not a typo) It is very flavourful. This place doesn't take reservations, so you might need to wait for a couple of hours. But it's absolutely worth the wait. It's best not to bring a large group of people there, because they don't have a lot of seating area. If you come with a lot of people, you'll have to wait for a really really long time."}
{"text":"THE BEST thai food i've ever had! i was with 5 other people and they all agreed it was the best thai food and we are from NYC where culture and food are very diverse. Ive had my share of thai food and i cannot rave about this place anymore. i ordered the panang with spice level being thai spicy and it was perfect for me. the waiter was very on point about how spicy everything would be. my friends all ordered different curry dishes also. I tried some of theirs and it was DELICIOUS! their thai ice tea was a bit on the milkier side and less tea but im a sweets person so it was good for me. The dessert with the tapioca and coconut milk was served warm which was also very delicious. This place was amazing! glad i came here during my stay in canada!"}
{"text":"This place is on point.

Fairly busy.

Everything has really good flavour with a balance.

Would return soon!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had.  I feel like we ordered the whole menu and everything was delicious.  The door lady was very rude though, she had one of my friends fuming.  She gave away our table without really checking, we were right outside the door because no one was allowed to wait inside as it's a fire hazard.  We were freezing our butts off!  But on the inside the service was very good."}
{"text":"I am a fan. The food is excellent, and I love the ambience and it has a coolness factor to it. Great for lunches too but its super busy... $9 lunch curry. I also really enjoy their khao soi.

Also, great for late night eats too in downtown toronto, for those cool dark clear nights, loud music, food, and maybe a drink."}
{"text":"I used to love Khao San Road at the old location. They were closed for awhile and then changed locations when they re-opened. I have to say, I was not a huge fan of the new location. I visited on a Friday night, they were essentially out of everything I wanted to order (beef and chicken were both out for the entire night??) I settled with pork pad gra prao in the end, while my dining companion had a pad Thai. The food was just ok... I prefer the same dishes from the nearby Pai. Overall, it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place did not live up to the hype. Quite disappointed . 

Firstly, I was meeting up with a friend at the restaurant and I arrived a few minutes early so I wanted to go ahead and take a seat, but was then told that all parties must arrive...fair enough, but then upon my friends arrival, I noticed the man sitting near us was alone and not taking any orders. Strange right? 20 minutes or so later, 2 more parties arrive. Wow...I thought \"all parties must arrive?!\" my friend and I were very confused here. Definitely not a good feeling when I was denied seating until friend arrived. (The place was not packed that day by the way)

Secondly, the food. We tried the Pad gra gow and Khao soi in \"Medium\" spiciness.
The pad gra gow was alright but nothing to go \"crazy\" for. I feel like I can make something like that at home but better... the flavour was missing something...after couple taste it got bland and couldn't finish it. The khao soi was a bit disappointing. There were a lot of noodles and not much ingredients. I managed to find the chicken but the chicken didn't have much flavour to it. The soup itself lacked in broth. It was like curry soup but flavour lacked \"umami\" (aka flavour). Again, after couple sips it just got bland and boring. 

Waitress was cordial. It was our first time there so we were hoping we get a bit more explanation about what all the hype is about, what's popular etc.

Oh and the Thai iced tea was WAY TOO SWEET.

Overall, nothing we order stood out. No \"wow\" factor. We had a lot of leftovers and didn't really want to take any home...
I did not try the pad Thai yet but I've tried better Thai food elsewhere (and for cheaper price) so who knows if I'll come back..."}
{"text":"The fact that my wife and I have not had better pad thai after eating in over 25 locations in north america and also after eating at the highest rated places in thailand says it all. This is the only place we'd ever wait in line for."}
{"text":"Great variety of food! Good staple- pad Thai- my go to order for every new Thai restaurant I go to.  Their signature starter dishes are great as well!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food on earth is found on the streets of Thailand.  This is as close as I've gotten to that experience.  I only wish it was for the same price.

Always a long wait and they don't take reservations.  Give your name and they'll let you know when to come back.  Good chance to go to Chapter's nearby and catch up on reading."}
{"text":"Summary: a good-tasting, average size portion, a bit pricy famous thai food place in Toronto

I have been in Khao San Road many times at its old location. For old location, there is usually a lineup, even during lunch time. Now it is at new location with bigger space. The foods tastes still as long as before.
A group of us came here during lunch time. The lunch here is a bit cheaper than its regular menu. I order pad thai. The portion is average size, however, I could not finish it at the end.
The place and Thai are the two famous and popular thai food place in Toronto. However, I like this place better because I think it tastes better.

I recommend to go here during weekday lunch for the lunch special."}
{"text":"Most delicious Thai food I've ever had and love the gluten-free menu AND dairy free options. Yum yum."}
{"text":"This review is for the vegan menu! But all aspects of Khao San Road get five stars from me. I usually don't care very much about service and ambiance at restaurants, I go out to eat for the food, but I have to say that our servers were so attentive and sweet! We ordered our food \"Thai spicy\" and never had to worry about running out of water, because somebody would always be over to fill up our glass before it ever got even halfway empty. We got there at 5:15 on a Thursday, and the restaurant was relatively empty, but even after it filled up, service was perfect and prompt. Music was also great! They were playing Blame Game when we sat down and it was awesome. After more people arrived, the restaurant could get a little loud at times I guess, but whatever, I'm young and hip and stuff. 

THE FOOD WAS PERFECT. We ordered the squash fritters for our appetizer, and they were delicious and crispy, with a really good sort of sweet-sour-cilantro tasting sauce on the side. They weren't soft fried patties like I had expected, but more like the kabocha had been julienned, *very* lightly smushed together, and then fried, so that each individual strip was delicious and crunchy. There's a picture attached because I'm not doing them justice. 

For our main courses we ordered the vegan green curry fried rice and vegan khao soi (which happen to be two of my favorite dishes). I love, love spicy food, and I probably would have ordered level 8 or (maybe) even 11 if I was on my own, but my partner wanted to go slightly lower-key, so we ordered everything level 6 and I asked if they could bring some chilies on the side as well. On its own, the level of spice was exactly what I expect from \"Thai spicy.\" Slow burning heat, really fresh (there were lots of beautiful green Thai chilies scattered through the rice), allllmost overwhelming but not quite. With the rice, which I ordered, they gave me a beautiful dish of Thai chilies in a dark, salty \"fish sauce.\" I LOVE this condiment and I can hardly ever order or use it at Thai restaurants because it is usually in, duh, fish sauce!  it just made the meal totally perfect. The khao soi came with lime and dark chili flakes in oil, as well as pickled leafy veggies (maybe mustard stems? idk) we requested. I absolutely loved it as well but I can't stop freaking out about how exactly perfect the green curry fried rice was. 

My last note is that it is a little bit pricier than most of the Thai places I usually go to, but it's right downtown and absolutely amazing, so definitely do consider it for a nice night out. I can't wait to go back; I just want to try everything!! I've been to Toronto a few times and eaten at quite a lot of its Thai restaurants, and this has been my favorite place here, maybe my favorite Thai food...ever? So that's it!"}
{"text":"Came as a group of 4, and we ordered 4 dishes to share! I highly recommend sharing if possible, because eating a giant plate of pad thai by yourself can definitely be overwhelming (although it seems like a good idea at first).

We ordered the Bangkok style pad thai, three flavours pad thai, massaman curry, and the red curry (all of them medium spicy). We all received sharing plates. 

I was really excited to try both pad thai dishes to compare them, but they basically tasted the same (most the ingredients are the same anyways), except the three flavours version was a bit more spicy? I also love how the red curry has kabocha squash! 

We came at 6 on a Saturday and waited 10 minutes. Service was kind of slow. I dislike how you can't put yourself on the waitlist until all parties are there."}
{"text":"Okay, okay. So it's busy, and loud and crammed (to be read as communally intimate). But oh so so so worth the wait and the elbow-rubbing in and out of your seat.

The food is delicious. Green curry, red curry, panang curry, massaman curry (okay, so I love curry, you got it!) AND the pad thai AND the khao soi - all so yummy in my tummy. And it's all spiced well without compromising flavours.

Wait staff and patrons have always been nothing but pleasant. You get a little bit more attention at the bar than on a corner table, but most of the time you'll be too lost in sampling the best thai food in Toronto (I kid you not) and competing with your vocal cords in this always-full restaurant.

All of which makes for a great date night. Without breaking the bank. Cha-ching!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food. Luckily, when I came here during the busy lunch hours, I was seated right away.

I had the Curry of the Day (Panang Curry) and had an order of thai iced tea.   Both were delicious though the portions, in my opinion, were quite small.  If you're really hungry, you'd be better ordering one of the other dishes since the portions just look bigger in general. 

It's definitely a place I'd come back to if I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"Our friends had recommended us to come to this place. We made a reservation and even though we came here at 6:15 on a Wednesday night, still had to wait an hour for a table. We decided to go to a local bar and get a drink, so it wasn't too bad. When we got there, we were seated and presented the menus. The server was polite and quick. Most of us ordered the pad thai that they recommended. I do not like spice, so I got the most mild one there was. It had no spice at all, which is exactly what I had requested. Honestly it was almost a bit bland though, so maybe I should have tried the first spice. Oh well. Others really liked their food as well. Pretty good amount of food for the price and service was quick. Just be ready for a wait before you are seated."}
{"text":"too expense for the quality of the food. service is alright. Had a pad thai and add shrimp. the pad thai costed 17 and the extra shrimp costed $4???all i get is 3 crappy shrimp, really a thai express like quality food charge this much??"}
{"text":"Came with a friend for a nice cheap dinner.  This was recommended by @fivetwelve 

We chose their regular pad thai with shrimp (the first thing on the noodles menu) because it had a few other ingredients and our waiter said it can be made with no spice.

The food was great, it was a nice sized meal for two people to share on a budget.  The only problem was it was very spicy, but it was still oh-so-yummy.  Every bite was both pleasurable and painful at the same time.

The server apologized for the spiciness and offered us some complimentary dessert and wine.  My friend got the wine.  I had the dessert which was tapioca in coconut milk with real coconut meat.  The thing really simmered down my mouth.

Overall the service was excellent, and I will DEFINITELY go there again, but I may try the street style pad thai  instead.  Or I may try again with the dish because it was really great, but ask them to hold of on the spice and the chilli flakes."}
{"text":"I have heard about khao San road for a long time. I tried to go when it was still at he Adelaide location but the lineup was too long then. So I was kind of excited to have a chance again when my friend suggested it at its new location on charlotte street. The two of us didn't have to wait too too long (we were told that we can be seated in 20 minutes. It was 630 pm on a Wednesday). Nice thing was that you can wait upstairs at the bar (different restaurant but have yummy satay), have a drink and then they will call you on your cell. 
However the experience was not as pleasant. The restaurant was busy. There are only a few tables. Most are communal tables. We were squeezed between 2 other groups at a table (total of 9 people at our table). It was really loud (plus you are listening to the other group's conversation. 
Food was pretty good. We had the papaya salad, pad Thai and a rice dish. Decent quality. But it surprised me a bit that bill came to $52 (before tips. We had water).  
The food was good enough but there are other places like Sabai Sabai Kitchen and Bar that is better, costs less and have your own table."}
{"text":"As a Thai person (born and raised in Thailand), I can 100% vouch for their Pad krapow (minced pork with basil leaves) because they use REAL holy basil (and not the other type grown here...). I even met a Thai chef from another Thai restaurant who told me that they are the only place with the real holy basil.

However, the Pad Thai here wasn't good at all but pretty much all non-Thais were eating it so to each their own. The curry was pretty good and although I don't eat Kow-soi in general, apparently it's good, too.

Basically I only go here for pad krapow. Make sure it comes with sunny side up egg and the side of fish sauce/lime juice/chili. yum!"}
{"text":"Your standard Thai fare, nothing worth lining up for. Tried the pad Thai, way too much sat, like drinking seawater.  Not worth the hype.  Portions are small, mains are more like tapa sized.  Thai food from hole in the walls equally suffice."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great atmosphere. Must try. 
Things were a little buttery and my husband complained that if you add this much butter to anything, it'll taste great. But there's no such thing as too much butter for me."}
{"text":"I ate a late lunch here. The Pad Thai was excellent. It was fresh, tofu was firm and veggies crisp. Atmosphere was relaxed and service good. Nice open cd pace with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Big fan - fun space, great location, and buzzing with energy. Don't love the wait but it's the best Thai food in the area (Sukhothai is still the champ).

Get curry, any curry. Massaman is my go-to. Be advised that spice levels here are Thai spicy, so medium is about what you'd expect hot to be anywhere else.

Protip: be nice to the host and they'll call you when your reservation is coming up. That way you can duck out for a half hour while you wait."}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai food I've ever had and my girlfriend agrees."}
{"text":"Great food. Must have patience to wait for a table on the weekend. Well worh it."}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype here.  It is a pretty good thai place but service was so so.  They missed one of our order and could not redo it because the kitchen was closed by then.  We asked for bill and he forgot about that as well.  Also, our waiter had a thick foam line on his lips which wasn't appertizing view.  He should drink some water or wipe it off.
We had the main daily soup (white cocconut soup) which was pretty tasty but not spicy at all (we asked thai spicy for all our dishes).  We ordered pad kee mao noodle which never came out.  We had pad gra prao shrimp which was very good.  One thing that I would like to give credit where it is due is that it was spicy but tasty.  But, I wish it was more consistant.  We had massaman curry and it is supposed to be same spiciness as the pad gra prao but wasn't spicy at all.  Overall, this place certainly does not justify the hour long wait and high price.  There are other choices like golden thai."}
{"text":"This place gets busy really fast, so you have to wait in line for your turn OR find a time slot that it's slow. Usually I go on a Saturday around 11:30ish and it's semi busy. It's good food, service, and environment."}
{"text":"The type on this place is high, but well warranted. 
I recently went on a warm Thursday evening around 7:30 pm, so I wasn't surprised to see a large group of people waiting outside for their tables. Everyone looks ridiculous waiting on the sidewalk (unfortunately the restaurant is small and there is no room to wait at the bar), but the wait is worth it. A group of five of us all had great meals...yummy aps and really really good Pad Thai...best I've had in some time. The spice rating system is legit, so don't over order your spice just cause you think you're tough. 
Somewhat pricey, but all worth it."}
{"text":"Staffs were friendly, and service was good. I didn't have to waitbfor a table so that was a plus. I had the Three flavour pad Thai (recommended by our server) and the Thai tea. My friend ordered the Khao Soi. It wasn't a long wait for the food, and the portion size was perfect. I love eating and I can eat a lot so I was surprised the pad Thai filled me up. I tried some of my friend's dish, which was good but I found it to sweet for my liking. If you're a huge coconut fan, go for it, it's really rich in flavours. Skip the Thai tea or share it with a friend. I found it too sweet and way too large for one person to consume."}
{"text":"I checked out some of the bar food in the newly opened upstairs bar Bang Sue.   By far my favourite thing was the steak tartare on shrimp chips.  Also try their desserts for something different.  Its a cool place to hang out but be prepared for the hard wood seats if you are staying for a while."}
{"text":"I've been to Khao San three times now, and sampled the majority of the menu at various spice levels. As everyone says, this place has amazing Thai food, but I think I landed on my favorite dish on my last visit - the massaman curry. It was one of the most uniquely tasting dishes I've had in some time: sweet, nutty, tangy, spicy all at once. A few people at my table didn't like it as much as I did, but if you're looking for something a little different, I dare you to give it a try. The crowd favorite Khao Soi is great, both with beef or chicken. Be forewarned that the beef chunks are massive - not what I was expecting, but delicious nonetheless! Going a little backwards here, but the Squash Fritter appetizer is also a must-try. The pieces are huge, and it's fun to pull apart and dip in the chili sauce - almost like a bloomin' onion.

The portions are large, so you'll probably go home with leftovers, making Khao San pretty affordable! The service is friendly and they get the food out quickly considering how busy they can get. I also really like the vibe in this place: the art is a little quirky and the seating arrangement could you have you sitting next to another party, but it adds to the charm. And yes, there is almost always a wait, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Khan San Road is absolutely fantastic! Expect a wait but it's well worth it. From the beautiful interior to the amazing eats, you're sure to have a hell of a time! Everything I've eaten there has been amazing and has left me hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Very busy place but great service and delicious dishes! Traditional Thai of all flavours!"}
{"text":"First time I went to Khao San Road, I ordered a medium and received an extremely spicy Pad Thai, I figured this was a mistake.

Next time I was in Toronto, I gave them another try, and this dish was perfect.  Got the ad Thai again, and this was arguably the best Thai I have had.  5 Stars.  Get there early as it fills up quickly!"}
{"text":"Khao San Road is back and has moved into a shiny new glass box. Fortunately, it's menu remains the same and retains all of the items that made it a foodie legend in the past. 

This new joint also recaptures the noisy and electric atmosphere of the original. The communal seating returns along with the blaring speakers. The long wait times, however, are still a norm here. Make sure to show up with your full party or the host will not seat you. 

The number one reason to eat here, in my opinion, is their signature Three Flavours Pad Thai. Probably the best pad thai in Toronto, this dish comes perfectly drenched in sauce that is tangy and sweet and oh so delicious. The Bangkok style pad thai is more ordinary in flavour and just not as amazing, Imo. Stick to the three flavour one =) 

Their other dishes, however, are equally impressive and satisfying. The Crispy Rice Salad is another signature dish they serve here that leaves a lasting impression. Be warned though, it is more filling than it looks and can work a number on your jaws (really crunchy). I would recommend splitting this app with 4 people even. 

If there's one dish I wouldn't recommend, however, it would probably be the Khao Soi. Not that it's a bad dish, it just pales in comparison to the one at Pai (not as creamy and delicious). Otherwise, I think you really can't go wrong with their menu!"}
{"text":"food was excellent, ordered the khao soi and the pad see ew. the khao soi was definitely one of the best, if not the best, i have had in toronto. communal seating made it kind of hard to have a conversation without having to shout but i'd be much happier just eating the delicious food. the wait times do leave quite a bit to be desired so get there early."}
{"text":"Hidden gem restaurant in Toronto**** ! Live in NYC for many years and have been spoiled in that delicious and fine food world, so it's hard to surprise me! Came to visit Toronto many times over pass couple years, I feel sad for ppl live here ...hahaha! Apologize if I offend any Torontoniens! 

Anyhow, Khao Sam Road have brighten up the Toronto dinning! It's authentic, delicious and not about \" business\" or \"pick a quick lunch coz winter is so cold\" kind soul-less food. 

KHAO SOI -aka: Best Curry Noodle Soup in the world. Really rich and flavorful curry sauce soak into every bite of the noodle! Tendering and NOT-STINGY portion of beef chunks + crispy fried noodle on top! It's a layered of texture and flavor explosive . 

Thai tea AWESOME
fresh roll: refreshing 
3 flavor Pad Thai: GOOOOOD

I Heard that if u don't get there early, u have to line up ! So get there on time and get ur crew on time ~  :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a Friday for dinner. She told me to be there at 5 pm sharp or we would have to wait. I ended up showing up at 5:02 pm and she gave me shit. We didn't have to wait, she was wrong. I win. We were seated at the bar, chit chatted. And bam, a few minutes later, the place was packed.

Still, we placed our order just as the place filled up, and our food came quickly. We ordered the shrimp chips to start, the red curry with beef, and the three flavors pad thai with chicken both at medium spicy level. 

We also got a sweet white goupy thing with tapioca balls at the end that was too sweet for me. I wouldn't recommend that. Unless you're into that sorta thing. But man, everything else was the bomb. Them little shrimp chips were crack-like in addiction. There was a generous portion but I felt like I could have devoured two more plates of it. Danger bay! The red curry was some of the finest curry I've eaten, and I eat a non tiny amount of curry fairly frequently. The spices were nicely balanced  and to my surprise the kobocha squash really made the dish. And my gawd that three flavors pad thai. I could nom nom nom that sheisse every day. It was better than any pad thai I've ever had including the pad thai in Thailand. Disclaimer: I am not a pad thai connoisseur, so if you don't agree I am still cooler than you."}
{"text":"Decided to come here since I was craving some Thai cuisine. I ordered the Bangkok-style chicken pad Thai and let me tell you, the order took FOREVER to come. The restaurant wasn't even that busy, a few empty tables that night and it still took around 40 minutes for our food to arrive. Not sure if the server forgot to enter our order or whatever but I was getting pretty hangry. To be honest, the food was not worth the wait at all. From what I remember, there was a lack of flavour and wasn't really interesting. I definitely had better pad Thai at other restaurants. I wonder why they were taking so long to make the food since they don't accept substitutes anyways. The layout of the restaurant is really weird too. The front of the restaurant goes really skinny and there's more seating near the back. Overall, I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Probably the best food I've tried in a long while! I tried the menu from the second floor and it was delicious, but the food on main floor is out of this world! I could eat there everyday!"}
{"text":"The only problem I had with his place is that I did not know which dish to order!! There was so much to choose for and I knew that what ever I ordered I would miss out on several other tempting dishes, I suppose this mean that I have to go back several times. 
The food was delicious, the service was great and the price was reasonable. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"best thai food i've ever had in the GTA!

Had the Pad Thai with the combo upgrade which includes a Tom Yum soup and a spring roll. The spring roll dip was soooo yummy. I definitely recommend getting the combo.

The Pad Thai was probably the best i've had around... not the ketchup-y version you find in most so-called \"Thai\" restaurants in Toronto. It's more on the savoury side than sweet, which i love. It's not red or orange. I also asked for it to be extremely spicy and they got it just right. If you like it really spicy, ask for \"Thai spicy\". The chicken was also really tender, not dry.

The portion was big, I had to take almost half of my Pad Thai to go. Yay, tomorrow's lunch for me.

I had the Thai Iced Tea, it was good, although a bit too sweet for my taste. Still good though.

The place was a bit small, so if you're going at lunch hours, I'd recommend coming in a bit early, before it gets packed, so you don't have to wait long. My friend and I ate by the bar, so we were seated right away.

I didn't go to the washroom, so I won't be able to comment on that. The restaurant was clean and pretty chill.

The servers are great and quick. Didn't have to wait long for the food or more napkins and all.

Overall, I think it's the most authentic tasting Thai restaurant i've ever been to. It's my new fave for sure. Definitely my go-to Thai place now. My friend said the same thing about the food and we've both been to many Thai restaurants before."}
{"text":"You can definitely taste the difference since Chef Nuit left. Their new location is pretty and their playlist is always on point. Food is just ok and their Thai iced tea is wayyyyy too sweet."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite in Toronto. Food and service is amazing. The place gets really packed and sometimes it's hard for you to hear your conversation with your company (it's too popular that no seat is left empty). If you want to avoid busy hours, try going there a little after lunch or before dinner time. 
Sam roas pad Thai and garlic chicken are must try items!"}
{"text":"The best place for thai food in downtown Toronto. I have never been disappointed during my numerous visits.

Great food, consistent taste, quality and freshness; decent ambience; boisterous, noisy, crowded ambience; brisk and unpretentious service.

Even for a guy who loves spicy food, I usually settle for spice level -3(medium) or 4(spicy); never tried there top 3 spice levels: 6; 8 or 11 etc.

Try to avoid peak hours on weekdays during lunch and weekends during dinner. If you go a bit early you will get great service; food however is always great."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited this restaurant on a Sunday night. There was a wait and we understood the restaurant was busy. We put in our order and received the appetizer (garlic tofu) which was tasty. 40 minutes later, our waiter offered us the same appetizer again. When we finally got our entrees, my sister's dish (Tofu Massaman curry) continued potatoes and tofu, nothing else. Our waiter told us that was standard in vegetarian curry.

The two stars instead of one is because the food was flavorful. But aside from the service blunder, the accompanying attitude was a bummer. Where we live in New York and Chicago, there would have been a free drink and probably an apology ... but maybe we just couldn't hear it over the indie pop from 2007."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends because one of my friend's said it was really good. Went on a Saturday night, and it was packed. The wait was about 30 minutes for a table for 6 so wasn't too bad. Only bad thing was we got the one of the two tables that they couldn't serve alcohol. So no alcohol for the night was a little bit saddening, but it was a summer saturday evening so who's complaining. The food and service was pretty good, the only problem is they screwed up one of my friend's orders and it wasn't as spicy as he had hoped(He asked for a spicy and they served a mild). Ah well there's always next time I guess."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of my summer in Bangkok. Truly authentic cuisine with a great industrial and alternative ambiance and decor. Had the green curry fried rice and may have made it a tad too spicy, but it was delicious. Reminded me of my summer in Bangkok, which as mentioned previously, I totally visited. Service was great and it didn't take too long to seat us. Overall a cool and fun vibe with some great eats. Good location for a casual night out with friends."}
{"text":"On the plus side: Excellent Thai food, good flavour balance and spicy if you ask them for it.

On the negative side: very loud and crowded most times.  For that reason I tend to avoid it."}
