{"text":"The benefit of this place is clear... dumplings in the West-Island. It's a nice change from the banal restaurants that typically serve the same frozen slop in the West. But I feel they didn't do their homework. If you've had dumplings anywhere else, you'll notice a slight lack of authenticity that you wouldn't expect from a restaurant that specializes in dumplings. I believe in voting with your dollar, so I don't recommend this restaurant more than a last case resort, for the moment . Here's why: ambiance is clean and fresh, but cold with no character- picture an Asian McCafe or ThaiGrill(except higher cost of meal). They play radio music, (while you spend 30$ per person) as if it's a diner. The dumplings are machine pressed, not handmade, which does effect the texture and some would say they taste frozen, but apparently they're not. So are they freshly made, in house? Hard to tell. They have less volume of filling per dumpling and less dumplings per plate. You get 12 instead of classic 15 or 16 count. Plus, you pay more. Let's say for Lamb dumplings you'll pay 3$-4$ extra than the average city price. Also, you are charged for tea at this restaurant, which is borderline insulting and a big dissapointment. In similar restos that are authenitic, the tea comes automiatically with your meal (unlimited refills). In the end, you pay about double you would at any other dumpling house. It was a shock to pay 25-30$ for the same order that costs me 12$ in Chinatown. Cost us 145$ for four, tax and tip in!!! If you live in the W-I, it's cheaper to drive to Chinatown and have the real deal. Also, found it funny that they serve string beans as a \"side\" with the dumplings (which is why they will argue they charge more than competitors). Please just leave them out and charge the market price. I wish I took a picture of those sorry looking string beans with sauce, because they do not look so good when they're not stylized like in the picture. About dessert: The mochi ice cream was fun though. Basically, it's like a fruity icecream testicle. (Same technique used as with the mochi pastries- rice paper shell). Also, it's clear that the owners/employees of this restaurant dropped reviews here. Why didn't the Yelp filter catch them..."}
{"text":"Decent place for lunch if you crave for dumplings in the West Island. There are not much alternative in the area."}
{"text":"Great dumpling be careful with the spice it increases I the soup but overall I liked it"}
{"text":"I went here this evening with my girlfriend.  I was excited about a new restaurant in my neighbourhood that serves dumplings.  At fist glance the menu look inspiring, but the food was far from that. We started with the recommended dumpling soup, it was tasteless and bland. Then I had a combination of chicken/ shrimp and lamb dumplings, tasteless as well, I have a suspicion they were frozen. Even the sauces they offer on the table are terrible. Any chinese restaurant offer much better dumplings at much less cost. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is crap! 

Look in the kitchen window and you can the chefs(?) taking the dumplings out of the freezer.

The service is lousy...if your lucky you can watch the owner sit in the corner and do nothing as you try to get someone's ( anyone, for god sakes acknowledge us) attention. 

The first time we went we waited for almost an hour...we were seated, finally ordered and then waited. After many repeated requests we got our tea, an hour later some very unremarkable dumplings. We did take out the second time and they fared no better. 

If you crave dumplings go to any one of the many Chinese grocery stores  buy some frozen dumplings and steam them yourself.

Do yourself a favour and skip it! 

It is not worthy of one star but i cannot award zero."}
{"text":"So we were hoping that we can find a dumpling place near to our home. Found out about this place on yelp but I guess who ever rated this place has not ben to china. When it comes to rating chinese places I am harsh!!! Sorry!!!
This place got 3 stars for effort and nothing else. Mai Xiang Yuan is the place to go in Montreal!!! Its the real McCoy.
Spice here was not for me, comes out of a jar. Korean beef was like eating an elastic. Dumplings were just OK and not with the $15 a pop. Double the price of china town. If the dumpling don't exploded in my mouth they are not the real deal and these lacked the explosion!!! 
Will I go back....only if I am near by and need a quick dumpling fix cause I am to lazy to drive down town."}
