{"text":"Do not eat here. My boyfriend and I ate here yesterday and both got food poisoning. I see we are not the only ones who have gotten sick. It's too bad. He loves sushi and can't even work today."}
{"text":"Pros: Friendly service, reasonable price, nice environment inside, local Oakville restaurant, typical sushi selection, Sushi quality OK.   Cons: Sashimi mediocre (red snapper quality was poor, salmon is OK - a bit soft). foood selection a bit small, nothing special.   Overall - not a bad place to go but don't expect anything out of the ordinary. Service is polite and food comes back, for AYCE it is reasonably priced. Not too many AYCE in the Oakville area and this is a nice compromise from driving to Scarborough."}
{"text":"Very friendly with great service and flavourful choices. For its price, all you can eat is generally the best option."}
{"text":"While visiting my grandfather in the hospital, my husband and I wanted to have sushi for dinner. Luckily Ami Sushi was closed, otherwise we would have never ended up at Yame Sushi. Try the grilled enoki mushroom with butter. It was so good!  Tempura was a bit oily, but still good.  Oh, and the chopped salmon sushi pizza was okay, but would have been better without the peppers."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for years and they have never disappointed, so I must give them a good review. Sushi and Sashimi is fresh, the same staff have been there for a while and know us as regulars which is nice. The portion sizes are good, and rarely have to wait for food to come out of the kitchen, good value for all you can eat"}
{"text":"Other than the seaweed, everything else was great. Friendly staff and fresh food. Their menue items are a  lot better than the ayce options but still one of the best ayce around . So maybe try them. PS  the ice cream is actually ice cream if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Service sucks! Grumpy Asians who don't really care! Son got food poisoning here! I'd pick zero stars I f I could!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner in a Saturday evening.  The menu is good. The service was decent (3/5). The food tasted great but no forethought about apps before mains, slow to refill water/ tea, etc... While there they had what appeared to be one large group of teens for a birthday. They had tables all across the venue and walked from one to the other. It was very noisy as well.   I would give it one more shot as the food was great but service and customer care need a little improvement."}
{"text":"Was highly recommended by a friend and I wasn't let down. Can easily compete with the better AYCE sushi joints in the city. Everything was great and tasted very fresh and not at all 'assembly line' like. The Sushi Pizza was especially great."}
{"text":"All you can eat lunch is good, you can try anything you want without limitations for a relatively good price for this type of lunch. Staff looks a bit tired and bored haha maybe because it is Saturday. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I read here, we were expecting something much better. The customer service is nonexistent, they just toss you plates and expect a tip. They kept on telling us we couldn't order anything else until we finished what was on the plate. At the end of our stay we decided that the service didn't warrant a tip,  to which the waitress pointed out that we hadn't. My boyfriend let them know that we were extremely dissatisfied with the service, to which the waitress said \"That's not an excuse!\". I wouldn't recommend coming here for anything besides a few rolls."}
{"text":"Located in Kerr village, this place is always busy! It's clean and friendly! They are careful with my dairy,nut and egg allergies! Thank you! My young is pleasantly on fire from the fresh wasabi!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place. Nice atmosphere. Delicious food. Friendly staff. And good price."}
{"text":"I frequent this place every time I'm in Oakville and never regret it. I recommend going on a weekday afternoon and doing all you can eat here. That is definitely when you will get the most value for your money.  My favourite things to order include: the deep fried maki rolls, the dragon maki rolls, the green curry chicken, and the udon. All are fantastic and have a really unique flavour to them. The service is also always friendly and quick. Your food will never take too long to arrive and it will always be hot and well made. Lastly, this place is also really good for accommodating large groups; my boyfriend and I often come here when his large group of friends (6-8 people) are having a get together."}
{"text":"All you can eat for $25 including tax.  Good job this is not in a better location otherwise there would be line ups."}
{"text":"Better than most ayce experiences. Service is a above average - not great but better than most ayce. The offerings a decent; the quality and craftsmanship is above average as well."}
{"text":"Previously I had not given this restaurant the best of reviews, but I have been to this restaurant three times is the last little while and honestly, it has improved SO MUCH.  On all three occasions we were greeted with a smile and seated right away. They still use the paper and pencil for their AYCE menu, but what's that saying, don't fix what isn't broken.   Their sashimi is SO FRESH! Honestly I can't get enough of their salmon and tuna sashimi. I have never really liked the tuna from anywhere else until I tried it at Yame.   Their spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls are awesome. They are my favourite!   Their beef ribs and tampura are great too. Love those little dumplings.  The only reason I didn't give it a five star rating is it seems to be a little inconsistent. Some nights the salmon sashimi is a nice cut, other times it's almost see through and hard to pick up.    My friends and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Frozen Beef Sashimi is the reason for this 3 star rating. Otherwise, the Sashimi was quite fresh. Service was attentative, but nothing on the menu stood out to me."}
{"text":"This place is reasonably priced and their sushi is delicious! I come here all the time and I'm never disappointed! The only thing I wish was better is the dessert menu, not a lot to choose from compared to other all you can eat sushi places I've been to. Still a great spot for a yummy lunch or dinner! The service is always great too!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the chicken Katsu is delicious! The sushi is awesome and it's always presented nicely. The service is great and it's all a good experience. We have been here lots of times and we love it!"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat sushi place in Oakville. Very reasonably priced. Service is good and variety of food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Feel the need to update this since I've been there a few times more and once for dinner.    Their sushi is better than most places in downtown Toronto (though it can't compare to Richmond Hill a LA carte), but I've ordered some additional things that make me think I should up my rating to 3.75 because they are total killers (in a good way)  a) Kalbi b) Moscow roll - OMG! Like move me to Russia!   Those two items are more than worth upping my rating to 3.75 forcing me to round up.    Need to re-visit again soon."}
{"text":"I had to write a new review because from a year ago the sushi quality has gone down a lot! Whoever owns this place is just making it so bad  all the sushi is now using fillers like tempura bits and other cheap crappy ingredients and the fish is no longer fresh, I ordered the salmon egg because it's my favorite and it came out so not fresh and so discussing looking the chef's or kids making the food should be ashamed of what they are putting out. Even the rice isn't made well ugh. Will never come here again. Shame."}
{"text":"I write this as I am trying to overcome the reprecussions of eating here last night.  My pants are so tight they're going to pop any second.  Why? Because YAME WAS AWESOME.  I went here last night with a group of about 12 people for a friend's birthday.  It was alot of fun.  They seated us in the middle of the dining room, so it wasn't really private. But they didn't really have any other place that a group so large could sit.  Fun bits:  1. The menu is your place mat. Feel free to dream about what to order next while you're eating.  2. They have a huge selection of special maki'z.   The food:  From what we ordered, which was basically everything, here are the things that stood out.   1. The Fire Kamakachi roll : Beautiful! Like a dragon roll with smoked salmon on top.  2. The Moscow Roll : So creamy and deep fried.  3. THE RIBS : OMG THE RIBS WERE FREAKING AMAZING. I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO EXPLAIN HOW AMAZING THEY WERE SO I'M USING CAPS.  4. The Beef Sashimi : My first time trying raw beef. It was soo good. Buttery and soft, and the dipping sauce was phenomenal! I ate it with everything. Especially went great with..  5. The Beef Rolls (Onion and Enoki) : They were soo good. The group wasn't too big of a fan of the onion compared to the enoki, but I say that's because they are wussies scared of onions. It was amazing.    The desert was standard fare : ice cream (Green Tea, Strawberry, Red Bean, Chocolate, Vanilla) They had mango on the menu, but they said it ran out. So I got a mix of strawberry and green tea. It was still awesome.     YAME ME BABY for the next time I go to oakville."}
{"text":"Such amazing tasting sushi.  Get the all you can eat and you can sample all of their different roles. The choices are so awesome. The coco roll, Moscow roll, Tropicana roll, fire kamikachi roll, spicy salmon roll, jungle roll.  The list is a bit crazy because it sounds like I'm just reciting the menu, but it's honestly because so much of what they serve is so good.  The bright green signage is a little off putting, but it's well worth it, and the interior is really nice. Great food, great price, and amazing value. Even for oakville!"}
{"text":"This Sushi restaurant has both all you can eat and a la carte. The food is pretty good. The service was better. We had different types of sushi rolls and some soups, a la carte. All of them were pretty good. Loved the udon noodle soup, as well as the Miso soup. The sushi pizza was also very good."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a year now and love it. The service is good and the staff is very friendly. They may just have ice-cream as dessert but their sushi rolls definitely make it up, especially my favourite-- Fire  Kamakachi Roll! :)"}
{"text":"Hmmm, yeah... sorry guys. I've had better.   I came here based on all the great reviews, even from some elites that I know and respect.   I was prepared for the service not being great from what I read (although it wasn't \"bad\"... it was really quite typical of a mid-range ayce sushi spot in the GTA) and willing to wait out the lunch crowd knowing that on the other side I'd get to maow down on some delicious maki.   Unfortunately, the offerings left a lot to be desired. Aside from the puney, unstuffed, loosely rolled maki being plated so lazily, that it didn't look appropriate to present, let alone eat, it was completely blah. Nothing special, dare I even say not very good. The nigiri wasn't any better. They get points for creativity in their menu but it's really a let down to actually see and eat their specialty rolls. I wound up getting a seaweed salad just to have something that had to be good and I couldn't bare more than two bites. It was bad.  Somehow this place seems to please most folks but it was a real let down for me. I don't think I'd come back even if invited. Sorry but that's my truth."}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars but 4 it is.  This place we popped in for lunch, I must say for the price you pay it was quite good! Service was kind, polite and fairly quick.   Good tasted good, and I really only had an issue with the decor of the inside a bit dated and could use some renovating. Overall a good experience. I haven't been for dinner but on a weekend lunch being ayce at 14.95 I have no complaints at all!"}
{"text":"YAME IS YAMMY :D  I'm always thrown off my the title \"as good as it gets\" when I rate a place 4 stars. I mean it's worthy, but it's probably NOT as good as it gets? Anyway, it is in my top 5 sushi places FO SHO! The only problem that it's way too far :(   Yame has a la carte and AYCE (I usually go for AYCE, duhh). $22 dinner weekdays and $23 dinner Fri to Sun. Lunch is $14 during the week and $15 Fri to Sun.  I came here a whole bunch of time, almost every single time I went to Oakville I ended up here. I could have easily rolled back to Toronto from the amounts I consumed...  Yame is small, with 5-6 booths and a couple more stand-alone tables. Everything always looks very clean, including the bathrooms, which are decked out in 20s looking wallpaper advertising underwear and baking soda instead of toothpaste :) so cute.   They have everything I want there - galbi, seaweed salad, amazingly fresh sashimi, specialty rolls, flying fish egg salad (try it!), tempura, etc etc.  From the specialty rolls the fire kamikachi and moscow rolls are my favorite. Moscow has a deep fries crispy shell on the outside and crab/cream cheese/other stuff I can't remember on the inside. Fire kamikachi is a little spicy with smoked salmon. All delicious stuff. I WANNA YAME IT ALL!!!  The staff are great - super friendly, helpful and quick. Orders usually start coming within 5 min and they don't make you fill out a sheet. They just take your order as you say it = much more convenient for you.   If you're in Oakville - Yame is definitely a hidden gem worth visiting!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: fresh food, big menu  Cons: not the friendliest service, not the tastiest place to get sushi in Oakville"}
{"text":"My partner and I love this place. The sushi is always fresh and delicious and, arguably, the best sushi place in Oakville. The staff is surprisingly fast for a sushi place and very friendly. Go here and you will not be disappointed. I would also suggest going for dinner because the extra price is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I tried this place when it first opened a few years ago, and I thought it was okay. Stopped by on Friday night and were pleasantly surprised. Food quality was good, place was extremely clean, and service was attentive and pleasant. Why not 5 stars? Some of the sashimi was cut a little too thick, not a big deal; however my personal hate is a tv in a restaurant. I will be back to this place, and if I am feeling bold I will tell them I deducted a star because of the TV"}
{"text":"We went for all you can eat, on a Monday evening. It was fairly empty. We put in our order and waited...and waited. It took 30 minutes for our first dish (tempura) to come out. Next to come out was the beef sashimi, which was literally frozen and had frost on it. The rest of the items slowly arrived, lacking quality and flavour. The only decent item was the tempura. I was really surprised, considering how well this place is rated.  Maybe I went on a bad night?"}
{"text":"Decent AYCE for the money! Loved ordering tempura by vegetable type - ie: I only want broccoli and sweet potato. Vegetable Udon soup was good; skewers were OK but I wish they had a kushiyaki other than chicken teriyaki."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious, definitely tasted like it was made to order!  The food took a little while to come, but that's considering it was a busy Friday night with what looked like only 3-4 staff working.  The staff didn't seem that interested in being there, and it didn't seem like they knew how to communicate well because anytime we asked for anything they just stared at us and walked away without acknowledgement of what we said.  Overall we went there for the food not the service, but I'm sure they were probably just tired and grumpy being short staffed on a Friday night."}
{"text":"We've been doing take out for a few months now, and sadly lately the quality seems to have gotten worse on the sushi and maki - it feels a lot more greasy and the fish has been tough and veiny. Hoping it'll turn back around because for a while we really liked this place! The value was great and the selection includes a lot of variety."}
{"text":"$15 and change per person before tips for ayce lunch. Pretty much all of their special rolls were delicious, and particularly the Moscow one I liked a lot.  Fire Kamakachi roll was a unique roll I have not seen elsewhere. The feature that stood out about it was the use of smoked salmon on the outside of the roll. The lunch menu didn't have soft shell crab roll, which is one of my personal favourites but that's ok, it's lunch.  Maybe the dinner menu might have it? Service was great, albeit, it wasn't very busy at 2pm on a Tuesday. My friend asked if they had chocolate ice cream even though it wasn't on the menu, and they did bring her some and added chocolate syrup upon request as well. Another thing I want to point out, a customer walked in for take out as they were closing and prepping for the dinner service and asked for a lunch special even though he had missed the lunch hours by quite a distance. But they still served him and gave him the deal. This to me says a lot about the integrity of the business. Would come again. =D"}
{"text":"Why is yelp awesome? Because when you visit an unfamiliar place and don't know where to go, Pick the place with the highest review and it will not dissapoint..This is usually the case, but definitely NOT for Yame Sushi.....  Visiting my friend all the way in the other end of town, she was craving sushi so of course I would use my handy-dandy yelp app to see where I can get the best sushi around the area. Maybe because there isn't too many selection for sushi in the area, Yame sushi popped up first on top of all its competitors so of course I picked it, no questions asked.   When I first walked into the restaurant, I felt very out of place  which NEVER happens because I'M ASIAN! The place was swamped with oakvillians so I was a little skeptical.... Not to bash on Oakvillians but I think us East side would be more familiar with the food.  I was not impressed with anything they served infront of me. The selections were VERY limited. By the second round of food, we didn't know what we wanted next because there wasn't much to choose from. They stuffed the rolls with rice to fill you up and the fish sashimi slices were thin as paper.   EEK. ME THINKS NOT."}
{"text":"I came here 10 times within a year. The all you can eat is the best thing! The sushi pizza was a huge disappointment though, but I'd still give out  5stars."}
{"text":"The inside of the restaurant looks better than the outside. It actually looks bigger. For a Japanese place, it wasn't very bright (the lighting).   The had an a-y-c-e menu, but we decided to go for a la carte.   They had many selection of food that it was hard to decide what to eat. I ordered a bento box with asparagus beef roll which was cooked nicely. I would have preferred a bit more. The steam rice was small. The 2 veggie dumplings had a nice crunch to it. It came with 6 Cali rolls which was a good size but the avocado was browning already. Definitely not fresh.  Earlier on, I had the miso soup which was not salty. The salad was drenched in the sauce with little lettuce.   My partner had the spider roll which was decent.   The one washroom was unisex and the decor felt like it was not changed from the previous owner. Nothing Japanese about it.    The servers' English weren't the greatest so you had to pay attention to what they said.   Verdict: It was alright, but I will only go back if I'm in that area in Oakville. There was a KerrFest happening nearby too! A community event. But perhaps, I'll try another local restaurant there."}
{"text":"There are definitely some dishes that could be improved- like the beef teriyaki - but when it comes to maki rolls Yame can't be beat. The selection of rolls is endless- I would strongly recommend the Moscow Roll, the Sunshine Roll, and the Fire Kamacachi Roll.     If you go for a little early for your lunch or dinner you will be able to select your seats but it does get quite busy during peak times.  Service has always been quick until you want the bill- sometimes you are required to go up to the cash to pay.  Prices are fair and the food is good- definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants we could find open for delivery during the ice storm. Our food was said to arrive within 45 minutes, I mentioned to my boyfriend I doubted that, 20 minutes top. Sure enough our food was here within 20 minutes. Soup still hot, fresh delicious ingredients. I have been ordering and dining in here for years and have never had a poor experience."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but the quality of food has gone down over the years. They are a small family owned business I assume as it's always been the same people. Not as fancy as some of the newer Japanese places these days but they have quite a few menu items that others don't. My favorite thing here is the grilled salmon belly. No other place can ever compare, trust me I've tried. Also I love their fire kamicachi roll. (not sure if I spelled that correctly)"}
{"text":"Great service! Every time I go I'm always greeted with a smile and the food is absolutely delicious!! Would come here all the time"}
{"text":"I just dropped by here for lunch about 1.5 hour ago and I am disappointed after reading the 2 good reviews for Yame Sushi.  Me and my friend got there at 12:15 pm and it took about 15 minutes for the server to approach us and get our order. I ordered the lunch bento box that came with 3 cali rolls, 3 salmon rolls, salad, and chicken teriyaki. The food took a very long time to arrive...approximately 20 minutes.   The salad that came with my bento box was heavily drenched in dressing...the salad was basically drowning. Also, the chicken had way too much teriyaki sauce on it. The chicken didn't have any flavour at all so obviously it wasn't good. The only decent thing out of my bento box was the sushi. My friend wanted to go for a round 2 but the servers took a very long time to come get his order and when he did place his order the food took more than 20 minutes to arrive. By then we decided to leave.  It took about 15-20 minutes to drive here and I will never return to Yame Sushi for the second time. The service was terrible and my bento box was disappointing. Next time I'll just stay in Mississauga if I want sushi."}
