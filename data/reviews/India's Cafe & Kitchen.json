{"text":"This is as authentic as INDIAN food gets. We loved the food here when we merely stopped by on our road trip to east coast from the mid-west...this place is a TRUE gem..I was taken off guard a little by the presentation of the place, the plastic silverware were awkward..but the FOOD made it all WORTH it!! In fact, now on my every road trip..I stop by here and have my meal..the best meal I get during my whole road trip is right here..the elderly owners are amazing..they are such wonderful couple and make the BEST INDIAN food there is..over all, I have not been to a restaurant like this in US..this is what real Indian food tastes like..so go for it!! Not that expensive and VERY VERY delicious..what they say is true..never judge a book by its cover..what an example!!"}
{"text":"Great food and a good price for the amount given. This was my first time having Indian food so decided to go simple with the butter chicken. Ordered it with mild seasoning and it was just right.

Would recommend giving them a try if you happen to be in the area. I'll be back possibly again this weekend."}
{"text":"India's Cafe & Kitchen is appropriately named.  The restaurant doesn't have much seating, but its kitchen is huge and supports an active take out and catering service.

The restaurant also doesn't waste effort on pretense.  In fact, it gets negative pretense points because the silverware is plastic, and the food is served on disposable plates.  Instead, the kitchen produces food that tastes great.  I'm by no means an Indian food aficionado, but I've always enjoyed the dishes at this restaurant and consistently drive from Cleveland Heights to eat here.

The weekend lunch buffets are not bad but leave something to be desired.  The selection is not extensive - a couple of vegetarian and a couple of meat dishes.  Customer volume is low, so the pakora can get soggy.  For lunch buffet I might recommend India Garden in Rocky River.

I like to patronize this restaurant for its good food and very nice and down to earth owner.  Pass on the buffet and order fresh.  Highly recommended Indian food for dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Very good tasting food.
This place is an example of \"hole in the wall\" type of restaurants, which generally serve great tasting authentic ethnic foods.
Ignore the shoddy tables, plastic cutlery and foam plates. Instead, focus on the food and service/hospitality.
The owner manages the front and his wife and few employees manage the kitchen. He has always been friendly and welcoming. His manner of treating guests is very casual but genuine and homely.
Food has always been good. From portions to flavors to prices.
Order off the menu - because of not enough traffic, buffet may not always be up to the mark.  We have had various curries, chaats and Samosa.  Everything was spot on.  Their pani-puri is very very good. The pani tastes pretty close to what I remember from india.
As someone else pointed out in review, their main business is take out and catering. So don't go there expecting Michelin star table service and ambience. The tiny place is good enough for those who want good food and don't mind simplicity."}
{"text":"I came here about a month ago because  I have passed this place for 2 years and finally decided to try it. I was told they did not have any chicken, the lady behind the counter was not very helpful and there was a man who worked there awkwardly lying on a couch in the restaurant. I told myself then that I would probably not be back. I gave in a few weeks later because I was craving good Indian food. The same unfriendly women took my order. I got the order to-go and was severely disappointed. The naan was cold and so hard that I couldn't even break off bits of the naan. The tiki masala and rice were sub-par. I certainly won't be back to this place and waste more money for over-priced bad food."}
{"text":"I took a chance -- I walked in, and immediately was unimpressed by the presentation and layout... the place is small, looks dirty, the utensils, water pitchers, dishware, are all plastic or disposable... the chairs and tables were really cheap looking.  I started to get scared that I'd made a horrible mistake... I sat there, nervously and awkwardly with my boyfriend...

A very friendly Indian gentleman took our order, and seemed a bit surprised that we were requesting a level of spicyness that I guess doesn't sit well with most vanilla folks who inhabit Parma.  He fulfilled our request though, and left us happy with gentle embers in our mouth.

The food was absolutely delicious.  I loved it, and I want to go again and give them my business!  In fact, it was the first time I really enjoyed Indian food, and it prompted me to explore more in this wonderful cuisine!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this based on a friend's suggestion. I had eaten here years before and it was good. 

I ordered take out on a Sunday evening. The menu had a few different vegetarian options. I ordered the Mixed Vegetables Jalfrazi. My order was taken and presented in about 20 minutes. Not bad. 

The reason I give this place a two is because of the portion size, it was much smaller than most other Indian restaurants and the lack of vegetables in my mixed vegetables. I was expecting a variety of vegetables and it was mostly onions and carrots. The flavor was good but I left wanting more. Y'know that feeling, when you get your hopes up about a really good meal? I had that. Then I was let down."}
{"text":"Love it! Currylicious! Nothing bad to say about this place very authentic great spot for Indian fix"}
{"text":"Great authentic Indian food! I definitely recommend the buffet, you get a great selection of dishes, great idea for people wanting to try Indian cuisine for the first time.  Service has always been friendly and for the quality, I think the prices are fair."}
{"text":"My boys and I eat dinner there this evening. I must say the food was delish. I will be going back soon"}
{"text":"$5.99 vegetarian platter for lunch(Tues-Thurs) is a great deal and delicious!
Dal, mixed veg, rice, naan, dessert 
I've had the buffet here in the past and loved it enough to come back."}
{"text":"Bad service, not clean, misleading and misunderstandings due to language barriers. A lot of conditions on paying. Food was too spicy, the rice pudding and butter chicken with rice were the two ok things. Buffet is $10 a person. Brought a friend had a voucher which does not state cannot be used at lunch so very confusing as other vouchers do. Not a modern atmosphere I prefer but they tried their best with keeping clean at least the food presentation area. I will give someone else the voucher with details, my friend and I do not intend to revisit."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find and isn't in a really great looking area but if you're looking for some home cooked North Indian food it's a good place to go. The owner is a friendly older gentleman and will be happy to customize your order. He usually has some extra dessert snacks to sell if you want something to take home. The place is kind of small so I wouldn't recommend a large party, but it's not bad for a few people or to go with your significant other. I'd recommend the navratan korma, it's very creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"Second time we've eaten here; first was dine in.  Don't judge them on the decor or the disposable dinnerware.  The food on the saturday afternoon buffet was absolutely delicious.  It prompted our return two weeks later for take-out.  Again, absolutely delicious.  The gentleman that helped us both times (I'm pretty sure it's the owner) couldn't have been more kind and informative, and that really adds to an experience for me."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  Loved their Samosas and Khasta Kachories with Cilantro and Tamrind Dips, Onion and Sev.  They make good jain food if you order it in advance.  The owners Rubiji and her spouse are very sweet people.  Mainly caters their food.  Smaller set up on the Ridge road, Parma; however, food is awesome! Their Aloo Gobhi and Palak paneer must try.

{"text":"I came to India's Cafe and Kitchen for lunch recently. It took about 15 minutes to get there from Rockside Road in Independence. If you are pressed for time on a lunch hour, it may be to your advantage to call ahead and place the order. The very kind gentleman working advised that some of the menu offerings would take slightly longer to prepare than others. The interior is a basic, no frills restaurant; my favorite kind of place. Many of the negatives that other reviewers complain about are in the plus column for me. The vegetarian dishes were both decent. The food was not very spicy which bummed me out a little bit."}
{"text":"I'll admit, I didn't order from India Cafe and Kitchen, but I'm glad someone else did!

Everything was delicious and my table of  Indians were all very pleased with the selection.  Everything was hot and they presented things very nicely.

There was a selection of chicken tika, a delicious paneer dish and much more (also, I was on the side without the labels, so I'm going by memory).  

The cucumber \"salad\" was a perfect mix for everything to cool things off a bit.

Finishing things up with galar halwa (carrot desert) and gulab jamun (sugar balls) - everything was delicious!!!

It's nice to have some spicy selections that actually taste of India instead of the Americanized version that you run across more often than not.  Next time I'm ordering Indian catering, I'm ordering from here!"}
