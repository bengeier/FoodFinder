{"text":"Came here yesterday afternoon for some pho. As you walk in, there is a strong scent of incense (which I wasn't a fan of). However, there is a wall that separates the dining room from that area so it didn't create a problem. We were seated by what looked like the owner-super friendly. We ordered the typical pho with rare beef in it and it was fantastic! Definitely one of the top pho restaurants I've been to...and I've been to ALOT! They also have bubble tea on their menu here..wanted to order it but was way too full already!  The only downside: the water was green inside the fish tank :/ unfortunately I had to stare at it the entire time I was eating my food. Regardless, I will go back when I am back in town!"}
{"text":"This extension of the Superior Ave original is not as good in any sense of the word. The food didn't taste as fresh and the decor is a bit more strip mall.     Their sign said they are open 5-11 pm.  It looks like they are closed Sunday."}
{"text":"The beef noodle pho was good, and there was adequate srichacha available to supplement the thimbleful provided upon request.  The fresh rolls contained turkey as well as shrimp, an interesting combo that somehow seemed to work.  The taro boba arrived in a parfait glass and looked beautiful, but I almost broke a tooth on the first bubble of hardened tapioca, and the taro seemed sweeter than it needed to be.  How is hardened tapioca possible?  I'll return when I solve the mystery."}
{"text":"Just wanted to let everyone know that unfortunately this location has closed for good. We tried to order takeout the other day and the only person there was the new owner. He told us to stop by in a month or so, he plans to open a new thai restaurant."}
{"text":"The broth was kind of weak on Saturday when I got pho, They gave us extra basil and the service was great. The basil was very fresh but the bean sprouts were not. I enjoyed the leftover pho for dinner more than the hot pho so it wasn't too bad but not the best I've had. The rice paper rolls were good though."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Pho and spring rolls. Because I can't help it, I can only compare them to my beloved Saigon, and thinking of it that way, I can only give 3 stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho! I had the vegetable pho in the vegetable broth, and everything was fresh and fabulous. It really is #1.  Don't miss the vegetable spring rolls."}
{"text":"This place had super delicious Pho but the decor left me with an empty feeling in my soul.  But seriously, beef pho, spring rolls and some crazy Vietnamese cold salad with noodles we had were all fantastic. You will not be disappointed!"}
