{"text":"This kim po vietnamese restaurant opened up not too long ago, so I decided to finally give it a try. I don't know what this location used to be, but it seems Kim po has rennovated pretty much everything. All the furniture and decor look brand new. I needed a change from eating pho so much so I ordered the special Fuk-Kien noodle soup large. It was GOOD! I would highly recommend this to anyone.  Great vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"HUGE portions, delicious and attractive recipes, refreshing drinks, friendly staff, and a clean and pleasant interior. The Mr. Pho is a great quality pho restaurant for VERY cheap prices. Eat like a king, pay like a pauper. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great \"Vietnamese\" foods overall, especially the lemongrass chicken with rice and fried egg.   Not Recommended: the curry chicken with rice. In our table of 5, 2 ordered this main and it turned out very murky and questionable. The taste was overwhelming with coconut and nothing that resembles \"curry\".   Great and clean decor.  Professional and friendly servers."}
{"text":"New Management.  New Name.  It's now Mr. Pho."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place was able to give us our orders within 3 minutes of ordering but I think the Flash is working in their kitchen. Either that or every soup dish just comes out of one big pot and they just charge different prices to screw with you.   Either way the portions were hefty - I ordered a small but it came out the equivalent of a large for under $6 while the hubs ordered the large and it came out the size of a swimming pool. We put the kid in it and let him drink his way to freedom.  Overall it was quick and tasty. Bonus points for having clean high hairs on hand where the belt actually worked too!"}
