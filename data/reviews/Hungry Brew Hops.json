{"text":"Great spot for drinks and food. My only hesitation is that this place is way too small to accommodate the weekend crowd."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant in the area. Their food is incredible. Their chef is extremely talented and pays attention to food trends and fresh ingredients. Their beer and wine selection is unrivaled, and their cocktails are delicious. I couldn't recommend this restaurant enough. I think some people would be a little overwhelmed by all of the different ingredients, and it may be out of the comfort zone of a pizza and burgers type person, but for that type, their HBH burger is the best burger I've ever had, and their woodsy pizza is to die for. There is something for everyone here. I moved recently and am now an hour away... this was the worst part about moving!!! Even so, I've already been there since I moved, and will still regularly make the drive. If you haven't been here - You HAVE to go."}
{"text":"Alright. To start off, this is a great place to come for drinks. With 30 on tap beers and 3-4 on tap wines plus a well stocked bar, it appeases many pallets. I've been here late nights for a drink, but this time I was sad there was only one cider on tap, so I opted for the Pinot Grigio.  5/5 stars for the bar scene.

Food. Ahh this is where they lose me. My mom and I went out together, she got the pork belly tacos, I got the Pablo pizza and we shared fries. The tacos looked great, until we poked them around... 

One entire piece of pork belly was pure fat, zero meat. And I'm not talking bacon fat, I'm talking like.. a full cm thick, 3 inches long hunk of fat. It was disgusting. The presentation was nice and we were curious why they gave two extra tortillas. Then my mom tried to wrap the tortilla with everything already on it, and it exploded from sogginess. My recommendation, deconstruct and let the customer build their own. 

My pizza was alright. I've had much better for the price I paid. First, there was no mention of breaded chicken on the menu, but the Pablo came with breaded chicken, it honestly tasted like a frozen chicken finger. The crust was dense and chewy, and there wasn't as much blue cheese as I'd like. But there was lots of mozzarella and bacon and the chicken, even though I didn't care for it much. 

Thank god we got the fries. I've never left so much food behind due to the fact that I didn't like it! The sauces for the fries were awesome! The fries were crunchy yet soft inside, and seasoned really well!

Wh this place didn't completely fall in the star rating was due to the awesome bar scene and that our waitress was really friendly."}
{"text":"I rocked the pork belly tacos...great choice, the jalapeños gave it some real heat, good thing I had a wide selection of quality beers to choose from to deal with that heat. Speaking of heat, glad to see they now have Old Flame on Tap, having a Dirty Blonde to finish my meal. The wife approves...

Also tried the fried chicken, solid, real solid!"}
{"text":"Great place! The food was excellent and the beer was fantastic. Great selection of beer to try. All around fantastic dining experience."}
{"text":"First off. I absolutely love the vibe of this place. The clientele range from 19 to 70. And everyone is making noise. Not a bad thing. Just seems to have a controlled raucousness to it. And the decor is really cool.

The beer menu is massive. I found they, like everyone these days, are veering towards the extra hoppy brews for the most part. Unfortunately for palates like mine, that just means bitter beer. I was still able to find a few to my liking, but be aware.

Now the menu. Have only tried a few things. Well, there are only a few things on it.
The wings are ok. Good flavour. But they are small. And pricey. I actually enjoyed the shrimp chips that come with them more. Probably would not get again. I ordered the banh mi sandwich with fries. The fries were very good. Hand cut. As for the sandwich, the flavour was good. There was a very thin slice of pork belly on a large bun, with a nice sauce. It was an awful lot of bun with very little of substance inside. Will definitely never order again. A waste of $14. My wife ordered the grilled chicken grilled cheese with fries. She won dinner. It was great. Tons of chicken and cheese. It was delicious. And cheaper than the banh mi. I was jealous.

So I guess we'll have to give this another go. I'm worried we're going end up ordering the grilled cheese every time though.

It's a great place to grab some craft beers and hang out though."}
{"text":"Decent service and the nachos are great! Well... most of the time lol I've had their nachos 3+ times and 2 times they were fantastic and had enough toppings, other times there was t enough toppings.  
Love their wine on tap, great idea :) 

Not a huge menus or a lot to it."}
{"text":"If you're new to Newmarket, you'll fall in love with this place. It's our new watering hole when we move up here next year. We brought up some friends to check out this gem. There's no reservation unless over 7 people

They didn't have the beer braised beef short ribs (as seen in another post) but the beef checks won't disappoint. The Braised Beef cheeks ($24) were cooked to perfection served on slices of butternut squash and sweet potatoes with a savoury sauce. It's so rich that it should be served on a bed of risotto or brown rice.  This one is definitely a new favs. I'll be ordering this again. 

The 3 pork belly tacos ($14) were perfect with a side of bacon topped roasted Brussels sprouts ($5). Alone it might be on the small-size. One more would have been good.  The sprouts were seasoned well with caramelized shallots and sherry vinaigrette - roasted to perfection. 

Kids pizza was a 12\" three-cheese pizza. It was really good cheese pizza!  It came with a choice of milk, soda or juice (including one refill!). Pomegranate ginger ale...yum...my new favourite non-alcoholic drink

We had the 4x 4oz sampler beers ($10). It's a good idea to buy since there were 33 types of drinks on tap tonight. Pom (apple flavoured) and Fruitesse (fruit punch flavoured) we're good for a light-weight drinker like me. The House beer was my hubby's favourite. The Chouffle was not bad either for a blonde ale. 

Great selection of beer, very good food and definitely a place to come back to eat with friends and family."}
{"text":"Lots of varieties of beer and excellent choices.  Food was ok, nothing special just standard bar food.  Would be back anytime for drinks."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great staff. I've dined here in small groups and had my rehearsal dinner here and it's always a great visit!"}
{"text":"Hungry brew hops has been a staple in our restaurant routine but as of lately the wait staff isn't as friendly and the food is getting tired....I recently had the burger because the staff insisted it was the best in Newmarket (assuming because a new burger bar opened around the corner) and it was dry and very overrated. When we mentioned a new burger place around the corner to our waitress She went on about the \"horrible\" things she's heard about them. It seems like they were trying to throw shade on the other places nearby, which just made me uncomfortable. We should all be supportive of one another as local businesses in a small town like Newmarket! That's not to say I won't be back because it is a great spot with decent food but I just got bad vibes and bad food the last few times we were in."}
{"text":"Probably not the greatest place for groups of 10 or more. I went with about 12 other people and had booked a reservation, and it seemed that they had a hard time accommodating us. We got a table after our reservation time, and it did not seat all of the people we had, so we all rotated standing. Standing in this bar is a little tough though as it is quite busy and there isn't really any designated standing room. Aside from that, the servers were very knowledgeable. The one server our table had seemed kind of annoyed that she had to deal with so many people, but I imagine that she doesn't represent the norm.

I had poutine with my flight of beer, and although it tasted good, there were no cheese curds! Just shredded cheese. I found this disappointing.

The crowd was great and full of people in their mid twenties to what seemed to be forties. Everyone was having a good time. 

They have TONS of bars on tap, and that's great for both beer connoisseurs as well as people new to beer."}
{"text":"Wanted to step away from your regular chain restaurants for a date night and this place did not disappoint! Great drink menu, lots of craft beer on tap which I was happy to see. We started with apps, jalapeño corn bread and beer battered spicy cauliflower, delicious! My boyfriend got the schnitzel and I got the short ribs and both of these mains were scrumptious! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great choice of beers and very knowledgeable, friendly staff--the friends I went with aren't really beer drinkers, and our server was able to direct all of us to drinks that made us happy.  Stocking the bottle list with fruit beers was definitely a good call!  The place is beautiful, with tin ceiling tiles and Edison bulbs, and it's fun to watch the action in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Very talented chef. Great service and atmosphere. 
We were in Newmarket for only 18 hours, had an amazing dinner (steak fries and stronger bass, both stunning) and came back for lunch. 
You can't go wrong when you eat (and drink) here."}
{"text":"Beer is good food is good.  Service is terrible unless you get one of the men bartenders serving you. They are really helpful,  otherwise whole place is full of bimbos who dont give two cares about being at work that includes managers and hostess."}
{"text":"A hidden Gem in Newmarket and also discovered the municipality's gorgeous main street! If you are looking for a Gastropub away from Downtown, I highly recommend trying this place out.

We went on Sunday for lunch, place was not too busy. The interior wowed me the moment I stepped in as I was not expecting to find something like this in York Region. Service was excellent, from the hostess to the server.

There are 27 beers to choose from and I recommend getting the beer flight ($10) so you can try out four different types of beer. The portions are pretty generous as well. There was a lunch special offered and we decided to share the roasted beer sandwich with potato chips ($10). There were four other options available ranging from $9-$12 which is pretty decent price in my opinion. The beef was very tender and we added mustard which definitely brought out the flavour. I would the only improvement to that is to make the beef a bit juicier. 

Very tempted to go back to try their dinner menu options, especially with the photos that other Yelpers have posted!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to go with my friends, great food, fantastic beer selection and perfect location.
There's great access to parking in the lot behind so that's never a problem, the decor is great and the service is pretty great.
 
Now for the important stuff: the food is fantastic, great tasty food that you don't normally find in Newmarket and when they say it's spicy, it's actually spicy, not Canadian mild. There's a constantly changing beer selection depending on what's available seasonally which makes it exciting to go every couple of weeks to check out the new stuff. 

It can be a little pricey but it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great food. Good beer selection. Solid atmosphere.

It's a little expensive, but my only real complaint is that too many hipsters frequent the place!

4/5*"}

{"text":"Nice joint. Very good beer selection. 
I am from MI, visiting on holidays and quite beer spoiled 
Boris the owner was knowledgeable and was happy to cook a burger to order rather than to death. What a welcome change. 
Great service, attentive bartender. 

Five stars for a reason. Go before everyone else does 

Cheers, Boris. See you in my town this fall!

{"text":"Just had lunch here. Both the pork belly banh ma and the HBH burger were absolutely delicious. Good selection of craft beer. The house lager was light and refreshing. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thought the place would be packed on a Friday night so we decided on an early dinner time. Started with the bone marrow and the brussels sprouts. Both are AAA+++. They also had 33 beers on tap at the time. For our main course, I had the beer braised short ribs. Lots of flavour and the meat were just falling off the bone. Wife had the margarita pizza which was just average. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers, food needs a little work, wings are bland but nicely cooked, much better than deep fried. Bone marrow was bland and pizza was so-so, dough seemed store bought, very dry. Hamburger was excellent though. Staff is friendly and courteous. If you are sitting at bar, bring a cushion, barstools are uncomfortable...it's still early days, have high hopes and high expectations."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal at Hungry Brew Hops. Food and drink have always been great. The only drawback that I find is that if you don't get here before dinner hour, then you're going to have a really long wait for a table. Also, they don't take reservations for less than 6 people which can be a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"Great place, love the variety. Wished it was open earlier. Food will evolve.

Need to try every beer eventually.

Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Finally a good place to eat in Newmarket.  Great atmosphere, great beers and great menu.  Highly recommend.  Can be busy... and can be loud."}
{"text":"Did a flight of the House lager-clean and refreshing.
Rain heart Imperial Stout-coffee and Carmel.
Stone hammer oatmeal coffee Stout-soft coffee notes
Ohara's Stout-very light for a stout"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, drinks & great food. It's a popular place so before you go in you should obviously know there's going to be a bit of a wait."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious. Tried a few different sandwiches, did not disappoint. The beer selection are plenty.  This is definitely a place to keep going back to."}
{"text":"Very unique restaurant offering not only an amazing beer line up with 26 on tap (I'm told that's the most north of the 401hwy) and even more by the bottle, but continues to amaze with a delicious menu that has been crafted by a culinary master. 

I had an opportunity to meet Chef Boris long before they opened and got very excited about his concept for a Gastropub and I am thrilled to see it come to fruition. Now if you're not into beer, they still have plenty of other cocktails to choose from, but I would recommend adventuring into their beer list with some help from the staff. They are fantastic at dealing in on your taste buds. 
With what feels like limited seating because of how many people are eating, this place gets very busy for dinner so I recommend either going early or going late. The traditional times for dinner (not yet open for lunch) can mean long wait times if you don't have reservations. 
The food is amazing. I've already been 5 times and tried something different each time. Hard to say what's best but the burger and short ribs are very \"memorable\". They also have vegetarian options if you prefer a meat free experience. 
Also, they have a fantastic public space upstairs as well as a meeting room for hosting a meeting which has flat screen TVs for your presentation needs. 
My fav beer so far is the \"Ommegang\"
Trey it out. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Nice place located right on the main strip.  Good atmosphere and food.
Burgers are great.  Prices a bit high for my taste.
Lots of parking behind, note on the strip."}
{"text":"One of the more trendier places in Newmarket...started a nice trend along Main street. Provides a younger, fun atmosphere that isn't junk or a wing joint. Food was delicious and being a huge beer fantastic is was awesome having so many options to pick from."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Newmarket in about a lifetime and was here with a couple of girlfriends. One has been before and the other was a noob just like myself. 

I wasn't too hungry but I could still eat something and their lunch menu caught my eye. Specifically their grilled cheese sandwich. I won't lie, the price was the most attractive thing about the lunch menu so I opted for their grilled cheese. 

Caul Me Cheesy - Wasn't your average grilled cheese either; it was one that was actually stuff with some cheesy cauliflower. The bread was some kind of white bread which was nicely buttered - not too much, not too little. However, being someone who makes grilled cheese/Monte cristos often, I like to have the grill marks all throughout, and all the way to the edges. But, it wasn't a big a deal. The cauliflower was perfectly roasted and had the right amount of cheese. As you bite into it, you almost get that \"meat like\" texture, which was very nice. I think Jane Villanueva would be quite happy with it. 5/5.

Curry Chicken Soup - Had a small bowl on the side to go with my grilled cheese and it was actually a nice compliment. Soup was hearty and very flavourful. Even though I accidentally ate the fresh cilantro (eww!) in the first bite, it was still nice. Was even nicer when I picked out the evil weed. Wish it had a little bit more chicken but I guess the amount was acceptable considering it was a small bowl. 4/5 (-1 for the evil weed). 

Hand-cut Fries - I shouldn't even be eating fries but I couldn't resist after seeing my friend's order. In my personal opinion, if a restaurant is going to serve fries, they should all be hand-cut fries. None of this, steak fries or what have you that tastes and looks like they just ripped open a bag from M&M Meat Shops or McCain. Anyway, fries were bomb.com and is a must-have. It's the perfect fries for Poutine. 5/5.

Steak Tacos - I had just a bite of my friend's Taco and because she doesn't have taste buds, it was boring as hell. Boring as in, no hot sauce or anything. Regardless, the tacos were good. Thankfully I notice the evil weed so I avoided that part. I'm sure that would've added more flavor but I just don't like cilantro. I'd rather put some hot sauce and/or guacamole and sour cream. Could've used a little more seasoning and maybe not cooked as much either as I found it a little bit dry. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Service was very slow food was not amazing 

We did not get the beers that we ordered until after we already ate most of our food! When we asked where the drinks were they said please wait we are busy and under staffed then rudely walked away. Although I understand that things happen don't make excuses solve problems"}
{"text":"yeah, this place is the best. Exactly what Main Street Newmarket needs and boosts up the overall appeal of Main Street Newmarket, attracting more cool businesses and clientele into the neighbourhood. Great selection of beers, wine on tap (could have better selection with the wine), but overall, I will remain a regular guest."}
{"text":"I have now been here a couple of times and the food is absolutely outstanding. The beer selection is also fantastic. The service staff have been really good but prepare for a bit of a wait if you go just about any weekend evening. If you are in no hurry, it is well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Went out for an unplanned dinner with no reservation and they took great care to find us a table with the most amazing server 

Started dinner with the bone marrow and I could have had another few orders and had just that.  Picked red onions to cut some of the richness was perfect. 

Gluten /dairy free squash soup was another hit. 

We ordered beef cheeks, friend chicken, smoked salmon pizza, steak Frits and a burger. 

I would rank the dishes in that order starting with really good to just ok. 

This place has s great vibe and energy. Definitely would go back"}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised that Newmarket had such a hip spot for draft beers and gourmet pub food like you would find in Queen West!!  My friends took us here (knowing that we love this kind of food), and it was a hit!  It was Beau's night, so they had over 20 different Beau's beers on tap.  We ordered mussels, duck pizza, Brussels sprouts, Scottish egg thing and corn bread and they were all super yummy!!  A tad on the greasy side - but HEY, that just makes the beer go down easier!  Ha!  Service was very friendly - and our waitress made great recommendations and was very patient with our indecisiveness on beer selection.  And I just loved the rustic, chalk board decor.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing, all I can say is definitely get the bone marrow, tuna sashimi, steak frites, pork belly tacos, brownie, and cheesecake desert. This is by far the best bar/appetizer place you can go to in Newmarket"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!!!! A Gastropub worthy of my Beer snobbery!

For too long we've been outcasts to the Craft brewery purveyors up here in York region. That's all changed. With a wife and kids it not easy to get downtown to enjoy this kind of an establishment. Who am I kidding.... It's impossible. This is the place.... Finally we have what Newmarket/Aurora/Richmond Hill has yearned for a very long time. First off.... The beer.... Divine (both in selection and quality). The food? Delicious and matched well with the drink. The decor and ambiance.  Chillycool.... Wood, glass and steel. All put together in a very inviting and warm way. 

James and the staff are amazing, friendly and accommodating. We dropped in last weekend and I asked him what good IPA's do you have? James replied \"what IBU's are you looking for?\" I think I might've cried a bit from the sheer joy I felt at that moment. I knew I had finally found my spot.

My wife enjoyed the gourmet grilled cheese sandwich with melted Brie. My kids loved the pizza (yep... they have a kids menu) and I loved the popcorn with Grenache cheese and pancetta paired well with my GLB tank ten IPA's which got tastier with each pour. Finally? The Beer. Every single staff member there knows good beer. 

Last words. Arrive early. This is a cozy spot so it gets busy by 6. Packed by 7. Rammed by 8 Fridays and Saturdays. Yes, I did say earlier I brought my kids however that was a Sunday afternoon. I wouldn't recommend trying family night there on a Friday or Saturday night! It's definitely more for the 30 something's and up. 

Enjoy! You'll definitely see me there from now! By the way.... Did I mention the beer? ;)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"After many visits for one reason or another, I can finally put my touch on one of my favourite restaurants in the GTA, and in my opinion one of the best in Newmarket!

It's located on the rapidly changing Newmarket Main St, in what was once an original bank. To enter HBH, you'll be blown away by the decor first of all, reclaimed wood industrial feel, meets vintage fixtures, meets micro craft beer and gastropub style eats.

My most recent visit, I wasn't anticipating to stop and eat, but then I started looking at the menu, I had a pint of Great Lakes Breweries Canuck Pale Ale, and before I knew it - screw it, I'm eating here!

I went with the well photographed and often enjoyed Bone Barrow appetizer to start. Kind of a gross thing when you think about it too hard --so don't... just eat it! A beef bone sawed in half, lightly seasoned and cooked in the oven. Served on a wood baord with some pickled onions, lemon and crustini bread. You basically scoop the marrow out, spread it on the bread and enjoy - and you will because this is every foodies dream and every vegan/vegetarians worst nightmare so be sure you're in the right company if you order this one up.

For my main I went with the Shrimp po-boy sandwich. On taste and presentation this was a winner. A sure fire winner, jerk seasoned jump prawns in a Italian style bun, topped with pineapple chunks served with a side of homemade potato chips. Incredible. My only grief was the size, even after the bone marrow app and eat the sandwich and all the chips I was still hungry. Lesson learned if you've got a huge hunger on this might not be the best option for you - go for the HBH burger instead - now that's a meal. That said, if you love a good po-boy and don't eat like the pig that I am than this sandwich will suit you just right.

Lastly... the beer - this place doesn't stock any beer that isn't from a micro brewery and they come from all over the world and they're always changing so be sure you're checking back in regularly because you never know what you're going to get

{"text":"SURE-FIRE: pickled jalapeños, shredded lettuce, spicy beer onions, pepper jack cheese, maple sriracha, pure beef patty cooked to order on a brioche bun.  

The burger: 9/10

It has been a few weeks since I had a burger that made me go wow - amazing job HBH. This made the grade!  Amazing flavour, a moist juicy beef patty, and a nice spicy bite from the pickled jalapeño.

HBH doesn't just stop with great food but also offers the areas widest selection of beer on tap offering a draught selection of 37 taps and features only the finest microbrews and wines (yes, they have wine on tap!), highlighted by ipa's, lagers and stouts from both local and abroad. Add to this a menus of canned and bottled beverages and you are in for a treat no matter your fancy.  

For me, I need to give the West Avenue barrel aged Cider a try - the Catalyst Mark III at $27 a can (750ml) - will make for a nice treat while people watching on their sidewalk patio.  However, for today, a refreshing can of Newmarket's own Ernest."}
{"text":"Great first impression. Ordered a sampler of beers which was chosen from an extensive choice of brews and a cheese platter. Was quite impressed with both.
Also had the house soup for a starter which was potato bacon which was bland and tasteless.
Mains were Mac and cheese, bone marrow, grilled cheese, fried and gravy. 
Mac and cheese: bland, tasteless and dry.
Bone marrow: quite unique, very tasty but a little oily 
Fries and gravy: fresh cut, crispy and amazing!
Grilled cheese: (this is where it took a turn for the worse) it came with chicken, onions and spinich. When we pointed out to our server that we wanted a plain grilled cheese with bacon she was quick to correct this and said it was available from the kids menu. Fine. The new Sandwhich was brought out quickly and was great. 
The bill came and we noticed we were charged for the chicken grilled cheese and I pointed this out to our server and she rudely said it was because she had to throw out the original Sandwhich. I've never experienced this before at a restaurant where I was charged for an item I didn't ask for!!
For this reason we will not b returning. 1 star for the great beer choices and the other for the awesome cheese platter."}
{"text":"Newmarket was the last place I'd expect to find a place like this but I'm glad we did.  The beer selection here, as mentioned by others, is top notch.  Whatever style you like, you will find it here.  Embarrassingly, we ordered three meals for two people, the hot dog stuffed with fries, burger, and a beef sangwich.  The dog and burger was out of this world, the sandwich was good but pales in comparison to those masterpieces.  Ambience and service was great, the owner also came by to chat with us, which seemed genuine and not forced.  Good times. One of the Best bar/gastro pub I been to in the gta and beyond."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places in historic downtown Newmarket. It is on main street and close to great amenities such as Riverwalk Commons. 

It is a cute, modern, hipster pub with great food and beers on tap. 

The service is always good and food = delicious.

They have some good fusion offerings and original recipes. One of my favourites is the HBH burger, the chickpea mash (chickpeas, avocado, kale on multigrain bread), and their lunch time  chicken sandwich with pimento cheese, and spicy mayo. 

If you are getting the fries, always ask for the garlic aioli or curry ketchup!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and close friend to celebrate my new job. Lovely atmosphere, fun staff and unique decor. It's hip, trendy and has a phenomenal beer selection! We ordered a bunch of things, marinated olives, you get lots for like $3- great to share. Tried the  roasted bone marrow based on all the great reviews we saw about it, was interesting but not really my thing- they let us keep the bones though to bring home for our dog which was a really great treat for her too. We also had the Woodsy Pizza, delicious and easy to share. The bacon fat pop corn, yum, and the Charcuterie board which had an amaaazing selection of delicious meats and cheeses etc. for an extremely reasonable price! At the end of the meal, we were well fed and watered and the bill was only around $100 for the 3 of us. I would highly recommend this gastropub to anyone looking for something a little special in the York Region- great for date night, and they have rooms for group parties of corporate events. Can't wait to go back and try more from that intriguing menu!!"}

Its like being a Toronto Leafs fan....they just don't care ...it will continue to be busy without correcting the problem and or caring about the customer! Good luck!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the unique decor/layout. Good vibes there. Friendly people good drinks. Im a picky eater so i dont care much for most of the menu, (lots of bone marrow, mushrooms) but i must say, they do have the best nachos ive ever had. The bbq pork is always loaded on and the stout sriracha is to-die-for. Also the frites with the garlic aioli and curry ketchup are incredible. Had a couple other things there but those are definitely my absolute favourite. Can get very busy/crowded on weekend evenings, as is to be expected, but usually with great, fast service. I constantly tell people to visit, even just for the nachos."}

{"text":"Located in the heart of historic Newmarket main street, Hungry Brew Hops has rustic yet hipster atmosphere. Just stepping into the place, I knew I would be wanting to stay here a while and I'd probably be having a beer (they have them on tap and they always switch it up so pick any one and I'm sure it'll be fantastic!) with my dinner. I was met with great service and an extensive menu. 

We ordered the bone marrow (this was fine but nothing to call home about -- I'd definitely suggest getting another appetizer) to start and each picked our own burgers. I picked the HBH burger and my friend ended up picking the sure-fire burger. Both were cooked perfectly and came out piping hot with delicious crispy fries. I was definitely impressed by how good these burgers were for what they were.  

Hungry Brew Hops doesn't mess around when it comes to beer and pub food -- definitely coming back when I'm in the area!"}

I asked them to make me a flight based on my fav beer being mill st organic and all 5 selections were honestly just awful. The food was really sub-par as well. So why am I still giving 4 stars despite all this negativity? The atmosphere is so unexpected for Newmarket - it really does have a Toronto vibe to it and I think if you know what you like to drink it's a great place to go have a few beers. 

Be warned that it is extremely loud inside and not stroller friendly."}
{"text":"I love the beer at this place.  Great selection.  Bruno, Luke, Randy at the bar makes you feel like at home.  Bruno is super friendly and has a great sense of humour.  Somehow he always finds me a seat at the bar.  The food is great and the menu changes frequently."}
{"text":"If you're a beer drinker this is the place to be. It's great that you can order a Flight of beers (4 samplers)  so you can try all the different types. Definitely call ahead to put your name on a waiting list  as wait times are super long during peak hours and the restaurant is small. As for food, I have been here on 2 occasions and my verdict is ok only. Had a sandwich the first time and it was plain, nothing special- chicken was super dry and falling apart in the bread. Today I had the steak & frites; steak was very good and flavourful but again my fries were too well done as was it last time as well. Check your condiments on plate before you eat as well.. I got a \"used\" ketchup dipping container off from another guests plate.. it just didn't look right after I compared mine to my husband's and friends ketchup container so that was a bit of turn off for me. Anyways.. good place for beers... and OK only for snacks. I wouldn't recommend dinner here and like others were also saying this definitely is NOT a place for groups +.. too small and you will be waiting forever!"}
{"text":"Went to HBH a few times during the summer. The patio is a great spot to sit and people watch. Their Caesars (drink) was full of flavour. Much better then your average Caesar. We had the platter with different meats and cheeses. It also included delicious house pickled veg which I would buy and eat by the jar of I could."}
{"text":"This place is among the very best Newmarket has to offer. The food is seriously good. I highly recommend the Woodsy pizza and the HBH burger. My wife and I generally order those two items and split them. Just fantastic.

Nice modern industrial brewery themed interior. Not the most comfortable furniture in the high top booths or the front room stools. We've sat int he front several times and it's pretty uncomfortable. My wife's back is usually hurting by the end of the meal. I'd ask to sit at a regular table in the back.

I would have given this place 5 stars but for the service. We always seem to get sat in the very front of the restaurant. Not sure if we just had bad servers or if they seem to forget about us in that front area with most of the action in the restaurant more towards the back. I'm not usually one to let a little lapse in service massively effect my review of a place. Generally I like taking my time with a meal and enjoying conversation. But I don't particularly love waiting 20min for my bill or 15 min for a drink.

Overall the food here is a 5 star for sure. In my experience the service is probably a 3. DEFINITELY check it out for yourself. If you like pub fair with a higher class touch, this place is for you. And I didn't even mention the great selection of beer and other drinks from the bar.

In my opinion Brew Hops is probably the best food on Main St. Newmarket."}
{"text":"Outstanding on all fronts. It's so good that I will keep it short and only say that you must go there and try it and you will not be disappointed. Just go. End of story."}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place sooner!  You walk in and the decor is great, not your typical York region place. It's way more trendy/hipster than you would usually find.

We were seated quickly on a Sunday afternoon and had a wonderful server!  She guided me through choosing my beer flight (I think they have about 30 draft beers).  Can't go wrong with 4 different beers!  They were all delicious and different.  It's definitely worth trying the spicy stout.

It was so hard choosing from their amazing menu.  My husband and I split the Pork Belly Banh Mi and the burger with philly cheese steak and onions.  The Banh Mi seemed a little skimpy on the pork belly, but it had great flavor.  The Burger also was perfectly seasoned, but overcooked.  The sides we ordered with them were both perfect.  The fries were fresh, hot and perfectly crisp.  The beet salad was well dressed and I loved the goat cheese and walnuts on it.

We will be back to try more great food and beer."}
{"text":"Man oh man are you in for a treat, let me claim I don't drink so I am in no position to judge the beer. That out of the way the service in this place was snappy and nice, I forgot who served me but everyone there was was just great. Now to go in depth with the food, I ordered a classic fish+chips which was delectable and totally worth the wait. Now go, try it yourself then tell your friends and your uncle."}
{"text":"Great food, great brews, great service! If you can't get parking out front, there's a parking lot in the back.

Had the nachos (fantastic) and wings (just OK)."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of the nicest bars in Newmarket, or at least main street newmarket ! 
Its normally always busy and a bit of a wait time hut since we got here at quarter after ten on a Wednesday, it wasn't too busy for a change! 
They had the late night menu, which is a fraction of their regular menu, but I was dying to try the charcuterie board (which was not on the late night menu) so I asked our server and he was nice enough to make it happen ! 
The charcuterie board (or the chefs board they call it) was so delicious there was nothing left by the end ! They had a good variety of meats and cheese and a delicious pineapple puree! 
We also split the cauliflower dip that I will definitely be getting again, it was tossed in sweet chilli Thai dressing (my favourite) 
Would definitely recommend coming here for a late night snack or a mid day meal. Besides the high volume of people, I've never had a complaint here."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere.
Something that you would expect Downtown T.O.
Nice to have more variety in town."}
{"text":"For a soft opening this place is pretty jumping. 

5 star goes towards the food, which was spectacular.  
Atmosphere and decor was pretty unique since it was built inside a formal bank. 

Wide selection of craft beers and delicious drink. 

Roasted bone marrow to start, delicious. 

Had the curry lamb pot pie. Lamb was cooked just right, curry wasnt too spicy and the fries had a kick to it, cooked just right! 

Husband had beer braised beef short ribs, which was very flavorful.  The beef was thoroughly cooked yet extremely tender and soft. 

Keep in mind this restaurant only opened 3 days ago on feb 6th, so food was still served a bit slow and everything just a tad chaotic. The other thing to keep in mind is the open concept kitchen,  which was neat but did allow the smoke to enter dining area. Depends on whether you like the smell of food being cooked or not. 

 have no doubt this place will get better as time goes on. 

Will go back for sure!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have had lunch and dinner at this trendy restaurant a few times since they opened. I especially like their late-night menu and hours. So many other establishments are closed in Newmarket so it's nice to have an option for a late Saturday night. I have had the bacon fat popcorn, the frites, the HBH burger, the margherita pizza, and some of their desserts. Their selection of beer is quite good. We especially like the presentation of the flight of beer. Service is always good. It does become loud when it's a full house but it adds to the ambiance. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Very friendly place with freat food and beer.
We will definitely come back again !
We had the birgers , salmon and tacos and everything was fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"Wow! ..First off, I didn't even know there was a main street newmarket.. I am impressed! A group of us stopped by after being in the area for a axe throwing event, and we were famished. A few of us had been here before and it was definitely a recommendation, so why the hell not? 

The place itself is very nice and classy, with a rustic feel to it. We got a table at the back, which had great space and it made us feel as if we were in a more private area. Right off the bat, we were informed that we had to pay a 18% gratuity because we were a group of 8. Meh, I'm not a fan of restaurants that do that so one star knocked off. The service was ok, she came back several times to check on us and she was patient was us even though it was that time of the night and we were being a slightly rowdy bunch, asking many questions and blah blah blah. I am a huge fan of their decor (they have this water jug that reminds me of trafficking moonshine) and wall murals (tobermory painting on the wall). I'm also a fan of places where you can see the open kitchen from where you're sitting. Don't know why, but that's just the way it is. 

Once I saw bone marrow on the menu, I HAD to get it- I've always wanted to try, but it's hard to find. It was $9 and it was delicious!! Salted/spiced just right and the bone fat just melted onto the toast, and then in my mouth shortly after. HUGE FAN. The bbq pork nachos were also on point. Usually when I spend $15 on nachos at caucasian restaurants, I end up getting loads of cheese/tomatoes/bullshit on top of soggy tostito chips. This dish was baked to perfection, with juicy/tender pulled pork piled on top of crispy nachos. That's right- crispy. As in, every single piece that touched my mouth was crispy and crunchy. Perfection. On top of that, it was a serving big enough for a giant. (or my boyfriend, in that case) The other dishes that our group ordered were also good, but their fries were a bit plain and left my tongue bored. I heard their curry ketchup was interesting though? Their drink menu is also extensive and they have beers and cocktails that I've never even heard of. I had this grapefruit/citrus beer (can't remember the name) and it was the perfect cider to go with a meal.

I'll definitely come back to newmarket to try more dishes.. or maybe just get the bone marrow.. but I'll definitely come with less than 7 people to escape the forced gratuity. (seriously, even high end places only charge 15-20% for super large groups, and certainly not to a group our size)"}
{"text":"I heard this place served bone marrow and that was enough to pull us in for Mother's day.

I was blown away. Fantastic beer selection, wonderful and knowledgable staff, great food.

We had the bone marrow, bbq pork nachos, ribs, fried chicken, smoked duck pasta and cheesecake. All wondeful.

The only negative thing I have to note is the burger was underwhelming and seemed to be somewhat bellow the quality and cretivity of the other dishes. Something for them to work on.

If you're looking for a mind-expanding beer selection and food to match, look no further."}
{"text":"Came here a few months back during a Yelp event and I was super impressed with the samples of the food they offered.  I remember the sticky ribs, signature burger and fries were awesome!  My guest from the event also wanted to come back and try their regular menu, so she and I decided to come here on a weeknight for dinner and also to catch up on our lives.

Since we both wanted to try something else, we ordered food items that were not offered last time at the event except for the fries.  Unfortunately, it did not meet our expectations!

The fries are still good, they are fried in lard so it's very tasty but unhealthy at the same time.  However, the mayo and ketchup that come with the fries made it super good and make you forget how deadly the fries are.  The ketchup is in a typical red colour, however, you can taste curry in it!  The daily special pizza was also good, thin-crusted and had lots of toppings, the presto base made it taste extra good!  However, from here on all the other food we ordered had a common theme, SALTINESS.

Ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow and it comes with a few slices of burchetta, it looked very special, but was super salty and I didn't feel too special about it.  We also ordered the oxtail goat cheese raviolis, and it was very salty also, and we both felt the raviolis were kind of hard.

This place is pretty far from where i live, however, I will come back here another time to order some of their signature dishes to see if they are much better."}
{"text":"You can often tell how good a place is by how full it is. My first time here will not likely be my last. Fresh, we'll seasoned steak and a home brew paired nicely was accompanied by sweet potatoes yams and fingerling veg. The service was attentive and the interior, while crowded, had a nice homey air to it. A nice part of a main street area which feels right @ home."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... Awesome selection of beer both on tap and bottle. Friendly and helpful staff. And two words \"bone marrow\" omg... So good."}
{"text":"Forget about the beer, it's about the food!  Yes, I know they have 26,592 varieties of beer, but you can get all of them somewhere else.  But the food is made right there, right then.

I stopped in on a Thursday night for dinner.  I had been wanting to try HBH for some time.  I picked a night where it was very busy, but I guess it's busy any evening.  The bar was full, nearly every table was full, and the noise level was full volume.

I ordered the Farfalle with Prosciutto and Shrimp for $18 and the Vanilla Sparkling  Orange for a refreshing non-alcoholic bevy.  The pasta dish arrived looking as good as it would taste.  The shrimp were not overcooked, the prosciutto was salty and fresh, and the noodles were incredibly good.  The buttery pesto sauce was laced with parmesan in addition to the large shavings of parmesan on top.  I ate every morsel.

I would have liked to see a few more shrimp in the dish.  Four medium shrimp seems a bit light (yes, I counted the shrimp, you can tell a lot from the protein to carb ratio), for $18 a couple more would be nice.

This is not the place to go for a quiet dinner, expect lots of noise, and lots of beer.  But that's why you go there, right?"}
{"text":"Came for dinner and drinks with friends. Good atmosphere and love that they have a gastropub on Main Street.

Service was slow but very friendly. They were busy so it was understandable.

We all ordered something different and like the taste of most things (especially the cauliflower fritters!) except the beet salad wasn't really a beet salad...more like a salad with beets on it. Portions for all meals and apps were generous!

Unfortunately, the downside was the cleanliness. Our table was very sticky, even after being wiped down. The worst was our glasses: three of them smelled like urine! Eeeewww! I doubt it was actually pee, but likely the glasses were wiped down with a dirty bar rag. Blech!

Despite that \"ick\" factor, still giving 3 stars because the service was very friendly and atmosphere was good. I would try it again, but sniff the glasses before drinking from them!!"}
{"text":"What a cool place in Newmarket!

I'll keep this one short, besides the wait times and a bit of uncomfortable seating, this place is a must to check out if you're in the area.

Great drinks (beer sangria anyone?), awesome food, great staff, cool vibe, what more can you ask for?

Group of 4 of us got the Curry Bowl, the Jerk Hummus, the Lamb Shank and the Pulled Pork Nachos and all walked away super satisfied. Can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"The service alone is worth five stars!!  We had Alia as our waitress and she was very good. Not overbearing but appeared just in time all the time throughout the night! And very accommodating!!  I am taking on  healthy clean eating to lose my last couple of pounds and was dreading going out for dinner but really wanted to see my nephew and his wife.  I asked for rare flat iron steak on greens without dressing ... It is very time consuming to make flat iron steak rare, yet they did and it was fabulous. Our waitress never even batted an eye when I asked for no dressing which was nice to see ... My nephew had the ribs which he absolutely loved but he ordered the poutine as an appie and they were so delicious he couldn't finish his ribs!  His wife had the salad and like mine was massive!!! We all asked for take out boxes and boxed the rest of our delicious meals to finish tomorrow!! 

We loved the atmosphere of the place and felt like we had our own separate area as we were seated at the back in a corner area which was awesome as we had my great nephew as well with us who is a baby. 

It was a little loud, but that was because everyone was talking and enjoying themselves. Great beers to choose from for my nephew and they even had some wines as well - if I was able to drink - that's what I would have ordered. So, nice they have something for everyone. Just like the menu itself - from burgers to ribs to salads. I also had the mussels for an appie which were awesome! 

And apparently their donut for dessert is to die for ... But we just couldn't do it. 

Awesome atmosphere, service, friendliness and food!!!! 

And finally one last point was that the woman cleaning off our table was super friendly and asked how everything was and to come back soon!  As well / every waitress we passed on the way out made eye contact and said to have a great day!  Awesome!!! 

And pps: they bring a massive and nice decanter of water to your table and bring another as it diminishes! Just an extra nice touch!"}
{"text":"Hungry Brew Hops fills an otherwise disturbing void of 'gastropub' variety in Newmarket. Gone are the days where locals must rely on the likes of Milestones or worse, Kelsey's to grab a pint and enjoy a dinner. After my experience, I think another trip North is in order, if just to offer the food another shot. 

I placed the sub-genre, gastropub in quotation due to the sheer subjectiveness of the term. I've been spoiled by some creative meals served alongside local brew. HBH offers a decent meal, but I would rather simply refer to it as a restaurant with a vast and diverse beer selection.  

Famished, I ordered the Mac and Cheese to begin and got to split an order of fries. Both were disappointingly underwhelming. The Mac and Cheese was absolutely bland, the fries,  acceptable, though lead to a bittersweet beginning only brightened by the ambiance and draught list. I enjoyed a pint of the devastatingly glorious Hannepin. 

Next came my entree, the HBH burger. I was expecting something of a miraculous save to an otherwise sombre introduction to their menu - HBH burger certainly delivered. I'm usually not one for a very meaty meal, but this burger was very fresh, with gorgeous caramelized onions and the patty, flavoured like a naughty temptress. 

Because of the hedonist I am, I decided to finish myself off with a mason jar of Tiramisu. It was essentially a jar of mascarpone with ladyfingers - lots of missing ingredients here. 

The grand finale was butchered. End scene. 

3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Passing through on a work trip, this was a great spot to relax with good food and great beers. Being from the States, we had to indulge on some poutine. Cheese was shredded, I always thought cheese curds were authentic but I could be wrong! Bottom line, you can't go wrong with crispy fries, rich gravy, and melted cheese. 

Steak and Frites (because I didn't have enough fries apparently) was good. Steak was topped with a pat of duck fat butter but I found myself wishing there was au jus which maybe tells me the steak wasn't juicy or flavorful enough? I'm no expert, and it was good, but it felt like some small finishing touch was missing. 

Beer selection was extensive and high quality - overall a great choice in a cozy yet hip setting for good food and drink."}
{"text":"Cool place. Very much enjoyed our lunch there - yes - they were open for lunch (their hours were wrong). Great beer selection. Their local one is very light. Almost too light but some enjoyed it. They have a great and affordable lunch menu. Everything was around $10. Good service, good menu, great food.  I had the hotdog and loved it. The grilled cheese was a little overdone. Cool place (like I said). A little pricy - but worth a visit."}
{"text":"Loved this hipster place food was awesome and beer was local and cold. Place is busy but quick arrival of food. The hamburgers were awesome and fresh"}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing food! Fantastic beer selection! LOVE the new addition which is the patio! They need to open another shop up in Barrie but it's worth the drive to Newmarket!!!"}
{"text":"After many rounds of the lovely house lager, I'm pretty sure the Chickpea Smash-Up Sandwich saved my life. It is a stacked dish of multigrain bread hugging chunky smashed chickpeas, silky pea purée, silvers of avocado, tart pickled red onion, peppery arugula, and a rich kale pesto. I was surprised to find anything vegan on the menu and then shocked by the creativity placed in every layer of the sandwich."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to visit this place last night with some friends and I could not be more pleased with my experience. We shared the bone marrow which was amazing though you might not want to share! I had the sticky ribs which just about fell off the bone, and the sauce they were covered in was sweet, tangy, and had just a bit of a kick. I tried some of my friends' food and can also vouch for the steak frites and pulled pork nachos. We all split the donut of the day to finish things off. The food was great and I honestly can't say there was anything I didn't enjoy.

The tables felt a bit squished together near the back and with the staff walking by things got a tad claustrophobic at times. Overall however the servers were friendly and attentive even though the place was packed.

I would highly recommend Hungry Brew Hops if you're looking for a quality gastropub experience in the Newmarket area."}
{"text":"Server great but your so squished right beside everyone It's awful. No privacy food was quite tasty but won't go back because your way to squished felt like we were at a party of 8 cuz people all around when it was just a party of 2."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice now, and both times were a different experience.

First time we went, the food blew my mind. I had the surefire burger, mussels and bone marrow and a strawberry donut for dessert. The food was phenomenal. But the service was a bit shotty, waitress was slow and a little bit unpleasant. But I was willing to look past that, because the food was just so good. Also, they have so many beers on tap. Win. 

Flash forward a couple of months later, to my second visit. The three of us ordered a bunch of stuff to share. Surefire burger, which was a complete miss this time. The pizza special, which was just okay. Bone marrow again, because how can you go wrong with bone marrow. Roasted Brussels sprouts which other than the face it was overly seasoned with black pepper, was quite nice. And the daily donut, WASN'T EVEN A DAMN DONUT! It was something they described as their version of a Passion Flakey. Ugh, wrong. At least those things are good. The thing that really irked me this time was the service. Again. And I guess the food just wasn't as great as last time so it bugged me even more this time. 

So.. damn.. slow.. 

We were seated before 2 other tables in our section, and our drink orders taken first. And we were ready to order too, but guess what. Our server decided to ignore us and serve the other 2 tables first. Why? I don't know, but it pissed me off. 

Also, we sat right by the kitchen, so we were able to see a lot of what was going on. They used microwave popcorn bags for their popcorn dish. LOL. Also, using store bought canned whipped cream and Chapman's ice cream for dessert. LOL. LOL is all I can say."}
{"text":"HBH does not disappoint.   Well, maybe when you have to wait an hour for a table.  The beer selection is the best in York Region, hands-down.  The food is great:  Everything from the bone marrow appetizer, the Chef's charcuterie platter, to the short rib, and one of the best burgers anywhere.  One of the first places in the area that I actually WANT to go back to.  Here's hoping more places open up with the same attention to food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice bar on Main St. Newmarket, it got the same ambience as gastro bars in downtown Toronto.  They have a great selection of beers to choose from, servers are always friendly and nice.  Food selection is limited but enough for bar food-they are also creative and delicious. Not your ordinary bar food.  I tried their burgers and cauliflower and sandwiches before, both were hearty and tasted fresh, perfect to go with a beer!"}
{"text":"The interior is all wood, which I really like. They have a small patio out front as well. They have a wonderful selection of craft beers, or so my beer-drinking friends tell me :) They have tall tables and regular tables. The service was friendly and attentive.
There is plenty of free parking in a communal lot out back.
They have some really unique items on the menu, including a cauliflower grilled cheese sandwich (lunch), which is quite tasty and a good deal for $9.
You can rent the whole restaurant out for events and it can accommodate up to 150 people. I would recommend this restaurant to the Newmarket crowd!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice selection of beer. Staff was pretty good as well which allowed us to try beer at our own pace instead of being rushed out to get new customers in. Overall, nice to see newmarket modernizing with a brew house!"}
{"text":"Amazing beer and drink selection. Atmosphere and decor has a rustic/industrial feel which is phenomenal. The food is out of this world, have yet to eat something I did not like, I would recommend the burger and pulled pork nachos (I've been here more than a handful of times, ordering different items on the menu and these are my favs). This place is definitely in my top 10. Never disappointing!"}
{"text":"No complaints here! We've been here a few times as I don't like to review a place based on one visit. The beer selection is great and so is the service. The burgers were moist and I love the bone marrow. The Brussels sprouts were well cooked. We also liked the kids menu. Our kids shared a kid cheese pizza as it was really big. Then got 2 orders of kid fries. It was more than enough. Overall great place for a night out or a family meal."}
{"text":"Love the decor and fun vibe. It's a cool place to hang out and grab beers after work, or to get a delicious and reasonably priced dinner. It's on Main St., the main strip in Newmarket, and seems to be a popular option among the locals.

I've been here twice but I've only ever ordered one thing. Their cauliflower fritters are to die for (beer-battered cauliflower, green onions, sweet chili, house dill sauce). There's a great contrast of texture between the softer cauliflower and the crispy batter, and they come out nice, hot and fresh. The sweet chili and house dill sauce go really well and add flavour to the dish ($9). 

This place is known to be one of the best in Newmarket and the service is fantastic. All their beers come from micro-breweries so it's great if you're a connoisseur and want to try out some new flavours. You can get wine by the ounce, which I think is awesome for people who want to try multiple selections. 

I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for dinner on Sat. Was very busy but were able to grab a drink and snack at the bar as we waited for our table. Their beer list was very extensive and offered options for all tastes. 

Once we were seated we ordered our food right away. It arrived very fast especially for having a table of 6 and the overall restaurant was very busy. The service was very good but nothing compared to the food. One of the best burgers I've had in a long time. 

The only downside to drop it from 5 stars and almost dropped it to 3 stars was the seating. Many of the seats on the one side consisted of bench style seats. These seats were shared between 2 table with a very small ridge dividing them. If you don't mind being bumped constantly by the person behind you or having their huge coats, bags and purses spilling into your already limited space then you will have no issues. 

While an interesting concept, it really doesn't work and makes for an awkward and uncomfortable experience. Luckily the great beer, good service and fantastic food makes up for this a lot."}
{"text":"Hbh! So couple of us yelpers decided to come here to grab a bite to eat after the yelp event. First thing I noticed was the floors were quite slippery, which is quite dangerous in a bar scene! Also as we sat down we were told there was an 18% gratuity included since we had 7 people. It says on the menu *subject to 18%* i didnt get a chance to ask what makes it 18% or not. The service was ok, server made sure we had lots of water! 
                                                       
I had the pulled pork nachos and bone marrow. The bone marrow is definitely something ive never tried and is quite unique to eat. Or at least to me it is. I am not a fan of it as i like something more solid. Definitely something to try though! The menu is quite unique and as i dont remember some items. Most are not what you would find at your local bar or restaurant. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"After reading some great yelp reviews, I decided to give Hungry Brew Hops a try for a quick early dinner. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the bartender offered her suggestions as I hemmed and hawed over the menu. I saw about five things I could've ordered, and I chose the chickpea smash with fries. The sandwich was good - the avocado was perfectly ripe and the pickled onions added some kick- but I wasn't wild about the kale pesto. The fries were SO good. I'm already itching to go back to sample the beers and the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and was not disappointed. This is a savvy joint with some modern art on the walls and perfect for a birthday dinner, which is exactly what we were doing here. The moderate pricing and upscale feel of Hungry Brew Hops was very welcome with my incredibly picky family.
In my residence it is always a difficult task choosing where to eat, we are a picky crowd with a mix of regulars and more diverse individuals, which means that food needs to have the basics and the not so basics. Luckily Hungry Brew Hops has something for everyone: burgers, chicken sandwiches, muscles, bacon fat popcorn (yes you did read that correctly) plus a wide array of beer on tap to test. 
I had the muscles, jalapeno cornbread and soup of the day: roasted red pepper bisque with rice...all in all an amazing meal. The muscles were a tad spicy, just the way I like in a cream broth with green onions and red peppers, served with two sides of toast. I was in love with this dish even more so since the muscles were surprisingly large and there were A LOT of them. The jalapeno cornbread was light, fluffy and dense, it came with four small round pieces and a little tin of butter, if that's what you're in to. This is a perfect dish to share and we took advantage of this aspect. The soup was good, the rice in the bisque made it feel a bit like I was eating porridge, in a not so great kind of way. 
The service was a little slow but it was a Saturday night, so that's understandable. 
I am really glad we came here, everyone in my picky group was really impressed and we all had a great time."}
{"text":"Very nice pub, best in the area. Good food, lots of tap beers including a nice selection of IPA's. Hamburgers are all great."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to have dinner here after several failed attempts (this place gets busy on weekends and they don't take resos!! .. the website says you can call ahead to be put on the waiting list 30 mins ahead..when we called we were told no reservations and that was it, odd.).

I ordered the HBH Burger with fries. The burger was very messy (wet/saucy) and I found it to be too flavourful/salty after a few bites. The fries were delicious at first but were also very, very salty. The food on the menu doesn't really excite me.. probably won't be back.

The service here was slow; although plenty of staff, I had to wait a very long time to see my server again to ask her for more water and for the bill."}
{"text":"Beer, beer and more beer!

I'd like to start this review by saying this gastro pub deserves more than a 3/5 when referring to their food and beer selection. The beer assortment is sure to quench your thirst and the food offers a variety of rich samples from different cultures. I've tried the shrimp pasta in a cream herb sauce (to die for), root veggies as a snack, bacon popcorn, Thai chicken wings and the pork belly sandwich. All were great. The reason why I'm giving this place 3/5 is because their service needs some revamping. 

Each time I've come to visit, the place is packed! That's not a complaint in my books by any means. What sucks is I feel they cannot keep up with the number of people. Often, you wait a good 10-15 minutes before your bevy even arrives at the table, if you're lucky enough to get a table. The bar tender is great; he suggests many types of beers to you if you're uncertain what to drink. He'll find you a great match... but don't count on him to be readily available to take your food order. The food comes out quickly but just getting anyone's attention to take your order is difficult. The place is always hoppin' but the service lacks. They are friendly and courteous; they just need more of them!

The overall price is reasonable & there's tons of parking in the complex behind the bar. Although service is a big thing to me, food is more important so I will keep coming back! As Christina R mentioned, a patio would be amazing."}
{"text":"An interesting location for a spot like this, you probably couldn't tell what this place is walking along Main especially with the variety of places around that don't quite agree with gastropub. Either an advance knowledge or intuition most definitely required.

A vast and temporary list of draft beers- I was informed that five or six change on a regular basis but not which- was clipped on top of the menus handed out; far from merely suggesting that diners partake. It's one of very few beer menus I've ever seen that doesn't list where its beers originate (I looked up the one I ordered to discover that my guess of Belgium was correct) and with the variety of local-ish microbrews available with a smattering of Europeans and the odd American, well, a clue is usually expected. Beers seemed a little flatter than usual on draft but the selection is an interesting one. I'd go back for a 'flight'- a choice of four of the draft selections.

Food here was also touch and go. Woodsy pizza was incredible due to marinated roast garlic and a balsamic drizzle that gratefully overpowered the rest of the flavours. Mediterranean pizza was bland and boring in comparison. \"Belgian\" frites were totally wrong: no real Belgian would think of either pouring salt all over them before serving or serving them with ketchup.

Service was by far the saving grace. Not enough can be said for quality customer service and knowledge of a menu, both beverage and food. I appreciate a server who can laugh at my poor attempts at humour and who actually returns to the table in a couple minutes when asked to give another couple minutes to peruse a menu.

3.5-4/5"}
{"text":"Went for supper last week - first time there. I really like that there is finally a 'gastropub' in Newmarket. Location is great - right on Main Street and a short walk from Fairy Lake. Décor is cool and atmosphere is nice. Feels like you are Downtown Toronto! Greeted right away and the service was good. Menu has something for everyone. I ordered the duck fat fries (tasty) and the kale salad with beets and goat cheese (also tasty). Also ordered the $10 beer flight - this was the highlight of the meal. Overall, good experience. Good drinks, good food, good company. Four solid stars."}
{"text":"By far one of the best Gastro pubs I have been to. My boyfriend and I ordered the bone marrow to start. It was flavourful, the marrow just melted in your mouth. I ordered the chickpea avocado mash sandwich. It was refreshing and very light! Delicious nonetheless. Its a good choice if you want something satisfying but not meat. My boyfriend ordered the Pablo pizza and loved it! Also try the Phil Collins, a delicious gin and beer combo!"}
{"text":"I so, so wanted this place to be a new favourite but I was underwhelmed, though some things we had were nice. I had 4 things on the menu while I was here (came for the food, not the beer.. I know, for shame). I shared with my dining partner. We had the bone marrow to start, which was worth all the hype and was the best thing I think. We also had the chef's plate, which is market price and came to $17 when we checked the bill. Though this sounds expensive, it was absolutely not expensive for the quantity. The chef's plate is enough for 3-4 people as the only appetizer. It had olives, sundried tomatoes, 3 kinds of meat, 3 kinds of cheese (blue, goat, and provologne), olives, dijon mustard, pickles, and jam (very skimpy on the jam for some reason) with toasted baguette. This was also a hit.
For mains we shared a burger and the beef cheeks. The burger I found very overrated after reading the reviews on here. It seemed to lack seasoning and I am already forgetting what it tasted like because unfortunately it was very forgettable. I would not order it again. The beef cheeks were definitely not forgettable. This very rich dish was seasoned much better, though not perfectly. The meat was not as delicious as the butternut squash it sat atop. However, though this dish stands out as something different from the norm, it would not be enough to tempt me back. Overall, the appetizers were much better than the mains.
As others have noted, the food is good - 3.5 or 4 stars overall. However, the service is seriously, seriously lacking. Even after reading about the service here on Yelp I still was shocked at how bad it was. Two things stood out to me: 
1) I ordered the vanilla orange soda since we were not drinking. The waitress returned with my partner's drink and let me know that the bartender had to go 'downstairs' to refill/replace the soda, so it would be a few minutes. She asked if I would like something else or if I wanted to wait for him to change it. I said it was no problem and I would wait. I am not kidding you the drink did not come all evening and after FINISHING my main, the waitress had never returned to apologize or anything and I had to flag her down and tell her that at this point I did not want the soda any more. I did not mind waiting a 'few minutes' but not having my drink over 45 minutes later was shocking to me. How can you not change soda if it's out AND you have a customer waiting for it??
2) I won't go into details, but there were several examples of a lack of knowledge about the food. Do not expect the waitstaff to be able to answer any of your food questions; this was true for both us and the table seated next to us.

Service was a 2/5 at best."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant/bar in the heart of Newmarket. Staff are friendly. Wait time to be seated was short. Different menu. We shared muscles and bone marrow + beef cheeks as an appetizer. The mussels were small and many shells were empty.  The sauce was flavourful. For our main course i ordered the braised beef short rib. Came with roasted root vegetables and mashed potatoes in a stout gravy. Not a huge fan. My son had the pork shank. It was fatty and chewy.  His meal came  with broccoli warm wheatberry salad and sauerkraut.  As we watched other meals come out of the kitchen we realized we just ordered the wrong meal. The burgers looked delicious, maybe next time  we will give that a try."}
{"text":"Awesome discovery.. try the bone marrow outstanding.. then did the pulled pork sandwich with potato chips.. on a light flat bread.  The great atmosphere and service is refreshing."}
{"text":"So unique and different from any normal restaurant in Newmarket. Amazing location, food and service. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They update their menu all the time, so they never get boring. I keep on coming back to try different things, but sadly I can't go out for dinner everyday."}
{"text":"Came here after a Y.E.E. recently with a few elites. 

Firstly, I was not impressed w/ the auto 18% gratuity as our group had 7 people. Even though the service was good (I could have filled water in a jug too), the extra 3% was not justified. Tips should be earned. Otherwise, what's the point? This was also the reason I decided not to order anything else but my burger. But at least HBH told us about the 18% in advance & didn't charge us for water unlike another burger place in Markham. 

I ordered the HBH burger, which I have been wanting to try again after having it at the Hungry Brew Hops Y.E.E. It was delicious. But I thought it was better the first time around. It was definitely cooked to perfection. 

I did not like the fries that came with the meal as it was not crunchy enough. Not a fan of soggy fries.

Would definitely like to come back again to try more things if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent addition and alternative to an area that desperately needs some diversity and an upscale drinking spot. They do a great job here.


My only complaint is there really isn't much in terms of 'healtheir' options so if you're eating here - accept the fact that you might pay for it at the gym later."}
{"text":"Came with a friend since she loves beer and I love food. It's on main st and very close to the free parking so it isn't a far walk. Greeted by two lovely ladies once we walked in. After being seated it didn't take long for our server to come and put down the menus to give us a few minutes to decide. It was really nice for her to take a short run down on the menu. I knew I had to try the bone marrow for the appetizer. The bone marrow was literally perfection! It melted in my mouth with the gooey goodness. We shared two entrees which was the sticky ribs and the sweet chilli wings. I wasn't expecting much at all from the sweet chilli wings since every restaurant usually makes it around the same but the difference was that these wings weren't breaded and there was no burnt taste to it. It was cooked to perfection with the right amount of marinade. It's literally mouth watering good. The sticky ribs weren't bad either it came with corn bread on the side and the ribs definitely are a go to if you need to satisfy your rib craving. The ambience of this place is comforting and just the perfect amount of brightness/dimness to fit the atmosphere and theme of this place. It's not the \"best\" but it's definitely above average."}
{"text":"Love the beer sangria!! Miss the pear cider and the pork belly tacos. 

Service is slow. All the time.

I do not recommend coming here with a large group of people. They definitely neglect you the whole time. The two times I've come here with my work family we've had the WORST ATTITUDE AND THE WORST SERVICE. Who knows why we even come back, probably because they're the only spot on Main Street that's open on a Monday. Anyways we will no longer be coming back and I definitely don't recommend coming unless it's just you and one other person."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beer. Good is food
 a little pricey but worth it. Pulled pork nochos are a must."}
{"text":"I love the unique food and atmosphere this place has.  

Great food, great place for a Friday night but only problem is that it is way too busy.  Really hard to get a table here.  I know that everyone loves the bone marrow, it's not for me though.... A little too oily but first time I ever had it so maybe that's just the way it is.  

I loved trying their flight beers and the pretzel actually :)!! 

Can't wait to come back, if I can ever get a table :p"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing beer selection.  Wait staff Colleen was fabulous, fun and funny as well as a great server!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's day, great atmosphere and amazing waitress. We wanted to try a new place and this had great reviews and was 5 minutes from my house. They have an amazing collection of beer and wine on tap, plus their cocktails are simply delicious, you must try the beer sangria! For apps, we got the fries with garlic aioli and curry ketchup. Oh my gosh the fries were amazing and the sauces. Super simple and the fries were cooked perfectly, super crispy and soft inside. We also ordered the bacon popcorn which was okay, will not order it again. I seen a bag of microwavable popcorn on their conventional oven in the kitchen and that is prob how they make the popcorn appetizer. Throw in some fried pancetta and cheese, pancetta tasted super fishy. For main, my boyfriend got the cast iron coffee steak and it was cooked to perfection. Medium rare, super tender and flavorful! I got the snitzchel, got it from waitresses' recommendation, really should have stuck to getting the Shepard's pie. Nothing really special but the Chinese broccoli was really good. Lastly, we got the brownie with the ice cream and it was to die for. It totally made up for my snitzchel. It was soooooo delicious and heavenly! 

The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and welcoming. I love the ceilings, I couldn't stop staring at the fake vault wall. This place was very interesting and one of a kind. I would definitely come back to try everything else on their menu! Great services and amazing steak!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day dinner. Amazing vibe, beautiful environment and the service was top notch! As you know me from my reviews I'm a visual type of guy I love seeing pictures because reading what I'm going to eat is quite difficult not knowing what I'm exactly going to get. 

The server recommended the steak which I got and my girl got the snitchel which in my opinion wasn't good at all. But my steak was amazing! 

I also ordered the bacon fat popcorn which was okay I wouldn't order it again... and the French fries with the ketchup and garlic aioli sauce... omg amazing! 

The server was amazing, the food was great, except the snitchel but definitely would come back again to try some other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Came here recently, after having a chance to sample some of their goods at a prior event. Was craving both the HBH Burger (which was fantabulous the first time I had it), as well as the Beer-infused Fried chicken. Sadly, the server confirmed that there no longer is (or never was?) such a dish - perhaps it was all just some dream I had of two of my favourite things dancing together?

FOOD:

I was able to go for a full version of the HBH Burger, which did not disappoint. The patty was tender and decently-sized. While the \"Sweet Chili Aoili\" sauce came on a bit too strong for me, I'm always a fan of sauteed (and in this case beer-braised) onions by the handful.  What looked to be a Brioche bun, was soft and held the burger up nicely.

Fries were just the way I like them, one part chewy, and one part crispy. These came with sides of ketchup and mayonnaise, which is a plus in my book - you can never go wrong with mayonnaise and fries!

ATMOSPHERE:

This place has a really unique decor, not really sure how to describe it though. Seems like a great place to enjoy a fine dinner, while also enjoying drinks with friends. There's a nice patio out front, and an interesting little nook at the back of the resto where our table was placed. Loved the sliding doors that were located behind us, and the golden-coloured safe right by our table - not sure if the safe is part of the decorations, or HBH is making (and storing) boatloads of cash. Either way, it adds to the vibe of the place.

SERVICE/POLICY:

The server herself did a fine job, taking and delivering our orders. However, as much as I enjoyed the food and atmosphere of this place, it would be remiss of me not to mention the 18% auto-gratuity for \"large groups.\" In our case, our table of 7 was told before dinner that this would be added on. 

As I've mentioned in a few of my other reviews, I am adamantly opposed to such policies - a tip/gratuity is meant to reward servers for providing excellent, or at least decent service. There is no incentive to provide this, if servers know that they will be getting a large-ish tip from the get-go. If a certain percentage of gratuity is REQUIRED of customers, then restaurants might as well be transparent with this, and factor it in directly into the price. -1 STAR for this.

VERDICT:

Not a fan of the auto-gratuity, but a fan of the food and atmosphere. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's too bad it's all the way in Newmarket or else I'd be here every week.  The food is fantastic - but the real reason I come here is for their beer selection.  They have a rotational beer menu that is awesome.  It's so hard to find a bar like this north of Toronto, so HBH is a real catch.  

They're located in downtown Newmarket, so parking is tough during peak hours.  Their building also has no LTE/Cell phone reception - so you're going to have to talk to whoever you're with...like the olden days!

Please open a HBH in Richmond Hill and I'll be there all the time."}
{"text":"3.5 Star 

Are you HUNGRY?

Are you into BREWs?

Are you into HOPs? (Beer hops or bar hopping?)

Are you up North at the end of 404?

You should come here NOW!

26 Beers on draft with Great Lakes and Beau's Seasonals. A good selection of bottles too.

Food menu is quite diverse. We ordered quite a few things to try. 

HBH Burger ($15) and Grilled Chicken Cheese Sandwich ($13) were both great. Pork Belly Banh mi ($14) and Mac+Cheese ($6) were meh. 
Hand-Cut frites ($5)  was really good!
Definitely skip the Tiramisu ($6) looked cute but didn't worth the calories!

$10 for a sampler of 4 beers on tap was a great deal.

Hungry Brews Hop is an awesome addition in Newmarket Main Street area. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been to HBH twice now after stumbling on it on a Wednesday night the first time this summer. The patio was full but we were quickly seated right by the window at the front. Kirstyn (Kristen?) was fantastic and took the time to go through the extensive beer list and even taught us how to pronounce some of the German beer names. Braised beef cheeks were excellent as was the poke tuna. 
For our second visit, we arrived at 830 but the hostess advised us that the patio was once again fully booked. We were seated at the back this time and have to say it was not the same experience. We were seated in very close proximity to another table, close to the kitchen. It was very noisy and our waitress was largely unattentive. The pork nachos were MASSIVE and the steak frites were quite good as well (would have been even better if we hadn't gorged ourselves on the nachos). The seafood  tagliagelle looked pretty good as well, shrimp was a little overcooked. We would go back for a 3rd time to try our luck again. 

We love the ambiance and location of this place. The food is overall good, but most of it is quite salty (presumably to make you get more beer? Not a bad thing to be honest considering the beer list!). The service can be a hit or miss though. I would highly consider calling ahead for reservations if they accept them."}
{"text":"Amazing choices of beers. Delicious pulled pork nachos. Hbh burger is worth a try. A bit on the loud side if you wanna chat but food and drinks are excellent. Definitely a spot I would bring my friends and family to if they're coming to visit."}
{"text":"Hungry brew hops is one of my favourite places to go. Wide selection of beers and an excellent rustic industrial ambiance. The cornbread is absolutely amazing. They also have one of the best burgers for a place that isn't a burger joint. If you plan on going with a group of people go early. The place fills up fast. Eat well friends!"}
{"text":"We decided on this place for my friends birthday dinner gathering. We all live in complete opposite directions and always end up in Newmarket for our meet ups. I found this place pretty easy to find. Although I don't really spend much time in Newmarket the main street it was located on was very welcoming and gave you that small town feel. My friend has been wanting to try this place since it opened and the reason of course is because of the nature of the business. Being a brew hop means lots of beer.. and if anyone knows us girls we enjoy our beer! I decided on the Russian Stout. I enjoy all types of beer but I love my Guinness.. you would think I'd be Irish or something but nope just a girl who fell in love with that beer while visiting the country! Ok back to the main topic I chose that beer to see and compare. I felt this beer to be more smooth with a hint of coffee flavour. 

My friends also decided on some appetizers. One ordered the brussel sprouts and another friend ordered the bacon popcorn. Both were very tasty and had a unique flavour. For my main I ordered the Kale Beet Salad with chicken. My friend ordered the same dish with steak. I enjoyed my meal and cleaned up my plate while my other friend found the dressing to be a little sweet. I enjoyed the combination of the beats on the salad with the goat cheese and all the other fixings. I found they were paired nicely. 

We were completely stuffed and didn't have room for dessert. Instead we enjoyed a lovely tea over some more chit chat. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in and around the area. The service was great, the atmosphere was comfortable and the food got nothing but complements that night."}
{"text":"At a work function.  The food was good and the drinks menu was adventurous.

The only qualm was the staff wasn't very experienced with handling such a large group.  We waited for our drinks for a long time.  The portions were filling and over a good fusion menu.

The only thing I would change would be having more experience wait staff.

Our company function was on the second level and it was large enough space our group of fifty but they did forget our size and have to setup some last minute chairs and a table.

I would return if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Special tonight was pulled pork pizza. Jalapeño peppers can be taken off if too spicy for you. Good portion size for a guy who likes to eat. Great service from Sam who had to put up with a bunch of boisterous men."}
{"text":"Nice gem at the north, center of Newmarket! 

This place is awesome, decoration feels like downtown Toronto, staff are very friendly, and it's got quite a collection for beer!! 
 
The food is also very good, although I would say the portion is smaller compare to couple of years ago, hence a reduction of 1 star. But overall, you cannot go wrong with this place for gathering with friends and party!"}
{"text":"A mind-blowing selection of beers! Try the beer tasting float of 6 beers, if you don't know where to start! They have pretty good nachos and the cornbread is to die for! The place is gorgeous and the staff are knowledgable."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places in Newmarket Main Street and anything you order from this menu is a good call!  Recently went for appetizers and we ordered the Charcuterie board which was inexpensive and quite generous and delicious.  We also had their wine on tap!  Love this and great wine selection.  Their nachos are out of this world too.  The staff are all friendly and attentive.  I've never had a bad experience here and always come back."}
{"text":"Bumping this place up based on last nights experience.  We came back knowing that they now had the new crowd favourite Red Racer from Central City on tap.  My girlfriend loves that beer.  We each sampled a \"flight\" of four beers which were all unique and yummy. 
We then feasted on pulled pork nachos...with jalepenos and sriracha. Yummy.  Their jalepenos are particularly spicy and juicy. I then had a spicy burger with kale salad.  Service was good.  Food was good and price was decent.  Again...while the burger meat was steaming and delicious...I find I wanted a tomato or pickle or something else on my burger to balance out the meat, cheese and bacon.  
Anyways..up to four stars. Would like to come back."}
