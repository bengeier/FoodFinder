{"text":"I've been here once before and hated it so I avoided this place like the plague for years. A friend wanted to eat here today so  I figured that I should give this place a second chance....too bad I was disappointed again.   I had their $6.95 lunch special of Pad Thai and Ginger Beef that comes with the daily soup or mango salad and 2 mini spring rolls. The soup of the day was Lemongrass Chicken and pretty much tasted like sugar in hot lemonade. It was wayyy too sweet, but because I was soaked and cold from the rain, I finished the whole thing. The Pad Thai came promptly afterwards, but I was disappointed even more. The noodles were cold, too sweet (ketchup-y) and lacked any color at all. There were too many raw bean sprouts on top so that it was all I tasted. The whole thing was just bland. My friend and I liked the flavor of the beef but the texture with dry and overcooked, not tender like we expected it to be. The spring rolls were just edible but full of grease. I never finished my plate because I just couldn't take the flavors anymore.   The redeeming factor was the service. The waitress was super friendly and refilled our drinks promptly. +1 star...  7$ lunches are pretty typical in Toronto. Definitely go someone else next time. I won't be coming back and neither should you."}
{"text":"Their menu is pretty diverse and their appetizers are my favourite that I've tried so far. Must-trys are the Green Mango Salad (sweet slices of green mango topped with fish sauce) and the Calamari (fried to crispy perfection without being overly oily). For the entrees, I tried 2 different curry dishes (lamb and duck) and 2 noodle dishes (pad thai and glass noodles). Wasn't a big fan of the curry, I found it to be overly sweet with too much coconut sauce so it overpowered the meaty flavour. But i think in general I'm more of a Malaysian Curry lover than Thai anyways. But what won me over were their Pad Thai and the Pad Woon Sen dishes. They were sooo yummy and flavourful - i loved it. The waitstaff was super friendly but service was a bit on the slow side but I didn't mind too much since it was pretty packed.  Overall , it was good meal."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular Thai places to go. Their red curry is excellent. The Pad Thai is a bit too saucy, but it is tasty.  All around a good place to get some nice Thai food and it's not too expensive. Bonus to the fact that it's right on the subway line!"}
{"text":"I picked this restaurant because it looked nice from outside, We ordered shrimp curry, Tofu curry, Tam young soup and PaiThai. First the soup tasted just sour, nothing special. rest of the dishes were just so sweet and sugary. I ordered spicy curry but no taste at all except just sweet. The waitress was o.k, chatted very loud by the receptions. The curry had not that much sauce. A little bit disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has turned into one my favourite places to eat on the go.  My bf and I love it here!  Reasons why you should go:  1.  Excellent portions. 2.  Great service. 3.  Cheap liquor and beer. 4.  Lovely atmosphere.  Honestly, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We ordered from Real Thailand last night. There was some mixup with our order and it took two hours to arrive. We called the restaurant and they were unhelpful and rude.  The food is okay- but there are lots of okay Thai places in Toronto. For reasons of bad service we will not order from Real Thailand again."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai food! The veggie drunken noodles are delish and so is the veggie curry. I'm vegan and I unfortunately found out that the curry has fish sauce and the sauce is ready made so they can't make it without :("}
{"text":"I find the service to be extremely polite, quiet but polite and attentive. The decor is charmingly dated but the restaurant is clean and bright enough.  The wait times are good, and I've always enjoyed the food I've had there. It's a nice option for Thai in the area, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Pretty poor. Are you kidding me, 4 stars?? Their pad thai is much too saucy... I am horrified to think that it might be ketchup. And we had a green curry that was weirdly light on curry flavour but heavy on spicy.   Not at all worth your time or money."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting too much when we decided to dine here, after my picky dinner companion vetoed every Korean place on the block. She was looking for a meal containing chicken, she said and wasn't all that impressed with the paucity of options at Buk Chang Dong Soon Tofu. Real Thailand's menu, visibly adherent to the inside of the glass window, promised to deliver. So many different chicken dishes! Gotta love the bird....  Unfortunately, it was all terrible. Between her cashew chicken (sure didn't see any cashews in there..) and my chicken with broccoli and basil, we forced ourselves to down the plentiful portions of Real Thailand's \"chicken-y goodness.\" Let's not forget the rice paper wraps which tasted like cardboard. Gotta say, the broccoli was legitimately delicious, but after our long and hard search for chicken, we vowed never to come back here again!"}
{"text":"If you live in the Annex, this I where you should be ordering your Thai delivery from, it's the absolute best. They have tons of veggie selections, healthy options, great soups and starters and the prices are great. Plus, they deliver so quickly, sometimes I wonder how they make it that fast, and you don't have to order tons and tons of food to get it delivered in the first place."}
{"text":"Some of the very best Pad Thai you can find in the city, superior cold rolls, and a top notch red curry (chicken or vegetable).  Quick delivery in the Annex and great customer service."}
{"text":"Good service, food was really good but not spectacular. It's my go to take out spot but not as tasty as the sit down places I normally go to."}
{"text":"A conveniently located, surprising tasty little find. We took-out, but every thing was fresh. The pad woon sen was quite yummy, and the prices very affordable (approx 9$ a dish) Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Toronto I was more than a little disappointed in the smaller takeout thai experiences I was having.  Why is the pad thai so pink, I'd ask?  Oh, some places put ketchup in it, was the glib reply.  What?  Really?  Maybe I was a bit of a thai food snob, but I decided to just hold out for something better than to complain about the less than stellar options available.  Eventually someone convinced me to go to Real Thailand for their incredibly cheap lunch specials, most of which run between $5-$7 each.  For that kind of price I knew that I could afford to have a bad experience, so I went ahead and ordered the pad thai.  Your lunch comes with the choice of soup or mango salad, then the meal itself which comes with a spring roll.  The first trip hit the ball right out of the park, and thus I was converted.  If you're fussy about soup you may have to try and sweet talk your way into something better, the soup seems to be lemongrass chicken more than the far superior hot and sour soup.  If you go earlier the service will be a bit faster, but generally speaking you'll be eating in very short order, and with soup or salad to keep you busy it's no big sacrifice to have to wait a few more minutes.  Ice cream at the end is just another couple of dollars with options like coconut and mango ice cream.  I also recommend the red pork curry and the spicy tofu, although bear in mind that nearly anything with the word \"spicy\" in the title isn't going to really be spicy at all, I haven't tried yet but it might be worth a try to see if you can get it extra hot or something."}
{"text":"A great option for people craving thai food on a budget. Food here is very cheap compared to most fine dining restaurants. Ambience was ok but the food is great. I usually order the chicken pad Thai but the ginger beef is good too. Definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Slow service and mediocre food. The pad Thai was sweet, with no spice. I couldn't finish it. Even the green tea was weak. There are lots of other good restaurants in the neighbourhood. Try one of them."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner with friends from Ottawa expecting the place to be a standard Thai restaurant. By that, we expected the food to be flavourful, fresher than Thai Express, but nothing wow.   What was pleasantly surprising was the decor inside. It was a lot nicer than we expected, so we decided to pass on the outside patio and just sit in.   The menu is actually quite extensive so you can try a lot of things. We got the crab fried rice, a beef dish, and a lamb dish. The portions were fair (the pictures on the menu actually make the dishes seem smaller than they are). The sauces were a bit overwhelming, and the rice didn't really have a solid taste, though they did throw in a good amount of crab meat including a claw. Overall tasty food, but as expect, not wow.  Service is solid and it's pretty cheap, but in the Annex, it wouldn't be harder to get a more satisfying meal for the same price.  As a point of reference for people from Ottawa, it's comparable to the Green Papaya restaurants in Ottawa, with nicer seating."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Big menu with lots of diverse options.   It kind of feels like how it might feel if you were on a cruise or at a resort. The decor is a little dated but it's clean and doesn't feel sad. The staff are very polite but also very quiet and stay mostly out of the way. The drinks are cheap.   But mostly, man, the food. So good. Give this place a chance. Especially for lunch."}
{"text":"This restaurant has amazing deals for lunch time. I have ordered Vegetarian Pad Thai Combo which came with a side of soup or mango salad + 2 spring rolls, which was $5. The food was good for the price, but the pad thai tasted like it was made with ketchup and had no peanuts on top, which I have come to expect. The mango salad was quite good but toward the end of it I felt this weird aftertaste forming in my mouth. Spring rolls are quite good, nice balance of flavors. The restaurant is quite spacious with traditional style decor, and has a decent lunch time crowd. Amazing deal, but the pad thai was not good enough for me to come back again."}
{"text":"We do not know, as something wasn't quite pleasant at this place, probably the server and of course meh, the food as well. Seemed as it was made sloppy, I mean chef didn't put her/his heart into the food, but of course I understand that this is like a factory work - meal after meal...anyway, I hope you get our point.  Friend was visiting and we wanted her to try Pad Thai. We started with spring rolls. Good, but nothing exciting. Followed Pad Thai, so-so and and vegetables with tofu with rice on the side. The gravy where all those veggies were soaked in wasn't exciting.  Food came relatively fast, but didn't taste much. We will not be going there.  Nothing much."}
{"text":"FAVE THAI RESTAURANT!  I come here so much, sometimes twice a week, that it's almost a little embarrassing. My favourite dish is the radnar talay which I pretty much order 8 out of 10 times while I am there. I find Real Thai to have higher quality food than most other Thai places and the ambience and service is great! I have loved every dish they made, although I agree with the pad thai being a little too saucy.   Love it, love it, love it!"}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant buffet for the first time on the weekend and it was absolutely delcious!  I will definitely be a return customer!"}
{"text":"The food here is quite good.  A particular favourite of mine is their Panang Nuer, a nice rich beef curry with lots of peanuts.  Their appetizer platter is a very nice dish to start with.  The restaurant is nice and quiet, spacious and not too busy.  Service is also quite good."}
{"text":"The new location is right across from Honest Ed's, and it's much bigger than it used to be. Family friendly, wheelchair friendly, even date friendly.  The food is consistently good, prices are reasonable, and the service is just fine.  The only reason why this restaurant gets 4/5 stars is because they badly need an interior designer to help update their look. Honestly, it's like eating in a board room. This new location has the same shrine and art as their old location, but it kept none of its former charm. Every time I eat here, there are more take-out than eat-in customers, and I wish it wasn't so. With the right music and design, this place would be filled with customers again for sure."}
{"text":"From the looks of the decor, it seems quite legit. However, the food is just not up to snuff.  My fried rice had dried shrimp in it, which has an extremely strong seafood smell. On top of that, the rice was clearly not freshly fried, given that it can be stuffed into a shape of the bowl. The chicken was decent on the side, but the combination of hot and cold vegetables in the same dish is quite odd.   The food could have been a lot better. I have an odd feeling that they do not prepare everything fresh and that's the one killer for me."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends on  a week day. Was going to order from the regular menu but then we saw some lunch sets that comes with soup and spring roll so we tried that out.   Food: We ordered the House Pad Thai, Street Pad Thai and Basil chicken. Street Pad Thai was my favourite, the house Pad Thai was a little bit on the sour side but it was still really good. It was really nothing fancy but I think food was authentic.  Service: Staff was friendly and was able to answer our questions promptly.  Cleanliness: I felt the place looked clean. Washrooms were clean.   Decor: Simple decor, again nothing fancy at all  Cost: Prices seem very reasonable. I've never tried their buffet but would like to give it a try."}
{"text":"Et bien c'est pas mal du tout ! Cela faisait des lustres que nous passions à côté de ce restaurant qui ne cherche pas à se faire remarquer outre mesure. Pourtant, c'est pas mal du tout. Portions généreuses, du goût, parfaitement assaisonné et un service impeccable."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food in Toronto, Quality is very good, good portion size, fresh tasting and very flavorful.   Price - reasonable price for the quality and portion you are getting.  Service - excellent, very attentive. The food came out at a reasonable time.  Overall - highly recommend this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Always great Thai food, and great customer service!! The Lunch special is well worth the money too, for a three piece tasty meal between $6-$10!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  Fast service, good (but not great) food, under $10 for a sit down meal with soup/salad plus entree."}
{"text":"We were hoping to get real Thai food by going to real Thai restaurant. Alas, the food was below mediocre: ketchupy pad Thai and sugary mango chicken that required a waterfall to flush the taste.  Definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Update July 2017 *So I visited the place again, they do Not have the buffet anymore. The menu food price was bit expensive and food tasted just okay. Probably cannot recommend this place anymore unless you are a big group and need lot of space. They have huge seating area unlike the other restaurants nearby.  previous review below  My second time here. Went today sunday for the lunch buffet. Price was $13 (before taxes and tips) which is reasonable and the food taste quite decent as well.. The space inside is quite spacious which I like. It seems clean... The only downside is the lack of food choices compared to a place like mandarin.. But that's probably why their prices are much more competitive.  Anyways all in all good for a Thai /Asian style food."}
{"text":"Food was good however service was horrible. Interior is bland and dark. Only plus is that the food is cheap and quick."}
{"text":"I've always been curious about this place and one day my friends and I decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad I did because this is my new spot whenever I'm in the area!  My friends and I all got different kinds of curry and they were all delicious!  But my absolute favourite from our meal is one of the apps we got the side. It was #10, Tofu Tod. I'm a big deep fried tofu lover, that's why I ordered it in particular. However, as much as I loved tofu, I could not get enough of the taro balls! It may not be a favourite for some, but definitely a favourite for me! It also came with cucumber on the side which was a refreshing to have while eating the taro, tofu and curry.  Aside from the food, the servers were so friendly! We came pretty late and lost track of time and ended up staying past closing time. We felt so bad because we realized that they were actually waiting for us to leave so they can close up for the night. But as we paid for our bill and were leaving they didn't seem bothered by it at all. They seemed genuinely happy we had a great time at their restaurant."}
{"text":"The weekend lunch buffet is okay. Nothing really stands out. Everything was mildly spiced but you can ask the server for hot chilis if you want it spicier. Service is great and your water glass is never empty. Overall a satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Second visit, and the overall experience was just great.  I guess they could hire one more waiter/waitress, as the place got kinda busy with only one waiter."}
{"text":"Decent Thai food in \"the hood\".   Ordered the green mango salad, pad Thai and green chicken curry the first time I went. Food came quickly, and tasted good. That was enough for me to book a table for a casual birthday party.  I first have to say they are really good with people with allergies. Extra point for that. One person in my group was allergic to peanuts, another to ginger and coconut. (I know, Thai was a poor choice!) They were really respectful and provided dishes that did not trigger anyone.  This time I had the pad sen woo, which was really tasty. Downside, my friend ordered a dish, with a side of rice noodles, only to find the dish already had noodles in it! That should have been mentioned. Talk about noodle overload!  Everyone enjoyed their food, the prices aren't high, and if you want some wine it's not expensive.   Good neighbourhood Thai place when you don't feel like cooking. I'll be back."}
{"text":"i used to work in the area and one of my fav things was \"working lunches\" we'd order from real thailand for some awesome for lunch specials. they offer them to take-out or dine-in. the portions are large and each meal comes with an assortment of items.   food takes a while to prepare though, so i suggest ordering well in advance or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Passed by this place a few times before and finally decided to try this place today.  Fairly big place, plenty of seats and doesn't seem that busy surprisingly.  I brought 4 out of town guests to this restaurant after hearing about all the great things about it.  I ordered the \"Pad Woon Sen\" and was pretty impressed and satisfied. Great food all around, all my guests were happy with that they ordered, I remember everyone having their first bite and saying 'wow, its pretty good!'  Will definitely be back. A great selection of authentic Thai food!"}
{"text":"Top top thai resto. Great food and service. Cheap. A wonder it's as empty as it generally is. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Spring rolls were tasty, house pad-thai was okay, quite watery."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today with a friend.  The lunch specials are reasonably priced - $9 for pad thai, a meat or fish side, spring rolls and soup or salad.  The spring rolls were decent but cold in the middle.  The soup was lukewarm.  The pad thai was bland and the tofu was rubbery.  I had the fish as my side and it was actually pretty tasty.  There are much better options in the area."}
{"text":"I came in for dinner. As I walked in - I was shocked to see how HUGE this place is on the inside. The decor isn't the best. It's very 'buffet restaurant' - esque (which it is during lunch). I order the calamari as an appetizer, green curry (chicken) and my friend ordered the chicken fried rice.  Calamari - eh, I've had better. Green Curry - Small portion, taste was okay. Fried Rice - HUGE serving, more on the bland side.  Maybe I missed it but I didn't see many Thai curry options on the menu? There are other Thai food options that are more affordable and tasty. On the plus side - the service is great!"}
{"text":"They've moved on a bit west: 570 Bloor Street W http://www.yelp.ca/biz/real-thailand-restaurant-toronto-2   All else is the same! Still my favourite summer/fresh cold rolls if we're talking about purchasing."}
{"text":"I stopped in after class one night looking to take away some pad Thai. It was just ok. It came with chicken and shrimp and although I asked for it to be extra spicy, it really wasn't spicy at all. The service was relatively quick and moderately friendly, but the value wasn't there.  Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"During my time at university when I lived in the Annex, this was my go to Thai place.  First off, they used to have an epic lunch special.  I don't know if they still do this, as I haven't walked by during the day in quite some time but it was very cost effective and delish.  I've been a couple of times this year and the food is still as good as it was back in 2006.  Any restaurant that has been around in the Annex 5 years or longer is usually pretty good.  The only problem I had last time was that we waited a long time for service.  It actually got to a point where my friend and I were getting kind of ticked off.  This was a first offence - they lost one star."}
{"text":"If you can go for the lunch special, do it, because it's a great price. If you can't, still go, the food is great, the service is relatively quick, the prices are average or during the lunch special they are good, and it's right downtown. It's a good, solid, reliable place when you're in the mood for Thai or don't know what you want."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think I could eat their red curry forever.  However, I think I need to do some more research before writing a lengthy review - maybe eight or nine trips.  This week."}
{"text":"My friend and I ended up at Real Thailand after our fiasco at Boulevard Café (see previous review).  It was a Friday night and it was after 8, so we figured we wouldn't likely be able to get into any other semi-upscale places.  At this point, we were both very hungry and just wanted some food in our bellies before heading over to Lee's Palace for the evening.  When we got up to Bloor, this was the first place we saw.  I wasn't super stoked about the idea of Thai food (I love Thai, but I had been anticipating South American cuisine all day), but went for it anyways.  I was a quick convert when I saw the price point on their cocktails - 2 and 3 ounces for $5.50 and $6.50!  That is a rare find in Toronto, or so has been my experience.  I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea, and was very happy with it (so happy I ordered another before the meal was through).  And I didn't see the pre-made mix on the bar, but I can't say 100%.  The restaurant decor was pretty nice, nicer than the typical Thai restaurants I've been to in the past where it's just tables and chairs.  There was some artwork and some attempts had clearly been made to enhance the atmosphere.  The service was decent - not great, not bad.    As for our meals, I ordered the Pad Woon Sen (stir-fried glass noodle with chicken, shrimps, egg and onion for $8.95).  I tend to go for Pad Si Ew, but decided to mix it up a bit.  And I was glad I did, because it was really tasty!  I don't think I've ever had glass noodles before...they're so tiny...that might have been the basis of their appeal for me.  My friend ordered mixed vegetables and rice, and although she liked it found that there wasn't quite the variety she had hoped for.    Definitely not the best Thai food I've had (I did grow up in Richmond Hill after all), but very good value and great for a quick meal if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Other reviews are correct. The Pad Thai is a little on the sweet side and their sauce does taste like it has a ketchup base.   However, this won't stop me from going back.  I'll just try something different next time.  Both the speed of service and the prices reflect a nearly perfect place for lunch.  I could see myself ordering take-out for dinner, but not sitting down for a special meal.   My water was refilled multiple times and the person serving me was pleasant.  The portion was more than I could eat. The $11 (with drink) lunch combo included 2 spring rolls, shrimp stir fry, pad thai and oranges. Enough for 2 meals!  I'll go back here for lunch without hesitation."}
{"text":"great food. staff was very pleasant. outdoor seating and people watching was great."}
{"text":"Given my experience at KSR, Pai, and Sukho, I wouldn't exactly call this \"authentic\" Thai. However, it's good, comforting food with decently large portion sizes that is not particularly expensive, is made fresh, and can be delivered to my apartment - all three of which are bonuses.   Location and Size: I haven't as yet been to the new location, though I've seen its exterior. As such, I can't really comment on this facet of the restaurant. I don't usually eat in anyway - I typically order deliver.  Staff: The staff are mostly friendly, though they aren't overly generous; if you're not sure if you made an error or they did, for example, they won't be particularly quick to fix it. Though that's somewhat understandable, some places would go out of their way to help you. They are, however, usually quite accommodating in terms of specifications - we always order extra egg, for example, and though they charge us extra, they definitely make sure it's included, and tailor it to the way we like it prepared (i.e., shredded). I like that they inquire about cutlery, and provide both chopsticks and forks when asked! The delivery guys are very nice.   Prices: Not very expensive! They're willing to deliver one main and an appetizer, which is nice.  Food: Consistently good, though not necessarily authentic. Their house pad thai is made with ketchup, which lends it a nice kind of sweetness, but is of course not in alignment with Thai-ness, really. Rather hypocritically and a little guiltily, we always order this anyway, because it's a bit craving-inducing. Stacked with vegetables and tofu (should you request those), it also comes with shrimps and chicken; all in all, peanuts and bean sprouts included, it's nicely balanced. I haven't had much else from them - I've had their street pad thai as well, which I wasn't able to too-thoroughly differentiate from the house pad thai, though it was only made with tamarind. Like the fact that they also deliver juices (e.g., mango juice).   Additional Notes:  1) Make sure you always point out customizations to your order - they won't remember them, even if they remember you!"}
{"text":"Real Thailand has totally won me over. That Spicy Eggplant...whooweee, let me tell you. It is so delicious. You have to try it! I actually love the vegetarian dishes from RT. They're packed with veggies, filled with flavour, and just all around yummy. The food here is also very reasonably priced and the staff is always friendly. You really must give them a try if you're in the Annex and feeling like Thai."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The waiter was very attentive and refilled my drink quickly. The food arrived quickly.   The food itself is just average. Not the best Thai food that I've had, nor the most authentic. The massaman curry lamb seemed a bit too sweet and thick. The lamb was tender and well cooked however. The spring rolls were crisp and tasty and I did enjoy those. The coconut rice was not as coconutty as I am used to.   The atmosphere is no frills but nice and clean. There is a large bar area. Lots of seating and good for a big group.   If you are in the neighbourhood and craving Thai then may be worth checking out. I would not go out of the way to come here otherwise."}
{"text":"This is one of the few authentic Thai restaurants . Their Pad Thai is not the ketchup based thing you find elsewhere . Try the platter , the beef dishes , the deep fried snapper [ prepared several ways ] and the crab fried rice."}
{"text":"I had heard that there was a great Thai place in the Annex but could not recall rhe actual name  Grab a  $7 lunch special with soup or Mango salad  Dig in. enjoy. Live the thai life  I had the Beef basil and was wowed with 2 crispy spring rolls  Fresh, tasty, super fast service.  Luv this!"}
{"text":"I eat here wayyyyyy too much.  They deliver as well, so it's rare we eat in the actual restaurant, but we're so close that they delivery is cheap and fast, and everything arrives hot.  Like HOT. Too hot to eat right away. Awesome.  The food here is fantastic, and the prices are great.   My favorites:  1)Chicken Panang - really creamy, and the peanut flavor is fantastic. The chicken is always good quality and tasty as shit.  2)Basil Chicken - spicy but not mouth-burning. Chicken is tasty, veggies are cooked perfectly, and fresh is all get out.  3)Chicken Fried Rice - normally I wouldn't add this but it's so good here I have to mention it. Basil-infused fried Thai rice at its best  4)Chicken Pad Thai - I don't like shrimp so I ask for their pad thai with JUST chicken, and they have never screwed that up. I think this is the best Pad Thai in the city, next to Queen Mother, tho I must admit I'm no expert.   Great place, friendly service, great delivery, awesome food, super cheap.  Go."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every now and then for a few years now, and the food is always authentic and very delicious.   Personally, I'd rather come for lunch since the prices are great, and the food is pretty much the same but dinner has also been exceptional if you can't work with the timings.   Rice is an extra $1.50 per bowl and that's a bit of a downer but I'm not big on rice, anyway. I'm usually okay with just half a bowl.   The service is just okay, so they lose half a star being a little less attentive, but they do an adequate job, and I couldn't care less about the service when this is the best Thai option in the Annex.   I heartily recommend the:  -Yum Mamuang (Green Mango Salad, $7.95). It comes with an assortment of ingredients, spices and grilled chicken. If you're a vegetarian you might want to let the servers know ahead of time, because I would have never expected Chicken in my Green Mango Salad, but I loved it.   -Kai Kraphao (Basil Chicken, $8.95). It's rich, a little coconut-y, and pretty spicy.   -Pad Makheur (Basil Eggplant, $8.95). I adore eggplant. I love it's juicy sweetness when cooked with spices, chilis and other vegetables, so it very easily wins me over everytime.   You *have* to try the lunch specials at least once, though."}
{"text":"I went in for a lunch buffet and it was good! The food was cooked fresh and had a good variety like rice, vermicelli, chicken, pork, salad, fruits, and soup.  Thai food is often spicy and I can't handle it, but interestingly this place the dishes are not spicy except a select few. Whether intentional or not, the mixed vegetables, rice, and spring rolls really reminded me of Chinese food.  The interior decor has a brown colour theme and pictures of people, life, and highlights in Thailand. Overall I'd say it the restaurant is good value and a comfortable place to dine."}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to live in the Annex and would get takeout there pretty much every-other day. The food is delicious and the staff could not be any friendlier. Now that I live out of the area I am still able to get delivery and even that is amazing, and there's only a 20 dollar minimum. It's quick, accurate and friendly. Definitely the best Thai food in the city."}
{"text":"Best pad thai I have ever had!   While wondering the streets shopping on a hot summer day in the downtown Toronto, me and my friends were trying to find something to eat. Which of course you would think would be easy considering that downtown Toronto offers some of the most diverse food in the world.   After walking from Queen St to Yonge St to Bloor and finally Spadina we finally found a place we all agreed upon. I'm really glad that it took us that long to find it b/c this place was like a diamond in the rough.   On the outside there is a little patio section where you could eat but considering the heat outside we wanted the nice AC to enjoy our dinner. On the inside it was very well decorated with statues, pictures and all the things you would find in Thailand. I'm only guessing here b/c I haven't been to Thailand yet!   There was a large variety of items on the menu that was decently priced, but considering this was my first time here I already made up my mind to try the pad thai. I started off first with the calamari and they were very well done, not oily like some places and the sauce that they use to dip it in was delicious and made the calamari that much better. As for the pad thai, I absolutely made the right choice at that time, the pad thai was the best I've ever had! I added a little more spice than normal and it was superb!   Now the only reason I haven't given this place 5 stars yet is b/c I havent tried all of the food yet. I do plan on coming back most likely in the summer time to try the rest of the menu. So this is only a partial review!   Items to definitely get:   - seafood pad thai  - calamari"}
{"text":"Came in with two friends. First visit to this restaurant after they moved from Bloor Spadina location. Saw their sign for weekend lunch buffet, so decided to give it a try as I never had a Thai buffet before. Kinda a bit underwhelmed by the food. Not sure if it is because of the snow storm, not many people when we got here. Red Thai beef curry seemed a bit watered down. The Pad Thai was so so. Drunken noodles was better. Server attentive, refilling the water before it ever got a chance to empty."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and very big place. Washrooms are on the same level for lazy peeps like me that don't wanna go downstairs.   Food: some hits and some misses.   Thai ice tea: don't order. It tasted like tetley, sugar, and milk. Not good.  Street pad Thai: this was pretty good. They have a house pad Thai that uses ketchup and some tamarind sauce and the street pad Thai uses only  tamarind sauce. This was good, not Pi good, but good for $11.50. Though, there wasn't a lot of shrimp in the dish, the meal was plentiful. I had leftovers and it tasted good the next day!   Eggplant and rice: very good! Eggplant was cooked right.   Fresh spring rolls: really liked this. A lot of ingredients and very filling!  If you want filling meal at a good price, come to this place, but don't expect Pi or khao San road quality. I think they have a lot of potential though!"}
{"text":"The food here is very tasty. I had noodles & spring rolls. The meal for two people (dinner) came to less than $35. We were both more than full.  The service was average. The restaurant itself doesn't look very fancy. From the outside, I thought it was a bar."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai in Toronto! Great mango salad, rich flavorful curries. *New favorite dish: spicy beef salad**"}
{"text":"This is a good option for Thai near the Spadina subway station on Bloor.  The service is not the best, but it is not quite terrible either.  Mostly just a case of not enough people waiting on too many customers.  For the money, the place is a great deal. I had green curry chicken with rice. It came with hot n sour soup and two small egg rolls for 7.85$ after tax. The food was hot and tasty. Even after tip, I paid McDonald's prices for much better food in a nice environment.  Don't come here expecting a 25$ meal for lunch. However, for less than 10$, the food is quite good."}
{"text":"Sample of 100 meals:  MUST TRY:  1) Kang Massaman Lamb  2) Special Appetizer Platter (2 shrimp cakes, 2 chicken satay, 3 cold rolls, calamari)  RECOMMENDED:  Nuer Yang / Grilled Beef  Cashew Nut Chicken. [Another reviewer said there were no cashews.. I've had this over 50 times and there are always lots of cashews]  Radnar Talay (seafood + rice noodles)  Pad Woon Sen (glass noodles)  +Coconut rice side order  OK:  Green Curry  Pad Thai *** I encourage you to order something else. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as good as the other noodle dishes   I've been coming here for 15 years. The food is very consistent at dinner time, and you will always be full after a meal here. Yes, the lunch special is a good deal, but the dinner options are definitely better. (I have yet to try the lunch buffet, but it sounds more promising than the old lunch specials)  Service is attentive and friendly.  Real Thailand is excellent for the price point. It's good for group reservations, as they have a large seating area.  BONUS: It's perfect for take out / delivery, especially for a group where you can share different dishes.  Note that the review has been updated for the new location. It's the exact same quality food and service."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 10+ years. The food is very consistent at dinner time, and you will always be full after a meal here. Yes, the lunch is a good deal, but the dinner options are definitely better.  Recommendations:  1) Kang Massaman Lamb (excellent thick dark curry)  2) Cashew Nut Chicken. Someone else said there were no cashews.. I've had this over 50 times and it has always come with lots of cashews  3) Pad Woon Sen (glass noodles)  4) Radnar Talay (seafood + rice noodles)  5) Grilled Beef  Also, order a Coconut rice with your meal  Real Thailand is excellent for the price point. It's pretty good for group reservations, as they have a quite a large seating area.  Note: I find that the pad thai is only mediocre and overrated by others. Don't judge them on the pad thai alone. Green curry chicken is just average."}
{"text":"Went for a late dinner, it was fairly quiet when I was there.  The food was decent and the dishes were served reasonably quickly.  The service was reasonable, but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I've gotten this as take out a few times because it's close by and I would definitely recommend it. I'm pretty boring when ordering Thai food because I tend to always go with the traditional Pad Thai, but you can't go wrong getting it from this place. Serving portion is large and it is very flavourful. Speedy delivery and wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"This is an updated review after trying the new $12.95 lunch buffet. I'm sad to say that the quality has drastically gone down hill. The previous $7.95 lunch special was cheap, quick, and tasty. The new buffet is way too expensive for what you get, and the mass produced food just doesn't cut it. I have been going to this restaurant for 10 years and this was the worst meal I've had here. Nothing tasted as it usually does, especially the pad Thai, which basically tasted like a bottle of weird ketchup. I hope they go back to the old special! This is way too expensive and there is probably so much food wasted."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Toronto. Food is reasonably price and food is consistently delicious. Favourite meals 67 and 75 (I can't spell the dishes bit us a lamb dish and yellow curry with shrimp. Yum!"}
{"text":"Steady favourite with great pad Thai, curries and mango salad. They have been in the neighbourhood for a couple decades and their menu and flavours haven't faltered. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Really good food. Way too many veggies in the spicy basil fried rice that I had that was spicy at all.  The coconut soup was outstanding. And they start you with a delicious Mango Salad and 2 spring rolls that I think were vegetarian."}
{"text":"Decent dishes (although not spicy/hot enough to me), nice environment, convenient to get to. Good service. Like this one."}
{"text":"We had the Duck Curry and Water Spinach (morning glory) dishes. I found it interesting how they added spice to a Chinese veggie dish (turned out to be delish). Also never had curry with Duck. Also turned out to be delicious. Good service, food came quickly. Love it : D  Lol @ the people that just get pad thai... try out their thai curry dishes instead of going with the generic thai noodles dish."}
{"text":"Great thai food for great prices! I loved the chicken soup, and I'm not even a fan of chicken. I can't wait to go there and try different things - but starting with the amazing chicken soup.   If you choose seafood, the prices may be a little higher, but they're still ok.  It has many options of teas (like green, jasmine, etc) but they charge 1.50 per jar.   Some dishes don't  have steamed rice, and you may have to add your choice of rice (steamed, coconut) for 1.50 or something like that .    Me and my husband had a seafood dinner, with rice, soup and tea for $25, including tax and tip"}
{"text":"I have never tried anything like this place's Goong Oap. The shrimp can be tough sometimes but the flavour of the soup is amazing. I also LOVE their calamari. Best seasoning I have ever had on calamari. I literally have gone to this place several times solely based on a craving for either the calamari or the Goong Oap."}
{"text":"This is a pretty average Thai food restaurant, reasonable food and not too high prices.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you're in the area and need to feed then this will fill your belly for about $12.  The taste had the standard mass-produced taste and quality known across North America that is neither bad nor good.  I managed to get in and out in record time (I eat fast and I ordered a simple dish), so that's a selling point for my schedule, but I fear for my stomach tomorrow morning.   Oddly, though the place is called \"Real Thailand\" the only Thai drinks they have are two kinds of beer.  Lame.  In L.A. my favorite Thai place has this Thai-style rice wine that I prefer even to the Japanese variety.  Nothing here like that here...or any Thai soda.  It's not real.  It's just a nothing-special cookie-cutter Thai restaurant that serves a purpose...and that purpose is not to be real Thailand."}
{"text":"My disclaimer for this review:  My experience with this restaurant is solely based on takeout experiences.   While this restaurant is easy walk by and has a somewhat forgettable interior, the food is pretty darn tasty. Alright, so their pad thai is an odd (glowing?) orange colour, but damn is it ever tasty! I would particularly recommend their lunch deals, which allow you to pair a pad thai with a basil shrimp or other side dish.   You'll find that the food is quite tasty, but not necessarily made with the highest quality of ingredients (deep fried spring rolls!) Some of their dishes have quite a lot of oil, so if you have a sensitive stomach I would be careful in my choice of dishes.   Quite frankly, I realize my review doesn't sound very positive, but god... this food tastes so good. I have had a really hard time finding decent pad thai in this city, and while this place won't reach my top 5, it's certainly tasty enough to get a thumbs up for those who need a pad thai fix while not breaking the bank."}
{"text":"1st visit. The interior is very nice, authentic decor, the back portion however could use some extra light. The waiters were attentive and the food was prepared quite quick. I ordered the curry tofu vegetable plate (which was supposed to be spicy) but it lacked any spice at all. Disappointing food experience as I enjoy tofu much more with some sort of good tasting spice or sauce, but it was just covered in spice less curry. Regardless, the tofu and vegetables were tasty. Good overall visit."}
{"text":"Real Thailand is brightly lit with a large, two tiered open dining room. The service is super friendly and the menu large and affordable. The crispy fried tofu came with an even ratio of tasty fried taro slices and an appetizing dip of spicy fish sauce and julienned cucumber. The seafood soup was hearty, swimming with mussels, thick slices of fish, and squid rings in a flavourful broth.  During our visit, despite an unfortunate incident with a homeless person coming in and harassing the servers by breaking glasses and attacking them with a chair, the servers silently cleaned up the mess and maintained a friendly demeanor.  I have more than a handful of favourite Thai restaurants (and many more on my to try list), but despite not making it onto my top five, Real Thailand was none too shabby."}
{"text":"i am surprised by the reviews of this place. i had the pad thai, and it was far too sweet and i think they simply used way too much ketchup in their recipe. that they use ketchup is surprising, and i may be wrong, but it sure tasted like my pad thai had been doused in ketchup. i have never had such bad pad thai. usually it's at least tolerable enough to finish -- this was not.  i should've been suspicious. any restaurant that prominently displays that they won some restaurant award for best thai food BACK IN 2001 should make me wonder what has happened since then."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants. Huge menu, there are a ton of delicious things to choose from. Also the restaurant is very big, so there's no waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Thai food ? Authenticity? Authentic ingredients? YES YES YES........FINALLY A RESTAURANT THAT UNDERSTANDS SPICY .........if that's what your looking for ? Or are you a candy sweet food eater? They will make your food mild if you request it ? Bumped into this restaurant by accident yesterday while my wife and I were visiting Toronto Canada area Aug 6-9, 2016. This is the kind of restaurant you will find in NYC or Elmhurst Queens NY.  Check them out"}
{"text":"Not the best food. Rice was stale, the Thai cure I ordered was meh. It's my own fault though, when you see a restaurant that's completely empty at lunch time, you should know something is up"}
{"text":"This is a decent Thai place on Bloor. Came here with the family and some friends and we got seated pretty fast. The food was good- we had a whole snapper and crispy beef which I really liked and other noodles, veggie and rice dishes. Our guests had a good time as well. Overall pretty good!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the old location and was really looking forward to some Pad Thai, but the take out we got tonight was appalling. I could have made better at home.  2 whole shrimp! Over cooked at that. The chicken was dry and there was no sauce or heat to speak of. I'm angry we paid for it and I'm angry I was hungry enough to finish it.  Obviously, this was the last time we'll be going here. There's so much better Thai in the city, don't waste your time going here."}
{"text":"I got take-out because this restaurant was only blocks from my hotel. The prices were very affordable. The staff were very gracious & efficient. All of the food was delicious. I definitely recommend it if you are in the area and looking for genuine Thai cuisine. Good for dressy or casual."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Real Thailand for years, originally at the location near Spadina and their new location just west of Bathurst. But tonight we found ourselves really disappointed by the quality of the food. In the past we always found the dishes delicious and well worth the price. Tonight however we found ourselves unable to justify paying for the food at all. What we were served were dishes that lacked any kind of depth of flavour. As anyone who enjoys Thai food knows, the food is about depth of flavour. The dishes we ordered tonight tasted sadly like the food one expects from a fast food kiosk in a mall. Everything tasted the same without any difference or delicacy in flavour. The overpowering taste was sugar, like we were eating food drenched in a store bought sauce. Sadly, it is sad to see this neighbourhood institution serving food that does not measure up to what ate there in the past."}
{"text":"We checked Real Thailand out tonight.    appetizer: -Started out with spring rolls (2).  They were okay. -Hubby had tom yum gai (chicken) soup.  He found it to be on the salty side.  mains:  -The Pad Woon Sen / Fried Thai Noodle Dish was ordered without egg, chicken or shrimp.  The waiter suggested \"with vegetables. then?\"  I happily agreed. It also came with tofu, but I wasn't keen on the firm tofu and its deep-fried coating.  I found this dish to be flavourful, a nice accompaniment to some plain rice. -Also ordered was the fried eggplant dish.  It was nice, and I was worried that it would be too spicy -- but if anything, it was mild.  too mild?  I almost requested some hot sauce or some fresh hot chili peppers. -Chicken and veggie noodle dish.  Feedback was that it had the right amount of heat.  We left feeling quite full.  We decided against bringing anything home, so I pecked and pecked at what was still on the plates.  I felt too full for dessert.  ~~~ Service: -we were seated immediately, and water was promptly served; -this place was seriously well staffed tonight.  there were always ppl around keeping an eye on refilling our water, we felt attended to; -background music is Thai.  All servers were communicating in Thai with each other.  Nice Thai decor.  You'll notice the photo of a regal king.  I think the photo may be of King Chulalongkorn (1853-1910).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chulalongkorn   ~~ Zoe's fave item(s): Pad Woon Sen / the glass noodle dish made with veggies instead of egg/chicken/shrimp.  Skip its tofu, unless you're into the coated, deep-friend, and firm version.  I'd order it again w/ a side of plain rice.    I would absolutely go again.  Esp. when I next have a hankering for Thai food!"}
