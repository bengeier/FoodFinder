{"text":"Paid $85 for a Deep Cleansing Facial which was supposed to take 1 1/2 hours, let me tell you what I received:     The esthetician spent 20 mins looking for product she needed to even start the facial while I lay there in silence (isn't that supposed to be ready before you get there??).  There was no music to drown out the traffic noise from the street, not very relaxing, when she finally did find the creams and brushes she put me under the steamer for another 20 mins so 40 mins have passed and she's hardly touched me.  She did maybe 15 mins of extracting which I wanted more but she said that my face was too red in some areas.  I've had facial in the past and I always got a neck and shoulder massage towards the end but NOT at Bliss Vi!   I have given myself better facials at home.  I can't believe I spent $85 for a facial when I can go a couple of blocks down the street and spend half the $ and get a way better facial.  Needless to say I will not be going back, maybe the mani/pedi's are better??  But not willing to take the chance."}
{"text":"i dont doubt that Bliss Vi Nails and Spa has a comfortable environment to relax in. However, apart from that the service is bad. they do not know how to do nails at all. Let me give you an example,   i walked in one day for a manicure because it looks very professional and relaxing (exactly what i was looking for at that time).  At that time, i had gel nails on my fingers and was looking to take them off and just clean up my nails. Here goes it: they put some random woodpiece inbetween my real nails and gel nails and tried to flick it off, it hurt me so much but i didnt complained as much as i should have. most importantly, they did such a crappy job with my manicure i had to go to another place for a touch up.   long story cut short, i would never go back there again."}
{"text":"I've been to Bliss Vi Spa a few times since it's grand opening already! Beautifully decorated, gorgeous interior! Exceptional service!  The esthetician's are friendly and professional! I have reccomended a few friends, and they can say the same!"}
