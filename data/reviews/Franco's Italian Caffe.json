{"text":"Wanted a special dinner for my girlfriend and I while visiting family in Arizona and I was very impressed.  Prosciutto and Melon was a delicious start then on to the Pasta Herbe Aromatic (cant remember how to spell it) which is some of the best pasta I've ever had...and I've been to Italy twice!...the fish special was Seabass, which I could tell was really great quality, fresh, and authentic.  For dessert the cheesecake was out of this world. Best part, Franco himself was there making sure all the tables were enjoying themselves. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food, accommodated us without reservation. Leea was charming and knowledgeable. I will be back, treat yourself!"}
{"text":"The best pasta in Arizona. Being from the East coast, I found it extremely hard to find any edible pasta in Arizona- but Franco's is it. Not only is the food amazing, but Franco is there to greet you and see you leave. He gave a free glass of champagne, and antipasto appetizer to start the evening. I ordered the penne shrimp as an entree and it was absolutely amazing. Shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sauce was fantastic. As we stood up to leave, Franco came running over and asked us why we didn't order dessert. After we stated we were full, he told us \"absolutely not, sit back down. You have to try my dessert\" and boy he was right. He gave us free slices of flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. It was just as amazing as the customer service and the love Franco has for his business and his guests. We will absolutely be coming back whenever we are craving pasta, and I will never skip Franco's dessert again! Call days in advance for a reservation- they fill up quickly."}
{"text":"This restaurant is incredible. Mr. Franco personally sees to each table ensuring the perfect dining experience. The atmosphere is charming and romantic with a nice window, dim lights, and a quaint dining area. Make sure to make a reservation for the weekend! The food was AMAZING. From the bruschetta to the steak to the flour less chocolate cake, I cannot say enough good things. The steak was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. The chocolate cake was to die for! Living in Arizona, good Italian food is hard to come by, and Franco's is a home-run. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Worse service I ever had in my life. From making the reservation they were rude and inconsiderate. The dinner wasn't much better. Overall terrible experience. Food was not bad though"}
{"text":"This is the best Caffe that I have ever been to ever...  1. The best Italian food that I have had hands down no question. 2. The owner even though it was a full night found us a table and even gave us a free Antipasta.  3. If you have any question on going here don't just do it. You will not find a more down to earth staff and owner anywhere in Old Town."}
{"text":"Make a reservation and dine at this charming Italian restaurant. The greeting you receive when you walk in, is as if you are a returning friend there for dinner. They prepare osso buco once a week, it is outstanding.  Great service and wonderful wines."}
{"text":"Wow ... Francos back. A dream come true ... Even had dinner at his restaurant in New York ... Leave room for the Merenghata, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great birthday party place.  The specials are what makes Franco's, well, special.  The chicken dishes are all tasty and the sea bass was a hit for several of us.   The meal was capped with cheesecake, chocolate cake and glasses of their famous limoncello served by Franco himself.  Terrific service and all around fun."}
{"text":"The food is impeccable and the service was perfect my drink was never empty and everyone was super friendly. We had the bruschetta which me and my boyfriend agreed it was the best we've both ever had (and we both come from Italian families that love to cook). They had a special pasta dish that day that was just perfect, the sauce, pancetta and everything in the dish was fresh and a perfect combination, everything complemented each other so well I was full and still couldn't stop eating. We had a great lasagna dish with meat sauce and it was perfect The sauce was delicious. The cheesecake we had for desert was so fluffy and amazing. Franco and everyone came and checked in to make sure we were enjoying our meal. The environment is low lighting and very intimate I felt like we were the only ones that were there. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"De passage à Phoenix nous somme aller donner chez Franco 's. Très bien reçu,serveur sympathique service  Rapide et plat de qualité un vrais bon restaurant italien. Je le recommande à tous"}
{"text":"My wife and I are foodies and have been to some of the most highly rated restaurants in Phoenix (including North), but the two of us can easily say that Franco's is our favorite Italian restaurant in the city. The food is superb: the steak Florentine, which was perfectly seasoned and prepared, is hands-down the best I have ever had. However, we were equally impressed with the service. The restaurant is family-owned, and the owners take a genuine interest in their patrons' dining experience. Franco came by to make sure everything was to our liking, and Franco's daughter surprised us with dessert and limoncello for our anniversary. I cannot recommend the place highly enough. Go--you will be so glad you did!"}
{"text":"Amazing  place!  The food and service are terrific. While visiting Phoenix a month ago, my wife and I, on the recommendation of a friend,  dined at the restaurant, FRANCO ITALIAN CAFFE in Scottsdale.  We began the meal with a wonderful Prosecco and a shared seafood risotto, followed by veal chop with mushrooms and fillet mignon arrabbiata... both cooked to perfection and extremely delicious.  The meal was accompanied by a lovely bottle of Amarone Cordioli.  A perfect evening...no room for dessert!  Emilio New York, NY"}
{"text":"Franco's is excellent Italian fare - as good as it gets - as good and better than some of the food we had in Florence, Siena and Rome two weeks ago.     The antipasti plate - have it with the white anchovies!  Burrata, melon, proscuitto, red peppers excellent.  Veal scallopini - great sauce and the seafood risotto excellent.  Fresh ingredients - olive oil, surprised it is from CA - CORTO and can be purchased at AJs - is very good.     Franco is charming and a great chef."}
{"text":"Most amazing authentic Italian meal we've had in the valley. Whatever the owner/chef or sever recommends order it!!!!"}
{"text":"Myself and 3 other friends recently ate at Franco's in Old Town.  From the moment we sat down it felt like I was back in my grandma's kitchen.  Everything on the menu sounded incredible and from surveying the other patrons and the smiles on their faces we knew the food was going to be great. However, deciding what to order was becoming challenging until my girlfriend suggested we order family style. Our waiter, Antonio, was more than happy to accommodate our request. We ordered the lamb chops, veal, sea bass and a pasta trio.  Needless to say the food quality and presentation were absolutely incredible. For desert, we went old school Italian, cheeses and fruit accompanied by cappuccinos for everybody.  Once again, simply delightful. I do believe I have found my new favorite \"go to\" restaurant in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for a conference and someone recommended this restaurant. Let me say, I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but the service was exceptional and the food just as exceptional, so I just had to leave a review! If I'm ever back in Scottsdale I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"We heard Franco was back and decided it was the perfect place for our Anniversary dinner. And it was. The food was great, the service attentive and well paced and a special surprise from Franco to top off the evening made it memorable. We had our first meal at Franco's 23 years ago and he hasn't lost a step. Thanks for making our special day extra special."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experienced at Franco's! Service was impeccable, food was so delicious and timed perfectly. The prices were also very reasonable! I'll be back for sure! So many other things to try on the menu!!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to dinner based on reviews.  The staff was very nice and the decor very pleasant.  Unfortunately, the meals were just this side of awful.  The ravioli tasted very bland, pasty and store bought.  Half of the dish was boiling hot and the other half Luke warm.  My wife's squid ink seafood pasta was totally overcooked.  The seafood was rubbery and tough.  Both dishes were dry of sauce which did not help.  A very disappointing first and last visit.  I wouldn't recommend It."}
{"text":"Franco's Italian Cafe is an amazing place to eat!!  They have the best Italian food and the service is impeccable. If you have never been to Franco's it is definitely a place to try!!  You won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful evening at Franco's.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and the food was delicious.  A special place."}
{"text":"Dined at Franco's this evening and absolutely fell in love. Got lucky and got a walk-in spot early in the evening. Was thoroughly impressed by the amazing service as well as the appreciation shown by Franco.   The appetizers were delicious and would not end. We both ordered the ravioli and it was the freshest ravioli that either of us had ever tasted. Fine delicate layers and perfect toppings - tomato basil or meat sauce - whichever suits your preference. Terrific desserts and coffee, as well.   We plan on returning to Franco's, and will recommend it to our friends. Definitely a place worth your while. Brings new meaning to the phrase 'customer service'."}
{"text":"The newspaper gave a great write up about a local chef who came back to open a new Italian Restaurant. It doesn't feel like a traditional Italian restaurant since no lasagna, eggplant , or parmesan are on the menu. The menu is like going thru  gauntlets since they don't talk about the sides (or the prices), so it is up to your imagination as to what you get with your entree and what the price is.  Bottom like - VERY MEDIOCRE and no where near the hype....  We can do much better at the Italian Grotto"}
{"text":"Franco's Italian Cafe is a great local stop for authentic Italian food. Franco was the first to greet us and made us feel very welcome. Our waiter and the rest of the staff were all very helpful and professional. When we asked for a recommendation on a wine, Franco gave us a wine that was like none we had previously tasted, and then there was the food!.... It was incredible and the flavors blended so deliciously. The food alone will bring us back to Franco's. The quaint environment, the great service, and the wonderful wine is what will bring us back again and again."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience here this weekend. I live for Italian food and can say this was some of the best I've had. Not to mention Franco was an absolute gem - started us off with prosciutto and cheese, topped us off with some limoncello - made the first dining adventure that much better :)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about how impressed I am with Franco's. Franco is a pleasant man that makes great food!"}
{"text":"Having lived experienced all types of Italian cuisine in NYC and SF for a combined 20 years and being from NJ-I think I am qualified to offer a view or two about Italian cooking.  If you have not tried Franco's what are you waiting for?  We in the Scottsdale and greater Phoenix are blessed to have this place. Franco is like an old friend.  You can taste the thought and care behind in every bite."}
{"text":"What can I say. Franco is back in town and is serving some of the Best Italian around. I was a frequent diner at his past restaurant. From start to finish spot on. Great feel and intimate dinning room. A great value. We will be returning."}
{"text":"So delighted that we stopped in here tonight! The meal was outstanding! It is a smallish intimate place with white table cloths and retro art on the walls.  Our waiter was attentive and very efficient. He brought ice water and served a wonderful assortment of bread with delicious dipping oil.  I order one of the many specials Veal Scalopinni with fresh vegetables all cooked to perfection. The potatoes were broiled crispy on the hot side just like my Grandma used to make. The veal ha a nice spicy kick and yes I has to resist not licking my plate!  For dessert we had to share. Piece if Mascarponi Cheesecake garnished with perfect strawberries. Yum!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant!   Each time I come here I become more and more impressed! Franco is so wonderful and inviting! The food is so wonderful! Fresh, full of flavor and just delicious. I would recommend everyone trying this gem!   The service is awesome, very attentive and friendly staff! They always have wonderful suggestions if you can decide what wonderful entree to pick! Lovely atmosphere as well! I can't say anything negative about this place!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended!  Just went this past Sat night.  You better have reservations!  Seafood risotto and lasagna (only mild complaint was I wish it had more cheese and less meat).  Mr Franco is very nice!"}
{"text":"5 stars / 5 stars / 5 stars etc.  The King Franco is back in Scottsdale and we ought to change the name of Scottsdale Road to Franco's Road.  Simply the best in AZ in every way shape and form.  No one in town can compete with his veal and pasta!!  The competition is all trying to figure out how to deliver NY quality Italian food and they all fall way short of Franco.  Yes it is a busy place but where do you ever see the boss working his tail off 6 days a week making sure each and every patron is completely satisfied.  We dine there every week and the complete staff is super friendly and truly wants to see everyone enjoy the experience.  If you know what high quality Italian tastes like then you will arrive with a smile and leave with a bigger smile.  One of the TOP SECRET dishes that comes out of the kitchen is the Orrechie Elephante - pounded breaded veal chop (EJS style).  This will be parmigiana style with his outstanding Bolognese sauce.  After this dish you will never need to see his menu again.  Go make your reservation immediately!!  Eric S. - Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service! I'm from out of town and it's my first time here & I loved it! Really enjoyed my time! I ordered the Spaghetti Salsa Cruda & it was so good & filling! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I decided to pick Franco's for my birthday dinner on October, 30th, 2014.   All I can say is that they went above and beyond my expectations!  There were two tables of about 8 each and they handled both without a problem.  The waiters were amazing and very patient.  They explained any questions we had about the menu very thoroughly and always had a smile on their face.  The food was excellent. I highly recommend the lasagna!  Everyone loved what they ordered.  But the best part of the night is when they dimmed the lights, brought out 3 desserts on a plate  and sang happy birthday!  Franco's hit it on the nose.  Excellent service, quality food, and great atmosphere!  We will be back!  Thanks for making my birthday special!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive staff! Enjoyed dinner with a group of seven. Everyone loved their entree. The only argument was which dessert was best?!?  Order several and share! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and accommodating. The complimentary bread was cold (heating up bread goes a long way). The mozzarella di bufala and tomatoes were great. The frutti di mari squid ink linguine was very subpar. The linguine and shrimp was over cooked (I would have preferred al dente and flash boiled, respectively), the fish tasted very fishy (it must have been poorly prepared or not fresh), but the calms and cuttlefish/squid was cooked to perfection. We also had a pappardelle with a pork-based ragu style sauce. The pappardelle was dried and not fresh pasta. I had better dried pappardelle at Trader Joes. How does an Italian restaurant with an average of 4.5 stars on yelp not use fresh pasta? Even Safeway sells fresh pappardelle! The ragu was nothing special either; we did not bother to finish it. We moved onto the mascarpone cheesecake, which was awesome; it was light (for a cheesecake), sweet, and not too tart. I really wish I could give this place a higher rating, but based off the pastas, a three is as high as I can go."}
{"text":"My friends and I to this day still talk about the amazing meal and service we received this summer weekend. We yelped a place that was close to our hotel. Upon arrival at the restaurent it really seemed like a hidden gem, as the restaurent was fully booked with many italian families. Franco provided us with a sample menu featuring many of his best pastas and also recommended a number of dishes that were unique. It was such an amazing experience. It felt like being invited to share a meal with their family. Franco even let us sample a slice of cake that was his grandmother's secret recipe. Please do yourself a favor and pay them a visit."}
{"text":"Wonderful dinner, terrific service. My family of four enjoyed every bite from the appetizer to the dessert. We traveled to Italy last year, and felt like was were back in Rome for one more meal."}
{"text":"I'm usually not impressed with \"Italian\" restaurants, but this is by far the best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale. The food is amazing, the service is top notch and the overall atmosphere is very inviting.  This has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants in old town.   I highly recommend trying this place, you will not be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, its almost been 24 hours and I am still thinking about the delicious dinner I had last night.  I honestly cannot remember the last time I had such an amazing dinning experience.  I've definitely been to some of the nicer places in Scottsdale and while Franco's may not be as flashy (which gets very old, very fast) everything- from the ambiance, the wait staff, and ESPECIALLY the food was amazing and unique.  It probably helps that the restaurant is family owned and the owner is actually on-site- making sure everything is perfect.  There was literally not one element that I found less than satisfying, the olive oil was extremely fresh, the pasta to die for, and the porterhouse was probably the best I've ever had (and oh my goodness, don't even start me on dessert!)  I would be more descriptive about what I ate but I can't properly spell it all- all I know is that the pasta I ate was named the strangled priest (English translation) and the sauce was a recipe given to the restaurant's owner from a lady who lived on a mountain top in Italy. The environment is very un-Scottsdale.  This is the kind of place you'd envision a character in a romantic comedy taking his date in New York or San Francisco... small, intimate, and charming but it's family friendly as well.  It can get a little loud but that just adds to the familial air of the place. I could still hear my dining companion throughout the evening, so it was not bothersome at all.   Highly, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Like heaven in my mouth! Love the decor, the mood, and the food is 10 star!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going here for years. This by far the best Italian Restaurant in the valley, and they're a lot of good Italian restaurants in the valley today. The food is always superb and service is 5 star. The experience and food just keeps us coming back.  I always have something different when I go and nothing is ever disappointing. However one of my favorites is the Bistecca Florentine (dry aged in house), it is the best steak in town and I love Steak 44 as one of the best steakhouses in the country. Always cooked to perfection as requested, with a side of spinach and carrots along with the best fresh cut fries ever. A must have if you're a steak lover as myself.   Just go and experience it yourself. My wife would never go to Italian restaurant, since growing up with her Italian grandmother that lived with the family, when growing up, always cook for the family. So, a family from Italy test your food and love it. It has to be the best! And don't forget his homemade deserts..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place that makes you feel like family, Franco's is the place!  Great ambiance and amazing food.  My husband and I have been here quite a few times and every time, we are made to feel like returning family.  Franco watches over his guests as if he is hosting a party at his own home.  Any restaurant owner who treats his/her restaurant like their own home and their guests like family is a winner in my book.  And the food is so authentic and not overly indulgent.  They always have really good specials and will make you a classic even if it isn't on the menu (my husband always wants chicken parm, which isn't always on the menu).  We haven't ever had to order dessert because Franco usually brings us a nice sampling of all of the dessert cakes.  Thank you, Franco!  We love this place and hope you do, too."}
{"text":"Everything is absolutely amazing! The service, the food, the atmosphere, the location...cant go wrong with anything on the menu (i highly recommend the antipasto sampler that offers a variety of things to try). The owner is the friendliest man, as is his entire staff. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant.  Franco went out of his way to accommodate us without reservations.  The wait staff was attentive and provided great service.  The entrees were plentiful and delicious.  I ordered the orecchie elefante and my boyfriend ordered the veal scallopini. Wonderful presentation and fresh flavors.  And it's true about the olive oil, the best we'd ever tasted! We'll be back to try the pasta."}
{"text":"Small, intimate dining with outstanding food and service.  How can you really get any better than this???  My boyfriend introduced me to Franco's recently (he has been dining here for many years) and I have to say I have been completely blown away with the service and the amazing food.  It's so yummy...it's hard for me to decide what to order.  I have tried both a veal dish and a lamb dish.  Both have been perfection!    Dave, our waiter..is an absolute professional and a delight to have as our server.  Franco also stops by to check on us ...I mean, seriously....who does this any more?  I love it!    You are not going to find a better atmosphere in the heart of Old Scottsdale. Please don't pass this restaurant by  Thank you, thank you, thank you.!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! The owner brought is an antipasto plate with a few different meats & cheese on it that were all delicious. He then overheard my joke about sushi & brought tuna tartare for me to try and it was delicious and very fresh.   I had the Pasta Erbe Aromatiche on gluten free pasta for my entrée. It was sooo delicious. The sauce was very tasty and the pasta was the best gluten free pasta I've ever eaten. I seriously couldn't tell it was gluten free.   My husband had the veal special and loved it as well. Everyone in our group of 8 also really enjoyed it. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"In the midst of all the \"new\" and \"trendy\" restaurants opening, don't forget about this long time hidden gem in Old Town. We celebrated there with friends last night and were again impressed with the food and service. Once  seated at the table, the waiter brought fresh bruschetta and a plate of salami and cheese, compliments of the chef. The menu is extensive and full of traditional Italian fare and creative twists. Be sure to hear the daily specials as they are usually amazing. I had the special spaghetti and speck. Wow. The sauce had fresh tomatoes along with the speck and cannellini beans. Delish. My husband had the veal Marsala special and added a side of pasta. Again, amazing. Our friends had pasta off the menu and loved it. We had no room for dessert as the portions were huge! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Franco's really impressed me. All these years living in AZ and I can't believe I hadn't been. Much more classy than I expected. Definitely a date night type place. A plus that it doesn't have to be a heavy Italian pasta dinner if you don't want it to be.  I went with a group of about 16 and we sat in a nice private area by the entry. The wine and tequila flowed all dinner. To start we enjoyed sampler type platters. The buffalo mozzarella was heaven. The cantaloupe and meats paired outstandingly.   For my main I had the rack of lamb. Four nice size lamb medallions cooked to medium rare perfection and bursting with flavor. Some of the best I've ever had. The assortment of vegetables that came on the plate were YES.   For desert we had a sampler of all the deserts, with the cheesecake and the tiramisu being the hits. The tiramisu was melt in your mouth disintegrating coffee perfection.    Can't wait to come back and try the pork chop!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Franco is an amazing host. We had 7 people in our group and took care of everyone. The food exceeded everyone's expectations. I will be coming back here again. This is a must stop place if you are every in the area."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday, April 21.   We had the Lamb Chop Special and the Halibut, accompanied by the Escarole salad, and completed with a piece of mascarpone cheesecake and espresso.    Our waiter John was attentive and helpful.    Franco offered up some homemade limoncello.    Excellent meal coupled with excellent service.  We truly enjoyed our dinner.   Thank you, Franco!!!"}
{"text":"We're new residents of Old Town Scottsdale and have been enjoying exploring the many outstanding restaurants in the area. We were looking forward to Franco's, having tried to get a reservation there several days ago and being told they were booked up for the next four nights. I gave up at the time, but my wife called later and made a reservation for a weeknight the following week. While earlier than we preferred for dinner, she was persuaded to make a reservation for 5:30 p.m. because the later times were booked.  By the time we finished dinner that evening, we said, \"That's a one-time-only place.\" Here are our reasons: (1) We arrived at 5:30 to a nearly empty restaurant, and when we left around 7:00 p.m. it was barely over half full with several empty tables. We felt misled about how busy they are; and (2) The food was so-so at best, but the check for the two of us that included one glass each of Sangiovese, two salads, a pasta dish with no meat, and a below-average sea bass dish came to just under $100 without tip! Ouch!   The only positive note was the fine service. The hostess was pleasant, our waiter was attentive, and a number of other staff members were alert and responsive to us. The person who refilled our water glasses was so attentive that he refilled them almost without fail by the time we had consumed about 1/2 inch of water. We saw his friendly, smiling face many times during the meal.   Franco's seemed a bit like a tired and dated place. While well established, it seemed to lack authenticity, charm, and good Italian food. Our overall recommendation is, \"Don't bother.\""}
{"text":"Italian at it's finest! This the best Italian food my husband and I ever had, this includes NYC, Chicago and Italy.  Rita &  Robert Davis Boise"}
{"text":"My friends and I celebrated my birthday at Francos and it was the best birthday ever! Being a Friday night they were busy but we had no problem with the wait staff and they were very helpful with explaining the menu and specials.  The food is fresh, authentic, and prepared wilth attention to detail.  Too often dining in Scottsdale is an experience that ends up feeling like just another dinner at an overly hyped and trendy restaurant.  These people are the real deal and care abouit their patrons!  I plan to be celebrating many more occasions at Franco's!"}
{"text":"This is one of the most authentic and delicious Italian restaurants I have ever been too, not to mention the staff was amazing!  The food was hands down some of the best.  I had their veal special (cannot spell what it was called), also shared my friends veal chop and tried some of the pasta...all were amazing!  The wine selection was very extensive, and they also had a full bar.  Definitely recommend for groups, dates or just good night out - supper close to everything is old town too."}
{"text":"Yep!  Believe the hype on this hidden gem! The staff is as good as the food, attentive from the valet to the waiter/waitress and bus help.  And Oh! My! is the food good, if you want a place to call home, you can do no better than Franco's"}
{"text":"The most amazing Italian food in Arizona!!! Great service and fun atmosphere. Franco's standards are very, very high."}
{"text":"The food, service and ambience are simply outstanding.  You feel as though you've stepped into an old Italian restaurant in Chicago or NY.  Try the frutti de mare with ink squid pasta....their specialty.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"OK - I have been very sad since Franco pulled out of the Esplanade and moved his cuisine to NYC. I found out yesterday he was back and my wife I and I promptly went there for dinner last night.   The service was great, food exceptional and as you might expect Franco was there a working the restaurant with his passion for customer service to create a wonderful dining experience.   It was such a delight to order a meal that was very tasty and well portioned. The wine list is also fantastic. They have $20 bottles that go great with an Italian meal as well as some pricier bottles if you are so inclined.   Franco, we are glad to have you back!"}
{"text":"The food was very good here. But the attitude of the front hostess women and the owner completely ruined my friends birthday dinner. They were not friendly from the moment we walked in. They were pushy and stressed out. It was a very negative atmosphere from start to end. I would love to go back again for the food but I will never return."}
{"text":"This place is a joke does not say anywhere you need a reservation to eat dinner. Showed up with my wife to have dinner and the valet Parking asked if we had a reservation? I replied no do you need one? He says maybe and opens the door and the hostess and older gentleman looked at me and my wife like we were not worthy to eat at this restaurant. I felt like we were racially looked at. I would never eat there or recommend anyone to eat there if that is the type of service they provide."}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the valley!  Fantastic service, authentic food, and excellent cocktails. If you are looking for a true Italian experience this is the place. We had the veal chop and charcuterie special, best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Called for take out because it was really good last time I was in town. Sorry...we can't help you. We are too busy. Try again later. Really?  Wait, the last time I was in town the weather was bad and they had plenty of time for someone willing to brave the weather. I know other restaurants with similar ratings that would have handled this situation a lot differently. Just disappointed...I expected more."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite restaurants. The owner takes a personal interest in making sure everything is perfect. If he isn't available, his daughter and sometimes wife are on duty. This gives the place a family feel of caring and quality. All of the food is excellent. Often they have a lot of special items not on the menu. My last dish was the best gnocchi I've ever had. The pesto sauce was perfect with cherry tomatoes added as a nice touch. My husband had the pork chop special. It was a generous portion and perfectly cooked.   Service is top notch and pleasant. Our water glasses were always full. Prices are within range of similar places in Scottsdale.  Give it a try if you are visiting the area. Make it one of your go-to places if you are a local."}
{"text":"The guy who mentioned that the Italian Grotto was better was demented.  Francos is well priced, very good food, not the junky regulr Italian food but refined Italian food like you get in Italy.  Prices VERY WELL PRICED, small intimate.  The owner has such passion, he is allover the restaurant helping and greeting people.  Where can you get a 3 course meal for two with a decent bottle of Italian wine for less that a $100. Go its worth it.  Italian Grotto makes me laugh"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time, it's the best Italian place I've found since leaving the east coast. It's always fresh the menu changes and I always see the owner busy working the tables. The service is impeccable, and has been the same since I started going there. The red headed waitress that's always there is personable and professional. I'd highly recommend Franco's but make a reservation it's always packed."}
{"text":"We still go to Franco's.  It's our number one favorite because the Food is excellent, the staff is equal, and number one should have been it's Always consistent.  We know everything will be prepared perfectly!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with fantastic service.  It was our first time and we will go back.  The food was cooked to perfection and the portions were perfect.  The fact that Franco seats you and thanks you for the business with a shot for desert is great; we're already looking forward to our next visit..."}
{"text":"Just went to Franco's this past Thursday.  Very good service and friendly.  Glad to see the owner greeting customers and helping serve the tables.  Unfortunately, the dinner was good, but not spectacular.    We started with the grilled calamari and the polenta appetizers.  The calamari were four small pieces placed on some arugula.  Polenta was served with gorgonzola and is less firm than I am used to.  The polenta came after the calamari and was not as warm as it should be.  Probably was sitting for a bit.    For dinner, we had the veal chop, the rigatoni special and the seafood risotto.  Seafood risotto was probably the best out of the three.  All good, but not great.  Risotto was just right and creamy.  Rigatoni was made with a chicken and leek ragu.  Pasta was cooked al dente as it should be, but the dish was a bit too dry.  I don't like a lot of sauce, but this was not even enough to flavor the whole pasta.  Dish was a little bland.  The veal chop was cooked to my liking, but was not as tender or full of flavor as I would expect at this restaurant.  Still waiting to find a really good Italian restaurant in this town"}
{"text":"This is the quintessential authentic Italian dining experience in Scottsdale.  The owner is almost certainly a native of Italy; his wonderful accent adds to the atmosphere of the establishment.  Furthermore, Italians typically have a very particular brand of hospitality, and you definitely get a healthy dose of it here.  He stopped by numerous times to speak with us and make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  I had the frutti di mare and it was fantastic.  They make their own pasta every day and it shows...  It's some of the best pasta I've ever had.  The tiramisu is absolutely perfect-- the cake is dripping with coffee and the cream on top is spectacular.  If you enjoy authentic Italian food, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Had the seafood pasta special and oh, was it special. They offer gluten free pasta and it's cooked to perfection. They also have an excellent selection of wines. All told, you can't go wrong here!  After ordering a few bottles of wine the anti-pastas began to flow from the kitchen."}
{"text":"wonderful dinner at franco\"s. there were 6 of us and the food and service was excellent. I had Fettuccine Tartufo that was just heavenly! we had to wait for one couple and the waiter brought us cheese and prosciutto along with bread and olive oil.  everyone's food was excellent and service couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Scottsdale we found this gem of a restaurant. From the moment that Franco greeted us at the door, we knew that this was going to be a special place. Service was the best from John and the very friendly bar tenders that catered to us like we were the only ones in the place. Busy Friday night during auction season, we were quickly seated and felt lucky to score a reservation just a few days in advance. The menu is traditional Italian with all of the favorites including virtually any variation or special request that you can imagine. The chefs are very accommodating. We ordered two entrees that weren't on the menu but were suggested by John as options to the five or six specials that evening. Franco's mothers recipes are recreated with love daily and her frozen dessert is over the top. Reasonably priced and so enjoyable was our evening that we returned several night later and did the entire meal over again with some great variations. We can't wait to return next year to this quaint little Italian bistro. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian food. We went for my father in law's birthday, there were seven of us and we all really enjoyed what we ate. Great wine list, fresh, homemade pasta, good sized portions. The bruschetta was terrific and so was the Caesar salad. The fettucini with meat sauce was terrific. They even let us bring our own birthday cake for dessert. Service could not have been better. Even though the restaurant was super busy on a Friday night, our server and busser were incredibly attentive. If you want great Italian food in an upscale casual atmosphere, this is the place. Valet is $6."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant. The service is amazing and the food is incredible.   They always offer unique and delicious specials. Outside of New York City, this is by far the best Italian restaurant you will ever have the pleasure of dining at.   Franco is extremely talented! This place will have you coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Franco's is the best Italian in AZ.  Period.  Franco is an amazing host, it's like you're eating at his house with his family."}
{"text":"By far best Italian food in the area. Perhaps best Italian food I have had in my life. The hospitality by Mr Franco makes the experience even more memorable. Veal and halibut were exceptional. Dessert screams \"yummy.\""}
{"text":"The service was excellent.  Having a dairy allergy limits what I can eat and they were very accommodating to my allergies and went out of their way to make sure I was more then satisfied.   I would highly recommend this spot to any Italian food lovers! In a great area too, close to lots is shops and other restaurants."}
{"text":"Franco's is an authentic Italian restaurant.  While vacationing in Scottsdale, my wife and I  celebrated our wedding Anniversary at Franco's.  We Started with a tomato and buffalo cheese anti-pasto.  We had the Delicious angel hair pasta in sauce and spaghetti and clams. Dessert is very decadent - \"the governors chocolate\" cake and strawberry meringue.    Dinner was complimented by a glass of Pino Grigio and a Merlot.  The staff at Fraco's treated us to Limoncello shots as an anniversary treat !!"}
{"text":"I had one of the best nights I can recall in a very long while!  I came to Franco's to meet a few of my friends for dinner on a Tuesday evening and was running a bit later than the rest of my group.  I arrived to the warm welcome of Franco and Leela and was escorted to the table where my friends had already been seated.  Everything about the evening was lovely, the delicious food (I had the pleasure of tasting the Caesar salad, which was the best I've ever eaten, as well as the Frutti di Mare which, again, was breathtakingly delicious), the service, and the ambience.  I felt attended to while at the same time free to enjoy my food and conversation without interruption.  I was so impressed that I even took an entree \"to-go\" home to my boyfriend who was not able to come that evening.  He ordered the 1/2 rack of lamb and, even though it came to him after a bit of a drive in the car, he thoroughly enjoyed it and will be sure to come in person in the future.    I would recommend to anyone looking to have a evening to remember.  I will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Good good food.  Nice atmosphere and friendly servers.  We had a good experience here.  I liked the linen table clothes and dim lighting in the dining room."}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place less than 4 stars McDonald's is your type of place..this is the creme de la cream of places.Excellent perfect service attentive.The owner Franco is a sweetheart OMG I just want to put him in my pocket and hug him.such a nice man great food ..we came in with no reservations on a date night around 7pm..he took our number said he would call us back..they were busy so they called later than agreed.we arrived but no table.they sat us by the door but gave us free cheeses,drinks and entrees.By the time we got a table we were stuffed .Franco the owner moved us personally to the main floor..ordered us more wine on the house,main course and dessert !all free due to inconvenience..what would have been a $150 bill..ended up being $2.50 lol for cappuccino.needless to say we left a hefty tip.Just the service attention to detail ..flawless!i am a customer for life."}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things about this place.  The ambiance, the service, the food.  All GREAT.  Definitely deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Since my family of four returned from Florence over Christmas 2016, we had a craving for Bistecca alla fiorentina (Steak Florentine).   Franco comes closest to replicating the dish here in Phoenix metro area.  Pasta is also lovely.  Best way to enjoy the food here is to share.  Order a starter, a couple of pasta and a few meat dishes.  Enjoy with friends and family.  We have celebrated many birthdays and anniversary here.  Brought a few out of town friends as well.   After dinner, take a short walk to water front and enjoy the cooler evening.  Price is reasonable given food quality and services.   Wine price is also quite good."}
{"text":"Amazing meal. We all liked our plates! So glad to have Franco back!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal with added bonus having Franco greet and take our requests for dinner. Sublime figs with goat cheese and prosciutto. The shrimp and lobster spaghetti was excellent and my halibut was perfectly prepared...so often fish is poorly handled and overlooked. Perfectly moist. The side vegetables and au gratin potatoes were perfect.   For the earlier reviewers who whined about take out (really?) and not being impressed are in a distinct sub minority of the chronically unhappy diners who can never find what they want.  Good for us who can continue to enjoy Franco's charm and comfortable service.  Oh I have not even mentioned the value.  A complete experience.  This is #1 in my book for total experience.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Omg....we loved it.    Excellent knowledgable service.  My lasagna was probably the best i have ever had.    Franco greeted us at the door.  Valet parking to make it simple they are in a busy part of scottsdale.  Great idea.  The salad was a special of the night. Artichoke salad over a bed of arugula with endive chips and shaved Parmesan it was delightful.  My husband at the house salad with was just a basic green salad with light Italian vinaigrette it was great too.  Husband ordered the shrimp Penny and he enjoyed it very much. They use real Sicily Italian recipes we just thoroughly enjoyed it. Great atmosphere, great service, great food ......great night.  Franco also threw in a piece of flourless chocolate cake because it was our first time visiting it was out of this world. Thanks Franco's!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Franco's that hasn't already been said?  It is cozy, popular and in a good location in Old Town Scottsdale.   My husband enjoyed the orecchiette with wild boar ragu and I enjoyed the ravioli.  They both were generous portions, the pasta was homemade and the sauce was divine...absolutely tasty!  The service was impeccable and the owner stopped by a few times to make sure we were happy with our meal and the entire experience - nice touch!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in the Valley. Absolutely love this place. Staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant. I highly recommend checking this out!!"}
{"text":"Went to Franco's last night for my boyfriend's birthday. Needless to say, it was amazing. We are full blooded italian, I am second generation and the food reminds me of my own families cooking. Franco is great, very kind and thankful to have you in his place. You can tell he is passionate and loves what he does. Thank you for an amazing experience! I am already planning my return for birthday in July !!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best italian food I have had in Arizona!! The location has great atmosphere! I would definitely recommend them. I ordered the seafood risotto which was delicious they also had some great specials and very knowledgable staff!"}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! Nice menu selections and attentive service. Be sure and leave room for the desserts as they are deliciously!!"}
{"text":"When we walked in Franco himself greeted us and asked us to pick our table and he surprised us with a very generous plate of thinly sliced prosciutto and cheese. We also received a bread basket with at least four kinds of fresh bread and very high quality olive oil. The menu is interesting and does differ from other Italian Restaurants I've been too but I also wasn't expecting the very long list of added specials to choose from.  We started with the Grilled Vegetable Plate that included a variety of vegetables with the most delicious mushrooms I've ever tasted.  Next we shared one of the house made pastas it was the Fettuccine Tartufo. It really was a WOW dish. The sauce of Black Truffles with some olives was addictive and I found myself sucking the insides of my mouth to keep tasting the sauce. It's not the kind of sauce I normally like but this one was light and not heavy for what it was. The pasta it's self was very thin and light but still had some body to it.  For dinner I had to choose the Halibut special since it is in season now. I was presented with a great plate of well executed food. The halibut was very moist and fresh and was on top of the most simple but most delicious tomatoes with basil I've tasted in a while and it had a little kick to it too. The plate also came with two vegetables and very dreamy layered creamy potatoes. Everything was seasoned so perfect I couldn't say it was too much of something or not enough of something else.   My husband had another one of the specials that was a Veal Scaloppini Dish with a well made sauce that contained cherry peppers.   We tried the Merenghata it a semifreddo between a crisp meringue. The center was cold and like whipped cream and ice cream and the meringue was like a crisp cloud. It seemed very light and was easy to eat.  SIMPLE, fresh well prepared food priced very reasonably.  Franco personally thanked us for coming.  You have to do valet parking because they don't have a parking lot. The valet cost $5.00 before tip. This place is small and busy so you need a reservation."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we don't each much Italian but such great service and dishes! We were greeted by Franco himself and while leaving he also opened the door to thank us. Wonderful place with a lot of history:)"}
{"text":"Best meal I have ever eaten in Arizona. These guys take their food seriously. The lamb chops were do die for. The service was impeccable. I will come back."}
{"text":"WOW!  What an amazing dinner!  Inside, the atmosphere was very nice.  Quiet, immaculate and excellent service.  I had checked out their menu online before leaving and had already decided on the Fettuccine with truffle sauce!  AMAZING.  However, when the waiter came to tell us the specials I was completely confused.  I love rack of lamb and of course that was one of their specials, along with a wonderful veal dish!  Almost took me away from my Fettuccine with truffles.  The person I was with had the rack of lamb that looked fantastic.  He thoroughly enjoyed it.  I cannot tell you how wonderful my dinner was!  The Fettuccine was perfectly cooked and the truffles and truffle sauce were amazing!   There was not a speck left on my plate.  Their house Pinot Noir was also very good..two glasses good!  Being a first-generation Italian I was raised on great Italian cooking.  Franco's did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Fantastico!! It's like going to Tuscany (been there, done that). Had the grilled vegetables, perfectly cooked and delicious. The portobello is to die for. Also had the seafood pasta, again perfectly cooked, the shrimp were tender, the calamari was al dente, not rubbery, and fish was delicate and flaky. The atmosphere is elegant, but relaxed. The service is attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Mine and my fiances favorite restaurant! We live in Los Angeles and have been to Franco's the past 3 years when we go to MLB spring training. We actually visited them on a Sat and Mon night this last time because once just wasn't enough.  We've made it a tradition to visit Franco's every time we're in the area. Besides the food, the service is impeccable. Cheers to Franco himself as he's always there to greet us at the front door!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best Italian restaurant In Arizona! I feel like I am back in Italy when I step into this place. When I get my food and take my first bite its like my 100 percent Italian Grandmother was in the kitchen cooking. complete satisfaction from the service to the atmosphere to the food. even the valets are cool!  A+ highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great!  What a wonderful evening of delicious food and a warm and welcoming environment.  The food was undoubtedly all home made - pasta, sauce, and creativity to develop wonderful and tasty dishes.  The owner - Franco, was present for all aspects of the evening - greeted us when arriving, directing staff, serving dishes, and thanking us for dining there!  The servers were all friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.  We had the artichoke salad, veal special, ravioli, and pasta and meat sauce.  All savory with flavor.  To top the meal we had a great selection of wine and not to mention a wonderful meringue dessert -  We were stunned when we got the bill - it was reasonable! We will most certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"Served by a 70 something year old who's still really passionate about everything that goes on a plate. It's a beautiful thing. Casual, small place with great service. Homemade pastas, grilled calimari app was really good. Just great neighborhood feeling Italian spot."}
{"text":"You've Merenghata try Franco's Italian Caffe! This adorable, blink and you'd miss it (or walk right passed it as in our case), restaurant is a true gem located in Old Town Scottsdale.   Franco himself sat us when we came in and thanked us for coming out that evening when we left. Little touches like that are a rarity when dining nowadays so it is such a delight when it happens.   The elegant atmosphere and warm mood of the Franco's is a date night dream. But, also, makes for a great place to treat the family, have a special birthday, or impress out-of-town guests.  We had the Bufala Mozzerella and Tomato, Fettuccine Tartufo (with real truffles), and the special, which was Ricotta & Spinach Dumplings in a Bolognese sauce. All pastas are made in-house and the sauces are full of flavor.  Everything was wonderful but the real star is the Merenghata. It is worth the trip alone! It was so light and airy. Combined with the juxtaposition of cold melting-in-your-mouth Semifreddo and the crispy Meringue outside -- this dessert is beyond DEVINE! We also were given a sample of the Mascarpone Cheesecake. It was delicious as well, creamy with just a little hint of a tang.   With over 50 years in the restaurant business, you can almost taste all the history with each dish you have at Franco's!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food!!!! Such a great experience, we will be back! Oh and make sure to get dessert they are unbelievable"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Fabulous food. The service was so professional and personable. Our table had on the menu items as well as the daily specials...everything was as described and excellent. I would highly recommend this restaurant for authentic Italian with that special intimate elegant feel. Thank you for a great evening."}
{"text":"I am Italian and when my Italian family came here to visit, I had no doubts. My dad is the classic Italian man...only Italian food is good and actually only my mom can make great food. This is really romantic but it can be a problem to find the right restaurant especially if it's not in Italy.  After our dinner my dad told me...\"Questo ristorante e` fantastico!\" (This restaurant is fantastic!).  This means that the 5 stars are almost not enough!  Authentic Italian food and great service."}
{"text":"This isn't your typical white wash Italian restaurant! Amazing!!!!!!! The owner is out of the world with his hospitality!!! Thank you Franco's!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Franco's on Saturday evening and had the most wonderful meal.  I love veal piccata and when the waiter mentioned that, although it wasn't on the menu, they could also do a veal piccata, I was thrilled.  It was the best veal piccata that I have ever had.  The balance of the veal, the lemon and the capers was so perfect.  Wow! I had the pasta erbe Aromatiche and it almost tempted me away from the veal.  I'm going to have a hard time deciding what to have the next time we go!  Love it!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with lovely atmosphere.  It sits right in the heart of old town Scottsdale and we were so pleased to speak with Franco and discover that he is a real Italian from Tuscany and his food reflects this fact.  The service couldn't have been better.  Franco generously brought us out some prosciutto, salami and a delectable place of veal meatballs with a yummy tomato sauce.  I had the Orecchie elefante which was perfect and my family had homemade pasta in a marinara sauce which was also delicious.  He has very good prices on wine.  Some bottles are only $24.  The restaurant is both casual and elegant.  The food is delicious and the service was friendly and efficient.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"MAGNIFICO!   If you are looking for great Italian, look no further than Franco's. Italy served on plate and doesn't get much more authentic without a 12 hour flight.   Post up at a corner table with fresh pressed white linens and make sure you wear roomy pants!   I've been here a few times with the same group of friends and I love the feel when you walk into the place. It's a quaint and intimate restaurant and make sure to make a reservation or be prepared to wait. If you opt for the latter - no worries- it's worth it!  Starting off with their traditional bruschetta is a must! The perfect concoction of simple spices, fresh tomatoes and onions, is to die for. I am personally not a huge fan of tomatoes, but I can't help but gobble them up in this dish. Simple delicious! Next try the bufala mozzarella and tomato, your tastebuds will thank you! Now on to the main course; pasta! Franco wakes up and makes homemade pasta every morning, and the fruits of his labor show! Any pasta dish you choose, will be sure delight you and send you into full comfort mode. This past weekend, my boyfriend and I couldn't decide on what to indulge in, so we decided to order two plates and share them. We dug into a heaping helping of the chicken contadina, and the filet. Perfectly cooked, fresh ingredients and we left with happy tummies... But not before dessert! Limoncello and the best mascarpone cheesecake I've ever put on a fork-completely fantastic, creamy and not too sweet.  Service has always been consistently on point and fun. Every server seems enthusiastic about the menu and the time and care that goes into preparing things.   Nestled in an old building in downtown Scottsdale, this place is perfect for a night out on the town with friends or a date!   Ciao!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the very best Italian place in the city,then Franco's is it. It has it all.great authentic food,service ,ambience and the best host and gentleman.Franco makes you feel like family without being overbearing. He makes sure you have a wonderful experience. I recommend any Veal or Pasta dish. Everything is great.  We have been happy customers for years."}
{"text":"We were in Arizona from the SF bay area for our son's college orientation. It was our meal before heading to the airport and I wanted good Italian food.  So glad we found Franco's!  We were warmly greeted and seated immediately.  Franco graciously shared a lovely meat and cheese plate.  We ordered a nice house Chianti and settled in for an amazing meal in a warm, friendly environment.  We shared the pasta in truffle/cream sauce, meat sauce pasta (Franco's grandmother's recipe) and an AMAZING rack of veal seasoned and cooked perfectly on the rotisserie.  PERFECT meal, start to finish.  The bread was fresh and delicious, the olive oil was great too!  We consider ourselves to be \"foodies\" and would recommend Franco's to anyone lucky enough to get a reservation.  Thanks Franco's for a fabulous meal :)"}
{"text":"I visited Franco's for the first time this week in Old Town Scottsdale.  It's located right on Scottsdale and Drinkwater so you can't beat the location.  There aren't a lot of small, traditional Italian restaurants in the area so this already gives Franco's one leg up.    The ambiance is small and intimate but also somewhat noisy and crowded since it's a tiny restaurant.  The service is great!  The waiters are older, well experienced in the food industry with a great understanding of the menu items and nightly specials.    The menu is very traditional Italian because there aren't any descriptions the items.  The waiter will reveal several nightly specials which all sounded superb and I recommend ordering one of the specials if they sound good to you.  I have a sea bass special with roasted tomatoes and spinach. It was so delicious!  One of the best fish dishes I have had a restaurant.  I also had a marinated artichoke salad to start which was great and tasty but probably not memorable.  The bread basket isn't worth your time so just save room for the main course!"}
{"text":"I mean ... it's old school vibes and old people vibes and a little snooty. Food is solid 3.5 stars.   I guess maybe I just expected more from the positive Yelp reviews.  But if you're in town visiting and have just one night in Scottsdale ... probably not the move."}
{"text":"My evening at Franco's was fantastic! Upon entering the restaurant I was immediately welcomed by Franco and his daughter Leela. They were professional, warm and attentive throughout the meal, making sure that all my needs were met.  The food is authentic, flavorful, and clearly crafted with care (the pasta is handmade!!!!). The highlights of my meal were the fresh caesar salad, the rich and comforting fettuccine with meat sauce, and a heavenly slice of cheesecake (do not leave without this dessert--seriously).   I highly recommend Franco's to anyone looking for fantastic service, high quality food and a pleasant dining atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. Had the halibut which was a special that evening. The place is small but that does not take away from the experience. The restaurant has a separate, brick enclosed eating area. Because of how busy they were I was seated in this room. The sounds echo very loudly off the brick and so I got to enjoy the large party next to me and their wild conversations. Back to the food, fresh and well prepared. The prices are a bit high but worth it. I would recommend this mom and pop restaurant for a nice meal out."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite Scottsdale restaurant. Franco and his staff truly do go above and beyond. As we were leaving, Franco was having dinner with his family and friends, yet went out of his way to get up and give us a handshake before we left. World class service. We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Franco's since the late 90's. He has moved to a few different locations and we always follow. I can confidently say I have never had a bad dinner, if you had something not quite to your liking I am sure the staff would do anything to make you satisfied. This is one spot I know for sure if you have a special occasion to celebrate, business meeting, family in town or need a place to hold a party this is the place. The service is always spot on (thanks Dave) and the food always leaves you excited to return because you know it will as good or better then the last time you had it.(always a hit) Most nights you will see Franco himself greeting you and checking in with you which is always a nice added touch because he takes deep sincere pride in his restaurant and it show with every bite of food you take."}
{"text":"While we haven't tried every Italian place in the valley we have had several and both my wife and I enthusiastically claim Franco's to be the best Italian we have ever had in any city! Franco greats you at the door and the staff takes time to get to know you. We are regulars and they know our regular orders and drinks and take the time to talk and be friendly. The staff and customer experience only enhances a fabulous dinner. We have made our way through most of the menu and I can honestly say we have yet to be disappointed. So really.....if it sounds good just get it. We have a business right around the corner so it is awesome to have a place so good so close and a place we can send people."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing hospitality! Definitely a fantastic choice. Franco is awesome & it was a great evening!  Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled apon this place and let me tell you it is fantastic!!!! Everything was amazing! My favorite was the house made fabulous with meat sauce...... Still dreaming about it. The staff was friendly and the chef or owner (not sure) even came out and to check on people."}
{"text":"February 9, 2017: My wife & I went to this restaurant and really loved the Porkchop and linguine with meat sauce  as well as the portobello mushroom."}
{"text":"Ever since we discovered this place we have been going weekly. It is small, cozy, and very friendly but most of all, the food and service are top notch. We have been to Italy twice this year and eating here is just as good. Many of the customers are repeats, and for good reason -- it's a quality place. It has about 20 tables and a four seat bar, the wine list is adequate and the food choices superb. Seafood risotto, several pasta choices, veal and fresh fish are available nightly, and if you try one of the Italian deserts you will be hooked for sure. If you want a quiet, friendly and very memorable Italian meal, this is your choice in Scottsdale for sure."}
{"text":"Franco's, located in Old town Scottsdale, is the definition of an old-school Italian restaurant with authentic homemade Italian comfort food matched with very personable individualized service.  Upon entering the somewhat small restaurant, Franco greets everyone with a warm smile.  The first thing you notice on the wall to the left of the entrance is a picture of Franco with Andrea Boccelli. During  Andrea Bochelli's last visit to Phoenix, his entourage  ate at Franco's twice!   When I made the reservations for our party of 10, I describe the restaurant to the rest of our party as reminiscent of an older Italian restaurant from San Francisco's in the 1970s.  Once seated, we immediately got to business, ordered a couple bottles of wine as well as a few mixed drinks. Franco provide bruschetta  on the house. The bread was soft and paired very well with the fragrant tomato and olive oil.  After that we enjoyed an appetizer of meats and cheeses that was delicious fresh and quite authentic. They also brought out an assortment of bread with extra-virgin olive oil for dipping. My main meal of squid ink seafood pasta was delicious. It had an enormous amount of different types of seafood such as shrimp halibut and calamari. Flavors were very fresh, but not bold. I also tried to hand made ravioli which was delicious and apparently made six hours earlier. Dessert was an assortment of four or five different types of cakes, all made in house. There was cheesecake, Tiramisu, chocolate cake, you get the picture. They paired very well with the espresso and cappuccino is that we ordered.   Service is very good and quite quick. If I had to choose any faults, it would be that the alcohol beverages and mixed drinks took a little too long to come to the table. As did the espresso/cappuccino.   Valet parking is available in front and comes in handy and is very convenient. If you are a vegetarian, let them know ahead of time and he will make it a splendid meal for you also."}
{"text":"Wow! We visited from Denver on a birthday trip for my wife's birthday and we were beyond impressed! The meal was authentic Italian, delicious, and a welcoming atmosphere made this dining experience one to remember! The owner went above and beyond to make us feel welcome which was much appreciated. If we ever come back to the area, we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the place to go for the most amazing and delectable authentic italian you've ever had! Franco is the most wonderful host to the evening and we always feel like family when we eat there; which could never be too often! Last night we enjoyed the bruschetta and pasta trio of pesto, aromotiche, and tartufo for our appetizer round. The flavors are out of this world! Although my hands down favorite is the tuna mostardo dish, I went with the bisteca last night. It was cooked perfectly and mouthwateringly delicious. Now I have a new favorite! They dry age the meat for 18 days for the best quality and flavors possible. Make sure not to leave without trying the merenghata! I was introduced to this dessert at Franco's and now it's my favorite sweet treat ever!   Best italian in phoenix! And easily the best I've ever tasted. This place is a must-see for every food lover out there!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night at 6pm for an early Valentine's dinner. The perfect Valentine's experience. Crowded but not loud. The restaurant is small but elegant with an Italian flair and very attentive staff including the owner, Franco.   The seafood risotto was loaded with high quality seafood, the seasoning and taste spectacular.  The veal piccata was absolutely delicious served with sautéed spinach among other vegetables.  The dishes were well prepared and the portions were generous.  We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Everything here was great start to finish. The ambiance is warm and inviting, the food is homemade and delicious, the service was friendly, knowledgable and attentive. I would absolutely come back here. Listen to the reviews, it's well worth the stop in."}
{"text":"We discovered this gem when my husband's rental car broke down in front of it thanks to a messed up fuel filter.   Franco and David welcomed him inside out of the 106 degree Arizona heat and made sure he was hydrated and comfortable even though he wasn't a paying customer at that time. That won my respect immediately since this restaurant is known for being quite upscale and posh. They could have easily left him out there and been irritated by the \"inconvenience\" - instead they were understanding and caring.  Hubby, after reading the menu and being a true lover of all things Italy (having been there, not lying, 40+ times during his career in the Navy), made reservations so we could celebrate our pregnancy graduating to the second trimester over a romantic dinner.  We got there, were greeted by the hostess and Franco. David sat us immediately and we were served bread and perhaps the most amazing high quality olive oil I've ever tasted.  We started with the Caprese. The mozzarella was incredible. HUGE pieces of incredible flavor that melted in your mouth in joy inducing deliciousness. Fresh basil, perfectly ripened tomatoes, PERFECT greens lightly touched in a refreshing vinaigrette.   Hubby ordered the salmon Cesar salad. I ordered the House Mista. Both of us were in absolute heaven with our respective salad choices. They were simply exquisite. Nothing cheap. Huge.   For dinner? Hubby ordered the ricotta and spinach Ravioli with a tomato basil sauce. I ordered the Fettuccine in meat sauce.  ... There was a lot of bliss to be had. The tomato basil was loaded with chunks of resplendent roasted garlic and the ravioli large and stuffed beyond compare with an amazing filling worthy of awards.  And when I tasted my own fare? Angels sang. In my mouth.   The flavor note are dramatic, but light. They're refreshing and crisp and fail to be the assault that Sicilian food tends to hold.... Trust me. I LOVE Sicilian, but Franco's offers true north western Italian flavor. Florentine flavor. Unique in every way and fantastic in the way that it's bucked and broken free of the often mundane Italian food stereotype of Chicken Parm and pizza. No. This was heaven, packed and perfectly presented as art, on warmed white plates.  We HAD to have desert after this. Had to. I the Merenghata which David touted was Franco's grandmother's own special recipe. Hubby? Indulged in the Tiramisu; Franco's own mother's recipe.  The flavors, like everything else, were bold and beautiful. The Tiramisu light and soft, the Merenghata sweet and lavish, it's frozen core refreshing against the hot Arizona evening.     All in all? 5 stars. I wish I could give it 10. I wish I could give more and do more for this restaurant for it's truly a gem and perhaps the best Scottsdale has to offer.   If you haven't tried it? DO IT! You have nothing to lose and an experience that pleased every single one of your senses to gain.  And to Franco and David? My eternal thanks for taking such good care of my husband when he landed on your doorstep.   You have our business for life."}
{"text":"I have returned twice since my original review. Maybe our expectations were unrealistic after our first visit, because that night was outstanding in all categories.   With the return visit, I believe that two in the party just ordered the wrong dinner and we were disappointed. The third person had a ravioli dish that was superb and the service was excellent.   With our last visit, I was again disappointed with my main course. The rest of our party did enjoy their main course and the appetizer was excellent. But this time, our waiter was a noticeable step down in service and attitude. Maybe just an off night for him.  Franco's restaurant is really a special place and we hope to get it right next time. After looking at all the reviews here, I have a couple of tips on what to order next time."}
{"text":"Just left Franco's after our first dinner there. The food was outstanding. We tried the seafood risotto, lasagna, an herb-infused pasta and the fettuccine tartufo with black truffles. Each dish was of excellent quality and taste and the homemade pasta was soooo good. The only reason I don't give five stars was the very annoyed waiter who clearly did not want to waste his time with us. I'm guessing because we didn't order a bottle of wine or salads and appetizers? Or penal he is just always annoyed. That was the one major blemish on a truly phenomenal dinner."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant. The food is excellent and so is the service. Lots of great options for the entire family, an Italian family no less :) I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I don't eat Italian much but, I will be back here really soon. This spot has it all, great food, nice setting and great service.  The appetizers were nice but, the veal scallopini was phenomenal as was the penne.  The prices were reasonable for the high quality of the dishes.   Without question, the waitress was a 10. She took time to carefully explain each special and was meticulously careful when taking our somewhat individualized orders.  It's been a while since I had a server this good. Thanks, Diane.   Only one negative: valet parking was the only reasonable option."}
{"text":"We decided to try Franco's at about 8 pm on a busy Saturday night based upon reviews here and it turned out to be a perfect evening.  We were visiting Scottsdale for the weekend, in the mood for authentic Italian and Franco's did not disappoint. The service was personal and welcoming, including tastes of wine to see which we would prefer and menu suggestions that were spot on. Our son had the Chicken Parmigiana, not on the menu, which was probably the best version we have ever tasted. I was hoping for Chicken piccata, also not on the menu, and the waiter was more than happy to have it made for me. My husband had the sea bass, also delicious and both so fresh with perfect sautéed spinach.  We were ready to look at the dessert menu, when our waiter appeared with a plate of delicious cakes compliments of the owner, plus limoncello for the adults. Could it get any better than that? This is a lovely local restaurant with delicious food."}
{"text":"The cheesecake and chocolate cake are amazing! Make sure you try the lasagna it is absolutely incredible"}
{"text":"Great local place for authentic Italian cuisine. Very attentive service staff. Try the tutte mare excellent."}
{"text":"Intimate restaurant with fantastic fresh made pasta and steaks and fish.  This is not a lasagna and spaghetti and meatballs joint: this is some traditional Italian Italian food.  Fantastic deserts too."}
{"text":"A fantastic find. Happened in here one night and had a wonderful meal. Easily on par with my favorite Italian eateries in NYC."}
{"text":"Very good food and a great wait staff.  Franco was even there.  They had about ten specials the Friday night we were there.  If you can't find something you like here, you should go back to your TV dinners.  Only negative was that it was very crowded and rather loud."}
{"text":"Oh so good! From the minute you enter (atmosphere and personal welcome by whom I believe was Franco himself!) until the minute you leave, you will be happy you chose to come to Franco's. I'm a native Northeasterner and frequent NYC diner with a passion for authentic Italian food and Franco's lived up to my hopes! Buffalo Mozzarella \"special\" starter with a variety of other yummy items kicked it off WELL! I asked about the ravioli vs the fettuccine tartufo and they were so sweet to put both on my plate! Both amazingly delicious but if I HAD to pick one? The Tartufo, mmmmm! A lot of veal on their menu (I'm a vegetarian with a big soft heart for animals so I didn't care for that but it was an authentic Italian menu for sure!) My husband had a special for his meal and licked his plate clean. Celebrated my birthday here with a combo dessert plate of cheesecake and Governor's chocolate cake which were both fabulous. Started with great martinis and a superb bottle of wine. All in all, great spot! Definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet, authentic, delicious Italian meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing fettucini with truffles! The rest of the dishes were pretty good Our waiter disappeared for awhile and the room alternated from hot to cold over and over again but we enjoyed it overall.  Next time, I'll stick to the pastas."}
{"text":"A fantastic place. Was very busy, but the service was perfect. The owner greeted us. The waitress was very charming and attentive. We ordered and were pleased with the food presentation and quality.  Jim said that the sea bass was the best he has ever had. I had the homemade ravioli with tomato basil sauce. Dessert was excellent. A keeper!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious meal and a wonderful dining experience at Franco's! We would definitely dine here again! Superb service as well."}
{"text":"By far THE BEST Italian food I have had in my 23 years of living in Arizona! My bf had decided to do a date night here since we have probably past this restaurant over 100 times. We first came in and we were greeted/seated by a man that turned out to be Franco! The service was amazing and it was such a cute little spot in old town. Probably seats no more than 50-60 people, so it's a small place but it's a quiet spot. I ended up getting a mushroom pasta (I cannot remember the name of it to save my life) but it was a menu special for the night. This place beat oreganos, Olive Garden, brio, DeFalcos and every other Italian spot that I have ever been to. It is a bit on the expensive side but it is great for date night or just wanting order take out for some really great Italian food!"}
{"text":"I was especially happy to have been able to finally dine at Franco's because I've been trying to get into this restaurant for months!  But I always think of it too late and when I call for a reservation they're booked up. And Franco never fails to sound extremely disappointed and sorry that he can't fit us in. Nice problem to have. Anyway now I can see why. This place does everything \"primo\". They gave us a lovely plate of extremely good provolone cheese along with salami and soppressata on the house. I don't know if Franco sent it because it was our anniversary or because I told him that I'd met and worked with his lovely daughter Emma (we're both actresses) or if he sends this treat to everyone. I didn't query the other diners to find out (though I wanted to). But it was amazing! One thing I know EVERYONE gets is the basket of crusty bread and high quality, almost nutty olive oil for dipping. The wine list is also excellent and reasonably priced. Even the Caesar salad stood out, down to the quality of the bread used to make the croutons and the pepper. I don't think I've ever noticed such a difference in black pepper before!  For my entree I went with the pounded veal chop topped with fresh chopped tomatoes and herbs. I'm not usually a veal chop girl but this was pounded so thin it was like a cutlet. It came with a side of fresh veggies but for $3 more you can get a heaping plate of pasta too. Definitely a deal. I had the homemade fettuccine. Yum! My groom chose the Frutti di Mare special which included fresh tuna and calamari and was served over squid ink pasta. He is usually a veal chop boy so I shared some of my generous portion with him. For dessert Franco sent over not one but TWO desserts on the house, along with an anniversary candle. Awww. We got to enjoy some tiramisu and a dreamy cheesy family recipe concoction. I also had a double decaf espresso (which our attentive server David called a \"why bother?\") made with beans from the nearby Coffee Roasters coffee shop in Scottsdale. So awesome!  The only negative I can say is the bar didn't have the makings of a chocolate martini for me. But it's probably best I stay away from martinis anyway.  I cannot wait to go back! And maybe now that summer is approaching and snowbirds are leaving, I'll be able to get in even if I forget to make a res a week in advance!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my dad's 90 th birthday. We were 10 at one long table and it was comfortable and quiet.  The waiter and staff were very attentive.  Never have I been to a restaurant that has so many veal dishes.  Wonderful food and lovely service.  Everyone left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Franco is back! What a great evening! Enjoy his new place."}
{"text":"Really good meal with superb service!    As frequent eater of Italian food, I can vouch for Franco's.    I give the food 3.5 stars and the service 5.  For my entree, I tried the linguine with clams in a red sauce.  Pasta was cooked to perfection and complemented with fresh clams (which I always love).  While I thought the entree was good, it could have used a little more sauce and flavor...didn't see any fresh garlic in the dish.  In comparison to other restaurants in the area, the portion was on the smaller side but still adequate by all means.  But this is the case with most restaurants that pride themselves on the quality of their food instead of their portion size.  The restaurant has a good selection of Italian wines by the bottle and glass.  Overall, I had a great experience at this restaurant.  The friendly atmosphere and excellent service truly distinguish this restaurant from others.  Franco's is definitely 1 of the top 2 choices for Italian in the Old Town area.  This place is always busy and fairly small so reservations are highly recommended (especially towards the end of the week)."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food and service.  We were greeted at the door by Franco.  Felt like we were in the home of a dear friend.  Our server was amazing.  Very knowledgeable about the specials and the menu.  We ordered from the specials and were so delighted by the amazing food.  Since moving to Scottsdale 6 years go we have been searching for an authentic, unpretentious Italian restaurant and we have finally found one.  Thank you for making our first experience just the first of many."}
{"text":"Had a very wonderful dinner here this evening. The mozzarella is the best I have ever had and the lamb chops were amazing.  The service is very good and the staff are positive, friendly and knowledgeable.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a guest in town that requested Italian food for dinner. My husband found Franco's on Yelp and so off we went. A small but wonderful restaurant. The staff was very attentive and the food was fabulous. We had the charcuterie appetizer, that I highly recommend. We all loved our entrees. I will definitely be back for another great dinner."}
{"text":"This is a truly authentic Italian restaurant....coming from NY....this is the Italian restaurant in Scottsdale!!! Food was awesome...service was fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Great hospitality, fan atmosphere, very delicious food, we enjoyed every minute,  Franco the owner was very kind and hearty Make your reservation now:)"}
{"text":"we came here on vacation and this place is amazing. between 4 of us we all had something different between the ravioli, fettuccine, erbe and chicken contadino. We all  loved our meals. Homemade everything and Franco is so nice. Service was great as well. we will definitely be back next time we visit."}
{"text":"Great food & Best service ever!!!!  Another part already seated took a chair from our reserved table so we had to wait until another chair was available and weren't seated at reservation time.  But the host took great care of us while we waited because he felt really bad. We were very happy with the service and food!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this restaurant. Mr Franco himself came by our table to welcome us and also checked on us throughout the night. Read one of the news articles framed on the wall which indicated Franco had 4 other Italian restaurants in Brooklyn NY. This place is so authentic. Please, if you see a picture on their Yelp page and it's not on the menu, just ask and most often then not, they'll make it for you. My husband and I had both the veal chop with mustard mushroom sauce and chicken parmigiana (both of which were not featured on the menu). They were so delicious, flavors bursting in our mouth  Even if your full you have to try their mascarpone cheesecake- it's worth every calorie. Wait staff was the best, very friendly and attentive and made us feel at home. The establishment is on the smaller side so I recommend you make reservations. Again, this place exceeding our expectation and I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here for my husband 's birthday. They gave us a lovely table. My husband raved about all of his food. He had the chicken piccata. The birthday dessert was amazing. Chocolate cake and marscapone cheesecake. I had one of the specials, seafood medley on ink squid pasta. It was disappointing. The seafood was overlooked and too chewy. Pasta and broth had little taste. Ordinarily I would have sent it back but, since it was a birthday and he was enjoying everything so much, I didn't want to make an issue of it. We will go back and I will try something else."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ate here last night, and we both remarked that we were kind of sad that we'd never been in before, considering the fact that we live within a few blocks.  First, I want to rave about the authenticity of this place.  I felt like I was in a cozy Italian restaurant in New York instead of in Scottsdale.  What this means is that it was a little crowded and loud, but I kind of loved that!    We started with Caesar salads, which were very fresh and delicious.  I could have used a little more dressing, but overall it was very tasty.  For our meals, we both ordered pasta.  I had the tartufo, and I was so appreciative of their letting me make a couple of changes.  I ordered it without the olives and added shrimp, and it was AMAZING!  I could definitely tell that the noodles were homemade, and the sauce was perfection.  It was a cream sauce but wasn't super heavy like most, and how can you go wrong with truffles, right?!  The shrimp were delicious, and I'm very picky about shrimp.  What was even better was the fact that the tails were off!  I really will never understand why so many restaurants choose to leave the tails on shrimp.  My fiancé ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli with meat sauce.  The ravioli were impressive--plump and flavorful.  He thought the sauce was a little salty, but I thought it was great, and I'm usually the one who complains about salt.  The desserts looked fantastic, but we did not save room...next time!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service by Jack!  They had about 5-6 specials that evening, all sounded delicious.  Husband and I split an appetizer of:  mozzarella/tomato, roasted red pepper with white anchovies, ahi tuna, pickled artichokes and sliced beef tenderloin.  Fabulous!  We then split an entree of black linguine with seafood.  Franco's is small and energetic.  Will definitely go back when in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Maybe I had high expectations based on the reviews. The seating was very tight with others that really made it feel uncomfortable. They really need to space the tables out more. The dinner was pretty good. But nothing that had me excited enough to go back for. The service was also just awkward. Perhaps it was just an off night."}
{"text":"Wow...what a wonderful place! It was a bustling Saturday night but the service was impeccable, the food  fantastic, the wine spectacular, the owner charming, and the ambiance perfect. The pasta was to die for... freshly made and absolutely delicious. The quality can not be beat. The sea bass was so flavorful and cooked to perfection. The pork was tasty as were the side dishes. The meal was capped off by a great espresso and yummy gelato. Thank you Franco for a lovely evening."}
{"text":"Wow, the reviews were right. Loved this place!   Live in Oldtown Scottsdale so have tons of restaurants nearby - and many of them wonderful. Franco's was a place that I always wanted to go to but have never been able to get a reservation when I've called last minute. (Yes, I tend to procrastinate!!)  Thankfully, I finally got in! My hubby and I were definitely impressed and will absolutely return!  Franco was so kind and welcoming - no fakeness. We could see that he loves his business, his staff and patrons. Thought our italian waiter was exceptional too!  Great service (gave us space but would check on us at the right time), was knowledgeable  but non assuming (unlike many italian and french waiters Ive met at other restaurants at this caliber).   The food was delicious!!!  Loved that they started out out with bread and antipasti (these freebies have gone away from many restaurants which is sad since they really help start the night!).     Husband ordered pasta and refused to share since it was so good. Im always trying to eat low carb and healthy so ordered the chicken and shockingly - this was so flavorful and delicious - for chicken!!!  Because of the reviews, I started with the caprese and like the reviews said- it was also delicious. And they were kind to split it up for us even though we never asked for this.  A definite gem in Scottsdale and better than all the other italian restaurants within 10 miles."}
{"text":"Franco treated us with such warmth and hospitality on our honeymoon.  My husband's beef filet was the best he'd had in Scottsdale/Phoenix and my Halibut was perfectly cooked. Franco treated us to the most delicious bruschetta and creamy cheesecake and flourless chocolate for dessert.  We had a superior Italian red with our meal.  Our best experience dining in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"If you want to have an outstanding Italian dinner in a wonderful atmosphere with excellent professional service then you must go to Franco's Italian Cafe in Scottsdale, Arizona. There is simply no place better! Franco and his family are gracious hosts who make everyone feel at home in a beautiful setting. Their menu is wonderful and the food to die for. A must addition if you want the best Italian food in the Phoenix and Scottsdale areas.  Judy and Bob N Glendale, Arizona"}
{"text":"Best Italian I've had in Scottsdale. My girlfriend and I came in and the owners wife and daughter sat us and were so friendly and personable to us the whole night. We had the caprese, cheese board, bread with olive oil wine for appetizers. Then the piccata and lamb shank for entries were all awesome."}
{"text":"Franco's is the best Italian food in Arizona by far. The veal chop is the best I've ever had. The ambience and the service are unsurpassed. Franco is at the restaurant nightly and greets his guests with warmth and is a very gracious host. The Merengata and Cheesecake are amongst the best desserts I've ever enjoyed in my lifetime, really, really good."}
{"text":"\"Chef-owned Restaurant...and it shows!\"  As a seasonal resident of North Scottsdale, seldom do my wife and I travel the 30 minutes to Old Town. But let me tell you, we do now! Having been met at the door by Franco himself and graciously seated by same, we knew we were in for a treat. The atmosphere evokes memories of our multiple trips to Italy and a quaint, warm, and inviting ambiance.   The charcuterie and cheese plate brought gratis from Franco started our evening and we knew we were in for wonderful meal and experience. The service (done expertly by Antonio and John) demonstrated their knowledge of the menu, as well as their ability to properly describe the dishes themselves. And every special request was politely honored with a smile and a nod.  The caesar salad was superb, well balanced with each specific flavor able to be identified. Our main course was a special of rabbit ragu with house made paparadelle, which was quite simply one of the best dishes we have had since Italy. We completed our experience with the dessert of Merengata, Franco's grandmothers Christmas cake recipe, that takes him two days to make two dessert cakes! It was unlike any dessert we have ever had and worth every calorie!  Having dined at many Scottsdale Italian restaurants we highly recommend Franco's and encourage you to enjoy a wonderful dining experience here. As Franco's shakes your hand on the way out, you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed our experience at this quaint restaurant  with a lovely atmosphere. The food was delicious, with all kinds of original dishes! Our waiter Corrado was wonderful! Lots of great suggestions for entrees! We were celebrating my parents 75th birthdays and we were extremely happy to find this little gem to make the evening special!"}
{"text":"Why have I never heard of this place?  Stumbled in with a friend walking home and was graciously seated though I didn't have a reservation and clearly it was busy.  Exemplary service and reasonably priced wine and food for the amazing quality that it was.  Definitely adding this one to the date night list."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. But much too loud. If you want conversation with your meal, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me say I am a true east coaster who grew up in all Italian community. This was hands down the best meal of my life!!!!! When we got there Franco the owner brought us some nice prosciutto  and bruschetta. The bread was hard and crusty just like back home. We ordered the antipasto specials. It has fire roasted peppers. Prosciutto and melon, actual red tomatoes, homemade burrata, and phenomenal seafood salad. We spilt the seafood special Pasta as a second course. It was black in pasta , halibut, clams, mussels, shrimp, calamari, and sea scallops in a red sauce AMAZING!!!!!! For entrees my cousin ordered the  veal chop with ado glaze and mushrooms. Served with fresh veggies. I had the seafood risotto hands down best I have ever had . Franco they gave us two complimentary desserts and two limoncello. This is such a elegant amazing place well worth every dollar spent. They just earned a local customer !!!"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best Italian restaurants in America ... fantastically delicious food ... old school and attentive service ... excellent wine list ... great environment!!! I love this place - Franco is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here last night & our experience was fantastic! The food was delicious, the service was exceptional!    The owner Franco even came over to our table & was as sweet & pleasant as he could be.  We talked for several minutes about Italy & Greece.  The pricing was what we expected.  Our over all experience was 5 star.  We will be back when we come to Arizona in the future.    Thank you Franco for treating us like family!"}
{"text":"We took my Mother on the Saturday evening before Mother's Day and had a phenomenal meal as always. Amazing service and amazing food! Doesn't get any better. We started with the baked asparagus wrapped in prosciutto with grated Parmesan cheese and a touch of wine. So very good and enough to have 3 spears each with a nice amount of prosciutto. It went so well with the variety of delicious homemade complimentary  Italian breads on the table. My Mother had a all-time favorite the Fruitti de Mare with squid ink pasta, it is so loaded with an assortment of seafood that it's amazing. My husband had the rack of lamb which he loved, very tender meat and good sized lamb chops and came with polenta, sauteed spinach and carrots. I had the halibut that was tender and flaky with a light sauce and came with sides of sauteed spinach and carrots along with a roasted potato. For dessert we had Franco's perfectly made espresso and his delicious merenghata. My Mother's favorite always had been the tiramisu but after having Franco's merenghata she thinks she now has a new favorite. Between both the choice is hard to make."}
{"text":"I've only ever had Olive Garden.. but that isn't AUTHENTIC Italian food. Went here for a little get together & it was like stepping off the streets of Phoenix into little Italy. It's cute, cozy, and Authentic Italian. Majority of the staff is Italian and they are MORE than accommodating. The food was amazing!! Best I've had! They had wonderful wine choices & the dessert was TO DIE FOR! The owner, Franco, even shakes your hand and thanks you for coming to his restaurant. I had the best experience there! Coming here is like going to Italy without leaving Arizona!! I 1000% recommend coming to this restaurant for a date night or even a get together with friends!!"}
{"text":"I am still in disbelief how we were treated just simply opening the door. As we were walking in (we didn't even make it past the door) we were quickly approached by an older gentleman. He asked us if he could help us in a manner as if we did not belong there. We said we just wanted to have dinner. He hastily shook his head and said he couldn't do it. He lead us out the door without mentioning that you are required to make a reservation to dine there. He was very rude and seemed like he could care less about not being able to help us. I am very distraught how we were treated. I am an old town native and frequent very many restaurants in Scottsdale. I have NEVER been treated in such a poor manner. Very disappointed with the impression we were left with of this restaurant. I must also note that we looked up the restaurant before deciding to dine there, and their website did not state that a reservation was required."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would. I went here with about 20 people for my 21st birthday and it was the best restaurant experience I've ever had! The owner came out with a bottle of wine for me as a birthday gift and sang happy birthday to me with a play of assorted desserts! On top of that my group was late and him and the staff stayed an hour and a half to serve me and my friends! He and the staff are so personable and the food is amazing!! My friends and I are definitely coming back whenever we can!"}
{"text":"I've followed Chef Franco from his original spot in Scottsdale, to NYC, and back.  It's the best Florentine steak outside of Florence and his grandmother's heavenly meringue cake is never far from my mind."}
