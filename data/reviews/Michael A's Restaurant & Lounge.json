{"text":"We go here often and never had a bad experience. Very friendly atmosphere, they make you feel like family. Amazing food and drinks. If your looking for nice family dinner, I recommend Michael A's."}
{"text":"Food was ok... Service was ok, but the waitresses Lynn and Doddie were very unprofessional talking about their dogs tick bites and worms and vet experiences that should not be talked about when diners are dining. They also were complaining about customers and co-workers and their own opinions on things that should be kept quiet in front of diners. Even though they were sitting at the back table we could still hear them because there were only 4 other diners there and they were loudly discussing things. Also the loudspeaker that goes off to tell the wait staff to pickup their order is a bit loud and annoying. They need to find a better way to communicate. 

I would not recommend this restaurant and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"A traditional Italian restaurant - if you're looking for a restaurant that serves traditional Italian cuisine, this is the place. The food is old-school but very tasty - I had scallops and scrod. The decor is also old-school, but the service was great and it's just a very homey, comfy place to eat. I imagine the locals love this place. It caters to an old clientele. If I'm in the area again, I will come back and eat here again."}
{"text":"What I experienced at Michael A's was the most awkward and infuriating experience I think I've ever had in a restaurant.

The lady that sat us immediately asked us if we were using a coupon which I had no knowledge of. This is where I think the brunt of her stand-offishness and passive aggressiveness came from. My girlfriend and I are both young and she must have thought it wasn't worth her time to serve us. Our only explanation is kids are going in with a coupon and not tipping well. Who knows? I tip well and am very pleasant at restaurants.

I ordered a coke and it was only refilled once. She must have thought I had enough soda because she ignored the empty glass and instead chose to refill my tiny water glass one time. If she's worried about my health she should probably make sure my ounce of water is replenished more than once during the whole meal.

I ordered the spaghetti and meatball and received just spaghetti and sauce. She slammed the plates down and ran away not refilling our empty glasses of water which we put at the edge of the table for her to see. When she finally came back to give us our bill (didn't give us a chance to inquire about dessert) I told her I didn't receive a meatball. She said I should have told her... when?

She acted REALLY passive aggressive to my girlfriend for some unknown reason. When she asked for a box for the rest of her fettuccine alfredo she kind of tossed it at her while in full stride to another table. It fell right into her food. It was at this moment that I almost strangled someone for the first time in my life. The mental image you're creating from my description is completely accurate. I'm not trying to exaggerate it to get my point across. While quickly walking by she tossed a Styrofoam box at her food letting it fall into it. She didn't say a word or even look at us. It was the rudest thing someone's ever done to me.

Seriously, the entire meal was awkward and there was for the most part 2 tables occupied the entire time. If you want people to patronize your over-priced Italian restaurant you should hire pleasant waitresses. Don't go here if you value good service and not feeling like you're a huge burden."}
{"text":"It is not a destination spot, but I come here very once in a while for pasta night.  On one occasion, I came 27 minutes before closing and was turned away.  The pasta is ok.  The wedding soup and the salad are above average.  I still have a sour taste in my mouth for being turned away.   Laziness."}
{"text":"I love this place. There marinara sauce has become comfort food to me, I believe it's the best in Pittsburgh. The restaurant it self is the no frills family owned type, with mike sitting at the bar saying hi to all the costumers. My fav dishes are the veal parm , veal romano, wedding soup, pepper & tomato salad & his homemade cheese sticks. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Very good food, reasonable prices, and good service. Went as a party of four. Lemon sole, spaghetti, chicken piccata, and veal piccata. Everyone had good things to say about quality of food. Don't know why other reviewer thought it was overpriced but for this type of place I felt it was reasonable. You do have to climb stairs to get in to this place so be ready for that. Will go again."}
{"text":"My parents always raved about this place.......so we gave it a try........it wasn't so bad that I refused to pay the check......but I would not give this place a second try.....there was NOTHING to rave about.....ugh.......I'm not even gonna waste time going point by point from the salad, to the wedding soup, apps, the bread ! (hard as a rock)......and the sauce ? ugh......just not very impressed at all......place smelled funny too ( we couldn't figure out what the smell was......but it was odd).......on way to car, my hubby looks at me, rolls eyes and says \"wow, what a mess\" lol  It was classic......the meal?.....not so much !"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a map of Italy as your place mat?  

I can't say enough about the little gem called Michael A's.  It is spot on every time that we have been there.  It is not a fancy-pants italian place trying to sell you on some new wave dinners.  It is simple, original Italian fare.  Every week my mom would make home made red sauce, so I have some high standards.  This is one of the only red sauces that I will order out.  It is sweet, but not overly so and you have a choice or meat or marinara.  

There are may things that I enjoy about Michael A's but here are some highlights:  
1.  Sometimes Michael himself welcomes you (if he isn't in the front, he is making the food.)
2.  Each meal comes with a salad AND (Not OR, AND) soup (if you are ordering pasta.  Entrees come with a side and a soup or salad)
3.  The pasta is always cooked to perfection.  A little al dente, but never soggy. 
4.  The prices can't be beat.  My go-to spaghetti and meatball is $11.  Remember that comes with soup and a salad and bread is waiting for you at the table.  Entrees range from $10-25, and you leave full every time or fill up on soup and salad and have a meal to take home.  

Step outside the city for a fun date night in Old Italia.  (Don't forget the tiramasu)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic...very good, authentic italian food...every time I'm in I try something different and have never been disappointed...a must try!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We go all the time and have never had a bad meal. Casual atmosphere. One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"I can't say much about this restaurant as I was here for a rehearsal dinner.  But the waitstaff was super friendly and I highly recommend the Italian Wedding Soup.  The soup itself had a clear broth, but the little meatballs that were in it were really tasty and perfectly complimented the soup."}
{"text":"What happened to our beloved Michael A's?

It's been at least 15 years since we last visited and it was a huge disappoinment.

Things he's still doing right, the salad. What's so special about the salad you ask?  It's served room temperature. Perfect!

Marinara is still spot on.

That's where it ends.   The wedding soup was mush. The pastina was in the soup way too long.  As well as the spinach, or escarole.   No capers in the veal picatta. It also treated like they used flour in the sauce.  It was off.   Capers are required!

Service was extremely slow. They were understaffed to accommodate all the senior citizens.  We we're the only folks in there that were not AARP.  

I really do regret going here because I truly had great memories of this place with my family. 

Another thing, the servers, workers we really friendly to everyone, except for us. It was obvious we were not regulars, and we were treated as such.

Don't worry, we will never be back."}
{"text":"Disappointing in a nutshell...or clam shell.
I ordered linguine with clam sauce. The clam sauce was grey and looked like it came out of a can. No whole clams...minced, again as if from a can. Flavor was also lacking. Looked like a dog's dinner. They should just take it off the menu.
Another of my dining companions had stuffed portabella mushrooms that were flattened to pancake thinness. Weird.  
I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We live in Oakmont and can go to any of the great restaurants in town, but we keep coming back to Michael A's. The food is great, the family that runs it is super nice and the value for what you get is tremendous! Always get the House Dressing for your salads and you can buy it by the quart to take home. Magnifico!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here. If you like meat like I do, this is the place for you!  Their sausages are so tender and delicious! Also, if they have it when you are there, I recommend getting pasta fagiole.  It is delicious and for appetizers, get the buffalo wings. In my opinion, they are better than almost every other place. The time from when you order to when you get the meal is about 50 mins, but you have appetizers soups and salads to keep you satisfied. I recommend going here whenever you can. I'm just not a fan of the quiet atmosphere, but you can have a nice, social dinner here."}
{"text":"My family frequents Michael A's. We love the filet, chicken Marsala, chicken piccata, raviolis and fried zucchini appetizer. Great family friendly environment with legitimate Italian home cooked meals. Dinner comes with soup, side  and salad. Great value. I have never had a bad meal here! Love love love Michael A's."}
