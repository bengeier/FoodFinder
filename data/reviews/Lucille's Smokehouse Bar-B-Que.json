{"text":"Lucilles is really great BBQ, definitely the best in Vegas by far. They're located in The District in GVR and the atmosphere is really great, very southern. Expect an insane wait here on weekends, but it's well worth it. They have some of the best sweet tea I've had, served in a huge maison jar. The bread basket is stuffed with buttermilk biscuits and apple butter, and they have some really good apps like pulled chicken sliders on sweet rolls, fried green tomatoes with red pepper cream, and fried pickles (spears, not chips served with remoulade). They have delicious salads (one with sauteed shrimp, one with smoked salmon and a peach vinaigrette, one with BBQ chicken and onion strings). They have the usual meat platters with brisket, tri tip, ribs, chicken, etc. They have a good blackened catfish and some incredible sandwiches- my favorite is the BBQ chicken sandwich with melted cheddar, onion straws, and lots of field greens on a french roll (they also have yummy potato buns). Sides are awesome- good mac n cheese, peanut slaw, sweet potato fries, cheese grits, etc.  Mad props for being one of the few BBQ joints that also caters to vegetarians- veggie burger, salad, or a really good marinated portobello sandwich with melted cheese and garlic mayo. Desserts include fruit cobbler, pecan pie, peach bread pudding, banana pudding, and red velvet cake !! There is a separate take out area near the entrance that absolutely kills it. Service is great and prices are reasonable, especially given the huge portions and quality. This is the only place my husband and I go when we crave BBQ, and we often take out of town guests here for the great atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"First time here. The food was great loved the ribs the best I have ever tasted. Also the strawberry  lemonade delish. The only thing I did not like was it seemed that  our waiter was rushing us to hurry up. We were all still eating  he came over and asked if we wanted a box for leftover whhhat  is that!!! Then after we said in a bit,he came over again and asked if we wanted dessert while we were still eating :( other then that the food was great"}
{"text":"The service was slow. The food is pricey but average tasting. The catfish was undercooked and the chicken overdone. Won't go back."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Everything is delicious. Do yourself a favor and eat here ASAP. Had the BBQ  tri tip and it was one of the best thing I ever had. Also the service is amazing, Justin was a great waiter. If I was a inmate on death row ,this would be my last meal for sure."}
{"text":"I come for lunch and I have ordered BBQ chicken sandvich, I liked it very much, only it takes very long to bring food specially when you have only 1 hour lunch time"}
{"text":"One my favorite dining places in the red rock Hotel in my personal opinion better today no doubt this is the best restaurant get burgers I ordered the mushroom burger and it was the best decision I've ever made in my restaurant eating life is so goodthat after I was done my mouth is still watering I definitely recommend that you should come here and order the mushroom burger you won't be disappointed but it did take a while for the water to come so if you're thirsty bring yourself a water and welcome to the new age to the new age I'm radioactive radioactive"}
{"text":"best bbq ive had in vegas so far (ive had famous daves, and memphis champ.) I love the brisket and mac and cheese here. I also think the fries are good and my girlfriend loves the ribs. I think its a little pricey though compared to the other bbq places in town but its worth it. Service is decent, there seems to always be a wait but come hungry!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I ate the whole thing.

The great thing about eating BBQ in places in the South such as Memphis & Nashville is that I now know what good BBQ is. The bad thing is trying to find good BBQ in the Desert. Luckily a couple years back I was introduced to Lucille's  BBQ. Their food portions are great from your meal to your dinner salad or sweet tea you're gonna be set. Though not usually a Sweet Tea fan I always start things off here with one because they really have the mix just right and it adds to the whole BBQ experience ; )  They always hook you up with complimentary biscuits & butter which are very addicting if you're hungry and not paying attention. My Girlfriend ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer which is apparently a big favorite here and definitely worth a try. Then without warning a giant slab stockpiled with food is dropped off in front of you as you're informed that's your meal. I ordered one of many different BBQ combinations they offer and my plate had a Spicy Hot Link which is a personal favorite of mine at Lucille's, in fact I'll usually order it on the side if it's not included with my meal so needless I strongly back this item if you don't mind a little spice. Pulled Pork which was very moist & tasty, and BBQ Chicken which this time was pretty dry when usually it's excellent. The kid in me always has to get a side of Mac & Cheese and I went bananas when I found out they had sweet potato fries. The fact that the fries were amazing confirmed I was not dreaming. If you live in Vegas it seems that not enough places have/have good sweet potato fries so bonus points for Lucille's! but it's been 5 hours since my dinner and I still can't believe I ate the whole thing."}
{"text":"Was shopping around Tempe Market place and felt a craving for some good food. Low and behold we turn the corner and there is an BBQ plave that looks like it is inside a old train boxcar. We decided that this looked like a great authentic plave to grab a quick bite. The decor is fashioned from old school props wiyh mismatched chairs and tables. Not sure if i liked it or just garage sale junk they found. Our waitress comes over and asked it we ate there before. We say no and she explains the menu to us. She said the meat is slow roast everyday in house and flavorful. Looking at the prices we were a bit shocked especially for a lunch menu. $14 for a pulled pork sandwich and thats the cheapest thing on the menu. It came with 1 side and we both got garlic mashed potatoes.  Overlooked the price figuring the quality meat should be worth it.  Our drinks came in huge mason jars. The sweet tea was ok but I'be had better. The lemonade was way too sweet. Out comes our food about 20 mins later. The sauces were explained to us and i tried a couple of them but the werent good. The meat lacked flavor and was a small portion for the price. My bottom bun was already soggy and i jad to remove it. The potatoes were soo peppery that after one bite i couldnt eat it. I love garlic and this taste was definitely black pepper. I dont like to complain and rarely do but i really wanted a side and this was inedible. Our waitress was no where to be found and when she did come by my husband was almost done with his food.  I asked to have veggie instead cause i couldnt eat the potatoes...no problem she said she would switch it out. My husband then ordered corn bread cause he was done. Out comes his corn bread amd she said the veggies will be out shortly. The  cornbread was dry with really no flavor or sweetness. We finish and here comes the waitress with the veggies. She apologized and said the kitchen forgot about it. I asked for it to go since we were done. She brought it back in a box with our check. It came to almost $70 for a couple low quality soggy sandwiches and small sides. They double charged for the veggies and she said that shouldnt be on there and had to get a manager to take it off. Lowered our bill to about $60 not including tip.  I will not be back. Honestly the cheap chain restaurant Famous Daves is better. The price and quality dont match up here."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Valley!!  Been going to Lucille's since it opened.  I love the pulled pork sandwich and the BBQ chicken salad. We went last weekend for my birthday after we had a bad experience at Notorious P.I.G. in N Phoenix (terrible).  We ordered the super feast.  OMG.  It was $200 but could have fed close to 15 people.  We had nine.  It came with a large salad, biscuits and apple butter, 3 slabs of ribs, 2 whole chickens cut, 2 lbs of different meat options (we got 2 lbs of pulled pork and 2 lbs of tri tip (so delicious - my new fav), 6 sides (huge servings of sweet potatoes, cole slaw, fries, sp fries, corn on the cob and  mac and cheese) and we got sundaes for our birthday.  Everything was amazing and we had a ton of leftovers, probably a slab of ribs, a whole chicken, 4 corn on the bo halves, a quart of sweet potatoes, slaw and mac and cheese, pulled pork and tri tip.

I highly recommend this place to anyone.  I have yet to have anything I would not order again.  I would definitely recommend the trip tip and pulled pork.  The ribs are fall off the bone delicious.

You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am gonna be nice, but honest.  Service and ambience is good, perhaps above average. But the BBQ here is sub-par.  Not sure which city of Greenville Lucille grew up in (Wisconsin as stated by our server), but this place seems to try to grasp all styles of regional bbq....I had the \"Texas-style\" brisket and was truly disappointed.  I was recently in San Antonio and had true roadhouse bbq.  The first thing you experience is the smell of oak, hickory, mesquite in the air....not so much here, just fryer oil.  The meat had a good black crust and a nice pink smoke ring, but no smoke flavor.  As mentioned by others, it seems more like pot roast.  Tender yes, but Texas-style brisket, it is not.  

Beyond that the food was not hot upon arriving at the table...not sure how they pickup each order, but perhaps they need to rethink that process. 

Thats it.  Next time I go to bbq, unfortunately Lucille's will not be on my list."}
{"text":"Love this place but don't go here with a small appetite.  And be sure to make a reservation if you try to go on a weekend.  I usually get the half chicken, two meat combo which give me plenty of left overs for the next couple days. Their tri tip cannot be beat and I love their sweet potato fries.  I've also had the baby back ribs which are also amazing"}
{"text":"Loved the fresh lemonade ! The cornbread with apple butter and baby backs are my dads favorite . Once a month outing for us makes him very happy. Good service every time."}
{"text":"The service here was great! The first time we waited about 10 min to be seated which is to be expected in a weekend! NP!! After seated the food and the service was amazing! The second time no waiting and once again the food and service was amazing!! Try the salad"}
{"text":"My family and I went here after a doctors visit at green valley obgyn. I was actually in a pretty bad mood as I was told my baby is not ready to come at 40 weeks! Our waitress Katie was very sweet and had exceptional customer service!! She actually was a help with my mood getting better. Kindness goes along way!! The food was great but I was mostly grateful for the great experience given by a great waitress. Thank you Katie when we come back we will ask for you"}
{"text":"While not the best BBQ I've had, Lucille's is a pretty good chain when you've just got to have BBQ. The biscuits and apple butter were a nice start and the baby back ribs, brisket and chicken were perfectly smoked. The sauce was not overpowering which is often the case. You get two sides with your meal and our group enjoyed the fries, grits, greens and coleslaw. Waitstaff was very friendly and attentive and the overall ambiance, upbeat and fun. Nice bar scene too. I would go back."}
{"text":"Went here on Christmas and the wait was long. The waiter we had and was rude and he was HORRIBLE. Our food came very late and my brothers food came pretty late. I had ribs and it was ok and my dad asked for wet towelettes that you use to clean your hands with after you eat something messy. The waiter we had gave us DIRTY WET TOWELS.
This was on CHRISTMAS. NEVER GO HERE ON CHRISTMAS. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE EVER AGAIN. I recommend not coming here ever."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Lucille's on Father's Day and it was extremely crowded. At first when we called, they wouldn't take our reservation and there was going to be an hour wait. But we called back a little later and said they would put our name down since we were on our way. It ended up working our perfectly so our table was ready right when we got there. It was extremely crowded with a lot of big parties. And despite all this, the service was incredible! Our waitress did a very good job of continually checking up on us and the food came out promptly after we ordered. And even if the service wasn't great, the food was exceptional! I got pulled pork and corn bread and both were delicious! I tried some of the food my family ordered and that too was very good. Plus, our table was in the bar so we were able to watch the baseball game and the golf tournament. Overall, my family and I had a very good experience at Lucille's!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ I ever had from a restaurant! UberEats screwed up our order and as I was calling I tasted the food. It was So Good I lost the urge to complain. Watch out for UberEats, regretfully we did not get to try their App Sampler and didn't get to try the fried pickles or fried tomatoes which I am sure would have been amazing like the rest of their food! Next time we will order straight from Lucille's! Thank you for the amazing dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for some excellent BBQ yumminess, this is the place to be.  Everything is wonderful, from the bread with sweet almond butter, the tangy cesar salad to the ribs. Service is a hit or a miss, but for the most part I have had good service.  Ribs and sauce are the perfect combo of sweet and spices. I always leave this place stuffed.
FYI. We always get the full platter rubs with two sides. I think this is meant for one person, but me and hubby always share it. We both end up full and taking home a doggy bag."}
{"text":"The food is good, not great. The service wasn't good at all. I understand there being long wait times but most people expect when you call them and say the table is ready they won't have to wait another 20 minutes because the table is not ready. And the prices are way too high. I've had better BBQ for less and gotten more."}
{"text":"First time trying this place, and left much to be desired.  

Hostess staff attempting to use the southern drawl ..\"Ya'll\"... Just stop, this is Vegas, act like it and quit the stupidity.  The waiter also did another annoying throwback to Olive Garden and other large chain restaurants by squatting at our table to take our order.  I hate nothing more than trifle attempts at a larger tip thinking that such actions are welcomed.  Just take my order and take it well, do a good job is all I ask. Annoyance level - High.

I ordered the Hawaiian Mojito and my husband ordered the Dixie Sweet Tea.  These were the only reason that this review warranted the single star.  

We ordered the fried Okra, which obviously is a pre-packaged item that is simply dropped in the fryer at the time of ordering and not made fresh.  We did not mind so much, because it was not entirely bad.  

For our entrees my husband ordered the Po'Boy and I the Steak Sandwich.  His Po'Boy was overkilled by the bread, the catfish nuggets had no seasoning, the sauce on the sandwich had no flavor and the mac and cheese side was simply macaroni with cheese melted on top with no flavor.  My steak sandwich was completely overloaded with the peppers and onions and greens, the meat was extremely tough for supposedly being marinated the night before.  The Chiabata bread had to have been at least day old or older as it was hard as a rock and impossible to bite into.  I finally tried cutting the bread with the steak knife provided and the bread crumbled... The Baked Beans were edible.  The meat was inedible and my dog will be the only one to actually enjoy this meal. Of course, only after I take the meat and rinse and soak it before sharing with her. 

I could not get out of there fast enough out of fear of being sick from what I actually consumed of the meal. It is really sad, because we did enjoy the atmosphere.  This was a waste of money and not anywhere worth the price point.  We will not return, nor recommend to anyone. Nice touch at leaving was that tootsie roll pops were given in substitution of mints at the door. Do not waste your time or money at this place and save your stomach."}
{"text":"I really hate having to write a bad review, but my visit to this location warrants this.

First, I'll talk about the food. Overly priced, the portions were small, our biscuits were hard, and in general for the price, it did not seem worth it. The restaurant was almost empty, but it still took a long time for everything to come out. And we didn't order anything \"well done\" or anything that would be a reason for it to be so slow.

Service - Our server was nice and informative. But I saw him so busy running food to other tables, refilling drinks for other tables, even bussing other tables, it was hard to get his attention, when we needed things. I don't fault the server for this, it just seems unfortunate that a restaurant gives so many duties for a server when all they should be doing is working on customer service. 

Most likely won't be back. I tried the Green Valley location a few years ago and enjoyed it, but this one wasn't up to par unfortunately"}
{"text":"Probably the best barbeque in the Las Vegas valley! We first learned about Lucille's when we were attending one of UNLV wine events at The District in Henderson. They were one of the food vendors and giving out samples of their BBQ Tri tip. Wow! If what they were giving away was this good, we couldn't wait to try their menu. We were back there for dinner the next night and have been going there ever since.

Since they're located in The District, parking is always a problem in the evening but you can park at the nearby Green Valley Ranch casino and walk over--just follow the aroma of their smoker and you can't miss it. Another issue is because of their popularity there is almost always a wait to get in. If possible, make reservations on the phone or through their web site. This doesn' guarantee that you'll get seated at your scheduled time, but you will be ahead of all the walkups. If you have to wait, you'll be given one of their pagers and you can either sit in the small garden area or window shop while you wait to be called. If there's a band playing in the bar, try to get a table outside (if it's not too hot) or as far toward the back as you can. The band is usually playing too loud to have a conversation.

The wait staff has always been friendly even with the pace they're serving people. Drinks are served in Mason jars and are quickly refilled when getting low. While you're waiting for your food, you get to snack on fresh biscuits with their fantastic apple cinnamon butter. These usually go fast on our table, so we order a second round of them while we're waiting. Portion size for the dinners is large, so unless you're really hungry you might want to skip the starter. If you do, the BBQ Rib Tips are very good. Depending on my appetite, I usually order their Back Porch which includes a half chicken, tri tip, and choice of ribs. If I'm not quite as hungry I'll order a full rack of either the baby back ribs or the St. Louis spare ribs. Brenda splits her choices between either the BBQ tri tip or the beef brisket. All the BBQ dinners come with two sides and we'd recommend the roasted garlic mashed potatoes and the creamy coleslaw. The honey roasted peanut slaw and the mashed sweet potatoes are also good and we'll swap between the four on our visits.

All the meats are tender and flavorful. You can order them wet (with your choice of sauce) or dry. If you order them dry, you can choose between three different sauces on your table to spice up your meat:

* Hot and Spicy - tomato, garlic, hot sauce and hot pepper. Not as hot as Devil's Spit at Famous Dave's, but very good.
* Original - tomato, molasses, vinegar and spices. Sweet and mild, but with good flavor.
* Memphis - tomato, mustard, vinegar. Tangy with a bit of a kick.

This is one restaurant that we seldom have leftovers to take home--well, okay...we do take food home but that's only because we order another set of ribs to go.

This still is our favorite BBQ place in town, but because it's out in Henderson, we don't get out there as often as we'd like. Now we'll usually just stop by Famous Dave's which is a lot closer, their food is almost as good, and it's a bit cheaper. Lucille's has been touting a new restaurant in the Summerlin area for almost as long as they've been in Henderson. Their web site says it will be at the Red Rock Resort, so we'll finally have one a bit closer to us."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The beef ribs and southern fried chicken are so good."}
{"text":"Great service and food.

The tri-tip pepper sandwich (sans mayo - with barbeque sauce instead) was very flavorful.  Although, they were a little stingy with the amount of meat on the sandwich.  Regardless, I would certainly order it again.

My wife had a burger which was very good (and big).  

We didn't have any drinks, but the table next to us did and they were huge.

Overall we had a great experience at the restaurant and would go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent as usual. Best ribs, great sides. Exceptional service. Locational was very convenient for locals too."}
{"text":"Was a Feast of beefy goodness. The St. Louis ribs and pulled pork sliders were fantastic."}
{"text":"Sabina was our waitress. She was amazing! Food was great and service was prompt. Very pleasant experience"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I love the atmosphere and feeling you get just walking in is energizing! The staff is always friendly and the food! It's always phenomenal. Try the banana pudding....you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the brisket burger with fries. Fantastic waitress - Lahela really made feel welcome and special. Great atmosphere & yummy food."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed me yet as far as food. However the service wasn't as good as it has been in the past.  The place was dead and it took forever to receive refills on drinks.  Other than that my rating reflects the flavor of the food."}
{"text":"I took my friend to dinner here last night.  I had a brisket and portobello mushroom sandwich with sweet potato fries.  My friend had the brisket salad.  We arrived approximately 10 PM so the place wasn't too busy for a Saturday night. So the service was great.  The food was fabulous! The portions are humongous! I could only eat half my sandwich.  The place is still loud but I think if you can get past the loud music/people you will enjoy the food for sure!"}
{"text":"This was a first time thing, it was great. Great food. Tip: the appetizer platter feeds two."}
{"text":"Yeah it's kitschy, yeah it's an overpriced chain, but Lucille's is still a pretty fun place to eat - especially if you're with a large group. 
Unfortunately when I went I was on a Lenten diet so I didn't get to try the ribs...so I feel that I cannot comment fairly on the most important part of a BBQ restaurants fare - the BBQ. OK I cannot comment at all. 

Overall my catfish was pretty good, mine did have butter/garlic and was cooked fairly well (not LA catfish but what do you expect in a desert?). The sides weren't noteworthy.

What did impress me? The fact that they had both Anchor Steam and Lost Coast Great White on their beer menu. Mmhmm. It's true."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! The food is tasty, the atmosphere is fun and most importantly, the price is reasonable. I've sampled the roasted artichoke, BBQ sauteed shrimp, burned ends, rib tips and pulled pork sandwich and everything has been tasty! The complimentary biscuits with the honey butter are a nice way to start the meal. My tip is to go on a weeknight between 5-7pm to enjoy the happy hour drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing!!!! We were greeted and seated right away. Leah was our server and she was very attentive and kind. There was an older couple that sat next to us and they constantly bickered back and forth and still she remained calmed, smiled and served the couple. She was really a sweet heart, she's a keeper. My husband and I ordered the deep fried shrimp appetizer. It was so good we ordered another one to come WITH our meal. It was perfectly seasoned and the jalapeño tartar sauce was to die for. I also ordered the back porch entree which was loaded w/ a half bbq chicken, tri trip, your choice of ribs and 2 sides. The meat was seasoned, tender and cooked to perfection. The sides were ok, and truth be told I don't buy a meal for the sides so I was fine. It was so much food you really get your money's worth. My husband ordered the catfish and shrimp which was an absolute delight. I would suggest to use the same breading as the deep fried shrimp appetizer, it's a winner! Thank you for a wonderful meal and the great customer service. You have just made 2 loyal customers who will tell the world how amazing your food and customer service!"}
{"text":"First off, the strawberry lemonade was literally TO DIE FOR. The biscuits were out of this world especially with the apple cinnamon butter was the cherry on top. We ordered the spinach & artichoke dip (which is our favorite appetizer, we order it everywhere we go & this one is definitely in the top 2) I ordered the brisket meal that came with two sides. I chose the Mac & Cheese and mashed potatoes. They were delish. My boyfriend ordered the brisket sandwich & he was very VERY satisfied. Overall, the food was amazing. The customer service was pretty good as well. The only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars is because it was really hot in the restaurant and they didn't have a bathroom. Also, my food took a good 45 minutes to come. But other than that my experience was very good."}
{"text":"Happy hour on a Friday... specials from $4-9 and a wide variety to choose from is why we came here. 

Ordered the Memphis Pork Loaded fries and they were a large portion (more than enough for 2) served with topping of cheese, pull pork, drizzle of BBQ sauce, and green onions were my fav of the 3. Bacon Mac&Cheese had a nice creamy texture with a thick layer of crust on top. Blazin' Burnt Ends were topped with Jalapeños making these spicy."}
{"text":"I Finally had a chance to check out what all the fuss is about. Everyone has always told me that Lucille's has some of the best in town. Not that I wouldn't want to believe this, but I have had plenty of disappointments as of late. However this is not one of those. First of all, they have an incredible location in the District at Green Valley Ranch (an outdoor mall of sorts). What can I say, great environment, but the porch area is extremely loud and I had to notably raise my voice (which is not quiet to begin with) when talking to my server. Loved the fact that the water was served in standard Mason Jars (without handles). As usual we combined a couple of sampler platters so as to experience as much variety as possible. Ribs and chicken were right on. White meat was perfectly done. Chicken naturally has a slight pinkish hue to it even when completely done. As long as the juices run clear it is fine. I think most people try to eliminate any sign of pink and turn it into chalk dust. The tri tip was incredibly tender and still juicy even though it was served well done, but the fact that it was automatically served well done is a definitely a minus. We added a Hot Link for only $2.95! It was excellent, slightly coarse in texture, good snap, possibly indicating a natural casing and it had well balanced heat. The sides were excellent as well. Potato salad that obviously used a generous amount of mustard and was not too sweet (a little viscous though). Greens, Beans and veggies were right on (not too salty). The pulled pork was only o.k.. It was a bit dry and it seemed like they tried to finish it like Carnitas under a broiler before serving. Also I felt that it was \"too shredded\" kind of like a thin meat pasta with no hearty chunk to it. The Brisket was the only thing that I will say was definitely not good. It had great flavor, but was totally dry and was sliced into jerky size pieces (big minus for that). I give 2 of the 3 sauces a big plus. The mustard bbq sauce was right on. The hot bbq sauce was excellent and actually hot. However the standard sauce that they serve on everything was way too sweet, sickeningly so. It might work out just as well as a desert sauce. Speaking of sweet, they have fantastic biscuits served with compound butter (cinnamon and apple), but they also may fare better as a desert course. Overall Lucille's is a little more expensive by comparison, although it was a lot of food. We spent $62 for 2 with tip and that included a $5 off coupon, but you are paying for the environment and service as well. I'd probably give it 3.75 out of 5 if that rating were available. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"When I first wrote this review we had been here twice and I was not happy with my brisket while I still haven't given the brisket another chance I can say with ABSOLUTE certainly that we will keep coming back. I love love love the pulled pork sliders, my husband took a taste and loved it too. I love the fried catfish plate.  The tri-tip sandwich with pasilla peppers is out of this world.
My husband had the baby back ribs with potato salad, barbque beans and we shared a side of amazing fries our first time there. He loved the ribs and he gets the barbque beans EVERY time we go they are THAT good. Second time around he got his shrimp po'boy was excellent, the batter on the shrimp was authentic Louisiana style and was second to none. Third time there he got the Hot links sandwich, while it was good it didn't blow him away. Most recently he got the Jumbalaya which can only be described as AMBROSIA...food of the gods."}
{"text":"Lucille's Smokehouse kids ribs are awesome! Good deal and good taste. Service could have been better but the food was awesome. I would have given 5 stars but the prices could be lower! Great food, sub par service.  I'm from the south and this is the closet southern BBQ I've had since I've live in Phoenix, AZ."}
{"text":"Get the costco gift certificates and save some money. The Fried chicken salad for lunch was very good, but they only have it at lunch. Portion size are good, bbq chicken was moist and sauces on the table are good. late night happy hour was good for drinks at a casino that is a plus. but the apps were disappointing, fries were small, patio skins were way too cheesy, fired pickles were ok, irish nachos were good, house beer was good."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service!!! U have to go!! Try the biscuits and there Mac & cheese!!!!"}
{"text":"Cant get enough of this place! If i haven't been there within a month or so its def. time to get back in and get my bbq fix.  There biscuits and apple butter is a yummy free appetizer.  I love the fact the drinks they bring out are not the typical 12-16oz cups so i don't have to ask for refills constantly.  My fav. is def the tri tip sandwich and fries, also if you like ranch on your fries there ranch is very good.  Then to end any bbq meal right they give you a hot moist towel to clean the sauce out of your nail beds and between your fingers!   Yummy, after this review I may be getting me some bbq for lunch! :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I can't get enough of this place. Amazing food and amazing service. Highly recommend trying there baby back ribs. They just melt in your mouth. The patio is heated too so on a cold night it's nice to sit back and relax while watching people play around in the district. I also love the renovations!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Mediocre meal. My wife ordered fries with brown gravy and thought she was going to barf. It looked like... something that leaked out of an old man's butt. They mix A-1 and other crap in it. I was happy that they had a gluten free menu and gluten free beer. Prices were okay, the food was just okay, the garlic mashed potatoes were  the highlight, but not the ribs... which is kinda what they do, right. It is not a place I will return to, nothing special and it really could have been."}
{"text":"The other day I had a craving for a good pulled pork sandwich, which isn't necessarily a good thing considering there aren't many options in town. Luckily I work near Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ which satisfied my craving last time so I headed there for lunch. But while sitting at the bar I decided that I needed to write a burger review this week and I've had the same pulled pork sandwich the last 3 times I've been there, so I caved and did what I always do: ordered a burger. I figured it couldn't be all that bad, I mean, they should know a thing or two about meat right?

Lucille's is located by The District in Henderson along with a whole bunch of other restaurants I haven't ventured into yet and a bunch of typical retail stores. It's actually a chain, with only one location in both Nevada and Arizona, and several locations in California. I'm sure they're all designed and decorated similarly, with jazz-influenced and BBQ related signs, lots of booth seating and a bar. The menu has pretty much everything you would want venturing into a BBQ restaurant. They also happen to have several burger choices on their menu which is lucky for me I guess.

I went with the mushroom burger, which for some reason is missing from their online menu but is included in the full PDF menu you can download. Although I ate one of the two delicious rolls they bring out when you first sit down, I still went with the  1/2 pound burger which was a mistake. This thing is huge. The meat had great flavor and was cooked perfectly to the medium rare I always ask for. The caramelized onions and sautéed mushrooms were really flavorful and great, and there was an abundant amount of melted jack cheese to the point that I lost some of it during the course of the meal. The bun was a bit overcooked and dry, but ok until near the end because of how juicy everything was. The whole meal was quite messy like everything else I've eaten here, which is why the warm moistened towel at the end is much appreciated. Overall this was a really good burger, and I couldn't even finish it all because of the size and roll I had eaten before.

My skinny fries were not as good; they had a strong oily flavor like it hadn't been changed in a while, and they didn't seem totally fresh which sucked considering my meal was at the height of the lunch hour. I'm really starting to hate everyone's fries lately I think. It's a constant comment of mine, and really a stupid part of the meal that should be easy to accomplish.

The price is ok I suppose for a restaurant located in a dense shopping area as well as the size of the burger: $12.49 including fries. If the fries were an additional charge I wouldn't be as supportive of this. My meal with an iced tea came to $16.73 total; most could argue that this is still a bit steep for a single burger meal, but given the stipulations I just mentioned I guess I'll let it slide. I did complain about a different meal I had last week because of its $22 price tag, and I will still stand by my stance that that far exceeds the acceptable limit. My burger was more than good, and I will definitely recommend it, but this is a house of good BBQ so stick with the pulled pork sandwich or something if you're reluctant to spend that much on a burger."}
{"text":"The appetizer sampler was really good. It was great to have okra after a long day of work. The best part though, was the Beef BBQ Tips. They were just the right amount of smoky, and were so very tender. The greens were good, and I found I really liked their sweet potatoe fries, just the right amount of sweet and savoury.  I would definitely recommend it again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Lucille's BBQ at Red Rock Casino based on other Yelp reviews. 

Things started out quite well.  I was lucky enough to score a table quickly (less than 5 minute wait) on a Saturday night.  The server came by promptly to provide menus and get our drinks orders.  She came back quickly with our drinks and was ready to take our food orders. We hadn't had much time to look through the menus but we had some meals in mind so gave her our orders.

Turns out this would be the theme of the night - service was too fast. Not something you usually want to complain about but we felt that we were rushed out.

I had ordered  a salad to come before the meal. They brought the complimentary biscuits and the salad almost instantly. I managed to eat two forkfuls of salad before the main meal came out.  So I had to set aside the salad to eat the meal while it was warm (shame it was not hot).  I had only eaten half my meal when the server came by to see if we were ready for dessert.  We said no (as might be obvious from our half-finished plates)  - at which point she left the bill and took off.  

Overall the food was just fine - though not the best bbq I've had.  However, the service and meal timing was way off - which left a less than enjoyable dining experience.  Perhaps this was just a fluke so I woiuld be willing to try Lucille's again but I'm in no hurry to repeat that dining experience."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour on a Tuesday. It was lovely! The bartender was super friendly. The mojitos were great and the food so good. I want to go back and bring my husband!"}
{"text":"Its been years since we've been here. Service was good! The food came to our table fast and I forgot how big the portions are! I was surprised that the burnt ends salad was so good! 

We ordered: fried green tomatoes, burnt ends, beef ribs, brisket nachos, and a burnt end salad. The biscuits were tasty as well. 

Definitely had to ask for to-go boxes!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I ordered fried pickles, fried okra,  BBQ chicken, beef ribs and tri tip. Everything was good except the tri tip, a bit dry for my taste. The BISCUITS IS TO DIE FOR. I asked 4 baskets. Sooo yummy!!! They were so packed it took us 2 hrs to finally get out of there. It took them forever to bring us our food."}
{"text":"Went hear based on several recommendations from my friends who raved about this place.  I was let down by my experience here.  Ribs were NOT tender and on the fatty side.  Have not been back and don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'll admit it..it was my first time. ..and it won't be my last ;)
Eating at this Bbq heaven I say! !!

Ok, waitress was very lingering. .felt like she wanted to braid my hair and feed me every morsel of my food. .UGG..
Food was beyond delicious, wait time was a lil more than we had expected,  but my husband and I had no other obligations.
Because this establishment is still in its infancy,  im sure it will get better in time.
A word of business advice. ..hire older, well established staff for a brand new restaurant. .not the teen bops currently standing around in that beautiful new restaurant :)
With that said, I will be back. ."}
{"text":"We should all be boycotting this restaurant.
Our order came out wrong and by the time they told us they were going to bring out our food, the other member of our party was finished.
The glasses were not clean - my bourbon reeked of gin.
The manager was not terrific, he should be absolutely embarrassed by the poor performance of his wait staff.
Not a good way to treat customers.

{"text":"Located next to the Green Valley ranch shopping center, this is a pretty good BBQ joint. We should have known going in that we would get huge portions because everyone was leaving with doggie bags. We each ordered rib samplers and it was a lot of food since the meals included 2 sides and corn bread. The price was high but that seems to be the case with most places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Lucille's was a great lunch stop before we left for home.  Had a beer which was Lucille's home brew, (tasted like Boston lager). Got the lunch three meat meal. Tri tip, ribs and pulled pork with a slaw. It was gone when I was finished.  Got an appetizer of fried pickle wedges.  Caitlin got a quesadilla and the chicken was grrrreat.  Kevin got the tri tip sandwich. The only thing left was the sauce.  Renee got a salad with chicken it was never ending, but was very good.  Somewhere were I'd come back if I was in the Tempe marketplace.  Thumbs up"}
{"text":"We wanted to hang out at Tempe Marketplace and wanted BBQ and the band playing on Saturday night was a bonus. After reading the reviews, decided to try carefully try Lucilles. 
The reviews for appetizers were very positive so didn't order one. I ordered the Memphis style pulled pork sandwich 10.99, hubby got the regular pulled pork sandwich also 1099. So far service was prompt and friendly after the food it got much worse. We casually ate our meal saw her serving other tables. We didn't need anything so that was fine but then we finished and the waiting began.
I had half a sandwich left and hubby's drink sat empty for about twenty mins . She finally arrived with the check offered desert, a box for my sandwich and refills for my husband. I was thinking of getting another adult beverage but took too long for service. However, our waitress may have explained why the bad service. She said they work as a team, we could ask anyone in their black shirts for help. I was a waitress many years ago and remember some places pool the tips. So a server could be amazing but would have to share with the lazy servers. System doesn't work. I should note no other server stopped by or even made eye contact.
However, our sandwiches were amazing, the pork was tender and had lots of flavor. The buns were not soggy, the sauces were fantastic. My husband liked his plain fries and my potato salad tasted fresh and well flavored. The prices for the sandwiches aren't bad.  The everything else is crazy. They push the lemonade but way too expensive, rather have a beer for the same cost. 
They really need to fix the service and read the Yelp reviews. The place could be so much better and they should lower their prices or put a few more reasonable dishes on the menu. The sandwich and burger section that is reasonably priced. We will likely go back, but will not try anything new here. Lots of items sound good but not going to pay those prices to be disappointed."}
{"text":"What an all-around excellent experience!  Just thinking about it makes me feel good.  

We were part of the onslaught of people who were waiting at the door, when they opened for the day.  We were seated exceptionally fast, and our server did an amazing job of juggling the 4 tables that were seated more or less simultaneously.

A \"Muddy-Water\" (their version of an Arnold Palmer), served in a Mason Jar, was a bit on the pricy side.  But the generous portion, and prompt refills, took the sting away.

My pulled pork sandwich was one of the best that I've ever eaten.  'Melt in your mouth' is a phrase that comes to mind, but still falls short of the actual experience.

Oops, I almost forgot to mention the atmosphere.  From the giant smoker in the middle of the room - nicknamed Smokestack Lightning, to the tasteful mix of both old school and more modern blues, the atmosphere added to the very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Was hesitant to come here after YEARS of continued, consistent disappointment at GVR/District location. As much of a hassle as it is for me to drive here, I think it's well worth the mileage. 

The service was better than anything I've experienced in Henderson. EVER!

The atmosphere is better. 

The garlic mash actually IS garlic mash. I didn't receive rock hard biscuits, but piping hot ones which was nice for a change. I still prefer the biscuits I was originally introduced to in 2006, this newer version is lacking but at least what I was served last night was hot & fresh. 

The food was ok but the service & atmosphere made up for it. I'll be back."}
{"text":"A few months ago I wrote a review under a different account I've since lost the log in info for. As a result, I received a message from Lucille's asking if they could send me a $25 voucher for another try which I did not respond to.

On todays visit, I took friends from England here for lunch.  We were all plenty hungry and the smells emanating thru the parking lot didn't help. I said not a word to them about my prior 9 year history with this location.  This review is based upon our experience today, not just mine. 

We arrive at 1:50 pm & sat at a booth in the bar for an unreasonable amount of time just to be greeted. When we were, 20 minutes later, our server handed us 3 menus, plates, etc., yet there were 4 of us.  One left for the restroom during our wait, so its safe to assume our server never noticed us until just before coming over. Mind you, the bar was not terribly busy or near capacity.

Another 15-20 minutes later she returned.  We were ready to place our entire order.  After taking our appetizer order, she only accepted our drink order. Once the 4th drink order was spoken, and while she was still speaking, our server walked away.  We found that a tad rude.  My friends were not impressed.  Forget we are 40 minutes in without drinks, we found that interaction with our server to be quite rude & unprofessional. 

10-15 minutes later our drinks arrived & THEN she took our order: tri tip sammie, southern fried chicken sammie, lucilles salad, and a BBQ salad.  My friend who ordered the BBQ chicken salad was asked for a side choice & she chose peanut slaw.  When our orders arrived, she receives not the BBQ salad, but the BBQ chicken sandwich.  This explains the choice of side ask.  Not sure how our server got the two mixed up, especially when the salad was pointed to on the menu.

Fortunately she had the peanut slaw.  By the time we 3 were more than half way thru our meal, her salad arrived.

I am stopping my story here.  Essentially, our server, while quite nice, was just terrible. Not efficient at all.  We spent more time WAITING than we did eating. We should not have been there for more than 2 hours, an hour of which was spent waiting to be greeted & to have our drink order taken. I think the last straw from my friends was when the server apologized for not understanding their accents. Granted, some English accents are difficult to process.  Theirs couldn't be more understandable. 

The bread was warm and not hard as a rock, which was a nice change.  Unfortunately, my tri tip sandwich arrived at room temperature & was dry.  Fries were cold & overdone. Our server would have known this had she bothered to check in with us, but she didn't.

On a side note, I had a view of the kitchen. Food sat in the pass way longer than it should have. 

Sorry Lucille's.  You asked for a 2nd try and I gave you one. On my full dime. This time was clear: I shan't return ever again.  

As for our server. She never gave us her name or I'd name her."}
{"text":"It's been a few years since we ate here last.  In Lucille's defense - I am not a huge restaurant BBQ fan - I much prefer the delicacies that the sexy hubby chef produces in our backyard.  However - this is the restaurant my son picked so we went.

There are really no complaints about the food really - it was neither Ohmygoodness awesome or Boythatreallysucks nastiness.  Food was warm and tasted good - just not memorable to me.

Sons got a rack of babybacks, tri tip and brisket - they all enjoyed them.  Since I am going to have backyard bbq deliciousness tonight - Hubby and I both went for the NY Strip - they were delicious - just not mind blowing to me.  Our dinners came with corn on the cob - didn't enjoy the bruised parts all over it though.

What annoyed me though is a couple of things that had nothing to do about the food (Maybe I was just in a bad mood)...

1.) We made reservations and our party of six arrived about 15 minutes early - there were plenty of places for our party to sit and there was no other parties waiting - so why did we have to wait?  Once they finally got around to seating us they stuck us clear in the back - I just don't like the layout of the restaurant very much - the back rooms feel closed off from the rest of the restaurant and the small room we were in felt somewhat claustrophic and our party of six was crammed in like sardines - even though there were other places to put us.  I hate being squished!

2.) We were seated right next to the table that had our server's sister and boyfriend.  Guess who got the amazing service we should have had.  Our service wasn't horrible - I just felt like an afterthought.  She wasn't rude - just was more interested in talking to her sister and her date instead of checking in our her other tables.  Like I said she wasn't rude - just did the bare minimum of service - we saw her when she took our drink order, when she served drinks then immediately took meal order, the delivery of our food and when it was time for the check.  She did ask once during the meal how everything was.  The rest of the time it seemed like she chatted with her sister and her date. 

3.)   Like I said - maybe I was just in a bad mood - but why oh why every time we have gone here - we get seated near the large parties with annoying little kids - I have been there, done that.  I never let my kids screech to their hearts content when they were little - and the five year old - running around their table and screaming - Grrrrr!   

I am really not in the mood to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was great. Atmosphere awesome food comes with hair. Ordered a po boy, thought it came without hair but unfortunatly it didn't. Smoke house burger bun is soggy and so is the fries. JC WTF!  I'd rather grill at home. So sorry to give a sucky review. I was looking forward to giving a 5 star. Food is over priced and NOT WORTH IT UNLESS U WANNA LEAVE HUNGRY! I feel sorry for the severs."}
{"text":"Jessica was an amazing server. She got all of our food in a timely manner and was very kind. She referenced a delicious drink and truly made this night."}
{"text":"Very disappointing Thanksgiving...
Since my boyfriend & I couldn't make it home (Cali) for Thanksgiving this year, my consolation was being able to enjoy a nice turkey dinner at Lucille's. I was so looking forward to having smoked turkey with the sides (for me, it's all about the sides!). My BF's parents had made reservations for 6pm; imagine the anticipation, as the smoky smells that greeted us upon arrival were divine. 
Imagine also, the dispair I felt when the waiter informed us that they ran out of turkey AND ham over half an hour ago! WHAT THE WHAT?!? I then asked if I could order ribs or chicken and still get the sides-he said he would check-when he came back, he said no. He didn't even seem apologetic in any way, which was like salt on a snail...
In the end, I ordered something called MardiGras Chicken, which was just okay. At that point, nothing would have sufficed. Based on the fact that: 1) they could have told us about running out of turkey (the reason for being there in the first place) BEFORE seating us, 2) the sheer apathetic attitude & inept service from the waiter, and 3) no apologies from management--I'd have to give Lucille's a THUMBS WAY DOWN."}
{"text":"I met a friend from out of town at Lucille's Smokehouse Bar B Que. I definitely recommend going in mid-week. There was no wait and we got seated right away. The staff was super accommodating. Since it was such a nice night out, we asked to sit outside on the patio. Even thought there was not a server assigned to that section, they made it a point to make us feel welcome. Our waitress Kayla was super busy inside with her normal section, and every time she came to check on us, she greeted us with a smile and super friendly customer service. Not once did we feel like an inconvenience. She was a wonderful waitress with friendly courtesy and prompt service. The manager, Thomas, made it a point to be super helpful and friendly as well. He saw that Kayla had a full section and checked on us and made us feel so welcome. Our order was taken quickly and the manager even accommodated a special order due to a food allergy. Our food arrived quickly and accurately. We ordered the fried pickles for an appetizer. They were delicious. Our orders were varied and the manager and another server brought out our food so it wouldn't get cold. As soon as our food was served, Kayla checked in to refill drinks and see what else we needed. Towards the end of our meal, we were given warm towels. That was a delight.  They even split our checks at the end with nothing but amazing customer service. Overall, great evening with friends with wonderful customer service from Kayla and Thomas. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Wow, so this is what legit southern bbq taste like! Being from Hawaii, I've never really eaten true authentic southern bbq before. Just the crappy ribs and crap you get at Chili's. (barf) 

I love that your water comes in a ball jar! Their biscuits with apple cinnamon butter is delicious! 

My boyfriend and I shared the Half BBQ Chicken & Choice of two meats. We got the beef brisket and rib tips! It was a lot for one plate! It also came with a choice of two sides. We chose to get sweet potato fries and mac & cheese. They also had a choice of shoestring potatoes, veggies, corn, garlic mashed potatoes, etc. 

The chicken was half a whole chicken. It was very moist and juicy! The beef brisket was sooo soft and melted in my mouth. I didn't even need to add extra bbq sauce to it. The rib tips were my least favorite, most pieces were fall off the bone, but some of them were kind of dry and not edible.

In the past, I've tried their family feast which comes with pratically everything on the bbq menu and appetizers. We shared the Super Feast with 6 people and we could barely finish it all. I love the fried okra and deep fried pickles! mm!

We went pretty early on a Thursday evening so it was quite empty and we were seated right away. The other times I've gone had been later in the evening on a weekend night and the place is pretty crazy packed! They have a nice gazebo area that you can wait in.. if there is room. Service here is usually very good but on a busy day can be quite slow.

The price, amount & quality of food is well worth it! And their mango margarita is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Lucilles was great tonight.  I went in with my family and sat in the bar area.  There was a old school blues band playing in the background with the bowl games on.  All in all, it was a good vibe.  

Got the pulled pork sandwich and used the in-house BBQ sauce on top, it was very good.  My sister tried to order a shredded chicken sandwich but was told they do not have one and she will have to order shredded chicken sliders.  Not that big of a deal, but why couldn't the server just have someone put the shredded chicken on a bun and charged the same price as a pulled pork sandwich?  Anyways, the shredded chicken tasted awesome as well!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate to have to write a bad review but I need to warn the veggies out there.

I ordered a veggie burger tonight and there was a piece of meat on it :(

I picked up take-out, brought it home, and didnt want to return to fix it. I did call to let them know and the manager was very curteous, even offered a comp.

However I did learn that they grill the veggie burgers on the same grill as the meat. That's how the meat ended up on my burger. If this concerns you I don't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Delicious. Sure, it's at Tempe Market, which isn't exactly a culinary mecca, but the BBQ is solid."}
{"text":"I loved it! They actually serve sweet tea in a jar. And it tastes like tea and not sweet water. The biscuits are a tad on the sweet side, but still very good. The meat has very smokey flavor without the great sauces they have on the table. The baked beans had a surprising amount of flavor and I thought the greens were good. They are not spicy like our favorite Tampa BBQ place, but they were still excellent. I can't wait to go back and try their desserts. After our truly massive meal sizes, I could not have eaten another bite. Our server actualy thanked us for coming in, and shook our hands before we left. It was an overall great experience. Our only critisims were that okra should be a side, a buttermilk biscuit would be a good addition, and I'd love to order gumbo as a soup ."}
{"text":"Pretty decent BBQ, went here with my family for the first time. We ordered the platter and me and my husband both got the 2 meat combo. I had the brisket and pulled pork and he had the ribs and pulled pork. The pulled pork was awesome. My brisket however was a bit dry. I covered it in their Original BBQ sauce, which is excellent!! We were seated within about 6-7 minutes which isn't bad, we were a bit early for our reservation. 
+1 for our waiter, who was awesome and very attentive
+1 for their Original BBQ sauce
+1 for their pulled pork"}
{"text":"I take my team out  to lunch here once in a while. They are always able to accommodate our large group without much notice. Love the BBQ and the sides. Love the atmosphere. Food is well priced and we always enjoy the lunch menu."}

{"text":"*4.5 stars*

Whenever BBQ cravings hit, my husband and I go to Lucille's. We've been here a number of times and rarely do we have a bad experience. I would suggest getting here before you're absolutely starving because there's usually a big crowd and the wait runs from 20 min to an hour+ on weekends (obviously the busiest). 

The restaurant is sectioned off into several rooms and has a down-home Southern vibe to it, from the old-timey framed photographs and wall art, to the screened \"porch\" with the shabby chic bench. Once seated, we start off with strawberry lemonade in huge glass mason jars and homemade biscuits with apple butter...so yummy! 

We usually share the Combo Porch Platter (it has the right amount of food for 2 or 1 REALLY hungry person) with my husband getting the Baby Back Ribs, myself getting the BBQ Tri-Tips (the Pulled Pork and Beef Brisket are good too) and we split the half chicken. So delish!  Also, the nice thing about Lucille's is that there are 4-5 different BBQ sauces sitting on the table to choose from. The 2 sides we normally select are the mashed sweet potatoes and potato salad. I've sampled the BBQ beans, mac 'n' cheese, and the coleslaw and have found all to be sadly lacking.

We're almost always too stuffed to get dessert, but when we have ordered, we've gotten the Old-Fashioned Banana Pudding and the Peach Fruit Cobbler with vanilla ice cream. Skip the pudding...it was bland and tasteless. On the other hand, the peach fruit cobbler was heavenly! Sweet, flaky, warm crust with juicy peaches and cold vanilla bean ice cream...mmm-mmm good (drool) 

So, with a check of around $35 (when sharing the Combo Porch Platter), scrumptious food and lemonade, and left-overs that warm up great at home...Lucille's is #1 in our book."}
{"text":"After going back and trying the GV location a second time I feel they have upped their game. Better service all around now."}
{"text":"Awesome food... service was exceptional! Caitlin was our waitress and she was on it...good vibe, good selection and great service...definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ for vegas, but this place would NEVER make it in Texas or any other Southern state that actually knows how to make BBQ. The brisket tastes ok, but they don't even know how to cut it properly.  For the poor souls here who don't have a smoker to make their own BBQ go to Lucille's!"}
{"text":"Give this place another  try and it was delicious.  The service was great, and the beef rib was very tasty. The pork rib was very meaty and the chicken was very well cook, juicy and tender.  I will come back again and bring my family."}
{"text":"The food was terrible & me and my girlfriend was waiting for our food for 45 mins & my fries was cold and the fish tasted horrible and I'm from the south and they have no type of dirty south cooking I rather go to Burger King before I would ever go back there"}
{"text":"We ate here twice while at the casino. The food was okay a lot better than you would expect in a casino. The onion straws were very good"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for quick lunch.
Wrong answer. Server was prompt with order. Apolgized for delay. Got food 40 minutes after order with cold fries. The
BBQ was good. Portions very small.
Certainly will not get locals repeat business."}
{"text":"Apparently not all Lucille's BBQ's are created equal.  Our experience at this restaurant was so far off the mark, that even allowing for an 'off day', it was disappointing.  

Starting with a mix-up at the hostess station, and continuing through a server who went on break as soon as we were seated, and ending in forgotten parts of the order ... The service wasn't up to the higher standard set by the green valley location.

The food was good enough, but hard to judge fairly through the lense of a bad experience.

I'll give them a '3', on the belief that it must be due to a misalignment of the stars.  After all it's a chain restaurant - it shouldn't be too much different from all the others!"}
{"text":"Artichoke app not fully cooked. Very expensive for even a half a rack. Pulled pork sandwich ok but dripping with grease. Fried pickles very good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, I've spent the last 3 birthdays here that's how much I enjoy the food. Except this last time was very disappointing the service wasn't that great. The server wasn't on top of of their game I guess, and when I asked for help she wasn't very nice about it. She gave off a lot of attitude and I didn't appreciate it. It wasn't a very busy night so I don't get why we got such horrible service. That will be the last birthday I spend there! It was very upsetting."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is friendly and homey. The food is typically consistently, the service has not been. But in fickle vegas this is understandable. Great for families and visitors. Reservations mean minimal. Drinks are creative and have slight southern flare. Worth experiencing for Vegas sake."}
{"text":"Although I am a local, this was my first time at Lucille's.  Although the  food was tasty the waitress was rude, lazy, and looked unkept.  (Carolyn). We were there to celebrate my nieces birthday so we put up with her rudeness and did not say anything to her because I know she  wouldn't hesitate to spit in our food or drinks.  If we would asked her for something she would ignore us and if we asked again she would say I heard you.  If you are a server, remember  a little kindness goes a long way and the lack of kindness only hurt you and your pockets.  This review would have been a 5 if based on food along, but the servers attitude took it down to a 2."}
{"text":"Best Onion Straw for appetizer! D'Bomb And there Salted Caramel cheesecake great dissert"}
{"text":"Went here with the family during a spring break trip to Vegas. After a long trip to and from the Grand Canyon, we were all ready to eat. First of all, the portions are huge! My wife had a BBQ ribs appetizer (4 nice-sized meaty ribs), the in laws had southern fried chicken and a meat dinner and I had smoked salmon. We all agreed that the food was excellent! If you're in Vegas and you want some BBQ, go to Lucille's!"}
{"text":"I am a regular, and will continue to be but have to comment on this subject.

Bar/lounge at any other place besides Lucys = after work wind down, drinks and conversations with friends, relaxing before going home to the hustle n bustle of screaming kids at home.

Bar/lounge at Lucy's = screaming kids being sat 5ft away from the bar, noisy large family groups being sat 5ft from the bar, did i mention children 5 ft from the bar, isnt there a law about kids being in bar/lounges? 
No wonder why nobody from the always jam packed line out the door Yard House next door is packed, n Lucy's bar is empty most of the time...
The bartenders and servers are great n friendly so i keep coming but i come to unwind and not listen to screaming kids 8 out of 10 times, i am here at least 5 days a week, there is a big back room where they can seat these families.....

Venting :)"}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants!  We recently relocated to NW Las Vegas from the mid-west and visit Lucille's about twice a month.  We found out about the restaurant through multiple referrals from locals and tourists. We typically use the \"call ahead\" seating option and are seated promptly upon arrival.  Trying to find a parking spot is usually an ordeal as this seems to be a very popular area of Green Valley.  We especially like the Friday and Saturday night live blues bands.  The reason we keep coming back is the good ol' southern cooking!! We have no complaints about any items we have ordered and especially love the Sweet Tea (served in Mason jars) Southern Fried Chicken (breaded and fried like Grandma used to make) and the biscuits with apple butter!! Felt like I was back home!!! At the end of your meal, they bring warm wash cloths to \"clean up\" any sticky fingers.which is a nice touch!  We can't wait for the new location to open at Red Rock Canyon which is closer to our home, but in the meantime, we will continue to travel the 25 minutes to Green Valley!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had dinner there last night and we loved it! We have been a few times and it is our favorite bbq place to splurge if we don't make it ourselves. Drinks are always great and service very friendly. I am a huge fan of their BEEF ribs, some of the best I've ever had. Their sides and biscuits are exceptional. My fiancé had a BBQ platter, chicken was wonderful but the tri tip was on the dry side. The only thing that was frustrating was the small scoop of ice cream for her birthday we received. Usually restaurants offer one of their deserts. We will be back, we love it! Only down side is the inflated cost... A bit over priced."}
{"text":"Had great expectations from reading online and checking out the menu. I used my usual Bbq test where I have the brisket sandwich,  dry of course to allow for variance in sauces.

 Unfortunately,  dry was the answer I received. The chopped brisket could have been from yesterday as it was none too moist. The bun was nicely toasted and the \"mop sauce\" was pretty tasty. I chose Mac and cheese as my side and it was quite good.

I am in Las Vegas for one more day and as I am not yet willing to give up on this place, will probably give it one more try.

Your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Awesome place with huge portions. I like to go during happy hour and get a few appetizers to make a full meal, full of variety. Love the Strawberry lemonade, love the biscuts, love that Memphis BBQ sauce. So Tasty!"}
{"text":"First and last time here.  We had a great server, but found a hair in 2 different entrees.  They tried to charge us for one of the entrees that had a hair in it, and a salad that we never received.  The only good thing that tasted good was the strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"TL:DR crowd - served MOLDY grilled cheese, sub par service and still paid for 70% even though everyone lost their appetites and didn't eat half their food.

We've been to the GVR location of Lucille's before and had a lovely time with great food and fantastic service. 

No brainer when we wanted a great place to go for a birthday!

The Red Rock Casino Lucille's was much closer to where we are staying this time, so we chose that location. 

We called about 2 hours in advance for an 8:30 seating for 8 people. We were seated around 8:45. We watched them clean the tables and then stay empty 5 minutes so we begged them to seat us as the 3 younger kids were taking up space in the super small indoor entrance and causing some traffic flow issues. 

The waiter took our order about 10 minutes later. Drinks arrived and our shoestring onions (tasty!!) arrived 15 minutes after that. 

Our food trailed in 20 minutes later in shifts. We got 3 plates (and a salad that was an appetizer added to a meal) and then a few minutes later, 4 more trickled in. The birthday girl was last to receive her food a good 5 minutes after the rest of us. 

She had only taken a few bites when we realized one of the kids was chowing down on a MOLDY grilled cheese sandwich. 

We asked the bartender for a manager. She took 10 minutes to arrive. She listened to us then said she wanted to take the bread back to have the kitchen manager check it. Five or so minutes later, she came back stating she gave us a sizable discount and took the kid's grilled cheese off. 

The birthday girl ate two bites and the rest of us had half the food on their plates and didn't want to eat another bite. 30% off. Our bill went from around $160 to $99 and we have 8 people half full and one very angry kid who got a sandwich taken away from him. (The manager did not show us a receipt or tell us an amount. She had the waiter deliver it a few minutes later and we never saw her again.)

Subpar service and terrible quality control. Don't know if we will return because that thought will always be lingering. 

What a sad birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Their food is consistently good. Service is friendly and efficient. The only thing that is a little clumsy is waiting for a table to open, there are very few places to stand or wait, and it tends to get a little clustered. 
Of course that is a testament to the fact that the food is really good and it causes a log jam to get in.
I always get the tri tip because it is fantastic.
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Not very good food. Too much $$ for not a very good quality. Biscuits were hard, Caesar dressing watered down and sour. Not very exciting BBQ either. Despite all of that, Elizabeth \"Lizzy\" was an excellent waitress."}
{"text":"My favorite barbecue place.  Great service, usually, and I'm happy with the portions.
I usually order the steak sandwich, but I have tried other dishes as well.  The salads are great!  And of course the biscuits were yummy but they stopped serving them unless you ask."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Nice atmosphere too. Both the ribs and chicken were amazing! Sometimes with BBQ chicken it's dry from the grill. Not here. Tender and juicy. Corn chowder soup may have been the best I ever had. Fried okra, just like grandma used to make. Will be back for sure and will try to save room for dessert, they looked amazing as well."}
{"text":"Usually to get the best BBQ you have to find one of those \"hole in the wall\" spots.  Lucille's is an exeption to that rule.  Even though it's a chain restaurant it has that \"hole in the wall\" feeling.  

Although we did have to wait a bit even though it wasn't that busy, the experience was a good one.  They started us off with Biscuits and this cinnamon honey butter stuff that was delicious!  We ordered the fried green tomato's  which were excellent.  They were breaded and fried to perfection while the inside still had a bite to it!  Then we did the two meat meal; we chose the BBQ tri tip and beef brisket, partnered with the honey peanut slaw and sweet potatoe fries.  I gotta say, I don't know if it was what we picked or if it's just that good but it was some of the best BBQ and sides that I have had in a while.  The Tri tip melted in your mouth and the beef brisket had just a touch of chewiness to it that held up to the sauces and was quite nice on it's own.

Overall a great experience that I will go back for, just make sure to bring your appetite!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last evening for dinner because we had seen reviews that they had one of the best veggie burgers in town. I know, it is a bbq joint, but what can I say: we don't eat meat :) That being said, we really had a great meal and will be back. I got the portabello sandwich and hubby got the veggie burger. Both sandwiches were juicy and flavorful. We also got the spinach and artichoke dip for an appetizer and enjoyed that as well. Service was quick and friendly without being intrusive."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!! Nothing was cold, dry, or tasteless. The server Joseph did an amazing job and I didn't have to wait for refills or look for him to get me things for the table. Very glad to have a Lucille's so close to home. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here today & could not be happier. We had the sausage trio appetizer. All were great. Our waiter said they sell them at cost to take home & smoke yourself. Too bad we live on the east coast. Also had the brisket with homemade BBQ chips. Too much food to eat it all. I would go back in a heartbeat if there was a location closer."}
{"text":"I have never been to this location before, but i will definitely come back again. The food was quick and was great tasting. I got the smokehouse bbq burger and it is now my new favorite burger. My boyfriend got the BBQ chicken with rib tips and brisket which i tried and was delicious. The waitress was super attentative and friendly. The staff seemed super friendly."}
{"text":"Decent food, but the service is terrible!

We went to this location on their opening day, there was barely anyone in the restaurant around 11:00 AM, yet it took an hour to receive our food.  When we did finally get the food, there were lipstick prints on my friend's glass (none of us wore lipstick), which was absolutely gross.  The waiter was nonchalant, when he took the time to actually check on us. 

When we advised the manager of everything that occurred, she apologized and stated that they don't hand wash the glasses.  I've been to a number of restaurants that have dishwashers and I've never had fresh lip prints on my glass.

The food was average.  The meat was tough and dry, everyone at my table had different cuts of meat and we all experienced the same issue.  The sides were good.  All in all, this location did not compare to the other Lucille's I have eaten at."}
{"text":"Everything about this place reminds you of a small town BBQ places in the south.  Mason jars for drinking glasses, the decorations, and the smell.  You know you walked into a good BBQ place by the smell!!!!  Everything i have had so far on the menu is delicious!!!  from the biscuts and cinnamon butter, to the fried pickles, to the entrees, and dessert!  The only complaint i have is that it is a bit of a drive for me but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Lucille's is pretty good, although I'm a BBQ fan and would say that I've had much better.  This said, we really enjoyed our meal and if you are in the area, you should check it out.  I took the Sirloin Tips, which were delicious, and my sister in law went with the BBQ ribs -- she loved those.  My wife took the pulled pork, and that was probably their least successful dish (too dry and underflavored).  Many choices of side dishes and I really liked the peanut slaw and the corn on the cob.  Surprisingly strong wine list, although we ordered beer out of tradition...

Food came fast, huge servings, and we enjoyed sitting outside -- they use water spray to cool the terrace, so even in 100 degree heat it was very comfortable."}
{"text":"The night started out great. There is was a bit of line but they got us in quickly. We order the appetizer platter which the entire family enjoyed. We ordered some extra fried okra which was excellent. The disappointment came when the main meals came out and one of the meals was wrong. The waiter quickly said it wasn't his fault but the kitchens. Ultimately I don't care whose fault it was but that it is corrected. Playing the blame game is not the best look for a restaurant. They did pretty quickly get out the right meal and gave my father a free dessert for the error. I want to love this place because the food is always good but the service just always seems to have issues."}
{"text":"To start off, the Peach Moon was excellent! I love Blue Moon and this is a drink that takes this beer to a whole new level. 

Our server was Anthony was very attentive, my girlfriend kept telling me how cute he was. (Awkward I know) He suggested the tri tip and pasilla sandwich and that is what I ended up getting.

BEST SANDWICH EVER. We will be coming back asap! I also like this location more than the GV location. Much more open and friendly environment."}
{"text":"Service was great , biscuits took a while but was worth the wait , apple butter LOVE . I'm more of a John mulls road kill grill BBQ kinda girl but I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"The best BBQ usually is smoked out in a dirty pit dripping with grease and sweat and although Lucille's has the decor of a Southern-style BBQ joint, it isn't...but it ain't bad. The sugar biscuits and honey butter starts out the meal. I liked the lunch special combos although 13.00 is a bit pricey for what was given. I had the hot link and rib combo, which consists of a hot link, three ribs, one side and a slice of watermelon. I thought the portion was good but I wished I had only got the ribs (baby back). There are three sauces (Memphis, Original, and Hot/Spicy) on the table. The Memphis is tangy like a Heinz 57 steak sauce.The service was good and attentive. The sweet tea was not like the best I've had in Texas but still nice to see it offered. Although I have had better BBQ in Kansas City, MO., the ribs will have me coming back to Lucille's for sure."}
{"text":"Lucille's has the best beef BBQ ribs I've ever tasted (other than my own). The biscuits & cinnamon butter is so good, I always take some home & reheat later. The service is always great even if the place is full & busy, I always feel like I get great personal service no matter the time or day I go. Oh & by the way you can get everything to go!"}
{"text":"Always great food here... A little loud for my tastes, but good service and food. Catfish & Shrimp for me.. Come find out for yourself."}
{"text":"I was nervous to eat here because of all of the pork so I stuck to the deep fried food. The buffalo wings and fried pickles were pretty good but the sauces served with the pickles were amazing. The best part of my visit was the biscuit before my meal, it was served with a cinnamon butter and I couldn't get enough. Amazing! 

The manager was polite and my server was knowledge."}
{"text":"Excellent food, as long as you order the right thing.  

Cost is a little bit high, but the food I have ordered has been worth it.

Service is slow, granted the last time I was there was a Saturday night with a group of 18 people.  We waited over an hour, our drinks/bread didn't come out for 15+ minutes after we'd been seated, and then we waited quite a while for our food after that.

Service might be faster if you time things right and go in smaller groups.

All that said and done, I won't hesitate to return when I'm craving some BBQ!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. I CHOKED ON A CHICKEN BONE AND HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. In April of 2011 my husband, 2 year old and I decided to eat at Lucilles. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and had to pull a bone out of my mouth. It scratched the inside of my throat and I started swallowing blood. When I spoke with the manager  he offered me a number for the insurance office and leaned in toward me and said \"we like to handle these type of things with as little press as possible.\"Their insurance offices kept up with me for a few weeks asking me questions about my follow up with the doctors and then i quit hearing anything. Here is the picture of the chicken bone in my quesadilla. I hope that you notice that this is the very first bite of food. If you are worried about your health and the health of your child. Please do not eat here. CHICKEN BONES ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER!!!!"}
{"text":"I am promptly seated every time I go to Lucille's. The service is always fast and friendly and the food never disappoints."}
{"text":"For me, Lucille's is probably the best BBQ in Vegas.  I'm sure others will contest to that, but I never get tired of this place.  Live music every Friday and Saturday nights.  Brisket is always good here.  I like to get the Jambalaya Me-Oh-Mya once in a while."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Love the baby back ribs and brisket. Excellent sides as well. Don't microwave your to go box though, it will melt and ruin any leftovers you may have. Very upsetting after dropping good money on good food."}
{"text":"First, some positives.  Service was good, music playing (Stevie Ray, Keb Mo, etc) was great. Food was cooked well, hot, good presentation.  We've eaten here several times, but unfortunately, we've always been underwhelmed by the taste of the food.  Watermelon margarita with a float of ginger beer -- they didn't skimp on the alcohol, but it seemed they left out the watermelon.  The only thing we tasted was ginger beer.  Appetizer of BBQ Shrimp -- shrimp were good, and it would be great if you wanted shrimp in spaghetti sauce.  Not my idea of BBQ.  BBQ baked beans -- blah, no real flavor.  Sweet potato fries -- too much cajun seasoning, would have been better with just a sprinkle of regular salt.  Cole slaw was very good.  Brisket sandwich was pretty good -- hot, tender meat, but nothing special.  Lucille's BBQ sauces are not my favorite -- the original is too sweet.  We drive all the way across town to get here.  I doubt we'll be back.  It's not worth the drive."}
{"text":"UPDATE: We went back and tried it a second time and it was better this time. I had the Texas brisket sandwich and the boyfriend had the pull pork. Wasn't TOO sweet this time! The service and lemonade was still top notch! :)


Our first time here and being that I'm from the South(MS), I say it was okay. More like an everyday chain restaurant to me. Everything was extremely sweet in my opinion - the braised greens needed vinegar, Coleslaw was okay, the potato salad had no flavor at all, baby back ribs were tender but could use a bit more flavor and the corn bread was very very sweet and tasted more like a pound cake than cornbread. 

However, the strawberry lemonade was thebombdotcom and they give you hot towels after your dinner which is a . 

Our waitress was Savannah and she was super sweet!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The biscuits and apple butter spread is the best part! Def a place I like to go a couple times a year. Some of the best bbq in Vegas I think. If you haven't been here yet. You're missing out"}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Great Service!! The Cajun Chicken sandwich was fantastic.. Mac&Cheese to die for.. BBQ baby back ribs, Southern Fried Chicken, ALL delish!! Being a TX girl & loving my BBQ- this has become the only place in Vegas to go to. Highly recommend for the BBQ  & it has a well rounded menu for all foodies."}
{"text":"I love bbq and had been waiting a while to go this place, because I wasn't sure if it was a good restaurant or not. So I decided to visit recently and ordered a lunch dish with baby back ribs, chicken, and beef, with a side of mashed potatoes. My mother could make better ribs with more meat on them than what I had received at this restaurant. The sauces were disgusting and the waiter didn't even bother to give us biscuits even though they were complimentary. I tried the chicken, but it wasn't anything as expected and was definitely not up to par, this being a bbq restaurant. I didn't even try the beef and for three people we ended up paying around $65 with the tip for a very unsatisfied lunch and setting. I will not come back to this place of establishment."}
{"text":"So I went back and tried Lucille's again. While the food was not excellent it was an improvement over the last time I was there. I had the ribs this time so perhaps it was just because it's hard to mess up ribs. The customer service was definitely different. I had a very nice server who actually took the time to chat a bit and really make me feel welcome. She was on top of things without crowding me and was just overall very polite. Again this is not super great food but I appreciate the effort and the changes I saw upon returning."}
{"text":"This is the best place for BBQ~ not only is next to Green Valley casino~ It has these screened room's sorta like backyard patio style! 
The ribs are out of this world, baked beans and corn on the cob!!! 
I like the beer selection here it's served ice cold & there lemonade is screaming good!!! bring an appetite... then hit the casino~"}
{"text":"The appetizers and sides are delicious! In terms of meat and sauce....I say Famous Dave's has them beat on the pulled pork, chicken and ribs. Coleslaw is fresh and yummy but I prefer the extra kick Famous Dave's slaw offers with the horseradish. The rib tips were great as long as there wasn't too much sauce on them. The deserts looked amazing but we were far too full to try. The biscuits beat corn bread any day! If you're at the Red Rock Lucielle's or The Yard House is the way to go for sure."}
{"text":"I used to really like Lucille's.  The food is good, the service is quick- However the last time I was there a few weeks ago we had the most obnoxious waiter.  I will never go there again because of the way he was acting.  He knew he was going overboard too because at the end he apologized and explained that \"not everyone always gets his humor\".   Because of this guy I 'm sticking to Famous Dave's from now on."}
{"text":"This restaurant has wonderful food, however anyone who decides to eat here needs to factor in very bad service to the experience. Do not go to this restaurant if you are hungry or have some place to be. Average wait time inside the restaurant is hour and a half, average wait time if you call ahead to pick up is 40 min. longer than told on the phone. Everyone understands the need to wait for good food, however it is unacceptable to be told your food is ready and then forgotten because of horrific communication skills held by the employees."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for BBQ. Service was great and couldn't be more pleased with the food, Wife NOT liking BBQ she decided to try it and was blown away. Highly recommend it. Kid friendly too."}
{"text":"There is nothing worse or pisses me off more than not getting  your correct food ordet from online or drive up window. It is so aggravating when you get your food to your final destination you discover you have something in  your bag of goodies that you either did not order or they gave you the wrong food but in Lucialls case i did not get what i checked in the online menu options. How difficult is it to read the exact same menu and get the customer the item they selected on a menu they provided for you online. 

I should have suspected things would get screwed up when I first made a phone call to find out if they had any dinner specials. A girl answered in a Valley Girl., Kardashians stupid ass voice and said \"uh dinner yes we are open for dinner\". No I said do you have any rib dinner specials.  Again same voice like she just walked into the world of humans\" Uh yes we have ribs\"  I was so frustrated at that point I just hung up and decide on the online option. 

Lucalls offers a great online experience. It is the rest of their process that needs improvement. . So with apprehension I ventured out for the first time with the online process. It was very intuitive and easy to complete the order. I received a confirmation email and a time that my order woud be ready. So far everything is perfect and exactly what you would expect from an online ordering process. 

Assuming  everything i ordered is in the bag and casualy looking into the bag ,  I can see everything looks fine all food present and and accounted for. U get home and the nightmare begins when I take the food out of the bag. 

1) They gave me the wrong salad. I ordered the Wedge and received a token house salad, I requested Blue Cheese and received Ranch. 

2) I requested Green Beans with the St Louis rib dinner and received Collard Greens and Baby Back ribs. 

3) The 3 miniture Shrimp and 1 shred filet piece of  Catfish dinner should be classified as an appetizer not as a dinner.

4) The Cajon  Pasta dinner was the only good item that I ordered. IT WAS VERY GOOD AND THE SAUCE WAS EXCELLENT WITH THE LINGUINE. 

5) The ribs were Ok , nothing very special. If they would have given me the correct St Louis ribs I don't think it would have been any better. 

6) Customer Service 
When I had dinner there a few months ago at the bar, the bartender was excellent service was excellent very friendly. I would go back and eat at the bar. Not sure if I ever want to talk to the people they allow to answer the phone.

ALL THAT FOR $74.00 and no customer service other than someone did not read my selections from the online menu or check for accurancy. . I would probably go back for the pasta dish it was exceptionally good."}
{"text":"Best service ever!  Food is great love everything about this place!!! We will be back... I will always ask for Ethan, though everyone we encountered had great attitudes!!"}
{"text":"After reviewing this place on yelp.  The owner contacted me.  He offered me a gift card.  I went back today.  However little had changed.  The biscuits were not very good,  the rib tips were fatty and filled with bones. The burnt ends were fatty as well.  Compared to the henderson location they have alot to work on.  It was very nice of the manager to offer the gist card and the service was good however I come for the food.  So I must be honest."}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ. I suggest their Baby back ribs, Chicken, and Beef ribs. As far as sides I suggest the Corn on the cob and Grits. They have great complimentary bread and sweet apple butter and they brew fresh down south sweet tea. Great place but a little pricey and the wait can be long so make sure to dedicate some waiting time once you get there."}
{"text":"Mmmmm BBQ... so good. Great spot in Henderson to really pig out on some well cooked meats. Wonderful ribs, I always get a full rack of baby backs (26.99 vs a half rack at 23.99... seriously just pay the extra $3 and take any you cant finish home people!!!) The sweet tea is also a favorite of mine. Chicken wings here are ---Spicy--- and delicious. Creamy coleslaw is something I will also order and pick up from here it is so wonderful. I've never had a bad experience here service wise. Only thing holding this place back from a 5/5 is that its just a generic kind of chain, it doesn't have that extra umph or character to set it apart especially in this unique town.

If you want good BBQ and are in Green Valley, I don't think there is anywhere else you should go."}
{"text":"Went here last year to celebrate my brother and his fiancee's wedding. There were so many of us it was hard to count. The waiters were fine, kind of scattered everywhere trying to accomodate everyone. I think we had a catered dinner. My lemonade tasted actually fresh and cool. It wasn't too sugary which was a plus. The cinnamon rolls in the beginning were deliciOus! Then we had an array if ribs, chicken, mash potatoes, mac n' cheese, salad, etc. The way it was cooked was good. I really enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Just okay there is much better BBQ IN VEGAS.
I prefer Rollins.
   I had the baby back ribs and they were on the small side. Tasted okay."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to give this resturant a try since it's been years since we visited this location. It was just average. We sat outside and it seems it's our luck that we always get seated by a big table. The server was nice obviously not his fault. We ordered a half order of the fried pickles. They were good nothing spectacular. As we were waiting it's always frustrating when another table sits down after you but gets their order before you? It's not like we ordered anything extravagant. 2 sandwiches and a kids grilled cheese. So after I addressed this with our waiter he stated it was the sausage sandwich I ordered that took a minute...ok give me a grill....whatever! To say the least the food was bland. I so wanted this experience to be better but it was not. So sad but probably will not be back."}
{"text":"This joint doesn't fail. Happy hour until 7pm is not a bad deal either. I ordered some Mai Tais and it's yummy. The portions are big, I ordered Cobb salad and I can't finish it. I've been to other branches and their ribs are the best, must be the special sauce that they use. Will definitely come back when we go to Red Rock!"}
{"text":"Talk about good eating,been twice want to go back. Ribs so good had the leftovers and biscuits for breakfast.All sides are excellent  the mac and cheese better than homemade. Only place you can find good sweet tea"}
{"text":"My husband  and I met some family there for a nice Sunday lunch. The place was busy and full of life. We were seated near the kitchen and the smoker, which was awesome, as we were able to watch the going-ons at Lucille's! 

I ordered the watermelon iced tea, unsweetened and it was so refreshing. My husband ordered the Black Porch Strawberry Lemonade. A delicious combination!

The portions are huge and a fair price, so bring an appetite! Our waiter Jose, was very attentive and did a great job waiting patiently as we ordered and asked questions.

Save room for dessert, because the carrot cake feeds two and is scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Ordered the beef smoked brisket. It was amazing!  And I thought they only had good brisket in Texas. Also purchased some BBQ which they gave to us free. Oversight? IDK."}
{"text":"The starter biscuits and apple butter were awesome!!! They were sweet, flaky and fresh from the oven and they come with the meal! We all loved what we ordered. You get what you pay for although the prices seem high. The atmoshere was very fun and clean! Live music is advertised for the weekend (Saturdays). I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Really good BBQ, ribs, salads, burgers, sandwiches and dessert. They appear to put a lot of time and effort into their meat preparation and you can taste it. Trio of house BBQ sauces at the table: hot and spicy, original and Memphis - all delicious!

Drinks in mason jars (great if you are usually in need of frequent refills). Yummy assortment of sweet, unsweet, watermelon and peach teas. Also, a variety of unique libation choices - including their own blonde, ales and hefeweizen and house made wine).

Rolls and cinnamon butter WAY TOO GOOD. Can't go wrong with banana pudding in a mason jar to close out the meal. They use team service and they get it right!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Ate here for Father's Day and fell in love. The food isn't rushed, the flavor is explosive, and the strawberry lemonade that comes served in old fashion mason jars is UNBELIEVABLY GREAT! 

The atmosphere and service was also a major major plus! I'd recommend eating here for any occasion. Very reasonably priced menu might I add."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Savannah! We had an awesome time. Good bbq and fried food, but the service Savannah provided takes the cake!"}
{"text":"Our party ordered an appetizer, sandwich, and platter with chicken, baby back ribs and tri tip. The pork belly appetizer was good although the picture on the menu was deceiving. The actual plate served is 1/3 of what it shows in the picture. The sandwich was good according to the person who ordered it. The platter was disappointing. The ribs were dry and the tri tip was tough and also dry. The chicken was good. 
I would not go back to this place. Not worth the prices you pay for dry food.  The strawberry lemonade was the best part of the meal. The server never came back for refills."}
{"text":"I went to Lucile's last night with my fiancé and our kids. I was really craving GOOD BBQ..that being said..I shouldn't have came here. Tough Tri-tip..over cooked ribs. Cheese grits tasted like powder cheese. My daughter hated the alfredo. On the bright side..my girl liked her drink. I'm gonna pass in the future."}
{"text":"Huge props to lucilles!! Had my son sleeping in the car, I explained my situation and they did impromptu car side service so I didn't have to wake up my kiddo. That's amazing service! Needless to say the food is amazing, but what continues to top the charts is the awesome grubbing and amazing service that comes with. Thank you, Lucilles!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, food was over priced. Almost $13 for a pull porked sandwich. I'll stick with Tom's and Famous Dave's. Don't waste you're $ or time."}
{"text":"Significant disappointment. We used to really like eating here. They have taken okra off the menu for one. Our baby back ribs were dry and some were really fatty. Service was just okay. Last time for us."}
{"text":"As a Southerner from North Carolina, I had some issues. First, the food is not that good (more details to follow)... Second, the restaurant was described as a mix of various Southern flavors, that probably don't necessarily all go together (e.g. the grits). Third, as a black person, the \"art\" (i.e. black people outside mowing lawns and picking cotton... I may be exaggerating, but they were doing some type of yard work), is a bit much, especially next to portraits of Billy Holiday, etc.

Food (3/5)
To start, I had the fried pickles, which are spears and not slices... the breading was good and the ranch dressing was on par with other restaurants; however, the mustard was interesting, for sure. The biscuits are delicious, but I couldn't help thinking that the added sugar on top is a bit unnecessary, especially when you're having a Sweet Tea. In addition, I had the half barbecue chicken which was tasty, but a tad on the dry side. The rib tips were served about lukewarm and equated to about maybe 2 oz of food, while the pulled pork was not flavorful, and definitely lackluster. I first ordered the cheese grits, aka the pimiento grits, because that's what they taste like... I also ordered the garlic mashed potatoes, which in my opinion, had too much garlic. I like garlic, I do, and I use it in almost every dish I cook, but they just weren't all that good. I suppose I expect food to be as good or better than if I cooked it, but perhaps my expectations are high.

Eventually, my sides were replaced with Macaroni & Cheese and the Baked Beans, which when eaten together, were pretty well seasoned. The beans were probably the highlight, and the mac & cheese was served steaming hot, but lacking salt. I finished the meal with the banana pudding, which was good pudding, but just that. Traditional banana pudding has layers with vanilla wafers, that have sat in the pudding and are soft, with yummy ripe bananas, but this was just pudding with freshly cut banana and crispy vanilla wafers topped with whipped cream. :(

Service (2/5)
I did talk to a manager during my meal because I could see the server was \"in the weeds,\" so I took my issues (not with him) but with the food, to her, but either way, he was not very good. Maybe he's new, not sure really, but I definitely have tried to make eye contact with him for the last fifteen minutes to order my dessert, but he has not walked this way as of yet. He dropped off the check earlier, but I mentioned at the beginning of my meal that I would be for sure trying the banana pudding... 'tis a Southern classic. As I'm typing this, I've watched him cash out three tables, and walk by a number of times. My plate is pushed away from me, and I keep looking around, but I'm literally in front of him, so he can't help but see me. As to his service previous to my food issues, I had literally just taken a bite of the pickles when he stopped and waited for me to respond about the quality. With my mouth full, I had to say something to get him not to wait and stare at me blankly for a response. In addition, he never got me a refill, that was the manager..."}
{"text":"My coworker had heard of this place and we decided to try it while we were in town. Oh my! This place is incredible. The brisket was moist not dry like most places. The cheddar and bacon sausage was also delicious. Chicken had a great flavor and the biscuits and butter were to die for. Service here was also great,  my drink never ran out. I am here fairly regularly for work and this is now on the rotation every time! Thanks for a awesome meal!"}
{"text":"I've been living out of town for the past few years but visited Lucille's again recently and I have to say that is still one of my favorite eateries in LV.  Good ribs, and always good service."}
{"text":"Love this place-- but it does get VERY pricy for dinner. Lunch prices are good. Food is phenomenal. Go here quite often for work lunches. If you do eat here, be prepared to want to fall asleep afterwards. Will make you very tired. The sugar biscuits are free with every meal and it comes with apple cinnamon butter-- SO good. I get the pull BBQ chicken burger with a side of a loaded baked potato and sweet tea in a mason jar. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place. It blows eveyone else away the memphis sauce is amazing.  The pulled pork sandwich is to die for and lets not forget about the deep fried pickles yumm!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed by this BBQ place. Just driving up to the place you can begin to smell how good it is. As others have mentioned the service was very friendly and the portions are huge. I think most rib plates could be shared. I came once with my parents and my dad and I got 2 different kinds of ribs and mom got chicken. Everything was really good and portions were incredible. Had to take a bit home. 

I've noticed it can get a bit crowded in the evenings especially as temps warm up as they have wonderful patio seating. It never seems to be a place for a quiet evening as its always a little noisy. Its great food for the price though and I would definitely go there again and again."}
{"text":"had an Easter lunch there today and i have not tried their burgers before and had a basic cheese burger and was very good, had that backyard bbq taste, wife had the bbq chicken sliders and they were great. always a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is great!  Tri Tip w/a side of mop sauce is TERRIFIC!  Biscuits and apple butter are awesome!  I'm getting hungry writing this review."}
{"text":"The waiters and waitresses here are always really nice everytime I come here and they answer any questions you have. This restaurant is a lot of fun and their food is amazing !!"}
{"text":"This place is usually packed on the weekend so we went during the week. I ordered the fried green tomatoes and they were so good! The waiter was friendly and attentive. My family ordered sandwiches and a baked potato with brisket. Everyone was happy with the quality of the food and the prices were decent. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"We visited the location in Henderson, NV and totally enjoyed the experience.  The food was delicious and our server, Ryan, was polite, friendly and extremely professional.  The whole visit was definitely worth it!!"}
{"text":"It started off promising... BBQ smell was amazing and had my mouth watering. Got some wings as an appetizer. They came out fast but were really bland and lack that BBQ flavor I was craving. Next I waited for my brisket... and waited... and waited. An hour and a half later I got my food and it was flavorless.  They wouldn't even comp my appetizer for the wait. I will NEVER eat here again. Such a shame"}
{"text":"Huge gobs of fat in the brisket salad.  Seriously, huge gobs. The rest of the salad was good.  Grits were very good.  The waiter didn't offer to remove the brisket from the check. I tipped 15% because it wasn't his fault, but did I mention the huge gobs of fat?"}
{"text":"Pricey BBQ for less then good food.

As a Texan I try not to be too critical of BBQ outside the lone star State. But this is a place that put their money  in decor not the food. You will not leave here satisfied. I tried  it twice to be fair but it was the same at each location. The brisket sandwich I ordered looked like pulled pork with no flavor. The sauce, also not  great.

Feel  free to dine here but I tried to warn you.

(Famous Daves is a five star compared to here)"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. 

Probably not your sort of \"classic bbq\" place. Some will dislike it for being a chain.

We love it because the beef ribs are incredible for dogs. We would give the rib bones to our dogs, who would chow down on the ribs!

I personally thought the food was great. It is the only restaurant I know that serves apple butter, which was delicious."}
{"text":"This 59 year old California boy says Lucille's is \"The Bomb\"!!!  Had the beef ribs...Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ places I have eaten at nationwide. What is there not to love about this place? Every meal I have ever ordered has been superb. I have been there many times. Apple butter, yum! Sweet potatos, yum! The bar has a fun atmosphere too. Sometimes they have live blues playing."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here and my first time ordering delivery from BiteSquad.

OK first of all: OMG!! This food is amazing!!! OK maybe that's all I have to say....
It's amazing! The BEST banana pudding I've had since my grandmother's kitchen! And the steak and mashed potatoes we're beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"Don't be a dummy like I am and take the server's advice and upgrade from a half rack of baby back ribs to a full rack for an extra $3.00 unless you can seriously consume a half a pig in one sitting.

SO MUCH FOOD. HUGE PORTION SIZES.

That's awesome if you're local and can reheat, but for out-of-towners like me on a business trip, it's a bit too much.

Good sweet tea and amazing greens. The mac and cheese side was delicious. So was the artichoke appetizer. It's worth the drive out of Vegas if you've got a rental car. The can easily accommodate big groups, just make sure you give them notice that you're coming.

What a find."}
{"text":"Visited this location for early dinner a couple of weeks ago with friend. After being seated in an area where I only saw families with children, I asked one of the hosts if where I sat was specifically designated for families. His answer was: \"It's based on server rotation\". Which was BS. A bold LIE. My friend and I were the only adults without kids seating in that section. 
Food was not as good as I've had at other Lucille's. Onion Straws were very salty and greasy.  We order Baby back ribs dry with sauce on the side and they were NOT served as requested.  Will not visit this particular location again."}
{"text":"This place is not too bad!  I normally don't like chains, but I've found that Lucille's is pretty consistent with their flavor and quality of their ribs.  I like their roasted corn, and their shoestring fries are fantabulous!  The service is always friendly (in a chain-sorta way) and I like grabbing a couple tootsie pops in the way out.  Before I discovered Buzz BBQ, this was my go-to place for barbecue!"}
{"text":"I love Lucilles . Their chicken is wonderful. The bed pudding is great and the service and atomosphere are also great. I would go there over and over."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bbq place in the LV area. The hot and spicy bbq sauce is one of the best Ive ever had. I highly recommend the tri-tip sandwich."}
{"text":"I really like place. Nice vibe, cool decor.
I like that they have live band.

Food:
The biscuits and apple butter are 'the bomb'. Don't forget to ask for it lest they forget. 

The mojito is sweet and minty. Very good.

We ordered the beef ribs: good and smokey but fatty. Tri tips were tender and delicious, highly recommended. We ordered roasted peanut slaw which complemented the BBQ, and some veggies as well. I advise to skip the salad, very ordinary and expensive for extra $5.99. 

The bread pudding is huge, and one of the better ones I've tasted. It will be dry without the sauce, which was very yummy by the way with a hint of orange zest and nutty flavor. 

Service is slow, food took a while to be served, it's a good thing there's a live band. 
Our server was attentive and nice and kept checking on us throughout our meal.

Overall, great experience and highly recommended"}
{"text":"My sister lives in Texas and says it was the best brisket she has ever eaten. The tri tip was tender and succulent. The garlic mashed potatoes were amazing and we loved the crisp, fresh slaw and light, tender biscuits. Service was great. Can't wait to try the bread pudding if I am ever hungry again."}
{"text":"Had the Beef Ribs- dinosaur-sized bones and five was plenty! Wife had a really nice rack that night. The ribs were good too! I kid! 

Other than the price, totally awesome place. On my Go Here/Don't Go Here scale... I say go here."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it. The ribs were awesome and the pasta was good, too. The only thing that would have made the pasta better was if the chicken that was included was actually cuts of chicken breast. It was weird that the included chicken seemed to be meat that was pulled from the bone and placed into the pasta... weird, but true.

Either way, that didn't kill the mood. Awesome setting, tremendous waitress, and I could've drowned myself in the peach lemonade lol."}
{"text":"This is the best South-Eastern style BBQ that I have tried so far.  I am more partial to Texas style, but this one is very good.  Had to ding them for a star because the BBQ sauce had a slight molasses taste to it (perhaps because it is South-Eastern style) and I thought it was slightly pricey (but it was in a casino).  The burnt tips are really not burned (that is a good thing) and are the best I have ever tried, including Texas style."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Food was also great. I got the brisket nachos which were yummy. Also the two meat platters are perfect entrees. The baby back ribs fall off the bone and the brisket is really good. Burnt ends are also amazing. 

Oh yea and the biscuits they give you with that spread is delicious. I took some home from last night and had it with coffee this morning!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to relax and have some good BBQ food. The servers here are very friendly and do a good job. They give you big glasses for your drinks so you don't have to worry about refills that much. The food is good portion sized and they give you tasty biscuits. One of my favorite places to go after a good lift."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is good. Not great but good. The chicken has spices I don't really like. The ribs, pork and brisket is good. What makes this place a four on my review is the fact that they offer very good fixins . the cornbread, okra, beans, Mac n cheese and their buffalo wings are all very good.

I like the location and atmosphere here. Good eats."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a ton of times and never had a bad experience. I personally enjoy the St. Louis ribs. There is a nice selection of sides to choose from and the sweet rolls brought to the table are an unusual, but pleasant, compliment to the upcoming savory meal. I've even ordered their take-out which is really nicely done."}
{"text":"Their website was very easy to read. I ordered their food from online. Their delivery is super fast and the driver was super friendly. Will keep going back."}
{"text":"So friggin good!! we ate here and it was absolutely wonderful... i got tri tip and my bf got the baby back ribs..the main dishes, sides, and dessert were melt in your mouth good, not to mention a great setting and excellent service as well from our waiter!!! We will be back for more!! 

Its a pleasure to spread the word about this fine establishment!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ in town. Their peach lemonade is out of this world. Yum!"}
{"text":"So maybe I've been spoiled growing up with good BBQ as well as traveling to the BBQ meccas like Memphis, Texas, and the Carolinas, but I was not very impressed with this place.  I went tonight with my parents, as it was their last night in town and Yelp said this place was supposed to be good.  Service was fine, right up until they got my parents order wrong.  It took so long to remake their order that we ended up canceling it because I had already finished eating by that point, that's how long it took.  Can someone explain to me why it takes so long to make dry ribs and \"dry\" pulled pork?!  It was ridiculous.

Now on to the food we actually did get to eat.  The chicken wings were probably the best part of the dinner, we got them dry, and they were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, excellently done.  The rib tips were ok, nothing special, but it was nice that they weren't to fatty.  The brisket was so smoked that there was barely any beef flavor there, mainly just smoke and bbq sauce, which made me wonder... The hot links were pleasantly spicy, but for some reason the casing didn't have much \"snap\" to it.  I had trouble piercing it with my fork.  I did like the sweet tea that I had, it was served with mint which was nice and went well.  Also like that they served the tea in a mason jar.

On the whole, I would give the food 2 stars, but due to the service and everything else, 1 star or less.  I will not be coming back to eat here unless dragged."}
{"text":"I was sooooo pleased with my experience here. The serving and wait staff were super friendly and helpful with their suggestions. And the food was amazing. All we had were desserts and an appetizer and the quality and presentation were great. I can't wait to come back and enjoy a full meal here. I am definitely suggesting this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered take out and when we got there the take out lady stated out order was never put in and we had to wait an extra 40 min while she stared she had to replace our order. You think she would've given us a complimentary treat or comp'd some sort of the meal but no. Anyways we went home and are and first off the corn bread was dryer than bark and had way too much corn inside it reminded me of corn on the cob. . The meat was way over cooked and drenched in bbq sauce. I ordered a well done brisket burger and was cooked medium and I can't stand any pink in my burger. My wife ordered a pulled brisket sandwich and she said it tasted way too sweet and sugary . Oh and by the way they serve you rocks (biscuits) with a sugar butter. Tasted like I took a spoon and took a bite of pure flour. The mac n cheese looked like mashed potatoes and was very mushy. The mashed potatoes tasted way too garlicy. I'm just happy we had a gift card and ordered for take out because if I ate there I'm sure I would've been more miserable and would've definitely said something to the waitress. Anyways if anyone wants real bbq I suggest Rollin Smoke bbq. Best bbq in Vegas in my opinion."}
{"text":"We had 7 pm reservations on a busy Saturday nite (The college football championship was on Monday). They took us right in. Our wait staff was busy, but professional. I couldn't decide on what to order, so I ordered the Back Porch Special so I had ribs, chicken and tri-tip and two sides. I was only able to finish half (partly because the free biscuits and the apple butter. I am looking forward to visiting Phoenix again, so I can eat there."}
{"text":"Cold shit, is how I would describe the meal. Ice cold prepared sides they left under the warmer. Wanted a drink until we watched the bartender pulling olives with her bare hands. Maybe if we weren't white the hostess would have treated us better instead of throwing the menus and silverware on the table and walking away. Then again the entire staff was rude."}
{"text":"Lucille's so damned good, makes me wanna slap my mama! This is MODEL Bbq

#1 All time fav place to visit when I hit up Las Vegas. It's worth the sometimes 1 hour wait if you don't have reservations. Never fails I always order: Smoked BBQ half chicken, spicy hot links, beef brisket, mac n cheese, candied yams, with home made biscuits & apple cinnamon butter.  All for the low-low price of $21.99. Dessert: Banana pudding. The meat is savory & melts in your mouth, the ingredients are always fresh, and their customer service is excellent. I make trips to NV just so I can get my Lucille's fix ;-). They give you so much food, that it's enough to last for 2-3 days. I'll be glad when they hurry up and open the one in Concord, CA, so I can stop making fictitious \"business\" trips to Henderson for some BBQ."}
{"text":"Awesome barbecue awesome service just a real awesome place would recommend it to everyone great sauces brisket extra thick come try this place u will be impressed guarantee"}
{"text":"This is a smashing BBQ place.  I've been a couple times, had the baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket.  All are fantastic and served with plenty of mop sauce to sweeten the deal.  The sauces here are excellent.  I believe one of their sauces makes an appearance in the Bloody Mary, which was one of the best I've had.  Service is always great.  Stop by!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect restaurant to keep in you're pocket when no one in your party is sure what they want or can agree where to go.

If you like quality BBQ, this is an excellent choice. It has a down home country feel and a southern BBQ flavor. They start you right with sugar biscuits and apple butter. The southern sweet tea is served in huge mason jars. Plus there is a variety of sauces to choose from. 

The menu is extensive. Having been here many a time, I've tried everything including appetizers, salads, non-BBQ items, and specialty drinks. I've never been disappointed with taste. Portions a sizable for food as well. But as far as drinks; the cocktails tend to be small and weak so if you're in the mood for drinking, stick to what's on tap."}
{"text":"Overpriced!!!  Someone needs to teach management the meaning of value...  The BBQ is not bad, but on a lunch special of $13 I got 1 beef rib and 1 chicken leg/drumstick.  Don't even get me started on the iceberg lettuce salads for $11...  Again, BBQ not bad but not worth the price..."}
{"text":"I have to say that I really like Lucille's. I love the fried pickles and they have the best veggie burger. The mac&cheese is good, but its a little heavy. The fried okra is great if you're an okra fan. They have good iced tea and pink lemonade that comes is huge mason jars so that you never run out of something to drink. The restaurant is huge and they have a large outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Loved their customer service even though the food was pretty decent but their service got me the most. Was here for a bday dinner:)"}
{"text":"Yo this place is so good. do yourself a favor and eat here. They have huge portions and it's decently priced. If I could eat Lucille every day I would."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could. I had a large party come in that was ready to spend money and because it was close to closing, the staff was talking crap about my party. Instead of telling us that our group would not be sitting together they just prepared the table and argued with us when we asked why they didn't tell us. They were rude and inconsiderate. The restaurant missed out on a $600 plus sale."}
{"text":"I dont wanna waste too much time with this, as its a chain restaurant. However, it is the only one in all of AZ, and I thought it was better than Famous Daves...

I played it safe and went for the Pulled pork sandwich. It was tender and moist with the requisite smokey flavor. It came with a decent amount too. I slathered mine with their hot bbq sauce and pigged out. It was good, You'll be fine with this.

Co-worker had a platter with ribs, pulled pork and smoked chicken. I tried the chicken and was surpised how moist and tender it was, replete with a delicate smoke flavor. I wouldnt even put anything on the chicken, it was that good. 

At this point, I was mostly convinced that these items were actually smoked and prepared on site, at the restaurant. Forgive my skepticism, but real bbq takes a long time. And chain restaurants dont have a lot of credibility, at least not with me.

Skip the cheddar grits - Stick with fries for your side. 

Bonus tip - avoid ordering beef brisket anywhere outside of Texas. You'll live with less regret."}
{"text":"Christmas Day

We went seated with a 15 minutes waited I noticed they were busy which I didn't mind. As soon as we got our table the server asked if we needed something to drink from there we waited. I noticed she made us wait for a while before she even offered if we wanted appetizer. She went ahead help the bigger table before we got to order our meal not only that she didn't even asked or check on us to see if we where ok but she was focused on the bigger table which I totally understand. Good was great and everything we always tip the server big because they are usually attentive but this time around I really didn't want to tip her but I felt bad so I still have her a bit. Sometimes you gotta pay attention and treat people equal because who know the person will tip you more."}
{"text":"Biscuits are delicious! Who doesn't love something covered in butter and sugar? The corn chowder was just okay - was expecting it to be pureed and creamier, but was just pieces of corn in a soup (try the corn soup at Spago and you'll never be disappointed!!!). The portobello burger was good and the bbq sauce was just okay - wish they had a mild sauce with a more hickory/smoky flavor. I was not impressed the cheese grits - they were not creamy or very flavorful (needed more sharp cheddar and liquid to make it creamier). I went with a very large party of 18 co-workers, and while the waiter seemed a little flustered by our party size, he kept up fairly well with our orders. Overall, it was a decent experience and it was great they were reasonably priced and had vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant three times now and believe I can now post a review: This is a pretty good place for barbecue. Pretty good.
So if you are in the mood for a pretty good meal AND you like barbecue in general AND you don't mind eating in a restaurant that is excessively permeated with wood smoke AND you don't mind paying prices that are more suitable for really good barbecue, then Lucille's will  suit. 
As I said, the barbecue is pretty darn good. The side dishes are mixed. The baked potato, which I have had three times has always been room temperature--which in summer is cooler than outdoor temperature.
The staff is pretty good as well. Somewhat attentive, almost giving off a sense that they care about the fact that I have chosen to bring my family to dine. But not quite. The Prices are high for both the quantity and quality of the meal. Not outrageous, but higher than I would expect .
In summary, the meat dishes are good, the sides are marginal to lame and the wait staff often seems to be 'calling it in'. Not my favorite, but not the worst either. It will work in a pinch."}
{"text":"Totally delicious, Guinness on tap, cute waitress.

That's all I ask!"}
{"text":"Had the fried green tomatoes with rib tips! Melissa makes the best back porch strawberry lemonade... Epic!! Make sure to ask for Melissa, she is the best at custom making your drink and making suggestions!"}
{"text":"Awesome Lunch at this brand new addition to Red Rock! Never really enjoyed previous visits to Lucille's in Cali, but my family loves BBQ so... This new BBQ place really hits it out of the park with food, drinks, jazz music mood, & staff working hard to welcome customers... Enjoyed nachos, BBQ chicken salad, peach iced tea, & Mint Julep for dessert...  Did not want to leave & will be back!"}
{"text":"Great menu, lots of options at reasonable price. The biscuits are to die for, the ribs are great and so is the chicken. Portions are very generous and the servers are all so friendly. Our favorite is Kristy, she is always happy and friendly. You will leave there happy and full!"}
{"text":"The food is unbelievably amazing! Great price and the atmosphere is so fun! The manager, Sara, is so friendly. It does not feel like a food chain at all. It feels like you're hanging out in Louisiana!"}
{"text":"This night was to take out friends who had raved about this place.The orders of Dry Baby Back Ribs were overly dry, the Beef Ribs with little meat. The service was OK, but nothing special. If you wanted a refill on anything you had to ask, nothing was automatic. Our friends said something has changed with the food. 
I guess they are touchy about negative reviews since this is the Only one of my many reviews I found as flagged (for the wrong location - no less). So even though they show up as four stars, I suspect their actual reviews are lower. If these reviews get unreasonably Flagged by YELP and YELP does not answer inquiries, I question the reliability of their rating system."}
{"text":"Lucille's is very inviting.  On my last visit they had a blues singer that was amazing.  But to the food ...

I had the brisket with peanut coleslaw and baked beans.  The brisket was curious.  It could best be described as smoked pot roast.  It tasted good, but not at all what I think of as BBQ'd brisket.  The peanut coleslaw was very dry and I didn't finish it.  The baked beans were completely unremarkable.  

Even though the place was packed, the service was excellent.

So 2 stars for the BBQ plus 1 for the excellent ambiance.  On another visit,  I'll try the ribs."}
{"text":"I went with some family and the moment we walked in our mouths started watering from the smell. Everything that we ordered was fantastic and pretty good portion sizes. Their smoked meats were awesome. Despite being a 30 minute wait we got in much quicker than that and were seated outside. Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing. Be careful though if you don't hold on to it the server will take it from you when it's still half full. The service from Toby was awesome just don't sit at a table or you will have to hear what your server ate for lunch. Ps she didn't even take our order."}
{"text":"this is seriously good bbq, very homey, incredibly reasonable, and a huge menu to boot.  the waiting area is like your grandmother's livingroom, and the service is both fast and folksy.  we took a $60+ RT cabride from vegas, but it was so worth it.  the backporch plate of tri-tip, 1/2 chicken, and baby back ribs was so good it made my eyes roll up in my head, honey.  it came w/fabulous, tender biscuits, and a choice of 2 sides from a dizzyingly big list.  we chose well w/peanut slaw, and the potato salad, both of which I highly recommend. 

my only complaint, and it's a small but significant one, is the fried green tomatoes--they were swimming in some kind of creamy tomato sauce, which muddied up the fried goodness of the tomatoes.  I would have preferred a remoulade or tartar sauce, a la new orleans.  other than that, it was like going to heaven w/o dying.  

I think I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you won't get anything like this on the strip.  it's a huge relief to get away from the surf n' turf or high end, foofy places that fatigue both the wallet as well as the palate.  even w/the cabride, we saved money, and, even sharing the backporch special, we had enough leftovers, along w/the extra biscuits they gave us, that I had cold bbq chicken on biscuits for the next 3 days.

you can smell the meat cooking from about 1/2 mile away and it's popular, so make reservations, if you can.  it has an outdoor porch that looked great for nice days, but the place gets filled up fast, they tell me.  we got lucky or maybe just ate early, so there was no wait.  also, lucille's is in a shopping center, totally unassuming, but I can't wait to return on our next trip to vegas to try something else on the intimidatingly big menu.  I recommend this place, hands down--it's worth the taxi ride/ drive.  seriously."}
{"text":"My boyfriend went back to the red rock location two days ago and although we had a confusion with some tables in the lounge area not being the lounge, everything else was pretty good. I'm giving this review 4 stars strictly because of the service but not 5 because of the food. Our server, Alicia, was amazing. For being so young she was really attentive to not only us but the rest of her tables as well and she was very sweet. If we return to this location we'll definitely be requesting her!"}
{"text":"The food, service and decor are all pretty good. Brisket was tremendously savory. Homemade muffins were like little pillows. This is a good place for true smokehouse bbq. Decent service. The only thing is they cut there st louis style ribs and they are small. Tasty but small."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as usual but I do have to say the service was less than excellent.  First off we were seated in the corner with no one else around and secondly we were ignored.  We were seated and drink orders taken and it took 13 mins till we saw a person to place an order"}
{"text":"I like Lucille's for a chain BBQ restaurant, it's the best chain BBQ restaurant I have been too. And yes, I have been to Salt Lick when it was at the Red Rock and was not a fan. Although, I hear the original in TX is much better.  One of the reasons I like Lucille's is that they have beef ribs, which is not always plentiful at other restaurants.  A few years ago I went on a BBQ adventure of sorts and drove around Texas and the south trying to hunt down the best BBQ. And while Lucille's is not authentic in that it is smothered and basted in BBQ sauce, I still like it.  The sauce is a little sweet, and they have memphis, original and spicy sauce bottles on each table for more.  The portions are large and the sides are tasty. Last night we had the baked beans which had large pieces of pork in them and the cheesy grits - I love the grits. They remind me of the cheese grits I had when I was first introduced to cheese grits in South Carolina. Also, their iced tea is fresh brewed and they provide biscuits with a sprinkle of sugar on top and apple butter upon request. As to portion size I would almost say that they are almost the Claim Jumper of BBQ."}
{"text":"Had a great drink. Don't get the Brisket, get the RIBS...melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"happy hour is the only reason I go here, its been a few months since I've been and they took  gumbo OFF the happy hour menu and off the menu period. WHY. WFT.
some of the best I've ever had. they also raised the prices on happy hour. the server Ashley was great, but needless to say I will never be back."}
{"text":"This place has the closest food to being down south that I've ever had in Vegas. The BBQ is amazing. I have tried every side dish too, and they're all yummy! The flying pig in the bar is adorable!"}
{"text":"Fantastic smoked BBQ for the entire family!!! If you can withstand the usual long waits it's well worth it! We love the variety (they have BEEF Ribs) and the biscuits are amazing! Did I mention their sweet tea? 
A must try if you loved smokehouse style BBQ!"}
{"text":"The worst 2014 Thanksgiving take-out ever!  We were so disappointed that the food was so awful after they had told me that everything was cooked and smoked there.  It might have been--but from last year since the turkey and ham were so dry, hard, and tough.  It was like it had been micro-waved.

The sides were salty, and the gravy was thick as pudding. The sweet potato pie was fair. 

The packaging was nice, but we wanted some good food and that didn't happen.

We won't return even though we use to like the pulled pork and ribs.  It's true what people say that it is a hit and miss there.  The sign of a good restaurant is that it is always good."}
{"text":"I wasn't  really impressed with the food quality.  I thought it was really dry.  You are better off going up the street to Dave's BBQ.  The service was fine though."}
{"text":"No place better for BBQ beef ribs.  The waiters are friendly and knowledge about the menu items.  The portions are big and 3 ribs are more than enough for an average eater."}
{"text":"Eating at Lucille's is always an enjoyable experience for us.

Service - our waiter was a trainee with a more experienced waitress training him.  They both were very friendly & on top of making sure we were all doing well (we were a group of 7).

Food - always delicious!  Our whole party was raving about their food, since we all ordered different things.  Always love the Tootsie pops when we exit.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food (some of the best BBQ in town honestly) but not worth the 1.5 hour wait (waiting for a table and then waiting for the food) and the lack of attention from the wait staff.  By the time we got our food, no one in our party was even hungry so we just left.   What a waste of $$$$

Oh, and I'm tired of everyone on this site calling it apple butter.  Anyone from the south knows what apple butter is, and this is not apple butter.    What they give you is butter with cinnamon and sugar in it, NOT apple butter (so don't go here expecting apple butter)."}
{"text":"Loveee the biscuit with apple butter! So bomb!
But the rib tip was 50% fat and hardly edible. The mashed potatoes was good."}
{"text":"I have to say, not only is their food delicious, but the service is excellent. My mom and I ordered the baby back ribs, and they were perfectly done and a lot of meat. Huge rack. The waitress was beyond awesome and the manager went to every table asking how people were doing. My mom was so impressed that she doesn't want to go any where else for ribs.  I haven't been happy with Famous Daves, as their ribs are super fatty and it's really hit or miss when it comes to quality. Yes Famous Daves may be a little less expensive than Lucille's, but the quality is night and day. Makes more sense to get the full rack for leftovers. 
I've had their brisket, also delish. Love the sides. 
I'm getting hungry just writing this review. 
I hope Lucille's doesn't change the quality of meat they have because it's so perfect. 
I will be returning to Lucille's soon"}
{"text":"Lucille, oh Lucille. We enjoyed our meal! It's a solid 4 for BBQ. The service was a wee bit slow, but it was Memorial day weekend. The hostess was welcoming, and seated us right away. We did make reservations, and happy we did. The wait was about 20 min. The server was very busy, but she managed to keep a smile answering our questions. We ordered 3 of the half appetizers. The fried pickles were perfect. Nice flavorful breading, crispy, deliciousness. Fried green tomatoes were ok. The sauce was different, and reminded me of fancy cheese whiz? The artichoke was my favorite. I love artichokes. Kid's ribs with shoe string fries, awesome. Mom's rib tips; she didn't make a sound. She was too busy eating. Dad had the blackened catfish, and loved his meal.  The portions were big. Breadpudding for dessert was nom, nom, nom."}
{"text":"Wow!  One of the best BBQ restaurants I've eaten.  Group of 4 golfers visiting Arizona playing 72 holes were desperately in need of protein.  Found this joint on Yelp near our Airbnb location.  Walked in and sat down in the bar right away.  Wait staff was amazing with their smile and prompt response.  This place was so good we went back the next night for dinner.  72 holes of golf and 2 nights of ribs!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I came here for my birthday dinner last Sunday, which happened to be Easter Sunday. Our party consisted of 12 adults and 2 kids, and our waitress was beyond awesome for making sure everybody was okay throughout the evening. We ordered the Super Feast, which feeds 10+ individuals. The food was AMAZING. the various meats we ordered (i would name them all but we ordered so much that I can't remember them!) were really really great, very tender and succulent. The various sides we ordered (mac and cheese, corn, garlic mashed potatoes, and shoestring fries) were delicious. Of course the apple butter, which was served prior to our meal with biscuits, was tasty as always. They changed their biscuits since the last time I was here, not too crazy about the new ones. Our drinks, which were served in mason jars, were never empty, and we even got to take them to go (in a plastic cup, we of course couldn't take the mason jars home). Overall experience was GREAT! If I could give 10/5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Overpriced, food is ok, only been here 3-4 times.. Seems the same every time , nothing really has amazing flavor."}
{"text":"I thought a lot of fuss about nothing - but then I lived in the south for 8 years.  The biscuits were great, but the beef brisket not so much.  Mac and cheese yes.  Very loud and the service was not great.  Thought it was expensive as well."}
{"text":"Lucille's has the best biscuits! They are always hot, fresh, and big. I could easily eat the whole basket by myself. The portions here are massive so try not to eat before coming here. I've had plenty of things on their menu but my favorite is the BBQ chicken! It's really juicy and not dry like other places that I've had BBQ. You get to pick your sides, their mac-n-cheese is great and the baked potato (which is huge by the way). If you go during the week, there is not much of a wait, however, if you go on the weekend...be prepared to wait. Clean restaurant and the staff is very accommodating and friendly. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for GOOD BBQ!!"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb. Pricey but I truly enjoyed their food. Always busy and non stop so service isn't the best. Our waiter forgot half our order then forgot to take it off our bill when we didn't even receive the items. Oh well... food is worth going back to"}
{"text":"i cant seen to have enough of this delicious food. i love getting the tri tip and the mash potatoes."}
{"text":"great location..a hop and a skip away from green valley ranch casino.. had a difficult time deciding what to order... i may have salivated over the menu more than expected.. bbq was great.. even the fried pickles were yum.. had to sneak wat i had left into the theatre next door.  But my honest opinion... their bisquits are a little piece of HEAVEN!!  mmmm mmmm mmmm finger lickn good!"}
{"text":"We were there for lunch on 3-1-17. She ordered Pulled pork sandwich. He ordered fried chicken sandwich. I ordered Gumbo. All 3 were delicious no doubt! The gumbo is the dish in question. Before I could eat this delicious bowl of gumbo, I had to remove a total of 6 Bay Leaves from 1 serving of gumbo. I believe Bay Leaves are a very low return when it comes to flavor, but I'm not opposed to cooking with them. YOU DON'T LEAVE BAY LEAVES IN THE FINISHED DISH. I tried to explain this to the manager who came to our table, but she clearly does not understand the potential hazard of consuming BAY LEAVES! She said it was the decision of the Executive Chef to leave the bay leaves in the dish. Hey Executive Chef, NO NO NO. BAD CHEF!!!!!  If I had made the mistake to bite into one of too many bay leaves in the gumbo, the conversation between me and the manager would have been QUITE different. I was not looking for a freebie or gratis an any way, I just wanted to make the management aware of this cooking mistake sponsored by your Ex. Chef. I won't be back, but you might want to address this before you hurt someone."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took me 2 years to try this restaurant. Went last night and had the best food and service. Loved the homemade biscuits with cinnamon butter. I had the tri tip sandwich and it was delicious. Husband had the brisket which was also good. Can't go wrong with a place that serves their beverages in a mason jar - the strawberry lemonade hit the spot."}
{"text":"My company had a business meeting there yesterday and I ordered a combo platter or ribs, chicken and pulled pork.  The pork was drier than expected, the ribs were good, and the chicken was perfect.  I would go back and try it again and steer away from the pork."}
{"text":"Had Father's Day dinner tonight at Lucille's BBQ. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Good food and huge portions. Standard mid-range chain restaurant design, nice outdoor seating. 

Loved the mason jar beverages. 

Service was prompt and the waiter was appropriately contrite when my table mate complained about her meal. BBQ sauce was too sweet for her."}
{"text":"I was visiting AZ recently and had dinner with my family here.  The food was ok, not great and I thought the entrees were a bit pricey.  All in all it was ok, until we went to pay the check.  We were a large group and paid with cash and a credit card.  When we got the bill to sign, we realized he did not apply the full $100 in cash that we gave along with the credit card.  When we questioned the waiter, he got very defensive and pulled $40 out of his POCKET and said we only gave $40.  WTH? Why is it in his pocket and not the register??  We were adamant that we gave $100, he went inside and came back 10 min later with his Manager and apologized for the mix up.  The waiter said someone found it on the floor, while the Mgr said another waiter found it in the bill folder.  So which is it?  We thought we had the bill squared away until we checked our credit card online and we were charged the full amount 2x and now they won't provide a credit.  This really soured our experience, I've never seen anything like this before.  The food was ok but after this business with the check, I don't think we can go back.  Hopefully the credit card company can clear up the discrepancy."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of this place and this time was an exception. I ordered the two selection bbq platter. I found the food to be pretty dried up this go around. 1st time I easy happy with a meal here. I'll obviously give it another go at a later date. Just hope it was a fluke. Brett Russo"}
{"text":"They had awesome appetizers and food not to mention the Smokehouse margarita which was very complementary to the food. The service was great. The restaurant is well spaced out. And management seemed to be well involved. I will be recommending to friends since it was so enjoyable."}
{"text":"The Food and service is amazing, which in my opinion are two of the most important factors in a restaurant, besides cleanliness. Parking is easy to find, it is in a great location, the district.  
I love going here because my husband and I take our son to the fountains, walk around and look at a couple of stores and then head over to Lucille's for a delicious meal. 

The restaurant offers a great kids menu and I really love that they offer fresh cut watermelon as a side dish, which my son loves.

Must try Item: Deep fried pickles!!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner Last Night and the Place was packed. After waiting for 15 minutes we got seated and the service was very friendly. We ordered the rib appetizer, we had no idea ribs could possibly be so dry. We had a hard time cutting them off the bone.
Husband had fried catfish and shrimp , I had the BBQ chicken salad. Everything was bland and tasteless. 
Our bill came out to $65 and that is just ridiculous.
I haven't left so unsatisfied from a restaurant in a long time. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Introduced two friends to Lucille's recently-and they loved it!  Always a plus when you get to start with fresh hot bisucits smothered in cinnamon honey buter."}
{"text":"Excellent! We're southerners (visited from Atlanta), and we were amazed at how authentic the food tasted. We're sad there isn't one anywhere near us. The ribs were amazing. Chicken tender and great. Mac n cheese Excellent! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Last week was my first time eating at Lucille's and I had a great experience. I had a spinach dip, a quesadilla, and the croc cooler. What I enjoy the most was the welcoming environment. I am a very picky eater but the bartender Melissa was incredibly helpful and suggested excellent food choices. Overall, I had a great meal, drink, and was welcomed by excellent staff and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The ribs were overly sauced. And my beans were raw. Really was looking for a great BBQ place. Overall it's ok. Service is very slow."}
{"text":"The food is very good. The service as well is extraordinary, If you really enjoy bbq this is the place, the fries were smaller than I expected but as well they were delicious. I'd really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service for 3 people on a Saturday afternoon at 1230. After being seated in a half-full dining room we waited 10 minutes before a waiter approached and took our drink order. He said that he was not our server but he would let Charlotte(?) know what drinks we ordered. Some waters showed up about 5-10 minutes later. It took another 10 minutes to get two beers from the bar that was 6 ft from our table. Then after 10 minutes another waiter arrived named Robert who said he would wait on us. He took our order for a burger and sliders and disappeared for 45-50 minutes. The food was good that he finally brought out."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in Vegas! A little bit busy, but we had gone on a Sunday night, so to be expected. They've got salads, BBQ, burgers, pasta, and a kid's menu. Their iced teas are amazing and served in huge mason jars. Not too pricey either. It has a Southern creole feel to the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"I only gave them 2 stars because the food was good. Everything else was bad, really bad. We went on a Thursday night at 8pm, they were not busy. We were sat in a booth and it was freezing, not just cold. I would say it was at best 60 degrees, not enjoyable when you are trying to eat. Our waitress came over after 5 mins. at which time I asked about it being so cold, she response was the casino controls it but the servers love it because we get hot and it feels good, but not to worry that was the only cold spot in the resturant (judging by the people in jackets, in vegas, in summer, that was a lie) We ordered drinks, and when she brought them 10.mins later  we ordered an appatizer platter as well as our food. After 15 mins our food comes out, but no appetizer.  Our waitress is no where to be found, so we grab another waiter and tell him, we go ahead and eat because it's so cold our food is getting cold. My sister goes to take a drink of her sweet tea and there is fruit flies frozen into the ice. At this point myself and my food are frozen and I'm pretty upset. 15 mins. Go buy (Still no appetizer) and our waitress shows up and says, \"yeah so your appetizer is coming, I charged you for it so it's on its way\" I say ok that's fine but there is bugs in this drink, she looks in it and says \"oh, it's just fruit files, we have a problem with them because of the bar, did you maybe want a new drink?\" Of course we wanted a new drink, that is gross. She takes the drink, 2 mins. Later our appetizer comes out, now that we are almost done with dinner. 6 mins go buy before she brings the new drink back. I was pretty mad so I asked for the manager, who I tell the story too his reply was sorry we don't control the air. No mention of sorry there were bugs in your drink, or your food got cold, nothing. It really made me mad and I told him we would never be back and I was calling corporate. When our check came he had taken our appetizer off the check. I will never go back again, I should have paid more attention to the yelp reviews about this place. Good food does not make up for horrible service."}
{"text":"4 stars on food; 3 stars on service. We dined here last night for the first time and it wasn't too bad.  The menu selection is HUGE and it was tough for me to choose. I ended up ordering the beef tri tip sandwich--it was really tender and had JUST enough sauce on it. You also get to pick 1 side to go with your meal and you get complimentary biscuits with apple maple butter--the butter was pretty good!

For the service--the only thing I was mad about was the biscuits! What do I have to do to get some dang biscuits! We asked 3 times for it altogether. It FINALLY came out AFTER our entree's came out. NOT ok. Definitely not OK when you have to ask 3 times for it. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll come back here again but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Made our first visit to Lucille's on Sat evening and I have to say we had a very nice experience. Service was attentive and food was very well done!   Melt in your mouth Tri Tip with very tasty cheese grits for me. The extra bonus was several creative Veggie choices for my non carnivore spouse.  She's always frustrated by most restaurants casual nod to vegetarian choices but Lucille's had several options to pick from.  At a BBQ place, who woulda thunk it.  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was not the first time I've been to Lucille's, which us good cause if it was I doubt I'd return. The food was ok, but the gravy they gave me for my steak looked like an oil slick and didn't taste much better. Thank goodness it was on the side. My sisters Mac & Cheese took forever to come out which I didn't understand at all. We actually had to ask our server about it. 
Our servers name was Wendy, try to not get her when you go. She came to our table very rarely, never asked how the good was and didn't ask if we wanted dessert or anything else, which we did. She just dropped the check. 
Next time I'll just go to Yardhouse."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and it wasn't that crowded. I'm a little disappointed with this location though, my friends jambalaya came out first and it clearly was dry so he sent it back. It took about 8 mins for the remade plate to hit the table again. I was almost done with my food by the time he got his... Service was a little slow but it was expected... We also order dessert and they didn't bring any utensils out so of course we had to wait again.
The food wasn't as good as the other location. I would definitely go back to the GV location!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I am always able to find something to eat here. The service is usually amazing but when I went tonight the service was slow and our waiter seemed to forget about us often. We had to remind him to get our check and then we had to call him over to even pick it up. I waited for at least 20 minutes for our check. I was not very impressed. I think it will be a while before I come here again"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with some coworkers. I got the ribs and tri-tip beef lunch special with garlic mashed potatoes and corn chowder. The servers also gave us biscuits with cinnamon sugar butter and fried pickles. Also, drinks come in these big mason jars.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. The food was okay.  The brisket burnt ends were nothing but fat.  Tri tip was dry but mashed potatoes and cole slaw was good.  Felt rushed by server as the hot towels were brought out during the middle of the meal and when they needed to be used they were cold.  Had similar experiences before and only went back as we had a gift card.   Apparently not much has changed."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful. We were visiting from the Bay Area and looked this place up before we left for Vegas. We actually went on Christmas Day. They were busy and the place was mostly full, we got seating for five in about twenty minutes. Server came over right away \"Savanah\", she was so pleasant and friendly. Biscuits with sweet butter was warm and fitting for a cold day. Food was ready in a reasonable time considering the place was full and they were also showing the Warriors vs Cleveland game which was also fantastic. The food was so fresh and perfectly seasoned. I had ribs, links and chicken....all of which was perfect. Server-great, food-great, and at the end you get a hot wash towel which topped everything off. What a perfectly, delicious Christmas dinner. This place is awesome, do not second guess, just go and experience it for yourself."}
{"text":"I went here due to a friends recommendation. He said this place had the most amazing bbq in town. Not so! It was ok. That's it. It didn't strike me as anything out of the ordinary. It was decent and good but nothing extra special. Prices are good and portions are large."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was great. Went on a Friday about 7 and was seated in about 10 mins. Make sure you do the call ahead before you go so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Love the Big Easy BBQ shrimp here, I haven't had a bad meal yet - but the BBQ shrimp is my go-to favorite. I love their cheese grits!! We eat here a lot. Also...we always get their large banana pudding to go, the vanilla wafers are so mushy and yummy the next day."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of service. It was bad and got worse. No one came over for a few minutes. We ordered water. No sign for some time. Finally showed up. No taking of order. No biscuits. Eventually we ordered. I asked for side salad - what is on it? The usual plus cheese. Asked for no cheese. Showed up w croutons which were not mentioned. \"There's a process\" was answer to questions about ill timed meal. Manager dropped by. Oh the waiter was trainee you'll get the trainer now. You'll get service that exceeds your expectations. Uh no.  We split a rack of baby backs. They brought a tiny plate to split onto. Brought larger plate on request. Wanted second normal size plate. Had to catch a passing server. Paper napkins had to be requested. Hot towels brought far too late. The ribs,  corn and sweet potato fries were good. Service not!! Maybe if the server who was the trainer was well-trained the trainer would have been better? And the manager? Useless."}
{"text":"So my father in-law is in town visiting and I find myself exploring smokehouses and steakhouses to make sure he gets his meat.
Lucille's was a nice surprise. There were plentiful appetizers with the grilled artichoke standing out the most. Whats great is you can get discounted appetizers during happy hour in the bar area, or do what we did and order 1/2 orders of about 3-4 appetizers. Still good portions.
The veggie burger was also tasty. (black charred grill marks on the burger, cheese, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions and a sesame bun.) The burger came with your pick of 1 side. I choose the sweet potato fries which were fat and crispy. There are plenty veggie sides to choose from!
The waiter was very helpful and friendly. You can also substitute the veggie burger on any of the other burger/sandwiches.
My in-law ordered the brisket salad (large) and thought it was excellent. Be aware that the large salad portion is HUGE! But salad did look yummy and fresh so Ill be ordering the vegetable salad next time.
The sweet tea and lemonade is served out of big glass jars and are delicious. However, I don't know if they give free refills.
All around great place to hang out, eat, and drink. Nice atmosphere!

Oh the complimentary bread basket is delicious biscuits with apple butter. Hard to just have one of these babies!"}
{"text":"Lucille's is consistently good and they have a lot of options. No matter if its a business lunch or a family dinner; it's great. Never disappointed with food or service!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ! Better than famous daves. Best brisket ive ever had."}
{"text":"The prices are quite high, but you will get a TON of food in return, and most of it is very good. nothing mind blowing or unlike anything i have ever tasted, but they know what they are doing and how to do it well. I highly recommend it. They have live blues music on some nights which is good, but note that if you are near the bar they play Quite loud, and it doesn't work for a nice quiet night out, it feels like you are at a concert."}
{"text":"Wonderful service.  However their signature tri tip sandwich was dry and closer to leather than beef.  The full rack of St. Louis ribs was a fairly meager portion for the price.  The shoestring fries were great. Eat in the bar.  It's much more relaxed and less of a circus."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for years, but my last two visits have been terrible. On my first visit my wife and I were enjoying lunch when I spotted a cockroach walking across my table.  I didn't make a big deal out of it I merely put in a napkin and handed it to the waitress.  She was very nice and got her manager.  I didn't expect anything as I know this was not intentional, but we did lose our appetite.  The manager apologized and ordered us a round of beers which we didn't want and didn't drink as we were there for lunch and didn't intend on drinking to much.  The manager then apologized for sending us an additional round and comped our first round.  We didn't go for a few months.  I recently returned on Sunday and had some of the worst service I have ever had.  I was there for lunch again, and the bar area was pretty slow.  Our waitress came by in about five minutes time which was not a big deal.  We ordered waters and a ginger ale which they were out of.  When the waitress returned with our water she took our order a burger, a BBQ salad, biscuits and fried pickles as an appetizer. We received our pickles pretty quickly but no utensils no extra plates and no biscuits.  We then waited a total of 30 minutes with no contact with our waitress.  This was the first time I have ever walked out of a place.  I didn't want to deal with the waitress so I just went to the front to pay for our pickles.  The cashier was confused as to why we're leaving, so she called her manager.  Her manager said oh it looks like you ordered some food it is almost ready would you like us to box it up. I said no thank you I would just like to pay for what we ate and leave and explained to her how long we had been there and how poor the service was.  She apologized and said that the pickles  would be taken care of.  To be honest I used to love this place and would go often for dinner and drinks with friends, but after these two visits I will never return."}
{"text":"My first impression of Lucille's when I walked towards it was \"chain restaurant\" and expected to see an Applebees like atmosphere.  Some of the memorabilia did resemble Applebees.  I did feel after I walked in that this place might actually look legit.  I like staring at interesting stuff on the wall while waiting for food or lulls in conversation with my co-eaters.  I must say that they hire very attractive waitstaff as our hostess was very typical of other females around the Tempe marketplace.....attractive!!  

I looked through a large menu and decided to stick with my routine of going to the baby back ribs as a meter of how good a BBQ place is.  I then noticed they had different \"platters\" which offered more of a diverse plate.  I went with the \"porch platter\" which included a choice of three different ribs, BBQ chicken and a choice of meat along with your choice of two sides from an extensive list.  Baby back ribs and tri-trip were my choices alongside favorites garlic mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  For only $1.50 I added a Caesar salad to my meal.  The waiter offered strawberry lemonade as a good choice of beverage and I went with that.

The strawberry lemonade was sweet and refreshing.  Served in a good sized glass jar, it offered a throwback to days when lemonade tasted good and not just sugary.  Unfortunately, it was almost too good.  I immediately got a glass of water so as not to end up drinking 2 or 3 of the lemonades.  I was also on a budget and was looking at $35 as being my \"damage\" already including tip.  

The salad was nothing exciting and I wasn't expecting anything exciting either for $1.50.  Typical side salad and I enjoyed it.  I'm sure ordering the full size salad might be a little more involved.  Maybe they might even throw an anchovy on it.

The platter mixed disappointment with delight.  The baby back ribs weren't as tender and juicy as I like.  It was hard to find the sections to cut with my knife so that I could pick them up and suck on those meat Popsicles.  They just sort of shredded off and i ended up eating ribs with a fork (a food sin!).  The tri-tip was good.  Seemed to be lacking that smoky flavor I'm used to when I BBQ my own...seemed more like a very tender steak.  I enjoyed it though and would recommend it.  The chicken was amazing.  So tender and juicy.  There wasn't any left to put in my take home container as I could not resist polishing it off immediately.  

The mac and cheese wasn't anything special and I'd recommend not getting it for one of your sides.  The garlic mashed potatoes were better, but dry and not that creamy, garlicky taste you expect when you order them.  It was probably by design, as it contained chunks in it.  

A great place for a family dinner or an outing with a buddy.  Not gourmet, but who wants that when you eat BBQ anyways.  The prices can add up on you quick so try not to order too much with your stomach...who am I kidding?  That's the best part!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas ....highly recommend the ribs........big portions good staff....reasonable prices...wish i lived closer"}
{"text":"GREAT customer service, AMAZING food, I will always come back. Best barbecue in town. The building is so so cute, and decorative. My partner is vegan, and they had the manager come out and talk options, super nice and personable. Made her feel important, unlike other places we've been to. if you haven't checked them out, do it!!! 5/5"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there this afternoon. The food was great. We also enjoyed the sauces they have on the table. Our server, Robert, was attentive and friendly. It was a nice dining experience and I plan on coming back again."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I am no expert on BBQ, but I really like this place. The Carolina style pulled pork sandwich is awesome. It has the right amount of pepper and just a touch of vinegar. And I always love New Castle brown ale. It has a nice bar with a good selection of beer and liquor."}
{"text":"3 stars is a bit harsh but I was not impressed. I went with my family (7) of us and the restaurant was not busy so you would think service would be on point. It was not. It took almost 10 min to get waters and another 5 after that to get our alcoholic drinks. Our server was not attentive at all. Service was horribly slow and after getting our order in, food came out in waves. My food was cold but our server never came back to check to see if we needed anything. I had to get up and seek out a manager just to get the rest of our food and other things we had asked for several min earlier. Again, it was a pretty empty restaurant. When our server finally did come back I told him he could take my plate. He asked if everything was ok and I told him it was cold. He did what he could offering to get my something else and he did take off my sandwich which was delicious just cold. He also took care of our appetizer. 

When you make a reservation and still have to wait 45min past it..not acceptable and the manager could care less...awful"}
{"text":"The food was DEE-licious! I had the baby-back-rib appetizer and if this is an appetizer, I cannot imagine what a meal would be like. This was like 7 decent sized and really yummy ribs! If I stopped right there, this would be a five-star review, BUT 

the service is unbelievably slow! Party of 8, we arrived at 12:30, seated right away and then waited ... waited ... Server finally appeared. A lovely, cheerful young woman. Took our drink order and then we waited ... waited ... About 10 minutes later she came back with the waters & iced teas, but the beer drinkers had to wait ... wait... 

Someone finally served the beers and a few minutes after that, our waitress came back to take our order. I asked about separate checks. She said their policy was not on large parties, but she'd go check with the manager. I told her no, fearing we'd have to wait some more. She took our order -- we had now been there about 45 minutes. She asked if we would like biscuits. Yes! Anything! 

A few minutes later, someone brought us biscuits and my side order of a small green salad which was actually quite large and yummy. (At that point cardboard would have tasted yummy!) Finally, well over an hour after we were seated, our orders began to arrive. All but one. We all waited (again!) politely for the 8th order to arrive. For some reason, it was held up. The rest of us finally thew aside manners and began eating. Half way through our meal, her food was served. 

The quality of the food was excellent. I thought the prices were are a bit over-the-top. My \"appetizer\" was $15.99, but as I said it was good and combined with the side salad ($2.99) and a roll, it was plenty -- I took some home for dinner. 

I would say that if you are in a relaxed mood and not all that anxious to get your food, this would work well. I do not recommend it for large parties since we then had to spend another 10 minutes breaking down the bill, who-had-what, how much of a tip (I thought the guys were very generous considering the slow service), etc. Thank goodness we all had cash -- not everyone does these days. 

The whole thing was two hours from seating to finishing. Waaayy too long. 

Oh, one other thing -- they crammed us into two small tables shoved together. We were elbow to elbow which was not necessary because there were several empty tables around us. I would not recommend this for a large group."}
{"text":"I will NEVER go to this restaurant again. It was the worst customer service from the beginning to the end! On Friday August 3rd 2012 I was there for a retirement party for a co worker of 31 years and we were wanting to celebrate! I called in earlier and spoke with C.... and asked if it was possible to get the happy hour prices. He had asked his manger and was given the OK to give us the happy hour prices to our group. We are seated and I see the waitress and tell her that C.... said we get the happy hour pricing and she said great. C.... found me and said he was unable to honor the happy hour pricing that he thought I was from another group of forty. I said how was that possible when I gave you all of the information of our group. He said he was sorry that he could only honor 1 drink per person from the happy hour menu. By that time all of us where aware of what I was told earlier. I was a waitress and have worked in the restaurant field for years and never ever would I have told forty people they would not honor a request that had already been approved by a manager earlier. Needles to say My family & I did not order one thing from this place and never will. They lost over $150.00 just by my family. The people that did order received the wrong food and the food tasted awful. For the prices they charge I think they should be able to hire people that can take care of you just a bit better then we were. I go to restaurants that on person can handle a table of 40 and get all the food and drink orders correct not two or three people and get most the orders incorrect. 

I will take my hard earned money where it is appreciated!

{"text":"Mediocre. Drinks were fine, but overall not good bar-b-que."}
{"text":"Love coming here & getting the 24 hr.  marinated steak w/2 sides . Their steak gravy is to die for! Their's at least 16 sides to choose from and their drinks are delicious! Great service and was seated within 5 - 10 min of checking in we were a party of 3 . Its kid friendly and theirs a gluten free menu available also. It gets pretty busy espeacially around dinner time so you might want to make a reservation a head of time."}
{"text":"It's not awful but it's not bad either. It's one of those places where the food and drink menu are both sooooooo long that they kitchen and bar probably have a tough time turning out good stuff conssitently. 

I do like the spinach dip, brisket and their BBQ sauces, plus there is always plenty to take home and it reheats well the next day. I'm not impressed with the side dishes (garlic mashed potatoes are good but those are hard to screw up). 

It's an easy place to meet up with friends or bring out-of-town guests/kids. And, I might have to steal the leg lamp ... fra-gee-lay, that must be Italian."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Lucille's in green valley and it was definitely worth it. Lu was our server and he was awesome! He walked us through the menu and explained how they slow smoke their meats. His menu knowledge was excellent and he made sure we didn't over order. We will definitely be asking for him next visit! The food was amazing as well. Biscuits and apple butter were out of this world! And the tri-tip.... You could cut it with a fork. Everything we ordered from fried okra to cheesy grits and sweet peach tea was delicious. Would highly recommend this place! And ask for Lu! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to go! This is my girlfriend and my go to place for any date night.  The service is always so wonderful and their food is so delicious!  Make sure you order the cheesecake for dessert because it is one of my favorite cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"The baby back ribs were falling apart!! Delicious and perfectly seasoned! My hubby's Mardi gras chicken was spicy, crispy, and had the most amazing gravy on it (sausage and shrimp and peppers all over it). The kids' portions were large and the kids were very happy with the flavors! We had the fried okra as an appetizer which also was tasty! Oh, the waitress was so sweet and had the best attitude. We had a great experience here."}
{"text":"With so many options in the Valley why not dine in or take out from Lucille's, where do I begin? BBQ Tri Tip, Baby Baby Back Ribs,  and sides including a wicked looking Brownie Cheesecake. Fortunately I know when to stop!!  Ha!! Btw... Cheers to Management for the delightful Customer Service, friendly atmosphere and keep up the great job Xavier!"}
{"text":"Love the potatoe chip appetizers. I had the Catfish, grits and greens.  Ir was delicious.  Hubby had the Tri-tip sandwich.  Boys had burger and Shrimp with steak.  We all enjoyed the atmosphere and meal."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in town! This place is on the opposite side of town from where I live,but it worth the drive! They have a great happy hour. The menu is so huge! Great variety. Service is always good."}
{"text":"Everything was better than expected. From the service to environment and especially the food. Every order was perfect and tasted amazing. Don't come here if your trying to curb your appetite!"}
{"text":"So... First off... The food is absolutely amazing! Second... The food is absolutely amazing!

The atmosphere is relaxed, friendly and they really live up to the southern hospitality that they advertise.

We were helped by Thomas. He gave us some really great advice on what to try.

We both order the the Two Meat Combo and while we had leftovers we got to try the ST Louis ribs, the beef ribs, brisket and ribs tips.. for sides we tried the baked potato, garlic mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese and corn on the cob. We both had the strawberry lemonade.

I have not one complaint on the food except that it was so good I didn't save room for dessert and had to request our orders of carrot cake and chocolate cake to go."}
{"text":"My first experience there was Sunday,June 5, 2016. I had he brisket and it was awesome. Others in the party had he same and the plate with  half chicken, ribs, economic. So much food for them. The biscuits and fried green tomatoes are great. We will go back when the weather is cooler so we can sit outside. Loved the atmosphere. The only complaint to is the sides could use a tad improvement, especially the Cole slaw and bake potato warmer."}
{"text":"Great place and very responsive to Yelp. I really appreciate that. Bradley H. Is on top of his game."}
{"text":"Brooke was an amazing waitress.Awesome food.Atmosphere was great.Saying bye bye to Famous Dave's forever."}
{"text":"1.) They have gluten-free options! You can eat something else besides a salad here, thank God...
2.) Very nice staff and service
3.) Pricey...expect to drop about $50 for two people with alcoholic drinks included..lunch is expensive as well..
4.) The taste is unique and I enjoy their bbq"}
{"text":"Lucille's came through when we had our son's rehearsal dinner. We scheduled it for the wrong date. I called Lucille's and they put our order ahead of others and had a caterer on site. They did an amazing job when we didn't know what to do. We had 55 people waiting on the dinner. They had the entire catering request to us in just a little over an hour. If this wasn't enough, the food was amazing. Everyone commented that it was worth the wait!  The cater helped us get set up and made sure we had everything we needed before she left. She told us to call if we needed ANYTHING.
I would definitely eat and cater from Lucille's again."}
{"text":"Recently ordered take out from Lucille's because it was Valentine's day, I had a craving for brisket and cornbread, and I really didn't want to deal with the crowds on the fore mentioned holiday. 

Having been to Lucille's before I knew it was a fairly solid joint in terms of food and and service.   At least if you eat in.... ordering take out well lets just say it left a lot of room for improvement.  

When I called up to order the phone was answered \"hello\" not something more akin to \"Lucille's this is \"insert name here\" how can I help you?\"  Ok it's a busy day I can let that slide.   I'm then put on hold (at least they asked if I would hold) for 5 minutes, the gentlemen gets on the phone and I start rattling off my order which he gets down and repeats back to me (for the record it was two 10oz Texas brisket dinners with sides of peanut slaw, regular slaw, corn on the cob, and mac&cheese).... sadly they do not have cornbread, just biscuits... man I really wanted cornbread. 

I'm then told my order will be ready in 20 minutes.... I ask that it be ready around 6PM since it's 2:30 in the afternoon and I'm very much still at work doing this.  The gentleman taking my order changes.   

So 6PM rolls around I walk in and the gentleman at the counter goes over my order has me sign a sheet saying that he reviewed the order and everything was in order I pay and off I go.  This is where I should have asked for little things like flatware, BBQ sauce, and towelettes.   

So I go where I'm going and I get out the dinners for myself and the my friend and that's when the lack of flatware pokes it's head out.... then the brisket... it's ok but not great and could really use some sauce... and cornbread.... the corn on the cob is a dry and bland (probably a side effect of it being February and the corn being frozen), the peanut slaw is good, the regular slaw is serviceable. The biscuits are ok but in case you haven't noticed cornbread would have been better.  

I wasn't thrilled with the dinner, it wasn't the worst BBQ I've had but it was no where near the best.   If I had to do it again I probably would have made the trek out to Dave's BBQ in Gilbert instead."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waitress was horrible. People that came in after us were getting served eating and paying before you even got our drinks. Will never be back to this location"}
{"text":"Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ is the best BBQ in Las Vegas. The tri-tip is beyond belief and the baby back ribs fall off the bone. Soak the meats in your favorite BBQ sauce and you're in heaven."}
{"text":"Sirloin steak wedge salad is so satisfying!"}
{"text":"Get the beef ribs they are amazing. When they bring the plate up to you it's like the opening of The Flintstones when they set down the side of a dinosaur and tip the car over. Everything is good here though. I even had a vegetarian friend go there and loved their vegetarian burgers"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times with some coworkers, and my last and final trip was yesterday. It was a friend's birthday dinner, 10+ of us around 8pm. Not a busy hour whatsoever. Anyways, by the time we asked for our check back, she THEN tells us that since there are 11 of us, she can ONLY split it 3 ways. The waitress Kim then drops us the check, shrugs, and tells us to figure it out and walks away. Caused a great night, to end terrible since all of us had to scramble around, find the nearest ATM and pay one another back. 

A heads up would have been more appreciated."}
{"text":"I was told -- and asked 3 times -- of this place had a dog friendly patio. I was reassured all 3 times they did. I get here and they say I can't go in. NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit, just a fifteen minute drive from the condo. I liked everything about Lucille's. The white clapboard exterior trimmed with green & white awnings, invites everyone. Very remindful of my days on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The Jambalaya was superb, loaded with shrimp & andoulle sausage, rice, peppers & a reaux that was delicious. The apple butter & freshly baked biscuits were as good as advertised. The Corona was ice cold, with attentive servers. $46 included tip & tax.   NICE DEAL !!"}
{"text":"Forgot how good Lucille's is! It's been a while I gotta say it was good to be back. Dined in on a Saturday evening. This place was pretty full with a short 15 minute wait. 

For starters had Lucilles Onion Straws served with their own BBQ Ranch dipping sauce. The half order is more than enough for 2 people. Must try! 

Biscuits served for free came hot with a nice pairing of their own apple butter. 

Main Course had the BBQ Half Chicken & 2 Meats. The 2 meats were pulled pork & a cheddar bacon sausage link. The chicken was tender & juicy. The sausage was grilled to perfection. The pulled pork tender. 
Our server Nicole was the Bomb! 
I have to stop in more often. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the mediocre to bad service this would be a 4-5 star place easy! The food is spectacular, hands down my favorite BBQ in Las Vegas. As usual with The District, parking is terrible, and the wait is usually 45 minutes to an 1 hour+.

Happy hour is great and the live music in the bar makes for a great place to have a couple beers and hang out. Best service is in the bar."}
{"text":"Love the food and service was great!  Ask for Deisy for your waitress and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Service is very fast and friendly prices not too bad.  The food was not bad, nor was it great just average.  Had the St. Louis ribs which were flavorful but not very large and they did not dress it well by removing the membranes.  

The biscuits and honey butter are really good but the greens were a bit too salty for my taste.  potatoes salad and Cole slaw were both OK.  

Again not bad, just not great just remember that I am a BBQ snob."}
{"text":"This place is the best barbeque in the valley, but that isn't saying that much. I definitely prefer this place to Famous Dave's or El Paso.

I had a rack of ribs that was pretty good, but the pork was cured so much it tasted more like salty ham on bone. My wife had a barbeque sandwich that was good quality. The strawberry lemonade is really good but I'm sure it contains a pound of sugar."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great happy hour at the bar and Toby and Daniele are the best.  Good service, cold beer and the tri tip is amazing."}
{"text":"I just had a take-out order of St. Louis style ribs with a side of macaroni and cheese and sweet potato. WOW! This is the first time I had their mac and cheese and it is so creamy, cheesily delicious! I can eat it all day long.  The sweet potato was also pretty good. The ribs never fail to satisfy me."}
{"text":"Every time I go in this place it's always a great experience.  My wife and I have been going to Lucille's pretty much every other Sunday for the last couple months.  Her favorite is the pulled pork mine is the Kansas City ribs, but we always have to start our meal off with the fried pickles.  If you're on a tight budget even buying one meal and sharing it is a definite option.  Sometimes I get full on the biscuits and spread the provide in the beginning.

The bar area is a great place to have a meal and watch a game.  I would highly recommend this establishment to any of my friends.  But make sure you get the fried pickles... you will not be disappointed.

Oh yeah.....please please please order the Mac 'N Cheese as your side.  You will thank me later.

{"text":"Spent $8 not including tip on crappy cold chicken tenders.  I work at a diner and the strips which are appetizers are actually strips not 1/2 a chicken breast with no flavor.  Rip off."}
{"text":"Love this place, perfect spot, good food, I like their bbq shrimp, yes indeed, and excellent service."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people, none of which had ever been so we choose it based on the high recommendation of many others. Service was good, but my husband ordered the triple meat plate (tri tip, bb ribs and bbq chicken). For $35/plate we were expecting some good food! He was very disappointed! The bb ribs were one of the worst I have had! They were far too salty and very dried out. The chicken was undercooked and rubbery! Let's just say We could have done better at home for 1/4 the cost. We were so disappointed! We were starving and had an event after so even though they offered us another meal we were not able to wait for it. It made for a good doggy bag...literally! My pulled pork sandwich was good as was the Apple butter/biscuits. The couple we came with had no complaints about their food. Time to find a better rib place!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed the Las Vegas Lucille's many times.  Ribs, beans - don't get much better"}
{"text":"I stopped by to check out the new Lucille's for happy hour.  They are still going through some opening pains that caused the service to be below expectations.  Hopefully the service will improve as the staff gains more experience.  The highlight was the wedge salad - delicious with the crispy smoked bacon bits.  The Irish nachos (French fries with cheese) were tasty but got soggy as they cooled off.  The fried green tomatoes were good but the batter broke off of the tomatoes when cut.  The rib tips  and sausage were well prepared but in general I find Lucille's BBQ sauce too sweet for my taste. I also didn't really care for the biscuits with sugar on top.  Finally the happy hour drink choices: They have a good selection of Skky Vodka martinis but I found their happy hour beer selections limited primarily to their house brews."}
{"text":"Although I thought the food was good, and our server was fine the biggest issue was that the manager who was happily cutting the cakes in the kitchen was also happily licking her fingers of the chocolate frosting and picking up bits of crumbs as she was cutting the cakes. When I called her on it she claimed she was washing her hands when she was doing it and seemed to think she could argue that it was ok. I let her know it was no ok at all for her to be doing such things washing or not.  Worried if she is the manager what are the other employees learning from her about food safety and handling."}
{"text":"YANKEE BAR B QUE  !!!!!!!    been better off to eat a bologna sandwich .  i cant believe they can call this BAR B QUE......."}
{"text":"Such a great restaurant such good food I love the BBQ sausage and Mac n cheese. A must go to place n try it."}
{"text":"My family and I came in on a Thursday night at 5. The food took about 30 minutes to come out. When they brought it out they let us know it had to be remade that's why it was so long. My son had a great burger and my boyfriend had the Memphis pulled pork sand which that was pretty good. My Cajun chicken sandwich was definitely the worst out of the 3. It was blackened with Cajun seasoning completely over seasoned and it was cold. I believe mine sat out while they remade my boyfriends since his was the one that was dropped and had to be remade. The service was nice but the food isn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"20 minute wait to seat two people when there are 12 open tables... They need to learn how to staff on weekends to service this traffic better. Poor and just plain rude hostess staff. 

Update on the wait, the reason it is taking so long is the hostess staff is moving slower than a snail. Remora and Brandon should find work where they can get paid talk rather than \"work\""}
{"text":"Best ribs in town! Ask for the beef gravy when ordering the mash potatoes! so yummy yummy"}
{"text":"I really like coming to this place for the beef ribs. If you are a big eater and want something filling, get the 7 bone order of beef ribs and you won't be disappointed.  They seem to come very well done so this time I asked for them \"not so dark\" and they came out perfect.  I did have one rib bone with very little meat and the waiter took care of it for me.  The manager ended up bringing it to our table and asked us if we needed anything else. Oh and you can't beat the biscuits and butter."}
{"text":"Lucilles used to have the best ranch dressing made from scratch. Now they switched to bottle dressing. It sucks! I used to go there for salads all the time because it was so good. I guess I need to find a new place to go ."}
{"text":"Make sure you come with a big appetite.  Their portions are huge!  We ordered a half size of their appetizer platter for four of us.  We probably could have done without our meals after that as it was a very nice portion of different items.  Two of us shared their 2 meat combo which was more than enough.  We had their baby back ribs and the tri tip, garlic mash and Mac and cheese.  The meat was tender and tasty.  Loved the mash potatoes.  Nothing spectacular about the Mac and cheese... I'd do better with stovetop Kraft.  I also had their watermelon tea...ehhh.  Others ordered their pulled pork sandwich and a ribs plate.  You absolutely can't go wrong with the portions and prices at this place.  

The live blues music was also nice on a Saturday night.  Nice country decor and service was really great.  Everyone there was very attentive and friendly.  I'd recommend this place and would come here again."}
{"text":"I found this place to be great for BBQ and Cajun. The seafood gumbo and jambalaya dishes are really good if you are in the mood for Cajun. The ribs and bbq chicken are also excellent dishes. The complementary biscuits are a definite hit and the unsweetened peach tea is a great option if you listen to the Surgeon General and do not drink alcohol. (:"}
{"text":"This place is like a shack somewhere in the south. The food is yummy and great for families or big groups; you can order a couple different meats and sides. The ice tea is good, forget it...everything is good.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We had heard of the Lucille's in Vegas.  They raved about it, so we decided to give it a try at Tempe Marketplace.  We drove 30 minutes down from North Phoenix.

Found the ambiance to be 'cluttered', but probably one of this chains trademarks.  You could tell that some light shades had probably been broken and they had been substituted for something else.  Carpet was clean, our booth was clean and comfortable.

We were seated right away, but had to wait to get someone to take our drink order, which wasn't our server.  What they did was go into the kitchen to tell the server assigned to our table they had a table.  That's when our server came out and we gave our drink order a second time.  After we got our drinks, the server said that they would be right back with the biscuits which was the quickest thing done re: the whole dining experience.

We gave our dinner order when the biscuits were brought out.  For an appetizer, we ordered the onion strings, which were basic onion strings.  

My dinner partner ordered the Beef Tip sandwich w/ mashed potatoes as their side.  The sandwich was lukewarm.  The mashed potatoes were cold.  We kept the sandwich as is, but had new potatoes brought out - these were hot.  Obvious that the food had been sitting on the rack waiting to be served.  My dinner partner made the comment that the sandwich would have been good if it have been hot.

I ordered the Cajun Chicken sandwich with the peanut coleslaw.  My sandwich was hot.  Problem was that chicken was cooked so that it was tough.  Tough to take a bite, tough to chew and tough to cut with the steak knife.  Made we wonder about the quality of the meat.

Through out the evening we had 4 different servers taking care of us.  Have no idea what our server was doing.  We hardly saw them out on the floor.  When they were, they at least came by 3 times to see how we were doing.  Take note, they were not the one who brought out the appetizer or the food.

We also watched as other parties came, got seated and were getting their food before we did.  Our server didn't even bring out the check, a whole other server who was trying to get their food served to their table had to drop it off.

The food was nothing special and over priced.  Definitely have had better for less.

Can't really rate our server on their service since we had so many different people coming by the table.  Were they nice and pleasant - Yes.  Did they try to fix the problem - yes.  The problem was something that shouldn't have happened in the first place.  The overall experience wasn't all that great from the very beginning.

As we watched the other tables we took note that the other tables did not have the entire 'team' thing going on.  Those servers took care of their tables and were attentive to their customers.

We will not be returning.  For the money and overall experience and 30 minute drive, not worth the trip to Tempe."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. We made a reservation for 7:15 on a Saturday for 8 people...hence why we called and made a reservation for a Saturday.....we get to the restaurant and with a reservation it was still an hr and half wait as the guy at the front stated...why on earth would you continue to take reservations and walk ins if you had that ridiculous of a wait for RESERVATIONS!?! The manager who I spoke with...kuddos for coming to talk to me...but when all you can say is sorry and that it is because of all the reservations then you have a problem...not happy..."}
{"text":"We received excellent service and the food was good as well. God bless and Jesus loves you."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Lucille's, so I picked it for my birthday dinner this last Wednesday night.  Service was terrific, but the beer was almost room temperature (two different drafts, but the same temp), the ribs I ordered were dry (only ate 4 and normally eat a half rack), my daughter's steak was dry, and my husband's brisket was...you guessed it... dry. Beans were undercooked.  Absolutely tasted like a typical casino cafe, not the Lucille's experience we use to get at the Henderson location.  We had dinner at this location (Summerlin) a couple of years back and it was great.  We will not be back.  Clearly not worth the $117 dinner ticket. I'm not willing to risk this kind of money on cafe style food."}

{"text":"I would liketo state that my confedence in Lucille's has been restored, the food has always been consistant and good, the problem i recently had was with service, which was greatly inproved this last visit over a month ago. I decided to head in and have some BBQ before heading to mexico for a week. It was nice to not have the same problem with service, i'm not sure if the patio area still has the problem, as that was the area i had the original problem in, in any case I enjoy lucille's and would go back."}
{"text":"This is the one stop shop for ribs and anything BBQ related. I go with the baby backs and let me tell you they are legit  what more can you ask for, Juicy, tender, and meaty. The fries are unreal and so was the slaw. 
My friend ordered the catfish and shrimp which was legit as well. We also splurged for our fatness and had the pulled pork queso nachos. What a meal!"}
{"text":"The darling Orchid had a taste for barbecue chicken last night.  So, with the help of Yelp, I find Lucille's.  I made a reservation on their web site, but never got the confirmation text the web site said I'd get.  Nonetheless, off to Lucille's we go.  We get there, and a fellow at the desk (named \"Abel,\" if I remember correctly) found our reservation in his computer, even though his computer said we left no phone number.  He said he'd bring that up in their next meeting for Corporate webmaster.  (And a few bonus points for a \"we'll fix it\" before I could even say, \"I think it's broken.\")

Having never been in there before, it was a learning experience.  Our waiter, a very pleasant fellow named \"John,\" was patient with us as we asked questions from all over the map, trying to get a feel for the place.  The Orchid ordered a half-chicken-plus-two-meats (rib tips and pulled pork) with cole slaw, roasted garlic mashed potatoes and BBQ beans. (Platter comes with two; we paid a couple bucks extra for three.)  I ordered the same chicken-plus-two, with sausage and burnt ends, and mac-n-cheese and cheesy grits.  The burnt ends weren't really \"burnt,\" but they were good.  The sausage was a classic Louisiana hot link; not bad, but I have never been a fan of the texture.  Learning experience; I'll know better for next time.  The Orchid loved everything on her plate.

John, and the entire crew, all looked as though they liked their jobs, and they all seemed to have two speeds: \"fast\" and \"ZOOM-what-was-that?\".

All in all, a very enjoyable experience, albeit one that we won't indulge in frequently (the food is worth what you're paying, but you do pay handsomely). Well done.

{"text":"I went in the mid-afternoon and walked right in, but friends tell me this place has 90-minute waits on weekend nights. Why???

It's cute, in a kitsch sort of way. And the grits I had were undeniably good. But the 'cue was really sad. Smoked brisket shouldn't need a knife! And the pork ribs were bland and boring. All three of the sauces were sicky-sweet, and the portions were obscene -- the photo above is a lunch-size half order, and it was still way too much for one person."}
{"text":"Another stop during our vegas vacation. I had the tri tip sandwich and my wife had the brisket plate. Both had an amazing flavor and there were 3 different sauces at the table to try. The meats were very moist and tender with great smoke flavor. The sauces were all very good and cover a variety of preferences. Onion straws and dipping sauce were very tasty as well. And for a special treat if you have Colton(I think that's his name) he makes an amazing peach/watermelon tea combination a must try if you like peach and or watermelon tea!  Plus the atmosphere was very cool. If you like BBQ you probably will leave happy and very full!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Lucille's very much! Once they opened the location in summerlin I was stoked and sure enough my first meal (stl ribs Mac&greens) were bomb! So delicious I went back for seconds in the same week and I was disappointed, the ribs were tough, it just wasn't as good.. I was really pulling for them when I went back a third time after a long day of work(I just really wanted that same experience from the first meal) ugh I was utterly disgusted!!! The ribs were inedible, however it was so late at night at and I was exhausted I just chopped it up as a loss='(I pray the next time I go this doesn't happen again but when the food is good it's good that's why they get 3 stars"}

{"text":"Can't review the food as we couldn't even been served.  Went as a large party of 20. Incompetent hostess couldn't figure out how to seat us.  Once seated we were informed we have to be on one bill.  Have never been to a restaurant where they can't figure out how to serve a large party with separate checks.  Glad we left.  Kings Fish house next door. Even Better!"}
{"text":"Lucille's. Well I must say the portions were pretty huge. Their brisket was really good and also their barbecued baby back ribs. The gumbo however made me really sick when I got home and had been throwing up all night."}
{"text":"Loved this place... Best ribs we've had in long time. Kudos to  Ari our server -  he was polite,  professional & attentive server.   Cozy ambiance in bar area.  Wish there was one of these close to home.   May have to go back again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"What I had: Sweet Tea, Fried Pickles (appetizer), BBQ Sampler (entree) + 2 sides

Price: $40

Sweet Tea: GREAT, comes in a big Bass Mason Jar with actual fresh mint leaves in it. Most places don't go this far. Didn't even need a refill.

Fried Pickles: whole dill SPEARS fried. I honestly didn't like them as much because (1) The dills were too big. I prefer the little, oval shaped pickles (chips). (2) The fried outer shell falls off too easily. (3) They were incredibly hard to eat as they were to hard to pick up with a fork and too hot to touch with your hand. They were so hot, in fact, that when I bit into one, the juice came out and burned my tongue and lips. They weren't that great. the 2 dips (ranch, onion) was bland. \"Famous Dave's BBQ\" makes better fried pickles

BBQ Sampler: (1) Chicken: Juicy, no complaints (2) St. Louis Ribs: no complaints but I've had juicier ribs elsewhere that fall off the bone easily (3) Brisket: Good but it didn't have the TANGY taste of \"T.C.'s Rib Crib\" or the softness with extra BBQ of \"Famous Dave's BBQ\". the best part of Lucille's is the fact that they ACTUALLY grill all their food on an open flame and you can't hide that look, taste or feel. Most other places BAKE their so-called BBQ food. Their is a great deal of food, anough to feed 2, but I don't think it warrants a $30 price tag.

Mac-n-cheese (1 of 2 appetizers): Supposedly \"homemade\", it's GOOD but not great or not anything to write home about. \"T.C.'s Rib Crib\" has their own recipe and it's much better and \"Famous Dave's BBQ\" has a more \"zazzier\" mac.

Peanut Coleslaw: SUKT. it wasn't creamy at all. It tasted more like a cold salad with chopped peanuts on top. Greev Valley Ranch Feast Buffet has the best coleslaw.

(Freebie appetizer) Bread biscuit with honey/cinnamon/butter: Soft but dry. Their's doesn't compare to the taste of Memphis BBQs.

The Decor: this is where they shine. Their restaurant has a much more thematic southern feel than all others. The outside resembles the front porch of an old southern home while the 2 inside portions look like a Jazz/Blues Bar and a Southern restaurant on a sun deck

The waitresses/waiters: When I first walked in 2 waitresses CLEARLY saw me standing right in front of them right at the entrance which is shouldered on the left by the bar. Yet they acted like I was invisible. One of the ladies had a kid who (for some reason) was hanging out in the bar area!?!? The kid ran past me and jumped into his waitress mommy's arms as she CONTINUED to ignore me. I finally just walked past them and SAT MYSELF. Although I was sitting there with no FOOD menu, about 5 waiters walked past me, glancing at me but never stopping to take my order (not even my drink order) for a period of about 5 mins. the waitress that DID approach me was nice however (white or hipanic or mixed chick) short black ponytail. I thought the FIRST thing you do when a customer walks in is to seat them and hand them a menu??? Apparently they don't do that here.

Final Verdict: If you want better tasting \"Southern Style\" or \"Soul\" Food for a cheaper price try Famous Dave's, T.C.'s Rib Crib, or Memphis BBQ."}
{"text":"I know BBQ and I say this is the one of the best in the valley.  Melts in your mouth.  I AM NOT KIDDING.  The pink lemonade is really good.  After you eat here, you should go see a movie and let your body enjoy all the food that you have just consumed.  Worry tomorrow about the weight that you have added."}
{"text":"Food some one of the best in Vegas! And management is wonderful, u can be assured if u have any type of problem they will handle it promptly and professionally which is very unusual these days from corporate businesses! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Vegas who wants to get off the strip for some good food!"}
{"text":"This was so good the brisket was amazing and the mac and Cheese was the bomb. The mash potatoes were delicious"}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ place on the west side. The only downfall is the service is spotty. But we still brave it for the amazing food."}
{"text":"First time here and the restaurant itself is unique it had a real Southern feel but the service was not too hot. The waitress kept forgetting everything and wasn't very attentive. She finally came around towards the end of our visit but by then it was too late. The food was OK. I had the bbq shrimp but it tasted more like shrimp drowned in cocktail sauce and it was over priced... Probably won't come back blah"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and we always love the baby back ribs. The flavor is always consistent but the edges were tough to eat. They usually fall of the bone the one we had was burned & overcooked. Ordered corn bread for the first time and not a big fan at the place. The side of coleslaw was sour for me."}
{"text":"Lucille's smoke house right smack down in tempe marketplace who specializing in southern cajun meals. Walking into here was not really what i expected looking at it from the outside as i notice these patio tables with older table clothes (don't quote me on that). My first impression was amazing the stuff was super busy and they where still able to say hello as we walk in. My first impression was comforting and as i sat down waiting for our server the smell of a smoker came to us and to notice there is really look like there is a smoker right behind us which i would have never have seen if it wasn't for the smell.

Now 30min have passed and no server. I really should have gave this 3 stars but once are sever came it change.

Server- Simone was our sever and me and my wife can say she turn it all around. Not looking tired or stress she greeted us with a smile.  She was very honest and recommended dishes that we will like. Fast with drinks and also recommended beer right off the bat. Thanks for selling me on the 5 beers i had. Overall Simone was what made our and made this 5 stars

Food- Per Simone she recommended we get the bbq two meat combo which was amazing. Came with two side dishes and two meats, the beef ribs and tri tip where to die for. The mac and cheeses was amazing and the sweet corn was the best the we ended up buying two more side dishes. If any of you do decided to come here get the two meat combo it will fill you guys both up


Next time I'm down here hope Simone is here and will sure be back with groups of friend. 

Ask for Simone best sever i have ever had."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with a large party. Waiters and waitresses just could not get it together. About 20 minutes after we all ordered a different waiter than the one who actually took our order came by and asked us what we had ordered. -_______- It was like that throughout the whole dinner. It just seemed very unorganized. Service was slow and they kept forgetting a bunch of stuff. ***and when I say a large party I'm talking about 9 or 10 adults and 5 small children."}
{"text":"The family style meals are great. We can feed a family of six for under $100 and still take home a doggy bag."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!! I went there last night for dinner. No refills on my water, and I ordered a salad the waiter brought me dressing for my salad after I told her that she forgot to bring it. I was forced to eat a dry salad. The waitress never came back to my table until it was time to pay the bill. The was good but the service sucked. I will never return again."}
{"text":"service = poor (appetizers should not come out after the entrees !!!)

food = overpriced

will not be back - ever !!!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded our expectations. I had baby back ribs and tri tip with the jalapeño cheese grits and peanut slaw. The slaw had an Asian taste to it, but surprisingly still went well with BBQ. My husband had the beef ribs and sausage with Mac and cheese and loaded mashed potatoes. His meal was also fantastic. His sausage was so rich with cheese flavor, and all the meats were fantastic, tender and smokey. We thought it was pretty pricey for BBQ, but we will definitely be back. Absolutely everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place great smell of bbq when u walk in.....I ordered a hot link sandwich which was good lol but I will say the menu seemed a little over whelming and difficult to choose considering its a bbq place but over all great experience.. the waitress disappeared a lot tho and their bread and apple butter is aight but I like red lobsters free bread better lol"}
{"text":"Quiet and with a sense of southern backyard charm, I was pleasantly surprised the people-thirtsy Lucille's had such tasty food. Although on the expensive side, I thought of this BBQ joint similar to Olive Garden with its Italian food: affordable and fancy, but not gourmet.

You are offered their complimentary biscuits and cinnamon butter. I was not a fan of said butter. It made the already sweet biscuits sweeter. If you have children with an appetite, please, allow them to indulge at least. My waitress was gracious and efficient, quickly offering me my drink options ($3 for the largest Mason jar you've ever seen! Reminded me of Memphis, TN BBQ). No complaints there. It was after I ordered my food that it seemed to take ages for it to arrive. I felt the staff may have lost my request and kept anxiously glancing over towards the kitchen.

When you start running out of conversational topics, biscuit to stuff your face with AND you pull out your phone to start watching the latest episode of a series you're into, you know the wait was bad.

Lucille's smokes their meat in-house in a smoker right smack in the middle of the floor. My waitress was kind enough to inform me that I would taste the gaseous fumes, which I expected. Overall, the food was delicious and filling. Not only was everything fresh and well thought out, warm towels were brought out to satisfactorily clean my hands. Definitely beats the moist towelettes you get at other establishments.

Stop on in for a touch of Southern charm. Yee-haw!"}
{"text":"Love all their food , just tried their Louisiana  pasta . OMG !! Delicious!  Pure heaven .  Strawberry  lemonade just as fresh every time.  Can't get enough of their BBQ ribs with coen, mac and cheese and loaded garlic mashed potatoes . Did I mention their biscuits?  Yummy."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO DAMN GOOD! I ain't even mad about the price. If you read any of my yelp reviews, you know that I am a notorious cheapskate. But for Lucille's... SHUTUP AND TAKE MY MONEY! 

First, the atmosphere is all encompassing and full of 1920's-ish southern charm. My waiter was Ethan and he was super helpful! He recommended an awesome drink when we asked: half peach tea and half lemonade. It was delicious. We also got watermelon tea and half regular, which was also good. They come in huge mason jars with refills. We both ordered the tri-tip sandwich. It was PERFECT! They sauté the meat in the BBQ sauce and also it has some sauce on it, throughout the meat. (Versus dry meat with a blob of BBQ on top.) There are also 3 different types on every table if you need more (you won't) but the way they make it, you can taste the meat and the sauce perfectly. 

I got the garlic mashed potatoes (thanks to Ethan's suggestion) and my hubby got sweet potato fries. Both were delicious! At first I didn't think the sandwich and one side would be enough, but it was SO filling!  

Oh, also they give you super yummy biscuits and THE BEST brown sugar butter. Yes, better than Texas Roadhouse and better than the butter Lo-Lo's gives you too. In fact, I don't even like the butters from those two places. So I was pleasantly surprised when I couldn't get enough of the butter at Lucille's. They also give you hot towels at the end of your meal to wipe up with. Genius! 

The food was delicious, better than any other southern food I've had in the valley (which is the extent of my knowledge), they had excellent service, and the food came our super fast. We went on a packed Friday night and the service was just as good as if we had the place to ourselves."}
{"text":"They don't skimp on your entrees. The location is pretty awesome, even though it's always crowded, we always get seated almost immediately. Their hosts and servers are so friendly and you never have to ask for refills, they always deliver! Their bbq tri-tip is amazing, bbq chicken is juicy and full of flavor. Can't miss the Mac and cheese, I think this is their signature side dish, it's literally addicting. Don't get full on the fresh hot biscuits, that alone is a meal in itself. Overall Lucille's always delivers. Whenever you crave bbq, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"After leaving my last review on Lucille's, I was almost immediately contacted by Brad (Owner) who assured me that the less than spectacular visit we had was not the norm and he encouraged us to give them another try.  Well we did and this visit was a far better experience than our first, but not perfect.  We arrived and found it to be quite busy which was no big deal since we were told it would only be about 5-10 minutes before we were seated.  The hit this mark right on the money, but our seat would not have been our first choice, it was right by the kitchen which meant we got to deal with the traffic of servers during our meal.  It would have been nice if they asked if this was satisfactory, I would have gladly waited a few more minutes for a better table.  We were both hungry so we dealt with it.

Now for the food.  We thought it would be best if we ordered at least some of the food we had the first time.  My wife went with the brisket which like the first time was tender but did not have the smoky flavor one looks for when eating barbecue and again the potato was on the small side. Overall it was good, but not great.

I went with the burnt ends and tri-tip.  The tri-tip was again outstanding and very flavorful.  The burnt ends were far better than the first time.  They were still cut small, but this time were very tender and a joy to eat.  They, like the brisket, could have used a bit more smoke.

This visit was far more enjoyable than our first visit.  I still think they are a bit overpriced especially since there are other barbecue joints in town who's food is as good at a much better price.  Would we return?  Probably."}
{"text":"The family was going out to dinner and we wanted some ribs. There were a lot of people however the wait was not bad, 15 minutes. Everyone was heard having a great time. Our waitress Michelle was great. Took our order checked on us when needed. The ribs were delicious. The meat fell off the bones. We had a great time and will be back."}
{"text":"Looove this place! Food is excellent everytime! I was craving ribs during my last pregnancy and my husband brought this home without even asking!!! Soooo yummy. 
My husband and I come here on our date nights when we can too! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Weekends are usually packed, so if you don't want to wait then try it during the week."}
{"text":"My family has been looking for a replacement for our favorite BBQ restaurant that closed down years ago and Lucille's comes pretty darn close to our favorite.  Their BBQ is delicious and we love their Pulled Pork Con Queso!  A must if you enjoy BBQ!"}
{"text":"Go to place if you want to listen to Blues and some ribs at the same time.  Applicable only after 9pm."}
{"text":"Jess and McKenzi were amazing behind the bar! We had great service and yummy food! 

We will definitely be back for more southern hospitality, great BBQ, and fun drinks"}
{"text":"Went here by myself for lunch to \"try it out\" I am a bbq lover BUT I saw they had a chicken breast w/ gravy and mashed potatoes and could not pass it up.
It was AMAZING I was so full I did not eat the veggies..well who needs veggies when you have those amazing biscuits w/apple butter..
To bad it is so far away from where I live I can't go as often as I want to but next chance I get I WILL be there.."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. The food is always good, no complaints there. But today our server was a little slow. She was very sweet but just slow. And we were there on a Tuesday for lunch so it wasn't busy. Took a while for my boyfriend to get his beer, but this wasn't the servers fault. We saw her standing at the bar waiting for it while the bartender was watching tv & making idle conversation with a couple seated at the bar. 

Also I had to ask her twice for a to-go cup for my sweet tea and by the time she brought it, my tea was almost gone. She didn't offer to fill up the to-go cup with fresh tea. 

Like I said, I like the food here, but service needs to improve."}
{"text":"Fried chicken lunch special is the best deal @ 7.99. Very good white cream gravy. Just make sure to ask for extra.

Their baby back ribs are the best ribs in the valley!

Dinner is more pricey, but great food as well.

One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"The feel of Lucille's Smokehouse is a typical version of a Louisiana bayou shack on steroids as viewed through the eyes of a Wall Street investment banker. Lots of kitch, but charming all the same.

The good news is that the food is really terrific! Southern barbecue and home style side dishes that make your tastebuds stand up and take notice. The selection is amazing as well with items like Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw, Southern Braised Green Beans and Creamy  Cheese Grits to please even a grits-hater like myself.

The barbecue is wonderful, with full smokey flavor and a nice selection os sauce styles to add if you wish. And they even know how to make REAL southern Sweet Tea without making it taste like tea flavored syrup.

Where Lucille's fails is that they themselves like their food far too much. All of their barbecue offerings are nearly $5.00 more than any place else in town. A dinner bill that for us would be about $35.00 else where cost more than $50.00 at Lucille's.

Bottom line is if you like really good barbecue and don't care how much you pay, come to Lucille's. Your tummy will thank you, even if your wallet doesn't.

*******************************************************************************

Not 24 hours after posting this review I received an e-mail from Brad the owner at Lucille's agreeing with me that they were a touch expensive. Saying that it is due to the quality of their meats and the size of their portions. (Which by the way are massive! Our meals at Lucille's are always great but always generate lots of left-overs too! Yum!)

 I understand these reasons completely of course and wanted to assure all of you Yelpers that while prices may be a bit higher, the food is very much worth it. We keep Lucille's set aside for more special dinning since we cannot afford to go here too often.

I was so impressed by Brad's candor in his e-mail that I am adjusting our rating of Lucille's up one star! Thanks for the note Brad."}
{"text":"Went there and was blown away by how terrible it was. I went on a Friday night with some friends got our drinks quickly then it took forever to get an order put in. I tried the back porch platter. on hour later when I got my food it was not the correct order they gave me brisket instead of tri-tip  Which I pointed out to the waitress and she said she wasn't sure but she would check and that was the last we saw of her until 30 minutes later when we got our bill. we couldn't even get anything else to drink. My ribs were such dried out boot leather that I had a hard time sawing through them with the steak knife that they brought out with my friends order. If I could give no stars I would. There are a lot better places in the valley for both service and bbq."}
{"text":"I guess I'll never know how wonderful the food is! I had a rather bad experience with this place, couple of weeks ago. We ordered one of the Ribs combo's & before we could get started with eating, a man pushes a cart load of raw bloody meat & parks it right in front of us!!! This was most unexpected for us since I had no prior warning about this. Apparently we were seated in front of their large barbque grill & had to witness this unpleasant sight. To me, this was more than I could take - looks like carnage! I have stopped eating meat since. 

The hostess was most apologetic but what beats me is.. when you are ready to be seated, they ask if you prefer the outdoors, an indoor booth or  a regular table. But nobody asked us if we are ready to sit near the grill where they showcase large quantities of raw meat enough to feed a small country! I have requested them to be kind enough to warn their customers - particularly the new one's that may not be well informed about this practice."}
{"text":"I thought because this place has been open for so long and because the prices a bit high that the food would be excellent. We went last night and we were both disappointed. We don't think any of the food we ordered was worth the price or anything special.  I had the brisket and it was dry unless I put sauce on it. The grits and sweet potato fries were the best part of my meal.  My husband had the tri tip and it was also dry. The macaroni and cheese side was so very bland. The biscuits were nothing special and the butter they served with them tasted funny. I liked they had a few craft beers on tap that I like and the live music in the lounge was nice. Next time we want bbq though we won't be eating here."}
{"text":"Nice place to stop in for a beer and some BBQ. Visiting from TX and I'm pretty particular about my BBQ. The brisket is decent, the baby back ribs are good, but the sides are amazing along with the buttermilk biscuits and apple butter they give you while you wait. Great selection of local craft beers on tap. Bartender Aprille is very nice, helpful, and an awesome bartender. Will definitely return if I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"So here I am, me and two of 
My bfff's..just got done golfing 18 holes in 108 degrees. Needless to say we're all starving and thirsty.. After what felt like an hour we finally decided on some BBQ. Now we know plenty of hidden BBQ gems  throughout Phoenix but today we decided on Lucile's. So we get there and be bolt right intothe bar section due to the fact the NFL preseason game is on and it's not packed like the regular dining area. So we get greeted by our waiter, I ask him a simple question \" what's the difference between tri-tip and brisket?\" he replies confidently, \" tri tip is a leaner cut from the muscle in the back, and brisket is a shoulder cut, which has more fat. Both very good'\" he added.so I go with the tri tip, my one friend gets the brisket and the other gets a steak. ...out comes the food.. Surprisingly mine looks like the brisket along with my buddies, but mine is cut differently. I ignore the appearance and dig in. I immediately notice the amount of fat throughout each cut. I think to myself \" did this fucker mess up my order?\" I ask my friends and they just think I'm talking out my ass but I know my cuts of meat and this shit ain't no tri-tip. So I ask a random Waiter what my dish looked like to him and he said tri-tip! WTF?? Hmmm that's weird! Now my friends really think I'm talking out my ass but I know
I'm right, this is not what I ordered. I start thinking crazy thoughts like \"is this some
Sort of tri-tip Conspiracy?\" I continue to eat what I did not order flabbergasted.. ..out come the check...the waiter begins passing out the checks since we had them separated. He passes the steak check to friend 1. Passes brisket check to friend 2. Now he passes mine without looking. I immediately open to see BRISKET. I experience mix emotions. I am pissed because I Knew he had fucked up And I'm happy Because I just confirmed I'm not crazy and I really
Do know my cuts of meat! I notice my waiters name \"Tad\" and understood why he didn't tell us his name. I bring this conspiracy up to Tad and he stated \" I'm so sorry man do you wanna see my boss?\" I reply \"no thank you\". Overall I confirmed the staff at Lucile's do not know there cuts of meat and their bar service is really poor. Eat in the dining room and watch out for Tad bc he sucks."}
{"text":"11 minutes for someone to greet us, or even acknowledge our existence & 7 minutes for our waitress to bring us our drinks.

11. Minutes. ELEVEN. MINUTES. That is crazy. Our server didn't even realize we were sitting there until the host saw we were still waiting. Our server greeted, brought drinks & put in a food order for a table that sat next to us just a second before we were seated. Another table that was seated 10 minutes after us, had drinks & started ordering appetizers. Trust me, I get it if you're in the weeds when you're serving, but you need to have some sense of urgency. Looked like she was only taking care of 4 tables, all parties of 2-4, I don't see what the problem was. Nonetheless, she was a very sweet server & smiled. 

But the food is amazing, as always. By the way, the onion straws are so good! A half order is huge, so unless you're with a large party, I wouldn't get a full order.

Oh & they forgot to bring out our cornbread, which we totally forgot about cause we didn't get it until we were finished with our food. The corn bread: 2/5 eh."}
{"text":"wth?! why does Lucille's only have 3 stars?! this place is amazingly delicious and I'm glad I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming here.

So let's make this short... I got the tri-tip sandwich and mac and cheese since the waiter suggested both. It was amazing!!!! The meat was sooo good, and the sauces were delish. I have never had mac and cheese that delicious in my life. Also, I don't know why people are saying the prices are high.. it seemed pretty standard for a sit down restaurant. 

Anyways, I'm 8 months pregnant and since Lucille's, bbq has become my new obsession!! I've never had bbq from the south or anything, but I've tried a couple other bbq places around the area and I have yet to find a place as good as Lucille's."}
{"text":"I loveeeee Lucille's! It is pricey, but in my opinion, it's worth it. The sweet bread they bring you is just to die for. And let's not forget the Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes!!! To be fair, I don't have much BBQ wisdom so I don't know what to compare it to, but it's pretty darn good to me. 
This place makes for a nice summer date night. Keep in mind, if you bring your whole family, the price will add up quick. If price isn't a concern, there's bound to be something for everyone (...except for vegans maybe??) 

P.S. +10 points from me automatically for serving lemonade in a cute mason jar"}
{"text":"Great service, great food during the Golden Knights game. Better option than yard house next door as their staff has gone to crap. Sat down immediately, had a server right away. Only gripe, the bar needs to upgrade their 10+ year old big TV. Couldn't see the guys numbers it's so blurry."}
{"text":"I've been to Lucille's more than once.. this is probably visit #3.  I'm not a BBQ fan or a big meat eater.. but the man is.

This evening, we decided to subject my little sister and her family to BBQ eatin' out in AZ during our visit.  The place was quick to seat us, but I don't have much to say about the service.. it was slow to go.  We also had kids at our table and they were kept occupied by the various crayons and drawing paper offered.

Meals ordered and experience:
Jambalaya - Too spicy.  It was like a bowl of cayenne pepper.
BBQ Shrimp - Not too bad.. but a bit on the wet side (?)  
Fried Chicken & Mashed Potatoes - the hubby enjoyed and LOVED his fried chicken.  Mashed potatoes were delishish.
Blackened Catfish - not too bad.. but the collared greens that came with it were way too overdone... maybe that's the way they are supposed to be?  Catfish was MEH.  What more does one have to say about catfish?  It was spiced nicely.. but it still had the \"food produced in mass\" feeling.
Kids Meals - No comment here.  Kids meals are kids meals

The experience was okay.. I can honestly say that I felt it was no different than going to an Outback Steakhouse, Elephant Bar or similar type restaurant.  The specialty is BBQ.. but I feel they are the \"good at BBQ\", but \"master of none\".  So it's a good experience for the hubs who likes that kind of food.

Bonuses:  The basket of biscuits with apple butter.  These were very good and I absolutely love them.  I think I should have just ate these for dinner.  The free refills, if you can ever get past the 32 oz jar of drink they give you...

But for my sister, brother in law and myself.. It's somewhat forgettable."}
{"text":"The food is always so delicious! The Texas Brisket sandwich is to die for! We've always had fantastic experiences at this location. The menu has such a fantastic selection of all different types of food. We were just there about a half hour or so ago. Our waiter, Matt, was incredibly attentive and he went our of his way to make sure we were enjoying our food. Our mason jars were always full of refreshments. Matt truly is an asset to this fine establishment! We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food was ok I guess, my Fiancé had a steak that was so-so but she loved her Steak. My mom had Tri-tip that she wasn't very fond of, I had the brisket that was ok. Nothing really jumped at me like it was high quality BBQ, save the money you would spend here and go too Famous Daves for a cheaper but better tasting experience"}
{"text":"I walked in during Lunch/Happy Hour (3:30pm exactly) on a Monday. The initial server, Danielle, was horrible  we didn't even get seated we had to seat ourselves.  I had to go back to the hostess to get menus!! That is when our initial server came to take our drink order. There was no introduction or anything she just said what do you want to drink (no eye contact EVER made throughout the entire time here). I ordered two waters with lemon and was going to order a margarita and she literally walked off while we were talking. Following this incident, they tried to move us away from happy hour to be serviced. Why should we have to move to have our order taken if we were directed to sit here? After we had a change of 3 more different servers. Not to mention it took AN HOUR to receive any good. Wow. Cannot believe it. I would like to add that server Cody was exceptional despite our horrible experience here."}
{"text":"Not inexpensive and very loud when it is very busy which is pretty much every night.  We enjoyed it and will certainly return,"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ever had the mardis gra chicken before with a backporch lemonade? AMAZING! all fresh HOMEMADE side here nothing processed or fake at all. This is the hands down spot for comfort food at tempe market place! If you haven't been here before then ad it to the list!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed that you've taken the chicken wings off the menu. 
I probably would have been less disappointed if they weren't SO good. 
I'm shocked they'd be gone. 
They were my favorite thing on the menu and the best wings anywhere around. 

I'm so sad. Shame on y'all. 

The waitstaff are still awesome though."}
{"text":"Just had our first meal at Lucille's Bar-B-Que located at Tempe Market Place. I had the Pulled Pork with Sweet Potato Fries. My husband had the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich and Fries. We were both very satisfied with the QQP (Quality,Quantity&Price) of our selections. This being our first time at Lucille's we opted to do a lunch as this is generally less spendy than dinner.  We will be returning to try out some of the Dinner menu items as we noticed some Cajun dishes that we feel need to be tried. Don't know if Great tasting Bar-B-Que & Southern Fried Chicken will carryover to Good Cajun food but we will try it and see. Another plus is everyone we dealt with was Friendly, Courteous & Helpful."}
{"text":"Great service experience, decent food, but a little bit pricey for BBQ.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and sat at a booth within a minute or two.  The smoked brisket was good, but a little fatty for me.  My wife had the Mardi Gras chicken which I think I will get next time.  It was excellent fresh, but also really good as leftovers the next day.  

I also noticed from where we were sitting that the server greeted some customers as they came in and sat them when the hostess was occupied with other customers.  Good to see teamwork on the service side."}
{"text":"Love the big portions and location of the new Lucilles!!! The hosts were great and the service was ok! I have always loved Lucille's back in the south at but once I moved to Vegas the only one I could find was in Henderson. They were smart to open one up near the southwest/ summerlin area !"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place averages 3 stars. What's wrong with people?

This is my favorite BBQ spot for many reasons. I know, you might be asking yourself, why then no 5 stars? Well, there's always a waiting list that takes too long but they have empty tables. It seems that they haven't being able to figure out how many waiters/waitresses they need. 4th of July waiting time: 1 hour. They didn't say that the patio waiting time was 15 min and that in the bar is first come first serve.

Anyways, there's nothing not to like of the food. The wings were tasty, the ribs were great, their bbq sauces are full of flavor, and the price is right.

All in all, my very favorite bbq joint in AZ."}
{"text":"Buen lugar para una BBQ
La comida buena y en su justa medida.
El servicio genial, el lugar tambien frente al Grren Valley Station Casino.
El precio quizas un pelin alto para la categoria del lugar, por lo demas muy bien. No obstante ya sabes, ve y dejanos tu comentario.
Saludos"}
{"text":"Normally one of our favorite places to go. We decided to split a salad and our favorite southern fried chicken. We kept waiting for our salad and actually saw it waiting to be served for 10 minutes. Of course it came out with our entree. 

Our waiter Mike blamed us for not telling him we wanted the salad first. Since the shrimp was cold we sent it back and got attitude the rest of the meal. 

Sad experience."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to meet some friends for lunch.
It is located in Tempe Market place but, has its own parking lot,which makes going here much easier than a lot of other places here.
We sat on the back patio which was so nice. It is a nicely decorated place, Very Southern. It reminds me of a place in Florida or in the South.
Well ,it was a lovely day outside,not too hot or cool so it was great for sitting outside.

We got fried green tomatoes for appetizer, which was really good and the first time I had ever had them.
I had the BBQ chicken Salad, Sue got the breaded and fried cat fish with shrimp ,it also came with Sweet potatoes fries. She said it was fantastic, my other friend Alan got the fried Chicken and he is from Mississippi and it was very true to how they do it there.
Bathrooms are nice and clean.Nice Hot water to wash off all the sticky BBQ.
Staff is a little frazzled at times, there seems to be a bit of disorganization going on.
2 of us received our food and Sue waited quite a while to get hers as well.
She did have the Strawberry Lemonade which she thought was Heaven."}
{"text":"Wow everything was really good but the BBQ chicken was AMAZING, maybe the best we've ever had. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!! Friendly staff. Big portions and tasty baby back ribs. The deep fried shrimp was crispy and moist. Warm biscuits was a nice start too!"}
{"text":"After seeing the yelp reviews I was expecting better BBQ. I did grow up in California...where Santa Maria style seasoning and tri-tip was perfected...so maybe I expected too much from Lucille's?

It's got a blues meets barn flare. They have a happy hour from 3-7 during the week.
I would recommend beer: Lucille's beer was surprisingly good! We (three of us) tried the amber, hef and one of the other Lucile's beers all very good. $4.5 for 22oz beer is pretty cheap.

Food: the rolls and apple butter are by far the best thing on there!!! The spinach dip is good, not great; brisket sliders not so good; pickle spears ok; rib tips pretty good. 

Service was nice and helpful. Maybe a little over sat...but she did well.

Probably wouldnt recommend this to any of my friends or family. Much better places out there."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the food here.  Also great beer selections.  Coming from the South, I love me a good fried green tomatoes and these were spectacular.  Grandma would be proud.  For dinner I had the brisket and portabella sandwich and it was fantastic.  My wife had the pulled pork which in my opinion is the linchpin of any great BBQ joint.  It was good, not the best I've ever had by any means but quite good.  As far as BBQ places go in the Phoenix area, this place has been the best so far.  The cole slaw wasn't that great however."}
{"text":"Great food...poor service in the bar area. Early before the lunch rush. The bartender ignored out table as if it was a bother to have to serve us. After our table being avoided for 10 min. And a rude response from the bartender we got up and left. Had a great lunch and service at Panera Bread Cafe...just next door."}
{"text":"I love the food, but it is too pricey.  I only come here once every year or two, since I can BBQ in my backyard for a fraction of this price.  Aside from the price, this is a wonderful place to go!!  The waitress I had last time was extremely friendly.  I wish I remembered her name, but she had the best customer service!!  :)"}
{"text":"The place has a good vibe. The food, phenomenal. The service was awesome, the girl knew her job and was full of energy, young people working but don't let their age fool you."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review and my first time eating at Lucille's. I was blown away. I'm not a fan of BBQ joints and was skeptical about getting a salad from one. I had the Cajun shrimp and avocado salad with one of their biscuits. Both were amazing. The shrimp were well seasoned and tender (how do you get them to spiral?). The biscuit was soft, fluffy, and melted in my mouth. They are sweet and I was not expecting that, but it's not overboard. They manager on duty  (Trevor or Troy... I think it was Tyler) was so nice and helpful. Next time I'm taking taking my husband. I think he would appreciate it more being that he loves BBQ."}
{"text":"you know i have been going to this place for over a decade, awesome employees very clean and food has been somewhat amazing..last few times not so much prices higher portions smaller and i ordered the famous bbq chicken salad which now comes with smoked chicken.....awful....i was told by a mgr i should have ordered it the old way...Really??? so you make it a new way that sucks to save money  the chicken was tasteless ...next time i order i guess i have to ask more questions....upper mgmt should leave a great dish alone...why change a customer favorite ...luckily you have an awesome staff."}
{"text":"Best place ever! We moved to be closer to this place, well and a better location but still because of this place! We really like there atmosphere, live music in the bar on Fridays DURING happy hour. Food is always spot on and the drinks are great, try the watermelon jalapeno or the back porch lemonade. The best part of this place is the sweet potato fries though, to die for. We bring all of our out of town visitors here and they always have a great time."}
{"text":"Well , the smell of BBQ got my attn. looks like a good place to go. Got me the St. Louis Smoked ribs very good , but after that whoa the Potato something soup, boy very salty and to much pepper. The Peach Lemonade was good but got to ask for water to wash it down very very sweet. The Buffalo Wings tasted if they showered them with salt . My Wife's Cheese burger no flavor on the patty the buns were too sweet. I was like , either everything is sweet or salty... I order other appetizers but it didnt click ... Took my brother and wife from S.D. I kinda felt bad and it just click to me ,this ain't the South it's Phoenix..... came out  paying almost $ 150 for 4 people. First and Last for me and won't envite my freinds or family....."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food! The wait can be long if you have a large group but it's worth it! It is expensive but I really enjoy the food so when I am in the mood to spoil myself I hit up Lucille's!"}
{"text":"Great service midday and able to sample the creamy coleslaw and peanut coleslaw before picking my sides. Wish there was a cubical seating to hide my shame of inhaling BBQ. Delicious but messy. Warm cloth towel provided at the end but not during."}
{"text":"Pork ribs were amazing and so was the Cole slaw! Service started out slow but finished strong.  We had two people who are kosher and they were so accommodating!  Kudos for that!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.

I ordered the southern fried chicken and split it with a friend. To my surprise, it's BONELESS! Utterly unacceptable. The only thing going for it was the mashed potatoes and the boneless chicken was moist. The side veggies were too salty.

Mediocre at best, and did I mention  everything's super expensive? If u want good bbq, go to little miss! I would not come back unless I have to."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We started off with onion strings, which are perfectly made. For dinner we had ribs and chicken. Sides we had mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and coleslaw. (there were about 12 family members so dont judge me haha) 

I could do without the coleslaw... tastes more like coledont. The restaurant is super loud, so take your anxiety medication before coming here. All in all I had a good experience and will be back again."}
{"text":"After a bit of a wait, the 2 of us were seated and passed off to the waitress. She seamed to have some difficulty in keeping the drinks full. Twice she asked if I need a refill and I never did get one. Then the dried out meatless ribs and ice cold tri-tips, arrived and I could hardly for the 65.00 bill."}
{"text":"Over cooked catfish with bad flavor.  Rocks in my yard are softer.  WAYYYY over cooked. This is isnt catfish. Made me sick had to stop eating and throw away.   Ribs were just as bad.  Worst experience in my life.  Orderd from Uber and hope they drop that restaurant.NEVER AGAIN.  I am sick to my stomach from over fried, over cooked food.  Catfish should not be DARK brown and hard as a rock on the inside.  Will call health department if i get food poisining.  For what i paid, should've went to Carls Junior.  Now I nave to go buy a new meal and be out more ,money to feed family,SUCKS SUCKS SUCKS

Oh yeah.....ribs were burnt and couldnt tear off the bone with a saw"}
{"text":"We came here for the VegiBurger. (yes I know its a BBQ Joint). We were not disappointed! Fantastic VegiBurger! The best I have tried so far in Las Vegas.(Yes, better by far, than the bocaburger from Johnny Rockets- which is good in a pinch). The vegiburger had roasted onions and cheese(not vegi-cheese FYI- I'm not that militant), a wonderful bun and was sooo very yummy with every bite.
My hubby and his friend ordered some ribs and sausage which they shared along with a GIGANTIC Cobb Salad(more than enough for 5-6 people FYI)and they took home the rest. (What is up with the Gigantic portions here?). 
Loved the biscuits and the sweet iced tea.
Definitely a winner."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and promptly asked our choice of beverage. As this was our first time visiting this establishment we took our time looking at the menu. We ordered a the original pulled pork sandwich and the back porch which came with chicken, baby back ribs and tri tip.

The pulled pork sandwich was half pulled pork, half fat. In the end it had good flavor.

The back porch was a mix of thoughts. The chicken was delicious. The tri tip was average. The baby back ribs were extremely dry.

Honestly for $60 I would not recommend this place. Food was just not what was expected."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. The portions are very large, so you'll have extra to take home. Been here more time than I can count."}
{"text":"Took my beautiful daughter there for happy hour. I have been there before for dinner with my hubby and wasn't too impressed, but it was her choice. So, we sat in the bar at a high top table. One of the main things we like about Lucille's is the funky/retro decor. It is really cool. We would love to have a room like the one with the rattan furniture- my grand aunt DID have one like it with a canary too! 

I got a Joe's hurricane, it was good. Our waiter, who was also the bartender brought us biscuits. The are good, but not great. They are served with a cinnamon butter, no honey or plain butter, but you can probably ask for some. We ordered a side of veggies which were wonderful! They were green beans, red bell pepper, onion, etc cooked to perfection in a nice butter sauce. They were not rubbery or too crisp, not mushy either, just right! We also got sweet potato fries which came with a garlic mayo, I am not a fan of mayo so opted for the ranch dressing on some or just plain- I like them that way.  The 2 items we got were good, but I am not a fan of their BBQ sauces so would not go there for BBQ."}
{"text":"Good bbq for a good price. It's not my favorite bbq place but they do a good job. They offer greens, which I like because it's good soul food that goes well with their bbq.

I've ordered various dishes but I do like their bbq chicken, very moist and tender. If you like fried pickles, they do a great version. 

One thing I like about this place is 4th of July. Make a reservation ahead of time. Then after your fill, walk across the street to Green Valley casino to watch the fireworks. It's not 'Murica unless you have fireworks with your bbq!"}
{"text":"Service: very good. Our server was attentive and friendly and everything came out in a timely manner.

Atmosphere: went in for an early dinner, bout 5ish and we were seated within 5 min. Cute decor, very southern style feeling with a fun vibe.

Food: everything we ordered was amazing. Finger licking good. Started with the burnt end pieces (can't remember the name but it's from the appetizers) and it was so so so good. Also got the friend okra which was also delicious. I ordered the blackened catfish with mashed potatoes and veggies and I loved it. It was blackened perfectly! I had them out the sauce in the side in case I didn't care for it. My bf ordered the backyard favorite (not sure if that was the exact name) which came with ribs, chicken and some other meat. I tasted all three and they were awesome!! 
I don't think you can go wrong with any of the items on their menu. Would love to go back especially since it is too hot here to BBQ yourself."}
{"text":"My first time here and the food was was wonderful. The only complaint I would have is that the room I chose to sit in was really cold and it made my food get cold faster. If you ever visit this place you must order the wings for an appetizer, they were very scrumptious. I also had the full rack baby back ribs which were very good but I have had better. The meat was lacking a little. They have the best southern greens I have ever tasted and I can just eat that all day.  I totally recommend this joint."}
{"text":"I have 4 words. Burnt Ends. Banana pudding. So good. The patio was nice. Service was good and the drink was STRONG! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas! I tried the Henderson location, and now last Saturday the Summerlin location. The staff was very helpful and friendly. 
The food is amazing! The portions are big! I think I have tried most of their meats, and I absolutely love everything! 
We love riding our Indian Motorcycle out there and enjoy a meal in that beautiful atmosphere. 
During our last visit there, I especially liked that one of the managers was able to tell me the story of why 'Lucille's' is called 'Lucille's'. 
Very very nice place! I can recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The moment you walk in the smell is heavenly. There's a nice bar where I have come after work to have a couple drinks. The lunch specials are great. The baked potato with a side salad is amazing!  (Only served during lunch) I ordered the burnt ends salad during my last visit. I wasn't too impressed. But everything else I have ever ordered was delicious!  The brisket burnt ends appetizer along with the onion strings are on point!  Service during lunch is a little slow, but probably because I'm usually in a rush. Customer service is also great!

Don't forget the complimentary biscuits with apple butter!  Very thick and fluffy. Might get you full before your meal but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this establishment for a long time now.  I think their BBQ is great, but not the best.  I've had a variety of different dishes.  

Pulled pork-above average
Brisket-above average
Burned Ends-Excellent
Pork Ribs-average.


The best item they have on the menu is their Beef ribs.  Oh my.  You cant get beef ribs at a lot of bbq joints, but Lucilles have the best in the valley.  They used to charge by half a rack or a full rack, now they charge by the bones.  (3,5,7)  The prices have gone up alot recently, but still you can't get beef ribs anywhere else that's close to theirs.

The sides are ok, nothing to rave about.  The biscuits are good with the cinnamon butter.

Also the strawberry lemonade is amazing.  It's like crack in a mason jar.  It's the best."}
{"text":"Miss the original biscuits. Cutting cost??? Love the BBQ chicken salad except it's very lonely without the biscuit."}
{"text":"THE BOMB! It could be that I am pregnant and my taste buds go crazy over BBQ or this place is just plain GOOD!

We ordered the Backyard Feast for 89.99. It was more than enough to feed 4 adults and a child. The baby back ribs were very succulent. So much that writing about it is making my mouth water. For sides we ordered roasted garlic mashed potatoes, southern braised greens, macaroni and cheese, and fried. OH cant forget to mention that the homemade biscuits with apple butter is so good. All the sides were fresh and importantly, good LOL

We went on a Saturday night and the wait was not bad at all. We got our drinks a few minutes after we sat down. After we made our order, we received the sides and order within 10 - 15 minutes. 

The only bad thing about this place was that there were people smoking at the entrance and I thought that it was very rude because there was a smoking area a few yards away from the door. So if you smoke please be considerate and smoke in the designated area. Kids and people who are pregnant don't want second hand smoking. I give it a three star because of this. I couldn't enjoy sitting outside in the patio area without smelling the smoke. Also parking sucks here."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints... The food is great and prices reasonable for the restaurant, not an everyday kind of thing. ..  I almost always come here with my boyfriend when we feel like having a great dinner night out...located right at tempe marketplace, you can walk right to the theater from there. I always order water with lemon at restaurants, but here it has to be the sweet tea...the huge mason jars with mint are a great combo...yummy:) 
The weekdays are quieter, but on the weekend they have a band playing the blues, so I dont' mind waiting for a table while listening to the music. 
The place is very comfortable, the staff is always helpful and welcoming.. 

The smoked chicken pasta is delicious, they used to have a pork chop plate with a tasty glaze and a sweet potato pancake, which was a favorite, but it's no longer served:( I don't know why i'm even mentioning it, but guess we both can't have it anyway, sweet memory i guess...haha

Fried green tomatoes very good as well for a starter, if you order the rib tip as a starter you might not have room left for main course,They have huge portions so expect to take some home or share with someone. My boyfriend usually orders the catfish or steak, he's never had complaint- had a few bites myself, they are both really good.. The gumbo and jambalaya are very tasty and spicy, but more hot sauce never hurts....

All in all, the place is relaxing, the food is great And the staff is very friendly.."}
{"text":"Im from texas so I feel I'm a tough critic on BBQ but this is the spot for BBQ in the Henderson area the best"}
{"text":"The food is just so great! 
Our waiter AUSTIN just topped it off  
Made sure we enjoyed our food didn't make us feel rushed after we finished our dinner. He went above and beyond ! I can honestly say my boyfriend and i were satisfied. 
We usually get there AMAZING ribs but can never go wrong with there nachos (definitely an appetizer for two)"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome!! All of the food taste like 
Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, & Harriet Tubman cooked it! There is so much culture in the food! The juicy goodness of everything was mouth watering. It was like making love on your plate!!! Over and over and over again!! I've been to a lot of barbecue places but I'd have to say this was the best barbecue I've ever had!!!! I had a long week of work and eating here has made my day off magical! So from a foodie to the rest of you foodies please try this place is is amazing! This place brought out the soul in me. I am speaking with Martin Luther King Jr.'s voice! He is speaking through me to tell yall to come eat here now!!!"}
{"text":"7 min and no one can to gave us water. The sad part is that no one here. May be 30 people it 148 pm . Just to sad I will not come back."}
{"text":"BEST LUCILLE'S ANYWHERE!! From Cali and been to many Lucille's  but this location tops the cake!! Thanks Henderson Team!!"}
{"text":"It didn't even receive a 1 star but it's a required field!!  We came here to celebrate our Easter Sunday with the family.  We had 3 adults and 2 kids.  Being that it was Easter Sunday, we knew that it was probably going to be busy and just as expected we waited for 25 minutes to be seated.  After we were seated, the lady who sat us had a bad attitude.  Being that we just got out of church, we let it go.  We ordered and I was looking forward to tri-tip BBQ with cheesy grits and braised greens.  After about 30 minutes, we noticed that the larger party who were seated much later than us, were getting their orders.  So we asked our server about our food and he told us it was because the kiddie burger was ordered well done and so it takes a little longer.  After another 30 minutes, we asked again and this time we were told it's because they are short handed.  Our food started coming one by one and each plate were cold.  My aunts fried catfish was cold and fries were cold and stale.  My tri-tip BBQ platter was cold, the cheesy grits was cold and so was the braised greens.  In fact, the braised greens was so cold that butter was clumping.  The well done kiddie burger was cold with stale fries.  We couldn't believe they even served it!!  We talked to the manager and she was going to fix it.  We waited for another 45 minutes and still no food.  We were so hungry that we just walked out.  This ruined our Sunday afternoon!  Shame on you Lucille's BBQ!!  Terrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my food, and it was expensive. The decorations are tacky. I went here based on a friend's recommendation. I have to believe he was playing me for a fool. Otherwise, I'll never trust his recommendation again. 

I may be too harsh. It's my fault for ordering the Nashville chicken instead of bbq at a bbq joint. But why would it be so heavily advertised if the restaurant did not think it was good? The world is a strange and terrible place. Personal responsibility is the worst."}
{"text":"We returned to eat after a very poor experience.  Everyone deserves a second chance, right?  Our server, Paulina, was wonderful.  She promptly greeted us and maintained extremely wonderful service throughout our visit.  This is the Lucille's we have grown to love!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! I definitely recommend any of the steaks but not the ribs. The staff is friendly but not very attentive. The ambiance was fine, nothing special. The 4 stars were based on the food not so much anything else."}
{"text":"One of our favorite BBQ joints. Had the Back Porch which was huge & delicious. The kids loved it too. Our server, Alfonso, was wonderful. Very friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuummmmyyy, 2nd best ribs in Vegas and their biscuits and sweet butter is out of this m$&@\"/;&in world! Lol"}
{"text":"I have been to Lucille's many times and it is one of my all time favorite restaurants. The complimentary biscuits with apple cinnamon butter are AMAZING!! 

I always order a full rack of baby back ribs and take the rest home. The leftovers make for a great treat later or the next day. This time I ordered the baby back ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and shoestring fries. Everything was delicious.

Lucille's also serves the best strawberry lemonade, which comes in an old school jar! The backporch strawberry lemonade is also really good (strawberry lemonade with vodka).

It was my friend's birthday so they have him a little sundae with a candle, which was kind of neat. Only reason I gave this place 4 stars is because service could have been better. Our waiter didn't seem too happy, or maybe he was just busy. Not bad service, but not great either.

We will be back."}
{"text":"I wasn't too sure about this place. Being that there are to many disappointing BBQ restaurants. I am used to having great BBQ and soul food home cooked. Never had to go out to a restaurant  for this goodness but now that I live in Vegas with it only being my boy friend and I, it would be wayy too much to cook for just two people. So my manager told me about this place. She said she will have Lucille's catered to our Christmas party so my boy friend and I decided to give it a shot before then. 

We service was nice. Very friendly but a too perky. That didn't make me feel the southern hospitality I was looking for. It made me feel more like I was in a Laguna Beach Cafe. But, I must say the waitress was very helpful when it came to menu knowledge being that it was our first time at Lucille's. We ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with 2 sides and a side of hot link. For the two sides we chose french fries and baked beans. I liked the spicy flavor in the bakes beans, although I didn't like that they were a little hard or under cooked. The ribs were very tasty and fell off the bone. The hot link was amazing. Reminded me of the hot links that are sold in my old hometown market Oakwood. I also liked the coat hanger at each booth. 

We arrived at approx 8:30PM to the restaurant and was sat immediately due to no wait. By time we ordered it was about 8:55. Then I noticed happy hour started at 9PM. There was a couple things my boyfriend and I wanted to try on the happy hour menu and the hostess was going over some of her favorites as well. She said we just had to wait 5 mins and could order from that menu. So I say okay cool. Then she comes back and says, I am sorry but happy hour is only in the bar, if you would like to order from that menu, you would have to move and sit in the bar area. I looked around, we were comfy in our booth, had our coats hanging, drinks ordered, and our waitress was coming with our food. So no, I didn't want to move, but I feel like it was our first time there, we weren't offered the bar to begin with and after being told we would be able to order from the happy hour menu then told another, I just feel like that was their mistake and they should have granted us a one time to order from that menu.

Good thing is by time we were done eating, we were pretty full and didn't want to stuff ourselves."}
{"text":"I like the decor. We had the Onion Straws (Great),  Hot Link (it was Hot! But good), baby back ribs (Great), for sides I had potato salad (Great) and Mac n Cheese (Good). My wife had the Chicken (Good). The main problem I have eating here is they didn't  have my favor BBQ style sauce (Carolina style vinegar based spice), and my second favorite is a  Texas spicy, they have something close, it's just slightly too sweet for my taste. Overall ok BBQ with standard sides."}
{"text":"Loved the biscuit with honey butter, especially the fact that they just kept on coming. I got the brisket dinner and my friends both ordered the pulled pork sandwich. I liked mine, save for the fact that it was served luke warm. The sides were all pretty run of the mill. My friends both didn't complain about their dishes, but didn't seem too crazy about them either. Service and prices were both average. 

After trying both Lucille's and Famous Daves, I'd go back to Daves if I was hungry for some brand name BBQ."}
{"text":"I ate there tonight after many months of curiosity and all I can say is: When it comes to atmosphere, this place is like the BB King theme park at Disneyworld! But SO WHAT?! It's the most overpriced mediocre BBQ in Arizona. The quality of the food is SUBSTANTIALLY better at a chain like Famous Dave's (which they have all over Maricopa County). Purveyors of great BBQ know that it never comes cheap, but this place isn't even good, let alone great. Let me be more specific: Whether you like your ribs \"dry\" or \"wet\" isn't the issue. The issue is: Is there any meat on them? I've had great pork ribs from little Chinese restaurants with the juicy meat somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 inch high from the bone! The baby back and St. Louis pork ribs at Lucille's were more like 1/8 of an inch of meat or less over the bone...and not the least bit juicy. 

This place is more of a tourist trap than a restaurant. If you ever paid over $100 for a meal for two people and walk away leaving food on your plate because it wasn't tasty enough to take with you, you know how I feel."}
{"text":"The food is always good at Lucille's. The servers at this location are pretty young so they spent a lot of time conversing and not attending to their tables.  I kept having to flag down our waiter when I needed anything.  Don't expect to get a buzz or even taste the alcohol in the 22oz flavored drinks."}
{"text":"To update: after posting my review a year ago I was messaged by the restaurant regarding my review, they gave an apology for the experience and had sent me a comp card to give them a try again. I'll be honest I had no desire to ever return to this restaurant I was still fuming about the incident. I got talked into going here for my birthday dinner so I went on 11/18/17. We made a reservation because it is always busy. We were given Art as a waiter and I will say he was a very good serve and we also spoke with Kyla (sorry if I botch the name) she was very nice too. The food this time was excellent, service was on point, experience was much better than before. If you would've asked me prior to yesterday about this restaurant I'd have nothing nice to say, I'm glad I gave it another try and that they actually valued my review and reached out to me. Most business don't seem to care much about customers anymore so that says a lot to me! Kudos to you guys and thanks for a great experience and some good food. My view has now changed and I wanted to make sure that reflected in my yelp review! 
Last night 12/17/16 i took my employees to this restaurant for our Christmas Dinner. I made the reservation over a month prior. When we arrived we had to stand around and wait for the tables.... but I made a reservation? Yet I'm waiting around like a walk in so I guess reservations don't really matter?!? Then we finally get sorted where they put us was a joke. We had to sit at a table squished against a wall and another large group of people, half my staff were very uncomfortable the other side couldn't move an inch or they'd hit the group behind them. Then the service was slowwwww took forever just to start off with drinks. Now let's get to the food oh my goodness holy lighter fluid taste. Horrible taste light charcoal and lighter fluid, it was dry as a bone hardly any BBQ sauce and the sauce is nothing special.  The two meat combo we ordered that was 23.99 with ribs the bone was huge so you expect meat wow there was two bites of meat on the bone and that's it. The tri tip sandwich taste like I licked a BBQ. I could've gone to Arby's and had better tasting food for a quarter of the cost. I spent $400 on this place and I'm still pissed I feel ripped off like I just got mugged by this restaurant. What a miserable experience for my first time ever here I would NEVER return. At my company we post our experiences at local places well this place will take the leader board for crappiest place to eat. Food is horrible there were 10 of us in the party and we all agreed it taste horrible so it's not just me. Service is slow, very very slow! Over an hour to get food is crazy, 35 mins just to get water flipping insane! Buyer beware overpriced food for poor quality if you want ribs buy loyds ribs at Albertsons and save yourself some money and frustration of $23 on ribs with no meat and leave feeling like you licked the BBQ in your backyard. Shame on you Lucile's!!"}
{"text":"The food was soon good. I got the half chicken with rib tips and sausage. Had a baked potato and Mac and cheese as the sides. The flavors where phenomenal. Also the service was great. I actually had left my credit card there and they held on to it till I was able to come back and get it. Overall great experience with the food and service:)"}
{"text":"Me and my hubby went there for a earlier dinner, the restaurant itself is nice, and clean ( new of course ) But why do you need 50+ server ( maybe even more) on a slow weekday? So, we were literately been watching, maybe stare the whole time,  because 98% of them have nothing to do but stand there and chatting.... super uncomfortable, and the manager was like whatever.  ? think Ill stick to the Henderson's Lucille."}
{"text":"I can't say there's a ton of times that the staff inspires me to a negative review for just being overwhelmingly unprofessional, but this is one of those times. Apparently we were seated near the staff gossip/social area, which was constant and distracting. Then there was the necessity of taking a call, only to have a server walk up and  speak with increased volume... I don't need my clients thinking about my drink order... shut up. I've had mediocre experiance here, and usually regret coming, this time lived down to my expectations."}
{"text":"LOVE Lucille's!! I miss living in Vegas because of it... just kidding. Sort of... 
but, yes, every time I am back in Vegas, I need a trip to Lucille's!! (: YUM!"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm dead right now. I've had food poisoning for the past day and a half and can't even get out of bed from eating here. Be careful or do yourself a favor and never order the catfish and shrimp."}
{"text":"Got the 4 Alarm Burger to perfection. Savory and paired with the sweet potato fries and a hurricane was just delicious! Great service and quick! Excellent!!"}
{"text":"They say they are St. Louis BBQ... but their sauce is not.  It's a California based BBQ joint.  It, however, was surprisingly good!  It is not cheap, but also not really expensive.  Honey butter and biscuits were great!"}
{"text":"A gift card brought us over to Tempe. I ordered the 7 oz Texas brisket with garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob with a caesar salad to start.  Troy ordered the two meat combo with brisket ends and baby back ribs with honey peanut cole slaw and greens. The presentation was beautiful. The brisket and the ribs were perfect. The garlic mashed potatoes were nothing to write home about. The greens were too salty and the cole slaw while pretty was blah.  If we were in the area we'd might stop by again but wouldn't drive the 20 miles out of our way."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour at 9PM Sunday (it was really quiet, which was nice). The waitstaff was very kind and accommodating. We accidentally sat in the regular seating area (BTW, you need to sit at the bar or in the lounge), and they moved us without any issue. We had several of the staff check in on us throughout the visit. 
The food was great. It came quickly and was delicious. I had to take some home and it was still good the next day."}
{"text":"Went on a date here last night and had a mixed experience. I met my date at the bar and we waited for a hot minute before either of the bartenders even looked in our direction. When we finally did catch one of their attention, she asked me if I'd like a drink, but not my date. She was polite, just not incredibly perceptive. 

When we sat down, our server came to the table and gave us a really awkward hello and when I said, \"how's your evening?\", he launched into telling us how \"exhausted\" he was and then tried to correct by saying it was because he was \"so busy taking excellent care of his guests.\" Weird. 

Not to mention the food runner who just dropped the food without saying anything. 

Food was good, not great. We had beef ribs and they weren't as juicy or meaty as I had hoped. Their Sauces are just ok...none of them made me want to keep licking my fingers. The Mac and cheese was tasty, but it's real hard to screw that up and the fried green tomatoes were yummy, but we didn't get enough time to enjoy them because our entree came out only a couple minutes after our appetizer. 

I would like to try Lucille's again but for the baby back ribs and hopefully service will be a little but better."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I haven't been disappointed at all. I love the beef brisket and the beef tri-tip. If you like BBQ this is a good place to give a shot! Mac and cheese is super creamy and if you have room for dessert, you definitely have to try the peach cobbler!"}
{"text":"There is definitely no way to leave this place hungry! They have a very extensive BBQ menu, as well as non-BBQ southern favorites. All of these options come with a lot of food, and all at very reasonable prices. I've been here a few times and have always had great service and have left feeling satisfied. On our most recent trip, our server Lou provided exceptional service and was very friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing place! A little pricy, but it is totally worth it. The staff was fast and super friendly and the food is top notch! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for Fathers Day and thank goodness we did since this place was packed at 3 pm! We were seated immediately and service was pretty good for how busy they were. The food is excellent here! We cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"If I could give them ZERO stars, I would have selected to do so. We ate at Lucille's last week for a late dinner, and everything tasted good, however, my 2 year old ended up with a slight case of food poisoning. She was up the entire night throwing up after we got home from dinner. I had found 2 hairs (after finding the 2nd hair UNDER my food, I came to the conclusion that they were not mine) on my plate and within my burger. I was only a two bites away from finishing my food when I made the realization that the hairs did not belong to me so I was mostly embarrassed that I ate the whole thing, luckily, I did not end up sick like my daughter. It seems that their kitchen may not be managed very well, or maybe it's just that it was 9pm and they didn't care. We had to take to my toddler to urgent care because she threw up well into the next day. So of course, there were co-pay fees and prescriptions we had to pay for. I wrote to Lucille's that very same day that we took her to urgent care which was 12/14 and still have not received any sort of acknowledgement from them. Also, I posted on their Facebook page and the same thing, no response. I guess it's the same upkeep of their kitchen, THEY DON'T CARE!"}
{"text":"This was the best dining experience my husband and I have had in a long time. Our waitress was outstanding!!! The food was greattttttttt! We will be dining here again very soon. Keep up the good work. Excellent customer service"}

{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2016, #6 of 100

When dining at the Red Rock resort it is nice to have so many options that are family friendly. It was our first time dining at this establishment but have had plenty of positive experiences at many other Lucille's restaurants in SoCal. This was not as good when compared to the others. 

I wanted to give a 1 star for the overall experience but went with a 2 star because, Roberto our server was very kind and checked on us a few times but the negative experience has more to do with the wait time. Initially I walked down from my room to scope it out because if you have been to a Lucille's on a Saturday evening you may experience a long wait to be seated. I walked to the reception desk and the place was about half full. The receptionist said they had plenty of seats available. What? I said to myself, that's great for us. Had the family come join me and we were seated immediately. That's when we notice something was wrong. They sat us next to a party of about 25 people in a small table next to the waiter's computer/serving station. Okay, family of 4, small table in an uncomfortable location with plenty of open booths around. Then I thought they saved those for bigger parties but no. They were sitting couples in the oversized booths. I should have spoken up but we were hungry and wanted food. 

Ordered drinks right away, took a few minutes for them to arrive. I like ordering the tall Guinness, it's a good deal plus better on calories, slightly. Then the wait started. It took another good 10 minutes before the rolls showed up, I usually stay away from the rolls but my family likes them. 

It was another 10 minutes before we placed our order. Simple, Lucille's grilled chicken salad for me, wife had the half chicken, kids both wanted the penne pasta from kids menu. I figured wouldn't take that long because majority of their meats are smoked and it should be prepared. Wrong! It took another 25 minutes before our food arrived. What upset me even more was they brought out 3 meals first and took another 5 minutes to bring my son his kids meal. Server said they had to make more pasta. All I am saying here is have some common sense or decency. Bring the kids their food first. My son is 7 but he was a little bothered by it. I understand this is a small life lesson that I could give him but this wasn't the venue for it. Roberto apologized and said they were busy because people were having holiday parties and they had 2 big groups at same time. Okay, that's not my problem but you are making it my problem because of the long wait time. Parties are usually planned out and the party more than likely gave an advanced notice to the restaurant and the management team either thought they could handle it, did not schedule proper staff, or staff members called in sick and left the burden on their peers. 

My family finished their food and left. I remained seated to finish my second beer and to pay. The food was good. It was what one would expect at any Lucille's. The negative was the absurd wait time. There are plenty of restaurants in the resort and a few within walking distance in downtown Summerlin to choose from. Maybe lady luck will be on your side but this particular night I crapped out with the pick. Probably won't dine here again. Good luck and happy eating!"}
{"text":"We went to Lucille's on 6/16/12 for a friend's birthday.  It has a great lively atmosphere.  My friend's uncle was playing live blues for the night!   We had a very large group so I am also posting the review for my meat eating friends also because there weren't many veggie options available besides sides.

My favorite thing here were the biscuits.  They were addictive! The Dixie Sweet Tea was good!  I did not like the Flame Roasted Artichoke app.  It was really dry and had no seasoning.  I expected it to be meatier (like the way artichoke is in a dip).  The Southern Fried Okra and Fried Green Tomatoes were a little too greasy for my taste.  More breading would have set them off!   My friends said the wings were just ok, they needed more sauce on them.  My friend's mom had the Grilled Salmon; she said she enjoyed it.  My friend said his Po Boy Sandwich was \"ok\".  He went to school in New Orleans so he had high expectations. For dessert, I had the Snickers Ice Cream Pie. I was pretty underwhelmed.  It had a somewhat gritty texture, too many peanuts and was soupy.

I wanted to score Lucille's higher but too many \"OKs\" across the board.  No one was excited about their dishes.  And to me BBQ (with creole/cajun influence) is definitely supposed to be exciting! The pluses: Nice servers, the portions are very generous and as I mentioned before, we really enjoyed the biscuits."}
{"text":"Worst bbq ever!  Meat was dry and no flavor without the sauce,  bread dusted in sugar is not a good thing.
Coupled with lackluster management.  I kept thinking the buffet is better than this place.
It is no Salt Lick.
Not worth the price point."}
{"text":"Have been to mamy of these restaurants, some fantastic - some horrendous....this one was on the fantastic side!! Host got us seated quickly, waiter was helpful, attentive and made honest suggestions - even the manager stopped by the table to make sure everything was going fine & brought us extra napkins. Food was delicious and hot....refills were on point and I left full & happy!!"}
{"text":"This opinion may change when I give this place a second chance but for now here is how I feel.....I was really excited to try this place as I've been to their location in Southern California and loved my experience there so I did have high expectations for tonight.

When we first walked in the hostess informed us that \"it's a 20-30 minute wait\". We ask if we can eat at the bar and her reply was \"um yeah but last I checked it was full\" so we give her our name as we preferred a table but found a few seats at the bar. Then, as soon as we sit down at the bar, my mom gets the \"text message\" that our table was ready. This was my first sign that this restaurant hired an idiot for a hostess since that was only 5 minutes not 20. We went along and ended up at a table in the loudest part of the restaurant, that was a second sign that I was not going to enjoy this visit.

Then a random employee not sure what her position was but she took our drink orders and our server appeared right as she brought them to our table. She weirdly confirmed our drinks and then walked away and then finally came back a few minutes later to actually take our order. I found it very odd that when I told her I wanted the \"Smoked Chicken Pasta\" she had to confirm that was a real item on the menu, but then again their menu is large.

So then we waited with our two complimentary biscuits and waited and waited and about 45 minutes later we finally got our food! My mom ordered the Original Pulled Pork Sandwich but for some reason they gave her the Memphis which has cole slaw, but since we were both starving she didn't care and ate it anyway. 

Now, when I read the menu I read the description as \"pepper\" not \"peppers\" so I didn't realize my food came with \"bell peppers\" which I am not a fan of. I tried to eat the dish instead of send it back but every bite became more and more disgusting and I just felt unsatisfied knowing that this dish was going to be $13.49 and I had to wait 45 minutes for it and it didn't even taste good to me since I dislike bell peppers and it was covered in them.

We let the waitress know that I was not a fan and reminded her that we were trying to make a movie that started in 20 minutes and after 15 minutes the manager finally arrived at our table. I spoke with him and he did the usual, \"oh we are sorry but is there anything else I can make for you\" but what upset me the most was when I mentioned how long it took he became defensive and just babbled until I reminded him that we were going to be late for our movie. He finally shut up and comped both our dishes so we ended up just paying for our drinks and I left a decent tip to be nice.

I'll give this place a second chance, but it won't be on a Saturday Night before a movie. At least all I missed were the previews....."}
{"text":"Meh, our boss decided on this joint instead of the other better options available at the RR

BBQ was rather disappointing, I had the St. Louis ribs"}
{"text":"I need to edit my past review unfortunately  Lucille's has gone down hill and it breaks my heart. The shrimp I wrote about is no longer on the menu and guess what... the cook can't make it anymore either. The Louisiana Pasta I mentioned that my husband loves... also gone. Really Lucille's this is nuts. We used to really look forward to date nights here but we won't be back!!!
This place is the bomb! Try the fried shrimp app with the jalapeño tarter... delicious!!! For dinner my husband swears by the Louisiana pasta. I had the baby back ribs and burnt end brisket. OMG it was soooooo good! Not to mention their biscuits and apple butter. Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"I love beef BBQ, brisket is my favorite, so when I visit a new area and try a BBQ Joint and their menu states, \"Succulent\", I expect exactly that! Well, let me state that Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que at Tempe Marketplace is anything BUT \"Succulent\", rather dried out meat that, per the manager on duty, \"Was smoked yesterday\", in other words, they served me \"OLD\" meat!  WHAT?  Yes, old meat. 

In the beginning...
They start off by serving biscuits, and my 1st order was, stated by the bartender was, \"they're old, so they may be hard.\" They were rocks. She asked me, \"would you like fresh biscuits?\"  Hum, let me think about that? YES!  The FRESH biscuits were mostly raw dough. I did notice they sprinkled large sugar granules on the top of the biscuits, not sure why, the sugar didn't help. 

I ordered the BBQ Lunch Platter and opted for the beef rib (1 bone), brisket burnt ends, and tri-tips. The beef rib was OK at best. The tri-tips, going down hill. The brisket? I could have used it for building material. This LUNCH was $16.99! That's $16.99 out of my pocket for ^$#T!@#$%^!!!  

I hope this was an oddity and it's not constantly bad... BUT...  That's your call. I will avoid Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que from now on. 

NOTE: Their employees were cordial, and manager tried to make things \"right\" by substituting foods. He still charged me full price, which I paid without issue, as he did try. Service was fine. The food...not so much."}
{"text":"My S.O. was craving BBQ while we were in the area so we came here. Definitely was nothing special. We didn't eat our main food. The decor was outdated- I get they are going for that look but it was a bland version of outdated if that makes sense? (lol) I had a whiskey lemonade which was good but *extremely* sweet. They brought us biscuits while we waited and they were soo good but again- extremely sweet. I would have preferred them for dessert! My S.O. got pork ribs for an appetizer and he enjoyed it. We split brisket nachos which were \"eh\". I got BBQ shrimp that tasted like straight tomato paste and he got steak which he barely touched. Overall nothing was great - besides the biscuits. Service was decent. I don't see any point in returning.

Pros: okay service, large drink sizes, rib appetizer & biscuits were good

Cons: everything else tasted bad &/or unmemorable, overpriced"}
{"text":"Came here wth some friends to discuss business and watch the Giants beat the Rangers down. We sat at the bar area, which was not bad at all. I ordered their strawberry lemonade, and I love it! They come out in cute mason jars, so dont be alarmed if you think they just washed out a jelly jar for your drink. 

The three individuals I was with ordered the half a rack of ribs, and it was just ridiculously huge (I wonder what the full looks like). I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich. Also, while we were waiting for our food, they brought out biscuits. They were amazing, like fresh out of the oven... and the apple butter is just awesome. 

What I liked about the pulled pork sandwich here was that it wasnt slathered with BBQ sauce... and messy. It actually came out as if some one had freshly pulled the meat. And I got to put as little, or as much, BBQ sauce as I wanted. I didnt have that feeling like I have with other pulled pork sandwiches that I am consuming a sauce sandwich instead. 

For the BBQ lovers, this is def a place to try out."}
{"text":"It's a Chain and usually I am partial to chains but Lucille's definitely does it right.  Been here a couple of times now and as I've eaten more and more BBQ over the years, I can now taste Bad BBQ and compare to Good or Great BBQ.  Lucille's I would definitely rate in the 8 out of 10 range.  

They try to make the experience as authentic as possible with their shack-like decor, apple butter for their bread, jars for this drinks.  The portions are big and the service very friendly....."}
{"text":"The manager promptly responded to my initial review and invited me back for another try. Just had the combo plate with beef ribs, chicken and tri tip- everything was very good (albeit the tri tip was a little overdone). The waiter, Torrey, was very polite and responsive. Much better this time."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhmazing!! My first time here and it was so delish. Their homemade potato chips were so crunchy and flavorful. The haystack onion appetizer was big enough to keep a large party busy until the main course arrives. I will definitely be back here, customer service was top notch as well. Gotta love walking into a BBQ place and being greeted with friendly staff and the carnivorous smell of slow cooking barbecue."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday for lunch with my 3 teenage daughters.  It wasn't busy at all and the service was good.  One down fall of this location is if you sit near the casino you can smell the cigarette smoke from the connecting casino.  We asked to be reseated and it wasn't an issue.  Manager even came through halfway through lunch and checked on the patrons."}
{"text":"I'm always here for lunch and the seafood chicken gumbo... dont forget the coupon if u are a station casino borders member!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service.

My father and I went in for a 2 for 1 special. We were in for a treat. We both exchanged a  bit of witty banter and small talk with the server and the bartender. Super friendly, and great service.

We started with some beer samples. The lucielle ipa was nice, bitter, and sour. The hefeweizen had a nice aroma as well as a sour note at the end of the sip. My favorite, though, was the red ale: lightly sweet at the front and hoppy at the back with a nice mouthfeel. It went great with my meat orders. My dad and I shared a total of 6 meats. The pulled pork was tender, but had just a bit too much bite. The rib tips had a nice flavor and texture. The chicken was juicy and sweet. The baby back ribs were tender and sweet, though I wish it fell off the bone a bit more. The big beef rib was great: soft, crunchy outside, soft inside. The tri-tip was so tender, I didn't even need to cut it. The biscuit and the apple butter was sweet and salty like a caramel. The slaw, while a bit heavy, but cleaned my palate nicely with the beer. The slaw was also sweet, tangy, and light. Not to mention, all of this came out in a timely manner... it was like we looked away, and our food came.

Honestly came in because I needed more protein and fat macros. Left super satisfied. Will eat again."}
{"text":"We love Lucille's!  I always get the triple meat lunch with pulled pork, baby back ribs, and burnt ends.  Always amazing.  Shoestring fries are great and the banana pudding is perfect.  We always look forward to the warm wet towel after eating too."}
{"text":"I love Lucille's, however they've taken my favorite sides off the menu!  I loved the grits, greens and the peanut slaw!  I do hope they find their way back on the menu!  It's just not the same without them.  
Please consider putting them back on the menu.    Rita"}
{"text":"Went here for a co-worker's birthday, accommodated about 20 of us. We had fantastic service, and most of us were there for the first time. The food was plenty and the portions were pretty big, which was perfect for our company. Everything was cooked well, and the huge jars of lemonade and tea were a plus."}
{"text":"Love dining at Lucille's.  Had the tri-tip and pasilla pepper sandwich.  Sandwich could have used a little more meat.  Very tasty tho.  Good service."}
{"text":"Walking in I must admit I had my doubts. It was crowded ...lots of people waiting around. But thankfully...for several reasons, we put our name down and waited for a table. I was very happy there was ample waiting area and the staff was very friendly. I went with my brother we waited less than 10 minutes for our table and this is on a Saturday at a busy dinner time . We were seated and immediately assisted by our waiter who was very attentive & explained the menu with any questions we had. Now if you've read any of my other reviews I am always a stickler for the menu explanations. there were some issues the wedge salad as the menu didn't state that it came with a lot of onions which I am NOT an onion fan but if you are then you will like the wedge salad. However the rest of our meal was delicious. I got the full rack of ribs with a baked potato and corn on the cob and this is just that little half corn on the cob you get the full  corn on the cob. My brother got the brisket which was delicious as well I wished I would have ordered that instead because I love brisket. the other wonderful thing is the food is not smothered in some sauces or even in the barbecue sauce itself.. The service was wonderful the food was delicious served hot and quickly and then we were on our way! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes to eat barbecue it's great for large groups. the only drawback which is why I didn't give it 5 stars is the waiting around is a little awkward in the front of the building where people are milling about and it's difficult to get through at times  people should be directed that they do not have to stand right in front to wait. I always find having to maneuver my way to put my name down for a table is always a pain. and with only one way in and one way out that's interesting during peak times. however we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the service was great we will be back!"}
{"text":"Mike the bartender was great. Brisket nachos were okay. Loved the pull pork queso dip."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of all time. My husband and I come here often. We have had many family events, work outings, along with birthdays spent here. For Christmas TWICE we have received gift cards to come here because everyone knows how much we love it. However, not once has the service been good. The only thing that brings us back constantly is the food. But this was the final straw. Never will the food be worth going in for the terrible service again. We sat for 15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. At least 10 employees walked passed making eye contact. Finally a manager, maybe?, walked by and we glared at him like \"yeah we haven't been helped\" he kept walking, and then turned around almost as if he \"realized\" he made eye contact. He asked if he could get us started on drinks. I said I would start with a water, and my sister said she was going to decide on a cocktail but wanted a menu with drinks. He brought 2 waters, the drink menu, and walked away. Ok. First of all as a manager realizing someone hasn't been helped, you apologize at the very least. He could have brought over food menus, and should have had a talk with a server to get us greeted immediately. Instead, We sat for another 8 minutes when the bartender called out \"you guys are just waiting for happy hour right?\" Ummm, no. She came over and said she was told we were waiting for happy hour. I don't care what she was told, if she was our server she should have greeted us and at least let us know she would be taking care of us. Especially when she was one of the employees who made eye contact!!!! When she came over I ordered my food off the menu that was never brought to me. But lucky for her we go all the time it's practically memorized. Slow service the rest of the night. Tables around us had to stop multiple people for things they needed. I had to ask for bread and butter, which has always just been brought to us. There were at least 4 tables completely trashed from when we walked in until we walked out. And I don't mean glasses, I mean full on plates of entrees. Completely disgusting environment. So disappointed. Never going back again. After 20 times of bad service you have to call it quits eventually. Maybe I'm harsh because I've been in the industry for years. However, I know what my guests expect of me, and I sure as hell know what I expect as a guest. It's a shame when you think to yourself you wish you worked there sometimes, just because you see a million things that could be prevented. Ugh."}
{"text":"Wow, I'd never heard of this place before.  Was in town for a trade show and was staying in Henderson.  Not sure how we found this place, but glad we gave it a try.  When you sit down they bring around biscuits.
I had a salad with tri-tip on it, very tasty.
We ordered a few appetizers and one of them got lost in the shuffle.  Wasn't an issue for us, but even without asking the waitress was nice enough to comp us on both appetizers.  Really nice when they go the extra little bit like that.  
Food was good.  Drinks were good.  I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"This place has great food, a bit pricey but they are worth it.  Will definitely recommend it for others to try."}
{"text":"Had a good morning playing Hold 'Em at Red Rock and noticed they have a Lucille's now. I'm a BBQ fanatic, so a visit on the way out seemed in order.

Staff was awesome...extremely attentive and friendly. Was seated and waited on promptly.

Went with the lunch BBQ platter, which includes three meats. Chose a hot link, beef tri-tip, and baby back ribs.

The sausage was absolutely off the hook...spicy and succulent. One of the best I have ever had.

The tri-tip was excellent as well: perfectly cooked, sliced, and the dipping sauce was delicious.

The baby back ribs were a major disappointment. Overcooked, dry, and stringy. The local pitmaster really needs to be more attentive to this...when a restaurant identifies itself as a BBQ, ribs need to be cooked competently.

Not sure whether I like the sugar dusted biscuits...tasty, but I'm more of a cornbread guy. Mac and cheese side was absolutely solid...not the best I've had, but a solid four stars in any foodies book.

No room for desert this time...will try again in a couple of weeks and focus on all three styles of ribs offered to see if the pitmaster gets his 'Q act together.

===================================================

Second visit. One week later.

Had the three meat combo again, this time with St. Louis ribs, 1/4 chicken and another off-the-hook hot link. The ribs were very good...smoked just right. The chicken was fine, but nothing exceptional. Link was just as good as the first I had.
Baked been side was a bit on the sweet side...a little more kick would have balanced it out perfectly.

Had the banana pudding to top things off...in a word, WONDERFUL.

One weird thing. Sat at a table by the bar...when the A/C kicked in you could feel the floor vibrate. Odd, but I can live with it. Going back in a few days to give the baby backs another chance."}
{"text":"Cody was our waiter and provided excellent service! The food was great as normal...but his customer service added to the great experience"}
{"text":"It's a chain that I have never heard of during my trip to Phoenix. It was very tasty food with large portions, so you definitely leave feeling satisfied with your dollar well spent. The biscuits are amazing and the beer list is decent. I am naturally a huge fan of cajun/creole food with a slight a aversion against large chains- but this place wasn't so bad. Service was excellent, cute family-friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place! We stumbled into this restaurant after a horrible expereince at the T-Bone Steakhouse. The barternders Ashley & Toby were amazing! I'd go back just for the awesome customer service they provided. my husband and i ordered the burnt end
 
We were very undecisive We ordered the brisket burnt ends as an appetizer which came really fast. it was made perfect. dinner was the tri tip salad and bbq sauted shrimp. Ashley was knowledgable of the menu and her recommendations were spot on. I was telling them about the awful experience and service we just received at T bones and they both said they hear that ALL the time !!!!! I couldn't believe it. This restaurant has amazing food and great service period."}

I had the artichoke appetizer, the LARGE order bbq tri-tip with beans & greens - followed by the chocolate cake.

Did I mention the biscuits? They were wonderful!!

Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"After the demise of my go to BBQ place I thought I would try Lucille's out. Well good thing I didn't go when Memphis was still by my house because they would have lost my business. The options are endless, the food is amazing and the appetizers are to die for. Get the basket of chips with Blue cheese. Can't finish them all? No problem, they keep for days! Fried Pickle spears not chips! Great BBQ sauce options. The sweet bread is fantastic and the location is perfect."}
{"text":"I've visited multiple times and each time is about the same. The biscuits are delicious. The service is VERY slow. Last time I was here, it was 3 adults, one child, one infant. We all ordered pulled pork sandwiches, fried pickles, and mac and cheese. Mac and cheese and one sandwich came out about 30 minutes after ordering. The other two didn't come out until about 20 minutes later! Waiter/manager comped one of the sandwiches, which was a nod to customer service. Sandwich is ok. I've had better at Famous Daves or Honey Bears.  I saw a man at a table near us, light up a vape and I didn't think smoking was allowed inside restaurants. Since we had a child and an infant, we asked the waiter to ask the man to put out the vape. He did so without question. Not my top choice or even my second choice for BBQ in the area."}
{"text":"Bad experience...Terrible service, terrible food.

First of all, I was organizing a Happy Hour and Dinner for a retirement party that we had on Friday, August 3rd, 2012.  Reading the fine print on the website it did say that happy hour prices were in the bar area, although because it was a party of 30 we could not fit in that area.  One of the attendees called the restaurant and spoke with the Manager which he confirmed that we were going to have happy hour prices. It turns out when we got to the restaurant they thought we were another party for 40 people that booked the spot for happy hour, but the attendee that spoke with the Manager was misinformed and they only gave us one round of happy hour prices.

Second of all, our server was awful.  There were a couple of servers that actually waited on us because there was a table of 10 people.  Anyways, she took wrong orders and did not listen to our needs and was rushed, rushed, rushed.  Then a new person came in late on our table, and she was not even served when she saw her.  We had to track her down. I am sorry but the amount of restaurants that I have been to, this was the worst service ever.  I mean I had servers that actually new who was new at the table and took their order once they arrived.

I ordered full size of fried green tomatoes, 1/2 order of fried okra, and a plate of sweet potato fries.  The server gave me my fried green tomatoes, but gave me full size of fried okra and the sweet potato fries was horrible.  So I had the server take my sweet potato fries because it was awful.  The server took it away without even asking me if I wanted another batch. I don't cook much, but I probably can fry those tomatoes alot better than the restaurant. I told the server I ordered 1/2 size of fried okra, and she said ok and brought it back to the kitchen then she brought the same dish back and said that she will just charge me for the 1/2 size order.  

And lastly, when the server gave us the bill, it was all separate checks and did not even do that right.  The server was putting stuff on the bill that did not even belong on the check.

So needless to say...I AM NOT COMING BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great BBQ and better service. 

The food is amazing, beyond worth the 45 minute drive we make to visit Lucille's for our favorite BBQ. 

Thomas was an amazing server and we can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant that offers a variety of my scrumptious BBQ favorites! The portions are fair for the price. The sides (e.g., baked beans, corn bread) are delicious. The warm biscuits with sweet apple butter spread is divine. My favorite meal is the baby back ribs. The meat literally falls of the bone. They have many in-house drink creations and specials. I love the design of the restaurant with an entrance from inside or outside of the casino. 

I have to admit though, I know when to patronize this restaurant. If you don't, you might not have the same feelings about the atmosphere or menu as I. It only took a couple visits to figure out that the restaurant cannot handle large groups or an overly busy night without falling apart at the seams. The food quality goes down. The service goes down. The hostesses stop smiling. You become a number. 

I hear some patrons say - \"I pay no mind to service - just the food.\" But, you really do and apparently don't give service credit for your overall experience. When you can't get a refill on your drink, your biscuits are cold and hard, your ribs are cold and chewy, and you go to pay your check at the end - service did matter. Service is intricately woven into everything part of a restaurant - or it becomes just another forgettable restaurant. 

So, I love Lucille's - but, I visit them during non-peak times. 

Last word for my older generation patrons that may want to visit Lucille's. They use your phone number at the hostess stand to text you when your table is being prepared & ready. I know... my grandfather said the same thing - \"What if I don't have a cell with text messaging?\" I think often times, business' forget about our older generation that may or may not be tech or text savvy. So, for those of you for whom this applies... you'll have to stick very close to the hostess station. They do not have a blinking rib notifier."}
{"text":"The food was surprisingly good BBQ.  Large parts so come hungry or take home. 

I got the fried okra & pulled pork potato.  Awesome choice I might add.  Others at my table got the BBQ chicken salad...looked so food.  The biscuits were very heavy and bland... I prob will not eat them again."}
{"text":"A call ahead placement on the list and arriving 40 minutes prior to the estimated seating, and an additional 40 min. Wait. I was told that the text that was just sent to me addressing that my table was ready was given to another individual.  Seated 25 min. later in the service section with service less then complimentary and cold food we disregard by management. Sadly I have been a frequent visitor but don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is good but nor great.  The portions are large, ribs and tri tip are perhaps my top choices - oh and the biscuit and apple butter is tasty but not enough to give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Freakin loved this place. I've been living in Vegas for about three years now, and when I first heard about this place about a year ago I knew I had to go. Anyway, I finally got to go two weeks ago to celebrate my 24th birthday. The ribs are wonderful, and you can choose from three different sauces to put on your ribs: Old Fashioned Barbeque, Memphis Barbeque, and a spicy barbeque sauce. The biscuits were soft, warm, and the cinnamon butter was an added bonus. The service was friendly and attentive. The day I went which was a Saturday, their was a live band playing the blues. In order to be fair, I do highly recommend this estabilishment, but be prepared to have up to a 90 minute wait, and Lucille's does not take reservations."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout as it was packed on a Saturday night! Got the Back porch with Chicken, Tri Tip, and Beef ribs. Also the southern fired catfish  and shrimp. Everything was delicious! However, for the portions, I think it was a but overpriced. Will come back to dine in. Quick takeout service even with a busy house!!"}
{"text":"Places a take out order:

Beef ribs: rubbery. Not fall off he bone. Had a plastic taste from the high heat burning the fat

Burnt ends: mostly fat. Little meat. More fat than I would like. The meat that was there has great flavor. 

Brisket : better than expected  I'd definitely get again. 

Chicken : I'd like a little more smoke flavor it was just ok 

Tri tip. This was the best thing we ordered and for me the only thing I'd order again. 

The sides were ok. 

Not my first choice for Bbq. I would go back for the tri tip"}
{"text":"I love this place. The waiter, Austin, was fantastic. We came here to celebrate my oldest son's birthday and everything was perfect. I travel all over the world, and anywhere where I can eat and a Lucille's is awesome. I give this restaurant my highest recommendation and I would especially say you're pretty darn lucky if you get Austin, as your waiter."}
{"text":"I've dined in both Lucille's locations multiple times in Vegas because I am a fan of their beef ribs, onion straws, and their amazing biscuits with apple butter spread. However, I must say I prefer their Henderson location over the Red Rock Casino location due to their food preparation and customer service management. The staff at the Henderson location seem more attentive and efficient in my experience.

In any restaurant, especially barbecue, I always consider the time of day when dining in to get the freshest batch of succulent bbq ribs when made fresh. This location for me is hit or miss with their beef ribs. I am a \"moo\" rather than an \"oink\" kinda gal :) They are sometimes tender and juicy and other visits some parts of the beef ribs are not so edible friendly. However, both St. Louis and baby back ribs are always tender and flavorful. I prefer the flavor of the St. Louis ribs over the baby back ribs!

What I like about the ribs at Lucille's is that they are not too smokey for my palate compare to other local favorite bbq places around town. They offer lots of southern style sides that are delicious! Lucille's has 3 signature sauces on the tables in which the original sauce is easily my pick! They also have refreshing fruit flavored lemonade garnished with fresh fruits! Some may think prices here are overpriced, but portions are decent and some overwhelmingly huge which makes Lucille's a great place for sharing. This is my family's favorite place for BBQ. And do yourself a favor to call ahead or do an online reservation especially on weekends and holidays. This place can get super busy!"}
{"text":"I like the Baby Backs over the St. Louis. Food is really good. On the expensive side, 3 of us all had ribs, 1 appetizer, 2 alcohol drinks & 1 soft drink. With tip over 160.00."}
{"text":"Nothing not to love about this place!  Great service, atmosphere, and smell haha.
The food was good and you can get anything you can think of when you think classic BBQ.  Be prepared to be intoxicated by the delicious smokey smell as soon as you walk in!"}
{"text":"Came here again tonight, this time just us girls, partay of 2. Only about a 5 min wait (arrived about 5:15 pm) and we didn't like our \"lawn table\" we were sat at so they moved us to a nice booth next to the outside window over looking the water features, kinda cool. You know what's cool also? They didn't bitch or seem irritated (that they let on anyway) that we asked to be moved. 

This time our server was Amanda. She was awesome. Kept our peach teas filled. Had a great demeanor. And never left us hanging. Always smiling. She was great. 

Thumbs up from me and the cousin! :)"}
{"text":"Enjoy this place very much everytime I am here.  Good food and great service.  I usually get a bbq dish when I'm here but I decided to try the cajun bbq chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  I got it with no cheese and it was cooked nicely, probably one of the best chicken sandwich I ate. Oh and the Louisiana Lemonade is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Very good service and food.  Great server who set the tone for the meal.   My brisket sandwich was very good and so was my wife's salad.  Worth a revisit to this nice casino."}
{"text":"We had dinner for the first time here and it was great. I went with the half chicken dinner, side of mac, side of greens and enjoyed the biscuits. I had a Sangria that was tasty with dinner and we all split a slice of caramel salted cheesecake which was spectacular! Service was on point and everyone in our party was happy with our experience."}
{"text":"Great waitress and that was it. Very rude hostess. Food tasted like it came out of a crock pot and was drenched in mediocre sauce. Expected much more for the price. Will not return."}
{"text":"The quality is so much better than when I first tried this place a couple years ago. They have cornbread now...so happy lol! The Mac & Cheese is delicious and the banana pudding is pretty good too. 

Tip: Order rib appetizer for $13.99 instead of half a rack for $23.99 if you don't care about the sides. You literally get about two less bones than half a rack!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place all in all. I have been to this BBQ joint two times and both were consistent. Now don't expect to get a small business feel with a 30 year pit master's flavor/texture/style and over quality at the helm of  the BBQ served, but all this considering, this place does have some charm for a \"chain\" style restaurant. The restaurant itself is cute (large), with a few different seating areas and styles, set up to look as if you were eating at a Southern style home (No not a plantation). I've sat in the bar, as well as in an area that resembled a kitchen of sorts (a little awkward for my taste). Anyhow, the service at the host stand is the one area that is severely lacking and overall sterile, they are mildly friendly as a result of it being their job. But that's the extent. The overall service (server/food runners) both times I have eaten there (once dinner once lunch) was extremely fast ...I mean almost disconcertingly so, but hey I was hungry I guess. The server was nice, and attentive...

My better half and I split their porch platter (I think that is what it was called) it came with three meats and two sides for almost $26. The potions would have been too much for one person (in my opinion), but for two it was large enough (there was no waste or take home), in fact there could have been more fries to be honest, they only gave you a handful and I think for what you get $26 is a bit much. Their pricing is high, a rack of ribs is anywhere from $20.95-25, isn't BBQ typically suppose to be relatively affordable (???) and the reason it is often cooked so long is so the tough less expensive cuts of meat become tender and have good taste??? Maybe I am just a Yankee and don't understand BBQ dynamics... Overall, The baby backs were pretty good, the chicken on the other hand is much better, and the pulled pork was, according to my spouse really good; however, on the air of caution if you are a BBQ master and from one of those states that prides itself on BBQ, maybe you'll have different opinions. I will say they have a large libation menu, and their commentary biscuits with honey butter are very good. But I would say this place is a little (slightly) too costly for the quality, but like I said the charm might suck you in, I'd suggest going with a large group (which I will do if I return to this place), you can make a lot of noise and enjoy the sounds of their live Louisiana style band that plays on Friday nights, Now they were good!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good reviews about this BBQ place. I was not impressed with the food. The service was ok and the atmosphere was good. My first time there I had the Texas brisket. Which came out room temp and very dry!"}
{"text":"Me and my family eat out frequently and most times leave disappointed.... This place really surprised me and you definitely get what you pay for and more! My husband had the ribs and OMG they were perfect! I had a jambalaya pasta dish that was a little spicy how I like it and it was to die for!!! You must eat here not to mention the host are great and very attentive!"}
{"text":"First time in this location, pretty big place, came around lunch time...There were some people, not too busy, waiter was nice. I ordered the Jambalaya which has some kick to it...yummy"}
{"text":"Both locations of Lucille's are pretty good in my book. My favorites that I get every time we are there are the biscuits with apple butter (which they give you refills on) and the peach lemonade served in mason jars. I could drink mason jar after mason jar of that delicious nectar.The desserts are also equally as good. I love the banana pudding with wafers, also served in a mason jar! Other than those staples, I have tried multiple things off the menu, never had anything that wasn't good from BBQ to just plain old chicken tenders. We always bring guests here when they come to visit. Everyone always enjoys the atmosphere and the food. There is something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"While the deep fried pickles were wonderful, a unique variation using kosher dill pickle spears instead of chips, the remainder of our meal was a regrettable failure. Our remarkably poor service, given the fact that our table was almost IN the kitchen, didn't improve with a comment to the manager. Our server was clearly incapable of handling a group of 15 people, and the manager did little to ease her burden. After drinks, over priced because Lucille's doesn't honor happy hour prices in the dining room, it took almost 45 minutes between asking to have our food order taken, and the waitress actually being ready to take our order."}
{"text":"Had the best experience here - absolutely no negatives!

We sat in the lounge/bar area and our server was super sweet and helpful since we had never been. Great recommendations on beer and food. I can't remember my sandwich now because this was a while ago(I live in extreme north Scottsdale) but it had a jalepeño aioli and it was TO DIE FOR. The fried chicken was really good too.

It is comfort food for sure!
Wanting to return to try more things, asap."}
{"text":"Hubby was dying for trying Lucille's and we were nearby... And, though it was Saturday night, it was early enough.... So I said \"why not?\" ... Two words I will forever regret now.

Instant seating, and then the host walked us through the restaurant & out the back door, then through all of the patio seating to a table next to the front door.  Brilliant!  We should have kept walking... (sigh)

Hubby's sweet tea wasn't, so he added sugar... And the biscuits & apple butter were seriously nom.  The 1/2 appetizer platter sounded like a good solution to appetizer confusion, but it was... Boring.  Almost everything was fried & needed salt to have any flavor.  They even managed to make Fried Green Tomatoes boring, which was a big disappointment since I LOVE FGT.  Sad.

Entrees eventually arrived.  Mine was the center cut pork chop, billed as juicy & flavorful - two lies right there.  It was a thick cut hockey puck, totally inedible.  The accompanying vegetables were cold, the garlic mashed potatoes had no flavor anywhere, but the whiskey-apples were tasty.  Hubby had the Back Porch trio, baby back ribs, briscuit & chicken.  All of it was dry but the flavor was good on the chicken & ribs.  His sides were baked beans (tasty) and peanut slaw (tasteless).

Our server, Art, offered to remove my entree from the bill so it came to about $50 for the two of us.

The best part?  Hubby saying he never wants to eat there again, because I totally agree."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Our server's name was Matt and he was exceptional! I got the cheeseburger and I highly recommend it. The BBQ sauce is sooooo good!"}
{"text":"my husband and i had a bad review. we came once before . but kacey didnt even want to serve us, we are both apart of the service industry him being manager and me being a server. while i was so much more patient he wasnt. then she took all of our snacks. her answer was if i thoght you wanted it i would have brought it back."}
{"text":"horrible customer service! i ordered through uber eats and i called lucille's to have a name written down for the recipient of the order. josh answered the phone and he said my request is not possible. duh! i ordered that for somebody to receive it and i wanna put a name on the delivery so lucille's would know who is it for! he put me on hold for 5 mins without telling me why and i called again, after 1 ring josh answered again, so i know he just put me on hold because he doesnt wanna entertain my request! putting a name on the order-- is that so hard to do?!?!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! We visited here 3 times last month! Delicious!

Good food! Good service! Good atmosphere! Great entertainment! Friendly staff! Family friendly!

My kids love the baby back ribs and burgers. Hubby loves the chicken and fried pickles. I love the smoked brisket salad and fried green tomatoes! Their sides are yummy too!

Don't sleep on the dessert! The red velvet cake is on point!

On one visit, we were offered 3 free desserts to take home. THREE! Why? Because our food came out late. Really? We hardly noticed! We didn't complain nor ask. What a way to be proactive with customer service! That alone will have us coming back again and again!

Their live entertainment is slammin' on Saturday nights! Especially if you like New Orleans/southern-style blues and jazz.

Visit Lucille's and have a fun time (and leave full as a tick!)!"}
{"text":"Multiple pieces of rotten lettuce in my salmon salad, lost my appetite from finding rotten lettuce throughout so couldn't even eat the salad or anything else. Ruined my dinner. I know a couple people that love this place for bbq, so maybe they are better with that since that's their specialty. But in my opinion, any restaurant that would serve their guests bad food is a bad restaurant overall."}
{"text":"I could not be a huger fan of this place. Consistently outstanding service and BBQ. We literally had our wedding dinner here. Austin was an awesome server.

Service-Call me old fashioned but I appreciate not being thirsty during my meal. They give good sized drinks (that are not 80%ice) and they actually refill them in a timely manner. Outstanding peach lemonade. 

BBQ- tender meat, variety of sauces, and quality sides. The biscuits and apple butter are out of this world."}
{"text":"Went  to Red Rocks Casino in which this is located and saw a sign for happy hour - we went !Drinks at sharply reduced prices and we ate off the appetizer menu.I recommend their mojito , it's surprisingly good.Their house IPA is also good and very reasonably priced at happy hour.As for food , the rib tips, Pork BBQ sliders were good, the fried green tomato's - not bad.I'd have no hesitation going back."}
{"text":"There's high-fructose corn syrup in EVERYTHING here. Even the vinegar-based sauces have it as their second ingredient. Absolutely ridiculous. 

The beef is not grass-fed, but the pork is pretty darn delicious. Despite the food being laden with artificial ingredients and preservatives, the meat itself when taken alone is pretty darn tasty.

The portions are huge and a pretty good value.

The drinks are delicious and I ignore all the sugar and whatnot in them. It's booze. It isn't supposed to be healthy to begin with.

I order all my meats \"dry\" --meaning no sauce added --and eat them the way they were supposed to be. Meaty and delicious."}
{"text":"I waffled on writing a second review for this particular Lucille's, as I've written one for the other spot in Green Valley before. However, I feel like the experience here was different enough to warrant a location-specific review. 

My other review mentions things like the quality of the meats, the sugar content of the everything, and the ever-presence of high fructose corn syrup. None of this has changed, and the food is still just \"A-OK\", as Yelp calls it. Not special, not outstanding, but also not bad and if you know what you're in for you will get exactly what you expect.

The difference in this review comes down to the building itself, the staff, and the bar.

First, the building seems either much larger or just better laid out. It isn't a great layout, but it *is* better than the one in The District in my opinion. There seems to be just more space, even if that space seems awkwardly placed.

Second, the staff at this particular one seems more friendly, happier to be at work. Maybe it's because they are a new place and none of the employees have become jaded corporate worker drones yet. Who knows?

Third, the bar. They mix the drinks stronger. It's as simple as that. Everything I've ordered at the one in The District has been delicious. Everything I've ordered at this one has been strong, tasted like mildly flavored booze instead of a mixed drink where the alcohol fades into the overall flavor. For some people that may be great, but I don't like the taste of well-quality alcohol and having it in the background of an otherwise delicious drink was a welcoming way to get a good night started."}
{"text":"Having  southern roots, of course I love BBQ. Just not this BBQ. Ugh.
Dry brisket, dry coleslaw, dry biscuits and lardy cornbread."}
{"text":"11/23/16 Thanksgiving dinner

NOT a fan of the thanksgiving dinner this year. The quality of food was not the same as last year. The turkey and ham was very fatty and extremely chewy. The sweet potatoes had sooooo many fibers in them it was like every bite had \"hair\" in it. You would get a mouthful of fibers and chunks having to literally pull them out of your mouth bite by bite. They were not smooth at all. Super gross feeling of eating hair. The stuffing was very spicy. So much that the kids couldn't even eat it. And that is their favorite part! The mashed potatoes had chewy bites of bacon in them or something and even gritty like the potatoes were not properly cleaned. They were chunky and not smooth texture that you expect in mashed potatoes. I am so disappointed. I don't think we will be ordering from here next year. 


Thanksgiving dinner 2015

We pre ordered the Thanksgiving dinner \"holiday family feast with all the fixins\" and picked it up a day prior to Thanksgiving. It came cold and it took only an hour to heat it all up in the oven. It came with 3lbs ham, 3lbs turkey, and all the fixins' for $159. It was packed neatly in a huge box. The food is really good quality, amazing! The ham and turkey is flavored with smoke and comes with extra sauce/gravy to top with. There is so much food, enough to feed 8-10 people. The to go service was excellent. My only complaint is the ham was sweet, there is a sweet potato soufflé, sweet potato pie, house biscuits topped with sugar and a apple butter sweet spread, and with the cranberry sauce it was a lot of sweetness that I would prefer regular butter rolls. Other then that we will definitely order from them again next year. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Last visited 4/27/12...

I have been here several times so I am surprised that I have not written a review yet.

Each time I have been here, the food has been very good.  I have tried a range of BBQ dishes including the Baby Backs, Tri-Tip, Brisket and Pulled Pork.  Each meat has been great.  Many sides to choose from.  Baked Beans, sweat potato mashed, regular and garlic mashed, etc.  The Mac and Cheese is probably not their best dish.  Biscuits are good as is the corn bread.  I also enjoy the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer. 

Service is usually very good and attentive.  This last visit, I was a little disappointed about the ability to keep drinks full. It seems anywhere I have been going lately wait staff has a very hard time paying attention to drinks.  This to me is a huge service error and likely to always cost a restaurant an extra star. 

I have also had desserts there although not this last time, Too Full!!  

It is a great location.  Parking is always available although on weekends you may have to walk from back lot a little as this location shares with Dave and Busters and Cadillac Ranch.

Overall, a very good dinner on Friday night!!"}
{"text":"The service was great! Christopher should train other wait staff on how to be a good server.  Not referring to staff there, just in general.  Our baby back ribs were delicious! The sides were good too. The different BBQ sauces were excellent! Yes it was a tad cool in there, bring a sweater. We would highly recommend Lucille's. Oh yes the biscuits are yummy! Nice touch of Christopher to  bring dessert with a candle on it to celebrate my daughter's birthday!"}
{"text":"Bland, bland, bland-oh wait, sauce is so sweet it drowned out the smoky flavor! They cook the ribs in it and you can't taste anything but the dang corn syrup. The sides are also not good!"}
{"text":"They have by far the best BBQ Beef I have had in a longtime!!! Moist, lean and flavorful....keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I loved the jambalaya but last time I went they put the chicken skin there, I wanted to puke. Other than that everything was great. I would give the place 5 stars but biting into that chicken skin ruined jambalaya for me and I really love jambalaya."}
{"text":"By far the WORST service we ever received in any restaurant. The only reason they are getting 2 stars is that our food was good. We called ahead for a table for 8. I was told 45 min wait. Fine - we show up and waited 15 minutes longer (total 60 min) We were seated next to a large group of kids and a wall. We ordered our drinks, It was so tight the wait staff couldn't even serve water to us. While we were waiting for our beer and appetizers, (We never received the complimentary biscuits) I asked the hostess if we could be moved to another larger table, they seemed very put out and they let me know that it was disruptive to the staff. They had to change servers since the new table was 6 ft away. After moving and waiting 15 (yes fifteen) I asked the server if we could please get our beer, and the lemon we had asked for our water. I also reminded her about the biscuits. I was told they were coming. Another server brought us our appetizer, sat it on the table and walked away. Were we supposed to eat off of the table? So we waited until someone came by, I asked for plates and again asked for our beer and lemon. We were brought out salads, that was messed up too. By that time, we gave up on the biscuits. I excused myself and asked to speak to the manager. I expressed my concerns, he apologized and said he would stop by the table. We finished our dinner, apologized to the server for being apparently so difficult. Before leaving I asked for the biscuits we should've received at the beginning of our meal to go. The manager NEVER came by to say anything to my family. There were so many other instances of poor service, from refills, to us not being offered additional plates for the kids, no warm towels offered at the end of our meal, on and on. Very disappointed in this particular restaurant, but I still reluctantly tipped the server a minimum 15% gratuity. I won't be back. Ever.   I guess since it's LV, they assume we won't be regular guests, but to their dismay my sister lives here near Red Rock and strongly suggested she will never eat there again. Too bad, since we regularly try to support the business's in our neighborhoods."}
{"text":"This location due to the manager response to issues brought up about service in the past, I actually drop the review from a 4 to a 3.  Aside from that they make some of the best baby back ribs in town if you order them dry.  Like other bbq places in town the sauce over powers the natural flavor of the ribs.  The baby back ribs are a little salty but really work well with shoes string & sweet potato fries with garlic mayonnaise. 

Almost all of the food that I have tried at this location was great."}
{"text":"Lucille's has great meets. So far we have tried the pulled pork burger, the beef brisket and the rips. Everything was really tender and delicious, the rips fell right off the bone. The barbecue sauce that came with the ribs was close to perfection. I wish I could have tried all the sides, I picked the corn on the cob and potato salad. The corn was really good, the potato salad could have used some more flavor. The service was super friendly and attentive, we couldn't have asked for more. The gluten free menu clearly stated what's okay to order for me. Next time we might try the bar, it looked very inviting and cozy."}
{"text":"I enjoy everything but the BBQ here.  The Mardi Gras Chicken is my favorite.  LSBBQ gets pretty damn busy during the dinner time and I would not recommend dining in the bar area when the band is playing just to avoid the wait.  It was so loud I could not fast my food."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night and was very disappointed.  The ribs are very pricey and not as good as advertised.  The smoked sausage (bacon/cheddar) had no hint of either ingredient.  The biscuits arrived late into the meal and were cold.  What I thought were baby back ribs turned out to be St. Louis style.  (Partly my fault) A few of the side orders were wrong and it took some time for the waiter to reappear once the main course was served... That being said, once the waiter appeared and we had a chance to explain everything that was wrong with the meal both he and the management were very nice and fast in correcting everything.  Not only did they replace the sausage with another and correct the side order issue, they also provide myself with a set of baby backs on the house.  So, in closing, food not that great and pricey. But the service is absolutley A+."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here on many occasions. I usually get their pulled chicken sandwich which is to die for. My wife and I love the atmosphere and the kids love the multiple flavors of lemonade. My wife usually gets the beef brisket that comes with this amazing sauce. A great overall experience I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for BBQ in Vegas."}
{"text":"We love this place.
The fried chicken is actually some of the best ever and the jalapeno grits are very addictive- I asked for a sample and had to order it as a side (every time we have been back).

The ribs are good - not great.
The bbq chicken is better than good.

The muffins they serve are super addictive also"}
{"text":"My boyfriend got a gift card for this place for Christmas, so we decided to try it. Who says no to free food, right?

We were pleasantly surprised! The portions are pretty big. So, we just ordered a sample platter. It came with ribs, steak, sides, etc. The ribs were falling off the bone, sooo juicy! We loved it. It was very delicious, and we even had enough to take home leftovers... 

My favorite part of our meal, though, were the lemonades. I had the peach - ginger lemonade. it was so refreshing and something other than the typical strawberry lemonade, not that there's anything wrong  with strawberry lemonade, THAT was good too."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service! I was going to ask for wet wipes, well something similar to what they have at bww and before I even asked our waitress brought us warm wet rags! Such great service if you ask me. Smells of heaven in side. 10/10"}
{"text":"Apple butter and biscuits.
Ribs the size of my ass.
Grits that look too hearty to be real.
Fried okra to die for (seriously, it's GOOD).
Fried green tomatoes.
Fried pickles.
Fried, fried, fried.
The chicken isn't too great. SKIP THE CHICKEN. And I prefer the mac and cheese from Voodoo BBQ with like...a pound of butter in it. If you're going to eat unhealthy - do it BIG.
The sweet tea is straight from Louisiana. It tastes like the stuff I'd get in the bayou outside of Central, Louisiana.
Chicken noodle soup that's not just chicken noodle soup, but the KING of chicken noodles.
The infamous fishnet leg lamp.

- 1 star for no gator on the menu.
Blasphemy!"}
{"text":"I went back to this place for my brothers bday.  The place looked empty for a Sunday night.  The staff was excellent this time around.  Food was still over priced and the baby back ribs were tough.  There were some good things that we had like the burnt ends and Fish and Chips.  They gave by brother a little cake and a Birthday Card which I though was cool.  As far a BBQ goes.. It wouldn't be on the top of my list as bbq places to go to.  $260 for 6 people.  $28 for a full rack of tough ribs.  I was temped send them back but didn't want to ruin the dinner for my brother bday."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very nice. The host wasn't the nicest. The food not the best over all wasn't the best experience probably wouldn't dine here again."}
{"text":"I have some vices and BBQ is one of them.  I love it no matter what the style is.  Please read my reviews on the BBQ carefully.  There are different types and everyone has different likes. 
 
I am not sure what this style is here.  On this trip I met my father, sister plus a pint sized niece too.  This is one of the first lunches with my dad since his heart surgery.  (He had the chicken also). My sister and niece ordered a variety of stuff.  
 
I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of coleslaw.  The sandwich was good.  The coleslaw was good.  I would prefer it a bit sweeter though.  We ordered a appetizer too.  I can not remember what it was though.  It was awesome too.  

I you like the BBQ give this place a try.  I do not think you will be disappointed with it."}
{"text":"Service was okay friendly waitress. Food is always delicious. No wait. Also you can take the tasty lemonade home. Not in the mason jars though."}
{"text":"Best service I've had in a long time. Food was amazing and atmosphere was great. Will definitely be dining here again."}
{"text":"We always have a fantastic experience at this fine establishment.  Today we rode our bikes on the new path (we started at Stapley and Brown Road).  City of Mesa - we are so impressed with your new addition to the bike trail; great investment.  Mesa,  you are putting to good use our tax dollars."}
{"text":"We came here a year ago and everything was surprisingly good.  I returned last week, and everything was surprisingly bad!  She had the combo deal with Chicken, Brisket, and Pork Ribs. I had the Smoked Salmon.  The Chicken was awful - soggy skin, and the brisket was a disaster - tough as anything. Ribs were not bad.  My smoked salmon was really not that good at all."}
{"text":"Average. I spent a year in Memphis Tennessee. It ruined me for local barbeque. So far NOTHING, i mean NOTHING, especially Lucille's would even browse my Memphis top 10. It's unfortunate because besides my friends, my bars and the rainstorms it's the only thing I really miss about Memphis. 

The pulled pork is OK. The chicken is ok. The fried ocra is awesome. The portions are huge. So far it's the only place I can get honey butter for the biscuits. 

It's very popular so it's got to be good right? Well so is Taco Bell. Nuff said."}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about Lucille's over the course of the years. Finally, I happened to be in the neighborhood, so I stopped to check it out.

The food was great and the meat was juicy and flavorful. It was an awesome bbq experience. The place itself has a very cozy and homey feel to it. Yoshi, our server, was very nice. Plus, we could see the smokers from where we were sitting, so that was cool. 

However, the food was so sugary, which I know is to be expected from bbq, but I felt like going into a sugar coma or laying down for a nap after our meal. Plus, it was pricey! I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. There are better priced bbq joints elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's an overpriced Chilis. Portions are decent sized, but taste is lackluster. Came with a party of 8. Appetizers were ordered 1/2 hour before the entrees, but came at the same time. Unfortunately, all the entrees came 10 minutes apart from each other, and they \"forgot\" a kids meal. Only redeeming quality were the martini's at $8.50 a pop. Very strong and reasonable for Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good!!!  And good bands on Friday & Satutday!!!   Only thing too much mayonnaise on cole slaw!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best catfish I had in Las Vegas service was good. I would come back here to try the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"We ventured here on a rainy Friday night in search of some delicious BBQ and potent drinks. This restaurants is not inside of Green Valley Ranch, as another reviewer claimed. It is located in The District across from GVR, next to King's Fish House.

The parking was an absolute nightmare. After circling around in the vicinity with three other cars trailing us, we were forced to park in the lot near REI store. The parking lot was a great indication of the wait for a table. When we got into the restaurant the hostess informed us it would be about 30-35 minute way. We decided to wait it. Fighting a spot to wait where you weren't in somebody's way was the tricky part since the bar was also full, and they had a live band performing. Eventually the bar cleared up and we got some drinks. Kentucky tea for me (props to the bartender who took the time to google how to make it) and a Sam Adams for the boyfriend. As we were paying for our drinks our buzzer goes off. Happy days!

We are seated at a little oddball table near the patio entrance. The server brings us some waters and asks if it was our first time there. We nod unanimously. The server is super friendly and energetic and explains the set up, points out the smokers inside of the restaurant and explains the three different sauces offered: Lucille's Memphis (vinegary, more traditional sauce), Lucille's Original (tomato based with molasses/sweet and tangy), Lucille's Hot & Spicy (a little bit of a kick, but I wouldn't call it spicy).

He brought us over a couple of fresh biscuits with the apple cinnamon butter. Yum!

We started off with an appetizer of BBQ Rib Tip - half portion that was plenty! ($8.99) These were succulent and tasty. I would highly recommend.

As an entree I opted for Lucille's BBQ Tri Tip Sandwich ($13.49).. the taste was excellent and the meat was not dry, but it definitely did benefit from extra sauce. Although it is marinated in original sauce, I opted to add Memphis sauce on top of it. It gave it an interesting flavor, and added moisture did not hurt either. As my side I opted for mac and cheese which was pretty standard and not memorable in any way.

Boyfriend opted for the ever so popular Lucille's Original Pulled Pork Sandwich ($10.99) It was great especially with the Memphis style sauce. He had a side of garlic mashed potatoes, which once again, were just a forgettable filler.

I had another Kentucky tea before we called it a night. The server was great without being over bearing. He seemed to appear only when we did actually need something (another drink, water refill, a box to go). Otherwise he didn't pop in ever minute interrupting dinner. Huge props to him.

Lucille's offers great BBQ for Henderson folk. It gets crowded so make a reservation. The sides were not that great, but overall food was delicious and service was flawless. I will be trying it for their happy hour which I am told is from 4pm-6pm and they have some great food specials during that time. Yipee!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service! Friendly staff! I love to take my Real Estate clients here to celebrate buying or selling their home! Nothing like amazing food to kick off a new chapter!"}
{"text":"This is like your picnic BBQ place. It's decent BBQ nothing super special or flavorful. 

The staff was awesome, I felt like I was in the movie \"Robots\" see a need fill a need!!  This was great! I think at least 5 different people were at our table! So yes, service was on point! 

We had the \"Feast For Two\" the sides were good, the mac n cheese was the best part of the meal! Very tasty! The baby back ribs were tasty as well but the chicken and brisket was least desirable. I didn't taste the beans but the hubs said they were \"okay.\" I also ordered some corn bread, it was subpar. The Peach cobbler was alright, not sure I want to waste the calories on that. 

We tried something different, and the food was okay, but the service again was great!"}
{"text":"I had the Jambalaya which was fantastic but my coworker had the Hot Chicken which was not just hot it was overwhelming and not tasty, even for someone like me who appreciates spicy food. The spicy crust was overdone so would not recommend it. Service was ok but would have expected a little higher caliber of service. Be sure to ask if you are not familiar with items on the menu to avoid disappointment. Still an option."}
{"text":"Went last night. We have bben several times and find just about everything pretty darn good. Last two times for me has been Mardi Gras Chicken. Funny, we were joking about the issue that just happenned at Heart Attack Grill in LV (where a guy eating there had a heart attack) and right in the middle of that they set down my plate----which became not so funny when I wondered just how many calorie this giant plate of deep fried chicken breasts and loads of other stuff contained. Anyway, find the food there is almost always very good. Not the best barbeque I have ever had, and to me seems a little pricey (for a rack of ribs) but overall a good choice. 4 stars for the food, and 5 stars for our waiter, a young man named Brian. If I managed that place, I would be doing what I could to keep him around. Will keep going back. A tip for those that didn't know already. Costco sells Lucilles gift cards locally that are $80 for a $100 face value. About the only way you are going to get a discount here."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and service! Their rolls that you get in the beginning and TO DIE FOR. So good. I almost didn't need to order a meal because I was in heaven. Their lemonade a are good but overpriced. The BBQ is good. The sauce wasn't the best I've had. But I still highly recommend a trip here! I recommend the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Alfonso is the best server at this location. He was very on point with serving all his tables. He even gave great suggestions on what to eat. We always ordered the baby back ribs but he suggested the bbq tips which were amazing."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  I've been going here for 5 years now, we usually come here with our large family party of 8. This place used to be so good. Now they over salt everything.  We had to send out ribs back because they were gorged in salt and not edible .  The 2nd rack was still over salted but not quite as bad.. Partially edible, Some pieces of rib were nasty salty and some were tolerable.. But we were so hungry so we forced it down and didn't want to complain again cause it's embarrassing.  I'm worried that it's gonna get saltier and saltier every time. This will probably sadly be the last time we come here.  I used to rave about the quality of this place but it's sadly not the same.  If I was to offer advice id say don't salt the items so much. People can always add more salt to their liking."}
{"text":"Went there for Thanksgiving with my family. Great choice. Thanksgiving dinner was available with a selection of the normal BBQ menu. My wife loves the full Thanksgiving dinner but my son and I don`t so I had the ribs (excellent) and he had a burger which he liked. She of course had the full Thanksgiving dinner which she really liked. Great to have choices on Thanksgiving. Also good that they keep the normal prices on Thanksgiving and don`t stick it to you like a lot of other places.Nice fun decor, and very friendly service.Well done Lucilles!"}
{"text":"AWFUL, waste of good bbq money

ATE:

St. Louis Ribs = 
dry, like beef jerky, some bones had little to no meat on them.

Biscuits and Honey Butter=
dry dry dry biscuit
butter was good and had some cinnamon in it

Grilled Corn =
delicious, best part of the meal (sad)

BBQ Chicken = 
very moist, pretty good, saucy

I came here for tender, meaty, saucy ribs and was sadly disappointed.
Visit this restaurant if you like jerky ribs and dry biscuits."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'm kind of a BBQ snob, having lived in one of the best BBQ capitals (Eastern NC).  With that being said, I heard some good things about the place so decided to check it out.  

I will say, the service is touch and go, whether it's packed or not.  The food, while a bit on the pricey side for what it is, is pretty damn good.  The portions are HUGE.  The BBQ sandwich was about the best I've had west of the Mississippi. It was as close to an Eastern Carolina BBQ as any place has come, which is saying a lot.  They do BBQ right.  My bf ordered chicken and biscuits and was also impressed.  

Overall, pretty good.  The A-ok rating is the prices are a bit steep for the type of food, the service has never been very good and the place could be a bit less \"gimmicky\" and a bit more traditional.  Other than that, worth it for some good old comfort food."}
{"text":"Having lunch with my sisters.. we ordered the two meat combo and tried the gumbo. It was delish! We also ordered the full Lucille's Onion Straws and oh my no matter how many times we ate it still looks full lol but the one thing that kinda was eh was when we ordered the Brisket Nachos and came in to just having nachos with no brisket. I asked our waiter and he asked me \"There were no brisket in there?\" And I had to process in my head what he asked so I said no. So the other waitress who served us that dish said she was going to put the brisket as the side. Since it came later.. the whole nachos didn't look as appetizing coz it looked like the it was there for garnish.

Well anyway, the food is still delish! Come by sometime for lunch!

In the end we were satified with our meal with a warm hand towel wash"}
{"text":"Usually we hit this place up for lunch on the weekdays.  They have great lunch deals on their bbq platter combos plus good size servings. Plus it's not too busy and you're seated right away 9 times out of 10. 

Nights and weekends are a different story.  Mr. B  wanted to celebrate here with the family, so I made a reservation ahead of time just to be on the safe side.  Luckily I did. You know you might have to have a bit of a wait when you walk up and see there are people sitting & milling around outside of the restaurant.  I let the hostess know we had a reservation and was informed it still would be another 15 minute wait. No problem, we just hung out at the bar and chit chatted with our server there who took my drink order.  Ended up that our table was ready to go 5 minutes later.  We were seated in less than a 10 minute wait.  So if you know you'll be dining on  weekends when they are usually busy, make a reservation.  You dont want to be one of the hot and sweaty guests sitting out on the porch.

Ambiance: This place is smokin! Literally! The smoker is right in plain view of the restaurant and you can smell all the bbq meats being smoked throughout the place.   Noise level: Weekdays: average ..busy weekends/evenings THIS PLACE IS SO LOUD THAT YOU HAVE TO SHOUT TO HEAR YOURSELF!  Either that or I'm really deaf.  That's how noisy it was. I didn't really mind, but I felt sorry for our server who had to repeat herself a lot.

Food: Really 3 STARS ... Its good. Out of all the chain bbq places it's the best out of them. My favorite appys & side dishes are their Creamy Cheese Grits &  Peanut Slaw. Fried Pickles and the onion straws sliced real thin and battered in buttermilk are a must to order!  They come in1/2 and full sizes...1/2 is plenty enough to feed two people.  Oh and their sweet tea refreshing. Love the huge mason jars they always come in.

BBQ platters; Mr B ordered the 2 meat platter and I got the 2 meat platter + 1/2 chicken which was six dollars less.  Both platters had the same amount of portions of meat. At least to me (see photos I snapped).   You do have more choices on the 2 meat platter, but if you're going to order pulled pork and rib tips, the 1/2 chicken 2 meat platter is a great value!  The rib tips tender, brisket, chicken, everything had a nice smoky flavor to it.  I like to top my chicken with more of their original bbq sauce.  It's sweet and not too tangy. I usually buy a bottle also to take home. 

Finally dessert: Cake for the birthday guy..a red velvet one. He said it was very good, moist and the icing very sweet and cream cheesy (his words).  I stuck with my usual, warm bread pudding that's drenched in a bourbon sauce . It has bits of peach slices in it. The smaller order is just right for me. 

This place is pretty consistent in service.  Wait staff always friendly,(+1 for all the 49er fan props) our food comes out quick, drinks are always refilled on time,  everything is always good, never had been disappointed with any order..and despite the super busy night, Mr. B's birthday celebration here was a success."}
{"text":"Sweeeet tea just like this Texas gal likes it! Great menu with lots great variety. Our waitress helped me decide between my final 3 choices (all involving brisket) and highly recommend the mac and cheese as a side. We were able to enjoy our patio seat and had some biscuits with BUTTER while waiting for our meal. Only gave 4 stars bc my brisket wasn't as tender as I would've liked but overall everything on my plate was delicious. Great place with fun southern decor! Bar inside was nice as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Henderson! There isn't anything I don't like about the restaurant. I've eaten there a few times and my favorite meal is country fried chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes. I think side dishes at steak houses are usually bland, but even the vegetables here were perfection. The rolls with the Apple butter are to die for! I also like that there is an option to eat outside and in the winter evenings they have heaters on so it's still comfortable. I take all my friends and family to when they come to visit!"}
{"text":"so good.. best bbq I've had in a while.  chocolate cake was also nice way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Ok, so THE BEST BBQ in AZ is actually my buddy Kenny P's.  In restaurant form, the best is Lucille's.  I've had Haps, I've had Honey Bears, I've had Tom's, but the best is Lucille's.  Order the \"cut with a spoon tender\" Tri-Tip, add some of their spicy sauce to the mop sauce it comes with.  The best.

I've torn myself away from the Tri-Tip a couple times.  The pulled pork sandwich was great, the meatloaf was massive and excellent . . . but nothing touches the Tri-Tip

Appetizers . . . I love the deep fried pickle wedges, and the crab cakes with the jalapeno tarter sauce were great too.  

Not the cheapest place to eat, but Lucille's is one place where you truly still get more than you pay for"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place because how can you find good BBQ in the middle of the desert. However the service was great, Roberto was an outstanding server he took the time to explain and answer all our questions and catered to our every needs. The mac and cheese was very good the greens were amazing and the baby back was very good... not fall off the bone but it had very good flavor. We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"We went, as a party of 6, for the first time yesterday. I liked the menu options - lots of choices. The lunch menu was cheap, many options under $10! I got the stuffed baked potato with bbq chicken. I could barely finish the whole thing - SO yummy!! Decent service, our server seemed new, didn't know much about the beer selection or menu. Everyone left impressed with the food though, and we'll return again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I would order everything if I could. The only issue I have with it is the price. It usually costs 80 bucks to feed my family of five here. Beyond that, everything is perfect. The atmosphere is loud and inviting. The service is usually on point. The wait times can be rough in the dinner rush so go early (5:00pm) if you don't like waiting."}
{"text":"Do not go here if you are trying to eat healthy or go Vegan, haha...

Went her for a friend who was celebrating a b-day, made reservations and told them ahead of time that we would be bringing presents inside in a bag and asked them to surprise her with a cake and candle and I was on edge to see if they would follow through.

Ordered sweet tea which comes in these big mason jar glasses, they are HUGE and delicious.   

Ordered Fried green tomatoes, I have always wanted to but my friend Polly said that they would be gross but I didnt want to leave the restaurant without a taste so I ordered them and the sausage trio, I didnt care as much for the sausage but thats just I believe because I am slowly switching around my eating habits--The friend green tomatoes were good but I dont know that I would order them again...

Polly ordered a full rack of ribs and she said they were amazing, Susan ordered Half chicken w/2 meats and she loved that and I had Texas brisket w/garlic potatoes, cheesy grits and that was amazing...

Dessert was banana pudding for me which was good...Not spectacular as advertised but alright, Susan ordered snickers pie which was delicious and Yep they brought out a slice of chocolate cake for Polly with a candle, I was super happy and impressed.

$110 for all that we ate and Yes, we will be back but as I said, not very often, I have lost 19 pounds and want to keep going, somehow I dont see this restaurant as productive in that goal   ;)     Watch me go there next week, haha"}
{"text":"This is the second Lucille's location I've ever been to...  I'm not the biggest fan, but there's worse out there.

First off, I must rave about their strawberry lemonade.  It's served in those great big jars and it's bright pink, sweet and refreshingly delicious in the summertime.  I had two jars...  The pre-dinner biscuit (singular) reminded me a lot of the ones at KFC...probably my least favorite item.  I ordered a combo of baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  The ribs were great (next time I'm ordering a full rack), the brisket and pulled pork were kinda...meh.  But that strawberry lemonade...hot damn, it made it all worthwhile.

So yeah, not the greatest place, but if you're a rib fan, I'd say go for it."}
{"text":"Lucille's is our favorite place for BBQ!

We've come here for lunch,dinner, even Thanksgiving, and have had exceptional service every time. My boyfriend is a big fan of the tri tip, but everything we've ordered is awesome. We always try to make room for dessert, so we can order the Snickers Ice Cream Pie, but it never happens. I think we were able to share the Banana Pudding with Nilla Wafers, very yummy!

Highly recommend it! Eat to your heart's content, then take a walk around the District..."}
{"text":"The original location in town is at The District & for years we drove across town from the west side to enjoy the sweet tea,
warm biscuits with apple butter & ribs. When it opened at Red Rock near us I was thrilled! Unfortunately the quality isn't the same. It's as if the magic touch was lost at the new location.
Last night our tea was so bitter it was sent back, the biscuits were burned & hard & at that point I told myself no more trips to this location. Not sure what's going on but it's not the first time we had issues here. We always voice our concerns but I don't see improvements. 
Looks like we'll occasionally make our way across town because we did always enjoy the other location. I hope they eventually get their act together."}
{"text":"Ate on the patio even though it was chilly out - with the heaters and windscreens it was not bad.  The waitstaff outside were not as hurried and we had terrific service.  I liked the fact that every server would see if you needed attention.  At some places your server is the only one who looks at your table - the others walk right on by.  My baby back ribs were tender and had lots of flavor - rack is about 25 bucks so they should be good, although you do get 2 sides.  The Poor Boy sandwich had really nice fried shrimp, very light coating and not greasy at all.  The basket of bisuits is a great bonus."}
{"text":"Always amazing! I love bring newbies here to try their sugar biscuits with cinnamon butter. The spinach dip is very cheesy. The southern fried chicken sandwich is huge and super yummy. I know what I want when I walk in the door because it's always made perfectly. And don't get me started on the sides. Mashed potatoes and macaroni & cheese are always ordered and made to perfection."}
{"text":"Just when I think Lucille's doesnt get any better....it does! We usually have a large group so we always get the family feast.  This time there were a few of us, so I got to explore the menu a little.  Fried pickles are a staple, and Lucille's does them right! I decided to go with the pulled pork sandwich.  It was everything I expected...and more! Pork was tender and smoked perfectly then served on a grilled potato bun.  I added some of their sauce and bam! All was right in the world.  Until I couldn't finish it of course, because it was huge.  Had mac n cheese as the side and that was also delicious.  Everyone has their preference, but I really like it here.  Definitely prefer over Famous Daves, but in the bay Area there's no Lucille's yet :(  My husband did have a minor gripe, he thought he'd had better tri-tip elsewhere.  But he likes everything else at Lucille's so this was just a small fluke.  Never had dessert here, but I can only imagine...."}
{"text":"I've been here many times; however, this time we had the pleasure of having  David as our waiter and he came in clutch. He was so attentive, polite, energetic and had the best costumer service we've ever experienced at the redrock branch. He made our entire dinning experience amazing! We are only leaving this review so management knows how great he was lol"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. I've come here on multiple occasions, birthdays and anniversaries, and this location has never disappointed. My last visit was during dinner time on a weekday night with my bf and I. We were sat immediately and the server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered a southern lemonade and the sausage trio to start. The lemonade is BOMB and strong af so be careful. We ordered the hot link sandwich and a half rack of ribs, both were equally flavorful and cooked perfectly. I was never a huge BBQ fan growing up but this place has changed me! 100% returning soon."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've tasted in Nevada!  Everything was great, the brisket was tender and moist, the ribs very tasty, tender and fall off the bone. The chicken was tender and juicy, and great appetizers!"}
{"text":"Love this place each and every time I go.  The service is friendly, the food is better, and the sides and biscuits are absolutely amazing.  I am really surprised the average review is so low, try to ignore it and try this place. I promise you won't regret!"}
{"text":"I had an unexplainable need to have bbq, so I headed over to Lucille's to check it out.  First, big points for having cold Shiner Bock on tap - which went perfectly with my slab of St. Louis style ribs.  The best rack of ribs that I had in a while!  Tender, juicy ribs with a hint of carmelization on the outside.  Didn't even need to open a bottle of sauce for dipping!  So much food, I couldn't even finish.  Ordered cheese grits and sweet potato fries as my sides; the fries were seasoned and tasty, didn't need ketchup or ranch for them.  Amiable service - very friendly and attentive, even during a dinner rush!"}
{"text":"I would say that Lucille's is really good, not great. If you're craving barbecue and don't feel like leaving Tempe, then I would recommend going. It's a bit more on the expensive side"}
{"text":"BBQ at Lucille's!  No better place for it. Our server ROCHELLE was awesome. She always makes the best recommendation for a NEW cocktail and encourages me to try something new on the menu. Never been wrong. Such a fun place to go with our group! The little biscuits with the butter...Yum Yum! Thank you Lucilles. We will be back with the whole family next week."}
{"text":"Growing up in Texas, I'm a pretty hard customer to please when it comes to barbecue. Lucille's did not do it for me, but with limited options in Vegas, I wouldn't completely write them off.

Opted for quite a variety of menu options, don't know that I'd highly suggest any of them. Definitely consider starting with an alcoholic beverage, the house margarita was tasty- I forget it's clever name though.

Complimentary BISCUITS upon seating- topped with cinnamon sugar why? Would be so much better unseasoned with regular butter, as others have said.
BRISKET CHILI- large portion, tasty, but brisket isn't as flavorful as I'd like. Adding cheese and sour cream kind of covers up some of the flavor. Cornbread is sweet, which isn't my preference.
PULLED PORK SANDWICH- large and juicy, top bun is disposable as there's nothing on it and the bun is quite large. Not really a sandwich you can easily pick up to eat. Served with fresh-made chips, which were actually quite delicious. 
TRI SALAD- salad topped with tri-tip and grilled veggies, gigantic in size and fresh. Worth a try if you're on a salad or health-centric kick, the meat is a good portion and isn't dry, which still makes it enjoyable for a steak at a bbq joint.
CHICKEN QUESADILLA AND GRILLED ARTICHOKE- had high hopes for this meal made of two half-size entrees, but was underwhelmed. Barbecue chicken in the quesadilla isn't particularly flavorful, despite simply being accompanied by grilled peppers and onions. LIghtly topped with a mostly-decorative design of red pepper sauce and barbecue sauce, this simply had too much going on and the chicken seemed bland, easily overpowered by everything else in the dish. Artichoke was artfully presented but a little difficult to eat, all but diehard artichoke fans need not apply.

Layout is a little odd, with a street entrance and a casino entrance- on a weekend afternoon, signage at the front of the latter instructed us to go through the restaurant to the other side of the bar to the other hostess stand for seating. Having never been there before, it was difficult to find and we basically wandered the dining room until we turned the corner making the stand itself visible. Not such a great plan- maybe have staff on the lookout to escort guests to the right place.

Service was fairly attentive despite a shift change during our meal, bonus points for the classic Ball canning jars used as water glasses. We were seated facing the bar, which has three TV screens above it, someone please change the middle TV from cartoons- bizarre choice of programming as this isn't really a child-friendly place."}
{"text":"Dang the biscuit's are the bomb they should be on the menu for sale but they are free and free lemonade refills yeah everything was hell'a good a must place to visit while in Arizona"}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've had such a great restaurant experience. The place was packed with an overflow outside on a friday night. From the beginning all the staff was upbeat and welcomed us as valued guests. We were never hurried along our meal and our table was comfortable and not crammed in as some places have you when they are packed.The cornbread served first was the best we'd ever tasted.  The baby back ribs were amazing (half rack $26) with 3 choices of bbq sauces on the table as well.  My chosen two sides were much more flavorful than I expected.  Several servers on the \"team\" as well as the manger checked in, but somehow managed to do it in a helpful, friendly way without being obtrusive. Perfectly timed, they gave us warm wet cloths just as we finished up. Then to top it off, brought cake and ice cream on the house because it was our anniversary! Without our asking for it!  I am blown away by the skill, ambiance, and quality and quantity of food.  We will be putting Lucille's on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Great meal, great service and leftovers. Service was fast and attentive. Fresh Biscuits and Honey Butter served while you wait for dinner. I ordered Nashville Chicken Dinner with creamy coleslaw and fries. Chicken was crispy and the perfect amount of spice. Served with Bread and Butter Pickles. We also got the 3 Beef Ribs dinner with baked potato and corn on the cob. Meat came off the ribs easily and sauce was very tasty. The portions on both dinners was giant. Try all the sauces on the table they are all are really good."}
{"text":"Update: the manager replied and that is a good thing. I think Mike got the \"talking to.\" I'd probably go back and give them another try next time I'm in LV, NV Ok, it was a bummer having waiter Mike. The beef ribs were tasty, but not the meatiest or most tender I've had in Vegas.

The side veggies were very good, and the mashed potatoes were pretty good. All drinks come by the gallon..not really but they are big. Big beers - big sodas - big drinks.

Southern hospitality was abundant upon entry and exit. I feel bad for waiter Mike-I hope it was just an off day for him."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying being from the south,  I love fried okra.  I heard Lucille's had it, I tried it, and it is \"OK\" - about as good as Church's Chicken or Cracker Barrel offerings - but nothing to write home about.  I also tried their fried green tomatoes - they were good, but were in some kind of sauce - I prefer just the fried tomatoes - so next time I will ask for no sauce.  I like to eat vegetables so I asked if they have a veggie plate like Cracker Barrel - nope!  I also tried their onion strings - very good.  The meats are all good as well but leave your mouth very dry (MSG perhaps).  The best item is their biscuits.  I would just order biscuits and fried green tomatoes next time I go.  Oh, it is kinda pricey, too."}
{"text":"What a great meal. We had the BBQ and of course it was tender and juicy and fall off the bone good. The Brisket. Oh the Brisket. I touched it with my fork and it fell apart. Best Brisket EVER. Oh then the sides I had were the Amazing Greens. So good. Wow so good. Strawberry Lemonade perfection. The cornbread so good I got two helpings. Yes you get your money's worth and will go home HAPPY singing like Pharrell. LoL."}
{"text":"You would think I would go to Lucille's for BBQ.  But, no, I go for their Fried Chicken.  It is two perfectly cooked boneless breasts in a crisp crust.  But the white gravy that comes with it is incredible.  I could drink a cup of it."}
{"text":"maybe I'm spoiled after living in Tennessee, Kansas City and Texas, but....this place is overpriced and really not that great. Had the chicken and the pork. Meh. Also tried the bread pudding. It was okayish, like the rest of the food - not great, not terrible, but I wouldn't purposely go there ever again.

Also, service was freakishly slow despite the place not being that busy."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the service or quality of food. It seemed to take forever to take our order after submitting drink order.  In addition, the seafood platter ordered did not have any seasoning on the catfish.  Could not enjoy.  One good thing was the cocktail drinks ordered were delicious.   Try the Cherry Spicy Rita and Lucille's Peach drink."}
{"text":"First time visiting & we left planning when to return again! Food was delicious (apple butter biscuits, brisket nachos, ribs, brisket plate) no disappointments in today's visit. Staff was friendly though nothing over the top but the food made this visit amazing!"}
{"text":"We came in at 5:30pm on Wednesday. We saw quite a few people ahead of us. They said there would be a 20 minute wait. 

Looking around we saw quite a few tables empty. 

We decided to just go through the restaurant and eat somewhere else. We saw that half the restaurant was completely empty, and saw many more empty table that were set up, but empty. 

Just read through other reviews and see this is a common problem. They just can't seem to figure out how to run this location!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Lucille's since they've opened at Red Rock. 

There was a 45 minute wait to be seated, which gave me an idea that it's a good place to eat. They had a table ready for us earlier. However, we refused it, so we had to wait the 45 minutes. 

Once we were seated, everything flowed like clockwork.

The ambiance is very nice. The restaurant is well decorated, clean, and holds a lot of people.

The food was very good. I ordered spare ribs, with mashed potatoes, and veggies. My wife had Beef ribs, and was very satisfied. I've had better veggies before, but nobody goes to a BBQ restaurant for the veggies.

The prices were very reasonable. I expected to spend way more than we actually did.

The service is outstanding! Every employee we encountered were all very friendly, and helpful. Our server was on top of refilling our beverages, checking on us, and brought our food out in a very timely manner.

I would definitely go to Lucille's again!"}
{"text":"Great place for families; a lot of selections to choose one, all made from scratch, to include their drinks. Their serving size per plate is good for at least three people. Their staffs are great."}
{"text":"We went to Lucille's for a birthday. The food is absolutely delicious and our server Lindsay M. was phenomenal. We had a large party and Lindsay was very attentive, offered delicious menu suggestions, and never left our table in need. Great food, excellent service. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite BBQ joints to go to. Usually get a platter but the Mardi Gras chicken is also a go to. The fried pickles are good too. Service and food are pretty consistent. Hasn't been perfect every time but you can't expect perfection 100% of the time."}
{"text":"Simply spectacular! Probably the best barbecue my husband and I have ever had and we've had quite a bit of barbecue. The smoked beef brisket was amazing! They smoke it for 24 hours and it has so much flavor that there's no need to add barbecue sauce. The fresh flavored lemonade was also great and the biscuits and apple butter were absolutely divine! The best we've had! Our server Justin was very good. He gave us good recommendations and had a great personality. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour menu.   Delicious bbq.   I think their brisket might be the best in town.    

Good service"}
{"text":"Busy dinner crowd on Tuesday night. Couldn't get through to place a takeout order. Excellent baby-back-rib, perfect coleslaw, delicious corn bread.. If not for the high price, I'd go back every week."}
{"text":"Our family has been here many times, before the food is always delicious and had good service until today. First, I was trying to order a drink for my daughter but then the server said they didn't have it, when clearly it was listed on the menu. Our drinks took forever to arrive, our food took forever to arrive and also our food. We weren't provided with hot towels to clean our hands from the bbq. I hate to give it a low score, because we enjoy the food so much, but the service could've have been better"}
{"text":"Thank you for ruining a great birthday celebration. Ribs were dry - they came out super fast like they have been sitting here. Called twice and spoke with Sylvia about have a cake sent to the table - guess what, they forgot.  Disappointing, save your money and try a place that cares."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful atmosphere, I  suggest you order the chicken, rib tips and brisket. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Tonight's  dinner was not good. In fact, it was terrible. 
I chose a hot turkey open faced sandwich with stuffing and mashed potatoes, and gravy. I asked for the gravy on the side. When they brought it to the table, I could tell it was not going to be great. The gravy was extremely thick, like custard. I put a spoonful on top of my turkey, and it sat there in a lump on top of it. I tried to spread it around on top, and gave up.  The turkey was room temperature, on top of a slice of plain white bread and a large pile of stuffing. It looked like it was all dried out, and I could hardly swallow it. The potatoes had a lot of garlic in them, and that didn't go very well with the stuffing. I asked if I could try a different gravy. They brought a brown gravy, and it had some kind of herb in it. It tasted terrible to me. 
I have a rule that I only order what the restaurant is famous for. I should have ordered BBQ."}
{"text":"I ended up here twice in two weeks. The first time was fine but my food was cold had to send it back.  Tonight we sat in the bar and had to move because the live music was super loud. Too loud to enjoy.  But the service is great and the BBQ sliders were good too.  I recommend the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Been several times. Service depended on the day. Sometimes great, sometimes slow with lack luster services. Food is very good, but some visits better than others. I get their brisket and hot sausage sandwich on a roll which is great and my husband loves their baby back ribs. The banana pudding was a hit last time. More consistency and quality control would make this place great. Wayyyyyyy better than Memphis BBQ for sure."}
{"text":"Second time being here, always great service. Went here today for my fiancée's birthday, as well as my moms. Quick service, friendly host, great food!! Thank you for having a great place to go and enjoy good times, and great food."}
{"text":"What else can I say about this place other than the food is phenomenal and the service is exceptional.  The first time I ate at this chain was in Anaheim and I was so excited to find out they had a  location near my home in Phoenix.  Their Baby Back Ribs are the best I've ever had - fall-off-the-bone smokey, sweet goodness - esp when you slather them with the sweet bbq sauce.  Get the full rack - even if you get it to go - because trust me, you're gonna want more after you have the first 1/2 rack.   The biscuits & cinnamon butter are delish as well.  More like a dessert than a starter - but very tasty.  Potato salad is very good (and I'm picky when it comes to potato salad)as are their drinks - back porch lemonade and watermelon iced tea are some of the drinks we've had here. I can't recall everything my dining partners ate but they enjoyed everything they ordered.  The servers are very attentive and friendly.  Always a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"Went tonight for my husband's birthday. Got there around 5:30pm on a Friday night and got a table right away, out on the heated/enclosed patio. Loved the cozy area and the heaters kept us warm enough. The food was on point! Started with the fried pickle spears that came with a mustard sauce.... So good! Next our dinners - pulled pork sandwiches and southern fried chicken sandwiches. Delicious but my favorite had to be the sweet potato fries. Ask for the garlic mayo to dip them in! We shared dessert between all of us - bread pudding with bourbon sauce and banana pudding. Just the right amount to end our meal. Two other fun things.... the largest mason jar drink cups! My daughter's peach lemonade was so tasty. One of my daughters mentioned to waitress that the meal was so good for her Dad's birthday tonight and when she came back to get the check, she brought a birthday card signed by all of the staff. It was just an awesome experience from start to finish!"}
{"text":"Living in NC, you would wonder why I would be having BBQ in Vegas. But, it was worth the trip off the strip. Ended up getting the pulled pork and chicken combo. I'll warn you, it's a lot if food! The chicken was nice and tender and the pork had good flavor. Maybe a bit in the dry side. Nothing some extra sauce couldn't take care of. Great mac and cheese and the biscuits with apple butter were really good. 

Service was very fast. I think I had my food in 5 minutes! All the staff were very friendly. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 because they do BBQ really well but nothing spectacular. Would I eat there again? Definitely."}
{"text":"I'm going to start for the close of our dinner.. They give you a fresh warm cloth towel instead some bs tiny moist towelette.  This place is amazing.  It's hard to find a good bbq place in the desert but Lucille's proves it has 5 star quality BBQ, atmosphere and southern service.  If you thinking like I was and you're debating to try this place out stop thinking about it. GO! Leave now and you can thank Lucille's for your delicious meal afterwards!"}
{"text":"The last time I went it was abysmal. I even received a note from management to try and make it better. That's ok, I don't really need a freebie to come in again. 

We had a large group and when they told me we would be eating at Lucille's, I wasn't a happy camper. Needless to say, I went back because I wanted to enjoy the company of everyone in my group.

The service was great. Our server was great. Everyone was, actually. The manager helped coordinate from a high chair to a double sided chair to make it easier for our baby, everyone was happy and greeted us, and when we left everyone said bye to us. I felt very welcome to be there, and everyone on staff should be complemented on that.

The food was mediocre, much like last time. The ribs were undercooked; the thickest part was very hard to get the meat off the bone. The brisket was extremely dry. Where is the \"moist\" brisket that so many places offer, I wonder???

Am I a fan now? No, not necessarily, but I will be back for the delicious peach lemonade and the fantastic staff."}
{"text":"I love the big jars they give you for your drinks. The customer service was great. My ribs were pretty good but didn't think they were worth $30. The biscuits (or should I call them rolls?) were mediocre I could've made better at home. Overall nice clean establishment."}
{"text":"Lucille's is a the perfect place for good food, good vibes and ANAZING BBQ. My bartender Kelly was extremely helpful and great to talk to. He helped me navigate through the menu. They even have live blues on Saturday!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place. While their mac & cheese is great, nothing else on the menu has stood out to me. Service is timely and very friendly and overall the experience is always pleasant when I am at Lucille's. Although, I can say that my husband adores this place. So I think some people love it and some people don't. 

I would say that it's a great place for families and kids! 

I had the Crocodile Cooler cocktail and while it had good flavor it wasn't very strong which after one drink I would LIKE to feel SOMETHING. Especially from a drink that large."}
{"text":"Best ribs I have ever had. They seem to make them \"mid-western\" style which reminds me of living back in Illinois. Great atmosphere, and wonderful Ice-tea flavored with Strawberry, watermelon, etc."}
{"text":"The food is great. The waiters are hit-or-miss. The hostesses are incompetent.  Good luck with them getting your name and phone number right on the waitlist.  Expect a text right away confirming they have the right number.  No text means they input your number wrong or not at all."}
{"text":"One of the best culinary experiences I have experience in some time!!  The fab service started from calling the hostess to the end when we were sincerely asked to have a good night when leaving.  Matt was superb with his engagement and recommendations!!  He truly enjoys his job!!  With this type of service and food quality I will eat here any chance I get!!"}
{"text":"I had some cravings for fried chicken and my other half suggested this place.

The setting looked really nice red brick walls and a southern country feeling on the exterior and interior, the music was pretty amusing too because it was live, I felt like I was somewhere between Louisiana and Texas.

The hostess was really friendly and she quickly seated us. The waiter was very friendly too great customer service. I ordered the southern fried chicken and it pains me that it was made out of breast meat and no bone! I would've gone to KFC for my cravings. This place was alright but the fried chicken could've been better."}
{"text":"We Love it here food is always good!
Fried Pickles and fried onion a must try....
I always order baby back ribs, never disappoints"}
{"text":"Service was great. Very attentive staff. Timing of food arrival was a little off. It took longer than expected to receive our appetizer, but then our entrées seemed to come out too soon after the appetizer. 

Overall good food. Loved the okra. I'm probably more likely to return for happy hour, when I'm able to try a bigger variety without worrying about leftovers."}
{"text":"Placed a to go order for tri tip and spicy smoked sausage. They said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I showed up after 20 minutes and the hostess acted as if she had no idea how to ring me up or ring up what I ordered. That part wasn't the problem but training your staff properly is always a good idea. My food was cold and the portions was extremely small for the $32 that I was charged. I live 2 minutes away from Red Rock casino and will drive to Famous Dave's next time."}
{"text":"Yummy place for bbq. I prefer the baby back ribs and also the fried chicken (with the gravy on the side so the chicken doesn't get soggy).

They have some pretty decent Family Meals with good prices. When we go with the entire family thats the way we order. Saves us money and everyone gets well fed with leftovers to boot.

The place is always packed, so either get there early or expect to wait."}
{"text":"This as close to my mother's bbq as it gets and in some respects better (don't tell her I said that)
Not too many places serve burnt ends but Lucille's adds burnt ends to a salad to make even the toughest carnivore beg for more!"}
{"text":"Been here 4 or 5 times and have been very happy each time, with some exceptions on my latest visit (1-25-14).

I usually get BBQ chicken or Baby Back Ribs and they have always been great. I tried the fried chicken once, it was \"OK\".. the \"fried\" part just fell off when I cut in to it. No biggie though!

The service up until 1-25-14 had been outstanding and have no complaints about any of my prior visits. This past Saturday, my friend and I arrived around 6:30 and the place was packed like a sardine can. Upon asking for a table, we were told it would be about an hour (good for them for being so busy!). They suggested we could scout out the bar for tables and we did. We found two spots at the bar immediately and sat down.

We sat there for a few minutes at which time I took the buzzer thingamajig back to the hostess and let them know we found a place in the bar. I came back and my friend said the bartender came by and told her he would be right with us. After no less than another 10 minutes, watching that bartender and the other bartenders attend to guests seated at the bar as well as every Tom, Dick and Harry that came up to the bar for a drink except us, we had to flag one of them down just to get our order taken. 

We provided the female bartender with our order and figured we would have a bit of a wait for food as busy as the restaurant was, so we watched TV and talked. The band started playing and while it was cool to have music, it was so loud, I couldn't even hear myself talking to my friend. I know I am starting to sound like a whiner, but seriously, it was loud!

Our salads arrived about 12-15 minutes after we placed our order and that was OK, but then our dinners came out within 2 minutes of that, surprising but now I have 90% of my salad and a full rack of ribs in a confined spot at the bar with all of us elbow to elbow. Difficult to maneuver everything without jabbing the guy next to me. The ribs were not as tasty as I have had before, really missing a lot of the BBQ flavor and I also noticed they didn't have as much meat on them as there has been on previous visits. Disappointing for the cost (I believe they were $26). They were still OK, just not good enough to get excited about.

Overall, I really like this place and I'm sure I'll return. I won't let this last experience ruin what had been very good everything up until then. I still recommend Lucille's if you are looking for good food and great service, but they'll have an off night from time to time like any other restaurant in the world.

UPDATE: not more than a few hours after posting the review above, I was emailed by someone I assume is from Lucille's corporate office apologizing for my most recent experience and thanking me for my feedback. No restaurant will ever be perfect every time, but how they handle customer complaints goes a very long way with me. His email to me sealed the deal and I will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a long lunch or dinner.  It was a 20 minute wait, and there were more than a dozen tables available.  Frustrating start, but it got better!  The biscuits, as everyone is mentioning, are fantastic.  

Watch out ordering the BBQ here, as it's extremely heavy on the mustard.  If you're looking for something more traditional, this isn't the place.  The side dishes we got (shoestring fries and Mac & Cheese) were completely devoid of flavor.

Here's where it lost a couple stars: I would have ordered something different, if anyone from the restaurant would have checked on our table, at any point during the meal.  Big miss on the service.... and the food."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to a restaurant  that wowed  me in every way. So when one does I have to give kudos. Lsb  is amazing . Excellent  service, food is phenomenal. I was born in the real South  not this horrible  South West.  Alot of places here try and emulate southern  cooking but none even come close, Lucille's hit the nail right on the head.  I generally  don't care for restaurants with junk all over the walls but there decor had a down home country  charm wasn't over the top like Cracker Barrel,  who makes you feel  like your  In a bad episode of little house on the Prairie. 10 stars can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Updating review 11/24- received an immediate response from the manager apologizing for the poor experience and was offered a complimentary gift card for my next visit. Appreciated the timeliness of them taking action and won't let this negative experience at the Vegas location outweigh my positive experience at the Culver City location especially after management made an effort to make me feel like a valued guest and welcoming of my feedback.


Got super excited when I saw there was a Lucille's in Vegas after visiting the one in Culver City, CA (went twice in three days it was soooo good). We don't have Lucille's in Seattle so I couldn't wait to eat here.

I ordered through Uber Eats and has my food delivered-- arrived within 45 minutes which was great. However, my order was beyond incorrect. And highly disappointing for $45. I ordered the smothered chicken which says it comes with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables-- I ended up with coleslaw and cold French fries. Now if that wasn't bad enough... there was NO gravy for the chicken. So my chicken was \"smotherless\". Lucky there was a bbq sauce in the bag to go along with the bbq chicken sandwich I ordered my friend. 

All in all, not a good experience and I don't know if I'd come here agai"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food is exceptional. I came here on 10/14/14 and got the Quarter pound chicken lunch special with brisket burnt ends. My boyfriend got the regular brisket plate with macaroni and fries. We also got half order of friend pickles as an appetizer (best ones yet)

The chicken was amazing, nice smokey flavor and juicy! Brisket burnt ends were good no complaints here. My boyfriends brisket were good but the macaroni was average nothing too special; fries were the worst, it was skinny like straw fries and super stale! I thought I had picked up a bad one but they were like fries that had been left out for too long. 

This place is also a little pricey but you pay for what you get. Our total bill came out to 40$. I would probably choose this place over Famous Dave's the BBQ restaurant chain.  

BTW, the free biscuits are to die for with cinnamon sugar butter!"}
{"text":"It's graduation season and we were starving after a long ceremony. I was smart enough to call ahead and ask about the wait and figured by the time we get there our table would be ready. Sure enough it was. They also took down my number and sent me cute little texts telling me my table was being prepared or ready. That's something that probably comes in handy for those who are around shopping in the district. 

All I wanted were ribs!!! I optd for a salad because I'm trying to be a good girl. The service staff was good, just good and slow. Everything seemed to be taking for-ev-ver! It gill could just be because we wanted gourmet food at microwave speed, but at the end of the night, a cup of tea took just as long. Which brings me to the fact that the air was on full blast and completely unbearable. I'm use to being s little colder indoors, but I had goosebumps and chills. I thought the warm towel at the end of our meal was a means to bring up my body temperature. 

I had the salmon salad and it was grilled perfectly. I didn't read the ingredients too well because nasty tomatoes and cucumbers made their debut onto my plate. The capers were extremely salty too. I basically ate salmon, greens and onions. I left all that extra stuff in the plate. 

Ok, so I wasn't as good of a girl as I could've been, but I swear I only had 3 baby back ribs! Lol. Can't come here without eating bbq! No complaints there!

The guest of honor ordered a steak medium and not only did he receive his plate well after everyone else, it was also well done. So the fired up another steak and we waited in the Arctic Circle longer, but they comped the steak so all is well with that.  I'll definitely remember to bring a sweater or just demand to be sat outside next time."}
{"text":"Came down here for a Mother's Day dinner. 
Service was great and as well as the food. 
Be warned through don't leave anything behind ; wallet, watch, glasses because you certainly will not be seeing them again. I literally walked back in after having stepped out of the restaurant, the person who cleaned my table definitely had to have seen my Rayban sunglasses but they said they didn't find I thing. Shady workers, it's a shame considering I really loved coming down to this place but never again."}
{"text":"The most fantastically average barbecue in the Valley is at Lucille's.

It started out promising: they brew their own beer! Yes please! But like everything else we ordered that night, flavor was lacking. Like a similar chain restaurant that rhymes with \"Blame Bumper\", there's plenty of everything, but nothing you'd describe as \"delicious\". Nothing you remember, nothing you crave.

The high notes were the deep-fried pickles, the hot and spicy sauce and the banana pudding. As many, many others pointed out, the meat was dry.

I really hate writing this sentence, because our server was an absolute sweetheart -- but if you take a customer's drink away to refill it, it needs to come back to the customer within a minute. My server forgot my refill and I was left without anything to drink while my mouth was on fire from the hot and spicy sauce. I know it's all \"teamwork service\", but I couldn't find anyone to help me with this during my entire main course.

Here is how Lucille's can improve:

1. More servers. If you spend money on just one thing, make it more servers. They were stretched thin.

2. Better ingredients. If you're going to invest in an enormous indoor smoker (and yes, folks, they use real wood, I watched them stoke it) then invest in some quality meat.

3. Smaller portions of better food wouldn't disappoint me. There are only one or two places with really outstanding barbecue in the Phoenix area, plenty of room to compete on quality."}
{"text":"First the food and the wait staff were very good!
But for the second time - the hostess and seating system  for this Lucille's is the worst.  It doesn't help that the waiting area is exceptionally small but the way the hostess group handles the waiting guests is a joke.  We felt like we being hurdled like cattle in a small area with no communication with the guests from the staff. We had a Reservation and still had to  wait 20 minutes for our table.  NO communication about when we were to be seated.  Not only our party but many other guests were saying the same thing.  This has happened to us twice at this Lucilles - and as a result this will be our last visit."}
{"text":"Service was fast, food was great, and the atmosphere was nice. Me and my Girlfriend surely enjoyed our first time here. 

I recommend trying the Hot n' Spicy BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"This is the best barbecue I've ever tasted. I've spent a lot of time in South Carolina with really good barbecue but this place won the title in one dinner.

The brisket was the best I've ever had, my friend got the tri-tip and gave me some and I think that tri-tip was the best meat I've ever had. You could see the smoke ring on the meat and in each bite you could take the smokey hickory. Sides were good, nothing crazy but the meat was amazing.

Last thing, the waiter was very good. Service seemed really good overall and maybe we just lucked out with our waiter but he was a really attentive guy. This place is a little pricey but worth it for that authentic, smoked barbecue."}
{"text":"This is a more sit down full service restaurant not a casual dive bbq place.  Prices are much higher because of that. 

I had the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese.  Food was good.  Mac and cheese was excellent.  

Soda said it was $3.30!   I think most places are high at $2.50 but this was insane.   

I would come here for a nice occasion but would stick to the smaller hole in the wall places for normal meals."}
{"text":"Best BBQ restaurant ever. We love this place. They have it all, and it is all very good.  The bread is delicious and I highly recommend the brisket. The portions are more than you can eat, and the service is spot on even when it is busy. We've been just 3 of us and goes with as many as 15 and they always come through. My favorite place to eat in the valley and I live in the far west part of the valley."}
{"text":"One word review: Meh.

Three word review: Meh, at best.


I was pretty excited to try this place- obviously I had my initial \"BBQ in Vegas?\" skepticism, but then it seemed to get a lot of positive reviews on yelp. I live close to the Red Rock so having a good BBQ joint in the neighborhood would of been pretty awesome. 

We arrived around 6pm and the place was pretty empty- not a good sign since the Red Rock itself was pretty packed. Despite being nearly empty it still took about 10 minutes to get a table as the 3 staff working the door discussed the conundrum of where to sit us over their headsets with the mothership. It was another 10 minutes before someone took our order. 

Wanting to try a bunch of stuff we decided to get the App sampler which includes sweet potato fries, fried pickles, rib tips, okra, chicken tender, some sort of southern egg roll, sausage link, and some other unidentifiable food stuffs. It was all about the quality you would expect from making the same items at home in 1 oven at the same time by just guessing at what temperature would best suit all items. Sweet potato fries were mushy, fried pickles were tough, rib tips had bones in them and were tough, sausage was cold. Overall very dissapointing.

I also ordered the Brisket chili which was on the special menu- figuring after the app platter I wouldn't be able to tackle a whole rack of ribs, perhaps an error I admit. The chili was just very bland and only lukewarm. The cornbread that came with it was very dry. 

Throughout the meal service was slow, and despite the jars they bring the water in being enormous I was frequently without a drink which is a pet peeve. for 24 dollars a person it was on the expensive side for BBQ, with low quality."}
{"text":"there are some good BBQ spots in LV but i always choose Lucille's over the other ones just because of their biscuits. I don't know if they changed the recipe or what has happened, but the past 3-4 times i've ordered delivery from Lucille's, the biscuits have been terrible (i usually get an order of 6). They have been stale, hard, and dry every time. I can't even cut the biscuit in half without it crumbling into my hands. I am a die hard fan of these biscuits, and they have just been such a disappointment the last few times i've ordered them. I highly doubt these are being served to the customers who are dining in.. please, Lucille's, stop giving your old, dry, hard biscuits to those ordering delivery from you!!"}
{"text":"This is a tough review. The food is amazing. From appetizer on down. It is very pricey so be prepared to spend a pretty penny. But the service was HORRIBLE.... I think we might have had the worst waiter of all time. Took forever to get our drinks. Took forever to get our appetizer and took forever to get our food. Showed up at 8 and did not get our main dish untill 935. Really disappointed in the service.  I recommend everyone to try it out, but the service needs a major upgrade."}
{"text":"Wow. Don't order take out and hope for a decent experience. The staff at the take out window is clearly over-worked or just cranky. An on-line order for a particular pick up time became  an issue according to Kelsey because, \"We are really busy right now.\"  Don't take on-line orders with pick up times or staff your establishment accordingly.  First time I've been bummed out so I hope it was an anomaly."}
{"text":"I have been here and the GVR location several times. I have tried many items on the menu but I really stick to what stands out in Vegas. The beef ribs.
 There are only 2  place I have found in Vegas that always has beef ribs and this is one of them.  

Here is the thing, the ribs are smoked well and very tasty but you could put that sweet sauce on tree bark and I would go for it. These ribs are the definition of beef back shiners. 3 for $24 seems like a jack move to me, but I always pay it for these tasty treats. There are better cuts for cheaper in Las Vegas but the sweet sauce on these pull me in everytime. 

If the price was reduced to match the amount of actual meat you can get off a rib bone or if you could get one rib on a combo plate then I would raise how many stars i gave. Catch 22."}
{"text":"I have been here on a number of occasions.  I love the rib tip appetizer and it fills me up for only $9.  I love their BBQ sauce more than anything and you can purchase it whihc is a HUGE BONUS.  I am not a fan of their ribs because they're a bit tougher than my taste but the BBQ sauce is so good I use it on food from other venues.  I like the fried okra as well as the Raspberry lemonade is sooo good. The mac and cheese is good too as well as a few other appetizers.  I more so come here for happy hour and the appetizers offered during happy hour.  They have great drinks (liquor) and I always sit at the bar and I am always treated with great customer service.  Overall I love this place and they always strive their best to make sure the customer is happy even when they have a slip up."}
{"text":"Thanks Brad for rectifying  issue with to go order.  Was greeted by Abel at to go counter right away & Manager was quick to respond to accept gift card.  all in all much better experience this time around Please keep it up."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing every time!  I have been here many times and have never been disappointed. If you are looking for good authentic BBQ this is the place to go. I love their BBQ sauce, especially the hot and spicy!  

The service is always on point here and they all have a great attitude. 

I love this place. I always get the country fried chicken sandwich. The rib appetizer is also a must try!"}
{"text":"I went to Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que last week, loved the atmosphere, service was different, it was good but different (we must of had 3 different people assigned to our table of two).  I had Brisket and it had a perfect smoke ring around the upper layer, tender and I must admit it was almost as good as what I make.  I had a Margarita that was good as they come. Laura and I shared a Red Velvet cake - heavenly.  The reason I gave a 4 star would have to be the fried onion rings - when the manager walks by a table and asked \"How is everything\" you would think He or She would notice the full basket of fried onion rings, almost untouched!  I I said Greasy, that would not begin to cover them.  I thought the Manager or one of our servers would have asked  \"Was there something wrong with your fried onion rings\", but NO.  I will go back and will recommend to anyone to try them out But stay away from the fried and overly Greasy onion rings."}
{"text":"It was just okay.  I think this was the first time one of our locals had been here where the service for a large party was less than exceptional.  I think they were just a little unprepared for a group of 16 that evening.  

The Texas-style BBQ briskly was good, but a little dry.  The brisket DID have the perfect smoke ring!  The spicy BBQ sauce was my favorite from the three available, but a little too sweet. The veggies that I chose for my side were overcooked.  

I had the Lucille's Amber Ale, and it was very tasty.  I thought that the drink menu was impressive."}
{"text":"Cool vibe and atmosphere.  Really like that they have live bands.  The best bbq I've had in Vegas/Henderson area."}
{"text":"Most favorite BBQ ever! Start out with complimentary biscuit and their awesome apple butter. The portions here are huge, so my gf and I always share the full rack baby back ribs and 2 sides (usually the sweet potato fries and garlic mash potatoes).  The full rack of ribs cost $3 or $4 more than the half rack of ribs, so go big! Don't know what it is, but the ribs here are much better than Memphis BBQ or Famous Dave's. The portions here are big, but if you have more than 4 people in yr party, go for the backyard family feast! Comes with 2 racks of ribs,2 half bbq chicken and 4 sides, 4 of my guy friends and I cant finish that! My mom ordered the feast one year for Thanksgiving, instead of cooking and we loved it!

There are 3 bbq sauces on the table, by far the best is the hot & spicy bbq sauce. The other ones are Memphis bbq and lucilles original bbq sauce. 

The sweet potato fries are perfect,  sweet and salty and the right texture and chewiness. The other sides are typical of other restaurants, nothing else really stands out.   

Service is always great and its located in The District, gives you a chance to window shop and walk off some the calories you just just ate"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I don't go to often, so when I do, it's always exciting. The smoky aroma that you smell as you walk up to the place gets my mouth watering lol. They start you off with these fresh biscuits that come with whipped apple butter. For the appetizers, you should definitely try the fried green tomatoes. My boyfriend's favorite is the Mardi Gras chicken. It is easily one of the best dishes on their menu. I mean, look at that picture I posted. Serious shit, my friends(I mean that in the best way possible). I love the blackened catfish. It comes perfectly cooked, smoked, and seasoned. It is one of my favorites. This place never lets me down. If you are ever in the red rock casino don't hesitate to stop by this place. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG! I absolutely love this place. Shout out to the server Blake because he is great! He has  a great attitude even in peak business times.

LETS TALK FOOD
In my multiple visits to Lucilles, I've had
-Beef brisket: Tender. Juicy. Flavorfull.
-Mac and cheese: creamy and delicious.
-Fried chicken: to die for. So crunchy and flavorful!
-Garlic mashed potatoes: creamy and delicious
-Original lemonade: just the right amount of tartness and sweetness
-Sweet tea: It is sweet the way it is supposed to be! I also like how they garnish with mint leaves.

The only thing I didn't like, I apologize to those who like them, was their biscuits and corn bread. The biscuits were stale and the corn bread is too spongy and dense. I am not a fan of those textures."}
{"text":"All the food was dry, rubbery and overly salty.  Worst ribs, sausage and sauces I have ever had.

Terrible Mac n cheese, biscuits and other sides.

Service is oblivious until flagged down.

The whole table ate less than a 1/4 of the meal and felt sick and bloated.  Gross!"}
{"text":"I went a little different today...  Got the Fat Tuesday Chicken and Potatoes.  Freaking amazing!  Wife got the Catfish, a winner as well.  
Point if the review is every damn time I visit I make the drive here.  So good.  Everything is so damn good!!!  (Fatboy tears!). 
Also try the Gator Cooler Cocktail.  Kinda like a Zombie.  Strong but you can't taste the alcohol!  :)"}
{"text":"I really don't like BBQ but the boyfriend does so every once in awhile I had to please him.  So I have to rate this place mostly according to him.  I had the catfish fingers.  Which were great, but kind of hard to mess up.  He had brisket and liked it quite a bit.  They had lots of BBQ sauce options, but he said there wasn't one that wowed him.  Not a bad BBQ place."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like Lucille's, really, we did. I married a Southern boy, so as I was reading the online menu to him, he decided he really wanted to go. Unfortunately for Lucille's, we've already been to Bobby Q's and Lucille's just does not stack up.

DRINKS: Hubby had an interesting dark beer made by Albita Ale in Louisiana (although our server mistakenly said it was from Mississippi) called Turbo Dog which had some rich coffee tones. I am not usually a dark beer drinker, but I liked it too. I had the sweet tea which was served in a big mason jar with a sprig of fresh mint. It was sweet, but not LoLo's sweet (God love ya' LoLo's, but you're not exactly helping prevent the diabetes!) and that's a good thing. 

APPETIZERS: Hubby just had to have him some fried okra. I tried two pieces to be a good sport, but the interior texture is something I just can't get over. He thought it was delicious and preferred the mustard dipping sauce over the spicy ranch. We were also served some biscuits (which we both felt were also made with some corn meal and this made them a little tougher) and some \"apple butter\" which was not really apple butter, but rather some sweetened butter tinged with cinnamon. Not impressive.

MEAT: Hubby had the brisket and I had the tri-tip. The brisket is so far superior at Bobby Q's in terms of tenderness. Lucille's wasn't awful, though, and the \"mop sauce\" which is different from the three sauces that were in bottles on the table (original, Memphis, and Hot & Spicy) was really good, and I usually don't like BBQ sauces. My tri-tip was very smoky in flavor, but rather dry. I asked for it dry (meaning no sauce) and was even challenged to do so by the menu itself which claimed that the true test of good BBQ was having it sauce-less. And so I did. And Lucille's did not pass the test on the tri-tip.

SIDES: Hubby had shoestring fries which we both agreed were delicious, and also the peanut slaw, which is a vinegar based cole slaw tossed with peanuts and peanut oil. It also had large pieces of yellow and red bell pepper in it, which made it inedible for me, but Hubby thought it was quite tasty and certainly different from any slaw he'd ever had.  I had the macaroni and cheese and roasted corn. The corn was delicious, but I had no idea it would be on the cob. At Bobby Q's, they roast it, slice it off the cob and serve it in a little bowl, which I prefer. The mac and cheese was an abomination for a place that claims to serve Southern food. I am not sure there was any real unprocessed cheese in it. I have had better from a Kraft Deluxe box.

DESSERT: I am glad we tried the dessert because the banana pudding was the true standout. I have never had banana pudding that has not been from a can, so the homemade version at Lucille's was a treat. It had some pieces of fresh banana and vanilla wafers tossed throughout the large serving (more than enough for 2). It was topped with real whipped cream (not Redi-Whip).

SERVICE: The service was quite good, attentive but not annoying. A manager stopped by our table toward the end, and Hubby made a comparison between Lucille's and Bobby Q's. The manager said that a few other managers had come over from Bobby's to Lucille's, and implied that something was amiss at Bobby's in the overall running of the place. Whatever that is, it is not overt, as Hubby and I never noticed that there was an issue with food quality or service at Bobby's. We decided that we'll give Lucille's 6 months to work out what we hope are some opening bugs, and we'll return to try again. In the meantime, you'll see us at Bobby's."}
{"text":"Loved the meal and Matt! Was here on a biz trip. Delicious chicken and baby back ribs. The southern greens were among the best I've ever had. Preferred the biscuits with yummy honey butter over the cornbread. Leave a big tip and a pen for Matt- superb service!"}
{"text":"I've been dining at Lucille's for several years without problem. however on my last visit I paid for meals with my debit card which was taken and used by a waiter- but not in my line of sight. Subsequently, I was notified by my bank that there were several charges that were unauthorized! While it was at Lucille's the last time the card was used and while my account was cleared of the charges, I can't and will nor officially say the card was abused by an employee there. But.... I cannot see myself going there again. I guess I'd rather err on the side of caution. Caveat Emptor! ron"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time, and for some reason, it worked out that I got to eat my Thanksgiving lunch here. They had a special holiday menu that looked really good, but my friend and I decided to try their traditional barbecue. I got the brisket, and my friend got the pulled pork. The place was PACKED, but the wait wasn't too long (luckily they had a text system so we could wander around the casino until the table was ready), and the hostess was super efficient and knew exactly where to seat everyone. The service in general was extremely good; our waitress was super polite and efficient. The ambiance was homey, the noise, though packed, wasn't loud, and it was safely cocooned in its own area of the casino, so you couldn't smell the cigarette smoke from the casino floor at all. 

The food, though, was disappointing. Both my friend and I got very dry meat that didn't seem to have any flavor to it, and we both thought the garlic mash on the side was reminded us of instant potatoes instead of real ones (which doesn't make any sense, because I'm sure they made it fresh from scratch, but it just tasted like the crumbles you get from a bag - I don't know why). For the price, the food was abysmal. I'd heard good things from friends about the restaurant, so maybe it was just a one-off bad experience, but I wished I had chosen a better place for my holiday meal, and I don't forsee myself returning."}
{"text":"I LOVE Lucille's and have been very happy they opened one here so you don't have to drive all the way down to henderson. My biggest complaint is that the rest aran smells smokey since it's inside the red rock casino. I wonder if there would be less smoke if the restaurant was fully closed instead of being somewhat open to the casino, oh and there are no bathrooms here, you must got out into the casino and find a bathroom, wish there was a sign cause I went on a long journey to find one when there was one to my left walking out that I didn't see until going back. Anywho....

GET THE SWEET TEA. I love me some diabetes tea. The there biscuits are so good with the apple butter. Mmmmm. I could eat a dozen of those. Bbq is good, now I haven't had real Texas bbq, but I'd imagine this is close. I love the spicier bbq sauce that they have on the table. Usually get the tri tip sandwich with Mac and cheese, the apps are delish, and pretty much everything I have had is bomb. The one thing I hate is how busy this place is and there always seems to be a wait to get in. There is a live band so parts of the restaurant gets really loud, but that's part of the feel. Don't forget your tootsie pop on the way out!"}
{"text":"I am such a picky eater and I have to say I absolutely love this place. It's always clean, the staff is incredibly friendly and the food is ample and delicious. I have zero complaints about Lucilles Smoke House BBQ."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for our appetizer. Took forty minutes to get our food order taken. Then waited and waited. Nothing ever came. No appetizer and no food. Poor girl in the bar was the only one working. I give her five stars for trying. Watched multiple groups leave and management well such a joke. Ended up leaving money on table for our drinks and they never even came with our check. Waited ten minutes for someone to make things right. Hopefully next time they can have better service."}
{"text":"I have ordered food to go several times. The food is always fresh and extremely tasty. The food is delicious, although overpriced. However, they have issues when it comes time to pay. I have 3 times out of 3 waited at least 5 minutes to get my tab paid. The system used is ill conceived. I understood when they first opened. Last week (Jan 28, 2014) after waiting 8 minutes to pay the tab, is inexcusable. They also have not had the food ready by the time they suggest I come. This also needs to be ironed out. I have never eaten at the restaurant, so I can not comment. So excellent, tasty food that is a bit too pricey, is still well worth the likely wait you will encounter when you pick up the food."}
{"text":"Excellent!! We just ordered from Lucille's and the baby back ribs are to die for! The BBQ sauce has the perfect sweetness. The fried green tomatoes are a perfect start!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a BBQ place then this is the place to go to! They have tons of BBQ options. With ribs as big as someone's head. The complimentary biscuits with apple butter are to die for. The servings are HUGE so make sure to go on an empty stomach. A suggestion is the beef ribs, pulled pork and smoked chicken and a strawberry/peach lemonade. Aside from the food the service is always great!!"}
{"text":"I tend to entertain guests at Tempe Marketplace and frequent Lucille's because it's likely to be less chaotic and less wait time. Customer service is fantastic almost always. The food was great but this last time it was okay and we had a party of 9. The burgers and sandwiches have gotten boring bland in taste, maybe they forgot the seasoning?  However, it could be just been a fluke so it won't stop us from going back."}
{"text":"The big question on the minds of BBQ lovers in the valley is Memphis or Lucille's. Well, I hate to be the spoiler but its a tie. It depends on the thing your after. Lucille's offers large portions of their signature BBQ with the cooker right in the dining room! They have a fantastic southern drink menu with things like mint julep on it. This place is always busy and has a great outdoor patio. They offer both Memphis and Texas style BBQ which is good, but always makes me wonder if they would do one better if they focused. The take out is awesome though!!! A great night in the district if your interested in good BBQ none the less."}
{"text":"The biscuits with apple butter totally stole the show for me.  If you are trying to cut down on carbs don't go there.  They are truly addicting.  

Service was ok. The waitress was not as consistently attentive and but when she was she was really good about getting us what we needed.  

We got the Front Porch platter which was comprised of chicken, brisket and smokehouse ribs.  We were a huge fan of the chicken and brisket (especially with their BBQ sauce.  The hot and spicy one was the best out of all of them).  The ribs however were much to be desired considering they were burnt.  Really hope to have a better experience with the ribs next time!"}
{"text":"Came here for Memorial Day (big thanks to our service folks) and boy it was good. I order from the happy hour menu and I ended up taking most of my food home ,since I was talking the whole time at the bar( plus I'm a light eater). The Cajun Fish Tacos were good & fresh. The slider's where good as well and I enjoyed the BBQ sauce.  Also order a hurricane and it was on point- it remind me of trip to New Orleans. The onion straws were good as well, but the servings were too large for me. I ate a few and trashed the rest when I got home. The bartender's servers were great and they provided excellent service. I will be come here again. Eat drink and be merry folks."}
{"text":"Terrible host!!  Completely ignored us.  We finally left after 10-15 minutes.  The place wasn't busy at all and like 8 employees standing around doing nothing.  Opt for better service and skip this place!"}
{"text":"I have to say, it's just that darn good. I had the southern chicken dinner over creamy potatoes. It was good I had to see if it was my imagination. It's not."}
{"text":"We all had ribs, shrimp and gumbo and it was really really good! The staff members was very wonderful, always spending interest. Fantastic place!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the better bbq joints I've experienced since my move to Arizona. 

I don't know what it is about Arizona but the food anywhere here is bland. That said, this place has average flavor. I couldn't really taste the smoke on my tri tip and not only that, I suspect my Tri tip was actually brisket. The burnt ends were ok and all of the meat was cooked well. A little more time in the smoker would have made both the flavor and the tenderness better. But it was fine. The spicy bbq sauce saved it all!  (I also liked the bbq mustard sauce!). The corn on the cob had zero flavor. But the biscuits were fab!  As were the fried okra!  The jambalaya we had was pretty good as well, but again, jambalaya is a spicy Cajun dish, this was not spicy.  Good. Just no spice. 

Service was good. The place looked clean. And I'll be back. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"Total disappointed after drooling over the menu I read way too much in.  I wasn't excited about eating at a BBQ place but it was my nieces choice.  Smoked salmon sounded like a good choice considering they smoke thier meats on the premise.  So after all I was looking forward to the meal.  Disappointment #1 they didn't have smoked salmon my first choice.  Disappointment #2 they didn't have the simple syrup to make the drink I ordered.  #3 The fried catfish and shrimp were serverd hot that's the best thing I can say about the entire meal.  HOT not tasty just hot.   #4 My cocktail was strong but far from the drink I expected.   #5 Why play with making mac and cheese, why?   I'm gonna stop counting - the braised spinach was sour , the sweet potatoe mash was pureed yams.  My niece took her chicken home an indication that it wasn't too bad.  She left the sliced beef on the plate.   We didn't order desert ....  We did walk down theb way for cupcakes.   My niece is moving back to California I promised to take her to dinner to un-celebrate her leaving me!  She picked this place, she should probaly question her to decision to leave she's not thinking straight.   The ultimate questions, will I go back?  \"N\" to the NO!"}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ place!  If you love ribs, chicken, brisket, or anything BBQ, and lots of it, this is your place.  If you want a meal without a ton of calories don't come here!  Even before your meal comes you get biscuits with sugar and butter in them!  This is a preview to the food feast yet to come!

The prices are a little steep IMO, but quality is great. 

Service has been excellent every time I've gone too."}
{"text":"The quality of food has gone down. Food comes out warm, dry ribs and quality just isn't the same. I used to like it here."}
{"text":"Slowest Lucille's I've ever gone to.  Normally food comes out very quickly.  Not this one."}
{"text":"Always love coming here! All staff are friendly and courteous. Food is always amazing. Will always keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"So.....my first time to Phoenix Arizona and we saw a Bbq place and decided to give it a shot. I am glad we did as soon as we walked in we were welcome a a big smile and from start to finish we had such amazing service! And the food O.M.G ......you get a ton of food and everything was cooked to perfection!! I want to thank our waitresses  Savannah she was super nice and was always smiling....her manager said she gets a lot of compliments! She must drink some good coffee! ! You can tell people are happy here!! Thank you from the group from Oregon! P.s open a restaurant in Oregon and I would be your #1 customer!"}
{"text":"First time take out.    Ribs overlooked and dry.  Brisket was like jerky.    Beans had weird taste, but that is probably their recipe.    Chicken fingers for our son were pretty bad as well.      Can't see this place sticking around long with better barbecue places close by."}
{"text":"Our first time to Tempe Marketplace and were excited to see a BBQ place.  It was pretty great!  I got the beef ribs, because that is what the hostess said was her favorite, and tri tip with greens.  I don't eat ribs often so was super happy that they were quite wonderful.  I liked the tri tip and was able to add my own sauce.  Greens were good, slightly salty for my taste.  Everything came out HOT and that is AWESOME!  Even my son's fries!  The sweet tea was NEVER the same.  Too much sugar once, not enough the next time.  The fact that they added mint made it all ok :)

We also had fried pickles for an app.  They were decent. We mostly ordered off the lunch menu and it was still a bit pricey.  The biscuits were AMAZING and your drinks are served in huge mason jars so they don't have to refill as much.  Always a plus.  

The waitress was very nice.  All the staff we encountered were nice.  

We enjoyed it and would go back...even though it's 40 miles away."}
{"text":"Bad food. Cole slaw and veggies didn't show up until I asked. Unseasoned catfish fingers and shrimp.  Tips of the rib tips were thinner than a green bean. Oh well, I have a $100 gift card. Guess I will have to buy a box of BBQ sauce. Well the manager Chrissa came by and was so delighted to hear their shortcomings that she comp'd the meal!"}
{"text":"Went back last evening and took some friends for their 1st visit and was again pretty tasty.  We did get some large appitizer platter that I would not get again.  You get large enough portions you really don't need it and it was just OK.  The BBQ / Smoked Tri-tip was again really tasty and the ribs (dry thank you) were again really good.  My friend could not stop talking about the Chicken sandwich he got."}
{"text":"So pretty impressed with this spot in all angels.
Food portions were great and very delicious. 
They have a variety of Teas which is obviously a plus since I'm not a soda fan!
Literally every thing I've tried I find myself thinking about the following day. The appetizers we got were the frieda pickles and the bbq potato chips. I could not have enough! I was in between wanting to eat all the appetizers and saving room for my big burger. They also offer you bread to start and its it was to die for just the right amount of sweet and it melts it was so soft to the touch it practically melts in your mouth.
 My main entree was just as good as it looked in the photo I saw on yelp. I ordered the smoked brisket burger. It was huge and savory. The meat was tender to perfection. There is a large variety of sides you can get and I got macaroni and cheese which was the best mac and cheese I've had in a long time. 
EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS! The service was great our waiter was very attentive I think his name was Alfonso he gave us great service and definitely made our experience with his service 
Can not wait to come back and bring my family next weekend (:"}
{"text":"Visiting from California and stopped by to have dinner with the family. Our server Taylor was great and very attentive. The manager Lori stopped by and made sure everything was to our liking and was everything a manager should be. Being in the restaurant business I always enjoy going somewhere where the food is great and customer service is as well. Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I love barbecue.  I love barbecue so much, that I actually spent time learning how to make it at home.  But, every now and then, I get the inkling to have it somewhere else.  While helping my baby sister move to Arizona, I saw Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que, while walking around Tempe Market Place, and decided to try it.  I should have read the Yelp reviews first. =/

The place was packed, so I assumed that the food had to be pretty good.  Seeking solace from 100+ degree weather was really my first priority.  Yes!  I'm a wimp.  I was missing San Diego weather the moment I crossed the state line.  =(

Prior to being seated, we saw how big the plates were and between the four of us, split two combo platters:  the BBQ combo and the Porch combo. Each plate ran about $25.  Meats included babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork and a half chicken.  Sides included fresh vegetable medley, garlic mash potatoes, fries and macaroni and cheese.   

The chicken, pulled pork and the St. Louis ribs were tasty.  The beef rib and the babyback was just alright.  The side dishes were nothing spectacular.  

Compared to other places that I've tried, I wasn't overly impressed.  The price for a plate of food was pretty pricey, even with the portion sizes.  The side dishes were lacking. But, the customer service was great.  Would I go there again?  Not really.  I'm still in the hunt for some amazing BBQ."}
{"text":"Gave Lucille's another go Friday night.  Both my husband and I ordered different menu items and were pleased with the food - especially since we made a few changes to our order.  Enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich - less the bun and the fries were great.  Wish we had room for dessert, but maybe next time :)  Thanks!"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas and can get away from the strip for a night I would recommend this place.  Located at the district which is still a great little higher end place to shop but without the crazy busy strip location.  The locals eat here though and it is often very busy on weekend so call ahead.  It's the best bbq joint in town.  Be prepared to not eat for the next couple days though because the portions are huge!!! We always get their hand made bbq chips for an appetizer.  Combine that with the amazing complimentary rolls and I'm already pushing my limits.  If I go for lunch I will get one of their sandwiches (usually tri tip) but for dinner you gotta get one of their smoked meats.  I would recommend their baby back ribs that are literally fall of the bone tender! But why stop there, you are already full so add the pulled pork or chicken too haha we use to order a kids meal for my daughter but now we just get a side of their Mac and cheese which is way better than the kids meal Mac and cheese because it for adults (at least that what we tell her)"}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've ever tasted.  And you're talking to a guy who once went to Ft. Worth for a weekend just to sample authentic Texas BBQ!  Every meat item they serve is delicious, and the side dishes are of ample portion.  Chances are you won't finish your meal.  truly a great place if you like BBQ."}
{"text":"My friends and are scattered all over town, and Tempe Market Place seems to be the central location for us all to meet. For whatever reason we always end up at Lucille's and we don't know why. 

The drinks are large, and tasty. The raspberry lemonade has been ruind for us, since a little kid at the booth next to us drank about 5 of them, and threw up on our feet. (The poor restaurant had to re-seat half the section! This kids parents just patted his back, instead of running him to the bathroom... what the heck?!) I was really hoping an old 10% managers discount for that - but nothing. 

The food isn't the worst... but it certainly isn't the best, or the cheapest. I do like the pulled pork, but fast food Dickies does a better pulled pork. 

The bar decor, is very New Orleans, and feels very... I don't know... unsettling to me. I can't put my finger on it. 

Sadly, as indifferent as I am to this place - I am sure we will end up back here, because we ALWAYS end up here. 

One of us needs to speak up, because I can't be the only one that isn't wild about this place."}
{"text":"Wow, loved the food. Got the tri-tip and it melted in my mouth. The service was good, but a little rushed. But all in all a great meal and awesome atmosphere. We will be back. Next time the ribs!!!!"}
{"text":"I have only been to Lucille's Smokehouse once in CA with my Ma and Uncle and it was fantastic! So, much so that when I found out there was once kinda close to where we lived I couldn't wait to take my wife there. We saved money and bought gift cards so we could take a late afternoon during a Saturday and go. My Ma got a gift card of her own too because we wanted to go enjoy the food and show my wife what we thought would be a great place to eat. It turned out not so much.

We went yesterday 5/2/2015 to this location and it was a very hot day. We drove from Glendale, AZ near 67th Ave and Bethany Home. Those in AZ and know what the heat was like yesterday know what that drive can be like. My wife has a heat condition so when we were seated on the indoor patio we sat there for a few seeing if it would cool down and her temp would as well but no such luck. So, we asked if we could be moved just inside where it was much cooler. A hostess came and got us and took us to the other side of the restaurant again tried to seat us just in another area of the inside patio. My Ma asked her for the free table that was just inside from where we had been to begin with. So there we were finally seated and finally could feel cool air. 

We were forgotten several times. We got one order of bread which was hard like it had been sitting out for a long while. No butter with the bread. And then finally came our food and my Ma asked for fresh bread. The waiter said right away. 
My Ma's food was fried chicken (tasted great!), grilled vegetables ( which were boiled and could tell by all the water on her plate), and then gravy for her mashed potatoes which should have had some thickness to it but was like water.
I had mashed potatoes which tasted great, and steak which was suppose to be medium rare but was more like well and was more like a piece of carne asada I would get at a Mexican restaurant and the steak gravy tasted extremely different than it did from the one in CA like they had added a major spiciness to it.
My wife got a  fried shrimp Po Boy to be simple since she didn't want to risk eating anything to heavy with the heat. The shrimp was small - medium size tasted okay. There was 2 tomato slices in the sandwich that were sliced so thick as if they should have been in a hamburger and very bad lettuce. (I would have taken pictures but I try not to take out/or have my phone on when I am out with my family)

I believe when we were just about done eating (about 20 min in) and no one had still come by to see how everything was and no bread still came I believe she was an assistant manager came by and asked how everything was. My Ma let her know how bad it had been. Talking to this manager for about 5-10 min and the waiter starts to come with the bread and she tells him we don't want it no more cause at that point we didn't. We had a very disappointing dinner. My Ma and I both felt bad to take my wife to such a bad experienced dinner.

The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the district manager came over and talked to us apologized for everything and said she'd be sending us out some gift cards to hopefully try them again. And because even though a lot of it was wrong and didn't taste good, some did taste good and MAYBE we caught this place on a wrong day. If we do receive the cards as told then we will return and give it another try after the sun goes down though.


10/10/2015
So, it has taken me a while to come back and do this but I changed the stars to 1 cause about a month after posting this we finally received the gift card from them to go back and it was only for $25 when the manager had said she'd make sure we got all our money back in gift cards so we could go back and have a better experience. We still have the gift card and not sure when or if we'll use it here or wait and see when we can make it back to California or just sell it. Probably be the latter."}
{"text":"One word, food poisoning (read below)I want to give this place a good review but I just can't. Went today and received awful customer service, very slow. The private room we were in was freezing so we asked to turn it off and they server said he would do it ASAP, which he did, but it took 15 minutes to do so. Then as he finishes taking our order, he asks if we want biscuits and apple butter while we wait... Uhm hello apple butter, Yess please. About 20 minutes later 9 out of 11 meals come out, no biscuits yet. Then finally the biscuits come, so much for those coming out while we wait) and my food comes right after. We still had one person who had no food. I will say I was happy when the manager came and addressed the issue saying it should have come out with the rest of the food. She graciously took her meal off the check. Yes we had a larger group but none of us ordered complex food like ribs or pulled pork. Majority was chicken sandwiches. 

My chicken sandwich was pink in the middle and I didn't notice until I got into the middle. Everyone was done eating so I just gave up. Now as I sit here at 4 am, I am wide awake due to being sicker than a dog all night. 

I'm sorry for the one star but food poisoning is no joke. I will say that the apple butter lived up to its name."}
{"text":"This place gives you a hot towel after your meal! For whatever reason, I love that. I even here a few times. Sometimes their food is really good and sometimes it's just alright. I guess that's anywhere you go and depends on who their chef is that day. One thing that I live on their menu that is consistent is the mac and cheese. It's delicious and cheesy!"}
{"text":"Incredible service from the waitstaff and Carissa.  On March 25th, my wife and I had our wedding reception at this location, and they helped to make our day magical.  Months in advance, Carissa worked with us step by step, making sure we were comfortable and ready to go for the big day.  She made the right recommendations, helping us order a good amount of food to make sure everyone was taken care of.  

On the day of, both Carissa and the waitstaff were highly attentive, taking care of our 95-person party well, and everyone was raving about the food and service.  They went above and beyond to help us serve the wedding cake, even though that wasn't a service they normally do.  At our request, they were even willing to prepare to-go meals for individual guests (though we decided not to go that route)!

If we could give a higher rating than 5, we would, and we're so grateful for all that you did."}
{"text":"Lucille's is always a winner in our book for BBQ. The band was a little too loud for us as we sat at the bar. They played fun music, just a little loud. The bar staff was very friendly and attentive, food was great, tasty, and served quickly."}
{"text":"A great place to go if you have a taste for barbque. They give large porportions so you can take out and enjoy later. Try the blackened catfish it's delicious. Everytime I go it's crowded so expect to wait and enjoy a coctail and if you like to dine in a quite atmosphere this is not the place. Service is good and everyone is pleasant. Nice take out menu especially when you want BBQ but don't feel like preparing."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Went for the bread pudding, it was phenomenal, as was the peach cobbler. The waiter recommended a tasty brew, perfect for the weather and paired well with our sausage appetizer."}
{"text":"Great, just like the one I tried in California. Smoked to perfection, I think 12 big boys ordered the family meal for 10+ and it was way too much food. Not even sure if we ate half, I think it's a meal meant for 20."}
{"text":"A great place to go for bbq. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I'm used to bbq down south. There's a huge difference in the way it tastes. Overall I'm happy with this place"}
{"text":"Not a fan of them changing the vegetable side.. it used to be zucchini, peppers, squash and carrots with a really good seasoning.. now it's shredded green beans, shredded carrots and a few little pieces of red and yellow peppers... kind of has the texture of chewing on a rubber tire. Green beans must be cheaper for them to order."}
{"text":"We've come here every week since we moved here. It's our Sunday ritual. There hasn't been one thing on the menu we've tried so far that we didn't like. Their BBQ cheese dip is AMAZING! Wedge salad is great. Ribs, burgers, French fries, biscuits, etc all to die for! And happy hour is always fun! The strawberry lemonade is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Pretty good lunch specials. Great pulled pork sliders. The sauce here is on the sweet side...which I prefer. Overall it was a pretty good meal. The waiter was overly attentive. He would pop out of nowhere and clear the plates and used napkins instantly. It was kinda annoying."}
{"text":"One of my go to Vegas restaurants. The food is amazing. I recommend the fried chicken sandwich- always have enough for leftovers. My wife is a fan of portobello  mushroom burger. And the free sugar biscuits are to die for."}
{"text":"Came here on Father's Day to celebrate with my family, this location is attached to redrock and was quite busy we waited about an hour, which seemed reasonable for the occasion. Our server name was house and he was amazing, he was very friendly and gave great service and had good energy. We all ordered burgers at my table and are happy we did because there were delicious, I ordered the new bacon jam burger and the bacon was crispy which I loved and the sweetness of the bacon jam and the patty worked nicely, I do recommend getting sweet potatoes fries over there regular fries it's just better! Overall spent a great time here with my family and all left satisfied, definitely should check it out!"}
{"text":"0 stars.  No.  Negative five!!!!  This was the worst attempted dining experience I've ever had.   A complete fustercluck of a restaurant.  Perfect candidate for that restaurant impossible show.  TONS of tables empty but told there would be a 30 minute wait.   Grabbed a table near the bar and a waitress took our happy hour drink orders.  20 minutes later still no drinks.  They told us our table was ready and the table they had  for us was almost on top of the hostess table where about 12 other customers were crowded around waiting for tables.  The fact that they would even seat people there is Sad.  (This table btw was empty when we first came in so I don't understand the 20 minute wait for the crappiest table in Town)  We said we didn't want to sit there and they told us it would be ANOTHER 20 min for another table even though there were many empty tables in the restaurant and on patio.  We said we'd go back to our table near the bar and have our drinks there which our waitress had said were \"almost ready\". We went back and the waitress brought our silverware.  We asked where our drinks were and she said they were coming out soon and they were really \"weeded\" tonight.  I said \"we've been waiting twenty minutes\" and she said \"I told them to hurry up already\" she then ran to the computer and typed something in so I don't think she ever put in our drink orders.  We look over at the bar and the bartender is chillin out, looking relaxed leaning up against the bar talking leisurely to a customer.  How long does it take Lucile's to pour a shot and a couple of beers?  I guess I will never know because my party was too impatient to wait more than 25 minutes for our drinks.  Got there at 6:30 to take advantage of happy hour- left at 6:54 very sober and hungry and too late to get to any other happy hours.  If they can't pour a drink in under 25 minutes, I can't imagine how long it would have taken us to receive food.  Everyone who worked there looked and acted like it was their first day on the job.  The only thing Lucile's succeeded in doing was giving me and my fam bam the blues."}
{"text":"This place is a huge chain restaurant, but they are prepared for almost anything. If you love some big sticky BBQ on your hands then it's awesome.  There are even some really great options without eating BBQ.  They're awesome at accomodating big parties too."}
{"text":"Had a taste for Bar-B-Que on last night. My wife and I decided to give them a try. The food and service was excellent. I shall return."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The best BBQ in town. The Baby Back Ribs are perfect! Also try the pulled pork sandwich! You can't go wrong here. What a great lunch."}
{"text":"With a group of 13 service was not the best. As for BBQ.... Its just so so. Dried out food smothered with barbecue sauce. Pricey menu."}
{"text":"The people were great the BBQ Was Even better  . I had the tri tip sand which and it was awesome. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I am from the east coast. When visiting my friend in Vegas we went to Lucilles.
The food, service  and atmosphere was great. The pulled pork is my favourite.
I also enjoyed the artichokes.
I can't wait to go back!"}

{"text":"We tried it again, as Brad the owner reached out to us & they were spot on. Hot meal, great taste, they brought is extra sauce... It was a totally different experience. So happy to be able to put up a positive review & to have a great experience as this restaurant is very conveniently located for us. The ribs we like best are the St. Louis ribs are juicier. I love the portobello mushroom & coleslaw is delish!"}
{"text":"You all know what Lucille's is, great bar b que.  I'm not saying it is the most authentic, down to earth, backwoods southern food but I will say it is darn good southern food and in heaping portions.  The heaping portions are a bit pricey but it's ok to splurge every once in a while.  It's in the district which is always pleasant to stroll around and bar hop afterwards.  They have a pretty good happy hour menu but that is only available in the bar area which is fine.  If you like food, go here, if not, still give it a try because you might just find out you like it."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. It was amazing. My mom and I shared the back porch platter and I have never seen so much food. The two of us couldn't finish it. Will definitely be back there again."}
{"text":"Just had a great meal here. Ribs were done just right, tri-tip was melt in your mouth tender, and the strawberry lemonade was homemade delicious! Service was super friendly! Great place to go."}
{"text":"Great food and great service from our server, Lindsay. By far one of the shortest waits for a meal as well. We can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Loved the salmon there and live band also !! Great time, great food and great drinks that's a winning combination !"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends and I must say the food is over-priced.   Now...the food was good but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I live in Texas so my review is from that perspective.
PROS: The waiter was very friendly and explained the menu to us. The speed of our food arriving was not super fast but reasonable. The sugar biscuits were a definite plus. Unique and yummy. Portions were very generous. The spicy sausage that came with my appetizer ( three types of sausage came with the appetizer) was tasty and there was plenty to share with my 5 coworkers. Drinks were generous as well.

CONS: I prefer that my brisket has a  nice bark with a red ring around the edge. I also prefer my sausage casing to be firm and have a nice pop when I cut it. I had the sausage appetizer. The cheddar sausage ( one of the 3 sausages with the appetizer) tasted like something from the grocery store. Not bad but totally forgettable. The chips with the nachos seemed slightly over-fried. They have appetizer and drink specials during happy hour that you have to walk to the bar to get. This is ludicrous to me. I'm at you establishment, but you are going to charge me more money for the exact same items because I didn't get up and get them myself?!?

OVERALL: Decent service and decent food. I  would have no desire to go back. If you are familiar with Houston, TX I would compare this place to the Pappas BBQ chain."}
{"text":"my boyfriends fav desert is Banana pudding so i saw this place had some and decided to give it a try. who can go wrong with BBg .
we were seated immediately 
our server was very friendly & came out with biscuits and homemade apple butter. 
the food was nothing crazy. 
my phone died so i didn't get to take a good picture 
i got burnt ends , ribs and mashed potatoes.. the mashed potatoes were very good as well as everything else. everything was well seasoned . 
or presentation was horrible lol. the food came out looking like school. it was better then that of course. i would go back"}
{"text":"The Skinny: The food is okay but definitely not special at all - pretty generic actually (3) service: generally good for lunch (3) value: kind of pricey for the quality unless you have a discount (2.5 starred review).

I was introduced to Lucille's BBQ by the hubs. The first time was the location in Henderson which was pretty delish. However over time, the quality of the food definitely degraded to the point that we didn't go anymore.

Enter in the Summerlin branch at Red Rock Casino. As a local, Red Rock periodically sends out coupons to entice you to come visit them. We couldn't resist the BOGO lunch entree coupon so we went twice to check it out.

The biscuits taste a little bit like Bisquick biscuits. But when they are served hot, it is a guilty pleasure all the same.

I would say for their lunch entrees get the BBQ lunch platter ($17ish). Just note, the portions were not very generous for the price. In general, the BBQ meats tasted kind of generic with not enough smoke to the meat. Hence, all the multiple bottles of bbq sauce on the table. It's to cover the relatively bland flavor of the meat. The best thing that we tried was the sausage links.

The sides we tried were the potato salad, the peanut slaw and the BBQ baked beans. The BBQ baked beans were probably the best side there. The peanut slaw and potato salad were both very uninteresting and I could probably do without either one of them. All the portions for these were rather small considering the price.

I tried their BBQ chicken salad entree ($10) and it was totally not worth it. Basically it consisted of a small side salad with hunks of cheddar, a few onion straws and less than 10 pieces of chicken (approximately the size of half a chicken thigh). WTF! It tasted okay but seriously could have provided a more reasonable portion. Even Weight Watcher's probably would have given you more (probably minus the cheese and the onion straws... but who's counting?)

The BBQ pulled pork sandwich ($10) was a more reasonable size but again the meat overall was pretty bland and lacked the smoky flavor.

If you're looking for some good finger lickin' BBQ, this is not really the place to hit. The food here is okay but if you factor in the price/portion ratio it is pretty expensive for what it is. Unless you have a BOGO lunch coupon from Red Rock, I'd probably skip this joint (2.5 starred review)."}
{"text":"I hate to do this to a business but in this case this business has grown too large and forgot about the customer. My wife and I ordered food a couple of Sundays ago when we went on to the yelp menu online. We ordered enough food for six people and the total came out to just over $120 online. I had no problem paying for it so I went to the location and started speaking with the cashier and one of the managers. I let the manager know that I would be ordering roughly $3000 worth of food for Thanksgiving day for my place of employment, as I'm in charge of feeding 160 people. They showed me the catering menu and made sure to remind me that I needed to put the order in well in advance. I've ordered from Lucille's for catering orders in the past several times and the quality of the food has always been good. Not to mention when I'm ordering for 160 people I want a company that can handle that volume and do it right. The food has to be fresh. Well, to my surprise when I was done speaking with the manager I saw my bill for the food that I was ordering right then. The bill was roughly $145, which was about $20 more than I expected. As I have no problem paying for food that I've ordered, the money wasn't the issue however I went online to yelp and saw that the price clearly showed a lower price by about $25. The manager put all of the blame on yelp and said that the yelp website should've been changed a year ago but yelp refuses to work with Lucille's and therefore the price would stand at $145. I can understand that sometimes errors happen however this mistake could happen to anybody and I don't feel that the customer should pay for that so therefore I asked him to remove the $20 difference but he wouldn't do it. No hard feelings, it was the principle of it for me so I refused to pay for the order and they got stuck with a large order of food. The manager wasn't too happy that I refused to pay for the food, however I left out of there without food altogether. I went to another restaurant and ordered my dinner for the night. And a day later I contacted another restaurant in town and ordered $3200 worth of food for my team to be catered on Thanksgiving. I'm now in a position where I need to order roughly $3000 worth of food for Christmas day for my team in one location I won't be considering is Lucille's. Sometimes it's the smallest things that you would think people would want to correct or make right for the customer. I can understand that some people would say that it wasn't their mistake and that yelp should share some of the blame. In my opinion the management wasn't empowered to do what was right for the customer. That decision cost them not only a $20 difference that night but rather $6000 in future business. Only a corporation would make a mistake so foolish as a restaurant with a properly trained management team would understand what the right thing is which is why my business went to a mom-and-pop barbecue shop in town who decided to stay open for me on Thanksgiving day and will do the same thing on Christmas Day and I feel good about giving them the business. I apologize for any spelling errors, but I've been speaking into the phone because I don't have the patience to type a review this long on the phone's keyboard."}
{"text":"Liked the rib tips and potato salad.. everything else seems pretty basic.. sides are not that great.. BBQ sauce is good... carrot cake is terrible even though the bartender said it was really good.. The best thing they have is shortcake which is seasonal and not available for another month ."}
{"text":"Since moving to Vegas, whenever the topic of BBQ comes up, someone always mentions Lucille's.  Despite being very close to the District location, I never made the trip.  Recently I was up at Red Rock Casino around lunch time and thought it was time to try some Lucille's.

Since it was a casual lunch and we didn't want to spend forever in the dining room, we opted to sit at the bar.  Normally we sit at the bar to avoid waiting for a table, but this was about 1145am on a Saturday and there were maybe 20 other diners - in other words, it was empty.

The bartender took our order soon enough.  She was knowledgeable, she was pleasant, she tried to up-sell us on a few things.  She offered us biscuits but not in a manner that suggested they were complimentary (or apparently delicious); it seemed like the last in a long string of up-sell.

Our food eventually came and was decent.  It was not the best BBQ I have ever had.  It wasn't the best BBQ I have had in Vegas.  It was good and satisfying but that's about the extent of it.  DC's mac and cheese was a pitiful attempt at mac and cheese.  It was stringy and mushy and flavorless.  His chicken sandwich, ordered with ranch dressing on the side, also came with a healthy slathering of ranch on the sandwich itself.

The bartender checked on us once, right as we were taking our first bite.  Despite that fact that she was never more than ten feet from us, she never checked in again.  In fact, the only time she acknowledged us again was when we were laughing at something on the TV and she turned around and asked \"what's so funny? are you laughing at me?\"  It was an odd question to ask and a little off-putting.  I'm not always the nicest person but I dont laugh out loud at someone when he or she is within arm's reach.

All told it was just a mediocre experience at Lucille's.  The food was alright.  The service was questionable (especially since it was quite empty).  I may still have to give the Henderson location a try, but I will keep on moving past the Red Rock version."}
{"text":"Well I have to say, Lucille's corporate is on point with getting to their customers.  After a previous review of not being pleased with the service I received at their establishment, they sent me a complimentary card to give them another chance. I took them up on this opportunity a few days ago with a good friend, and what a difference.  Our server was phenomenal!  Very attentive, courteous, happy, and genuinely seemed like a good person.  Promptly took our orders, let us know about the specials they had going on, and did everything with a smile.  Thanks to Christina I will be coming back to this place again.  The food was good as always, but the service always makes it taste better."}
{"text":"I am not a big BBQ eater but this place was pretty good. My friends like it so I go with them from time to time. It would not be my choice for dining but the times I have been there were pretty good and the food too. Not very expensive and right at Tempe Marketplace. The service was good and beer cold. My favorite was the corn bread and sweet tea."}
{"text":"Three of us went for dinner for the first time last night at Lucille's. We were seated right away and the service, while not overly friendly, was efficient. 

I really loved the decor. Yes, it is a little corny, but it's also homey and comfy! Our hostess mentioned the 'smoker' so I knew I had to order some sort of smoked meat. 

The brisket was awesome! Fall apart tender and delicious as well as flavourful. Between our table, we also had baby back ribs and the jambalaya. The greens that came as a side weren't the best though, that's why the last star is missing. But overall, most everything was delicious and the portions were huge! I would recommend this place for sure. Get the brisket!"}
{"text":"Baby back ribs were cooked to perfection. They weren't slimy or greasy, they were just darn good. French fries were thin and crispy, although I did request them extra crispy.

Service was very good. Seated fast and the food came out sooner than I had expected.

Sometimes it's the little things: instead of those stupid little wet wipes in foil packages they brought out a full-blown warm wash rag. That was a great touch.

And best of all, this was probably one of the most reasonably priced full rack of ribs I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, I was not looking forward to going to a BBQ place. However, I had one of the best portobello mushroom sandwiches of my life here. 

The service was great, especially seeing as today is thanksgiving. I like their 'team' concept, everyone seemed very nice and helpful. 

I did notice their systems were a little inefficient. In order to get a side of sauce, they put it into a computer that relays it back to the kitchen. I waited 15 minutes for a side of Ranch, which by then, I didn't even need. No fault to the waitress though. The hostesses were not very friendly either. 

The others in my family got the Tri-Tip {supposedly melt in your mouth} and the cheeseburger. We were overall quite impressed. The onion straws were great! We will be back again."}
{"text":"I guess I just have bad luck with this place. First time I ordered was about 4 months ago (ordered to-go), 
I was told my food will be ready for pickup in 20 mins. I got there 30 minutes later, waited at the pickup 
window for 10 mins, just for them to say, Oh, sorry, it'll be another 10 mins. I finally walked out with 
my meal about 20 mins later. The food was ok, (I got the baby back ribs). I lived in the south so I know 
great barbecue when I taste it. It wasn't bad, but wasn't mindblowing. 
Fast forward to yesterday. I was craving ribs so I called to place an order for pick-up. I'm thinking there's 
no way they'll mess things up twice, and the food was decent enough to give it another try. I was told my food will be 
ready in 20 mins. This was during my lunch break so i had limited time. I drove over to pick it up 30 minutes later. 
Lo and behold, I was met with errs and uhhs, the genius that took my order didn't put it in. He said \"well, I didn't put
it in, I'll put it in right away...\" I was so irate. I'm standing there starving with limited time for lunch. I asked how 
long it'll take, he said another 20 minutes. I just had to walk off. No point throwing a tantrum and wasting my energy. I 
figured I'd reserve my energy for this review. 
I highly doubt I'd be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey but the food is great the drinks are great the mixed drinks are great. I have the pulled pork sandwich absolutely wonderful the fried pickles were fabulous ,I love their mashed potatoes. I've been here a few times and when I have the money in the pocket I will go there again. It's a nice place to take guest for some good bbq."}
{"text":"I am updating this review that I previously wrote! The manager reached out to me apologizing for my experience with the host and she appreciated the honest review so that her team can improve. Taking the time to read my review to make the experience as good as the food is what it's all about! Thank you for listening to your customers! 

Such good food!! If you love BBQ this is the place to go. The food is so amazing and our waitress was super friendly and had great suggestions when I was torn on entrees. If you love pulled pork you have to try the pulled pork queso dip! And haveeee to get the biscuits with apple butter! OMG!  

The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because of the host at the front. I didn't catch his name since he didn't have a name tag on but he was not warm and welcoming which is the whole point of having a host! I asked him where the restrooms were and he completely ignored my question and began talking on the headset he was wearing for about a minute before saying \"what did you say?\" Was not a good way to start the meal but other then that, everything else was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to eat here about a month ago. It was about 9pm so we decided to sit in the bar. The bartender approached us immediately and started is each off with a beer. His name was JP and he was very friendly. We decided to order a rack of ribs and fried pickles for our meal. The food came and it was fantastic. The ribs we juicy and tasty and the fried pickles were just as delicious. We had an overall great experience, but what made this experience was the customer service that we received from JP. He was friendly and attentive and also very entertaining. When we left the restaurant my boyfriend and I were not only full, but we had smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"From the previously frozen corn on the cob to the mediocre BBQ sauce, this place is the pits. I do like the way they throw all the 1950s furnishings and finishes in there randomly, and our waitress was good, but the food was weak and the people around us were getting horrible service. The table across from us sat there after finishing their meal waiting for the waiter to come back for almost the entire time we were there, and when he asked the host for the tab, he told the guy he should go find his waiter.

Fried green tomatoes were OK, but not great. Sauce was actually pretty good; the highlight of our meal.

The backbone of good BBQ is a good dry rub, and my chicken had none. I'm more of a fan of KC style BBQ, and I don't appreciate when it arrives already slathered in sauce, so I asked for mine dry. That was a mistake, as what came to my table looked like no more than a roasted half chicken. It didn't really taste slow-cooked either, and the meat did not fall apart like it should. Hell, I can cook a beer can chicken in 90 minutes and it falls off the bone. I don't believe they cooked this for half a day as they claimed. Even with any of the three sauces--which couldn't go head to head with Open Pit or KC Masterpiece--left me very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've not been disappointed! The food is really good, chicken is moist, tri tip melts in your mouth. The sweet tea is great and beer iced cold."}
{"text":"Ok lets start off with the positive, friendly server. Now the negatives, 1. It took precisely 1 hour and 35 minutes for our food to arrive! 2. When the food did arrive it was freezing cold. 3. The food didn't taste that good, i ordered the barbecue chicken sandwich with applewood smoked bacon which sounded appetizing on the menu yet when i received my sandwich the chicken was dry and the bacon had a similar texture to cardboard, it was far worse than microwavable bacon, and frankly i didn't even think it was bacon just some fake processed \"bacon flavored\" plastic. 4. The food didn't arrive all at once as it normally does at most restaurants, it came dish by dish, when one person finished there dish another one had arrived, and ironically (me being the only \"yelper\" of the group) my dish came last. I do understand they were swamped due to it being christmas day and all but this is flat out unacceptable. However they do have decent ribs. The only reason i gave this place 2 stars is because of our extremely nice server who was empathetic to the fact the kitchen had delayed our food and also because after speaking to the manager about our \"lovely christmas dinner\" he offered to comp our meal. If i ever do come here again ill make sure i will arrive 2 hours earlier then when i plan on eating."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years I don't know why I'm just now writing a review. I've lived in the south and my whole family is southern. I. Know. BBQ. Maybe I haven't ventured out enough because I'm fearful of ruining my taste palette for southern flavor but this is BY FAR the best BBQ I've had in Vegas. Fresh, homemade and quality food. A little bit on the pricey side but everything here is amazing. The biscuits, the sauce, the quality of meat, the green LAWD HAVE MERCY THE GREENS! I can always tell how good a BBQ place is by their greens and let me tell you, y'all are pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Lucille's in GV and was stoked when I heard this location had opened. We decided Thanksgiving was as good a day as any to check this place out for some Thanksgiving dinner...even though we went for lunch. They take reservations both online and via phone, which was great for us because I had to ensure that I had enough time to eat and then go to work afterwards. 

Lucille's Thanksgiving dinner meal consisted of turkey or honey ham (of half of each, which is what we got) with gravy, green bean casserole, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, biscuits w/ apple butter and a small personal pumpkin pie. The food was delicious and we even had leftovers because we couldn't finish it. The best part was the personal pie that was amazingly creamy and served with tons of whipped cream.

The staff was nice and I like how they work as a team instead of customers only being able to flag down their assigned waiter/waitress like traditional restaurants. I also loved that they had TVs everywhere in the dining area so we were able to catch glipses of the Thanksgiving Day parade and football game while we were there. Definitely will be back to have some of their more traditional BBQ grub!"}
{"text":"First time here and our waitress Jessica was the best... we will be returning...
Meals were perfect and service was spot on!"}
{"text":"Oh man I am still hurting. I swear i gain like 10 lbs. Dinner for 7 came out to be about close to $200 with tip. The tri tip was good but everything seemed a little to sweet but good. One of my friends order the greens for his sides he said he like them so much that next time he wants 2 of the same sides. I had corn on the cob and show string fries good. I tasted the salmon salad was really good and was very large. My other friend ordered a pork ribs full order and we watched him knock it out as well over all a good place to eat. service very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Just wanted to provide an update...Lucille's management team reached out to offer their apologies re: my experience & an opportunity to try Lucille's again. We did. We went for dinner again. Tri-tip was awesome. Burgers were delicious. Nothing was unavailable. It was so good in fact, I recommended Lucille's for lunch to co-workers in town from AZ the following day. They still talk about how good the food was. Thank you!"}
{"text":"High profile BBQ in Tempe marketplace that is way over priced for my taste.  I'm from Colorado so I know what good BBQ tastes like and great cuts of meat.  Had the brisket which was dry and not well cut.  The beans, on the other hand, were awesome!  

This restaurant is more notably known for its ribs (based on the fact that everyone else was ordering it) and the price was upwards of $30 for a full rack.  Normally, I would say that is ridiculous to pay for ribs, but if they are that good I would gladly pay that.  

I will be going back to try the ribs of course and may change my review based on that.  But for now this review is a 3 star because of the dry brisket.  Only reason this was not a 2 star is because of the service which I rarely care about in a review.  But here, when a 2 top spends upwards of $80 on a bill for mediocre meats,  you better believe your going to get good service and it was!  Props to all that serve there and management that trains them.  D- for the staff that chooses the meats and length of time to cook good BBQ."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch at Lucilles. Been hearing friends and coworkers raving bout this place and the fried pickles so me and my boyfriend went for lunch. Fortunately it was happy hour and not that busy so service was pretty good.

Started with the fried pickles and Irish nachos (great deal for happy hour!) but not into the pickles... The nachos were okay. Cheese got cold and hard.... Not bad but not great.

We shared a full rack ribs with beans and peanut slaw as our sides. Before we got our food, they brought out 2 biscuits and apple butter. Yumm!!! Must've been the best part about the meal. Then came to food... The ribs were a bit dry and not tender. The beans are too sweet. The peanut slaw was alright..

Thought I'd give it another chance by ordering dessert. And glad I did! I got red velvet cake with ice cream.. I am a sucker for red velvet cake! And I really liked it. But you can tell it's been sitting; the icing was kinda hard. But still pretty good. My boyfriend got the snickers ice cream pie thing. Yummy but real rich and real sweet. Big serving!

Overall, decent service, moderate food with big portions, good biscuit and dessert. 3 stars... maybe my expectations were just too high from reading such good reviews.. but I'd go Famous Daves over this place anyday."}
{"text":"Worst food I ever had!!! Cardboard BBQ!!!! YUCK! 


I was hoping for amazing BBQ because of all the good reviews. I asked him if they had fatty brisket or lean and he said it's all the same! ALL THE SAME?!?!!!?!  NO It's different!! I wanted to try it anyways.. 

I ordered the brisket with cole slaw and when it came out it looked like cardboard. I poked at it and it was hard. It's pathetic to have a restaurant name BBQ if they can't even perfect brisket. I told the guy to take it bad and I ordered wings instead...the wings aren't good... I should of ordered salad.. you can't screw that up. 

This place is like a Olive Garden, Chili's, Red Lobster for BBQ. Real nasty food. Nothing special about it at all. If you never had BBQ you probably wouldn't mind, but if you are like me who will travel 3 hours or more to eat BBQ don't bother going here. GO TO LITTLE MISS BBQ!!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be the best spot for bbq in town. Seems the quality has gone down a bit.  Mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were virtually tasteless. Steamed veggies are now string beans and peppers? Ribs still had great flavor though and are top notch."}
{"text":"Great place for good bbq! Service is friendly from experience and food is amazing. I recommend the brisket nachos Crisp tortilla chips layered with melted cheese and piled high with smoked brisket. For dinner I recommend  he Mardi Gras Chicken! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Love it here so delicious I would definitely recommend getting the jam bacon burger .............."}
{"text":"Wow this place had gone way down hill since the last time I was here. My main issue is with the food. Their BBQ used to be great and I had thought it was one of the better BBQ joints in town. But this time around the meat was dry and inedible in my opinion. I'm from Texas, where lean, overcooked, dry brisket goes straight to the trash instead of being served. Also, who chops their brisket without advertising it as such? Brisket should never be chopped, always sliced! It's not pulled pork so if you want to serve it chopped then state so in the menu! 

Service was another issue as our server kept appearing at all the wrong times. Basically when we needed something, like the check, he was nowhere to be found for long periods of time. And yet he kept stopping by and interrupting us when we didn't need anything at all. How annoying!

I left this meal feeling very disappointed and dissatisfied. I basically felt like I wasted a bunch of money because nothing about the meal was enjoyable or memorable. Will likely not be returning and definitely not recommending to others!"}
{"text":"Horrible. This is not the barbecue you're looking for. Nothing is cooked/smoked properly. The food was lukewarm and pretty tasteless. Beans were disappointing. Ugh. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I went here for my Anniversary.  I gave 4 stars because of a few things.... The hostess would not seat me in a more quiet place as requested even though they had the room.  Later they let us seat at a table kitty corner to the noise after I begged.

We got the 2 person platter for 49.99 which had more than enough food for us and was a decent deal.  The only issue we had was 1 rib was so dry that it was jerky.  When you sell a product by the rib, it should not have left the kitchen.  We told the waiter who offered to replace it.  The place was pretty busy and we had to remind him about his offer, by that time we were at desert which they advertised \"Best Ever Chocolate Cake\".  When you see a desert this brazenly named, we had to answer their call to the challenge.  The cake was delicious, it was moist, tasty and huge (enough for 4 people or 1 'Murican).

The manager came by and we took the opportunity to inform him about the rib (since he asked) and he offered to take the cake off the bill.  I promised him a review, and I NEVER write reviews....come to think of it YOU should write a review on my game I created: DinoMight: Master the Might of Evolution available on Amazon.com It took a year of my life and 10 years off my sanity to complete.

We tipped 20% because the service was decent and ALL waiters need to be tipped guys!  PLEASE DO NOT TIP ANYTHING LESS THAN 15% or you are a MONSTER."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place and very busy. We came in on a week night, I was surprised how really busy it was.  We sat on the Porch, which is just an addition made to look like an old Southern style home.  It is nice. Nice old 50's style furniture. I like it!

I had some Watermelon flavored Ice Tea.  It was truly good. Even had a slice of watermelon with it.  We had green fried tomatoes as an appetizer. So so on that not too good.  Dinner was quite good though. BBQ chicken, some ribs and briskest
We had enough to bring home for yet another dinner
Our server was very good, her name was Allison. She went into a lot of detail about the menu items. I did appreciate that certainly.

Dinner was good and the side BBQ sauces are an added plus."}
{"text":"I do not go crazy for barbecue, but when I do have a crave, I NEED some Lucille's!!! I can just die for their baby back ribs and their potato salad!!! I am not really crazy about much else on the menu but those two are my favorite!!! The place and location are perfect too because I no longer have to drive all the way to Henderson : )"}
{"text":"Love love love the food from here. We usually order to go and they always have extra of everything. I do appreciate how when ordering and picking up to go, they check your bag to make sure everything is there before you leave. Good food, good service."}
{"text":"Said it was a 30 minute wait. Waited 27 minutes. 
Meat was great quality. Full of juicy goodness. 
Ordered half rack of ribs with corn on the cob x2 and mixed veggies (more like zucchini) and half chicken/burnt ends/rib tips with corn and mashed. Hubby had to take the chicken home the portions were so big.
Worth the $ for the quality. 
And who can resist hot towels?
Waitress overcharged for an extra tea but it was quickly fixed. Hence the 4 stars."}
{"text":"We have been to Lucille's before and this one is just as good as the others. Our waiter was awesome, we received refills fast and never felt ignored. I was starving so we started with some onion straws(half order - that looked like a full order). The biscuits were a great start. The wife had the pulled pork and garlic mashed potatoes, she was happy with her choice. I had the Mardi Gras Chicken, I loved it!!! The kids tried the ribs and chicken, they left full and happy too. 

Always a good place to eat for families."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I give this place four stars instead of five is because the service was lacking a bit. It took forever for us to get drinks/extra napkins/ketchup. 

Other than that, the food was outstanding. We came here on Memorial Day because we were too lazy to do our own grilling, and after smelling our neighbors cooking some ribs, we just had to have them!

We got the fire roasted artichoke for the table. My only complaint is that the artichoke was not very meaty and if I'm paying $10 for an artichoke, it shouldn't be small with leaves that hardly have anything to grab at. The garlic/mayo dipping sauce was delicious! 

My gf and I shared the Lucille's platter - it came w/ two chicken breasts, four ribs, a few slices of tri-tip meat and two sides. We opted for corn and french fries. Every single bite of this meal was delicious. The rib meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and the chicken was impressive too (usually chicken is just blah for me). The tri-tip was absolutely phenomenal. We ate the entire platter and brought one huge chicken breast home, so these serving sizes do not mess around! The corn was also really really good. It was obvious that it was fresh and grilled and there was some type of pepper butter on it that was extremely flavorful. 

All in all, I will definitely be back the next time I'm craving some southern BBQ.

Be weary, the prices are a little high compared to other BBQ joints around time, but I do think the quality of food and the preparation is worth it!"}
{"text":"Decent food, tad pricey for quality. The service is what drags this place down. Second time I've gone there and had silverware or cups covered in makeup from someone else. Do you clean your plate ware??? After asking for new clean cups they tried charging me for them. 
Food is hit or miss, but don't expect your server to care. Once they drop it off you won't see them again until they bring you the incorrect bill."}
{"text":"Just finished my lunch here. Took 20 minutes + just for apps that came out cold. We had to send an order back to be warmed up and received it when we were done eating, pointless. Also when I was being served my salad the waitress reached over my grandfather sitting next to me instead of walking three feet to my side of the table to properly serve me. Um when is that ok? When I unintentionally gave  a weird look she was super rude. Definitely my last time here, as well as my family and friends. Hire intelligent people!"}
{"text":"This was our first time trying the place out. Our friends raved about the food. We of course had to try it out for ourselves. We ordered the baby back ribs with cheese grits and corn and the back porch with beef ribs, garlic mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and potato salad. Both were delicious. Service was great! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Without planning, Lucilles has ended up being a place we go to every time we are in town... Located right in Tempe Marketplace, it's a huge restaurant, we different themed dining areas. They are great for large groups. 

Service here each time has been friendly. Our beverages (in HUGE mason jars) and food (huge portions), all brought to us within good time frames... 

You get complimentary biscuits that come warm in a basket with their Apple butter, a good way to start! 

Last night, I ordered one of their platters (chicken + 2 other meats + 2 sides). The chicken and brisket was tender, no knife needed. But the tri tip ends were just a bit tough in comparison, so I didn't eat much of that.... Corn was standard... I also got their peanut slaw, it was a greasy because of its oil/vinegar base. I wasn't a huge fan, but it's all in preference. Their cornbread with lots of honey and butter though, yummy! I tried a piece of their baby back ribs off my husband's plate, pretty good too... Everything was lathered in BBQ sauce. And like said earlier, huge portions, between hubby and I, we probably took home 5 lbs worth of leftovers! 

So in conclusion, maybe not the highest quality BBQ, but this place is a fun spot to eat at. Food and ambience is good. You can also walk around after, which is what we have been doing... 

I also have to mention the huge basket of tootsie pops at the take out counter in the front, cute!... And the fact that we were given warm wet hand towels after our meal.. Nice details!...

Ps, I see a lot of reviews complaining that this place is too expensive... I guess coming from out of town where this is the normal price range, I didn't really notice! And also, for the third time, portions of enormous!"}
{"text":"Love the BBQ chicken and baby back ribs.  I didn't care for the peanut cole slaw just didn't taste as good as I remember. The praline cheesecake was meh. I would go back because I love the BBQ and when I need a fix it gives me what I need."}
{"text":"Took my daughter to Lucille's on the recommendation of my boyfriend. Bad Idea! The food was COLD. The Best thing there to eat, was the Bar B Q Sauce. I was SO disappointed! We had the 1/2 slab of ribs, baked potato with everything, and corn on the cob. With some nasty strawberry like kool aid like drink. First of all our food was not cold, not warm, but is was definitely COOL to the touch. Plus the place aint cheap. Our meal came to $60.55. And we didn't even finish our food. Wait, take that back.  The Biscuits w/Apple Butter were the best thing we ate of the meal. Wish we had went ahead and went to LoLo's instead. Wont be back to Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ. I liked Famous Dave's better. And their prices were more reasonable."}
{"text":"I had never been here before tonight and I'm not quite sure why. I like the ambiance, it's very old diner- like. The service was good. At the end of the meal they give you warm, wet towels which reminded me of flying first class. I ordered the Lucille's cheeseburger with mac & cheese. The burger was one of the better burgers I've had in a while. The mac & cheese was really good as well. I was so excited that we were given spear dill pickles with our sandwiches. I definitely need to come back here and try the ribs. The BBQ smell is intoxicating."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch. The service was fast and friendly.

I ordered beef rib with two orders brisket burnt tips. Overall the food was average. The rib was a bit too overcooked for me. 

I've had much better bbq places!"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was excellent.  I would go back and I really like the extensive menu.  The location is great...there are shops and other restaurants all around."}
{"text":"Great BBQ restaurant located inside Red Rock Casino. I ordered the Texas beef brisket with macaroni & cheese and baked beans. While I was disappointed with the baked beans, the macaroni & cheese was the probably the best I've ever had. And the brisket was excellent!"}
{"text":"We were feeling BBQ today so we decided to try out Lucille's. Although it is located in Red Rock Casino, stepping into the restaurant transports you out of Las Vegas and into a swanky Southern dive. 

Service was nice but definitely on the slower side, especially considering that we beat the dinner rush and it wasn't too busy yet. The meal comes with complimentary biscuits and a spiced butter. Biscuits are topped with a sugary crust and the butter is okay but didn't taste like anything to me. This is the first place I've been to that serves a sweet bread as a starter rather than a savory one. 

The food was tasty. I got the Memphis style pulled pork sandwich, which has a potato bun and mustard slaw. Side of sweet potato fries. The meat was tender, though I would have preferred a regular coleslaw instead of the mustard one. Boyfriend got the half chicken with brisket and rib tips. His was good as well, with the chicken being the most flavorful out of the three meats. 

Price-wise, it's on the expensive side, probably because of the casino location. If you were to bring your family, it's not the easiest on the wallet, but the quality of the food and the portion sizes make Lucille's a decent dining option at Red Rock."}
{"text":"Cheers to Lucille's for surprisingly good bbq and service. I had (brace yourselves) tri-tip, burnt ends, chicken, corn in the cob, Mac n cheese, salad and a lemonade! Everything was really good. I'm not sure if it was really good because it was free at a work event with my entire company but depending on the prices I'm sure I would have enjoyed it just as much. I cant comment on the fees or what each item costs but I can tell you that my belly is happy!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in tonight's service. Apparently it takes half an hour to cook a well done steak. Then why was my meal cold when it finally arrived. tsk tsk tsk... CHECK PLEASE..."}
{"text":"I love BBQ! I love BBQ that I don't have to travel far for. I want good BBQ! Luculle's is deliverable on that, to some extent. It really is a hit or miss here, more service wise but sometimes food wise. The majority of my dining is done in the day here. And we've come to the conclusion that sitting in the long big booths beside the bar are cursed. But in my restaurant world mind, I know why we usually get crappy service here. The bartender. This is the bartenders section and the day bartender always has sidework that has to be completed for the night bartender. SO their tables are a forethought in their mind. But I see her looking at us out of the corner of her eye and she's thinking let me finish this last lemon, or let me just finish prepping garnishes or re-filling mixers...but you took too long to finish and while we are here for a quick and speedy lunch, it always fails. We often have to ask for the biscuits, to tell her we are ready to order-which she probably already knows because as I said I saw her looking at us, for refills, the check, a box. As soon as the check dropped she was all smiles and thank you's. Nope, I don't fall for that and I am happy to educate the people that do not know better for they shall not be taken advantage of. 

The food is good. The portions are either too small or ridiculously big! Once I got a BBQ chicken salad for lunch, it was served to me in a soup bowl. UGH! Half of it ended up on the table after having to cut the large lettuce pieces. It was a $10 salad in a soup bowl. Their lunch prices and items are decent selection. 
On another visit I got, I think it was a special, BBQ chicken lettuce wraps. Could I have some more toppings with my lettuce. Thank you! But overall it lacked flavor anyway and I didn't finish it. The best things are their Fried Green Tomatoes with the Red Pepper Sauce! So yummy! 

Let me say though, I have had dinner at this location once and everything was great that night, service and food! 

Their drinks are probably the second best thing...their GIANT quart sized drinks will give you a sugar stroke if you are drinking pop but if you get their iced teas they are so good! Peach and Watermelon and they are not flavored with syrups! So they are unsweetened. That makes me a fan. The other is their cocktails while I've only had one at this location, Lucille's Big Peach, it was strong without being gross and I love peaches! 

I'll be back, it's not awful but I hate that I have to be sure to ask for a certain sections and have to limit what's good and not good on the menu when I like everything!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing every time! They have the best BBQ food in town. The servers are friendly. They checked on me and my husband several times to make sure everything was okay. I definitely recommend Lucille's BBQ."}
{"text":"Plenty of leftovers when you eat at Lucile's. The portions are enormous. Food is good, casual dining and lively atmosphere. Outdoor seating is great if you want to get away from the indoor noise. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I don't know why I had never written a review of this place.  Lucille's is the place where I get my fix for a giant (full rack) BBQ pork ribs!  I love them just the way they come out on the plate.  I don't even to use those extra sauces on their table.  Their St. Louis style BBQ beef ribs are awesome, too!

I took my old friend from San Francisco who was visiting Las Vegas over to Lucille's, and he was excited and even exceeded his expectations.  The only place I remember which is comparable with Lucille's was \"Bobby Rubino's Place for Ribs\" which used to be right on the Fisherman's Warf waterfront in San Francisco.  It actually used to be \"DeMaggio's\" owned by Joe DeMaggio until Bobby Rubino's came to town and bought the place.  Now, I believe they changed hands with \"Joe's Crab Shack.\"  Any rate, Bobby Rubino's was my place for ribs when I lived there.

A few years back, I found Lucille's over in Henderson, Green Valley Ranch District and I was totally overjoyed!

I still have toss-ups between ordering pork ribs and beef ribs because they're both my favorites.  I always order the onion straws for an appetizer, and that dipping sauce which tastes like aioli sauce with BBQ accent is absolutely out of this world.

Well, there was one thing out of the menu that I almost spitted out of my mouth when I bit into it and chewed on it....  My dear friend wanted to challenge something weird, and he ordered the fried pickles.  I already knew what it was going to turn out to be.  I just can't stand cooked pickles!  Nope, not even cooked cucumbers!  That is disgusting!  It shot my mind back to the 90s, where a \"Valley Girl (San Fernando Valley)\" would say 'Grody to the max!!' or something like, 'Gag me with a spoon!' and that's exactly how I felt, sending shivers up my spine.  I literally almost spit that awful thing full force right in my friend's face from my mental state of chaos and shock.  He just ordered it as a conversation piece; but, it never made it to a conversation.  He hated it, I hated it even before he ordered it, but never imagined a cooked pickle can be so disgusting.  I could even gargle and wash it down with prune juice if I had to.  I bet they put that on the menu for someone just like my friend who likes to play Russian Roulette with food.

Lucille's is always fun to go."}
{"text":"Had another great meal here.  Ribs are the best.  Tender and plentiful."}
{"text":"Definitely no complaints. Everything our family ordered was amazing. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone who loves barbecue."}
{"text":"Way to over priced for what it is. You can get better bbq for cheaper at a local hole in the wall joint."}
{"text":"I'm not a math major so if everything in this review doesn't add up to a 4 star my bad. Lucille's can be a 2 star on one day, a 5 star on another, a 4 star on another, and a 3 star another. Luckily I've never had a 1 star.

The interior, exterior, and environment are very cool. There's an outdoor patio and a live band. There's a bar. It's located in the District and near the Green Valley Ranch Casino. They have a huge BBQ smoker right in the middle of the dining area which I thought was just for show until they started bring out a ton of meat and loaded it. They serve drinks in a mason jar. Their BBQ sauce is good and can be purchased. Their accommodating for large groups. All very cool things.

Their food for most parts was alright, sometimes inconsistent. I've been here a few times and had decent BBQ ribs for a chain restaurant but satisfying. I've had ribs where the meat just pulled off the bone. Most recently it was pretty overcooked and barely had any meat on it. What little meat it had tasted good for something tough chewy but everything else was good. Sometimes the portions are huge and sometimes they aren't, you leave hungry.

It's a good place to chill and hangout, watch a game, have a few drinks, and eat some BBQ. If it was around the corner I'd be here almost everyday but not always to eat. I'd probably be back if out of town visitors or others wanted to go or if I was in the area. There's another Lucille's closer to me now though."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, and recommend it to everyone I know. I haven't had a meal I didn't love, from the tri tip to the St Louis ribs, hot links, BBQ shrimp... Goodness. Go get the two meat combo with any sides and be prepared to count the hours until you can go back. Also, don't miss the biscuits and apple butter."}
{"text":"Although the food is absolutely delicious, it is just way too overpriced for a BBQ joint.  I feel like you can get the same quality at Rudy's BBQ for way less and for bigger portions.  The kids meal was $6.99 and my husband and I shared brisket for $24.99.  We saved cash by going with water only except for our sons chocolate milk.  The saving grace that pushed them a little over the top was their biscuits which were mouthwatering morsels of honey butter goodness.  I wouldn't go back again other than for maybe special occasions."}
{"text":"This Lucilles is one of our favorite places. By favorite I mean we come here every single weekend. We're  both huge gym goers and eat here as our cheat meal. Let me tell you, it's an epic cheat meal. We've mastered our order by now so I'll break it down for you. I'm vegetarian (I know a vegetarian loving a bbq place but bear with me) so I get the garden burger. I replace the grilled onions with  the onion straws and get a side of ranch and sweet potato fries. The burger is perfect this way. It's not meant to taste like meant fyi. The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. A lot of times, sweet potato fries can get soggy and that has never happened here. It's a delicate balance between soggy and crispy. These nail it. 

My fiancé gets the roasted half chicken with a side of macaroni and a baked potato. The baked potato is always perfectly cooked, never dry. The chicken is juicy and super savory. It has a smoked flavor that is incomparable to anything else. Smoked meat is one of their specialties and it shows. The mac and cheese has a fresh layer of cheese on top. It's incredibly rich and creamy. We like to dip it in ranch, no surprise there. Their house sauce is delish too! 

Oh! I almost forgot the biscuits! They give you complimentary biscuits. They are warm, crumbly and dusted with sugar. They give you a side of cinnamon butter. We also get a honey with the biscuits. It's a hassle sometimes to get but it's a necessity. Seriously you need the honey. Please trust me on this. 

As for the service, with the description I just gave.... who cares. But in all seriousness, the service is good. Not great but good. They get really busy and sometimes they forget our excessive ranch or our honey. They operate as a team so you can grab anyone in black. Funny enough, the first time we didn't like the food but we gave it another shot and fell in love. 

Oh and a live band on saturday. Sooooo get your butt to Lucilles and get yourself a food baby."}
{"text":"The best beef BBQ ribs in the country.  That is no small review.  They are amazing and literally that good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot.  The lemonade was definitely much improved, and some of the food was good.  The pulled pork was a little greasy, but the pork ribs were great.  

I would be temped to give this place three stars, but not at a bill of $20.  For lunch.  \"Overpriced\" is still the best way to describe the joint."}
{"text":"Yowza! Just the word I needed to describe Lucille's BBQ in the District. 

I'm dined here on numerous occasions but since my very last experience was last night, here I am. 

Checking in at the hostess stand was a breeze, I find there system for paging you when your table is ready effective, they take your cell phone number and text you when your seat is ready. Clever, yes, but I'm sure there are still folk out there acrewing charges on their wireless bill over waiting on a dinner table. 

Anyway, let's get to it! Service is friendly, what you'd come to expect on a Friday evening in a hip-happenin joint such as the District, polite yet impersonal due to the volume of tables each server has in their stations. 

Grilled artichoke with BBQ sauce..mmm! Extremely flavorful but it's a rare feet for Lucille's to ever cook the artichoke JUST right, it was a little on the tough side. It went down the hatch though, no problem. 

Now, I know Lucille's is a BBQ place and when you think BBQ, you think big meaty ribs, pork, pork, chicken, meat, carbs and more pork but my most prized pick on this menu is actually their veggie burger! 

I'm not kidding when I say I have day dreams of this veggie packed faux meat patty and it's accomplice's, the grilled onions, spring lettuce mix, garlic mayo and of course cheese.. If that doesn't fill you up, be sure to indulge on their tasty yet far from healthy side dishes.. collared greens, sweet potato fries, BBQ baked beans.. the list goes on. 

So clear your dining calendar for a about a week and get ready for a fatty feast and a half. According to my more experimental friends, the catfish (blackened) was delish and the ribs were tender and cooked just right. 

NOTE: Drop cloth and elastic waist band a MUST to eat here"}
{"text":"First time at the red rock location. The food was delicious but the atmosphere not so much. The closer you are seated to the casino the more cigarette smoke there is. The Henderson location is more fun southern like. We had drinks, ribs, pulled pork and a burger and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"Less than five miles from the Strip is Green Valley and a selection of very good restaurants.  During a trade show we needed a casual place for a cold beer and some food.  Lucille's filled the bill.  Now, you will not think that you died and went to New Orleans - but for southern food in the desert southwest this is OK."}
{"text":"i was first introduced to lucilles in LA - but was pleasantly surprised when it found its way to las vegas.

i wont lie, ive sampled bbq from TX to TN to MS to SC to MO and back again. but the ribs at lucilles are pretty dang good. just recently a friend and i both ordered a full slab each, and we tried to have a rib eating contest amongst ourselves. the ribs were so good, that he and i both were winners regardless... but the portions were so huge - both he and i nearly died / overdosed on baby back goodness.

they have a variety of their house blend bbq sauces on the table for you to slather on your bbq - my favorite being the spicy one.

on a different occasion, ive had their mardi gras chicken dish - outstanding cajun flavors: chicken, shrimp, andoille sasuage and veggies over rice... ive also had their mixed meat plate: with ribs and hot link - i was surprised you get the whole hot link, uncut - extra bonus on how much meal you get for your money - 

in my opinion, this probably goes down as the best bbq in vegas.

not quite 5 stars, as i thought the service was trying to keep up instead of being on point... in their defense it is busy there, but for all 5 stars - this would have to be exceptional at all levels... service was just ok."}
{"text":"If you're craving BBQ, come here!  They even serve drinks in cute mason jars.  I'm from the south so I love the southern charm :)"}
{"text":"Love this food and the portions are huge. Sweet tea and corn bread is the best. Nice casual and comfy atmosphere."}
{"text":"First off, the service is great, our server Miles is awesome and super friendly.
The evening started out a little slow, but once our server got to us (he had a large 7 top so he was busy) we were going full speed. Even the other servers that were just passing by were super attentive. Making sure we had been helped while we were waiting for our drinks.
Boyfriend had the speciality old fashioned and it was tasty, I got the cucumber gimlet, not as strong as I had hoped but still very smooth, tasty and easy to drink.
We tried the appetizer sample and everything on it was super tasty. Then he had a wedge salad and I have a cup of their corn chowder. So goooood.
For the entrée he had the Mardi Gras chicken and I had the Louisiana pasta both of these were great!
Couldn't finish our food so we got the rest Togo and then ordered another round of drinks.
Had a gin martini and it was spot on. Ordered the s'mores pudding for dessert to split. Also great.
I don't have one bad thing to say about this place. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue!  nice lunch selection.  Loved my Louisiana pasta.  Lots of mushrooms with sort of a spicy gumbo sauce over penne pasta...pretty yummy.  Located in a really good area with lots of fun family activities close.  Lots to do.  nice service.   highly recommend"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Brandon was our server and was very attentive. I had the steak wedge salad, my niece had the kids cheese burger (a little too big for a kid imo) it was more if an adult serving. My husband had bbq tri tip. It was delish. The watermelon margarita was sooo good. We will definitely revisit in the near future"}
{"text":"Lucille's is the perfect southern comfort food restaurant. 
I've been to both this location and the Green Valley location. Obviously the Green Valley location has been around a longer and has service down pat. This Red Rock location is still working on things, but they're not doing too bad. 
The portion sizes are huge, so you can easily share a two meat dish with someone. You both will need to be extremely hungry to finish it. My favorite dishes are the southern fried chicken and the brisket. My favorite sides include mashed potatoes and cole slaw. And you can't go wrong with fried pickles as an appetizer.
Want a cocktail? Those are also delish!"}
{"text":"As I sat down to order food with my girlfriend I saw an ant crawling on my menu . My girl sat the menu aside and then her shoulder started itching to find 2 to 3 more ants crawling on her shoulder. Trying not to cause a scene we sat down and flicked ants off of her shoulder. My girlfriend stood up and got a waiter and the booth we were sitting in had 6-8 ants crawling on it. 

Can somebody please ask me if a manager EVER came to address the situation ? NO.... But of course who got the straight and narrow check at the end of it? THIS GUY"}
{"text":"I honestly didn't think I'd ever get good BBQ outside of Kansas City, Memphis or Austin. However, i ordered the Beef Ribs and Pulled Pork combo platter, and was quite surprised. They served the enormous plate with three totally different styles of sauce that covered every style..."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place in Vegas. Might not be saying much - but the Baby Back Ribs here are awesome! 

The biscuit with apple Cinnamon butter is awesome!

Definitely my go to when I want BBQ and to grub on some huge portions!

Also a great spot to pick up for lunches or office visits for work."}
{"text":"Burger was delicious!!! Loved the sauces!! Service was decent, the waitress made me laugh. The apple butter that came with the bread was so damn good!!! I wish I could buy it in the store! The restaurant was clean and I liked the decor. I'd come back, I was satisfied. I even had leftovers!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away and greeted well!! The restaurant is really nice, as well as the ambient view of outside! Chante was an amazing server!!! She was really great with suggestions and made us feel welcomed! Our food was delicious! The onion strings appetizer was so good!!! There was another waiter who was helpful as well! We were really satisfied with everything and we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Too normal food, nothing special, if I have to compare this place with someone else, I will say Dennys. Food expensive, no taste, just normal Denny's with a bigger price tag! Not recommend this place.
What I order was pasta with chicken, prego sauce (way generic), pasta over cook, no fresh parmesan cheese as stipulated on the menu."}
{"text":"Parking was a nightmare and they ended up seating us 20 minutes after our reservation time but the place was hoping so that was understandable.  Once we were seated the service was excellent and the food came out in a timely fashion.

Started out with the grilled artichoke and fried pickles appetizers...both excellent.  Particularly the pickles.  I had the tri-tip sandwich with side of beans and my wife had the half chicken with veggies.  All the food was well prepared and delicious.  

Definitely recommend over Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"Disgusting food! Everything they served was either way over cooked or way under cooked.  Biscuits were old and stale and tasted like yesterday's batch. The Brisket was like shoe leather and tasted like they were leftovers that was microwaved.  When I filled out the comment card and told them of our experience, they just added my info to their mailing list for advertisements. I was never contacted about our experience."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is being able to sit outside and enjoy great BBQ food. I had an original BBQ pulled pork, while my girl had the bacon cheeseburger. Neither of us could finish the food as they were pretty large portions, but we didn't leave overstuffed either. In regards to service, I can't say anything negative. Some of the best service we had in Vegas. 

Overall, not the best BBQ I've had, but still great. What we did think was amazing was their lemonades. $4/$5 each with fee refills and worth it. And again, the service sticks out.

Recommended? YES"}
{"text":"Pretty good for your money's worth...
Drinks are good and you end up taking home a doggy bag...they have a cute bday cake for celebrations and great appetizers...family friendly no worries they have the typical kids menu it's doable enjoy...party of 5 less then 100.00"}
{"text":"I went to have dinner today and my family and I had no problems. My rating has moved from 3 to 4. Keep it up Lucille's and you'll have 5 from me in no time!"}
{"text":"The brisket and rib tips are all i have had, both both were great after I sauced them. They have a great happy hour till 7 and $4 wells and Jim Beam is there well whisky! The happy hour app specials are very good, and especially enjoyable while listening to some live blues band on a Saturday night. I love the Southern atmosphere and the porch area they have a bit past the bar. Oh, and their apple biscuits are amazing. With some whipped butter, they are basically a dessert. My only recommendation will be to make sure you have a wheelchair to be rolled out in since you'll be eating up some very hearty bbq!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to try this restaurant and celebrated my birthday here. It was an ok bbq but awesome bisquits and apple butter. Just go to Bobby Q and you'll have the best bbq in the valley."}
{"text":"We love this place! Warm biscuits, cinnamon butter, great meats, and BBQ sauce...warm wet towels for cleaning up. Not the fastest service in town but made up for in food (and the kids menu had lots of good choices too)"}
{"text":"As always, enjoyed my lunch at Lucille's in the Tempe Marketplace.   My server, McKenzi, was awesome.  I'll be back for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Why hasn't anyone told me about these biscuits with apple butter?  Wow! I could have stopped there and been perfectly satisfied. 

I had lunch here a few years back and I don't remember loving it as much as I did tonight. After enjoying the biscuits, my wife and I split a half order of onion straws. They were seasoned perfectly and were piled high (we couldn't even finish the half order).  I enjoyed mine with the spicy table side BBQ sauce, whereas my wife opted for the sweeter original sauce.

For dinner, I ordered the 1/3 pound  BBQ bacon burger with shoestring fries. I was already stuffed before my dinner arrived, but decided to put my big boy pants on and eat up. My wife ordered the tri-tip sandwich and was in heaven. We enjoyed our dinner so much, she couldn't stop smiling and I couldn't stop nodding in acceptance. As if we weren't fat enough, we opted for the small banana pudding for dessert. Who doesn't have room for pudding? 

Bottom line, I regret not coming back sooner than I did. This place is great! 

****** They keep the air conditioning on full-blast, you would be wise to bring a sweatshirt or light jacket."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is delicious and there are three kinds of barbecue sauce to pour on top. And lucky for me, the gluten-free menu is lengthier than most restaurants. The wait can be long if you come on a weekend night, but give them your number and you'll get a text when they're ready. Or better yet make a reservation. You inhale a lot of second hand smoke if they seat you near the casino side. That's my one complaint. But the other side smells like barbecue heaven. We love the BBQ Two Meat Combo Platter: tri tip and pulled pork."}
{"text":"One star for the food but five stars for their red velvet cake! We got the BBQ chicken salad and the brisket salad and we sent them both back. They just didn't taste right and the brisket was tough. We will go back, though, but just for the cake.

Also have to mention that our waitress kind of had an attitude after we returned the food and when she asked how we liked the cake and we said how great it was, she replied, \"well I'm glad there was something you liked!\" It came across snotty and a bit facetious. Not good!"}
{"text":"So this is a two part review...

Part 1 - It's 115 degrees outside. It's a Tuesday. A group of us are trying to stop in for a quick bite to eat and to make it to GVR for $6 Tuesday Movies. So we chose Lucille's because a friend in the group had never eaten there and he wanted to try it. It was pretty steady for a Tuesday so we chose to sit in the bar. Reminder, hell's doors must have been left open because it was at least 127 degrees outside. So we're hoping to get in somewhere cool, enjoy a quickish meal, and go to the movie. As we take our seat in the bar we realize it's not cooling down. We get our drinks, they had more sweat coming off them than an Olympic weight lifter. Again, it's at least 134 degrees outside. So we order our food, definitely decent quality. Never had tried the burger so I got that. Also tried Fried Green Tomatos for the first time. Not too shabby. We tell the waitress that we need the bill because we're in a hurry to get out of there so we can make it to the movie. 10 minutes later she brings the bill. So I was already hot, since it was 140 degrees outside, this just made me hotter. Fortunately we made the movie before the start, but had to sit in the 3rd row (lame sauce). 

Intermission - so I wrote a letter on the Lucille's website just letting them know my disappointment in the service and the setting. I received a phone call from the restaurant manager and was told that because of their smokers they use when it gets above 110 outside they have a challenge keeping the venue cool. I appreciated the call and accepted the apology. Not very often you get an actual person to call you. Definitely won me over as I know this wasn't the \"norm\" for Lucille's. To my delight, a week later I also received a $25 gift card in the mail. Thank you Lucille's.

Part 2 - A perfect meal. This time it was only 104 outside (only, haha). I ordered my personal favorite, the Marinated Sirloin Steak Sandwich, and it was outstanding as always. Steak cooked to perfection. My wife ordered a bowl of clam chowder which she said was absolutely delicious. I'd be remiss to not mention the sweet tea, which I think I may have drank a gallon of. Best sweet tea around. Service was great, and the temperature was much more comfortable this time around.

Thank you Lucille's for turning a bad experience into a good one. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas/Henderson. The baked beans are delicious, and the ribs are to die for. The Henderson location is clean and friendly, in a great, safe location within walking distance to a couple fun pubs."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here tonight. My wife and I shared a meal and had leftovers to take home. Place was packed with a lot of smiling faces. Food and service were great as usual.
We will be going back as Red Rock Casino is a fav of ours"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and overall great BBQ. Being from the South I was a little hesitant to try a BBQ place in Phoenix, but I was glad I gave it a shot. I had the BBQ chips with a side a ranch to start with and for my main course I had the back porch with Ribs, Chicken & Tri Tip Platter, which were fantastic. I would recommend the place to anyone visiting the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Love the food!!! I had to take my leftovers home I could not finish my plate nor drink! Highly recommend it. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I am fan of the pulled pork sliders and the biscuits with honey butter.  The service has never really been good and they are not very accommodating.  Let me explain a little... like I said I like the pulled pork sliders... they come with 3 sliders and a side.  I asked if i could get 2 pulled pork and one beef brisket slider??? That was a big fat NO!  Strange since they are the same price.  They like to stay strict with that menu:).  I have definitely had better bbq other places."}
{"text":"Best bbq ever i love this place so much. The food is amazing and so is the service here. Been here twice and our food is always delicious and the service is great."}
{"text":"Skip this one!
Went for lunch. Service was terrible, food wasn't any better. Burnt ends were tough and Mac and Cheese was bad as well"}
{"text":"I just moved into the Gainey Ranch area and have been checking out my surroundings.  I was having a hankering for some BBQ so I \"Yelped\" it and found Lucille's.  I am very glad I went.  The service was prompt and very polite; the space was large, clean and appropriate; the menu is huge and most importantly the food was excellent.  I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"The best thing on menu is what everyone talks about at this place the Tri-tip. Had rack of ribs and they we ok, not great, but good. It was Father's Day when I had them so I cut them some slack they were probably overloaded that day. Nice touch though they gave all Fathers a $10 gift card for coming in. The Strawberry Lemonade is awesome. Loved the macaroni and cheese side. Most restaurants do it poorly this was real mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Not really that good!! Biscuits were horrible and the food took a while and came out dried out!  Got the Burtend Salad and I got six cubes of meat...paid $14 for a bowl of ok lettuce.....not good. Food is blah and way over priced!!"}
{"text":"Good waiting staff, mediocre food. 
Nachos 3/5
Sausage trio 1/5
BBQ chicken sandwich 3/5
Pulled pork 2/5
Tri-tip 2/5

Long wait for food that's a little below normal in quality. Portions are all out of whack also. Good sized portion for the fried pickles (5/5, those are amazing), small portion for fried tomatoes (1/5, very bland). BBQ overall was very, very plain and bland. And the \"hot\" bbq sauce has zero heat to it.

I guess its ok for a BBQ joint in AZ. I won't be back. 

PS - not a bbq aficionado,  but i know good food,  this isn't it,  look for another place for your bbq"}
{"text":"Talk about amazing BBQ! I am sad I waited this long to go to Lucille's. Great atmosphere, friendly/helpful staff, delicious BBQ, big portions, some of the greatest food I've eaten at any restaurant. I ate the beef ribs. They were perfectly smoked and prepared. I didn't need to add any BBQ sauce, but I did anyway. I tried the original BBQ sitting on the table and loved it. I had the Mac and cheese and BBQ beans as my sides.  The Mac and cheese was so creamy and stingy. The mix of spicy Nd sweet in the BBQ beans added a great flavor to the side. My boyfriend had the fried chicken which was perfectly breaded, well seasoned and the chicken was very juicy.  We are instant fans of Lucille's and are already plotting our next trip back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. .  Dried out Brisket. .
Just very disappointed .
Waited 25 minutes for a drink.  
And when our food came out. It wasn't what we Ordered."}
{"text":"Awesome food and EVERY employee was really friendly. Cody was our server and he was constantly on it with the refills and very friendly with a good sense of humor. The food was awesome, place was clean and he was the best server we have had in a long time. Helpful but not checking on us every two minutes."}
{"text":"Amazing BbQ place. Their biscuit is amazing, unlimited refill. Place is big, reservation is a good idea unless you want to wait for 40 min. Experience was different for different servers. Ill ask for Art next time. Brisket is amazing, chicken is so soft, and pork are great. Anything you order, it will be good."}
{"text":"First visit we ended up leaving because what was supposed to be a 10 minute wait turned into a 30 minute wait and we had a show to get to....but I'm SO glad we went back another time.

Food portions are HUGE so don't be shy about sharing a meal or even just an appetizer cuz DAH-YUM you get a lot of food. Love the drinks in mason jars too. Now that's the right way to drink sweet tea!

And the food was excellent. In fact, the biscuits and apple butter could easily be dessert...or a meal on their own. WOW. Super yum! 

Our server Bethany was terrific. She kept our drinks full, was very personable, and had great suggestions without being intrusive. I will definitely be back--and am looking forward to those biscuits and apple butter very soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves more than two reviews -- it deserves thousands, all raves.  We have been coming here practically since the first day it opened.  We bring all our friends here and it is the first place they want to go to when they come back to visit again.

You can smell the smoky goodness from the parking lot and the taste of the ribs is even better.  I have been a die hard pork rib lover for many years, but I have to say that the Beef Ribs (also known as Beef Candy in our house) are in another category of superb.  But wait -- there is more.  Although it may be hard to pass up the ribs, I often do, in favor of the gumbo -- rich with roux, smokey with chicken and sausage and sweet with rock shrimp.  And my husband will come just for the greens and grits, though I prefer the crisp fries and the creamy garlic mashed spuds.  Don't worry about filling up on the tasty appetizers and entrees, the desserts are less than stellar.

If you have a craving for tender smoked meat with a variety of sauces you will be totally satisfied at Lucille's."}
{"text":"Excellent service from the extremely friendly staff. I had a Crocodile Cocktail from the Happy Hour menu, along with the fried green tomatoes.  Delicious!  Triple tips with grits, greens and mashed potatoes means I have plenty to feed my husband when he gets home from work!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 10 for our NYE dinner.  They told us the wait was 45 minutes but sat us in 25. They had a live band and our server was on top of everything.  The food came off pretty fast but or server made sure to check on us often.  Bar mix drinks were delicious and they weren't water down like many places.  I would definitely recommend this pace to anyone."}
{"text":"Lucille's always has great food. I have gone there over a dozen times and the service along with the food has always surpassed expectations. I would recommend the BBQ Shrimp or the BBQ Bacon and Cheeseburger. Along with their watermelon tea. I recommend this place all the time!"}
{"text":"The brisket is melt in your mouth delicious. Come with a gorgeous smoked pink ring and boy do you fall in love at the first bit. The complimentary biscuits and apple butter start your meal off just right. All the sides are fantastic, but I'm a big fan of the Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Easily the best BBQ place in Henderson.  Prices are decent and quality of meats and their preparation is better than Memphis and Famous Dave's.  if it was only ribs I was after, I'd probably stick to Claim Jumper, but for all else BBQ Lucille's is the go to place."}
{"text":"We were pretty disappointed with the quality of the food at this place. The pulled pork was good, the mashed potatoes were good, everything TASTED good. But it was COLD! Even after telling them, they were quick to remedy it and bring us out a \"fresh\" batch... Which was also COLD! Lol..

My wife got the baby back ribs, and they were pretty tough, but the sauce was good. Her mashed potatoes and veggies were also COLD.

After them bringing out a \"fresh\" plate the second time and it being just as cold, we just decided to eat it, since we were pressed for time. For the price you pay, it is simply not worth it.

Not bad tasting, the service was great, the staff was friendly, and it was clean inside. But unless you like cold food, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend last week and had a not so great experience. I'm only giving two stars because the happy hour food we had and BBQ sauce was the only thing that was even good we ordered at least 5 things but the pulled pork fries could of been better if they didn't just melt cheese on top and actually used a cheese sauce... Out of the many workers there were  they passed by us without checking on us when we needed a refill for our drinks. The beer my man had got was very sour which hurt his stomach. It was our first time and we defiantly won't be back. Maybe just to buy the  BBQ sauce we used for the steaks we made days later. But I couldn't believe it my boyfriend and I are foodies we love trying new spots and have received many different forms of customer service and this has to be the worst we have ever had. Very disappointed as I've heard many great things from co workers and friends. ."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. Amazing service. If you're in the area don't miss this. Biscuits and apple butter. Tri-tip. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good food and good service. I found a say I had both today at this Lucille's. Bobby was a good server and the food was good. When you walk in you can smell the smoker going. I've been vegan slash vegetarian for a while now but decided it was a little time to cheat. Just a little. I did have some meat on my nachos. So again let's start with walking in. What place is super clean and they greet you with a smile and sit you pretty quickly. You can smell the aroma of the smoker cooking which kicks in your senses right away. Smart move on that one Lucille's. You sit down in your server comes right over and start you off with your drinks. Friendly nice and quick. Can't beat that. I ordered the half onion rings and half fried pickles with the brisket nachos. My wifey got the burnt end salad. Price was super good and they give you a ton of food. Even the half onion rings were piled high. The nachos were huge and oh so good. Everything hit the spot just right and had plenty left over for dinner later on. Keep up the good work Lucille's! I will definitely be back. By the way Bobby was a GREAT server!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this experience was a total disappointment, with the exception of the service which was good.  Went for a late lunch, two for one special.  You can only order from one section of the lunch menu and the selections are limited.  The portions are extremely small, food was barely
edible, slightly cold.  A quarter chicken should be more than just a leg.  You get one biscuit and if you ask for more, you get one.

The restaurant is never busy, even for happy hour, which has been going downhill for awhile."}
{"text":"Food was good.  The biscuits were excellent.  The fried pickles were good, but very hot (temp).  The jambalaya excellently plated, delicious and spicy.

The mint juleps were great.

The service was rushed, not sure why.  It wasn't crowded. The waitress asked for a second round of drinks before we were half way done with the first. She cleared plates and brought the desert menu before I was done eating."}
{"text":"Ok.    I really like this place.   They know southern bbq well!   It is way out at Red Rock Casino but I find it to be worth the drive.   Highly recommend.   Price is my only complaint or it would get 5 stars.   I always leave fat and happy though."}
{"text":"I'd been craving BBQ since I knew the Carnie Crew was gearing up for a field trip, and the last place I would've guessed that had it was Vegas.  Technically, this is Henderson, but it's about 10 min east of the airport.  

Located in what seems like a fairly new outdoor shopping area, Lucille's is huge and service is absolutely top notch.  The portions looked huge, so come with an appetite.

I ordered a bowl of the gumbo, which had a nice, smoky roux.  The roux is usually the tell-tale sign of a good gumbo, and while it was not down-home, hole in the wall NOLA good, it was unexpectedly great.  I enjoyed it and found the ratio of shrimp, chicken and sausage to be more than adequate.  The gumbo is served over a bed of rice, so it's almost a meal in itself.  For a Yelper, though?  BRING MORE FOOD!  So, with that, I ordered the Tri Tip Plate from the kids menu, which comes with a side of fries and mac & cheese.  I stuck with the meat, which was tender, moist, and nicely smoked.  

Great place for two or groups and parking wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ - but the service ruined my only experience here. Took 15 minutes to seat us when we had reservations!! Got seated, not that busy inside! Took 45 minutes to get our food, asked for a manager but never saw one. Took forever to get our check, asked if we wanted dessert - said \"no way we have time for that\"! Crying shame that such good BBQ was paired up with shameful service. Everyone inside the place was grumbling!"}
{"text":"BBQ is my weakness. My family thought I was crazy for wanting BBQ catered at my wedding. I'm proud to say that my ivory wedding dress did not get one drop of BBQ sauce on it.

The last time we visited this Lucille's location, it was an early afternoon and we were seated quickly. Our waitress, Typhanie, was very attentive. I had completely forgotten about those soft, pillowy little pieces of heaven called biscuits with apple butter. She apologized for the biscuits being so late to arrive to our table. I hadn't noticed, as I was still deciding what I wanted to eat. It's a hard decision there when everything is good!

I decided on the pulled sliders-two pork and one chicken. Ate those up quickly while sipping my half sweet/half non sweet tea in my favorite-MASON JARS! Totally gives that southern feel to the place.

Typhanie once again comes to our table and apologizes for the delay in the arrival of my husband's beer. Once again I am clueless as I am now browsing the dessert menu. Typhanie offers a free dessert for the lack of service, but we are so full and oblivious to the supposed lack of service that we politely decline.

It's been a long time since we've had a waitress THIS good, to accompany food THIS good.

Bravo, you little southern feel, southern cali restaurant chain! You hire great employees, and serve up some good cookin!"}
{"text":"Heard good reviews about this place but it was an OK experience for me. The food is actually good, but It took a while before we got our orders and got me a bit grumpy cause I was starving."}
{"text":"Food is good. Old school theme.. T
Its a restaurant -Bar..  Good place to watch game and enjoy meal. Very casual."}
{"text":"I love this place. Huge portions and decently priced.  Strawberry lemonades and Sweet tea both are pretty awesome.   Yum!"}
{"text":"My first visit to Lucille's was just OK. I didn't find anything special about the biscuits and butter spread. I ordered Fried chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese. The chicken was fried hard and a bit too salty for me. The mashed potatoes were great and the macaroni and cheese was not good at all. No flavor and it was not baked like I'm used to having. The chicken was smothered in gravy which I didn't really enjoy. The highlight was the drink Cucumber Lemonade with Skyy Vodka and Cointreau. It was light and refreshing on a hot day. I can't promise I'll be back anytime soon but I'd be open to it only if someone else paid for it. Lol."}
{"text":"The service was definitely not the greatest. It was a friends surprise birthday dinner but they wouldn't seat us until everyone arrived so that was kinda ruined. It was a Monday night so they place was not busy, somehow from waiting to be seated and finally leaving after the bill we were there for 3.5 hours!!

They got three stars because they have fried pickles, and they're spears not slices, WINNING! I did have leftovers for 3 days, and they have tootsie pops on they way out. Not a total loss. Pretty pricey for the quality though."}
{"text":"Best fried pickles!!!

Love the watermelon tea!

Good is great and staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Mon-Fri 3-7pm and Daily 9pm-Close

Been here a few times for Happy Hour.  Food and drinks are always good.  Service could usually be better.  Their HH specials are $4.50-$8.00 for select beer, wine and cocktails.  They also have $1 off all other drinks.  HH app specials range from $3.99 to $9.99.  This visit we ordered Blazin Burnt Ends, BBQ Sausage Duo, Bacon Cheddar Mac & Cheese and Pulled Pork Queso Dip.  For drinks I had a Back Porch Strawberry Lemonade and Sweet Georgia Peach.  Hubby had his usual cider.  Food and drinks were on point as usual.  Def a good choice for Happy Hour in The District.  

It is self seating in the bar area so no need to waste time checking in with the hostess."}
{"text":"Happened to be  in the area and seeking something we hadn't tried before.
 Oh my! The amazing scent of smokehouse food just got us the second we walked in the door.
I had the Four alarm burger. Spicy as the name denotes. I added some of the hot BBQ sauce ( I like heat, can ya tell?!) Amazing.I rarely eat an entire burger and today I came very close.
My hubby had the Original pulled pork sandwich. Until today he claimed I made the best pulled pork ever. I have to admit, this one put mine to shame!  
Fresh salads. The tomato balsamic dressing is really delicious.
Great blues playing in the background. Staff friendly and attentive.
Margarita was good. Hubby really enjoyed the House Red ale.
Added this to the 'must visit at least once a month' places. Also the 'recommend to friends and family' list.
Savannah is a super server. Love her personality and attentiveness."}
{"text":"My review would be 2.5 but that seems unfair since my side of greens  was good.  That's where it ends for \"good\".  Baby back ribs were tough and didn't fall off the  bone.  Rather boring actually.  Fancy smoker does not equal the love that is needed to make good BBQ.  Rolls,- ok,  fried tomatoes - ok, fried pickles - ok, everything needed sauce for flavor.  Waitress was good but the food took forever to arrive and wasn't hot, barely warm upon arrival.  It's a chain restaurant...."}
{"text":"I enjoy The BBQ Rib Appetizer!  As long as you get the bread and butter, this could serve as a full meal for a light eater.  It is approximately $16."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a number of things here. I had ordered the tri tips , with truffle fries, and a second side which is currently eluding me. Regardless, it was all delicious. The tips were a bit dry, but the smoke was just right. We ordered the BBQ egg rolls as well, which were amazing. Though Lucille's was not a reference to BB Kings guitar, I would certainly go back. Everyone I ate with (party of 6), enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here. My family and I loved all the food that we ordered. The service was great and the server Sarah was on top of everything. We never had to ask for anything. She was very professional. The bill wasnt as bad as I thought it would be, but either way the food was great. We will definatly be back again."}
{"text":"There pretty decent for a franchise. The St. Louis ribs are nice and juicy. The rib tips are excellent. Had the steak salad last visit which was decent too. Service has improved. Still notice tons of empty tables while people wait in line to sit. Take out is very hit and miss. I suggest dining in if going"}
{"text":"Good food but over priced. And the service wasn't the best. It was actually rather horrible."}
{"text":"We got there a little before 6pm. There was a party of 6 people. We were told there was a 30 minute wait. We told the hostess we were willing to take the 1st available. We ended up waiting for 40 minutes for a table. We promptly order our beverage and immediately got our bread. We placed our order and dinner was out in less than 15 minutes. The dinner was good."}
{"text":"Mmmmm BBQ. And a banana strawberry shortcake to boot."}
{"text":"Excellent food.... But also excellent service.... Be sure to ask for Tanner's section because he delivers...great customer service......I will be back....for sure...."}
{"text":"Ok so Hefeiwezen was not so good, Golden ale about the same. Girls back porch lemonade was not strong at all... HOWEVER the wings are bomb, tastes smoked nice and fall off the bone. The front porch rib link and chicken dinner by god was amazing. Greens with Mac and cheese on the side with a banana pudding to end was a+ as well. COLTON great server request him he's just as good as the food."}
{"text":"First time here .....wow food was amazing! Service was excellent and great atmosphere. Definitely bring my family here next time."}
{"text":"Went in on a slow Wednesday night with a comp from the casino for $30. I'd never dined in here before so I didn't know what to expect. The atmosphere is acceptable, some cool artistic things around the restaurant but I didn't spend a lot of time looking at it. 
They bring sodas out in huge mason jars - which is perfect because I drink them very quickly. I ordered their signature soup, a corn chowder. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Seriously - best corn chowder ever. EVER. Perfect balance of sweet and salty, lots of veggies too. Server brought out some biscuits as well, and they were just okay, maybe a little dry but the sweet sugar butter they serve with it is yummy. 
For my entree I had the half chicken - served with 2 sides; I chose mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese, all of it was very good and the chicken was not dry at all, the skin was slightly crispy from the grill and had a very good BBQ sauce on it. All that for only $25 
Dessert looked good but I was far too full. 
Server was super nice, very attentive."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 or 3 times since the place opened.  I love good BBQ, but this place really doesn't do it for me.  To start they give you biscuits with a side of maple (I think) butter which is really very good.  Their ribs are ok and so is their chicken, but I think their brisket is no good at all.  I really really like their grits (probably because I've never really eaten them before).  I would much rather go to Famous Daves or Bobby Q's.  Lucille's portions are larger than the other places but so are the prices.  The service is always very friendly at Lucielle's but also very slow even when they are not too busy."}
{"text":"I am a big bbq fan and had enjoyed my first couple trips to Lucille's but, had an average experience on my birthday one year so it had been a while since I had been back to Lucille's especially since Rudy's has opened up. I came back on a business lunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The restaurant is comfortable with cool Blue's music. The wait staff is very friendly. The free biscuits with apple butter are always a treat. I ordered the baby back ribs with tri-tip lunch combo. The meat was flavorful and very tender.  The peanut slaw that I ordered to accompany it was non-traditional but super tasty. Overall they probably saved themselves and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Lucille's is always an awesome choice. Tonight a large group of myself and my friends came in with no reservation and were seated swiftly outside on the patio. Our server Brooke was wonderful to our group of 12 making our dinner an experience. She made sure that every person had the correct order and split checks accordingly quickly! Shoutout to her"}
{"text":"Other than the excessive use of plate decorating parsley, the jumbalaya was pretty good and our waitress Auctavia was great."}
{"text":"My husband and I went on Sunday afternoon. The waitress was quick,but not friendly. She brought out 2 biscuits and that was only after she asked us if we wanted any. We remember in the past being brought a basket of (4) biscuits, without us asking for them. 

On finishing my peach tea, I was asked by my waitress if I wanted a refill. I said, \"Yes,please\". She never returned with the tea. Three  other workers passed  by my table  and asked me,\"Would you care for another tea?\" Again, \"I said, \"Yes\". And again, NO ONE brought me a tea. A manager walked by my table to ask \"How's everything?\" I told her she was the 5th person who asked if I would like a tea refill and I still am waiting for the tea. She said she would take care of it. Still no tea! My waitress walked to our table, again asking if I would like a refill. I told her she was now #6 of people asking me, but still no tea. She said she would take care of it. She didn't. Then a blonde manager came to me and I told her, \"You are now the 7th person to ask me if I need a refill\". This manager spoke to the waitress and I FINALLY was given a refill of tea. 

I live in Green Valley and frequent many of the shops and restaurants there on a weekly basis. My husband and I are still annoyed at the poor service at Lucille's. I might also add that the carpet looked shabby. My husband told me that the ribs were not as tender as they used to be. My pulled pork sandwich was tender and tasty. The corn on the cob tasted mealy. For a restaurant in The District, it has become a Big Disappointment to me. I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"If I could just eat the biscuits and butter alone, I'd give it a 5! I realize that I\"m vegetarian, so can't eat most of the menu, but they did offer a veggie burger that I was super excited about. I was envisioning a smokey type flavor from being on the grill + their delicious bbq sauce and unfortunately it fell short of my expectations.  The texture was mushy and there really was no flavor.  The sweet potato fries though = bomb.com!"}
{"text":"Decided to give Lucille's a try after having previously decided on going to the Yardhouse for Xmas dinner.  We are glad we did.  They had just opened for lunch  so we were seated quickly.  Lucille's had some great lunch specials that grabbed my attention quickly.  The server Ricardo was very helpful in explaining the menu and a little about Lucille's showing us the smoker in the dining room and explaining some of the processes, the house made BBQ sauces. Ricardo even made some suggestions and I don't usually fall for these sales tactics but since he was being effective at his job and it was the holiday I went along with his recommendations.  In fact the service we received from Ricardo makes this a 5 star visit and most likely why we will be back.

To start we had the fried pickles with mustard sauce which came out from the kitchen quickly.  These pickle spears were huge.  I might get the half order next time because this was plenty of app to start.  Next they have these fresh made biscuits served with apple butter.  They tasted sugar crusted and were so light a flakey and hot out of the oven. Yum!

I decided on the combo platter with 3 Spare Ribs, Brisket Burnt Ends, and Pulled Pork and I chose the Mac n Cheese for my side.  No garnish of lettuce for this plating, They wanted to highlight the meat only.  The portions were good and definitely filling.  With everything else I had I did not even attempt to tackle the side.  The burnt ends were a little chewy, I think I was expecting a little more tenderness.  The pulled pork was shredded nicely and sauced appropriately.  I did need a slice of bread to go with these items but I decided on slapping the meat on one of the biscuits.  Spare Ribs were fall off the bone cooked to perfection.  ON each table they have 3 featured sauces for your taste bud tantalizing.  My favorite was the spicy. 

We also had the Garden burger which came out with a nice smokey flavor.  Ricardo came out and informed us of all the vegetarian options that Lucille's offer's and how they cane make many of their pasta dishes with out meat for those dietary needs.  

Overall great experience for our first Lucille's experience.  I have not someone been so accommodating at an eating establishment in a long time and Ricardo was rewarded nicely for it.  He set the bar pretty high for future visits and I hope we are not let down.  Thank You Ricardo. We will be back."}
{"text":"Service in this past year has declined. 
But i decided to try again the other day service in bar fast and my food was good.
I always eat in bar."}
{"text":"If you stick with the meats that come out of the smoker you'll be fine. 
However other items such as salads, Gumbo's or any kind of seafood will disappoint you.

Nevertheless service is always adequate and friendly"}
{"text":"We took the family to Lucille's over the weekend in an effort to satisfy a lingering BBQ craving.  Upon entering we enjoyed the pungent smoky/salty/sweet aromas of a mixture of meats that caused us to salivate like Pavlov's dogs.  After checking in with the hostess we were sat fairly quickly in one of the back room's booths.  We ordered a round of drinks (Blueberry Bliss Margaritas) and decided to start with the Fried Green Tomatoes and Roasted Artichokes however the server informed us that they were out of the artichokes.  For our main courses, we ordered the Beef Ribs, BBQ Sauteed Shrimp, Kid's Pizza and 2 orders of Mac N Cheese.  Our server was very nice and attentive throughout our meal.  The Fried Green Tomatoes came in a congealed red pepper sauce that was a pass, but the tomatoes themselves were sweet and tasty.  The beef ribs were incredibly fatty and charred with very little sauce.  The kids demolished the pizza and mac so those were the true winners of the meal.  Overall, I'm not sure I ordered the best tasting items on the menu so I'm going to chalk this up to me missing out on a potentially good meal."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service, not so. We had cocktails at the bar waiting for our table.  Great service. When we got to our table we had to waive our waitress down. Food took forever. She forgot my dressing. We asked another waiter , he forgot it too. To pay, we had to waive someone down. Also for V D no atmosphere, no roses or anything special."}
{"text":"I've tried every single thing on the menu and I love it all. Their burnt ends are so good and have such a good smokey flavor! I love their mac n cheese the most though. I could eat a whole bowl of it. The biscuits and apple butter are to die for! Their baby back ribs are my favorite ribs. Their thanksgiving specials are amazing as well. I haven't really tried their pasta plates but for meat, the pulled pork is my favorite. It has the most juice and flavor to me. The snickers pie is the dessert that you need to try coming here! They do catering and have two different kinds of family basket things."}
{"text":"A little more expensive than the other joints in town.   Ambience is good and so is the service.  The food falls a little short for me.  The warm biscuits are pretty good.  I found the pork in the pulled pork a little lacking in flavor and the brisket was uninspiring.  I was constantly using bbq sauce and I generally don't like to do that.    The hunt continues for good bbq in this town."}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday night, the wait time was minimal. The staff was friendly and helpful. The entrees came out as they should, well timed with our appetizer.
The burgers were done well, and tasty. 
My corn on the Cobb side was soggy, maybe not the best choice. 
I thought the portions were small for the price, a large group would be costly. 
The atmosphere was comfortable and clean, well lit and decorated."}
{"text":"I had the brisket and garlic mashed potatoes, both very good. Brisket comes with a tasty \"mop sauce\" and there are also 3 kinds of house BBQ sauce on the table. Tried some of hubby's sweet potato fries and they were delicately crispy and light. The complimentary biscuits that come with apple butter are to die for! We split the chocolate cake for dessert, very moist and decadent without 
 the frosting being sickly sweet. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my first visit but I anticipate coming back soon.  I have never been here before but was given a gift card for this establishment.  Today was busy; however, we were seated quickly and didn't have to wait long to begin our order.  I decided to try the Apple Martini, which was lovely! Next, I had the Corn Chowder soup which was off the chain good and then I ordered the bbq brisket sandwich, cole slaw and garlic mashed potatoes.  Everything was prepared just right and was extremely filling. Our waitress was very tentative to our questions and pleasant.  She was knowledgeable about the menu.  If you are in town or visiting, you should stop in at this location because I thoroughly enjoyed myself."}
{"text":"The food is delish, the service is great, the ambiance is awesome. I take one star off because they almost killed my husband with a dose of sodium to kill a horse, their collard greens were so salty, they were unedible. I'll skip the catfish next time, but the BBQ was succulent. Give it a go, just be careful with the collard :)"}
{"text":"I grew up on BBQ, so I have to get a monthly fix... 

I've been coming here since they opened. I have tried many things,
ribs - good, 
chicken - good, 
brisket - good..
 tri-tip - about as good as it gets! 

The tri-tip is tender with the best smoke flavor you will ever put into your mouth. 
If you want southern sides, I highly suggest the greens and sweet potatoes. 

I am disapointed that they don't offer fried okra as a side, only as an appetizer. It must be there way to upsale.. Fried okra is my favorite and you can only find it a few places in town. 

Service is pretty good. They forgot utensils this time and it took awhile after the food was served to grab them, other than that.. a good meal reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Had a good experience but don't think I would be back.  I love Little Miss BBQ and Rudy's way way more.

The service was very friendly and efficient. 

The biscuits with apple butter were yummy.  LOVED the watermelon iced tea.  I think that was my favorite part of the whole experience.  Had the tri tip dinner with garlic mashed potatoes and coleslaw.  The tri tip was not the best I'd ever had.  I was actually a bit disappointed.  The garlic mashed potatoes were so incredibly garlicy that I had to dip each bit into BBQ sauce to mask some of the strong garlic flavor.  It was fun to taste all the sauces though and enjoyed them all.  After that the coleslaw had zero flavor, none!

To full for dessert."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The service was good. The time wasn't to bad, being it was a Saturday night. Our waiter was Kevin, he was awesome. He really took care of all our needs. Me and the family will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times and I love the food....however....Mother's Day, I went here for lunch with my best friend was visiting from AZ.. There was a small bug crawling on my plate. I called the manager. They took the plate and came back, apologizing and saying how this has never happened and how their kitchen has double inspections and has won awards . They said that because of the Mother's Day rush, the kale garnish may not have been fully cleaned and they gave us our food free. They asked me if I wanted another plate, to which I replied NO. At that time I couldn't eat anything, let alone food from here. This was the second time I had dined here and I absolutely loved their food. Fast forward to July, I decided to try them again....I asked for NO GARNISH for the entire table....we dined without incident. I also took my daughter there in November . Fast forward to my fiance's birthday. I took him here for lunch. I only ate half of my sandwich and took the rest home for lunch the next day. After work I heated up the remainder of the sandwich, took one bite...chewed....took a second bite and bit into something hard....I pulled it out....it was a small piece of metal...Almost like a piece of paperclip. I quickly packed everything back up and drove to the restaurant. The manager said that they would have a look at everything and call me back. The called me back on Saturday with all the excitement because they REALIZED what the foreign object must be. It was a piece of metal from their fry basket. Yeah ok, I'm glad you figured out what it was...but uh.....So their \"fix\" if you will is to send me a gift card so that I could come back and dine on them for free.....EXCUSE ME? Uh, NOOOOOOOOOOOO. I will not be dining there EVER again."}
{"text":"I seriously thought this was going to be the best barbecue in the whole wide world, the way people used to talk about this place. Do I like it? Yes.  Do I love it? Not in love.

The food was good. The service was even better. Our server was the best! She explained the menu, came by with refills often, and got our food out in a reasonable time. The environment was nice as well. They took reservations and were very professional. The bathrooms were also very clean, which is a plus!

The ribs were the best thing on the menu. The half chicken was also very good. It was perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. The brisket and the pulled pork were just very plain to me. I've had it waaaaaay better at other barbecue restaurants around town. The greens were really good. The mac & cheese was just okay. The strawberry lemonade won't let you down.

I would recommend this place if you're craving some barbecue and are in the area. I don't know how much better it is than Famous Dave's. They each have their own positives and negatives, but I don't think Famous Dave's has greens as a side. Plus, the location is prime since it is in The District. You can go shopping at Charming Charlie afterwards!"}
{"text":"Knowing I was coming into the area I decided to look up a BBQ spot and stumbled across this wonderful place. The food is absolutely delicious and the service was great. The beef ribs were smoked to perfection, mashed potatoes were delicious and the mac & cheese complimented the meal. The ribs were fulfilling with a lot of meat on them. Whenever I'm here, I'm here!"}
{"text":"Lucille's is my favorite barbecue place in town.  When trying the rib tips and brisket burnt ends, I didn't add any bbq sauce since I thought they tasted great alone.  I love Lucille's onion straws, and I prefer the onion straws to most regular fried onion rings elsewhere since the breading actually stays on the onion when I am eating.  Although I've liked everything that I've tried here, my favorite dish is the Jambalaya.  I can seriously eat it everyday!  The prices are a little high but still reasonable for the portion sizes.  This place is definitely worth a first visit and many returns."}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent, but I wouldn't include it in my list of favorite barbecue joints.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac and cheese, both recommended by the server. The sandwich was unsauced, which gave me a chance to try the three sauces on the table. I wasn't a fan of the Memphis-style sauce, so I split the meat between the original and spicy sauces, both of which were good, but nothing special.

The meat was pretty good, but nothing I haven't had before. The mac and cheese was pretty cheesy, but if that's what they're calling their best side, then they need to give it a little more umph, maybe some bread crumbs, bacon, or something other than just plain macaroni with melted cheese on top.

For dessert I went with the Snickers pie, as recommended. I'd probably recommend this to be split among two people - this was a lot of ice cream. It was good and nicely presented, but I don't think I'd get that much again.

Overall, this was a reasonably good experience, but I don't know if it's worth the trip or the money."}
{"text":"We had such great service from Dana, the food and drinks for great at a good price"}
{"text":"Truly, the perfect summer food is BBQ and this restaurant did not disappoint.  My family came here for lunchtime and their lunch menu was decently priced for the amount of food we were about to eat.  Located right at The District next to Green Valley Resort casino, parking was easy and the location is not hard to find.  Inside there is a separate bar area as well as a section for booths/tables.  I believe there is happy hour options at the bar only.

We opted to share the BBQ Platter in the not crowded at all restaurant section.  A choice of baby back ribs or st. louis style spare ribs along with two choices of other meats including tri-tip, beef brisket burnt ends, a quarter chicken, sausage, etc.  We had the baby back ribs, brisket burnt ends and the quarter chicken.

The baby back ribs were pretty good.  Nice amount of meat to it which came off the bone fairly easily.  Good flavors enhanced by one of Lucille's 3 bbq sauces on the table.  The sauces were Memphis-style (tangy bbq), original (mild standard smoky bbq flavor)  and a hot bbq sauce (felt tobasco-sauce based).  

The burnt ends were cooked very well.  So moist, good amount of meat and just a very little amount of fat to just give it a flavorful bite.   

The quarter chicken (thigh and leg) was also cooked very well.  Not dry at all.   Tasty as chicken could be.    We also had potato salad as our side which was fine as far as potato salads go.

My daughter had the mac-n-cheese kid's meal with shoestring fries.   There are plenty of options for kid's meals here.  It's good to know there is an option for every picky kid out there.

We also had a strawberry lemonade.  All of their drinks come out in large mason jars.  Very cool to drink out of and I assume all should be happy because it means less time spent on things like refilling water and more time enjoying lunch/dinner.

Now let me end this review by actually talking about the starter complimentary biscuits.  Because wow, damn, so so good!  When it comes out, it doesn't look like much.  Biscuits with apple butter.   However..   Looks can be deceiving!  The biscuits were actually powdered with a bit of sugar and they were insanely soft and fluffy.  I really thought the biscuits would be \"meh\" just by looking at them.   However, that apple butter on those biscuits were heavenly.  We had them bring more.

The servers were friendly, quick, and attentive.  No complaints.  An overall good spot for lunch.  I would definitely try this out again when the BBQ crave returns!!"}
{"text":"Wrote a review couple months ago because the food was terrible... manage replied and offered a gift card to try again and still haven't received nothing ."}
{"text":"First time at Lucille's @ Red Rock. Great atmosphere, great service. The signature baby back ribs were perfect! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite chain restaurant, consistently great food and attentive service. If you like BBQ I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the casual atmosphere and easy access from the front parking lot of Red Rock. Ryan makes a great Long Island. The wings are super franglais tic! Happy hour drinks are really reasonable..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Lucille's for many years now. I've always considered them the best when it came to BBQ, especially baby back ribs. The atmosphere is really great, it has a southern down home feel.

However, overtime, the prices keep creeping up. I understand inflation, I understand prices increase, but right now Lucille's has reached the level of \"fine dining\".

The final straw was when I came in today and noticed the \"rib appetizer\" was removed from the menu. The rib appetizer was the last option to have an affordable meal. The appetizer was a half rack of ribs for $15.99. Get that, add a side and your are just above $20 (excluding drink). However they got wise to that option and your only option now is to get the half rack meal at $23.99.

Lunch for me today cost $60 (that included tip). This was ONE person mind you! Again I'm not a cheapskate. But this place is not one you could visit often, only special occasions. 

So I had to go two stars just because of value. I understand that BBQ isn't the cheapest to produce, but at this price I'd rather go to a steakhouse. BBQ should be something friends and family can enjoy often. For now I'm off to find another BBQ place to frequent, or just bust out my smoker and do it myself."}
{"text":"Definitely a chain and therefore variable. We have been to Lucille's other location in town a few times and its always hit or miss.  Here was no different.  
the service was attentive and good.  She kept our drinks full and brought us two baskets of biscuits as we had multiple kids at the table.  The mistake they made was bringing the adults meals prior to the kids meals.  They should have come out first or at least all together.  
The baby back ribs were good, fell off the bone so they were tender but they didn't pack much flavor.  The tri tip also was tender and lean this time and the sauce it came with was better than eating it with bbq sauce but again not a ton of flavor without the sauce.  The corn on the cob my friend got was juicy and good, the veggies another one got was seasoned well but my sweet potato (and i love sweet potatoes) was runny and bland.  
We were all too full for dessert........we would come back due to the convenient location but for bbq itself we would go elsewhere. The issue we had too was that happy hour was only at the bar, so if we came with the kids after school we would be able to have food but not participate in happy hour. when we asked about it too we were told definitely not. So we would just go next door where we all could enjoy happy hour."}
{"text":"Lucille's is a solid BBQ joint. They are based out of California, knowing so, you would not think they would throw down some great BBQ. Far from the truth, this place is great. Huge portions and some tasty Mac n Cheese. There are a small handful of decent chain BBQ joints and only a few mom and pops in the valley and Lucille's holds its own. If your near the 51 and indian school, Stacey's is a must!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from Lucille's a few times for lunch for my office. This place is definitely a great go-to BBQ spot if you're not in the mood for cooking your own BBQ.. But it's definitely not the \"home-cooked\" quality I would hope for.
The ribs are mediocre at best. The chicken is very juicy and very good. The burnt ends are awesome! Make sure to get a biscuit and spread some apple butter on it... DELISH! The banana pudding is AMAZING. My favorite dessert on the entire dessert menu.

I would definitely recommend for people to eat here. It's very good for the price you pay!"}
{"text":"On my third visit, I had gotten take out.  There wasn't anyone at the counter, but the girl finally came, although I wasn't ready to order yet.  She left and said to call her when I was ready to order.  I figured she would come back after a few minutes but she never came back so I had to ask the hostess to get her.  We finally ordered, the food took awhile and there seemed to be an issue with my gift card.  The manager came over, and was super polite and was able to show her how to ring up my order.  This was going to be the first time my husband has eaten Lucille's and he was not impressed at all.  I didn't enjoy my food as much either, but I figured it was because it wasn't piping hot from the oven by the time I got home.  I agree with other reviews that the food is pricey for what you get.  But, their lemonade still rocks and will be ordering that when I am in the area.  I think I will only dine in if I ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here one night during our vacation. Usually we tend to not eat out since we are visiting family. But we ate dinner here and they did a great job taking care of a party of 16 -- I mean really 16 people, that's a lot of us.
I had the Mardi Gras Chicken and it was amazing. I had some of their speciality drinks and those were awesome too. Hopefully, we can go again for next year's trip."}
{"text":"Wow won't take reservations for a party of 8 or more. After being on hold then transferred twice and then being told just to call 20 minutes before arriving to be put on a wait list. I'm not impressed with their customer service. Hey if u don't need my business I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We had an unforgettable experience at Lucille's last night. Had over 100 kids and parents from SJHHS Lacrosse for dinner. The staff was very attentive, friendly, fun and professional. Love the biscuits with sweet butter, brisket, ribs and more. We also celebrated Coach Albert's 40th Birthday! Thank you! ."}
{"text":"Finally found a place to have gumbo and Jambalaya... The search is over.  We took the kids there they have a nice kids menu.  I had pulled pork sandwich was very tasty.  My son loved the kids ribs.  Both the gumo and jambalaya was loved my my daughter and husband.  Looking forward to going back!!"}
{"text":"Listen closely, I am going to have to whisper this in your ear.... remember all the stuff about Rudy's BBQ, next in line this, n next in line that.... yada yada???? Well, I cheated. I went to Lucille's in Vegas. HOLY PETE! This is Texan style bbq= the real deal. Warm, moist fork tender brisket, sausages, ribs, steaks, even a lil chicken...I do not do fish, so did not even look to see if they serve it...ew. Rich tomato based BBQ sauce in the standard Texan rich and thick style, and they offer two others a spicy and a something or other= I was busy with the rich and thick.. Fresh made from scratch warm corn bread, real butter, real bbq beans, you know the kind with strips of beef in them.... sweet potato fries, reg fries, mashed taters, tater taters, garlic taters, crisp fresh salads, including tater,  real, home brewed tea- sweetened or not..... beer, wine,.... and a fabulous desert menu. Don't say you heard it from me, but schooch over Rudy's, mamas got a new bbq love! There are a couple of locations, I have only ever been to this one. It just occurred to me... I may be a bbq addict."}
{"text":"We've been drawn into eating at Lucille's countless times because of the amazing smells from it drifting throughout The District, but unfortunately the food rarely satisfies.

The best dish I've had here was a seafood risotto that was on special. There is nothing really wrong with any of the food. It's decent BBQ, and probably some of the best in Vegas, but I can't help but think there could be better."}
{"text":"Second visit here at Lucille's Red Rock and under awed with the cooking, again. 

First time here, a Saturday night, I had a dinner salad with tri tip and way too much long-sliced scallions (onion). Whole thing was drenched in dressing making it just taste bleh.  

This time was a Wednesday, lunch special (3pm), stuffed baked potato with beef. Way hard to cut potato even using a steak knife (no joke) and the beef was chewy / rubbery, even under melted cheese - they left potato on warmer / heat lamp too long. Also, way too much long-sliced scallions as garnish. Why not offer chives as an additional pay-for option?

Tried Lucille's beer sampler this time and only their version of wheat beer paired well with any of the food, in spite of what alcohol menu & server said. Three other samples (blonde, and ??) were each very bitter. 

Also, just an FYI, happy hour prices are only in the bar. They'd make more money if they allowed happy hour prices in the whole restaurant, like other Las Vegas chain restaurants. 

On positive note, the server apologized for both my kid's meals coming out ten minutes (not exaggerating) after my wife's & my plates. The fries had sat out too long & got soggy, so they had to fry up another batch.

I never make a fuss in a restaurant, as I've worked in the industry. I'll go back one more time, as my kids like the Mac & cheese here. We'll see how they do then.

Then, if no change, I'll just post on here and call their corporate number to check out the reviews. That'll shake up the kitchen staff and hopefully improve the quality.

By the way, I'm a huge fan of the Lucille's in Henderson. Thought all chain restaurants had the same cooking practices, food & standards?"}
{"text":"We finally tried the Red Rock location and we liked it.  There were big portions and I couldn't even finish my meal. We tried the Fried Dill pickles.  It was pretty good."}
{"text":"Lucille's cut their portions!! (See Photo Below!) It's been about 6 months since we last visited. This was by far the worst experience. My guess is that business has slowed so someone made the decision of cutting costs by cutting down on the portions. 

First off we were a party of three and they brought us only two biscuits. Could have been an honest mistake here but it didn't get any better when the food arrived. 

I ordered the two meat combo with tri tip and baby back ribs ($27.99). It comes with two side so I got the Mac n cheese and bake potato. When the food arrived I was shocked to see only 4 slices of tri tip and 5 baby back ribs! For $28 this is a pretty cabs deal! I usually get the two meat combo and i usually have leftovers to take home but not this time. I ended up eating the entire plate of food and was still hungry. Sadly this was the same experience the others in my party had. 

If you don't believe me, just look at the photos that people have posted 1-2years ago to today's photos. They even stop serving watermelon slices with their food. You have to order it as a side now! 

Anyways, a great BBQ place is now not so great. The food might still be good but it's no longer worth the value. $28 value to be exact."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. My sandwich was distasteful and dry, which I understand is a common problem with barbecue restaurants. I'd understand if this was a low-level hole in the wall but this place is well established. First time here and probably the last, only reason for the three stars is because the service was outstanding, otherwise, I would've giving a one star; save yourself and go to Rolling Smoke."}
{"text":"Good food, but portion sizes don't make much sense.  We ordered a half of the sampler appetizer, which was HUGE!  It was also very delicous.

We had also ordered a sandwich to share, and we were disappointed with the size of the sandwich.  Overall, everything tasted good, though nothing truly to write home about."}
{"text":"Love Lucille's but hadn't been there for awhile so decided to treat myself to some great ribs. Ordered one of my favorite drinks, \"sorry we are out\".  Ordered corn on the cob, \"sorry we are out\". Everything else was good but I guess it will be awhile before I go back. 

Went back again \"sorry we are out of corn\". 
Probably should take it off the menu."}
{"text":"not that great.. veneti salty and fatty.. it's definitely a 3 start joint compared to other places you could pick.. also for the quality the price was a bit up there.. I won't be back"}
{"text":"Basically an Applebee's, but that's not a dig. They have a large food and drink menu, lots of TVs, and a comfortable casual atmosphere. Most entrees run around $20. If you're in the Red Rock casino, this definitely beats eating something microwaved at the food court. The snickers ice cream pie is a very tasty dessert if you're still hungry after your meal."}
{"text":"There are so many wonderful things that I can say about this place! The food was amazing, the service was VERY good, and they probably have the very best peach lemonade that I have ever tasted anywhere! Great prices in my opinion for the quality of food that you receive and I will continue to go here as often as I can afford to!"}
{"text":"I enjyed the decor - made me feel like I was on the streets of New Orleans! A little cheesy, but hey, it looked nice! 

The babyback ribs were delicious, and the sauce was nice and sweet. However, whoever mans the kitchen is OBSESSED with sugar. Appetizer biscuits should NOT be sugar-coated. And I dont want to put super sweet apple butter on a sugary biscuit. I would have much preffered salty butter to balance the sweet biscuit. Or better yet, get that sugar off the bread! The baked beans were also so sweet that I could not eat them. One of the three BBQ sauces on the table was also waaaay too sweet.

Places like this are why Americans are fat...easy on the sugar please."}
{"text":"We just had Lucille's cater our Xmas party at our home. Ethan come to my home, he arrived early and set everything up. He was amazing!  I'm very picky about how I set things up for my parties and I think he did a better job than I would have done. He was so professional and polite. The food was GREAT and EVERYONE committed on how good it was. We had ribs, chicken, pulled pork, slaw, beans and apple cobbler. It was set up in chafing dishes and came with biscuits and honey butter, lollipops, salad and all the plates, bowls, utensils, napkins and toothpicks! This was our 4th annual Xmas party and by far my favorite food and catering job. Thanks Ethan and Lucille's!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, so happy to see that they're by the house now too! Food is good, and the lemonade is the best! Recommend this place for a \"quick\" bbq spot."}
{"text":"First decent BBQ I have found out here. Service at the bar was good, although the bar tender was convinced I have been there before and have a \"regular\" drink (first time here). I will definitely be back here again when work brings me back to the valley."}
{"text":"Yummy as always. We got the burnt ends -- an app of burnt/cooked and partially juicy ends of some kind of steak I am not an expert but it was good with a ranch dipping sauce. We each got the ribs you cannot go wrong with the ribs and I had a cup of soup + two non alcoholic tea's - cost $85 I like this place it's nice for a date because it's a tad noisy with a nice environment and a bar with sports on if you like. They also usually have live music at night and/or on weekends. Not sure if they take reservations/open table but if they do I suggest you do that - this place is usually crowded with indoor/outdoor and a screen fence dining areas. Lucille's is a nationwide chain."}
{"text":"I'm not a big \"yelper\" BUT I ordered this for delivery through uber eats so I've never seen the location or experienced any customer service... BUT WWWOWWWW! My whole family agrees that the food is insane! Every little thing in our order was like... \"oh my gosh... you HAVE to try this!\" Kinda food. I obsessively order out ALL the time cause we're super busy and this is one of the only meals I've had in such a long time that I can really say is very homemade tasting. It's not weird fancy with odd flavors... it's very old school \"grandma inspired cooking\" as long as it keeps tasting like this... I will be a very loyal long time customer"}
{"text":"First & foremost THE BUTTER!!!! Oh my! I could have really eaten it with a spoon & forget about the biscuit! 

There were 7 of us total which included 1 Vegan, we ordered 2 appetizers & the family meal to share & left with a ton of leftovers. Next time we may not do the appetizer platter which we only ordered the 1/2 plate cause by the time our meal came we were stuffed! Good food, loved the BBQ.

However, (there's always a \"however\") the service :-( our server kept forgetting everything we asked for. Seriously we had to ask twice or ask a different server. I was tempted to go get the water, plates, etc myself! For sure the next time I go, I may ask to sit at the station of the best server. I never mind leaving exceptional tip 20% & above if the service is 2 thumbs up. Don't get me wrong, we still tipped this guy very well but it was just because we felt sorry for him & my kids are in the food service industry. But my kids know how to give sincere excellent customer experience. 

Should I rate a 3-4? Food was awesome, service eh!?"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with a group of 9 of us, and let me tell you, it was one heck of a great decision! I had no idea this was a chain restaurant, but I did not get that feeling at all. It was a nice, clean restaurant with easy parking. The staff was very prompt and kind throughout the entire dinner. 

To begin, the server brought baskets of sweet biscuits with apple butter (unlimited quantity) and this was SOOOOO GOOD! We ordered the sweet tea and peach lemonade etc, all come in gigantic mason jars with unlimited refills, so definitely well worth your money. 

Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! The fried chicken, the chicken in some spicy sauce, brisket, catfish, RIBS! The baby back ribs were the best ribs I have ever had. The barbecue sauce was smoky, yet sweet--so so good! Each of the sides was delicious as well! We loved the mac and cheese, sweet potato fries, and garlic mashed potatoes. The serving sizes are gigantic and definitely large enough to share. 

The staff was very sweet and brought out a chocolate cupcake ice cream sandwich, topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream and sprinkles, with a candle for my birthday. And they brought hot towels for everyone at the end to clean their hands. 

If you sign up for Lucille's online club, you can get $5 off your bill. 

Very, very, very reasonable prices for such massive amounts of scrumptious food! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour last week. Looked it up and they had one of the best happy hours around so we decided to give it a chance. 

We got here around 930 and it was pretty packed. The waitress seemed to be slammed but being in the industry we were more than ok waiting.

We ordered a couple of drinks from the happy hour menu and decided to try the mac and Hesse, spicy bbq bites and the deviled eggs.

Let's start with the deviled eggs. Nothing amazing but well prepared and seasoned. The bacon on top truly sets it off. We gave these a steady 4/5. 

We had asked for water and some corn bread. Took nearly 30 minutes to get it. Every time our waitress looked at us she had the whole \"doooohhhh forgot to get that for you\" look on her face. Poor thing was really busy.

To it disappointment the bbq bites were just cut up chicken tenders. Sadly they were dry and only flavor on them was from the bbq sauce. Have to give these a 2/5. 

Lastly was the mac and cheese. It's a bacon cheddar mac so once again it's hard to screw up. The noodles seemed dry. Almost like they had made this batch way early in the day and it was just thrown into the the microwave. 

Drinks weren't bad for the price and neither was the food but overall stick to the regular menu and fork out the extra money for the babybacks."}
{"text":"Brisket showed up cold for the entire table.   Asked to see manager and he/she never came over.   Took  3 times asking for the check before we got it.   It is a shame as we go to the Henderson location all the time and have always had a good experience.   The server was ok but was very slow.  It took us almost 2 hours to eat from the time we sat down until we left.   Looks like we will stick with the east side Lucille's ."}
{"text":"Hubby has been dying to try this place and since it's his birthday he wanted to check it out. We called in around 1pm and set up a reservation just in case it was packed. Arrived and sat in the enclosed outside area. 

Our server was Travis. Nice but completely inattentive. Had to ask several times for refills, for extra dressing and yet when the server came around they would say they would bring that right out. We also informed that it was the hubby's birthday and no embarrassing act was performed. 

When we received all of our food, sides and drinks they alone were amazing! Everything tasted fantastic sadly their staff can't keep the same amazing level of service. We traveled from North Glendale to here and it isn't worth it to return if this type of service is given 

Family of 4. No appetizers. Cajun shrimp, grilled chicken salad, chicken fried steak dinner and a full rack of ribs=$130.00."}
{"text":"They shouldn't even get the star, but what the heck...it's the star that stands for stupid-terrible-assholes in restaurants. This place sucks!! Starting first with THE HOSTESS CANDACE who clearly doesn't know how to sit people accordingly. This is the same hostess I've read about in other reviews. Even if you make reservations she still manages to get it wrong. She will have you waiting for ever, so make sure to wake her up. She tends to fall into this I am so clueless kind of look( daydreaming). Not the brightest individual, clearly lacks common sense. But hey....what can you expect, it's CANDACE. 
    Oh and TOM the manager does not care one bit about his job. Lacks customer service BIG TIME!!! Don't even bother to tell him any bad situation you have encountered there. He might as well be known as CANDACE jr. He will look at you  and try to BS you with his awful explanations. I told TOM that I've been waiting for a table for a party of five. Which was suppose to be a 35 min wait. Turned out to be 1hr and 25min later. I asked him how hard is to accommodate 5 people here. He said that he didn't have anything available, yet as we are talking about this I see other parties of 4 go by and get seated. All of these parties came way after us being there. I told him I would call corporate and tell them the situation and that I would make sure to point him (TOM) and CANDACE out about how terrible and crappy their customer service is here. As soon as I said that, he then turned around like a little lost kid and all of a sudden there's a booth available. WOW!! Talk about getting caught in a lie, funny how they quickly changed as soon as I said I would be calling corporate. Which I still plan on doing! So thank you TOM-aka Candace jr. AND CANDACE FOR YOUR CRAPPY SERVICE WE HAD THERE AND FOR HELPING ME MAKE MY DECISION NOT TO COME BACK HERE AGAIN. Manager and the hostess here should get employee of the month for excellent crappy  service. Never once did he apologize about the inconvenience, but it's ok tho I believe in karma. Someone in a higher position will read this and it will come back haunt them. DON'T HURT THE BUSINESS JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT HAPPY THERE! It's individuals like you two that make individuals like me not want to come back here. I'll take my spendings elsewhere, plenty of other restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Our friend used to work here,so on a Vegas trip,we decided to stop in. The fried pickle spears are amazing. I had the pork ribs. They were sooooo good! The cheese grits have a smidge of jalapeño. They are so yummy too! Then I also had the honey toasted peanut coleslaw. Great service(we sat at the bar) great food. Huge place. Outside dining also also. Come eat here! It was our first time and I was impressed.COULDNT GET ANY BETTER,BUT THEY JUST BROUGHT WARM TOWELS TO CLEAN OFF MY BBQ HANDS!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar tonight for a change. Here is what I experienced-
No acknowledgment by bartender, had to flag down a waiter(there appeared to only be one bartender who was busy making drinks for the wait staff)
Drink order was taken by waiter (who was very kind and patient) who brought my drink complete with lip stick on the rim of the glass
However, bartender came and kindly fixed me up with another drink
Ordered Fried Green Tomatoes appetizer and bbq brisket sandwich
Sandwich came-but bartender forgot to order our appetizer
Bartender took appetizer off the bill.
Over all not bad."}
{"text":"New to Nevada- got seated in Sara, \"with the tattoos\" section as a previous reviewer had mentioned and we literally won the jackpot! Best server ever! She has the best sense of humor and best recommendations I'll eat here again just for her great ability to wait a table!"}
{"text":"First time here with a friend we were in mood of some good old fashion bbq. First off they give you these big biscuits with a sweet spread to go with it.  Let me tell you it was awesome! For an appetizer we had fried crispy spicy pickles. They were delicious and had a kick to them.  My friend ordered gumbo,  which came in a huge bowl with rice.  She said It was good.  The rue was darker than most gumbo I've had. I had the bbq chicken with burnt ends, rib tips, Mac n cheese,  and fries. I had both pieces of chicken quarter, it was more like I had half a chicken. I could've split the meal with the big portions I received. The Mac n cheese was okay. The drinks are served in big mason jars,  which gives you that country feeling. You can also take your drink to go in a large cup. The bill came to $50 for the two of us which wasn't bad at all I was expecting more. The staff is friendly and professional.  I'll be back try other food and drinks on the menu."}
{"text":"Seems like a chain restaurant trying to model itself as a cute Southern BBQ joint, which it is not. Yeah, they give you a big mason jar to drink out of and biscuits with apple butter to start off. I recognized the biscuit but couldn't figure out what the sparkly stuff was on it, which turned out to be sugar. At first I didn't know what the apple butter was. Even after eating it, I later asked the server what was in it. The biscuit was dry and the combo was not Southern style.

Lucilles has Tri-Tip all over their menu. That made me chuckle because if Southerners knew where Tri-Tip originated from, you'd probably get shot. Stick to your Santa Barbara roots Lucille.  

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and it was delicious!!! My server recommened the Memphis style BBQ sauce and he was right - an excellent combination with the pulled pork.  The fries were nothing to write home about. I would have wanted fried okra with my meal, but that option is only available as an appetizer and not a side order. WTF?

I went for the peach cobbler for desert. I couldn't tell it was made with peaches. It seemed like a sweetened mass with a crumbly topping. Good cobbler is not that hard to make, not sure why the follow through wasn't there. 

I wouldn't mind trying this place again. They smoke their own meats and they did well with my pulled pork. The rest of the meal was a little lacking. If the price for the main dishes weren't higher than giraffe tail, I'd come back again, but sorry Lucilles isn't on my return list.

The staff was friendly and I was able to get a weak wifi signal. Bathrooms were somewhat clean."}
{"text":"Food and service were awesome!! We had Beef Ribs macaroni n cheese and roasted corn. BIRTHDAY CAKE with Ice-cream. Austin H was our server. We will be back. ;)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. We used to travel far and wide to the green valley location but now they opened a new location at Red Rock Casino. 

The staff are incredibly nice and helpful. We came during lunch so they had lunch specials with the right portions for me. 

My favorite part of this place is their sweet tea that is not too overly sweet. And, their famous complementary biscuits and apple butter. I can eat those all day! 

They also have happy hour!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour here is great!

1. Smoked Spicy Sausages
2. Chicken here is juicy... even the breast!
3. The chili here is FANTASTIC! OH MAN! I LOVE IT!
4. Brisket is so soft, tender, and pieces come off when you use a spoon. 

You have to come here for the brisket and sausages at least. The atmosphere is like any other barbecue restaurant, but they have some incredible bbq sauces (the spicy one is my favorite). I highly recommend coming here for their happy hour to get a little bit of everything. They also accommodate couples with their plates that can be shared (I bet two individuals will be satisfied)."}
{"text":"holy moly.this place is gooooooooooooooooooood.im a bbq snob.i like to think,and this place takes the cake.plenty of  sauce choices.the serving portions are huge.not even funny.they offer plenty of different ways to get your meat cooked and seasoned.the mac and cheese is heaven.so cheesy twiced baked yummy goodness for your belly.the bbq chicken is mouth watering and im picky about that dish,usually you get it dry from other places.open till 10 so perfect for my late schedule.if i ate there evry night id be a large loveeee man,so i space my visits out....go get qued now"}
{"text":"Told 30-35 min and have been waiting over an hour now.. So disappointing.  Had we known it would have taken so long.. We would have gone elsewhere.. This place came highly recommended... So the food will hopefully overcome the poor service... (Originally based on the wait promised when we first arrived- I gave them one star)

But here is my update based on the rest of the evening.

I wanted to revise my review based on the great service provided by our server, Tanner. I'd give him a 5 stars for his patience alone... He did an amazing job accommodating our very large party of 16.  He was genuine, friendly, and very knowledgeable of the menu choices.

Earlier in the day, my cousin tried to make a reservation.  She was told that they were unable to do a reservation.  However, after finally being seated, I noticed 2 of the booths adjacent to our large table had \"Reserved\" signs... Hmmm... Conflicting story..
 
My husband and I arrived at 5:25pm.  We put our name down (as the rest of our party was parking)  The hostess advised 30-35 minutes.  My husband and I ordered drinks and waited in the bar, and when the rest of our party walked in we went and sat in the parlor.  At no time were we given an update on status of our place in line.  After over an hour, I got up to check.  Still, not ready.  Then my cousin checked, followed by her sister.  She had noticed that a large party (appeared to be over 6 people got seated right away)  I finally got up and told the hostess that it was ridiculous that we had been waiting an hour and a half at that point.

With that being said... What my husband and I had I'd give it 4.5 stars, and I know others in our party loved the Ribs, and Chicken.  So based on our poor start to the evening averaged with the great server and the delicious huge portions of food... I'd give it a 3.5..."}
{"text":"Let's put it this way, I have never had a bad experience, nor a bad meal. We have been there about 8 times and each time we buy extra bottles of the hot BBQ sauce to take home. I even shipped some to my MIL in Detroit. I highly suggest the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich - and if you go at lunch you can get it for a few bucks cheaper. My husband always gets ribs and is never disappointed. The fried okra comes with a spicy sauce in which you will also want to dip your other foods. 

My kids always get the kids' chicken fingers and never have to take a bite home (which is unusual because they are such picky eaters). The biscuits with apple butter are one of the best items on the menu. I have also had the banana pudding which is delicious, but nothing special. I have had better from authentic Southern home cooks. You will leave having to unbutton your pants because you are so full. I highly suggest not eating for hours and hours before you go - you will want to indulge. 

Typically, we are seated right away. Only one time did we have to wait, but the restaurant is still full all the time. The prices are a bit high, but worth it."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE BBQ place in Las Vegas. The meat is juicy and the flavors are great!"}
{"text":"So this review started as 1 star but I have to rate Lucille at red rock 5 stars. What changed my mind is the manager Jeff, who cares about customer service. I went as a last minute decision with my children and grandchildren. 2 who are 1 and 1 who is 2. We checked in and was told by the hostess it would be 15 minutes,  then she said 25 minutes which would have been an acceptable wait time. But time passed and it was almost 40 minutes, the kids were getting antsy and hungry and the hostess had no idea of how much time to tell customers the wait is. Well after an hour, and much complaining, the manager Jeff stepped in, got a table together for us right away and gave us appetizers and kids meals . I'm glad we waited because our server was excellent, and the food was great! Thank you Jeff, we will be back with a reservation!"}
{"text":"The best bbq i've had hands down. My mother came into town to visit from Miami and I wanted to take her and her boyfriend to my favorite restaurant in town. They can't stop talking about how good the food was there. I personally go through about 3-4 Mason jars of the strawberry lemonade when i'm there. The atmosphere there is great, the design of the restaurant. 

I love this place!"}
{"text":"Girls' Dine Out!


I've been here once before and didn't think much of the overpriced BBQ that tasted more like Famous Dave's BBQ you pay less for.

It was picked by a unanimous vote by girlfriends who wanted to meet in the middle.  I have to admit that the service is not bad.  My sister and I shared a meat combo platter which consists of brisket, chicken and pulled pork.  There was a side of tasteless slaw and overcooked bacon collard greens.  I must admit that their white peach sangria was pretty good.  

It was okay.  I don't see myself returning here unless another democratic vote forces me to."}
{"text":"Service sucks tonight. Servers who brought are food gave attitude and never brought back our extra plates.  Walked off with the nose up in the air.   Baby backs where real dry."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try the fried green tomatoes. What a pricey disappointment. For $10 you get five slices of tasteless, mushy inside-burned outside tomatoes. The breading is very thick and there is no green tomato taste at all. I ordered the Texas brisket sandwich - very good. Also got the peanut slaw. Hmmm. Very vinegary - couldn't finish it. My husband got the fried shrimp and catfish platter. Same thick, burned batter on the shrimp and fish. He said he could taste nothing at all but batter. Skinny little fries that are impossible to eat and turn into cold mush very quickly. Biscuits were good, but the place is way too expensive for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Anyone who loves BBQ and seeks out the best will be disappointed. If you are new to BBQ you will find it okay. We went for lunch on a Saturday only to find that you CAN'T get lunch on a Saturday, only dinner. We were interested in a sampler platter. They are almost double the lunch price on the dinner menu. When I asked the waitress about the lunch menu she said \"not on the weekend\". I told her that I didn't plan on spending $30 for a lunch plate and she just shrugged her shoulders and smiled - very rude. The biscuits she brought were hard. We switched to sandwiches due to the high cost of things on the dinner menu. The bun was very thick and hard and I kept tearing pieces off to avoid a mouth full of bread. The cole slaw was very dry and had no flavor at all. My husband said the BBQ beans were very spicy and he likes spicy food so they must've been really spicy. Also there were only 3 types of BBQ sauces to choose from. Most BBQ paces have a greater variety of sauces. Overall the place did NOT live up to its smell. I don't understand all the people waiting to get in there. I suggest Honey Bears BBQ. It's not far away, has zero atmosphere but GREAT BBQ at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I always come to the Green Valley District and haven't tried this place, but tonight I was craving so BBQ so I decided to finally check it out!!

The service was a little on the slower side, but besides that I thought it was a great BBQ restaurant. The atmosphere, ambiance, and location of this restaurant makes it amazing! The food I thought was delicious, it was above average BBQ food I've had, but wouldn't put it in \"wow that was to die-for category\". I got the tri tip sandwich with potato salad for a side. The sandwich was HUGE so I was able to take 1/2 the sandwich home for left overs!

For appetizers, I tasted the friend onion rings, fried green tomatoes, and fried okra....all amazing! Definitely would get this appetizer again, just be prepared to eat and be full."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful food. Just received a flyer in the mail which had a few coupons. 15% off total bill, meal for two as well as new food specials. They do have a wonderful happy hour M-F 3-7 & 9 to close. I had a Crocodile Cooler that had Captain Morgan's and it was yummy. Our server was running around crazy as it was very busy but got us taken care of promptly and saw that we had everything we needed. She was very attentive. I love that it is fairly close to home and connected to the Red Rock Casino. If you like BBQ they have some great sauces too."}
{"text":"Holidays for restaurants are their busiest times. That being said, waiting an hour to be seated is never a surprise and not the best of times. Just make sure you have good company to make the time go fast. Appreciate the text message updates of place in line. Now, waiting with Tokyo Teas (Think Long Island without the Coke, add Midori) in hand made the wait even more bearable. Appreciate the speed in which the bartender knocked out 2 Tokyo Teas, 1 Rum Punch, and an old fashioned. We had an accident with one of the Tokyo Teas when being seated, and management replaced it...with no issue and without having to ask them. The food was phenomenal, HOT, and well worth the wait to be seated. You won't get your food instantly, but good things come to those who wait. Recommend tag teaming dishes, because they are large...this will save you some money, but won't cheat you on the quantity of savory goodness."}
{"text":"I'm having a wonderful evening with my friend Karen at Lucilles!!! We love this place. We enjoyed delicious fried chicken. They served us the best hot fried green tomatoes and garlic mashed potatoes and perfect cooked mixed vegetables. Our server was savannah. She was attentive and polite and made our evening special  !!!! Make sure you get the peach lemonade!!!! Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Is it bad that I made my decision to eat here based on the fact that they give away free tootsie pops? Oh well either way the BBQ here is definitely slow cooked to perfection and the portion sizes are built for a man not a boy. Come hungry, leave happy, now that's my kind of environment. 

I prefer to eat outside. The vibe is more southern and it seems to just feel right. They are always packed so be prepared to wait for a bit...but trust me it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 5pm. Surprisingly was seated right away but asked for a booth and hosted walked us back and forth past empty booths then sort of tossed menus on table and walked away. Very strange. 
Wife ordered tea and I ordered a beer. Tea came right away but had to ask twice for my beer. Finally arrived with our appetizer. 
Food was good but not fantastic. 
Been for happy hour and price and selection are great, however standard menu prices are a little above standard.
Will return but only for happy hour."}
{"text":"Lucille's BBQ has very good food, and service is generally good.

Their trip-tip sandwich or dinner is particularly good, as well as their beans, roasted corn and biscuits.

I enjoy coming here although waits can be long, particularly on weekends.  Location is very good as well at The District at Green Valley Ranch.

This is more of a 'premium' BBQ restaurant if such a thing exists, based on its good location and food.  Expect to pay a little more (perhaps $25 - $30 per person) for your meal here, with a requisite quality improvement over the standard BBQ restaurant, in my opinion.

Can get loud, and I prefer to sit in the main restaurant area, vs. the bar area or the 'verandah' type area (which gets hot or cold easier).

Good choice for large groups or families assuming there is no wait."}
{"text":"Good solid experience.  We had a group of big eaters in the back area of the restaurant - I wish I could remember the servers name - she was fantastic.  One of the best I've ever seen with a larger group.  The decor is perfect, restaurant and bathrooms are very clean.  Drinks are great.  The way the place is organized breaks it up into smaller sections - so  you never feel like you're in a bit cafeteria.

We enjoyed the complementary biscuits - OMG - crispy on the outside and so soft inside.  With the cinnamon butter - perfect.  One has to be careful - you don't want to fill up on bread before dinner!

Appetizers - shared some Fried Green tomatoes - solid.  My favorite - a special \"Shrimp and Corn and Jalapeño\" fritters.  with the dipping sauce... FANTASTIC!

I had a brisket plate and roasted veggies, garlic mashed potatoes.  The Potatoes were average - I couldn't really taste the garlic, but it was good.  Wish they had been served with a butter or small bit of gravy - a little dry.  The veggies were very good.  A nice mix of various veggies and very colorful.

My meat was the brisket.  Very flavorful - and my favorite of the sauces served was the hot and spicey - but all were very good.  Next time I want to try the burnt ends... I wish they had a dinner version of that - not just the appetizer option.

Others near me enjoyed sandwiches and salads... everyone seemed pleased with their choices.  Lucille's is the real deal - not bad for a chain."}
{"text":"Apparently the employees desire to watch the game with full volume outweighs the customers expectations of a peaceful dinner sans sport center. 

I have been here before and the TVs are normally on but on mute with pleasant music playing in the background. Not this time! This time the TV was so loud that I could not hear the people at my table and the frantic cadence of the sports announcer was the opposite of relaxing. 

If I had wanted to go to a sports bar I would have. I didn't I came to Lucilles instead and ended up being subjected to the loud yammering of a sports announcer. 

Food was good as usual but ambiance is part of the experience and tonight it was ruined."}
{"text":"Came today for my brother birthday, everyone was great. Food was awesome and service was top scale. Austin was my server, greet guy. He needs a RAISE!!!! 
Thanks. 
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite bbq place! I always order take out, and I'm never disappointed! Their hot links are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Very good food but the service was horrible! The restaurant was only about half full. We were in a back corner and it took forever to get a waiter to come over...then the manager came, took the order and drinks, and then introduced us to our actual server...who never came back. We had to call the manager over again to get refills on drinks. All the servers were too busy talking to each other.

It's always disappointing when good food is ruined by poor service..."}
{"text":"This is the worst BBQ I have ever had.  I just moved here from SC and should probably move back if this is what AZ considers BBQ.  The grits I had were more like a soup made with cornmeal, terrible.  My beef rib was so sickly sweet I really didn't enjoy it.  The pulled pork was a total nightmare, it came in a pool of liquid making me think that it was recooked in a liquid to warm it back up, it lacked flavor and really had no smoke taste.  The tri-tip was boring.  The sweet tea was more like tea flavored simple syrup.  The thing that was supposed to be a sugar covered biscuit was hard and crispy, not like any biscuit I've ever had

This place was completely underwhelming.  I make better bbq at home in my oven.  I can certainly buy better in a prepackaged super market.  

Not to mention my lunch cost $20.  I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"I had to give this place a try after reading the reviews and I normally don't do media posting I just love to read others feedback.
Now I must say if you want a delicious biscuit with apple butter go there. But if you are looking for a rib dinner that does not take your splurge money for the week stay away.
The ribs and the dinner I had was baby back full rack,sweet potato fries (cold) and creamy cold slaw (dry). Two dinners almost the same left me $68 dollars short and still hungry,
Wait staff all nice and friendly but I went to eat and paying that kind of money I did not expect to go home to raid the fridge.
So with the three stars it sll goes to the biscuits and our waiter Austin!
Lower the price give a little more and I may go back...
Just saying folks be ready to shed the $!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, just beautiful.

I had the Louisiana Pasta and wife had the steak and shrimp with potatoes and Mac n cheese, all was amazing!"}
{"text":"If I ever find myself on death row or am read my last rights and asked what I want for my final meal here, Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-b-que is it.  I would order one of the  BBQ feasts that feeds a whole family.  I would gorge myself to death before whatever else is going to take me gets a chance.  And I would, quite simply, die a happy camper.

Back in the real world, however, I didn't do much better.  I had the combo platter with BBQ half chicken and baby back ribs.  This comes with your choice of 2 sides - I decided to go southern all the way with southern sweet potatoes and braised greens - and a homemade biscuit with apple butter.

It's eyes-rolling-in-the-back-of-your-head good.  And it held up extremely well with the Murphy-Goode Petit Verdot I paired it with.  Okay, so maybe a true southerner I'm not.

Now, I've been here many times, and admit that it can be hit or miss for whatever reason, but tonight I finished the meal feeling so satisfied that if I were dying, I would be okay with it.  As it stands, the calories are going to kill me because I'm still living on, but I don't have to worry about that until the morning.

Good night and sweet and tangy bar-b-que dreams to all!"}
{"text":"4/16/16.Usually rave about Lucille's. Been here several times and never had a poor experience. We were on a bit of a time crunch and had about an hour to eat and get to our destination. Plenty of time normally. Service was great overall. Our waitresses name was Desert(spelling), she was very nice and did a great job. We watched multiple tables get their food before us. They were all seated after us. We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting. We ended up waiting about 30 more minutes and we had to leave before we could eat. We canceled the food and I was told the manager would be out to speak with me. So I then waited another ten minutes for the manager (Tiffany) to come out. At this point I almost walked out without paying for anything, but I didn't want to leave the waitress with that. The manager wasn't really the nicest about the situation. Wasn't very apologetic and offered to comp the dish(nothing else). I wasn't going to pay for the dish anyways but thanks. I was ready to pay for what we had consumed though. I left a tip for the waitress on my check. After realizing it the managers name was on the receipt as the waitress, so I'm hoping that she didn't get her tip because I would have left no tip at thay point. I have a pretty bitter taste about this place right now. We were almost 30 minutes late to where we were going which was a Rattlers football game. We ended up missing the entire firdt quarter."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and even better service! This is our new favorite restaurant. So glad we gave it a try. I love that it has an entrance from the parking lot so you don't have to go through a loud, smokey casino to get there."}
{"text":"I just have to say \"Apple butter\".  OMG I think I could spread it on newspaper and eat it lol. But at Lucille's they have great rolls for that :). Seriously, great food and service a top notch BBQ resturant that lives up to the price tag"}
{"text":"This place surprised me with how good it is! The food was great, and the live band on the weekends was a nice touch. I came here with a few friends so I was able to sample some of the different types of meats and everyone of them was delicious!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for lunch around 2 PM. Ordered a beer and waited about 10 minutes. Thought they must be really busy, got up to look around, hardly anyone there. No one behind the bar. When food came the guy didn't bother to ask who order which plate, just put them down in front of us. Wrong plates. Fries were cold. Called waitress over and asked for hot fries and also the biscuits she never brought. She was very polite and took care of it. Must say, the meat was excellent. Baby Backs, burnt tips and chicken."}
{"text":"Rolls were very good with cinnamon butter, but waitress seamed distracted all night.1 Corn was undercooked and BBQ brisket was just \"ok\". After we were done, we waited about 10 minutes to get our check, on a Thurs night around 8pm. Finally got up to leave and found our waitress socializing with her other waitress friends. Not a very good experience. Won't  go again."}
{"text":"I LOVE Lucilles!

I always get either the pulled brisket, or the texas style brisket on a plate with veggies or baked potato.. and a big glass of strawberry lemonade..

Their  TO-Go is also very convenient.. 

Prices are reasonable.. Ambiance is great, during the weekend they have live music/band playing music int he bar area."}
{"text":"First off the inside looks pretty cool, gives you that backyard BBQ'ing feel.

Next the food, it was delicous. The service was great too, very fast and super friendly.

The bad, they are a little pricey so be prepared. I would say equal to a Dave's BBQ but pricier."}
{"text":"Had the baby back they were awesome. Fall off the bone and had a good sauce on them. Also had the tri tip that was ok but dry unfortunately. The biscuits they give you are good and they give you this sweet butter that is amazing."}
{"text":"Lucille's has the best barbecue in town. I tried other items that were excellent such as the marinated steak in steak gravy and the fried chicken with pan gravy. I love the fried green tomatoes and cheese grits as well."}
{"text":"My mother and I tried this place for a happy hour getaway. I was pleasantly surprised by the happy hour menu items and was so happy to get great deals on the drinks. My mom and I absolutely loved how they cut up the ribs and they were tender. The greeting staff and bartender offered excellent customer service we felt welcomed."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend to Lucille's for his birthday last week and we still can't stop talking about how bomb the smoked BBQ ribs were.  Fried okra was awesome, stellar beer selection (highly recommend the house summer brew), and they have wings that compete too.  The apple butter and rolls though wasn't a winner for me, but why fill up on that when you come for the BBQ?  A little pricey, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Très bon le service et comme on n'aime là boisson à volontés les petits pains un délice"}
{"text":"We had Ashley/Kelly as our server today and from one server to another, I haven't had service as complete and exceptional as hers today. She was attentive and very friendly, going the extra mile to ensure our experience was good. She stayed with us even while handling other larger tables and never seemed flustered or rushed through our service to accommodate others. A very nice experience all around, I will ask to be seated with her next time I dine in."}
{"text":"Good food as always but tonight we had even better service tonight with Ashley,  we were seated in the bar. Ashley was super sweet, personable & the service time was fast. Ask for her when u go!"}
{"text":"Yum yum, give me some more!

I hardly ever feel like eating barbecue, but after listening to one of my friends go on about how incredibly delicious Lucille's is, I had to check it out for myself. There was no wait at all when we went and we got our orders in right away: one sweet tea, water, onion straws ($8.79), and BBQ Beef Ribs ($28.99 for 7 bones). Our entree was served with homemade biscuits and two sides (macaroni and roasted garlic mashed potatoes). The apple butter and biscuits might've been my favorite part of the whole meal. I wasn't very fond of the onion straws, but that's because I never really am. Don liked them a lot though. The sweet tea was very tasty and refreshing, but didn't come with free refills, so we just nursed it. The beef ribs were very hearty and mouthwatering. They were well cooked and very tender as well. Definitely the best ribs I've had at a restaurant in a good while. Even though the food was awesome, I'll admit I think the place is a tad overpriced, which is why I'd probably only come here a few times in a year.

*Happy hour! 3-7pm Monday through Friday and 9pm 'til close"}
{"text":"I don't like to give \"meh\" reviews, but here goes...the food is great.  Biscuits and sweet butter are to die for, ribs are yummy, LOVE the cornbread.  BUT, you can very much tell that the servers/bussers are trained to get you OUT of there.  I was having a nice dinner with my friend, and they cleared plates out of nowhere...so there went our cole slaw, baked beans, corn bread, and biscuits that we were still eating.  Annoying!  As a foodie, though, I would still go back (I'd rather have great food and poor service than vice versa) and just make sure I'm paying attention to what the servers are doing.  They wanted us out ASAP!"}
{"text":"It was Saturday nights during there busy time. They offered a booth at the bar and we got right in. The service was a little slower because we were at the bar but it wasn't any bad service we just had to wait a little longer but the girl was really nice and once we order the food came right out and it was delicious. I love the st Lou's style ribs and their French fries."}
{"text":"OMG what a joke.... Let's see do I start with bad waitress , bad food or bad corporate chain trying there hand at BBQ...

Let's start with waitress who would be talking as she was walking away like she had better things to do other that take my order. But then came the food which my beef rib was like a hard bone. Coleslaw had zero taste but then who cares because once u got there beef ribs did you  really wanna taste anything else they serve?

We made the trek from the strip thinking it was a local BBQ hangout , instead we got a corporate chain....

Now I know my BBQ, and fly to Austin just for it. And this place is no
BBQ standout. So my advice is stay away."}
{"text":"I could eat Lucille's every day, every night and every hour of the year. I would be 200+ pounds, but I would be happy.

Lucille's recently released their new menu which denotes gluten free items. If you're worried about not having a bunch of choices to eat here, have no fear. You will have plenty of options here if you have a gluten allergy, and all of the staff seems very knowledgeable about the allergy which makes me feel very comfortable eating here.

I love the feel of this restaurant and the layout. You can either eat outside, inside in the enclosed porch, in the main dining room or in the bar. My husband and I like to go to their late night happy hour in the bar because the music is great (we love the blues), and the drink and food prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and booze we consume.

It is easy to share a plate at Lucille's, especially at dinner time. We normally split an entree and get a half appetizer and/or salad which is plenty of food for us. We have yet to eat anything at Lucille's that isn't delicious. The brisket can sometimes be a little dry, but most of the time it is juicy with just enough of the fat and barbecue bark on the outside to make my tummy sing. I am a huge fan of their smoked chicken, whether it is the breast of dark quarter, I could eat it all. The trip tip is always perfectly cooked, and my husband and I can happily eat our way through a plate of rib tips in under five minutes. The hot link is great, and if you want to go bananas, try the beef rib. The rib is a meal itself with a decent amount of fat, but it reminds me of the ribs I ate in SC which were always delicious. 

Their smoked brisket salad is exactly what I wanted it to be. Smokey, sweet, savory and delicious. We've had most of their sides, and my favorite are their sweet potato mashed potatoes, creamy coleslaw and potato salad. Beware: If you get the baked potato, know that it is massive enough to share between two to three people! And their stuffed baked potatoes are nothing short of carbohydrate goodness. Sometimes stuffed potatoes end up being all potato by the end, but they really stuff the potatoes here at Lucille's, and they are great!

All in all, I highly doubt you'll be disappointed if you eat at Lucille's and love barbecue. Regardless of the type of barbecue you like, you'll be satisfied eating at this restaurant.

P.S. Their drinks are crazy good. I like their Skinny Drinks, especially the one made with gin and basil. Not too strong or sweet, but it packs a punch! My husband is a fan of the Crocodile Cooler which, even though it is all alcohol, masks its strength with the right combination of juices. Just know that after one, you better eat some food to help sober you up!"}
{"text":"Southern BBQ with a 50's Blues club atmosphere. Prices solidly moderate, the waitress polite and efficient. 

Get this: service was so fast that the manager actually apologized, and gave us our salad for free! Um, okay!

Especially enjoyed the artichoke appetizer and peach lemonade. The BBQ was spot on, and the 3 sauces were as well--not too sugary or overwhelming, but complimented the meats just right. 

A very enjoyable venue for the next time you crave BBQ!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the service was good their policies suck.  I went to dinner with my 22 year old son.  Unfortunately his drivers license is a portrait mode vs landscape indicating that when the license was issued he was under 21 years old and they wouldn't serve him. For that reason I will choose to do business elsewhere. 

Their manager Desiree was apologetic but without flexibility. It was too bad."}
{"text":"My old standby for BBQ at the District.  I've been coming here since the place opened up years ago and have never had a bad experience.  Based on my limited exposure to this type of food, it tastes quite good and I wouldn't change a thing. Fan for life...thanks!"}
{"text":"It was recommended to us and it was delicious, my husband had the two meat combo with ribs and fried chicken, I had the fried chicken it was amazing very moist and tender, a lot of food.  Kim was our server and she was great!!  We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I used to love Lucille's, I like the flavors of their meats usually, and their sides are terrific. But on my past couple of visits the spare ribs were so small they look like baby backs, and to make matters worse, they were overcooked and dry. They rely too much on their sauce.  I really hope they'll get back to the aficionado attention they used to give barbecue in the early days. I'll try them again, but if they disappoint me with the ribs again this love affair will be over."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that this is one of the more popular places at the GVR District, however there is no way I can say it's the \"Best BBQ in the Valley\" with John Mull's Meats: Road Kill Grill.

That being said I've gone here twice and I would come back again.  The price point is a little higher than Famous Dave's and I'm not sure I can taste a huge difference (take that with a grain of salt, I've only had two menu items!).  Portions are large and a normal shorter than 6' 5\" person will fill up quickly.  Drinks are served in large caning jars and there are PLENTY of sides to choose from with your dinner.

I personally had the brisket which was very tasty, although I had two pieces which were layered in a decent amount of fat that were not consumable.  The sweet rolls they bring to the table with cinnamon butter are a tasty warm-up for the main course.  I would be interested in trying more things here, but i doubt I'll make a special trip, in fact we were originally going to Top Notch BBQ but they were closed for the evening."}
{"text":"This is a good, consistent BBQ place! Is it the best in the city? Probably not. But I am always happy when it is the suggested spot to meet. Yes. They are great groups or if family is in town! Affordable and super kid friendly too!

Every time I have been the service is A++
The food has been a solid B+

The apps are some of my favorites. Love the Caesar salad. 
Maybe small plates for dinner might be the thing to try next time?"}
{"text":"Food, service and live band were all incredible!  The brisket was so tender that it felt like it melted in my mouth. Mac n cheese was super gooey cheesy.  Tasted like a blend of several cheeses. The greens were incredible. It all taste like the recipe was carefully handed down from someone's great grandma. Bartenders and waiters were all very knowledgeable and friendly. The live bands played good old fashion funk music, very loud. The atmosphere encouraged strangers to mingle and offer suggestions.  Great place to eat, drink and be merry!"}
{"text":"I finally remembered to get the brisket plate this time..and it was a little tough at first, but the bottom was nice and tender. Missed a 5 star review by thaaat much. 86'd on the sweet potato fries, annd, our server was in a bigger hurry than we were, slamming down items, forgetting refills, and the entrees came mins into the salad course..butttt...it was great."}
{"text":"Manager rec the 2 meat special for 30$ bc \"it has more meat\" what does that mean in lbs? We felt totally jipped."}
{"text":"Without a doubt...the best barbecue I have ever had in my life!...and I've been around. Everything I have had there is far beyond delicious! The ribs (all varieties), hot links, tri-tip, pulled pork, corn on the cob, slaw...top notch all the way!

I only have one question...famous who??"}
{"text":"This place...so freaking messy and sticky and spicy and gooey good!  Came here on a Saturday night with my husband and even at 8pm there was a 40 minute wait.  I wanted to go shopping during the wait and with this incredibly handy (and maybe new...I've never heard of it anyway) method of TEXTING you when your table is ready rather than giving you a flashing and vibrating apparatus that only allows you to meander a short distance from the restaurant, shopping would have been possible!  However, my practical, resourceful and uber intelligent husband discovered that we could seat ourselves in the bar area immediately.  My suggestion is to sit there (assuming there are available tables) if the wait's long and if you don't have kids with you, of course.  
We don't drink so our dinner order was placed almost immediately (hey...we were hungry!)
I wish I would have gotten our servers name so I could give her a shout out here cause she was awesome.  Attentive and funny and super knowledgeable on the menu (girl could rattle off the litany of side items like nobody's business!).  
My husband got the back porch trio dinner - ribs, chicken and tri tip.  He chose mashed potatoes and cole slaw for sides.  He devoured it all.  Oink...Oink.  I got a bite of his chicken and it was seriously amazing.  Tender and flavorful and fall off the bone juicy.  The potatoes were good - mashed and seasoned and delicious just like Mom's homemade.  Here's the thing - my husband is super picky about his cole slaw.  It can't be warm, it can't be watery, yada yada yada.  He was concerned that he may not like it and told the server as much.  She graciously told him that if he didn't, she would gladly replace it with something else.  Well, he loved it.  So much that he wanted to order an additional side of it.  See, they put horseradish in there so it has a little kick.  Yummy indeed.
I got the Mardi Gras chicken which, truthfully, is enough for 3 or 4 people.  It's two massive chicken breasts that are breaded and fried on top of mashed potatoes, covered with this creamy, spicy cajun sauce that has andouille sausage, bell peppers and shrimp in it.  There's a lot going on with this one but it all works so well together.  It comes with grilled veggies that are a perfect compliment to the heaviness of the chicken/sausage/shrimp/spicy goodness.  
But let's talk about the biscuits.  Praise the Lord they are out of this freaking world.  Huge and fluffy and warm and soft on the inside with a golden brown outside.  They come with honey butter that is slightly sweet, extremely marvelous.  I really feel like if all I had to eat that night were biscuits, I'd be completely and totally content.  
The bar area is loud.  Actually, the entire restaurant is loud.  There's a lot of seating, both tables and booths, and they even have a wraparound indoor veranda of sorts for seating as well.  The decor is decidedly southern (no doy kee) with lots of interesting things to look at and admire.  (Bonus - just outside of the restroom is a leg lamp, the one made famous in the classic movie, A Christmas Story.  It was a major award, you know!)  The photo ops are endless here.  
All in all, I love Lucille's.  Like love it so much that I'd be 200 pounds if I ate here too often.  It's a splurge for sure, nutrition wise.  Money speaking, we spent about $60 before tip for the both of us.  It's worth it.  Promise."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I will definitely be frequenting this place more often after the experience we had last night. It was a Friday night so a 25 minute wait seemed reasonable. A whole 13 minutes later we were being seated. Drinks came quickly, the Pulled Pork Queso Dip was great, and so were the biscuits. Ugh, the butter... Anyway, I ordered the Half Chicken & Two Meats, my boyfriend ordered the Brisket Burger. About 10 minutes later we get a half chicken and a plate of just brisket. Our server came back to check on us and we let him know we didn't get what we ordered. He wasn't very apologetic, quickly rushed through taking our orders again, and took the plates back. We weren't rude or angry, just wanted what we ordered. A few minutes later a manager came by with our correct meals and gave us a sincere apology. She offered to bring us more biscuits too... we gladly accepted. Our meals were delicious as always, our server checked on us a few times and eventually apologized. Toward the end of our meal another manager came by to apologize again and thanked us for our patience. He even surprised us by comping our entire meal. Overall we weren't happy with the way the server handled the situation but it was a pretty busy night and maybe he was having an off night. Management definitely saved the day with us and we'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"\"I love the Jambalaya & Cucumber Lemonade here!\" The desserts are good as well. I recommend the banana pudding."}
{"text":"I had never been to Lucille's before and I wouldn't say that BBQ food is my favorite, but I really enjoyed this place! The food, the service, and the atmosphere is great! I had the spinach dip and the original pulled pork sandwich, which were both exceptionally delicious. My favorite part was the aaaamazing biscuits and apple butter they give you! - soooo good! They serve your drinks in big mason jars, which was pretty cool and even offer to give you a soda to go once you're done your dinner! However, I think the part I enjoyed most was the atmosphere. The district at GVR is beautiful! - Nice, landscaped areas, with great stores, lots of people (and dogs!), and even live music! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"A Family Friendly BBQ. 

I've been here a few times now and still nothing really \"wows\" me. The food is good, but not great and honestly, \"family friendly\", restaurants just don't do it for me; I usually come here out of pure convenience. 

Now, if it's just you and a friend or your date, I recommend sitting at the bar. You don't have to wait in line to sit and the service at the bar is much faster and the bartenders here all awesome, insanely attentive and your beer or water glass is never empty.  

This time around I tried the Brisket Burnt Ends, Southern Fried Dill Pickles and the Smoked Burnt Ends Salad. Burnt ends are good way to gauge a BBQ's place food. These should be like meat-butter and have almost no fat on them, but Lucille's burnt ends have a little more fat than I would like and are a tad chewy. This is the second time I've ordered these meat nuggets and this seems to be the norm. 

The fried pickles are very good. The only \"beef\" (ha) I have with is these is the crispy outside, it never stays on after the first bite. This is something that's synonymous with all fried pickles. 

The meat filled salad was very good, but loaded to the brim with onions. I mean there had to be at least one full red onion in this salad. The brisket was plentiful and the flavor was there, when not being overpowered by onions. If you're a lover of salads, this is definitely worth a try, but ask for onions on the side unless you absolutely love that stinky vegetable. 

Looking for a cookie cutter BBQ joint that gets the job the done? Look no further."}
{"text":"Good Ole lip smacking Southern BBQ served very well with lots of fun and welcome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was great.  The server was very personable, prompt and attentive.  I believe it was the manager who dropped by once to ask how everything was going.

 I liked the bbq chicken most of all.  It was moist and the smoky flavor made it so tasty.  I barely added any bbq sauce to it.  I loved that you didn't have to ask for extra sauce if needed.  There were two full bottles already on the table.  One regular and the other spicy, both very flavorful.  What I liked about the beef rib is that you just had to tackle it with both hands and just gnaw the meat right off the bone and with not a thought of decorum.  Unlike a lot of people who prefer the meat that just falls off the bone,  I enjoy using my \"canines\".

The pieces of tri tip, however,  got a C-.  It was only because I'm accustomed to it being medium rare.  Between the smoking, grilling and warming for serving, it inevitably gets to be well done and a bit dry. 

The beans were on the sweet side, just as I like it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and was seated fairly quickly. My 4 year old wasn't feeling good and the waiter Alfonso was kind and provided my daughter a cloth to help her feel better. If you visit Lucille's at the District be sure to ask for Alfonso!! Thank you Alfonso we will ask for you on our next visit!!"}
{"text":"This was not a pleasant dining experience.

Once we were seated it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge our existence. That's unacceptable, especially for a mid-tier priced restaurant that ended up being $30 a person (with alcohol). 

My friend and I split a half order of the appetizer platter and a 2 meat combo deal with bbq ribs, brisket, mac-n-cheese, and sweet potato, with meat-sauced-drenched watermelon in the middle. The first part of the meal felt like this http://bit.ly/qVmIqr, there was an over-abundance of fried food. The second part was just way too much; toward the end, I only ate because I didn't want to the food to go to waste. The food was significantly less quality than past experiences I've had here. The ribs were burnt to a crisp and the brisket tasted old.

I'd pass on this place. At this point, I feel that Buzz is the King of Vegas BBQ.

EDIT: The owner just contacted me after my last review, and frankly I am very grateful of respectful customer service. The food has been the best BBQ in Vegas in the past and I look forward to trying it again soon."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the quality of food here. Waitress was helpful and cheery but couldn't make up for the bland dry food. Baby back ribs half order were fatty, dry .. Mac cheese was disgusting watery, no cheese in sight mess.... biscuits were lukewarm dry and tasteless.... appetizer plate fried okra,green tomatoes,pickles and onion strings appeared to frozen items dropped in hot grease and was tasteless. Best thing on the menu that is now removed was the shrimp po-boy......uhhhh never again!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Good quick service. Our waitress  Amanda was especially helpful. Thank you Kings Fish House for pissing us off and making us come here."}
{"text":"$30 for 2 pulled pork sandwiches and a lemonade. I don't think it was worth it. It was just \"meh\". Atmosphere was ok, lots to look at. I would much rather drive a bit further to Joe's Real BBQ for the best Pulled Pork sandwich in the state."}
{"text":"Wow is this place overpriced!! 

Lucille's used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but they've changed. Either somebody picked off my plate before it got to me or I just paid $20 for 3 or 4 forkfulls of dry brisket. I think they were supposed to be slices. It was more like a handful of brisket chips. They were tough and tiny. No flavor to them whatsoever. No mop sauce. No smoke. No taste. I had to put salt on it. Side dishes should not dwarf your entree. There was more corn and potatoes than there was beef. There's no beef shortage that I'm aware of, and this wasn't Kobe beef, so I have to question. I doubt very much that was 7 oz even pre-cooked weight. Apparently it was $20 corn and potatoes, and I didn't get any biscuits like it says it comes with. I'm fluent in TX and Southern BBQ. This is just ridiculous. I'm just gonna go to Rudy's next time. If I'm gonna pay $20 for brisket, there better be some brisket on the plate!"}
{"text":"The biscuits are to die for! And that honey butter! The food proportions are huge and I can never finish anything on my plate. I really love their whole experience and atmosphere. It's noisy and a little chaotic and it works. I just wouldn't come here looking for a quiet place to eat!"}
{"text":"The way the host and seating is done is a horrible system. They text you which allows u to leave the area. We saw one table empty for over 25 minutes, another for 10-15 and one for 5 minutes. We were 7th on the list to be seated but these tables were empty for so long. When we asked hostess about this she was nothing but rude.  Food is good but not sure I'll be back bc of the service. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Loved our lunch here.  Ate on the porch love the southern feel to this restaurant. Had the pork queso which was delicious. The biscuits are amazing with the apple butter.  By the time we finished out biscuits and queso our food arrived. I had the pulled pork which was melt in your mouth good. Even the kids meals are great.  One daughter had the grilled cheese with Mac and Cheese and the other had the ribs. Wish I had taken more pictures but did get one of the Hubby's watermelon ice team. Love that their drinks including pop come in large Mason jars.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Lucille's until I won a gift card for 50$. I heard through the grapevine to make reservations and I am glad that I did. 
6:30 on a Sat night and it was packed, the bar, the outside patio, and the dining area, hardly a free table in the house. 
I loved the decor-- like I was visiting a family member's house in the South which made the place a very family/kid friendly environment. 
The wait staff was very friendly and attentive even with the place being so busy. Some one was always asking us for refills and giving us an update on our order.The tables were busy quickly and often. 
I ordered the grilled salmon which was a very large piece of fish and a huge side of vegetables-cooked perfectly. My other half ordered a pulled pork sandwich. The mashed potatoes were a hit at our table. 
We didn't have room for dessert so next time we may just order appetizers and dessert. As we left a small band was setting up in the bar area... This place was going to be rocking for hours to come.
(PS. our bill came out to $50.77 so that was perfect deal with our gift card)"}
{"text":"Very tasty BBQ platters. We had the tri tip, chicken & baby back rib platter. Loved the ribs & tri tips. The chicken was too smoky for my taste, but very tender. Excellent strawberry lemonade & biscuits. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I don't know how people can't give this place 5 stars.  I've been here probably 10-15 times in the last few years and have yet to have a bad experience.  I come to Lucilles on special occasions when I'm looking to spend a little money on a nice big quality meal.  The meat is so succulent and juicy, always perfect everytime I go here.  The portions are very nice, as they should be at their price heh.  The service is great, you get your food extremly quick.  Sugar biscuits with apple butter? Amazing!  I do however miss their flame roasted corn on the cob that they had a year or so ago.  They used to serve it differently, now its not as exciting, but hey...its just corn.  I'm there for the meat anyways.  The tri-tip dinner is the best meal there, highly recommend it if you visit there for your first time.  You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"We have eaten at several BBQ places in our travels. We compare them to Lucille's BBQ and we feel that Lucille's BBQ is the best BBQ around. The food is tasty especially the st. Louis baby back pork ribs. Service is always excellent. The portions are usually too much for one person so you end up taking some home. I don't care much for grits but I love their cheese grits and collard greens. Highly recommend Lucille's barbeque if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"First time here last night. They offer variety of natural flavored teas and lemonades. For me, everything is perfect from drinks to food to staff to dining setup to variety of sauces on the table. We tried the watermelon iced tea. I love it when they serve it on a jar. We had tri cut, beef rib and baby back ribs. Meat is tender, juicy and flavorful. Im definitely coming back and bringing more friends."}
{"text":"BBQ heaven. The food is authentic, savory and everything you'd ever want at a barbecue place.We got the small appetizer sampler and was more than enough for our party of four. I tried the tri-tip sandwich and it was delicious. So much meat! Also the strawberry lemonade was refreshing and such a huge glass I didn't need a refill. 

Last came dessert, and I would highly recommend the Snickers ice cream cake. You'd be smart to share with someone as it is enormous. 

The service was a little slow and they didn't initially ask us if we even wanted dessert. In the end the food is what won, so hence the five-star review."}
{"text":"Rest your feet and come eat some delicious Cajun fair. The biscuits and apple butter will win you over (There is less guilt if the food is delicious). The mixed greens were almost as good as my mom's. I had the blackened catfish and the seasoning and buttery taste were a treat to my mouth. I had the watermelon tea, complete with chucks of fresh cut watermelon and that too was an interesting and delicious blend. By the way do not forget to try the cornbread - it is heavenly."}
{"text":"Great food, the smoke they use is not too overpowering. Staff is awesome and very friendly. Prices were reasonable. They have three different bbq sauces on the table to satisfy almost everyone's needs."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas!  Great staff and greater food."}
{"text":"This place is always so good. We shared a plate and it was more than enough food. The portions are generous. Our waitress, Kristina was excellent. She was very attentive, up sold without being pushy and anticipated our needs. The next time we come we will be sharing a plate and ask to sit in Kristine's section."}
{"text":"We took our Mom here for her 40th birthday and we were blown away by the customer service.  One of our meals came out a little dry, and we ended up sharing our food.  Our waiter (Kristin) realized we were not eating one of the dishes and asked us about it.  She ended up talking to her manager (Lori) who ended up bringing out a brand new dish and a birthday peach cobbler.  This exemplary customer service made it a memorable night for the family.  Definitely recommending to our close friends!"}
{"text":"Everything thing we ordered beef ribs, fried tomato appetizer, wing appetizer, beef ribs, baby back ribs, Salisbury steak, Mac and cheese beef Barbeque sliders all came out hot with no mistakes. Hard to find a wrong choice here. All the food is great. Service was tip top."}
{"text":"Always a good meal. It's not inexpensive and it's not quiet...but the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"this place is not for the dieters. went here for dinner tonight and left plenty full after sharing a half order of fried pickles and eating half my gumbo.
they start you out with some bisquits. (mmm buttermilk bisquits!) very soft, fluffy, and warm as soon as he sat them down on the table. they also come with apple butter. putting a bisquit onto my plate and to my surprise they are topped with sugar. let me state that i am head over heels for dessert at all hours of the day, but i just didn't care for sugared buttermilk bisquits and apple butter. i wish they left them plain. :( pout.
onto the fried pickles. i love me some southern fried pickles just not as sticks. (refer to picture.) i have never had them in the shape of a fried stick but i was let down. the fried coating was falling off and it was very messy. (not to mention greasy.) they were okay, but not something i will crave.
i go for the gumbo for the main course. i have had some good gumbo in my day and maybe that led me to be spoiled. it was spicy. i liked the sausage in it, but they didn't chop up the chicken. i had a whole chunk of chicken in my gumbo soup and a whole lotta rice. the flavoring was good and like i said spicy. even made my nose run! i sort have wish i went for something else though.
apparently everyone else in my party loved their meals including the ribs and chicken. someone else had the fried shrimp and really liked it. the servers were really nice and attentive. i feel i should give it another try if everyone else liked their meals so i will give it 3 stars for that and the lovely service we had.
i hope other people have better luck then i did."}
{"text":"Delicious! Their biscuits and butter are fantastic. I love the bbq chicken sliders, and they have the BEST sides. One of my favorite southern restaurants to visit. Their banana pudding is also amazing."}
{"text":"I'd love to be able to comment however we were told it was a 30 minute wait and here we are still waiting at 70 minutes. Seriously I doubt the food is worth this wait!"}
{"text":"oh man, when ever the girls are in vegas.... after a long nite partying and after sleepin' in until 4 in the afternoon -- nothing is better than getting a delivery of lucille's bbq -- slab of ribs and steak and jambalaya!! they are soo good....

when the boys that we left back home have behaved well and were good while we were gone -- we sometimes remember to stop off at lucille's for lunch right before our flight out and bring them a slab home... =P"}
{"text":"The restaurant was very nice and clean.. The server came over and took our drink order's really quick. The second server brought our drinks very quick and let us know our server will be Cindy. 
My family and I had a great meal thanks to our server Cindy who made some fantastic suggestions.  We love the tri tips she brought us and the rest of our dinner. Cindy made sure she didn't leave us hanging she made sure our glasses was alway's filled at all times, she made sure we had napkins and hot towels to clean our hands. 
My family and I enjoyed our dessert that hot Peach cobbler with that crumb topping was off the chain..

Thank you Cindy for all your great services you gave my family and myself."}
{"text":"We love the food and service.  Always consistent.  Just wish you didnt walk out smelling like a wood chip smoker the rest of the day."}
{"text":"Possibly the best BBQ I have ever had. The free biscuits they bring out are amazing and  the pulled pork bbq sandwiches are beautiful. Interior was fun, great location, and the service was 10/10."}
{"text":"Don't order ribs and chops at 3:30 in afternoon. They are dried out and chewy. It was very disappointing. Expected food that would be tender and just fall apart but instead had to chew and chew."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Table staff is awesome. But why is the bartender with short brown hair so angry?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to eat here on 6-7-15. We were seated at around 4:00 and it was starting to get busy. As we were being seated we walked through the entire restaurant closest to the casino side. Here's when I started thinking what the heck is going on in here. We walked by about 20 tables and of those tables 10 were all dirty covered with plates, hmmm?? No busser? As we were seated we were greeted fast and ordered drinks. We got our drinks and ordered our appetizer we got the Chicken Fingers and BBQ potato chips BOTH were delish! By now 5 tables were all sat within 5 minutes in our servers section. He was trying his best to accommodate everyone but that's a lot all at once. I then watched a manager walk over passing at least 5 dirty tables not picking up one dirty plate or even to ask to fill a soda up saw that he was in over his head and drowning and walk away not even asking him if he needed help. We ordered our food, Pulled pork sandwich and he got the ribs with cole slaw and macaroni. It was all very good! When the food runner dropped off his ribs he said the macaroni was on its way but it never came and bc our server was way to busy we didn't get a chance to tell him. He handled it well and got us a desert on the house, snickers ice cream cake which was awesome as well. 
I work in the industry so I know what the server was going through. He had no help, no busser, AND the food runner forgot part of our order and no manager support. You get 3 stars bc Kevin was a great server but your restaurant as a team SUCKS. 

PS. Install a soda well in the back part of the restaurant so that the servers don't have to walk a mile to fill up people's drinks."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Just relocated here from Memphis Tennessee. Was looking for a good BBQ place and this is the best so far. Big portions for a good price. I had the Front Porch - Half Chicken, Ribs and Sausage. Sides of cheese grits and greens. To wash it down Sweet Tea. Service was outstanding. Justin could not have been more attentive."}
{"text":"*edit* the owner of this restaurant reached out to me and offered a gift card as an apology and invitation to try the restaurant again. I will edit the review again when I go back but  adding a star for exceptional customer service. 


Went for my boyfriend's birthday with our whole family at the start of October. Our waiter was excellent and very friendly (he even gave my aunt a back massage when she jokingly asked for one when he asked if we needed anything else).

The food wasn't too expensive for what it is supposed to be. Pricing is reasonable.  Food quality was sub par for everyone in the party.

We ordered beef and pork ribs as well as a steak and some shrimp.   Appetizers were delicious, but the meats were very underwhelming.  Two of the people in our group left feeling queasy from the odd tasting sauce on their ribs.

The biscuits and butter were fantastic though, and I may go back just to have the spinach dip appetizer and biscuits one night.  Maybe we went on an off night."}
{"text":"I will say that following our most recent visit and after my poor review from last visit has improved. I can tell you that our recent visit, there was a manager named Jeff that came around twice to our tables and others to ensure our service and food was acceptable.

We returned after a corporate manger responded to our poor rating and invited us back with a gift card."}
{"text":"Went for here for a work function and we got the feast...so good and an insane amount of food. We had a party of 9 and we're there for almost 3 hours. The bbq chicken, baby back ribs, and peach lemonade are my personal favorites. Can't wait to go back with my family."}
{"text":"All time favorite in Green Valley for BBQ.  Been enjoying the brisket & pulled pork since they opened back in 2003(?)

Service is always good even when the wait time is long.  We went last week on a Wed. night and ended up eating in the bar which isn't a bad thing at all.

Fried Green Tomatoes is a GREAT starter with a margarita!

The better half had the ribs but still feel that Tony Roma's has the best ribs head to head.  I might concur.  But for gooooood smoked beef brisket, NO ONE can match Lucille's!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and the food was excellent.  Salads were very good for the dieters in the group, though everything else was quite fattening, but yummy."}
{"text":"Not that impressed...maybe this particular chain isn't too good. Meat was dry and way over cooked. Quantity was large but quality was ehhh."}
{"text":"Oh my! This BBQ Smokehouse located inside the RedRock Casino is amazing. They actually SMOKE the meat 2-12hrs in-house.

We got Peach and Watermelon Iced Tea which was served in huge mason jars with an orange wedge. AMAZING!

We wanted to artichoke appetizer, but our server said it was out of season and not up to their standards so they would not serve it. bummer 

My sister and I shared the ribs and shrimp entree' that came with 2 sides. We chose sweet potato mash and mac n' cheese

The ribs were tasty and not dowsed in sauced. THey fell off the bone and with their in-house spicy bbq sauce it was delish!

The shrimp were butterflied and grilled to perfection. Wish there were more than 4 pieces.

THe sweet potato mash had a hint of cinnamon! Perfect for beginning of fall :)
The mac n' cheese was broiled to perfection.
Size of the sides were enough for 2 people!

My husband got the trio platter of Roasted Chiken (it melted like cotton candy!!)
Tri Tip and beef ribs (didnt try but he said he can't wait to go back)

overall amazing experience with amazing service."}
{"text":"The food and service at Lucille's is absolutely fantastic! The first time we went was on a Monday night, Labor Day, and we were greeted and seated immediately. The service was fast, food came fast, and everything was delicious from the warm biscuits with apple butter spread they serve while you're waiting, to the strawberry lemonade which was so fresh and sweet, down to the entrée (I had a hot link sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese!)

Everything was so Mmm Mmm good that we drove from the Vegas strip to dine there again the next night! 

Definitely worth stopping by if your in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Go here on a Sunday night like we did if you don't want to endure a long wait. I came here with a party of 9 and we waited less than 15 minutes!

The portions are huge, and the waitstaff - or at least our server, Teresa - is endlessly accomodating. I would have liked their sweet tea to be a little colder but I'm from NorCal, I like just about everything cold - it was delicious nonetheless! For our appetizers we had the onion straws (pretty standard fare but the honey mustard dipping sauce was amazing) and the fried green tomatoes (excellent).

Jambalaya was super spicy, loved it - and I had a beef brisket sandwich, which was a little dry but a couple of squirts of their Original BBQ Sauce solved everything. I had my choice of two sides, and I chose the peanut coleslaw and fries - they gave me a shitload of fries. If I weren't already so full from the appetizers I probably would have eaten them all - they were great.

The next time I come here, I'd like to try the desserts. 

I loved the bathrooms - the doors were designated as follows: \"Womens\", \"Mens\", and \"All Y'all\" (family rooms / baby changing tables). Too funny!

Overall, a great place to take family for a laid back good time. Come here on an empty stomach if possible, I'm sure I wouldn't have needed a box if I came here during lunch."}
{"text":"This is about as good as it gets in Vegas.  It's definitely more upscale for a BBQ joint.  The BBQ here is really good but a little pricey.  The good thing is the portions are ENORMOUS.  

We shared a 3 meat combo (St Louis Ribs, Chicken, and swapped Tri-Tip for Brisket).  It came with 2 sides for 27.99.  

Everything was great.  The chicken was so moist, brisket not dry, and the ribs were very tasty.  We really enjoyed the biscuits with apple butter - be sure to ask for more.

I am a BBQ snob so if anyone knows of a better place (not named Buzz), please message me.  

Till then i'll keep coming back here :8"}
{"text":"Delicious, probably the most delicious in vegas, but a little pricey.  Great atmosphere, great sauce, great meats, and great sides. They serve you biscuits before the meal that are awesome.  Have had some meals here that are better than others as I have received a few racks of ribs here that where charred up and dry.  I am not a big chicken fan but their chicken is some of the best I have ever had.  I get the porch combo with a choice of ribs, pulled pork, and a half a chicken for 26 bucks. 

I do love beef brisket and they don't carry it."}
{"text":"Very very good bbq here! Love the bbq half chicken; was very moist and had a great flavor. The lucille's chicken salad is also really good. For sides, the corn succotash is just ok, but the mashed sweet potatoes are quite tasty.

Nice southern feel to the restaurant and the mason jars that all the drinks come in are a really great idea.

Service is pretty good. A few times we've had some waiters who seem very new and don't check in very often.

Overall, a really nice little bbq joint."}
{"text":"Our experience today was very disappointing.   The server was so disinterested in her job it was more than apparent.   The food was cold, and the \"brisket\" was burned...  so disappointed. ."}
{"text":"I always have a great time at Lucille's at town center so this place was new for me was shocked when I saw inside of the casino. But the atmosphere was great and the service was good too. Always like the barbecue  & the desert very nice place to eat, especially after going to an evening movie at the casino."}
{"text":"We love the food at this restaurant but the service is absolutely awful. We have been forgotten on multiple occasions (including a Togo order)."}
{"text":"Love the food and service. I would recommend a reservation because the venue is so popular but even with how busy it is the service is good and the food is also. It's a little pricey for barbque in my opinion but I still go :)"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've been to! Food was amazing, our server, Ashley, was soooooo nice and very attentive. I really enjoyed my first time eating here!"}
{"text":"I had been here for a several times . I love their biscuit , pork ribs , smoke chicken . Everytime my drink have to be strawberry lemonade. And service are great .  They are not too far from our house . We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had. The rib tips are awesome. And the tri tip salad is a must. They have a great variety of southern style cocktails. However, service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ.  Great Southern treats.  Yummy biscuits and Apple Butter!

Now the reasons you may want to reconsider:

-- Extreme Portions.  This may be a good thing for some, but I found myself feeling very wasteful about half-way through the meal.  There was simply no way I was going to finish, and since I was planning to walk around the Marketplace afterwords - I knew the food wouldn't keep.

-- Extreme Prices.  We dropped in with the kids, because we thought it would be family friendly and moderately priced.  Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu.  All the entree's were $20+  Even kids meals were $8 dollars... better mortgage the house if you want to get drinks too!

-- Better Options.  Yes, this place is great.  But for the price, I could find comparable spots to eat.  The main advantage to Lucille's is that it is barbecue in the right location (Tempe Marketplace)."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is so flavorful!

The biscuits are all sugary and fluffy, never burnt. The drinks are HUGE and my favorite is the icedtea/lemonade, its so sweet! My favorite lunch is the chicken & tri tip, and I was so happy when they started putting the mop sauce on the side, then I could dip my fries into it. And they give you warm towels afterwards so your hands aren't all sticky. The servers are really kind and friendly and usually quick to fix an order if there's a mistake.

Best place for barbecue, hands down."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, I grew up in the Midwest, but this is the best BBQ I've ever had. The tri tip sandwich is my favorite so far. The service is always good too, tonight we had Kim and she was great!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was amazing. Alfonso was our server and I realized halfway through our meal that he was the best waiter I've ever had at any restaurant. Period. He was helpful, checking in a lot but not smothering. Very happy and welcoming and Had great tips when choosing our meals and very very prompt with refills and the biscuits. Really appreciated him making our night out great."}
{"text":"The biscuits were the main reason we came! And they didn't let me down! They were great. I did also get the BBQ salad, which was rather large! The one area for improvement was the lack of BBQ sauce, but maybe that is what made it healthy. But if you're looking for a large salad, this is the one!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of bbq, so this isn't my place. However, all the GUYS I know LOVE this place. Everyone always says both the pork and beef ribs are awesome. I do love the biscuits and apple butter!"}
{"text":"The St. Louis ribs were very tasty, the chicken juicy and flavorful. Loved the peanut slaw , mac and cheese and collard greens were great! Truly enjoyable meal. We will be back! Oh! also the apple cinnamon butter is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Always consistent good bbq.  Tri-tip is always quality and brazed green side dish is excellent!  If it's packed look for an empty booth or table in the bar area. They are first come first serve there."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here Saturday night when the craving struck. We didn't have a reservation but were able to phone ahead. I would certainly recommend a reservation or phoning ahead because there were people waiting 45 minutes plus at both the casino and exterior entrances. 
There was live music which was nice but noisy for us. Our server was friendly although obviously quite busy. 
I ordered a platter with pulled pork, smoked chicken, and rib tips. Gotta try them all right. Sides were coleslaw and greens. I did not enjoy the rib tips, they were quite tough. Chicken was moist and tasty but the pulled pork was definitely the stand out. Coleslaw was good but the greens were a little too salty.
My husband ordered the brisket with bbq beans and Mac and cheese. He felt the brisket was too lean and not tender enough. He loved both the Mac and cheese and the beans. I tasted the beans and would certainly order them again. 
I would try this place again, most likely when fiending for a pulled pork sandwich. Still searching for great ribs though..."}
{"text":"I love Lucille's. Generally, I am not a big fan of any kind of chain restaurant. But I will make an exception.

I've been three times, and the food and service were consistently very good. Once, I ate by myself in the bar, which I think may be a test of a restaurant, as sometimes solo diners are ignored or even disdained. The server, Kim, was especially attentive and made sure that I had everything I could possibly need or want. It would have been a perfect meal if not for the diners at the table across from me, three men who were having a conversation that would have been better left unsaid, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Frequently visit this establishment as the food is usually a 10/10. I recommend Lucile's to most anyone looking for a decent BBQ spot. Pretty good lunch menu and rarely a long wait for a table in my experience."}
{"text":"So happy they opened this at Red Rock! Food was great! Service was good! They just opened last week and you can tell they are still working the kinks out. Will be back, hopefully they will have it more together then."}
{"text":"Every time I eat at Lucille's I have a blast. The food here is amazing and very filling (I have a big appetite and their portions are huge; always fill me up). I can't think of any other place that serves such delicious baby back ribs (and garlic mashed potatoes!!!). In addition, Ashley our server was great! She made our dining experience fun and treated us very well! Hope to visit again soon and hopefully have Ashley serve our table again!"}
{"text":"It had been some time since last eating at Lucille's in Henderson. With so many new and better restaurants coming into the surrounding area, we just stopped going to them. But just recently we had decided to try their happy hour, and for the most part it was not too bad, and the cost was very reasonable. So we tried their takeout, and it was not very good. To give them another chance, we tried it again... both times was very poor. The meat selections were overcooked, and dried out.. terrible tasting. It's like they really don't care if it's beyond the point where it should be sold to a customer, and that's not a good policy for ANY establishment. Burned again and again (NPI).. we're now through with them."}
{"text":"Tri-tip is out of this world!  Son loves the beef ribs. Sides are killer, love the greens especially."}
{"text":"YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ANY DISH at Lucille's unless you are on a restricted diet. Coming from the east coast, it's been hard to find some great soul and southern style places to eat.  And Lucille's has fit the bill. She has become a permanent part of my staple food.  Every time I've gone there, I always walk away happy.  The ice tea is sweet and goes with everything. And it even comes in this glass drinking jar that makes drinking tea so much more fun and refreshing.  Lucille has become a definite stop when family and friends are in town.  It's a treat to see them marvel at how good the food is and serves as a good reason for them to come back.

Trust me cause I'm a picky eater!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. Staff was friendly and helpful. Food was very good and fast. Well definitely return again!"}
{"text":"After the excruciating four hour long Barrett Honors College convocation ceremony my parents took me (new graduate) and my boyfriend out for celebratory BBQ. My dad talked Lucille's up like it was better than Pappy's in St. Louis. He raved about the biscuits, the ribs, and the apple butter for days before we attended my ceremony, and I was really excited to try the food. Disappointment does not even begin to describe our experience.

The restaurant was relatively empty at the time of our visit. The hostess sat us at a table that could, possibly, have doubled as the freezer. The AC was turned way to low on a relatively cool evening, and I was shivering throughout my entire meal. I know that this isn't the hostess' or the waitress' fault, but my mom asked several times if they could turn up the AC or move us. 

The food was terrible. I ordered a full rack of ribs for $26.99 and they were burnt to high hell. Paired with the AC, my whole plate was cold in five minutes flat. I ordered Mac and Cheese as both of my sides and that was decent. My parents also split a burnt full rack of ribs, and my boyfriend had an average tasting pulled pork sandwich. We were served terrible quality food for the pricing of this restaurant. 

Our waitress was really nice, but I think she should have noticed how burnt the food was that she served us. I understand that we visited the restaurant at 9:20pm on a Wednesday evening, but their website showed that they take reservations all the way until 9:30pm. It is just really unfortunate that this establishment doesn't take more pride in their product. People go to restaurants on memory making occasions, and a bad dinner can ruin a good moment. Lucille's would do better to remember that in the future. 

TL;DR Burnt food, terrible for the price, will ruin your graduation experience."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had.  I've been to the one in CA and the one in Tempe. I felt the Tempe location had more tender meat.  Their strawberry lemonade is delicious.   One of my friends had ribs which he said was extremely good and the meat fell right off the bone.  I had the brisket and tritops which were out of this world."}
{"text":"Always tasty, always fresh ( get that bread) and the burnt ends are so yummy, they melt in your mouth.  We always have a good time at Lucille's!"}
{"text":"Lucille's has great service and great food! It's pricey thought, about 50$ for 2 people w/ alcoholic drinks included. But I think it's deffinetly worth it. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I don't claim to be an expert on good BBQ.  In fact, I didn't eat much of it until I married my husband, a southern boy.  I've since learned what I like and Lucille's is not it.

We stopped in for lunch while running an errand at Marketplace.  First, the lemonade.  I have a sweet tooth, but this was ridiculous.  Does the owner have stock in C&H?    It was very tasty once it had watered down by the end of my meal.  Next, biscuits.  Tasty and doubles as a hand grenade it you attempt to split it open.  Fried green tomatoes.  Not bad, but could have been called \"name that vegetable.\"  Kind of bland.  Potato salad.  I love a good potato salad.  I didn't have one yesterday.  Way too much dressing.  Maybe the same person that controls the sugar in the lemonade prepares the potato salad.  I shouldn't be able to eat just the potatoes and have enough dressing left in the bowl for another salad.

Finally, the BBQ.  I had the pulled pork sliders.  I made the mistake of assuming the pork was served dry as there was sauce on the table.  Wrong.  Okay, I can live with that.  On a positive note, the sauce was sweet and spicy and carmelized nicely.  But, it completely overpowered the meat.  What I really didn't like was the big globs of fat in every slider.  There's not much meat in a slider as it is.  Maybe that's why they call it a \"slider.\"  The fat just slides down your throat. 

Since everyone has a different idea of what makes good BBQ, I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying it.  I do highly suggest lunch rather than dinner as a starting point.  We payed half as much for me to determine I'm not interested in coming back.  What about dessert you ask? Just have the lemonade."}
{"text":"I love Lucille's because it reminds me of the South, where I moved here from. I will say that lunch is a bit pricey and pretty much the same menu with the exception of a few specials so really you could just go at dinner. Also at lunch you really have to ask for more biscuits if you want them and they brought them one per person at a time. I love the atmosphere and the Memphis bbq sauce."}
{"text":"I love coming to Lucile's. It reminds me of a real southern BBQ. Everything we get is delicious. The location is great too. We like ordering to go and then walking over to the splash pad in the summer and letting the kids play. The shopping in The District is an extra bonus."}
{"text":"No waiting in bar area for lunch. Ordered the beef brisket sandwich and potato salad and sweet tea. 
Sandwich was hot and shredded brisket was lean and tasty. Comes with very ligght sauce so you can adjust it to your taste with the 3 tabletop BBQ sauces.
Great side order options, try thre potato salad and mac  n cheese,. Definately upper end BBQ joint with medium to upper end prices and worth it."}
{"text":"There is BBQ and there is BBQ at Lucille's.  They get it done right.  Beef Ribs are big and juicy.  St Louis Ribs flavor is spot on.  Brisket is killer.  Unsung hero is the hot link.  Take a bite then seconds later you get the heat.  I can go on about the sides but let's be honest folks...it's all about the Meat!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here at least a half dozen times and always have a good meal from the cajun to the ribs it is all good.  Very kid friendly if that matters to you."}
{"text":"I often come here because my parents gamble here and we like to eat here often. Usually when we come here the food is always good and the service as well. But when I  came yesterday the service was bad. The server that took  care of us was bad.   We asked for regular butter because I'm allergic to the Apple butter she did not bring the regular butter,  They weren't really that busy she took 15 minutes to bring out the bread.  My boyfriend told her about the butter towards the end.  She was all like its okay.  But the people the people that came after us she took better care of them.  Everything came out fast for them
I had to get up and asked for the check.  We had to ask for the hot towels she was rude about that.  Asked for the boxes twice. The server's name is Holly"}
{"text":"If you're trying to have a group of people come to this place, I suggest you stay away. Staff seems to get really overwhelmed (including the managers) and are super snobby. Our waitress was Kayla & she had a hickie on her neck and was extremely rude with everyone. She gave my drink to someone else, so I waited almost an hour for a coke. She would ask the rest of my table if they wanted a refill and would not bring the refills... I had to go in and get them myself. The food was tasteless and overpriced. We stressed to them that we needed to leave by 1:40 and they were very rude about it and we're still here waiting for our cards back to leave. Horrible... I won't ever come here again.. staff and the food SUCKED. (It was my first time coming here and it will definitely be my last)"}
{"text":"The best lemonade and drinks. Food is delicious. Amazing BBQ, amazing flavor. Izzy our server did an amazing job, great service. Felt like real southern hospitality. Loved everything."}
{"text":"My Fiancé and I love this place. The food is great! We never leave disappointed. We come here often enough to know when they will be busy or not. The place is packed on the weekends, so I suggest going during the week. Just like every restaurant if you have all the tables in the house full, you're going to get your meal a little slower than usual. They can't help that. But they are definitely on our top 10 list. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. I usually go to the one in Long Beach since it is near my house. However, the atmosphere is more charming at this location. It really has that Blues/BBQ feel to it which is really pleasing to the eye. If you are entering from the casino you have to walk threw the restaurant to get to the main entrance. The staff was all very welcoming and friendly. We had a great server named Kimberly she was very friendly and helpful. My partner was recovering from a night of partying and she knew just the beverage/trick to help him get going again. As always the food was delicious I recommend the watermelon Ice tea and the Fried pickles appetizer they are so yummy."}
{"text":"2 words come to mind every time I think about this place. Grilled Artichoke!
Dear God, I never knew a vegetable could taste so good. This is not the steamed,
flavorless, drenched in mayo, artichoke that your mother may or may not 
have tortured you with as a child, even if you thought you liked it at the 
time.. This is the king of all artichokes, Artichoke superhero. 
Saving the world one delightful leaf at a time ;)
I live on the complete other side of the valley from this place and while they
do have some good barbecue, great tea, and awesome biscuits, somehow my wife and I find ourselves making the 45 minute drive (light traffic) to get a vegetable. As a meatatarian you can imagine my horror/chagrin/embarrassment at the situation.. somehow reminding myself that I am going to a barbecue joint doesnt ease the odd feeling.. I KNOW why I am going there and it ain't the ribs. (sorry Lucille) 
They do serve it with a dipping sauce but the buttery and smokey flavor really just 
set it off right .. 
I cant remember if I even eat the dipping sauce. I can just picture licking the smokey flavor off my fingers afterwards.. 
My wife absolutely WILL NOT share this appetizer with me and we have to each order 
our own. As a Chef I've tried many times to duplicate this recipe in my own 
kitchen and while I have come close, it's never quite the same.. So after many,
many tries I've resigned myself to the fact that we will be forced to drive 
across town for the best damn Artichoke I've ever had."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, fabulous food and great service. One of my favorite places in town."}
{"text":"As someone who currently doesn't eat meat or dairy, I was prepared for this to be a challenge when an in-law chose this as her birthday dinner spot.  The salads are all full of meat and cheese, but I found a garden burger!  Just had to ask for no cheese or mayo. They dress the greens on it with a balsamic dressing that was a little too heavy-handed, but overall the \"burger\" was good. It must be cooked in close proximity to meat, because it had a smoky grilled flavor.  I actually broke it apart to make sure it wasn't meat!  My side was sweet potato fries, which were a nice portion and not over cooked.  I dipped my burger in all three of their barbecue sauces... the spicy one is spicy!!  My favorite was the Memphis style.  It was tangy and seasoned well.  The original was pretty bland in my opinion, and a little too thick and goopy.  
This is a pretty large restaurant and lives up to chain restaurant stereotypes... Pretty standard menu, odd decor, decent food, decent service.  Don't go here looking for culinary greatness, go here for decent barbecue, and you'll be fine.  ;-)"}
{"text":"First off, the four stars is for the food here.  Very close to five stars.  The service though is a a three at best.  Seems like we have been consistently ignored, long waits to see our server, order mistakes and other annoyances.  That being said, the food is so good I keep coming back!  Feed me that BBQ goodness!

Recently came for lunch and they have a good lunch menu, again, service was awful.  Waited too long to see our server, another 10 minutes passed between drink order and food (they weren't busy) and they brought our orders out separately.   Again, food was bomb though lol.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and almost made love to the second half."}
{"text":"Expected a lot more from this place especially given the high prices. Met a friend for lunch and she picked this restaurant. Had time to look at the menu before she got there and was a bit shocked at the prices. Half a rack of ribs at $25. They were good but not all that. The greens were tasty, the mashed potatoes dry. I did like the cornbread a lot. My friend raved about the cheese grits. I like them too. Our appetizer took forever. Found out they went to the wrong table before our waitress ever bothered to figure that out when we asked twice if it was still coming. Good customer service because the manager brought a fresh sausage Trio appetizer and comped it. I'd be willing to try this place again but it's not on the top of my list"}
{"text":"Got the rib tips and was not impressed at all.  The meat was bland and the sauce, what sauce!!  I won't order them again.  My husband had the beef ribs and he too was not impressed."}
{"text":"Fantastic smokehouse BBQ! Big portions, delicious meats, fresh baked bread, live music on the weekends - a fun place to spend with family and friends. Not to mention I'm a huge fan of any place that serves drinks in mason or ball jars. 

Sit in the bar and watch the game or hang your hat and sit in the diner on the seriously comfortable booths. Buy some BBQ to take home on your way home."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. The hostess gave me a table by an open window.  It was cold and I finally asked to be moved. The waitress didn't bother to move my drinks nor food. No utensils were provided , so me and my friend just left."}
{"text":"Food was great. But the customer service here is awesome.  Quevera, my waitress. Was attentive. Nothing compared to the horrible service at the one in red rock casino.  I'm defiantly coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a excellent \"first date spot\" filled with great and affordable food and drinks."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here!  I had the burnt ends beef brisket salad & it was great!  The kids meals are a good value - my son had the ribs & couldn't finish them."}
{"text":"Great food! The food was warm and delicious. Our lady server was kind and generous. She would refill our cups with out being asked. Except for the male server on the side of us making discriminating gestures about Mexican's. That was very upsetting and I really wanted my food to go, Las Vegas is very diverse and there is no room for that behavior. Once we started to ignore him the experience was wonderful."}
{"text":"Me and some of the boys were feeling like ribs after seeing Sweeney Todd.. yeah we're sick like that.. would have preferred meat pies.. ANYHOO.. got there during lunch time.. I'm not a fan of the whole corporate shtick and this place is well.. all shtick.. from the 'leg lamp' to the bottle caps glued on the wall this place is actually more kitsch and not in a good way. I would like to say though that the chair I sat in was SO comfortable that I could sit and stare at all the crap on the walls for hours. I mean seriously, there is tons of stuff on the walls there, dizzying. 

Being the adventurous one, ordered the fried pickles.. ya know you had to order at least once to say you tried them.. well, I wouldn't order those again.. let's just say I like my pickles firm! I ordered the trip tip salad for my lunch.. not much to say about it.. it was what it was.. overly sweet bbq ranch dressing with a few pieces of tri tip (was very tender) all covered in cubes of cheese. In fact none of us even ordered the ribs *sigh*. 

The service was super slow though food is priced well and the portions very large. Typical corporate experience not to good, not to bad just ho hum.. will probably not return. Prefer Joe's BBQ for the time being."}
{"text":"Nice BBQ here at Red Rock casino and resort Las Vegas. And service is good too. And we got family set that big and we take some to go. Lol"}
{"text":"Decent food, but high prices...

The food is not bad here but it is a bit expensive for what it is... All that can really be said is that it is not great or bad... Just alright and not special...."}
{"text":"Tried Lucille's for lunch. The service was prompt and the server was friendly. Between the two of us we had the Baby Back Ribs. Pulled Pork, Hot Link and a Chicken Breast. The sides were coleslaw and mashed potatoes. Both sides were good.
The ribs, pulled pork and chicken were tasty with the right amount of sauce and not too much smoke. The hot link was nothing special. I did encounter 2 pieces of fat in the hot link. 

My biggest surprise was the size of the rib bones. I have never seen rib bones that were as short as Lucille's.  I consider myself a student of BBQ, an avid backyard smoker and have had ribs all over the USA from Memphis in May to the Reno BBQ Fest. These were miniature bones. I asked the server why the bones were so short and if an entire slab would have all short bones. She did not know but was willing to ask the manager. The manager's answer was that pigs come in all sizes???
There are other restaurants in Las Vegas that serve better BBQ and at a lower price point. In summary, Lucille's is just OK"}
{"text":"Pork ribs were ok. Nothing special stand out though. The place is pretty nice though. The restaurant is huge and has a friendly atmosphere. Their  biscuits were pretty good."}
{"text":"Since I've recently resigned myself to chain bbq, I thought I'd give Lucille's a try, even though it's not in my neighborhood.  I didn't care for it. We went for lunch and the hostess was friendly and the room seemed comfortable. After a very short wait we were taken to a table right next to a large table with several small children. I quietly asked not to be seated right next to little children and said any of the other tables on the other side of the room would be fine. The young man seating us had a short conversation over his headset and said that none of the other tables had waiters. I asked again and after another headset conversation we were seated at one of the farther tables. Our waiter was friendly, took our orders etc. I ordered a bbq platter that came with 3 st. louis ribs, two additional meats and a side. Biscuits and butter were served. The biscuits were dry and had a sprinkle of sugar on top. I don't like the sugar. When my food came, the \"3 ribs\" was the very end of a rack, the three tiny skinny bones ranging from about 1.5\" to about 3\" in length and very thin and dry. I asked the guy who brought my food if that was their idea of 3 ribs and he said yes. I asked my waiter if the tiny little piece of pork was indeed 3 ribs and he said, \"yes, that's three ribs, you got an end piece.\" I was not at all happy with their idea of three ribs. I was expecting three normal sized ribs. The manager was walking by, I got her attention. She asked me how my lunch was and I said horrible, that  I was not at all happy and I explained my disappointment with their idea of 3 ribs. She said she'd bring me some larger ribs. Once I was finished with the rest of my plate, she brought me a half order of baby back ribs saying she didn't want me to go hungry. I don't like baby back ribs which is why I ordered the st. louis ribs in the first place. The baby back ribs were over charred, dry and not very good. The Hot link I ordered would have been fine if it wasn't covered in sweet sticky sauce and the pulled pork was dry. The grits were awful, tasting of red bell pepper more than anything. My aunt liked her sandwich. The tables had three bottles of bbq sauce, an original, a spicy and a honey mustard (?). All three were very sweet.  I won't return."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Lucille's being just off the plane and needing to eat ASAP.  We were seated very quickly and our server was amazing.  One of my favorite parts of the trip was her saying, 'If you need me and I'm not available, you can get anyone, we're all a team here.'  This ensured we were taken care of the whole time!  She even brought out samplers of some of the sides we were interested in trying, free of charge!

We split a TON of appetizers and got entrees -- bad choice because the portions are HUGE, great choice because everything was so delicious!  

I tried the corn chowder and smoked chicken pasta.  The corn chowder was delicious, creamy and a sweet corn flavor.  The smoked chicken pasta was incredible; the sauce was creamy and delicious, the pasta was well-cooked but not soggy and the chicken was tender and melt in your mouth.

I had the Georgia Peach (or something of that nature!) cocktail which was delicious; and moderately priced for the size.  Very refreshing and delicious.  I didn't get to try it but Lucille's also brews there own beer which I'm sure would have been great!

Overall, I recommend this place; it was a pleasant surprise in our hotel!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome and one of my top two favorite BBQ restaurants all time.  Everything I have ever had hear, and it has been quite a few things, has been just amazing.  The only thing better than their BBQ has to be their sides.  I have honestly just ordered the mac-n-cheese and fries and been a happy campy.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"We visited here several years ago and remember that the food was so yummy that we purchased a bottle of their BBQ sauce to enjoy at home. We thought we'd give it another try on this visit.

We had 12 adults and one teenager in our group. We shared the Super Feast said to be good for 10 or more.  It came with \"Choice of three racks of baby back, St. Louis or beef ribs and four half BBQ chickens, with your choice of two pounds of two of the following; sausages, tri tip, pulled pork, rib tips or brisket burnt ends, a large tossed green salad, plus your choice of six sides. Served family-style.\" It was Yummy! The portions are very generous, we had enough leftover meat to fill a medium sized foil tray. 

They had several on table bottled sauces with different levels of spicy. Sauce on the food was thicker and drier (in a good way) than that of Armadillo Willie's and less tangy than that of Phil's; it was finger licking good.

Service was very good and always with a good attitude and a smile; refills of our drinks sometimes came before we asked.  We will come again during our next visit."}
{"text":"Went after 7pm on a Sunday. Even though there were a ton of tables open, seemed like there were a little understaffed on waiters, since we still had to wait 30 mins for a table. Was a little disappointing. 

The server we got out on the back patio was awesome though. Very attentive and able to customize our experience, since we had to leave quickly to catch a flight. Brought out boxes and check before we were done eating, without asking, once he knew we were in a rush. Thanks! 

Food was pretty good, but depends widely on what you got. The brisket here is their thing, and it was definitely the highlight of the mains we got.  Salad wasn't anything spectacular."}
{"text":"IMO - Take out should be as close to the dine-in experience as possible. 

We always order the Backyard Family Feast when we eat at Lucille's, but today was the first time ordering take out.  

They don't do multiple sauces and they don't give extra orders of biscuits.  Doesn't make sense to me."}
{"text":"My wife made a reservation on Father's Day - little did we know we'd have to still wait 45 minutes past our reservation time to get seated.  Fast forward to burnt nachos, cold grilled cheese and mac and cheese that literally had water pooled at the bottom of the bowl - and $64 later, thank you Lucilles!"}
{"text":"Back again, with a friend from the AU. Loved it!  The beef ribs are about the size of the ones on the Flintstones. Ok showing my age.
Everything was delish, again."}
{"text":"Delicious brisket sandwich! Went great with that huge glass of Guiness. Went on a night when they had a live blues band playing...fun night!"}
{"text":"AMAZING... From beginning to end everything was perfect. Silly me..i was walking up the stairs into the restaurant and i trip and fell and the staff came Immediately to help me and ask if i was ok. Once we were in the host and waitress were duper friendly and service was great. It wasn't a extremely busy night so our food came fast!! The food is amazing and biscuits mmmmm  the best of the best!!!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome.  The corn bread was really good.   My wife really liked the fact that drinks were served out of old mason jars.

We had the Smoked Chicken Quesadilla for an appetizer.  It was really delicious and lots of cheese and chicken.

We both had the BBQ Chicken Salad and it was huge!  It was really good.

My wife and I visited on a Friday night and this place was DEAD!  The service was SLOW!  We didn't get refills as much as we wanted and our waitress was missing more than half the time.

Since the food was great and the place is new, we didn't worry too much about it.  We expect service to improve with time."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place!  Prior to going did some research and it seemed to have had some positive reviews so we decided to check it out.  The biscuits they brought out were cold and too sweet.  I ordered the half chicken and memphis style ribs.  The chicken was not bad however the spare ribs were dry.  I had to use the cold BBQ sauce on the table to make them edible.  I got the French fries and coleslaw as my sides.  The cole slaw was typical.  The fries tasted like dirty oil.  The waitress was in a coma was rushing us to order and after the food finally came she was nowhere to be found.  Will never go back to this place again.  Total ripoff.  Could have eaten in much more elegant place with better food taste and quality."}
{"text":"This was 1 of the worst Bbq experiences I ever encountered besides famous Daves. The waiter recommended the beef tips and said the Brisket was juicy. Farther then the truth! It was horrible. The wait staff screwed up every order. The Caesar tasted like vomit. The Mac and cheese was like a dried brick. Nothing came out at the same time and this was a Birthday Celebration. The ribs tasted like they were yesterday's reheated. The patio was cold and drafty cuz they kept the rolled up plastic up all night. The list goes on and on and on. Save ur money from these big Bbq chains cuz they they can't deliver your money's worth. You will regret."}
{"text":"Lucille's is always delicious. It's our favorite BBQ restaurant. Especially the green valley location. Today we went in for lunch and had SARAH as our server. She wasn't even mediocre..it was terrible! 
Please see examples of the horrible service below:

1. One of our sweet teas had BBQ sauce INSIDE of the rim of the glass. Mind you we didn't even order our food yet, so there's absolutely no reason why we would have BBQ sauce in our drinks. When this was brought to SARAH'S attention she said \"oh, that's weird\". Didn't apologize.

2. After our food had been dropped off, she didn't bring any napkins..so we figure we ask her for some when she comes back to check on us. Funny thing is, she NEVER came back to check on us. One of the people from our group had to stand up, walk around the restaurant with BBQ all over his hands to ask another server for napkins.

3. Still no check in from our server. When we were done eating, we had to flag her down to ask for to-go boxes. She brought the boxes and the check without even asking how we enjoyed everything.she even tossed the boxes on top of food that we were going to take to go

4. The fastest service we did receive from her was when she came back for the check. She swiped the card, ran back and dropped the check presenter on the table.

No \"thank you\"'or any type of friendly acknowledgement. I believe she is in dire need of a retraining about what customer service is. She was the WORST server I've experienced in your establishment."}
{"text":"I have yet to find a decent BBQ place here in Las Vegas, at least none that even represent what I used to get in Texas.  I love the ambiance and decor of this place.  I thought I was in for a real treat.  Being from Texas, I judge my BBQ on the brisket.  First, it must not have sauce on it.  Sauce should be served on the side.  The brisket came out and it was drenched in sauce.  And I like my BBQ sauce on the sweet side, with a slight kick/slightly spicy.  The sauce that was on it was HOT!  And my mouth was on fire.  I had a miserable case of heartburn the rest of the day.  I couldn't tell how good or how bad the brisket was because of it.   It seemed to be tender.  I had the sweet potato mash with it, and it was ok, nothing special.  The worst part of it was that I had the brisket (which there wasn't very much of it), the sweet potato mash, and a beer and it was $23.  I could have had this same lunch in Central Texas and it would have been about $15 at the most and would have been much better.  The service isn't great either and the servers aren't overly friendly.  Needless to say, I haven't been back to Lucille's, nor do I have any plans to do so."}
{"text":"We eat here multiple times a month, even if it's just for biscuits and a salad and appetizer. One of our absolute favorite places to dine! For the most part, service is awesome, and the only time we have had a problem it was fixed immediately. We love variety of the menu, and customer service is always great! We will be back, as I'm always craving more Lucilles!"}
{"text":"Long time fan of Lucille's beef ribs and bloody mary's, in particular.  Their \"brontosaurus-sized\" beef ribs are layered in their house BBQ sauce and then smoked - imparting both a delicious taste and smell.  Bring your appetite, as these are hearty meals that leave you feeling very satisfied."}
{"text":"This is usually a pretty good place. The food is really good. I know it's not \"real southern BBQ\" but it is passable. Portions are good, quality is good. I will certainly come back.

Tonight though, was huge black eye on the otherwise typically good service. Roberto should be humiliated to call himself a server, and other servers should be offended that he shares their profession."}
{"text":"Michael is our server almost every time we come here and he is truly the nicest and sweetest guy! He is so great at recommending things and just chatting with you about any questions you have. He's so attentive and amazing! We just love seeing him when we come in, so much so we've written in and told the manager how pleased we are. Also, it is a greatly managed location. Love love their watermelon tea mixed with lemonade! Great food and always clean too!"}
{"text":"There are BBQ-purists whose ideal BBQ menu consists of one item: steak, preferably raw. Me, I wish these joints would branch out a bit, and that's what Lucille's does well. Besides the usual steak, smoked chicken, and burgers, they've got curly onion straws, a fantastic southern seafood section, fried chicken, jambalaya, and a great brisket sandwich. The iced tea and strawberry limeade are pretty great, too.

Setting is nice, and I do like the service. Friendly people, even on crowded peak times. One time, I was asking a server his opinion between two items on the menu. He leaned in to explain that, while management doesn't allow him to bash on anything, he really wouldn't recommend the (i forgot) here. That's the kind of genuine catering to customers that I love, and the kind of behavior that would get him fired."}
{"text":"We were there last night for a retirement party for a coworker.  Wonderful food and service as always and I have used this place for a few other parties in the past. The waiter and waitress that took care of our party were very good and came around to check on us quite often.  Some of the people in our party that had never been there before were very impressed with their food they ordered and said they would go back there on their own time.  I had the Louisiana Pasta, best pasta ever and our waiter recommended that to me a little spicy but that's cool it was still tasty."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm....barbeque.  When I come to Vegas, I generally hit this spot and get the combo with some brisket and ribs.  Never disappointed.  Beware though - while other buffets and restaurants are plying with you cheap food in an abundant quantity, Lucille's will give you good tasting food at a reasonable price and will pull you away from the strip.  Why is this bad you may ask?  Well, because there's no gambling there and if you're in Vegas, you may as well get your food 100 feet from a table game rather than 15 minutes from the strip.

But I will say this, when you come to Lucille's, bring your A-game or you won't finish your food.  And that makes you a wuss.  Yeah, you heard me, Chris."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite for dinner. I was traveling for work and have been here before. I was seated right away. The waitress was very friendly. She checked on me frequently and was very helpful. Food was great. I had the chicken sandwhich with sweet potato fries. Enjoyed a Sangria to drink. Food came out quickly and hot. Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"A week ago when my wife & I arrived in Vegas, this was the 1st place recommended by my niece & her husband who live here. Being the 'foodie' that I am, she made a reservation ahead of time.  OMG! Boy was she right. Never had baked bean that tasted like that. Astonishing! Fried chicken breast & gravy...Amazing. We were a party of 8. We all order different things and shared. The only thing that was neither here nor there was the onion straws. Brisket, sausage, chicken (roasted&fried) ribs, brisket, cornbread all were TERRIFIC! Definitely recommend! Delicious! No question will be back. We're back in Vegas b4 we leave. Yummm! Servers were awesome too! This is how you eat while on vacation!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here numerous times and it is always great. This past time superseded all other expectations the food was phenomenal and the service as well. We sat at the bar for quicker service and Josh and Collin helped us out and they were attentive, and knowledgeable. A+"}
{"text":"In a word... underwhelmed. I came in here with high expectations, though, so it's not really fair.

The portion sizes were massive, the drinks were good... but I was definitely underwhelmed by the quality of the BBQ... to the point that I didn't finish my meal, and it wasn't because I wasn't hungry.

Maybe I hit this place on an off day. It's worth eating at, but I don't get the hype of the \"OHHHHH MY GOD I CAME MYSELF FROM EATING HERE.\""}
{"text":"I am here on business and found this place for lunch.  It has a diner feel to it and a very cool atmosphere/ambiance.

Great service (they do team service at this restaurant) even though it was a very busy lunch crowd.  The food is plentiful.  I ordered a lunch special and it was a big plate of food, enough for 2 people easily.

The food is great.  I had chicken and pulled pork.  We also had the fried pickles which are excellent.  They do fried pickle spears here.  In other places I've only had pickle chips.

I didn't care for their regular unsweetened iced tea.  It had an odd/off flavor to it.

Other than that, a good solid lunch place."}
{"text":"We used to love Lucille's until today. We love the barbecue, music and bar area for happy hour and Saturday night live blues. Today we went for lunch and the food was not so good. As I entered I asked the hostess for a booth by window so I could spot my wife as she arrived after me. I was put way in the back instead, oh well. The service was prompt maybe a little too prompt. Deviled eggs for an appetizer. Nothing special and on the watery side. She had stuffed baked potato with brisket. Not too much stuffing. I had barbecue chicken salad that was just ok. Chicken was tasteless but barbecue sauce was good. Perhaps I'll just drink the sauce the next time."}
{"text":"Atrocious service. Came in at about 1:30 on a Saturday. The place was busy but lots of empty tables. We were seated and waited for someone to come and take our drink order for at least ten minutes. No one showed, so I went to the hostess stand and asked if the server knew we were there since no one had come by yet. Shortly afterward, a manager came over, told us how great their service is and how they work as a team and then took our order. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. Usually one of the best things about a bbq restaurant is that the food comes out quickly. Not here! It was at least a half hour before we got our food, sans one side that wasn't ready yet. We finished eating and then had to wait again for a to go box and our check. (Server was oblivious and never looked our way so we could get his attention.) And by the way, the prices are sky high. Especially for BBQ, though the food was pretty good. Biscuits were delicious. Kind of a cross between a scone and biscuit...a little sweet."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place right in the Red Rocks Casino. Parking is shared with the casino so there's plenty of it.
The restaurant itself is pretty big. Booths, tables and high tops were all available as far as seating. There is also a bar and I'm pretty sure you can order food at the bar as well. 
I was there for an early dinner on a Monday it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. Menus were dropped off and our server was at our table almost right away with drink orders. 
The food was very good. I had the Smokehouse BBQ Burger with fries as a side though you can have other options, like veggies or a baked potato. The burger was huge too, I had to cut it in half which for me is always a good sign. The burnt ends were delicious as well which came with a piece of watermelon too. Three types of BBQ sauce right at the table. They have their own brand. I didn't try all three but the hot option was pretty good. 
This place isn't anywhere near the strip but it is and was definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I love Lucile's . Quality food and quality customer service ! Zach helped us a lot when choosing what we wanted to eat . He was knowledgeable and informative and I appreciated his recommendations!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best,..the smoked ribs and chicken were ok (yes, just ok)...the biscuits were worst I've ever experienced.  Garlic mash potatoes were worse I've EVER eaten. I haven't \"a clue\" how this place has gotten such good reviews,...BLOWS my mind! Would not eat here again even if it were free."}
{"text":"Lucille's is the best i almost always get the same thing, their fried chx dinner (heavenly), today i branched out I had their Tennessee's hot fried chx with sweet pickles mac and cheese and potato salad, these chx breast were huge!! U was only able to finish one. U also enjoyed their hop lovers beer flight, a few local brews, lumberyard pinetop, one from Huss, Sculpin, and Deschuttes fresh squeezed. No complaints here!! We showed up about an hour before the closed and still enjoyed friendly prompt service."}
{"text":"Love this place! The entire staff is always friendly, their tri tip is amazing and their biscuits can't be beat. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. I liked it a lot. Could be kind of pricey though.

Our server first got us started with some biscuits and this apple butter spread. The butter was different and tasted amazing. We ordered a spinach and cheese dip and burnt ends for appetizer. The spinach dip was as mediocre as it could get. Came with plenty of chips. The burnt ends were good, some pieces were alittle fatty. But I liked it. 

For my meal I had the rack of ribs full order with a side of mash potatoes and macaroni and cheese. Sides were pretty good as were the ribs. Plenty of meat too. You probably don't even need the full rack, the half would have been perfect for me. Sauce on the ribs was just right, not too tangy or sweet. I like the bbq sauces at the table too.

I tried the sausage and the tritips. Both good, sausage alittle spicy. But liked my ribs the best. 

We got too full for dessert and had alot of leftovers. Server was nice and friendly. I liked the warm towels at the end. Will definitely come back when I am in Vegas. I'm not much of a BBQ fanatic if that means anything."}
{"text":"Bammmmmmmmmmmmb gets no better me and the wife went today for lunch and it was amazing smoking hot so much flavor seriously to die for you must go. To top it off it wasnt even bbq that we ordered and of course we got some sweet tea and peach cobbler to goyou must go great environment and location with amazing works of art throughout and family pictures......good staff members and very friendly"}
{"text":"Have you ever just craved meat? I mean meat fest? Man, I get these cravings from time to time. For some reason I really wanted to have BBQ, real BBQ, just a hunkering for sweet meat. I remember that I had eaten at Lucille's in Cerritos and wondered if they had one in Vegas. When I found out there was one in Henderson I was licking my chops. 

I had the Back Porch. This consists of half a chicken, tri tip and ribs. I got the beef ribs. The trip tip was awesome, just wish there was more of it. The half chicken was not my speed. It was just too much meat and well it was chicken. Now, the ribs, AMAZING. So juicy, moist and delectable. I kept chewing on the ribs like a dog they were so good. The sides were great too, really creamy coleslaw and awesome potato salad. Sweet tea could have been sweeter but was fine by me. 

The Memphis sauce was awesome. I just needed this meat fix and boy I was happy I got it."}
{"text":"Tasty meat....had I got my meal all at once I would have given more stars. We started with the sampler appetizers and was surprised that EVERYTHING was delicious! We ordered drinks and our food and after waiting for about 30-40 minutes three of us got half of our meal and the fourth person got their whole order. We were told that our side dishes would be out shortly so we began to eat. Our waiter never checked on if our sides came so I stopped him and reminded him that we hadn't received them yet...so we finish our meat and Reno (our server) comes and asks if we wanted dessert or our check? I say if like our check but we never received what we ordered. When he realizes what happens he look a bit embarrassed and apologizes and says that he will go speak to his manager. He comes back and the manager took $10 off our bill. I will go back at least once more in hopes that it was an off night. On this occasion out experience started off great, better than we expected and gradually went down from there."}
{"text":"Sweat ice tea was old. Tasted flat.  Biscuits were dry. Apple butter was good though.  Ribs are really dry and over cooked. Baked potato was warm. Took forever for the butter to melt  Mac & cheese was good.  Won't be coming  back."}
{"text":"I'm surprised they don't have a higher rating. My brother suggested Lucille's for family dinner, and I'm glad he did. Though he requested we be seated in the bar area for happy hour, we weren't. When I requested the happy hour menu, our server said we had to move tables. No worries. We were handed off to Brett, who had a great sense of humor. He gave my Mom a hard time about being hangry and shooting him the stank face as he offered us the special. I went with the brisket nachos and a lemonade. The lemonade was awesome, as were the nachos (I cleaned my plate!). I had a bite of hubby's bacon and cheddar mac and cheese, but I didn't love it. I do like that they give you hot towels rather than moist towelettes. I didn't really need it, but those in our fam that got meatier meals were pleased with them and were able to clean their faces. The biscuits were really good as well, but a little bit too crumbly as it kept falling apart as I tried to cut it. I skipped dessert in favor of the biscuit. You can enter through the parking lot and skip the walk through the casino. Definitely good for a chain restaurant. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had the family over for Christmas Eve, after all the church services and shopping and parties we found ourselves without a food plan for our family. I've been to Lucille's BBQ before and I knew i loved there beef ribs. So I ordered the super feast. There is 8 of us and it said it serves 10. Well let me tell you I could have served 20. 3 racks of ribs 4 pounds if select meats and so many sides plus salad and biscuits. The family loved it! Even the kids and ours our picky. We had enough to send everyone home with a nice take home portion of all . I wouldn't hesitate to order this again. Yum yum"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and it was OK. The poor waitress had too many tables to cover and the customers did suffer long waits on the drinks. The chicken was absolutely wonderful and the sausage appetizer was yummy. Their Lucille's IPA was also delish."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here imo.  Been here twice now. Had pork sandwich and jambalaya.  Both were good. Jambalaya was very spicy...be careful if you dont like spicy. Skinny margarita was excellent. And their honey blonde lage is also tasty. Only bad part was the fire alarm went off during our meal. It was extremely annoying. After asking several employees about it including a manager, they nonchalantly said it was the hotel and they couldn't do anything about. It was a little frustrating no sympathy, no apologies, just an oh well it happens all the time type attitude.

UPDATE: The owner reached out to me regarding my experience. He was understanding and will be reviewing the training practices for the employees for situations like this in the future. Excellent follow up and glad to know my opinion does count.  Thanks Brad."}
{"text":"I finally discovered Lucille's last year and was thrilled when I found out they were opening in Red Rock - no more 30 minute drive. Got a free night and went late. It wasn't busy and I was surprised on how big it was , our waitress was Wendy and she was so nice,informative, helpful and offered us a tea to go- bf was happy ! Didn't think we'd have a bad experience but knowing restaurants that just open wasn't sure ... But it was great and of course the food never disappoints. Just wish I could make it to dessert.. Will probably be back on the weekly. Only down was the hostess were confused on reservations and got it mixed up but no biggie"}
{"text":"I had the burnt ends and the sausage. both were very good. Loved them. Then i ordered my meal. Asked for Wet Brisket and they did not know what I was talking about. So i got more burnt ends and lean brisket along with some ribs. I asked the server what ribs were the best. She named one so i said cool. Well the lean brisket was so dry and the ribs were tough. So not that impress with the place. Burnt ends good. the rest was not."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to gamble and eat BBQ and this place had it all! My GF from vegas took me here. It's a BBQ restaurant connected to Red Rock Casino. Inside was jumping with live music and large TV displays and decorated with a western theme with large wooden booths and tables. 

We were seated promptly however it did take a long time for the waiter to acknowledge us we needed to flag someone down to take our order I had to minus a star. After that the service was better and the food was amazing. 

The half portion of the appetizer platter was perfect for the 3 of us Pork Rib tips,  fried dill pickles, sweet potato fries, fried green tomatoes, egg rolls,  fried okra,  chicken strip and hot links. It was all very tasty and perfect if you want to try various things. 

We ordered BBQ shrimp, beef brisket and a bbq rib combo platter.  It came with choices of sides. I had the sweet potato fries which was awesome perfectly crunchy and seasoned I'm the outside and sweet and soft on the inside. The brisket was very tasty and you can tell that they have their own smoker in house and they smoke it there.  The ribs were amazing too! For a restaurant attached to a casino I was very impressed. The complimentary biscuits that they serve are deliciously homemade and I had to stop myself from eating too much. Unfortunately unable to try a dessert I was too full from dinner. Highly recommended, the BBQ was really good and those bisquits and sweet potato fries were winners!"}
{"text":"We did take out! 
Customer service was phenomenal no doubt. My ordered was delightfully placed and was offered biscuts, BBQ sauce and cutlery; which is great!! Upon pick up my husband was very satisfied with the service. 

Now the food was below average. Biscuts were bland even with the cinnamon butter that was provided. The BBQ pulled pork sandwhich was okay, nothing extrodinary. The mashed potatoes did not taste garlicy. They were just regular potatoes to me. My husband got the 2 meat combo and 2 sides. He got the ribs and 1/2 chicken. They tasted just okay nothing special about them. The sides truly need some work. He got the mac n cheese and BBQ beans. Again nothing we were in ahhh about."}
{"text":"I am a Famous Dave's place through and through! But this place has the best service and way good food! I will go back over any place any day!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here! Place is clean staff was super nice and I like that thee is parking right outside of it. the biscuits with the sweet butter at the beginning oh my gosh delicious! I consider this place alittle pricey but don't get me wrong the food is good and the portions are filling. We had a full rack of baby back ribs that I do think could have been alittle more tender, but still had a really good flavor. The pulled pork was yummy it was moist and very little fat. The burnt brisket ends had alittle more fat on them then I'd usually prefer but they also were tasty! For sides we got the Mac and cheese, corn on the cob, garlic mashed, and sweet potato fries and I'd highly recommend them all! With my meal I had a cucumber vodka drink that was amazing! So refreshing and I'm not even a huge fan of cucumber but it was made really well. I look forward to coming back here and trying some other things."}
{"text":"Happy Valentine's Day to me!  I've visited Lucille's a few times years ago, but I haven't been recently. We came here for V Day and the food was out of this world. They completely revamped the menu. Biscuits tasted like Betty Crocker was in the kitchen, garlic bread to die for, and they have this new breaded fried chicken with gravy. Holy moly, reminded me of chicken fried steak, it was AH-MAZING! Almost all the side dishes were excellent. Although I wouldn't get the garlic mashed potatoes again. Not bad at all, but they could be better I guess. 

Is it pricey? Um, plates run about $30-35 for the meat dishes. Appetizers are a bit on the pricey end up around $9-15. But it is SO worth it! 

A+++ Service!!! Our waitress was excellent. She could of not done a better job."}
{"text":"Loved loved their customer service! They were so friendly as soon as we walked in. Everyone was so pleasant including the manager that also stopped by our table to make sure we were doing okay. It was my first time here so the waiter was patient with me, because i had questions about their menu. They bring out rolls with a delicious butter that i could have ate a dozen of those, but i was good and didn't lol 
The entree was delicious and a huge portion that i was able to take home and eat for lunch the next day! I look forward to coming back and trying something else."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, why is this place 3 stars?? This food is RIDICULOUS! It is so frigging good!!! I am in Phoenix for work and I'm at  a hotel so I can't give it 5 stars because I had it delivered to my room. I'm lazy and I don't want to look like a crazy loser eating alone. But the advantage is that is can pig the hell out without anyone seeing me!!! I am normally not a biscuit fan. Holy cow. These biscuits with their wonderful pal Mr. Apple Butter have made me a believer. The greens, while not as good as mine, were tremendously better than I expected. The rib tips. Damn. I am going to gain some major lb's tonight but it will be worth it. I feel like I've died and gone to hog heaven, literally."}
{"text":"Could have been a five star review and probably will be on my next visit, but 4 for now. The reasons for the lost of a star are the air conditioning is super cold in there. Not normally a problem, but there doesn't  seem to be any spots in the back dining room to escape the AC. This is a problem, because the food gets cold quickly once it hits the table. The 2nd issue was the Baby back ribs were a little on the dry side. Good flavor, but maybe just a little well done.
With that out of the way, this was still a positive 4 star experience. 
Service was something to be seen in person. Great model of how to service your guest. Ordered the sample appetizer platter. The tri tips were outstanding! As well as every item on the platter. 
The entree was the 2 meat combo. It included the already mentioned baby back ribs and Brisket. The Brisket was top notch. Sides were authentically good too. They were cheese grits and collard greens.
They look to have a really good happy hour too.
There's no doubt in my mind the next time will be 5 star! So happy to have Lucille's in Summerlin!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying this place. We we're really hungry so we sat at the bar. We order the fried green tomatoes the brisket nachos and the bayou shrimp which all loved except the tomatoes. Once we got our food we asked for water for about 15 minutes and it took the buster to do it he kept ignoring us and was drunk the brisket chx and Baby backs were really good also. I would try this place again but I won't sit at the bar next time... PS I am a waitress so I always tip no matter what but I just couldn't do it this time he had 2 tables and didn't take care of us the way he should've. In parking lot writing this review"}
{"text":"My sis-in-law raved raved raved about Lucille's so we finally decided to go to the Henderson location when we were @ Lake Las Vegas for a mini getaway for the weekend.  Now we know why she loves this place.  The sides just alone is what will make me go back.  Oh, how can I forget the apple butter and the yummy bread.  Okay, just for the apple butter and bread...I'll go back in a heartbeat.  My hubby devoured the piggy ribs however, I wasn't such a fan for the beef ribs.  I thought they were too tough and heavy...I think I'll try a fish dish next time (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5).  Next time, I'm gonna leave room to try a dessert and not eat so much bread in the beginning.  

Go go go if you crave BBQ!"}
{"text":"Excellent beef ribs. I was surprised that they were so good. The boyfriend wanted to try them, but I doubted they would be good, so we only ordered 3. They were delicious. Also ordered brisket and it was also really good. The peanut slaw is the pretty good add well add the vegetables, corn and garlic mashed. 

Regular BBQ sauce is tangy with a little kick. The boyfriend liked the spicy BBQ sauce. A lot of choices on the gluten free menu. I'm glad to have another GF restaurant with so many options. 

We ordered the food to go, so I had a Bloody Mary while I waited. It was really good. The perfect drink for a  New Years Day hangover."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was over the top. Our waiter was down to earth and very friendly. I could not even finish my food I was sooo full!"}
{"text":"Simple and good. We had a app of burned brisket ends and nachos. We loved them both and our server was cute, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow... I am impressed! I am very very picky about my ribs... I have yet to find any that are as good as mine....except today! The baby backs are excellent!!! I also had a side of mac and cheese and it was also very high on my pickiness list.... this is only the second restaurant to get my nod on that as well!! 

I love me a great Gumbo soup... this was either tied with the best or it is the best Gumbo that I have ever had....
Flippin' home run Lucille's... definitely on my list of new favorites!!! Thanks and we will see you again... soon!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed I was contacted by the owner about my dining experience. I was honest and told him it must have just been a bad day for the meat. Somewhat surprised he did not as much as offer me and appetizer if I came back.... But that's the game of business!"}
{"text":"When we lived in Las Vegas a few years ago, this was one of our fave spots. When in town, we usually go. The last 2 times were absolute crap. Over summer I asked for tritip by the pound, no sides, just to take home the next day for my husband. The girl acted clueless and it was so loud 8 could hardly hear her. After leaving I realized she charged me for 2 tritip meals and I got no sides, no discounted price for meat only or charging me by the pound. We went again as a family Tuesday night and they said a half hour wait. After 45 minutes we had to ask. We finally got seated and had one of the worst servers I have ever experienced at any restaurant. Took 15 minutes to get out drinks and take our order. It took another 45 minutes for food. He never checked in. They made an excuse that it was something with the baked potatoes... ok so could you come let us know and maybe we will have a clue or get a different side for the one person who ordered a baked potato?? At this point we just wanted to pay and leave but getting a check took forever and when he brought it over we just wanted our card ran so we could go. Tried to give him our card without even looking at the check and he wouldn't take it. Left the bill and ran off for another few minutes. After the whole thing, it took us 2 1/2 hours to eat bbq that is already premade. I doubt we will ever go back now."}
{"text":"Lucille's is a 1950's-eque BBQ joint located right next to the Green Valley Ranch Casino. If you go on a weekend night, I can guarantee that you're going to waiting for a table. A few of my coworkers and I went to Lucille's for lunch. And here's the review:

The Good: 
I had a BBQ salad and the meat, though there was not much on the plate, was flavorful and tender. I got to try some of my friend's brisket, and it too was juicy anf flavored nicely. I love that all of their drinks come in mason jars, and their menu offers a variety of BBQ items to choose from. In addition, they have an in-house smoker so the aroma of BBQ hits you right when you walk through the door.

The Bad:
The service is friendly enough, but sometime it felt like we were being rushed.  For lunch on a Wednesday, it was quite crowded, and we had to request refills on our drinks. In addition, their prices are a bit high for the amount of food you actually get. I've been to several BBQ places, and Lucille's seems to focus on being a bit more upscale than their competitors. 

Will I return? Probably. But, this is not my first choice in BBQ."}
{"text":"Worst Customer service!!!! was not happy at all will not come back."}
{"text":"Very good customer service the food was great way better than the one at Red Rock!!!!  Would come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ, super kid-friendly & the best service we've had in Las Vegas. It was a very busy night for the restaurant, so that alone, says a lot! Our server, Colton, was awesome, my kids loved him, as well."}
{"text":"Busy, good bbq. We like this neighborhood place. Biscuits are to kill for! We usually get 2 meat combo with baby back ribs and pulled pork. Fries are the best! We have been to several bbq places in town but this one is our favorite."}
{"text":"I left hungry after spending $65... My boyfriend and I ate here earlier today and all of the food was incredibly dry. He has eaten here before and said it was the best BBQ ever and we both were completely let down. We both love BBQ and I have never been so disappointed if I could I would give this restaurant negative stars. We ordered about 8 different items off the menu, the fried tomatoes and okra were okay, but lets be honest, they were fried and its pretty hard to mess fried food up. Then I ordered the pulled pork and the meat was extremely dry I also got 3 sides because I was so excited to try everything (braised greens, mac n cheese, and bbq beans). The bbq beans was the only thing that was okay. The service was really good, though I don't go out to restaurants for the staff. The bartender made really good drinks, but I felt like I had to drink more just to be able to stomach my food."}
{"text":"This is a poor excuse for BBQ. DON'T waste your time. I got sick here, I called the restaurant the next day to inform them. I wasnt trying to get a refund but just wanted to inform them. Little did they know that I'm a food service director for a very large hospital. I informed them that I got a food borne illness. (95% of food borne illness is from feces on hands in the finger nails.) The lady at the restaurant said someone from corporate was gonna call me right away!! No one called for several days then when they did had attitude like I made this up. Or my facts weren't correct? So at this point I told them I'd like a refund, well they don't give refunds but can send me a gift certificate? Why the F would I ever eat there again. Then they had their insurance company call me to confirm that it wasn't from their food? After going back and forth I finally was able to make them get a supervisor cause my facts were correct and they couldn't price then false. I hung up cause their not worth my time. I'm a chef a grill master chef to be specific, from Texas. This place is an embarrassment to the culinary world!!"}
{"text":"Good food and service, as usual. Docked a star for getting the awful table right outside the kitchen. By the time we realized how quickly and often the staff were moving around us, we were too hungry to ask to be moved."}
{"text":"One restaurant where we know we will always have a great meal. The ribs are so tender and delicious, the lemonade is refreshing and the apple butter and biscuits are oh so good. Hands down one of my favorite restaurants.

We had our rehearsal dinner here and it is a great place for large groups! Everyone enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"We have been to Lucille's a few times now. This time the food is good as usual, but the service sucked. I don't really want to point blankly out the waiter's name for the public so let me just say his name starts with \"X\", if their manager checks the review then he would know whom I am referring to. From the moment I sat down to order drinks, I could feel he wasn't to happy to be working tonight. No smile, no greeting, didn't even know what tea options they serve and was reluctant to check. The appetizers were served within a fair amount of time. But the BBQ food we had to wait for at least 45 minutes from the time we placed the order. For some reason, pretty much every other table around us got their food before we finally got ours - some table came after us. We have two little kids - by the time the BBQ got here they've all stuffed with appetizers and it's extremely hard for them to sit and just wait for us to eat. 

The food was too much that we ran out of room on the table to put them. We did not realize how big the family BBQ platter could be so we ordered that and also another platter to share; we also didn't realize some of the sides were the same from the two platters. We ended up finishing not even close to half of the food. The waiter, IF he paid any attention to customer needs, or if perhaps he did not calculate that by having us order $250 worth of food and drinks he could get a decent amount of tips from one table, he could and should give us a heads up of how much food we actually ordered. When the humongous BBQ plates arrived, NO waiter bothered to either empty out some of the plates/glasses from the table, nor help us move around plates. They dropped the plate wherever they could and was gone like wind. My poor father in law had to hold a hot heavy plate on his hands till we moved things around - including remove some plates/cups/menus on the floor. 
It took them forever to serve the food, however, they seemed want to rush us out toward the end. While most of us were still eating, the waiter came to ask twice if he could serve the hot towel!
Overall, I am definitely not happy with the level of service tonight - particularly this waiter. You get much better service in any fast food restaurant. Through out the 2 hours we stayed in the restaurant, he never smiled except once he squeezed out a fake smile. And all the time if he ever came to our table, he seemed so rush to get out there."}
{"text":"I agree with other reviews. On a Tuesday night there was still a 15 minute wait. Once we were sat the wait wasn't too bad to orderly food but the wait for the food was very long.   The order came out correct and the food was very good except for the Burnt Ends. They literally meant burnt ends.  They were way over cooked and it was like eating charcoal. The other three meals we ordered were great and the biscuits are fantastic.  I would recommend eating here but be a little patient.  The food is worth it."}
{"text":"Food was ok, ribs & chicken had good flavor. The shredded pork could use some improvement and the beans tasted like it has ketchup added. The muffins we're ok too. Service was good and atmosphere is family oriented."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here to meet a very nice couple. The service was very attentive by John our server. He kept our refills coming and plates cleaned.  He also suggested the Mardi Gras chicken which was a hit for me. The chicken was nice and fresh little spicy and an absolutely huge portion. My wife had the tri tip.  There smoked tri-tip was very good I prefer mine medium rare but this was smoke so it was well done yet it remained moist and tender. Overall the food was good the place is just a little pricey."}
{"text":"Pretty good neighborhood type BBQ. Waitress a bit in a rush. Ferried catfish and shrimp combo was a winner. And yes what everyone says about the fried pickle spears is true. Crunchy and delicious. Burnt ends never a poor choice. Great on tap beer selection and served ice cold. Casual dining was a nice change in LV."}
{"text":"Been here once before, it's a great place to get some BBQ!! Food was delicious, I had a beer & it was nice and cold especially being 103. My whole family enjoyed it. Our service was excellent. We went on Father's day so it was busy but we still enjoyed our lunch."}
{"text":"We were in the area and tried Lucille's on a whim.  We were not disappointed at all.  Very glad we decided to stop in."}
{"text":"Good BBQ is hard to find! I mean, you're looking for tender cuts of meat AND a hearty, flavorful sauce.  Lucille's has both!

The biscuits are super tasty and can be pretty dangerous...if you can limit yourself to just one, I applaud you!  We started off with fried pickles...I love that they are dill spears! They reminded me of the fried pickles I had in Miami last year.  They were delicious!

I got the beef brisket sandwich and it was fantastic! One of the perks is that they not only add sauce to the brisket, but they also have 3 bottles of sauce on the table for you to add to your liking: original BBQ, Memphis style BBQ, and HOT and SPICY (my favorite).  As a side, I stuck to the french fries which I now regret, because they weren't that great.  I knew I should have tried the cheesy grits! 

My best friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich and she said it was very tender.  Her side of choice as the Mac n'cheese...I sampled and me likey! Super cheesy and creamy!

There were only a couple of things I wasn't thrilled with:
1.  Our food took FOREVER to arrive after our appetizers.  However, the service was excellent and friendly!
2.  The sweet tea (which on the upside is served in a mason jar...I absolutely LOVE this), was beyond sweet! Next time, I'll order 1/2 sweet tea, 1/2 regular tea.  

That's pretty much it.  We did bring home half of our food which tells you that the servings are large and worth the price!"}
{"text":"Just left and immediately wanted to write about how great of experience it was! Thanks to Chris(topher) our waiter, who was attentive, approachable and had a great sense of humor. He made good suggestions and made sure our needs were taken care of. The food itself was great as well. Had the Texas-styled Brisket and it was almost as good as the ones I've had in Texas. Definitely made me wish we had a Lucille's back home!"}
{"text":"In my opinion , closer to 2 stars for service/policies, closer to 4 stars for the food.

So they have really good appetizer menu and prices during happy hour from 3-7 daily. The bad news, its only available in the bar part and they wont honor it in the restaurant part. So if its crowded and there are no seats in the bar, you get the pleasure of paying basically double because you have to sit in the restaurant. Terrible policy

I really do like their brisket nachos, sliders, onion strings, burgers, burnt ends and hot and spicy sauce.

Its in Red Rock so its priced casino style, a little higher than it should be."}
{"text":"This would pass as authentic BBQ if you've never had BBQ in TN, NC or TX.. The meat was flavorless. The prices were insanely high, even for Vegas. 30$us for a 2 meat combo! Atmosphere was loud and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and very good prices.  Portions are huge so order wisely.  Service is always fantastic and it's very kid-friendly."}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich was awesome. Smokey, meaty and tender. I love the mason jar glasses. All around a great spot for dinner if you're in Henderson."}
{"text":"The white picket fences and fake pigs adorning the place doesn't make me feel like in Memphis at a backyard barbecue, but the styling is definitely a bit different than other bbq places.

Some food items are good and others are not. Fortunately you're able to mix and match menu items with the availability of combo plates. Unfortunately, the chance of all those items being good is slim.

Sauces are good, atmosphere tries to be very southern and the menu offers lots of options.

A lot of the food served has more fat than meat though. Portions that should have been cut away are smothered in bbq sauce with the hope you won't notice. 

There are better barbecue places in the East Valley, much less the South, which is what this place tries to pattern itself after."}
{"text":"It's okay for franchise bbq. I like that the menu has many different selections to choose from. The fried pickles are delicious. I like that they had the spears over the chips. The fried shrimp appetizer was good and had decent size shrimp. My friend had the lunch combo with a beef rib and chicken. He was very disappointed that the rib was the size of Tyrannosaurus Rex but had the amount of meat as a squirrel leg. He was expecting a meaty rib considering the price of the lunch entree. We sat in the bar area. Our service was below average. We waited to be acknowledged. We waited for our order to be taken. We waited for our drinks to be delivered. We never got checked on after our meal was served. Our drinks were not replenished. And waited even longer for our check to come. A $50.00+ lunch for two was not enjoyable."}
{"text":"Lunch was great with retired magician Lance Burton. I had the tritip salad which was a full lunch and a side of cornbread. The strawberry lemonade is a thirst quencher. The server was attentive without being too intrusive. She was the perfect waitress. I had no complaints but surprised it wasn't more crowded. I guess it's a dinner place. Maybe the lunches are a little pricy but it's quality and plenty to eat."}
{"text":"Poor planing on someone part.  Just came for dinner and they quoted us a 35 minutes wait.  Half the the tables in restaurant are empty."}
{"text":"Extremely annoyed with this restaurant. We did not call for reservations and we were told that it would be a 30 minute wait however it has been substantially longer and the kicker is that more than half of the tables are empty."}
{"text":"Awesome barbecue joint.  It's kinda pricey so go with an appetite.  I've been about 4 times and ate at the bar.  No complaints"}
{"text":"Wow all the reviews for Lucille's are bad and yet I had a good time there last Friday night. Myself, Mark T, my friend Beth and her parents. Luckily Beth had a reservation as that place was packed. We had to wait a few minutes for our table to be ready but it was a good time for all of us to also catch up as I hadn't seen Beth's parents in over a year. 

We get to our table and order some drinks which by the way are served in mason jars. Pretty cool except for the fact that the ice tea was a little weak. We ordered some fried okra which was fried to perfection and piping hot. It came with two different dipping sauces but alas I just at them like popcorn. Note to self, wait for them to cool down before poping them in your mouth because those suckers were HOT! 

I ordered a full slab of ribs with greens and mashed sweet potatoes. OMG they were so good. The meat was falling off the bone and the sauce they used was a little sweet, just like I like it. I actually added a little more of their hot and spicy bbq sauce because I like both the sweet and spicy mixture of sauces on my bbq. The greens were ok but needed some hot sauce and the mashed sweet potatoes were good. I ended up taking most of my meal home because I got full off of the fried okra and as well as warm biscuits. My friend's mom ordered the exact same thing as I did, Mark T. ordered the chicken, in which he said was pretty good. My friend's dad ordered the tri tip in which he seemed to enjoy and my friend ordered the fried catfish in which she also seemed to enjoy. 

For dessert, the snickers ice cream pie was ordered along with old fashioned banana pudding. I had a few bites of the snickers pie and it was really good. I wanted to eat more, but I was already stuffed and I didn't want to overdo it any more than I already had. I didn't try the banana pudding but my friends' father seemed to enjoy. 

All in all, it was a good time. I mean the company I was with FABULOUS and the food was good. What more can you ask for on a Friday night?"}
{"text":"Wanted to go out for a good meal with my wife to celebrate our 12th anniversary so we chose Lucille's. This is our second visit but first without the kids. The reason I'm writing this review is due to the exemplary service we received from our server Alexis. I'd go to Lucille's every day of the week if I knew she'd be my server, she's THAT good! We had a few hiccups with our meals and she handled everything with a great smile and enthusiasm to make our dining experience a great one. As for the food, I had the blackened catfish which was good. My wife had the fried catfish and shrimp. The hiccups were the greens that came with my meal had pork in them (we don't eat pork) and my wife's fish needed to be cooked longer. We also had the roasted artichoke which we weren't too fond of. The fried shrimp and grits were the stars today. My wife's meal was completely replaced even though we'd eaten most of the shrimp and grits, my greens were replaced with mac n cheese and the artichoke was taken off our bill. This is what I call service! This is what I don't mind paying higher prices for! With everything that happened we still received that good ole southern hospitality from start to finish! We are two VERY satisfied customers!"}
{"text":"Excellent as always. Fantastic burger, hot crispy fries and some suds to wash it down. Service was great and the food was quick. Those buns are dangerous! Too good."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have tried to eat here.  We were told there was a long wait even though there were numerous open tables.  When i inquired about the open tables the section i was inquiring about was closed.  That was interesting to say the least as there were two tables in that same section were people were seated eating. Again this the same thing we were told the last time we tried to eat there and there were open/empty tables.  We left and took our business to another resturant. Needless to say we wont try again to eat there."}
{"text":"Wonderful tasty little treat!  They have fried okra !!!!  And the BBQ brisket was delish!  Large portions and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best BBQ spots in Vegas.  I'm from Dallas and I definitely know what I'm looking for with BBQ.  I wish I could've given 5 stars, but the service was definitely not up to par.  

BBQ Baby Ribs and St. Louis Ribs with baked Mac and Cheese is a MUST get!  And the watermelon iced tea for your refreshment!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to have to do this, as the manager was so nice as to contact me, but I have to stick with my 3. I went with a large group again. The waiter was very nice, however, he was not well trained. He seemed very flustered and confused. He would come up and get half the drink orders and then walk away, and come back later to get the rest. He walked around the table and sporadically asked for people's dinner orders, which left 2 of my friends without putting in an order. We had almost all the appetizers and most of them are good. I tried the ribs and they were okay. The sauce is too sweet for my taste. My order didn't come out with everyone else's. The waiter said that it was still being prepared... it was a salad. All in all, it's a good atmosphere, the service needs work and the food flavors are very sweet, which is good for some pallets, just not my own."}
{"text":"Currently guzzling Perrier. Ate too much because god damn it was great. Ribs were my favorite. Now fat is bulging out of my own ribs. Going to roll to bed now."}
{"text":"I've got to say, I was not overly impressed. The drinks were eh, and the food was decent. My cousin got the ribs and they were NOT GOOD at all.No flavor and way overcooked. I noticed 2 separate diners taking their ribs to go. (it's not going to taste better in your house, lol). I dont understand how a place that specialize in ribs makes ones that are inedible. My cousin had to return the baby back ribs. He took one bite and was unhappy. He took another bite and just couldnt do it. I said, are you going to finish and I swear, I thought he was going to cry!!! AHAHAHHAHA. So, he switched them out for the st. louis style. Those were not any better. He really did enjoy his chicken wings. That's the only thing he liked there. He is a HUGE meat eater. He LOVES BBQ! How did this place not deliver? The sides I tried were ok. The prices on the sides were fantastic. Every side is between $1.50 and $2.00. The mashed potatoes and mac and cheese were pretty good. The fried pickles were real good too. I like that you can get 1/2 portions on most appetizers. The service was absolutely awful. I mean, awful.  The bartender was \"working our table, and she was horrible. I had to get MY OWN SILVERWARE!!!!We did get another waitress for the last 15 minutes of our meal. That was redeeming, but I was not impressed. I did however enjoy the bread pudding quite a bit. This is a place I will not go back to. Between LOUSY service and lackluster food, I'd rather spend my time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took my honey and my service dog to lunch and we were pretty hungry. We started off with fried pickles and the BBQ sausage trio. All of which delectable.  The BBQ sausage trio comes with a dollop of slaw. You MUST have a bit of the slaw with each sausage piece - amazing!

For the meal, she had the St. Louis ribs with brisket. It was so fresh and it was like \"butta.\"  I opted for the salmon with sweet potato fries and watermelon slices. Beverages are served up in glass Mason jars. I had the lemonade - with a splash of strawberry mixed in and it was so refreshing. My girl had a Moscow Mule\" and a \"Rhythm as Blues\" and she loved both. 

Everything was so delicious, the service was impeccable and Blues music was just icing on the cake. Special shout out to our server Tesha. She is the consummate professional and with 15 years of experience, it shows."}
{"text":"Vegas (and Henderson) isn't known for it's BBQ, so Lucille's qualifies as one of the better spots in town. Sure, it's a chain, but it's one that serves up some pretty decent food.

The complimentary biscuits were ok, but I would have preferred cornbread. We shared a whole rack of baby back ribs ($26.99) with sides of coleslaw and BBQ beans. The ribs were tender and smokey with a bit of char  that gave it an added crispy texture. The beans were a bit spicy and the coleslaw was underdressed and bland.

We also got a side salad ($2.49) and a baked potato ($2.99) -- both typical and mediocre fare.

Our kid had the chicken fingers ($5.75) -- hand-breaded strips with ranch dressing on the side. He seemed happy enough with them and the fries, which I stole several of, were deliciously crispy and light.

Add a Fat Tire ($5.25) and a margarita ($6) to the dinner and it wasn't exactly a cheap meal. With the tip, dinner for the three of us came out to over $64. It satisfied a craving for BBQ, but I still prefer Buzz BBQ and Famous Dave's.

The atmosphere is what you would expect from a BBQ chain -- tchotchkes and flair everywhere with a southern feel. It's a fairly large restaurant in The District area of Green Valley Ranch with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, but expect a wait on weekend nights."}
{"text":"This was some excellent food.  We were a large group (14) without reservations and hitting it right at 6pm on a Thursday.  We were seated after maybe a ten minute wait.

They had a good beer selection of some local brews as well as some of my favorites (Abita for example). And the beers are BIG!

I thought the food was delicious.  I had the fried chicken sandwich (add avocado) and mashed potatoes.  The chicken was buttermilk fried chicken and the mashed potatoes were garlicky and tasty.  My husband had the short ribs and they were  melt in your mouth fall off the bone fantastic.  He had the peanut slaw and vegetable medley for sides and both were also very good.

The prices were more than I would normally pay for BBQ but I chalk that up to it being Vegas.  Everything in Vegas is a gamble.  One place is cheap and delish, the next is expensive and meh, but this one was darn good.

Our server was attentive and quick without being pushy.  The faux Texan accent he affected was unnecessary as we weren't looking for \"authentic\" in Vegas.  I mean, nothing about that city is authentic."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat ribs for me the best in town.
We always order full rack of baby bbq ribs mush potato and corn with salad
Portions are big to people can share one dish"}
{"text":"So, it ain't great. It ain't terrible. There's a reason why chain restaurants are what they are. I've been here a few times, and it's just what it is. Consistent, decent food. Service is relatively consistent. However, never have had a horrible experience. Yet, the last time I went, it was really off. Two of us ordered drinks from the bar & I swear, no exaggeration, it took them about 20-30 minutes to get us a beer & a margarita. Then, it took them 58 minutes to bring us our food; I only know this cause the Manager shared that with us while discussing the issue. Then once the food arrived, they switched my order with someone else at the table. When I caught it, they were quick to take care of it. However, I ended up canceling my order all together because I was afraid my food wouldn't make it back out until everyone at my table was done. Just a big ol mess!
Upside, our Server was super cool even during the disaster. However, I never blamed her for what happened. I mentioned to the Manager that she was great the entire time and he should double check the kitchen, the expeditors and the food runners. The Manager was an upside too. He immediately ran over to us, offered to rectify the situation. And when I asked him to cancel my order, he brought over the incorrect item in a to go bag & suggested that because they're just going to throw it away, if I wanted , I could have it. I politely declined. He then offered to give us dessert on the house however everyone else was too full & over it by this time, that we respectfully declined. 
Again, it's a chain. They do what their formula tells them to do. The food ain't bad. Service has always been good. Just this one time was a mess. I won't go running back, but it's there.


FYI... After a couple of hours of posting this, the owner of Lucille's, Brad, reached out to me via a DM. I REALLY appreciate when an owner takes pride as he did. SO I am changing it from a 2 star to a 3 star review. Again, THANKS Brad!!"}
{"text":"My husband insisted we come here in our trip to Vegas. If your staying on the strip its just a nice little drive to Henderson but it was well worth it. We went for late lunch so we were able to take advantage of lunch specials. Bbq sauce was tasting and lemonade cocktail hit the spot. I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am the duke, how can I not write a review? 
I always love coming to Lucille's. The vibe is right, it's never overcrowded, and it's some damn good service. 

The pulled pork is by far one of my more favorable sandwiches for BBQ. The pork itself has a great smoked flavor and they just pile it high. I usually pair it with the garlic mash or fries. The mac n cheese is alright, but depending on the day, could be a little soggy. My wife usually gets the shrimp po'boy. Good portion of fried shrimp with good slightly spicy flavor. But those biscuits though, and the apple butter, mmmm. 
All the staff is super nice, friendly, and fast. I always appreciate the \"southern\" hospitality mentality. Saturdays we like to sit in the bar area. Usually there is a band playing some pretty good rock and blues. Anytime I have friends or family come visit, we always come here."}
{"text":"I give it three stars because the food was pretty good. Had a 2 for 1 for lunch and came here for the first time. Limited lunch selection due to the coupon but still plenty of options. Had a pulled pork sandwich and my wife had the chicken barbecue sandwich .  Both were good and they have good fries as well.  A little slow in service. Waited a while for my check. Otherwise would have been a four rating."}
{"text":"Well...its Lucilles is very much a chain restaurant but for arizona what isnt?,,the food is great but for the price it should be the best barbque in town,also the portions are very small,ordered a bbq sandwich and the bun was bigger than the filling :/..the bar is nice and drinks made right..its just to expensive for what it is u could get better bbq for half the price elswhere"}
{"text":"I REALLY (REALLY) love their mashed potatoes and grilled veggies.. When I come here I always get the same entree... Southern fried chicken, which comes with the delicious veggies and potatoes I was referring to earlier. I also love their sweet biscuits and strawberry lemonade (I always end up drinking 2-3).. and you end the meal by having the choice of picking up some tootsie pops on the way out!"}
{"text":"If I could choose negative stars I would. Had a 6pm reservation Sunday night. Showed up at 530 and wasn't even seated until 625. Took another 20 min before someone even came to get a drink order! It's not like the place was packed...
Now the food:
Sauces are garbage and taste like synthetic preservatives,  the meat was cooked decently but you could definetly tell they were baking under heat lamps for a while cause they were pretty dried out.. Strawberry lemonade was fore though. .. I think they literally only came to ask how we were doing once. Idk,  there are WAY better bbq spots with much better food and prices. It's a shame rich folk think this is good bbq. Hell, famous Daves is better for Christ's sake."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time yesterday and the waiter Mark was very helpful. He explained the menu to us and gave us very good suggestions. I am not the biggest fan of red meat but they have the best Tri tip! The strawberry lemonade is amazing and they have the best cole slaw I've ever eaten! I definitely recommend eating here if you want really good BBQ and great service!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were amazing ! The first time Juan was my server and he was very fast and attentive! He came to do refills, bring us napkins, etc all those little things on time without us having to ask! The second time we had Claudia and she was so sweet. She was fast and attentive as well and made us feel very comfortable! Both times I've been here they made sure I had a great experience and plus the food being extremely amazing can't be beat! They have the best bbq sauces and don't skip their baby back ribs! It's good for two people, very filling ! I'll definitely be back here soon :)))"}
{"text":"There is not much to say other then...AWESOME. This place is bomb and you should just poke yourself in the eye if you think otherwise. Solid bbq and southern cooking. All negative reviews must of had a booger in their eye. GO...NOW....JUST STOP READING AND GO AND ENJOY.  

o HUGE SERVINGS...SHARABLE....I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M YELLING!!"}
{"text":"Been a while as last visit here not so great. First some changes are corporate so we were told.  Bbq chicken sandwhich...used to be able to share, used to be two reg.size breasts on a great roll.  Now it's 2 tiny  breasts on  hamburger bun that disingrates in your hands, more like a tapas size.  Total rip off.  They also changed their delicious ranch dressing to something more economical, need I say more?  It's disgusting.  Coffee was meh and not hot.  Chocolate cake was still great.
Sweet potato fries are good but without good ranch dressing to dip in, won't order them.  Regular fries were mediocre.  Hope corporate is happy saving a few bucks cause everyone we know is done w them, including us. Ironically lucilles was our favorite eatery even chose it for all major events, holidays, family gatherings. Treating friends. Biz lunches... not anymore!!! History.  I feel sorry for the mgr cause he seems to care, but his hands are tied.  Or so it seems."}
{"text":"Went back..service terrible again..
Not shift change but same terrible waiter as last time.  The foid was ok not great..chicken bit dry."}
{"text":"Four of us tourist stopped by on out way from the Ethel M. Chocolate Factory, about 4 miles away. If you get this near stop. We ordered takeout so we never saw the inside of the place.

Two of us shared .5 smoked chicken plus sides of collared greens, cheese grits & 2 biscuits. This meal was $17. DELICIOUS!  Best cheesy grits I ever had that was not cooked in either South or North Carolina. The greens were also mouth smacking good. We could not eat the biscuits; to much food and our plane departure time was 6AM the next morning.

If you want to take a break from the casino strip visit the Ethel M Chocolate Factory and their Cactus Garden then eat here. Save the chocolate candy you buy for later so you can eat all the food you order here."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner and was relatively impressed.  We ate at the bar and had good 'cue beforehand too.  The wait and bar staff was attentive and checked many times.  We also watched a game on the TV while enjoying BBQ and drinks.  What a great combo!  I liked the ribs.  They were cooked pretty well and fell off the bone.  The sides were good.  Keep in mind if you're counting carbs this ain't the place to do it!  The food is rich and good.  Nice spot for Green Valley Ranch!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it is kind of a mixed bag. I go for the brisket, which is great. I think  that 7 oz of brisket for $18 or so is a little much, but what can you do? Go at lunch.  

The good: iced tea, fantastic potato salad, and the brisket. The cocktails are good. I wish I could remember the name of the one I had. 

The bad: the weird greasy spread they give you with the biscuits. It is always waxy and not very flavorful.  It seems like they use cheap margarine. The hot links - too much garlic in my opinion, but I haven't had them in ages. Service can be iffy."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I like Lucilles... But some things are ridiculous.... 5 bucks for extra sauce with their takeout is 2 ketchup containers of sauce....

Update (12/16/17): So a couple days after the last review, I get contacted by a manager saying someone would be in touch in a few days by phone or email. Been a month now and nothing. still unsure if they've updated their online menu to fix the issue.

Update (01/07/17): And lo behold, their website still shows the extra barbecue sauces at $5. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"Best service I have ever had. Thomas and his coworker were working the patio and they were spot on perfect. They took care of us and the food was great. BBQ sauce so good we bought a bottle for only $5!"}
{"text":"For a good time, call Lucille!

I get really excited about visiting my mom's place in Henderson because it means that I get to go to Lucille's for some hard-core comfort food.  Lucille's is always dependable for fun southern drinks and a satisfying meat fest with all kinds of fixin's.  

Rolls and apple butter are complimentary.  Start with some fried dill pickles.  Then move on to any kind of BBQ meat imaginable with mac and cheese, collard greens, okra, cole slaw, or baked beans, to name a few.  I particularly like their house original BBQ sauce, although there are a few to choose from. 

I've always had decent service and the atmosphere is fun. Live blues plays on weekend evenings in the bar."}
{"text":"Good food, but not worth the price. I went here with coworkers for lunch, and although the decor is adorable and the food I ordered was tasty, I won't return here. The prices on lunch are on the high side for BBQ. I ordered an appetizer and it was not really enough to share with 2 or 3 people. Another thing I found to be ridiculous is that they have a place on the bill to round it up before the tip. Talk about money hungry. I would rather go someplace else for my BBQ."}
{"text":"There is no great barbecue in Vegas, but Lucille's  is pretty damn good! The menu is extensive, we've been going there for years and the food is off the charts. Whatever you're in the mood for, ribs chicken pork sausage or good old Southern fried dishes, Lucille's has you covered. The atmosphere of the place is also awesome, with Staff really friendly and making sure everything is right. Always a great experience in the 12 years we've been going there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for BBQ.

Lucille's offers some of the best BBQ in Las Vegas, but what sets it apart from me is that in addition to great BBQ, they offer variety and options that other BBQ restaurants don't.

The BBQ itself, I'd probably rate as a 4*, as its on the pricier side. However, they have a full menu and full bar, which a lot of BBQ restaurants don't have.

They serve hot buttermilk biscuits as starters and it comes with super tasty apple butter.

The butter has a sweetness to it, and pairs very well with the biscuits.

Their lunch specials are really good, and offer \"smaller\" portions of their dinner options with meat options coupled with their sides.

I've come here numerous times, so I'll list the items that I have tried and really enjoy.

Non-Alcoholic Beverages:
- Sweet Tea
- Unsweetened Watermelon Tea (my personal favorite)
- Strawberry Lemonade

Alcoholic Beverages:
- Back-porch Strawberry Lemonade
- Crocodile Cooler

Appetizers:
- Fried Pickles
- Rib Tips
- Brisket Burnt Ends

Entrees:
- Southern Fried Chicken
- Mardi Gras Chicken

BBQ Meat Favorites:
- Brisket
- Smoked Chicken
- Tri Tip

Sides:
- Mashed Potatoes
- Vineagar Cole Slaw
- Mac n' Cheese

Dessert:

- Snickers Ice Cream Pie
- Banana Pudding (with real bananas & vanilla wafers)"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were enjoyable, lil warm in there, service was decent could've been better!!"}
{"text":"As far as chain Bar-B-Que goes I have always preferred Lucille's over Famous Dave's so I am happy one finally opened in my neighborhood.  Their honey butter is addicting!  Our waiter, Christopher, was friendly and knowledgeable as far as the drink and regular menu was concerned.  He didn't steer me wrong with the Minty Julep with Gentleman Jack and the Crocodile.  I ordered the half rack with two sides.  I feel the price is a little high but that's to be expected with a chain Bar-B-Que establishment.  The whole table loved the shredded onion appetizer.  We went on a Friday night around 7, party of three, and had no problem being seated.  I would like to go back and try their Happy Hour in the bar so maybe next visit."}
{"text":"I've hit this place up a couple times because my friend had coupons from Red Rock, otherwise I'd probably never come here. Their sides as well as their bread with cinnamon butter are delicious, but I'm not in love with the BBQ burger. It was rather dry and the flavor was just ok. Their bacon is not crispy and was overwhelming in taste because it was cut super thick. I also had a tri tip sandwich here. The tri tip was decent with good moisture.

Obviously BBQ is going to be heavy, so no big deal there. I feel like Lucille's is rather pricey though, so I'd rather hit up places like Rollin' Smoke or Jessie Rae's as it's more the meat than the place that you're paying for.

Edit: The owner/manager of the Lucille's did contact me and informed me that they'd like me back for another try. I do appreciate this kind of customer service, and while I probably still won't return, I do think it's worth mentioning that they were kind enough to reach out to me."}
{"text":"One thing we must always consider when reviewing a restaurant is the delicate balance between the quality of the food, the level of service and the size of the bill. Lucille's has some marginally okay food offerings (although a true BBQ connoisseur would hold issue with this place) and it has a friendly and attentive enough staff. 

But the true measure of Lucille's becomes clear when you get the bill. Perhaps the high cost of rent in this hoddie-toddie little shopping district of Henderson is to blame, but when you sum up your dining experience (as you take out a small loan to pay for dinner) you realize that the food was certainly not worth the price. 

Why, oh why, can we not have a good BBQ place in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Firstly, I will say I am not a BBQ fan so this review is more for those of you who, like me, are going because those in your company want to go. 

Biscuits: nothing special. Very dry; wouldn't have been edible for me without the butter. 

Entree: I had the chicken sandwich. Good, but nothing spectacular. The sides were much better ( I ordered the Mac and cheese and sampled the cheese grits and potatoes from other people).

Service was okay, two people checked in on us but we still somehow sat around and waited for a bill and change.

Overall, not a good, but not a bad experience. I wouldn't recommend it based on my experience, but I didn't eat what they are famous for either.

EDIT: I was contacted by the business owner here on Yelp and he was apologetic about my experience and genuinely seemed to care about what I had to say. For this, I will give four stars because he could have just as easily ignored it."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the brisket, but at the end of the meal, I really felt like I was getting raped in terms of price. Maybe I'm used to cheaper bbq, but the gouging was a bit ridiculous.

The atmosphere is cute and I am more than sure that we are paying for where they are located...

That said, I loved the rolls w the apple butter. I have never been a fan of apple butter, but this place has made me think twice now.

Service was good, but man, was it crowded...That'll teach me to come here on a Saturday (even though this review is written almost a week later!)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a early happy hour. Here are good drink specials and food specials. While enjoying a few Blue Moons I sampled some rib tips,cheese fries and quesadillas. Tasty food at a good price. Time to go back for dinner, for the real test"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Lucille's this evening and it was phenomenal! Travis made our experience one of a kind! He was so kind, helpful, and knowledgable about the menu. We had the BBQ rib tips, the southern fried chicken, the pulled pork sandwich, and the chocolate cake! So delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was good but it's quite pricey for ribs. They make up for it by giving you a lot for your money. I should have shared a plate instead of buying two of them."}
{"text":"The worst dry, overcooked ribs that I've ever had in a restaurant. Had St. Louis & Baby's and both had been sitting out and not cared for, for an extended period. I've been smoking ribs for 25 years and know good and bad ribs, and this doesn't even make it to the bad category. 
Hell, Applebee's serves better ribs than what I received!"}
{"text":"Over-priced, terrible BBQ!!! $12 for chopped brisket sandwich and water....you kidding me??!!   Best part of the meal were the biscuits!"}
{"text":"I have since received (2) $25 gift cards to Lucille's which I gave to my son, my husband & I don't care to go back (yes, it WAS that bad). I appreciated the follow-up & the gift cards but there was no excuse for that horrible meat, so I give them 3 stars for that."}
{"text":"This is one of my goto places. always solid and they have beef ribs. I also recomnd the brisket."}
{"text":"Good Service Strikes Back!

Let me start by addressing that I was contacted per my previous review and promptly had my issues address. Onward to my recent take out experience this evening:

For Me: 1/2 slab baby back ribs
Sides: BBQ Beans and Mixed Vegetables

For Partner: BBQ Shrimp Dish 
Sides: Cheesy Grits and Greens

Man what a comeback. I thoroughly enjoyed the ribs, did not finish them all since I already ate one the complimentary warm biscuits. I did find them to be tender, juicy, and well sauced. They still had the char on the outside and just mmm. Well worth the calories. A nice compliment were the beans, they come in a flavorful juice/stew. So they definitely need to be eaten with a spoon to scoop up. The flavor was on point, both sweet and spicy. I would order these again! The mixed vegetables were not really anything to write home about. I think they should be more accurately labeled as carrots and zucchini instead of mixed vegetables which makes me think at least a variety of three. There is not much in the way of seasoning on them but they definitely taste fresh, you can tell immediately by the smell. Not bad but not something I would order as a side again, probably do corn over this. 

I had a taste of everything on my girlfriend's plate. I have lived the majority of my life in New Orleans and have a low bar of expectations when it comes to southern food made in Arizona. The bbq shrimp had notes of Louisiana bbq shrimp in the spices and seasoning but the composition being a red sauce, rather than the normal butter sauce, did not serve it well. The shrimp were juicy and plump. Cheesy grits had a nice consistency and were not overpowering in cheese flavor, something that tends to happen in other locations more often than you think. I found them to be pleasant pairing to the shrimp. The greens had a nice kick to them and were descent in their cook. These two sides come standard with the BBQ shrimp and I am not sure why the greens were added, since you have thin juice to pair with the thick sauce of the shrimp. I would recommend a different side for the dish but by themselves they are worth getting. 

Something to note: 
While waiting for the food I had a pleasant conversation with the manager and staff. All of whom, carried an excellent attitude and added to a friendly atmosphere. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"We had a large group birthday dinner here couple months ago. I am not big fan of BBQ food so I ordered a tri tip salad and grilled artichoke. Tri tip salad came in very big portion with special BBQ sauce. My artichoke was done perfectly. And I loved their free biscuits with spiced honey butter!! It was so good, I didn't finish my salad because I had 3 biscuits that night. Our waiter was very friendly and efficient. He even separated everyone's bill for us in the end (we had 23 people in the party). It's a great place for large group dinning."}
{"text":"We went to Lucille's on Saturday night and had no problem getting a table on the patio. The menu is overwhelming because it's gigantic & everything looks absolutely delicious on it, so it's hard to choose. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw which was fabulous. Big, but not too big to have leftovers. My husband ordered a rack of ribs with mac & cheese and sweet potato fries. Everything was awesome & somehow still we had no leftovers. 

The complimentary biscuits are worth trying Lucille's out in itself. 

A must try!"}
{"text":"I have visited this Lucile's many times in the past and I can affirm that it is consistently awesome.  The seating is comfortable, the service is excellent and the food is some of the best in town.  

Prices are up a bit in 2015 but they haven't cut back the portion sizes or cut the side items and the quality is still excellent.  You can't find many places in Las Vegas where the BBQ is this good.

I love the large glass jar drinks, you can get dry in the desert but the drinks here are large enough to keep you well hydrated.  

My menu favorites are the baby back ribs with the tri-tip, garlic mashed potatoes and grilled corn on the cob.  You have to get a side of butter for the corn, and it is delicious.  
 
If you are lucky enough to catch them when they have their pumpkin cheesecake don't miss out on that, it's also tasty."}
{"text":"BBQ must be slow cooked, slow cooked with wood. baby back ribs, pulled pork, brisket."}
{"text":"The service stated ok. We order the special for 2. After 40 mins of waiting for our food, the food server comes just to spill the food on me. He apologized picked up some of the food and walked alway. At that point I should of gotten up to leave. We sat at our dirty table trying to get our waiters attention but he just ignored us. One of the other waiters passed gave us an \"omg\" look and we asked to change tables. Our waiter came up to us only after the replacement food came out and asked us what happened. I told him what had I had our food spilled on us and he just said \"I was wondering why they brought out the food again. We were so hungry we stayed to eat. When bill came the check said it was for four Guest they billed us for two orders of the special and discounted one as \"service\". When we asked him he told us that the way they billed that special. No apology from the waiter. I was pissed and didn't want to make a scene so I paid and walked out. I won't be going back that's for sure."}
{"text":"The sampler appetizer was greasy and notso special... The tri-tip was really REALLY good, and the drinks were poured well... They have a few options for BBQ sauce, and if I was a big fan of BBQ, I would probably rate this place a 5... But I'm not and because of that I can take it or leave it. My friends who really dig BBQ though think Lucilles is the Bee's Knees."}
{"text":"Being someone raised on southern food, I'm pretty picky about my barbecue....Now THIS is BBQ, my Friends."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give them a 3 star rating on this last visit. It started out good and then it went downhill. I sat at the bar and it was happy hour, so great prices on appetizers and drinks. I ordered a cocktail and my favorite, fried pickles. So far all is great! After finishing my pickles it seemed like a while before my sandwich came but the sandwich would be worth the wait. I get the brisket and portobello sandwich usually so yummy. The sandwich finally comes, I pick it up and oh no, the bottom bread is all soggy. It must have been sitting for a while. I eat around the soggy part, the rest is still good and the Mac and cheese was delicious. I finish what I can and decide I will get my dessert to go. We'll, when I arrived there were 2 bartenders and the guy that took my order was on it, he took my order, made my drink and he was very nice. Shortly after my pickles came he disappeared and the girl that was taking care of the other side of the bar didn't seem to have any customer service skills at all. When she cleared my plate and drink glass she did ask if I wanted more water. She filled it and then pushed my tab in front of me. I waited a few minutes and then figured I might as well order my cheesecake from the take out window, so I got out my card to pay. I told her I had wanted to order cheesecake but then I changed my mind. I know she was working the whole bar by herself but really! A few days later I got my cheesecake from the one in Henderson, they were very nice. I will probably give them another chance but might not sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Food is great. Deep fried pickles are awesome, brisket and portobello mushroom sandwich is another good choice. Make sure to save room for their bread pudding. Service was terrible in bar, I normally eat in dining area but it was Sunday so I wanted to watch football, never again seemed like it was a bother for the bartender to have to wait on me. I had to ask for silverware and condiments, only as I was putting on my coat was I offered a refill on my tea. The food is great but eat in the dining room."}
{"text":"Everyone knows that BBQ is about the sauce........they have amazing sauces!   Great menu options, great food, awesome service!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the happy hour here at Lucille's.  The fish tacos were dang good and the drinks were perfect.  
Fri and Sat nights are a great time to hang out at the bar, eat and listen to the live blues band.  Nice local neighborhood place to relax on the weekend."}
{"text":"Ribs were certainly delicious. I cannot get enough! Meat falls right off the bone!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I love fried green tomatoes and they were the best I have had. My husband said the burnt brisket was to die for!!"}
{"text":"We got the family feast $124.00!  Plus I had to order another $8 side and extra biscuits.   It served 5 adults and 2 kids.  I think for the amount of food we had it was very pricey.  The ribs were good, didn't love the sauce.  the chicken was super dry.  The bisquits were like rocks, no one ate them.  Beans and cole slaw pretty good.  I would definitely not return due to the small overpriced portions."}
{"text":"I just ate here and Iam stuffed!

My group order the following:
Full order of BBQ Ribs pork 
Full order of BBQ ribs beef
Corn chowder 
Tri tip salad 
Jambalaya"}
{"text":"I have always had a love for their BBQ chicken. It is seriously the best around. It must be brined, smoked and treated with all kinds of love. The chicken is always tender and juicy and loaded with flavor. Brushed with just enough sauce and with a nice crisp grilled skin. 

I also love the gigantic mason jars they use for drinks, never need to ask for a refill which is always a plus.

How do they always pick such perfectly ripe watermelon?"}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing! You can go in, order to go, or pick up and either way the food will come out amazing. Love this place! Their gumbo is my absolute favorite!

Update
Aug 23
Had Xavier this time and he was so so kind! He is a great artist, (showed us some sketches). If you're looking for a good and friendly server to talk to he is the one you should ask for. 
Had the Louisiana pasta this time YUM"}
{"text":"We came in this afternoon and were seated within a couple of minutes.  The service here was not bad, although not great either.  The staff seemed like they were going through the motions.  I feel like their high prices did not match the level of customer service.  The biscuits they served were way too dry, even with the bitter apple butter that came with them.  
We ordered the tri tip, the catfish, and the beef brisket, along with a kids meal.  The kids meal was great, the rest of the meals were just way overpriced bbq.  The sauce they use isn't anything special.  Seriously not really impressed.  I wanted to love it, but can name at least 3 other bbq restaurants I would rather go to."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place, in any location.  This place is huge, lots of seating inside and out.  Ambiance, nostalgia décor, all very welcoming.  Pulled pork is delicious and so tender, same with the tri tip, the chicken is just right.  Large portions, we ordered a half order of onion straws and it was enough for 8 people, easy.  Very tasty, light and crispy.  The BBQ shrimp was a little spicy but good.  The drinks are great and also on the large side.  There BBQ sauce is really good, 3 different types of hot.  Always a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"Friend's fam was in town and we surely went-to-town and went ALL IN, baby!

Got the appetizer sampler which consisted of fried pickles, fried onion strings, fried green tomatoes, fried chicken strips...basically FRIED HEAVEN!!!!!
I was excited to try the fried green tomatoes as I had no clue what that would taste like. And it was...fried-green-tomatoes. Stupidly, simple as that. lol

Got the sampler platter for the main course. It had tri-tip, baby back ribs, bbq chicken, a watermelon and mac and cheese as our sides. Lemme tell you that after our appetizer platter, I was pretty much dunzo. But, had to shovel some ribs, and mac in cheese in me.

Love their sauces on the table. Full bottles of regular bbq, spicy bbq, and sweet bbq. I like to mix the regular with the spicy!

Again, our server was a sweetheart! Always with the refills of sweet tea and other delish alcoholic beverages we had on hand =)"}
{"text":"Wasn't the best bbq I've ever had but was mediocre at best. Came with a huge group (30 total) and the restaurant was very accommodating and had great service for that big of a group. I give it an A+ in that department. Ambiance of the restaurant was cool, a little different but fun to look at the decorations.

On the other hand the food was just alright. I ordered the bbq sliders one of each: pork, beef, and chicken with a side of bbq beans. The beans tasted different than normal beans that I have had before, they had more of a smokey flavor. The sliders were alright. The chicken one was by far the best out of the 3 different sliders because it was the most moist one. Overall just a mediocre place. I didn't walk away from the restaurant saying \"that was the best BBQ I've ever had!\""}
{"text":"A strong 5 stars!!!

I had been wanting to try this place for a while and finally did the other night. All I can say is wooow!!! It was everything I expected and more. 

I got the bbq two meat combo I got the baby back ribs and the spicy hot links and as my sides i got the baked beans and the mac n cheese. The ribs were falling off the bone and the bbq sauce was delicious so sweet and flavorful, the hot links were nice and spicy. As far as the sides the mac n cheese was creamy cheesy goodness and the baked beans were sweet and had a lil kick also very good. Oh and it comes with a slice of watermelon which just happend to be the sweetest juiciest watermelon ive ever had. I also grabbed a few bites of my bf's mashed potatoes and omg they were sooo creamy and delicious. To wash this mouth water meal down I had sweet tea with my meal which was just as delicious as the meal. 

I was oooing and awwwing the entire meal I went there expecting a great meal and thats exactly what i got. They have good quality food, huge portions, and good service.

Its a lil pricey for bbq about $80 with tip but it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place their food and service was amazing. The waitress took care of us, there wasn't a moment that we waited too long. The food was A LOT but it was good, I wish the corn bread was a little better but other than that everything was delicious. I also loved the fact they gave us warm towels to clean our hands after eating BBQ"}
{"text":"Lucile's bbq. Happy hour here Monday thru Friday 3pm-6pm and 9pm to close 7 days a week. The rib tips and Irish nachos with pulled pork are the best. This might be the only place with fried pickles in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Not quite my taste for Texas Brisket considering I'm fromTexas. But great Memphis pulled pork. Sauce is bomb diggity no doubt. Love the location too in green Valley. Definitely a nice spot to get your fat on. Awesome place."}
{"text":"Great menu with tons of options. Great service, good food and comfortable seating! Very nice decor and good vibes. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Maybe I was expecting too much but I was told this was the BBQ place to go.  There is a sister restaurant in LA and I heard good things about that restaurant as well.  I had the rib tips to start and they were a little sour and just tasted like meat. I went for the triple platter special which had tri-tip, ribs and something else. They all were ok and I found the meat was a little tough. The mac and cheese was spot on though. 

The service was horrible!  Our back waiter was initially really good. He got our drink orders and even gave us some tips on what to order. Then we never saw him or our waiter throughout the rest of our meal.  We had to flag down other servers for drinks and our check.  The sad part about it was the restaurant wasn't terribly busy and our section was practically empty. Terrible service always makes me never want to go back to a restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought Lucille's was OK, but not really my style of BBQ. If you prefer the sweet and drippy style of BBQ with lots of sauce, this might not be your sort of place.

Also, the baked beans were good but had a lot more too them than just beans. I wasn't expecting that, and neither was my stomach."}
{"text":"I went for lunch. Had a tasty strong Margarita on the rocks. Nice hostess, free biscuits, & WOW! Carolina Stuffed Baked Potato & Salad----DELICIOUS!!  It's a little expensive & takes some time to make, but WORTH the wait/$."}
{"text":"Really cool atmosphere, very southern bbq style. However we got seated only to realize that you couldn't order happy hour drinks or appetizers in the restaurant, only in the bar area (weird). So we relocated and sat in the bar instead. Biscuits and apple butter was AMAZING. BBQ chicken salad was delicious and came with onion rings as well. Service was super fast for drinks and food and they ended the night with a hot hand towel (fancy!)."}
{"text":"I went here with the child I nanny for and he loved it! He was pleased with the sauce and I was pleased with the service. They attended to everything we needed! Even when we asked if we could have a plate full of mint leaves! The spinach artichoke dip was a bit boring and basic. The biscuits and butter was amazing! The butter is sweet and had some cinnamon in it. It was an overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I have had BBQ from all over the country. This place has some good southern BBQ right here in PHX.

The meat is always moist and smoked good. 

Make sure you try the brisket and the pulled pork! 

Oh and the ICE Tea mixed half with sweet and half with regular is awesome !"}
{"text":"I was here last week for a work dinner. We were doing a team build thing at Tempe Marketplace and this place was convenient. I like BBQ as much as the next guy, but had just started my non-land animal diet. I found few appetizing options for myself. There were some seafood things, but nothing that stood out as possibly being great. So I broke my vow and went full bore into a plate filled with a few different cuts of cow. I had some brisket, tri-tip and beef ribs. The tri-tip and brisket were very tasty and tender. Totally worth it. The beef ribs were good, not great. A little too much fat and not enough meat. Big portions and it came with mac and cheese, which was good, and some garlic mashed. The potatoes were sort of industrialized, but tasty. I left extremely full as did everyone else a the table. Everyone had something different and everyone was satisfied. 

Overall, not bad, but not great. In a bind at Tempe Marketplace this would be a respectable choice."}
{"text":"I have been to Lucille's many times at other location but just recently became aware of  this location. For people that like BBQ Lucille's is a great chain restaurant. However this Lucille's is very inconsistent compared to other locations. I have been here twice and my orders have been messed up both times and things like the biscuits were under cooked and the ribs were overcooked. However the staff was nice just disorganized took a incredibly long time to get a refill etc. Very nice restaurant with nice windows facing a fountain however the food quality control needs some major help. Extra star for cleanliness and location however this Lucille's is not consistent with the other locations."}
{"text":"I ate here tonight and found it to be very good. i ordered a combination platter with Beef ribs, Chicken, and Sausage. They were out of corn on the cob which was disappointing but the meats were really good, Before the meal we received biscuits and i ordered a salad which were both great and had some of the best apple butter and Ranch Dressing I have ever had.  when my main meal arrived one of the beef ribs was over cooked but they replaced it with a fresh one quickly. I washed it all down with some Watermelon Ice tea which was really refreshing. Overall a great meal worth 4 stars. But what really made it great was the staff. Our server was great which I forgot her name unfortunately but she was a small Latin girl with a giant smile and was great . And the manager Carissa running the ship helped me when I lost my Credit card which i really appreciated. I like when a restaurant has nice people that really try to help. It makes the whole experience that much better so I will give them one more star for a total of 5..........."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've been to this restaurant. The atmosphere is great. We had the burnt ends and fried pickles for appetizers. Both were really good, and I highly recommend. I ordered the hot link sandwich, and it was okay. The hot link is the best part of the sandwich. The coleslaw wasn't that good. It was too sweet for the sandwich. The bread okay. I drank the strawberry lemonade, which was so delicious."}
{"text":"hostile...belligerent...unfriendly...RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. I came in to pick up an order of beef ribs.  the hostess rolled her eyes at me.  the guy behind the delivery desk ignored me.  the person who was manning the take out counter finally came and was indifferent.  the potato salad was warm..ILLEGAL....the ribs were cold.  WHY WOULD I COME BACK?  done with lucilles!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! What more could you ask for? The Southern Fired Chicken Sandwich was amazing. A really large sandwich but not overwhelming, very crispy and tasty!"}
{"text":"You know what reallllllllly chaps my ass? When a table that gets seated after I've been seated and ordered gets their food before me. Even worse when TWO tables that were seated after me get their food before me. Even worse when we ask the manager about our food and she says the ticket times are running 20 minutes and our ticket was only put in 15 minutes ago when we had been seated for 45 minutes already. Even worse when my friend asks for another beer while we wait since our waiter had not come over once to check on us and the manager rolls her eyes at him.  Even worse when our food finally arrives 55 minutes after we've been seated and they have given me the wrong sandwich and there is skin on top of my husband's grits from sitting so long.

It was really hard for me to not flip the table over at that point. I kept the wrong sandwich because I'd already waited close to an hour and was starving.  I will say that my wrong sandwich ended up being very tasty and they took it off the bill, but the experience with customer service was quite disastrous and I won't be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"Eat here all the time. Love the two meat combo; I usually get the ribs (they have 3 types: baby back, St. Louis and beef - all 3 are good and the beef are huge), burnt ends (sometimes they are overly burned) or pulled pork. They have 4 different BBQ sauce bottles on each table so you can really pick and choose your exact taste.

Several of the sides are good including the baked potato (pretty good sized), corn on the cob, Mac and cheese (it's plain), and baked beans (served in a nice little very hot cup). 

Beer selection is ok, not too many craft selections but I don't think that's their audience and they have some house beers so maybe they're trying to get you to go with theirs. They have a beer flight and I'd recommend it, not just to try some of their house brews but the price is pretty good. They make a good mule (4 mule options to choose from), and their coolers are good also. 

I'm a dessert person and believe I've tried each that they have - they are all good. My personal favorite is the peach cobbler. It's pretty large, has a nice hard top crust with a great soft under, nice amount of peaches. Really yummy, and if you didn't save room they can pre-box it for you to take home with the check :)"}
{"text":"Lucille's has BBQ down right.  Their smoked meats are delicious and their sides are seriously on point.  They are not inexpensive, but like most things in life, you get what you pay for.  I have patronized many BBQ joints in town and at the end of the day Lucille's is my favorite."}
{"text":"Was in Tempe with my Wife and two children. We were in the mood for some BBQ. My Wife found a Lucille's in a large outdoor mall near ASU. Against my better judgment, I agreed to go. I wasn't thrilled because it was way too close to the university. My idea of a good meal doesn't include lazy college students serving my family food. When we arrived, we were greeted by a very friendly Host. We were \"turned over\" to a young man (Josh) to escort us to our table. Easy name to remember because my son's name is Joshua. During our route, Josh engaged us in very friendly conversation and even thanked us for \"coming in today\". Once we arrived at our table, Josh asked us if we would \"enjoy sitting here\". Once seated, Our server, who's name escapes me, arrived a short time later and took our very complicated order; my son and daughter are very picky eaters. So I felt sorry for our server because she was very patient and friendly. Our meal arrived much quicker than I anticipated. While enjoying some of the most delicious BBQ I've ever had, we noticed we were missing a side dish. Josh was walking past our table and he must have noticed something wasn't right. He asked us if everything was delicious? I told him we were missing a side dish. He apologized and hurriedly left. Our missing side dish was brought by a second server who was just as friendly as Josh and our server. This Lucille's has a winning combination of great food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Great dinner with Family. Food was great, service was wonderful. Did not wait long to be seated. Our table was comfortable and fit the whole party. Left happy & Full!"}
{"text":"This place is maybe one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. Maybe the best ribs in Vegas. Absolutely the best tri tip I've had anywhere in North America.  The Mac and cheese is great, the fries are great. The biscuits are very very good. The service is excellent. I could go on and on, but this place is my favorite BBQ place in Las Vegas. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. Also, if you're trying to save money, the entrees are big enough to share."}
{"text":"Christmas day. Just saw a movie and we were at Red Rocks. Everything was packed with 1 hour wait times. Lucille's had immediate seating.

I love good BBQ. I love a good cocktail. Ordered the Moscow Mule. They served it in a frufy glass and not a copper mug. Had agave syrup. Not a huge fan. Not a real Moscow Mule.

The server was not as attentive as a server should be.

I had the full rack of Baby Backs. The wrong order was brought to our table. They were good. The sides were good. Would have been nice to have a side of BBQ sauce.

We were there just over an hour. Their famous biscuits and apple butter which were promised prior to the meal never arrived. We were told they ran out and were in the oven. At the point we were paying our bill I got the same story from the server.

I spoke to the manager and he handed us a bag of biscuits to go within moments. If you are going to offer a signature biscuit, one had better manage the kitchen better.

I really do like Lucille's in general, but this review was based on this specific visit.

Updated: The management reached out to me and apologized and gave me a $25 card for a future visit. They must care."}
{"text":"Returned here last week with my husband and we both agree with many Yelp  reviewers that, while expensive, the barbecue is tasty, the atmosphere is inviting and the service is friendly.
We go back whenever we're up for sit-down, smokehouse flavor served up with Southern hospitality!"}
{"text":"Oh i am a sucker for some good beef ribs and burnt ends....  I'm here about two times a week and it can be not as good as other times but today was better than average for sure I got the beef ribs well done because I like things burnt and they did what I asked of them! I also tried the corn bread for the first time tonight and I can say I'm not disappointed.... Not the greatest I've ever had but good..... Had pieces of corn baked in and a large portion for the     $.99 I'm pretty happy with my choice tonight I will be back as always at one point I did have a problem with ordering to go but it seems like they fixed any issues I may have had in the past the workers are knowledgeable and that really makes the experience? better"}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu mon-fri 3-7pm and 9pm-close 7days a week! They also have a live band on the weekends at 7pm, but can get pretty busy dinner time so make a reservation:)"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a BBQ man, but I must say that this BBQ was delicious. I went with some coworkers and the sliders are delicious. The plate size can go to a extremely large plate for just one person. Though overall, the burgers were like a usual burgers; but those sliders were something different.  A kind of taste you can't really get at a typical restaurant. That meals can get a bit on the expensive side; though based on the quality of the food and the price. Some of the orders are a great deal; deals like 3 kinds of meat for only around 10 to 12 dollars. I must state that I loved the fact they gave us mason jars as drinks instead of a typical water cup, really goes with the southern BBQ aura of the place and gives you more to drink. Specially if you order one of their teas, that seem homemade and like real tea. 

All the waiters that we got were all respectful and did everything with speed. We got seated right away and our drinks were ordered and ready in no time. The food took a while since there were four different orders. But there was always a waiter coming back to check on us and filling our drinks back up. I never went with an empty drink. Our waiters weren't there 24/7, which was nice since they gave us time to talk and enjoy the southern environment. The warm towels at the end to wash our hands and face is definitely a great add, never seen that at any other restaurant. 

The whole aura of the place is a southern BBQ home, which is exactly what I saw. The tables and the chairs weren't anything fancy, but where comfortable and definitely looked like a family table.  The whole aura went along with the food and the drinks. It all fit together like a picture film."}
{"text":"Great food. Happened to be some live music the night I ate there.  The food is great and they have some of the best biscuits Ive ever had.  Im from the South if that tells you anything. Huge portions were a plus as well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I try to go out to lunch, just us, while the kids are in school, at least once a week.

(Insert the song  - T'Aint Nobody's Business If I Do by Otis Spann (1930 - 1970))

We walked through the Red Rock Casino and Resort to the casino entrance. We noticed a sign asking patrons to go to the other hostess station to be seated. While walking to the OTHER SIDE of the restaurant we were greeted by someone \"who would be happy to seat us.\" Only to have that person turn around and seat us at the nearest booth... how convienent.

(Insert the song  - Born Under A Bad Sign by Albert King (1923 -1992))

The atmosphere was fine, loved the decorations, love the music being played.
Part of the decor included fake trees in one section of the dining room. Which led me to wonder how much dust has collected on the leaves. How often are the leaves actually cleaned?

(Insert the song  - Dust My Broom by Elmore James (1918 - 1963))

The food was fine by me. I had some chicken and brisket which is a staple in my diet. But no sooner would I server come by and ask how things are doing, a manager or such would ask the same two minutes later. Felt kinda over done. 

(Insert the song  - Got To Be Some Changes Made by Otis Rush (b. 1934))

All in all everything was real good. But it was the little things that added up and made me want to leave one star off my review. Would I return to Lucille's? Let me answer that by saying...

(Insert the song - 
One more now, Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?
Look out, Lucille
Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright -

{"text":"I had the Tri Tip Salad and it was wonderful. My favorite by far is the Peach Lemonade. Yummy can't stop drinking them. The servers are all friendly and provided excellent service. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"We had rib tips, fried okra, chicken, brisket, smoked artichoke and it was all soooo good.  The sweet tea was excellent too. Good portion size, excellent service from Ashley, glad we beat the crowd."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit at this location.
Went about 10:30pm Saturday for late night bite.

Wife ordered Pulled Pork Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries & I ordered the Tri Tip Sandwich with Pasilla Peppers, Jack Cheese with Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw.
Nothing special about the Pulled Pork Sandwich or Sweet Potato Fries.

Decent amount of Pork in Sandwich & good flavor but easily forgettable.
Wouldn't crave it or make me want to come back to order same.
Fries were barely warm & not crispy. More like having sit for some time?
The Peanut Slaw was good but sure Stingy with amount served.

The Tri Tip Pasilla Pepper Sandwich had good flavor in general. 
Meat was tender, juicy & tasty.
The slivers of Pasilla Pepper with Jack Cheese added flavor to the meat.

However, again, stingy with the amount of meat & slivers of Pasilla Peppers. 

They, like many Sandwich places, pile most of the meat in the center so when cut in half, appears to have adequate amount of meat?
But the center pile was not very high & had to move some meat from center area to edges where no meat existed. 

At first I though sandwich was going to have a whole Pasilla Pepper stuffed with Jack Cheese, which would have been great but as it turned out was only slivers of the pepper in very limited, sparsely spaced amount.

You'd think that, for $14.49 you would get a little more meat & an adequate amount of the peppers and use somewhat larger slices of bread? 

The advertise thick grilled sourdough but I would prefer regular thinner larger slices!
They use the thick sliced bread to make the sandwich appear bigger but in reality,  it's just a Small Fat $14.49 sandwich!

I'll have to try ordering the same sandwich at the District location to determine if that is same or not?
My guess is that the District location will be better all around.

On the upside, the waiter service was great this time."}
{"text":"Miss Dani, the carni-whore, is estatic! A+ food and service!

There are somethings that I absolutely cannot live without: free food, happy hour, and RIBS! This place gave me a triple-wammy. Happy hour 3-7pm, Free desert with a purchase of entree (another birthday freebie), free biscuits and some of the best smokey babybacks. 

Biscuits - freshly baked, soft on the inside, toasty on the outside, dipped in honey gravy, so yummy and so very FREE
Babyback ribs - tender, juicy, throughly smokey and falling off the bones, no fat
Seafood Gumbo - thick and full of shrimp and squid, not too salty, flavor is just right
Memphis style bbq chicken wings - vineager makes it a bit zesty, so good and I don't even like chicken
Peach cobbler - baked to perfection, warm crispy crust, just the right sweetness

My waitress was pretty, had a beautiful/friendly smile, attended to my every request, refilled drinks regularly. What a difference! 

LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Fish was good...  Terrible place to visit if you are a pesco-vegetarian....  Ribs looked good enough to kill ya!"}
{"text":"I love Lucille's BBQ and this place delivers. We've always experienced great service and quality of food at this location and enjoy the relaxing \"backyard\" atmosphere of their outdoor patio.

My favorite is the beef ribs with macaroni and cheese and baked beans along with sweet tea. If you're up for an appetizer, get the grilled artichoke. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"The tri-tip never disappoints. The brisket was a little fatty. The biscuits seem to get smaller and smaller. Over all a solid experience and good food."}
{"text":"Not what I call BBQ. Very commercial. Being from Texas I prefer smoked meat that is not cooked with the sauce on it. I prefer to choose sauce or no sauce. 

Probably ok for the casal diner
If you are picky about real BBQ. Keep looking."}
{"text":"I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  I made a yelp account just to say that this place has the single worst service ever.  As someone who once worked in the food industry I have more patience and understanding than most but when shitty service (3 times in a row) leads to bad food that has been sitting under a heat lamp for 20 minutes, when the server drops my food in front of me and doesn't apologize but runs away and doesn't offer to comp anything, and when we resorted to to-go the food isn't ready an hour later, understanding is no longer there.
On a positive note the lucilles in orange county is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Lucille's is the best BBQ in Vegas. I love the atmosphere and the general good nature of the place. I have come here on business and with friends."}
{"text":"Having eaten here twice my last review I can confidently say that 9 times out of 10 the BBQ here was amazing, even for someone who loves good barbecue.  Even when it's mediocre (in my demanding opinion) it's pretty damn good. 

Just a warning to the barbecue layman: there is bones in the barbecue as is the custom in many barbecue traditions. They are usually edible (not the rib bones obviously) but this is BBQ tradition and not Lucille's laziness. Lucille's is not lazy.

Protip: The burgers might actually be better than the barbecue. THEYRE AMAZING.
2nd Protip: The Garlic Mashed Potatoes are cooked by angels and then flown down from heaven. That's the only explanation for them."}
{"text":"I hold a business meeting at  Lucilles BBQ on a monthly basis so I am well versed in their restaurant.

I think their food is great!  To be honest, their type of barbecue doesn't float my boat, it's a spicy dry rub, but all of the guys in the group enjoy it!

My favorite food on the menu is the garden burger with fresh roasted veggies.  I've also enjoyed the mac and cheese, sliders, salads and more.  I also really like the fried green tomatoes.  I don't know where you can get those in Arizona.

The servers are usually a little slow, every time.  I''ve been served someone else's drink when asked for a refill.  (I had diet coke, they gave me someone else's iced tea.)  It takes them several mentions to get drinks or turn down the music.  I don't think our group is that big, only 12, but these guys usually can't get the hang of it.

Other than that though, it's good, clean and enjoyable food!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Who knew this place next to \"the mall\" had such great bbq?  

My new favorite place to meet someone in north Tempe."}
{"text":"I don't really have many bad things to say about this place.  The ribs are great, the bbq chicken is great, and so are the other types of meat like brisket and such.  I've had real southern cooking, and it's not quite exactly the same, but it's good nonetheless.  The portions are huge.  The sweet tea is delicious.  My only small complain are some of their sides sound really good, but taste plain and bland.  The service is good.  I like their biscuits and apple butter which is awesome.  They also have extra sauce on the table if you need some more which a lot of people still use except for me."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state and came across Lucille's and thought we'd give it a try.  Since we are from the midwest, we waited to sit outside to enjoy the Arizona warm weather.  We waited for approximately 20 minutes which wasn't bad.  Restaurant was fairly crowded but we sat in an area outside of the bar which was very comfortable.  

Service was just ok, seemed like she took a long time to initially greet us and then to refill drinks.  Our party of three ordered fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and for dinner - tri-tip sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, chicken dinner.  Sides included corn bread and sweet potato fries. My husband felt that the corn bread was some of the best he's ever had.  All in all, our food deserved 5 stars.  When visiting Phoenix again, we would definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been here many times over the last few years and I absolutely love it. It has the best happy hour specials. First, the happy hour goes until 7pm, which is awesomely late for a happy hour, and then it continues again at 9pm. Appetizers are between $4-6 and are basically small plates--delicious and filling, and not just frozen mozzarella sticks thrown in the fryer. Quite a lot of drink specials as well--beers and specialty cocktails both on the happy hour list.

A couple of times I have had Tobi for a server and she is amazing! Genuinely happy to be there, and not the trolling-for-tips kind of \"happy to be there.\" Parking is always great, right behind the restaurant. One of my favorite places in Henderson, even though it is a (small) chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a shoutout to Melissa, our bartender and chef AnnaMarie who cooked our fabulous dinner. I've been in the service industry for 2 decades and it's not often you have a completely enjoyable experience on the fun side of the bar. Melissa provided seamless service with a sense of professionalism and urgency. She is very personable, articulate and has a great sense of humor. She made me killer drinks while Anna Marie made us the \"Jambalaya me-oh-my-a\" and Blackened Catfish which was to die for. I highly recommend this joint especially if these lovely ladies are working. Thanks for the experience and will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Fun location, huge portions, and a Tootsie Roll pop to top off the meal.

I debated 3 or 4 stars for Lucille's. I had settled on 3.5 stars and was trying to decide whether to round up or down. Although I had initially decided to go with 3 stars simply as a matter of the pricing (it's on the pricey side, despite portion sizes), I went with rounding up for a couple of reasons: First, I have a lot of good memories of dining here. I have eaten here several times, and every time I have, it's been with my family. My brother gets excited about coming to this place, and I always enjoy myself when I'm here. Second, there are Tootsie Roll Pops as the after-dinner treat sitting near the hostess stand. I'm a bit of a sucker for Tootsie Roll Pops, so maybe this is a bit of a biased review. That said, I'll do my best to describe my experiences here.

The location is a lot of fun. There are a number of rooms to the place, and it goes on for a while. There are some enclosed patio areas that make you feel a little like you're dining on the patio of a house. There is actual outdoor seating as well, and they enclose it with some heaters when it cools off during the winter. There is a bar with TVs, so it's good for watching sports events. And there are a bunch of posters and other little trinkets up on the wall to give it some character. If nothing else, there are a few conversation starters in the place.

The service has always been decent. There is usually a bit of a wait on busy nights, but they will take your number and text you when it's your turn, so you can wander around Tempe Marketplace a bit while you're waiting. The service is generally attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. It can sometimes take a while to get your food here, especially when it's busy. I think we may have waited for close to 30 minutes the last time I was here after ordering. But then again, I didn't look at my watch, so this is just a guess based on how hungry I was.

While you wait for the entree, they bring out some delicious biscuits with honey butter. This is a great little (or not so little) snack while you're waiting for the main show. I could probably make a meal out of these things alone, but I try to resist eating too much of them before I get my food. There are a number of good appetizers as well. I've had the fried okra and a few other items--all good. But this last time, we had the BBQ chips, and I must say that I really enjoyed them. I am not normally a big potato chips fan, but these were freshly made and delicious! They come out with some Ranch for dipping, but they're good to me just plain.

Finally, the entrees. These are all big servings, so be prepared to eat. While they have a number of BBQ options (all pretty decent, with lots of side options--they pass the brisket test for me, and that's my favorite BBQ option), I'd suggest going for some of the Southern specialties. The fried chicken and mashed potatoes are particularly good. The catfish, both in fried and blackened form, is a great choice as well. I've tried a number of the entrees here, and I haven't gone wrong yet. The food isn't fantastic, but it's pretty solid.

Honorable mention: The teas they serve here are quite delicious. Both the peace and watermelon iced teas are really refreshing, and I'm not typically a fan of iced tea.

I'll keep coming back, but not on a regular basis because of the price. It's an experience here."}
{"text":"Here in town on vacation with the family. We were meeting with a family friend who lives in the area. We asked where is a good place to eat. First place he said was Lucille's. We walked in and saw the smoker and I was sold. I had the brisket platter. The brisket was a little tough, but still good. The sides of mac and cheese and cornbread were amazing. And the prices were very reasonable for the food served. Next time I am back in vegas, I will be stopping in again."}
{"text":"My mom had the turkey burger and I had the bbq chicken salad and we both got food poisoning from dining here and have been sick for the past three days. To say the least, we will NOT ever be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I would like to say my husband and myself went out for diner.  The hostess was rude.   The waiter John was awesome.  The food was excellent.  I have doubts i will be back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas. If you are looking for a consistently good BBQ spot, Lucilles is the way to go. They have incredible food, large portions and the most amazing apple butter and biscuits you can imagine. It is a little pricey, but you are paying for what you get; amazing bar-b-que."}
{"text":"I love that they still give you biscuits and apple butter at the start! Friendly servers as usual and we didn't have to wait long, even though it was busy. They had a new chicken entree on the menu and it was a very generous portion with two sides. I'd definitely order the same again!"}
{"text":"Back porch Strawberry Lemonade. Get one! or 2 ;) 
I'm a lightweight & even mixed drinks that have too many types of alcohol tend to drop me, but this one was PERFECT. Vodka, triple sec, strawberry lemonade & a splash of soda (I'm guessing Sprite). The first sip packed a little punch, but after that every drink tasted better than the last! I like that :D 

For appetizers our group ordered Fried Green Tomatoes & Fried Pickles to share, both were yummy!  

As a main dish I got a small plate of Gumbo with Cornbread. The cornbread had a cake texture, not my fav. The gumbo was good, nice texture, perfect amount and combination of meats (sausage, chicken, shrimp), but it was a bit on the salty side. It seems that to even out the saltiness they used pepper. I smelled it before I tasted, so it was quite a bit of pepper. I've pretty much spent the rest of the day trying to hydrate, lol! But it did clear my sinuses right up! I think I'll try something different next time :)

The service was good, the location was nice (we sat out on the lovely Southern style porch) & at lunch time (12:30 pm) we didn't have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Great vibes and service! I ordered the 10oz Brisket and it was delicious! Also their happy drink menu does not disappoint! I was only let down by their gumbo which was too thick and coleslaw which lacked flavor. Also the bar seats are pretty uncomfortable! I will be returning and trying a different meal though because the meat was a 10!"}
{"text":"I love the fried pickles that's the reason I came to Lucille's however I do have to say the sliders (pull pork) are delicious!! 

My server make me fell welcome from the moment she said hello, even when she knew I was waiting for the rest of party and they were running very late she was on point kudos to her she is actually the reason  I'm giving a five star 3 for food and ambiance and two extra for Wendy ( my server) btw happy hour is great, prices are good and portions big!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go!
Poor service very slow and Cold food
Very disappointed
Mac and cheese should be hot and gooey. I put my fork in and picked up the whole dish stuck together it was cold and old. The garlic mash potatoes were less than room temperature.
Biscuits only where delivered after my food came and only because I asked. 
Than i asked to talk to the manager and explained what happened. She seemed not to care her response was did you want me to heat the side dishes? You think? Wow

Would never go there again.

Ps the bbq sauce was blah. So if you like cold, plain food go there.  Tasteless...

If I could give less than a one star I would."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ i've ever had! Great place if you have a large party they are extremely accommodating!"}
{"text":"Good place for comfort BBQ and a fun environment. Fried pickles and Happy Hour menu are a must!"}
{"text":"Great bbq. Really bad service. I was shocked. Forgot our appetizer, didn't bring the right sides, never checked on us, didn't apologize for the mess up. But, did give us free dessert. Will come back for the food and will review again. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Lucille's, but I feel like there is a problem every time. Last night we had to send back tea for a spoiled taste and the biscuits for a bad taste as well. The manager was super nice and agreed both were off. Then with my sandwich, I got mashed potatoes as a side. And I asked for gravy on the side vs. on top. I was surprised when I got the bill that there was a $2 charge for gravy. Mashed potatoes and gravy are traditionally served together, and our server never mentioned an upcharge. Overall, disappointing experience. I'm not sure how long I'll continue to be a customer if they don't make some improvements."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious. I have no complaints about the food; however, the service was ridiculous! I was there for Valentine's day with my boyfriend. We were enjoying the nice weather and were having our lunch. Although we were still eating, our waitress came to our table twice and asked if we needed any boxes for our left over. We told her that we were still eating and will call her whenever we were ready to get our boxes if we needed any. The third time, she didn't even ask us if we needed anything. she straight ahead brought us the check. It was so annoying! there were free tables around us and it was not near closing time so there's no way that I can justify their bad service. Never going back there regardless of their tasty BBQ."}
{"text":"Still one of my best places in town for beef ribs and their courtesy biscuits are to die for. Friendly staff and great service. Our waiter Alfonso was the best!"}
{"text":"We've visited both locations multiple times as this is our go-to place for BBQ. The food has always been amazing at both locations. However, the customer service at this location ALWAYS sucks! I don't know if we have bad luck or if all the wait staff at this location just aren't very good. 

If you visit this location, expect great food and poor service."}
{"text":"The worst food poisoning experience I ever encountered I experienced following a trip to Lucilles!    I was there November 3rd for Monday night football and as it was a little chilly outside I decided to have some corn chowder soup.   The waiter who took our order was brand new as the woman behind him mentioned that as he took our order.  I got the soup with cornbread and should have said something about how it wasn't that hot and tasted a little off.   The way he served it with an uncertain look should have been a sign.   
That night I encountered the worst level of food poisoning ever which carried for a few days. I will spare the review from being descriptive but I don't wish my worst enemy to experience what i went thru.    
When I finally had enough energy to call them (not being able to eat anything at all for days) i called to speak to the manager who rushed me to expect a call from HR later that day.   It was a day later and instead of asking if I'd like to see a doctor, she told me she would call in a few days.   That never happened and instead I got a gift card from them....    I wouldn't consider going back and called the HR woman telling her how disgusted I was on how sending a gift card was there way of handling after throwing up for days and being as sick as I was (I should have been in the hospital).  She said I would get called over the next day or two by her supervisor as well as the insurance company...  
Her supervisor never called and today the insurance company called and basically told me they wont do anything making me feel like a victim with all their questions.   
I tried calling to speak to the owner, got the HR person again and I'm done feeling like a victim.  
I've contacted the board of health based on getting food poison following being there and if you also got food poisoning following going to Lucilles I'd recommend you do the same!   
If I could give negative stars I would!"}
{"text":"Are you hungry for some barbecue and southern food? Lucille's is a great place to satisfy your hankerin'.

To get it out in the open, if you're looking for cheap barbecue this is not the place for you to come. While I wouldn't call Lucille's overpriced, it definitely isn't cheap.    

I am a big fan of their baby back ribs and their fried catfish.  There isn't much on the menu here that isn't good. Some of their menu items are good, though, but not great. They're good because they are tasty and delicious, but I wouldn't classify some of them as great because to me they lack that authentic homestyle Southern flare. It's good and Southern, just not good and southern like granny used to make. 

What keeps them from being 4 stars? Their pricing. I think their prices could be a little lower. But their prices are not unfair. Also, their lack of hushpuppies is disturbing. When I go in for Southern food, I want some hushpuppies!!! 

The customer service here is usually great; have not had a bad experience yet. Do expect a wait sometimes to be seated. 

Would I come back here? I'm sure I will be back again. I really do like this place, just wish they would make a few small changes.

Would I recommend this place to others? Yes."}
{"text":"The valley isn't great for BBQ, but there are plenty of better options out there.  To other chains and even the tiny little strip mall joints.  Lucille's prices their BBQ on the same level of a Wood Ranch so I was expecting high quality meat, sides, and everything else.  Instead, the end product was far far far lower than Famous Dave's (though a dinner at Dave's would have been 30% cheaper for two, and better).  If Lucille's was in Mesa Riverview and not the always busy Tempe Marketplace, it would be out of business.  

First the sides:  The beans were fairly bland (and almost cold), shoestring fries were decent, Mac N Cheese extremely subpar.  I had the Beef Brisket sandwich, fiance had the tri tip sandwich.  The brisket tasted like Jerkey.  Worse then jerkey.  I was expecting some tender meat (as brisket should be) not this garbage I could barely bite into.  The tri-tip was good enough.  

This place was so just so... ugh.  For one of the more expensive casual BBQ places in town, it is easily one of the worst."}
{"text":"The wait was a little longer than what we were quoted. Our server Michael was excellent. He was very attentive to our needs. The food was great. Quality food and large portions. Price level was on the higher end considering there are many BBQ places in the valley that's cheaper and just as good. It's worth a try but due to the price, I'd probably go to the cheaper alternatives more often."}
{"text":"Only real BBQ in summerlin area . Cute restaurant / good service . Try the fried pickles. My kids love the strawberry lemonade ."}
{"text":"Service was great and food was great! I was visiting from out of town and found the Tempe  Marketplace which had several restaurant choices; BBQ sounded good. I ended up eating lunch here two days in a row.  

Tried the lunch two meat platter with baby back ribs and tri tip and cheesy grits as a side.  Meat was extremely tender, great smoked favor and the bbq sauce and the mop sauce were really good. Loved the cheesy grits! Biscuits were great too.

Went back  Saturday for lunch and was disappointed to find no lunch specials on the weekend. Due to the price of two items at regular pricing I chose only the baby back ribs. For sides I chose potato salad  and the honey peanut slaw. Potato salad was o.k., but the peanut  slaw was great! It's a vinegar based slaw and reminds me of an Asian type slaw with a little sweet and a little sour.

I've had a lot of BBQ around the states and this is one of my favorites.

Service was great,"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for bbq! But you have to come during lunch special hours!:-) their bbq is amazing, they have the best sweet rolls with Apple butter and great sweet tea. If I could, I'd eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ in Vegas. I have been going there for years. They are always consistant with their dishes and their service. 

If you are craving BBQ this is the spot. Usually I get the beef ribs or the sirloin steak. Most of the time I don't finish and always take home for lunch the next day. Portions are very big. Still worth the trip from Summerlin.

Be carefull the smell slaps you silly from the parking lot!"}
{"text":"It is okay. Not as good as I remember it and over priced in my opinion. The staff is always helpful though and the location is great, close to home and makes for a great place to do lunch or dinner and then walk around afterwards, they also have great drinks!"}
{"text":"I used to not be a fan of this place but the last time I was here I really did enjoy my experience.  Yes, the interior is absolutely fabulous. Very southern home-like, I passed the porch area on the way to the bathroom and I felt like I was in Georgia. You can see in my picture it has whicker-furniture with a few rocking chairs.  Get my drift? I had the strawberry lemonade served in those mason jars. Very delish and the jar adds to that southern touch.  Just like everyone mentioned they probably serve some of the best biscuits, which is something I look forward to each time I come here.  I also love the fact they're pretty much unlimited and this visit I had 2. Wow not so good on my waist line considering the apple butter is amazing as well.  We came during lunch time so I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes.  The sandwich was pretty tasty, good amount of BBQ sauce on it. I really like the crunch from the onion strings and I also like the fact they have a quarter of a pickle on the side. The mashed potatoes were okay, but nothing to do back flips over. The only downer about this place it's kinda pricey, but I suggest to go during lunch making it more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Aah may zing!!!! From the corn chowder to the biscuits to the ribs, mac n cheese & greens...I tried so much here that I'm a little embarrassed yet proud at the same time, and I loved it all. Service was great too! And whoever thought of that jalapeño tartar sauce needs to be kissed. Oh wait! Did I also mention the fried chicken w/ mashed potatoes & fabulous green beans? The grits & fried catfish were also great. I'm watching my figure so I only had the red velvet cake for dessert. It was the most moist cake I ever had."}
{"text":"Ok. I'll give credit where credit is due.

I went back to Lucille's on Monday evening (06/24/2013) at the behest of a very special person. He knows who he is and I must say, hats off to you sir for caring so much.

My husband and I were extremely skeptical, but were expecting another flavor explosion and culinary button busting bliss as per usual when it comes to Lucille's and that fantastic kitchen of theirs. Again we expected the service to, well, suck.

Not the case.

Lucille's has taken on a Captain Planet-like \"LET'S COMBINE POWERS!\" attitude. Gasp! They've become a team! One that seats within SECONDS of a hunger crazed mutan-- I mean client, walking in the door! 

Drink order came 5 minutes later, arrived on the table 5 minutes after that. And boy oh boy that strawberry lemonade is the bee's knees. Seriously. It's summer time in a mason jar, sweet and tart and I swear you can practically find yourself sitting on an old wrap around porch in a rocking chair after a few sips. Nectar of the Southern Gods. Hallelujah!

We then ordered our customary half an artichoke and just about died and went to heaven. There's something about BBQ sauce on roasted artichoke that catches the smoke and flavor of the entire establishment and then dipped in that garlic mayo? Yuuuuummmm.

Hubby surprised me this time. He ordered the Cobb Salad. Granted it was piled high with egg and chicken and bacon. He dug in, could only finish half -- two hours later at home he killed the rest of it and was quite pleased with himself. Only complaint there? It took 15 minutes after receiving the salad for him to receive his requested oil and vinegar, but no sweat. It was busy.

Me? Southern Fried Chicken all the way. I think there's a growing trend with me, and it has a lot to do with chicken. Love chicken. Especially fried chicken that's done right. Crispy, juicy but not greasy? Oh I'm so there.  Lucille's delivered. The chicken was PERFECT. And we already know how I feel about their squash medley and garlic mashed taters. Heaven. On a plate. I only finished half and then tortured my office with the other half at lunch the next day.

So Lucille's? Great job. I'm incredibly impressed and absolutely tickled pink by your budding success. I hope this is a progressive trend and y'all keep up with it. 

I'll so be back."}
{"text":"I have tried the location in Green Valley as take out only and really wasn't all that impressed with the food, but after hearing of other people's good experiences I decided to give it another go. What could be better, they have since opened a newer location (August 2013) much closer to my location in Red Rock, so it was easy to get to and a straight shot from my house.

Lucille's has two happy hours per day, and I was coming for their 9 till close option. I got there a bit early and hung out at the bar till 9, not an issue. When 9pm rolled around, we decided to move to a table, and I found out you HAD to sit in a special section only for it, odd but ok. 

Wait staff was nice, but each one had some flaw that was a bit offputing. This evening I went each person had a habit of either talking down about their employer or it's food, which is a bit worrysome if you are just sitting down to eat and somebody has been saying some unsavory things that WORKS there.

The happy hour menu had a pretty good selection. We ordered drinks (which are also discounted) and found that one after the other we tried were not very strong and mostly syrup. I hope their full priced versions are a bit better, I kept my choices of drinks to a minimum. Everything tasted alright, but more commercially prepared and not something I would find myself coming back for. Wait staff was friendly, but our server did disappear from his section for a while. Each server introduced themselves as \"hi my name is \"x,\" and I'll be your server until \"y\" get's back from her break. We ended up having like three servers during the course of the night. 

The complaints I have are minor, but after time even 2-3 minor items can add up to a less then perfect evening. Would I come back...maybe. Would I suggest to others...probably not. Not bad if you don't have all that many expectations. It was simply ok, just very unorganized and servers/bartenders seemed young and just there for a paycheck."}
{"text":"The food was great but I found the price way too high.  I wanted the beef ribs but I will not pay $22.99 for 3 beef ribs.  The food deserves a higher star rating but between the high prices and the 45 minute wait I was not really happy.  I smoked my own ribs the next night for 4 people for not much more than the cost of 1 meal at this place.  Its nice for a night out but you won't be able to afford the movie after, LOL."}
{"text":"This is way over due. My husband and I came back about a month ago for dinner. All I can say is YUMM!! I apologize in that I do not remember our servers name, but he really was fantastic. He was blonde, with half shaved head, hair in a ponytail and glasses. He recently turned 21 and recommended the Lemon Drop Martini. I'm a huge fan of lemon drops and Lucille's is one of the best indeed. The food was also superb this time, but honestly our server made the whole experience. We will now be back again. This time, because we want to, not because we have a \"Guest Recovery Gift Card!\" Way to turn things around!!"}
{"text":"Ok service. The Jameson Mule had no lime juice in it, my ribs were way too overcooked. Besides that everything was awesome. Great steak, cornbread, apple butter & biscuits, and corn"}
{"text":"Ash is the worst server. Service was terrible. We came in around 9, knew exactly what we wanted, and would have been out by the time they closed which is 10. We come often to the other location. First she told us she had no salt when we got our salads. Saying that they dump out all of the salt that night. Wouldn't you keep some knowing your restaurant still had people in it? Next they had no mash or corn. Never really came to our table. She had a major attitude like we were bothering her. Lastly asked us if we wanted dessert. There were 3 of us and we would have all ordered our own. Comes back 10 minutes later and tells us the kitchen is closed so we can't order dessert. That was right at ten when they closed. Absolutely ridiculous. She just wanted to leave. She should have told us the kitchen was closing instead of offering us dessert and telling us we can't have it. Horrible service. DO NOT get her as a server."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING BBQ PLACE!!! My Love and I LOVE to eat at Lucille's Smokehouse. We always get the Ribs and Chicken plate to share. He Loves the Ribs & I Love the Chicken(white meat only.) That comes with Two sides to share. We Enjoy the Potato Salad and their yummy Baked Beans that are so Delicious, and last but not to forget to mention their Amazing Apple Cinnamon Butter and Biscuits!!! There are always xtra food to take home and enjoy the next day."}
{"text":"Came to have dinner here Wednesday evening, had a half rack of baby back ribs, French fries, and Cole slaw. The food was great but I was more impressed by the fries, really excellent. The strawberry lemonade was just the best I've had in a long time. I'm definitely coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Note: I only give out 5 stars to surprisingly EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.

The portions here are absolutely huge.  Appetizers can be large enough to accommodate a reasonable lunch portion, and salads can be large enough for two full portions.  Some choices are offered in half portions.  Fountain drinks arrive in a large mason jar.  At first, I wondered why the glass was so huge.  Then I realized it's a matter of convenience for the server so he/she won't have to run back & forth for constant refills. The bisuits are delicious with just a touch of sweetness to them.  The apple butter is technically not true apple butter, but it's delicious.  

The food is delicious, and service is good.  Our server was quite friendly, and service was spot on.  The hot towel provided at the end of our meal was a particularly nice touch.  

Give Lucille's a try--it's worth a reasonable wait time and you won't be disappointed!  It's good, but not exceptional.  In my opinion, I would consider giving a 5-star review if Lucille's reduced the sizes--and accordingly, the prices--of their fare.  Reasonable portions at reasonable prices would fit the Southern BBQ joint motif better."}
{"text":"Only 2 stars, because the food was amazing. Just terrible service. Starting off on the wrong foot. Our server literally threw the coaster at my father. He was so irrate and ready to throw it right back at her, we had to calm him down. I told her, you can get away with throwing coasters possibly to the younger people at the table, but my father doesn't like that, and I asked her not to do it again. I still tipped her well. I will go again, but I know my parents never will. Next time I am also going to speak with the manager."}
{"text":"Love this place, great food and really friendly staff, we always ask for Kristy as she is a smiling sweet girl who makes you feel good while eating good food!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife decided to give this place another go. This time I gave them 5 stars. I must have went on a one off day. The service was great and the food was superb. The fried pickles are a must."}
{"text":"The service at this establishment is absolutely dreadful!  They can't manage this restaurant to any degree what so ever.  We made reservations for 6:30 PM tonight for a party of six and literally waited until 7:25 PM before we got seated.  Took an additional 10 minutes just to see our server.  When we did the see server I made him wait to take our order right then and there in fear I would never see him again.

It's a real shame too, because despite the bad service the food is actually really good.  However, this is now my second visit and I'd have to be a crazy lunatic to come here again, because the 2 hours I lost will never be recouped ever again.  You shouldn't have to wait, wait, and wait even more...hire some more staff, get a server outside, DO SOMETHING but be ignorant to patrons.  I'm usually a 30% tipper, but all the way around it was just awful.  Will never come back here again and tell everyone I know how bad service is here."}
{"text":"Come On Cowboys, Put Your Jeans, boots, Shirts On!

Time to take the suits off and have a outing!

Lets Have a B-Que!

This place is so Delicious!  Been there a few times! Consistency Is Awesome!

The staff is professional, happy, and care about the customers needs! The atmosphere is fitting for the food!

OMG -  I feel like i am up at a camp out around the grill \"smell the food\" eating the great foods that B-Que brings!

Rolls, chicken, corn on the cob, potatoes, and a nice cold beer!  \"Heaven\" The selection is awesome for all who go!

I love the rolls, yum, they are so scrumptious and tasty. 

All should go and enjoy, family, friends, co-workers and Hot Dates!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of barbecue. Eating large slabs of meat with a garnish of cole slaw doesn't have much appeal for me. Don't get me wrong, I love my protein, but a well executed salad is more up my alley. 
The partner wanted the sampler so I gave in and shared it with him. I didn't care for the ribs and brisket, but the barbecue chicken was by far one of the best barbecue chickens I've ever had. It was moist and went well with my adult lemonade. 
The most surprising part of my adventure in meat land was the service. It was really great! I didn't catch his name but he was full of recommendations, honest with his feedback and he even brought a small bowl of cherries for my niece who only wanted cherries and nothing off the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Nah, man. I don't like this place. I don't like this joint at all. 

I do not like the food. I do not like the near-deafness I was threatened with just for going to the restroom (more on that later). I do not like the horrendously bad service. 

Food
It sucks. It fucking sucks! One-star level of food here, no hyperbole. (Well, maybe a little.)

Now, I am no goddamn expert on barbecue (I have only made pilgrimages to Austin, KC, Memphis, and Nashville for barbacoa though, and actually saw firsthand how all originally derived in a Taíno reserve), but what I have been served here at Lucille's was simply not good food. 

Did not taste good, did not look good; made me want to strive to become vegan. If I were forced to eat all of my meat exclusively from Lucille's, or of a Lucille-like quality, I would become vegan. No bullshit. I would basically become Morrissey. 

Service
The one waiter we had did not (a) know what was it that came with the largest pre-packaged combo on their own menu -- like no shit ... had no clue at all -- ; and (b) did not bring everything that was supposed to come with the combo from their very own menu after studying it at fucking length! Sucks.

Ambiance
I have been to Heavy Metal concerts that were kinder to my hearing. And I have also been to private invite events at Wynn fucking Resorts that had less pretentious yuppies than Lucille's in The District at GVR, Henderson, NV, U.S.A.. 

Dude, turn down the fucking volumes on those goddamn amps in the bar; this is not an arena or Lollapalooza. It is a fucking restaurant!

Epilogue
Overpriced. And it sucks. The holy duo for I-won't-be-caught-dead-in-this-shithole-again for me. That is just me; this might be the greatest eats you have ever had in your life for you though. We are all different, after all. - E

Postscript. There should be another noise level choice: \"Airplane Engines Right Next To Your Fucking Ears Loud\" in between \"Very Loud\" and \"Not Sure[.]\""}
{"text":"The place reminds me of the House of Blues.  The menu offerings are fantastic.  There's lots of combo options allowing you to taste a bit of everything.

This place could be great, but there a couple of reasons why it doesn't hold four stars.  

I don't normally pay mind to the service.  But it is very business like here.  From the hostesses to the managers, I never saw a smile.  The customer almost feels like he's intruding or being a bother.

The beef ribs were beautiful and plentiful, but really hard to eat.  Way too much sinew, marble, and who knows what else.  The sauce was sickening sweet.  And it was all just plain too greasy.  My teeth were throbbing and screaming for floss afterwards.  The rest of my party didn't like the ribs either.

The tritip was ok. It comes sliced and well done.  

I think the prices are more like three $$$, so, for me to come back, there might have to be some live music on their little stage."}
{"text":"Medicore, expensive - skip it

First impression the place seems great - like some down home house - but it feels a little phony. That's pretty much what you get as far as the food too.

I don't know if  you can get a entree that is under $14 bucks. You do get a lot of food and they have the approiate sides.

The brought out biscuit and they just tasted like flour. I thought I was smart and got the brisket - There was no smokey flavor - like someone else said it was just like a pot roast. Service was pretty good (did have to ask them for my other side that they forgot - their heart was in the right place). If their prices were more resonable they would get three stars."}
{"text":"Shenanigans.

This place is like \"Shenanigans\" from the movie \"Waiting.\"  You could call it a BBQ version of Chili's. It's run by kids who have no idea what quality guest service is. They all look so unhappy.  It appears as if each employee is waiting for the other to do whatever the task is. It wouldn't be so out of place if it wasn't connected to a beautiful resort. God knows what they are doing to the food. 

The one fall back they used to have was great live music, which they decided to discontinue..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fifties Diner food, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Lucy!  Oh, LUCY!

How many times have I tried to like you?  How many times was I let down?  My friends think you're so great, that it just makes breaking up so hard to do.

Are my expectations too high?  I don't think so.  I'm not expecting to fill the shoes of Red Apple Grill.  I been to Tony (Roma's) and (Famous) Dave's.  I've gone to Memphis (Championship). Heck, even Applebee's served up better...and was a really cheap date.

Maybe you're too saucy for me, always running here and there.  Or perhaps you just lack flavor, that certain je nais se quoi.  I don't know.  I've given you so many chances to impress me and to show me what you've got, but this is the last time.  I've pretty much given up on you.

Goodbye Lucy, I fare thee well."}
{"text":"I judge a bbq place by a couple of menu items.  First, hot links.  Lucille's are not good.  They're not hot and they're kinda mealy.  Second, beans.  Lucille's beans have too many other things in them.  Big chunks of undercooked veggies.  Not good."}
{"text":"Great spot with the casino.   Parking can be problematic on the weekend's due to traffic and the crowds.  It's one of the largest Lucille's I've been to, even compared to the ones in California.  The hostess and waiters are friendly and the service is fast.  One thing they could offer is lunch menus on the weekends, or at least on Saturday's. Not everyone wants a full size meal in the afternoon, and sometimes I don't want to resort to a burger just so I don't get a full size meal.  
At least the food is always great and the drinks too!  And who can resist their delicious biscuits and apple butter.  Absolutely scrumptious!"}
{"text":"My friend who used to live in Tempe suggested I eat here before I left. Great choice. We sat outside on the patio, which was extremely spacious. The bread with apple butter was fantastic! Our waiter was friendly and my food was AMAZING. I couldn't even finish everything and I'm a BIG guy. I ordered Lucille's Back Porch, which is a a combo platter of brisket, ribs (1 of 3 kinds), half-a-chicken and 2 sides. I picked their peanut slaw and greens, both seasoned well and super tasty. I recommend you to dine here for very decent BBQ. Then walk around the mall to burn off some of the calories. Lol."}
{"text":"I found this place when we needed a place to meet for a business lunch.  I had the smoked BBQ chicken which was good but that seems to be all I get when I go.  I've tried some of the other dishes but haven't really liked them.  My wife loves the fried pickles which I'm not a fan of.  The portions are huge but there does not seem to be anything special I can remember besides really large portions.  I suppose the biscuits topped with sugar smothered in honey butter are good but I also want to live to be at least 50 and they are not worth dying for.  As unimpressed as I am with the food, the service is very good.  I've been there a few times now and have always been pleased with they way they treat us.  Everything from the speed and attentiveness has been good."}
{"text":"Can I have more of their bread after this review? Lucille's has a variety of barbecue options and a great atmosphere. The Baby Back Ribs are juicy, flavorful, and I love the sauce options on top! Got the chance to try the Fried Chicken Sandwich. Really enjoyed it with ranch.. I mean when the chicken sandwiches are good, I'm always down to return to Lucille's! One con I could think of would be wait times! Was quoted 35 min, waited 55.. The food was delicious, but for the long wait and semi-high price, I'd come back maybe on a special occasion and look into if they have reservation options. But yeah, get some of the bread to go"}
{"text":"The burnt ends were great! I did not enjoy the mac n cheese or the potato salad. Waitstaff were very helpful and friendly. The menu is very pricy.  So be prepared. We would return for those burnt ends. Man o man!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Best BBQ I've had here in nv. This visit I got the BBQ chicken sandwich. So good! It had this wonderful smokiness to it and not to mention the huge portion!  It can get pricey but good food is worth it to me."}
{"text":"We decided to try Lucille's tonight with take out.  I did an online order this morning for pick up at 4:30 PM.  I was ten minutes early and it was ready yet which is good because it wasn't made ahead of time and sitting somewhere.  The online ordering was a big plus!!

I got an original pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac and cheese.  My wife got the Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of garlic mashed.  One of the problems with what I got was simply the fact that it's take out.  I live nearby, but pulled pork isn't boiling hot when it's placed in the bun and therefore it wasn't a hot sandwich and in fact wasn't warm.  Luke warm would be closer to the temperature of the meat.  The mac and cheese stayed warm.  I thought the sandwich was dry even though the menu says it's tossed in their special sauce.  Maybe I should have asked for some BBQ sauce to go.  There was no toss that I could discern.  The mac and cheese was very good.  My wife liked her sandwich although she thought it was very spicy hot.  She liked the garlic mashed side.

I guess I'm just not a BBQ person.  Nothing about BBQ blows my socks off.  If I came back to Lucille's, it would be for a dinner of mac and cheese.  I'll take international cuisines or a good steak before I'd get this.  There's one other BBQ place I need to try before I put a nail in my BBQ coffin and lower it in the ground.  The price/value just isn't there.  But, Lucille's is OK--Just."}
{"text":"Management needs to be replaced. Staffing is inexcusable. The place was 1/3 filled and we waited 20 mins for a seat,10 for ordering. The food is very good. The burnt ends are best,ribs very good. Sides very good. Moist brisket. No complaints at all with food. Drink prices are too high, thus ordered water on principle of it. Great place for station comps."}
{"text":"It's rare nowadays to receive excellent customer service as I did at the Phoenix Lucille's ,the young lady Savnnah did an amazing job on serving her customer she was prompt and polite!! 

If you want great service in a good environment please ask for Savannah!"}
{"text":"Baby back ribs with baked beans and sweet potato fries... and a peach lemonade.  Free tootsie roll pops on your way out."}
{"text":"I think the best way, for me, to describe Lucille's is \"It's Pretty Good.\" 
Let me preface, though. My mothers half of the family is super-country. I was raised by my grandma for my first 10 years of life, so I like to think I know how southern dishes are supposed to taste. They are literally from a town, in Kentucky, named Turkey Creek. How back woods is that? Therefore, my taste for Southern cooking is fine tuned, but I'm trying to loosen the reins a little bit while typing this review.

The restaurant is cute, the service is fine, and while the food is nothing to write home about, it's good. The hot towels at the end of our meal, were honestly the highlight for me. They were accommodating to our party of 20, and I don't think anyone had anything necessarily negative to say. 

For me, it was just missing SOMETHING. The meat wasn't as tender or flavorful as I would anticipate from a self-proclaimed \"smokehouse.\" The sauces were just alright. I'm comfortable with saying, they dropped the ball on their cornbread recipe. Those biscuits, though, they get a 10/10. I also thought everyone's flavored teas were pretty cute with the fruit floating in them.

Although it's a chain, I wish there were something that stood out to me to make me say, \"We should go to Lucille's.\" - Nothing crazy bad. I've just had better BBQ, in the valley, and at a shyer price point."}
{"text":"It's definitely a legit barbecue spot, but I think it's a little overrated.

I've been there enough times to go back but probably because friends wanna go there and it's one of the most well known barbecue spots. the last time I was there I had the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. (ballin on a budget). I mean, it was good, but it wasn't the greatness my mouth was expecting. I kept having to dip it in the barbecue sauce(s). I also ordered the sweet tea. I like my sweet tea so sweet that I feel like I'm gonna get diabetes any minute. Theirs was watered down or something.

On another note, the service provided the last time I went was sub par. They took forever to order and deliver our food. I wanted ice cream with my bread pudding and they.......

couldn't find the ice cream?
hunh.

Maybe it was a bad visit? Like I said, I've been there enough to where I'm willing to go back if someone else suggests it, but I'm not gonna be the one to throw out the suggestion."}
{"text":"Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ is a chain restaurant and it looks like it and tastes like it. It is very good, don't get me wrong, but it is not unique or original. If you want the best BBQ you will not find it here. But, it is super tasty for what it is and we like it very much.

There is only one that I know of in Nevada and it is this one in Henderson. The rest, I think, are around Los Angeles. Lucille's has a large menu and a great children's menu. I actually love the kid's menu and could just steal from our grandson, but I order the pork ribs and he tends to steal those while I eat his penne pasta with butter sauce. It is great, no kidding.

Lucille's has great biscuits and we love their onion rings. All the meats are quite good and you really can't go wrong. The service can be spotty and they need to work on that, but for the most part the service is friendly, and pretty fast. 

It can get very crowded and I personally would not wait to eat here, so we stick with showing up early for lunch when we are in town.

Have a great time."}
{"text":"M took T and I to the brand new Tempe Marketplace.  Walking through, it's such a scene: a place to see and be seen. That's great! A social and public space.  More places need to be like this.  In fact, it reminds me of the Irvine Spectrum more or less in Orange County.

We decided on Lucille's given time and that it seemed to be a good Arizona restaurant.  The irony: we learned that eight (8) of the 10 locations were located in California. Go figure.  We looked at the menu; we looked at the decor:  Joe's Crab Shack is to seafood as Lucille's is to BBQ.

We ordered a appetizer sampler, rib sampler, tri-tip wedge salad, and a bbq chicken salad. While I enjoyed the tri-tip salad, T stated the bbq flavor was nonexistent on her chicken salad.  Go figure.

So what do you expect from a chain?  It does its job to feed you and overstimulate you with decor and witty, though nice, staff and good, live music.  Don't mind the food, but the atmosphere is entertaining.  I really don't mind such places if I'm going there for happy hour or a quick meal - but you really shouldn't expect too much, it's a \"chain.\""}
{"text":"Staff was extremely friendly and service was fantastic. Food was ok. I had the pulled pork and I felt like it was a little dry. The complimentary biscuits were very hard on the outside (this may be some people's preference). Highlight - strawberry lemonade was very refreshing!"}

{"text":"I promised that I was going to give this place another try. It did not go well. We ordered the bbq chicken and the baby ribs. And of course the onion appetizer with the ranch because I absolutely loved that last time. So this is how it went:
We forget to add sides to the order, they called us and asked. They were polite and efficient. 5 stars.

The order was late but we were notified so still 5 stars.

The order arrived and OMG they forgot the ranch. The only item I loved last time. I wanted to cry. Seriously. 0 stars.

Ok. I pulled myself together and we tasted the food. The chicken was delicious. Not just the bbq sauce on it but the chicken itself. Back to 5 stars.

The rib was dry. And dry. Did I mention dry? 3 stars.

The sides were mediocre so they couldn't add much to the experience.

So here we are. 3 stars again. I tried. I really did."}
{"text":"This is an okay bbq restaurant.  It is a chain, I think of it as a Claim Jumpers that specializes in bbq.  The portions are HUGE, prices are reasonable and service is usually good.  The non-alcoholic drinks come in mason jars, so they don't have to fill up my ice tea as often.

The flavor is above average.  There are other bbq restaurants and chains that are more authentic and have better flavor.  But in the Las Vegas/Henderson area, this place isn't bad"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was pretty good (didn't realize they had a happy hour menu until AFTER we ordered). They give you these yummy rolls with light sugar on top with Apple butter (no charge) and its bomb!! We ordered the brisket appetizer. It was good, but the meat is too fatty. The half bbq chicken was really good and so was the Mac n cheese. They have a lot to pick from so overall we would return"}
{"text":"Great food. A tad pricey for BBQ and drinks though. $20 for 10oz beef brisket?! But you could cut it with your fork. I will be back."}
{"text":"I have eatten her since 2008 when I first moved here from out of state. This was one of the first places my husband took me for lunch when I moved here reminds me of home. I love this place! Food is always great.  The people have been more than welcoming,  What more could you want with a BBQ place. We even had our bachelor and bachelorette party here in October 2014.

8 years later. I still loved this place until this afternoon (3/28/2015). My husband and I went in and ask the host if we could have a booth.
 \"Of course walk this way\"
She took us to the back in the far back. My husband set down, immediately I was going to sit down but it was really warm from the location we were being seated in. I ask the host if we can sit in a different location. Closer to the hostess station it's cooler if you ever eaten here.  She said \"no that the rest of the seats were taken for reservations\" I asked if we could sit at the bar she says \" no all seats are taken for reservations\". At this point I knew what she was doing I told my husband that we are leaving and we would never come back and the host was like \"okay\".

I have never been so disgusted with somebody in my life. yes I am White female, and my husband is Hispanic  This host was playing out the race card!
I would have talk with the general manager (Tammy) and she was there.
But, it just not worth it anymore. Nobody in that establishment deserves my money or yours."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars ONLY because the food is GREAT! The service is less than par, have had better at McDonalds. There always seems to be chaos, even on a slow day during a slow time. The service is always slow, even when ordering only water. It takes 5 people to clear one table and even then takes them 20 minutes. Have made reservations in the past and they don't do any good. Still waited over an hour to be seated. We come back simply for the food. The Red Rock location is WAY BETTER."}
{"text":"The food and service was pretty good, but the best part of the experience is the complimentary biscuits and apple butter.  The chicken fried steak with the gravy is the best and my go to every time!!!  Also replacing the vegetables for a piece of cornbread is also a must, it's okay not to be healthy sometimes haha!! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop here yesterday for an early dinner and arrived around 5 PM. The place was pretty empty, so when the hostess asked us if we wanted a booth or table, I responded with: \"doesn't matter really, just a good spot.\"Well the spot she chose was a booth right next to their big smoker that was as hot as a furnace and radiating that heat big time! Coming in from 113 degrees, I knew we were never going to be able to sit there, so when the waiter came to the table I asked (very politely) if we could be moved. He said he would 'have to check with the front desk' and drifted away. Finally he came back and said we would have to move to a table and we said that's great! And of course he moved us right next to a table with a screaming baby. Payback I guess for asking....
Anyway, on to the food...
I have to say that I was a little taken aback by the lack of any 'early bird specials' on food or beverages. In this economy even Flemings is doing a great happy hour! We ordered ribs (I had the baby back and my husband had the St. Louis) The waiter said we had 2 sides and I asked for a salad. He said that was not one of the choices, and it would be $1.75 more. OK. So I finally decided on the garlic mashed potatoes and the beans. 
The biscuits they brought to start the meal were really good with the honey cinnamon butter. But only 2? Come on, be a little more generous. The salads arrived and they were pretty much the stock salad, nothing fabulous. Then the plates came, and I have to say the BBQ ribs were just OK. Nothing great, and kinda dry. And the sides were fine, but nothing to write home about. 
I don't think I would have been so disappointed if it weren't for the fact that the meal (along with 2 large beers and NO dessert) was $80 before tip! Come on, that is ridiculous. We can eat at Joes or Daves for half that. 
So....will I return? No, probably not. If I am going to spend $100 for dinner, I can go to the Keg just down the way a little and get a much better meal."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying...\"mmmmm yummy!\"

1 star = for the buttermilk biscuits!  They're so good, melt in your mouth type bread that is to die for.  I would probably come back here strictly for the bread.  Some people rave about the apple butter, but I think its flavorful with regular butter and just as delish!

2 stars = for the portions.  My boyfriend and I decided to share a 2 meat combo along with 2 sides and an appetizer of sweet potato fries.  It was more than enough.  We had left overs that I was able to bring for lunch the next day at work.  

3 stars = for the pulled pork.  HUGE portion, flavorful, and probably so good because it's probably so bad for you.  I had again the next day at lunch, put it in between 2 pieces of wheat bread for a pulled pork sandwich :D

4 stars = for the brisket!  Cooked to perfection, not dry, and juicy, but not raw.  It was flavorful, and even better when slightly dipped in their BBQ sauce.  So good, there were no left overs of this portion but was still enough for the two of us.

5 stars = for the sides.  The beans have sausage in it and has a little spicy kick to it. Yum!  The mac and cheese is ordinary but good, and good portion size too.  The corn!  Yum!  A full ear of corn, buttery, and good!

Overall, I had a great experience here.  Our waitress was attentive, the food was great, and the place has a bar too!

GO NOW! It is so yummy here!"}
{"text":"made reservations on a Saturday night for 6 adults and 2 kids and got there to be told that we were to wait another 1 hour..  if you are busy I get it but stop taking reservations then as you can't handle the volume and are completely unorganized. Won't be going back and will spread the word to all my family and friends also."}
{"text":"This food is amazing, I had given up on bbq food until I came here WOW. Art was our server and he was astounding with friendly and efficient service. 

Proportions: HUGE, YOU WILL HAVE LEFT OVERS

price: I got a two meat combo for 28 dollars but it came with HUGE beef ribs (three bones) and five pieces of tri tip, along with two sides. Also got an additional cup of clam chowder for 2.50 but that was also amazing.

Service: had Art who was just amazing in every way. He will get you anything you want or need.

Waiting time: took a long time although we came it at 630 pm on a Friday night so that was probably why it took like 35-40 minutes but IT'S WORTH IT.

atmosphere: really loud because of the live jazz music so hard to chat with everyone at the table but it was fun music and even was greatly set up so it didn't feel crowded or anything. 

QUALITY: this food is amazing especially the beef ribs, they are huge and tender and delicious and you get their homemade bbq sauce selection and the best one was the smokey sauce. 

Overall I will not only be coming back ALOT but this has become at least my second favorite restaurant and will be bringing everyone I know and recommending it to any tourist who asks. YOU NEED TO EAT HERE"}
{"text":"I can consider myself a regular here now.  Three out of the last four visits have been spot on.  There's another spot in Vegas with better BBQ but Lucille's can hold it's own versus every other BBQ place in town.  

There are three BBQ sauces on the table and you can pick and choose what you want.  I usually blend all three together and make one badass BBQ sauce.  I change up my orders every time but the briskets and tri tips are good.  My last order was the half chicken and two meats, they were dry this time so ehhh but the other times I've had Lucille's it was so finger licking good. 

Let me tell you how to get here though, it looks weird on the Yelp map.  Head south from Green Valley Parkway and make your first right into the District then make a left and go around to the immediate right.  You'll see it!

The happy hour is only for the bar or bar area, so feel free to just sit in this section rather than wait for a table on the right side of the restaurant or outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"Glad to have a Lucille's in the opposite side of town from the Henderson location and right next to other restaurants inside Red Rock Casino so to give us more dining option.  But why do they consistently not have bread ready to go, it usually comes out with the entrees or right before the entree is served.

Not necessarily the best BBQ out there, I prefer to go \"rollin\" elsewhere but these are still prepared well.  I only get ribs when I go to BBQ places so I'm not sure if the other items are just A-Ok."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to the Lucille's in Green Valley Ranch for the longest time, but it's just so far away.  Was happy to hear Lucille's would be opening much closer to my neck of the woods at Red Rock Casino.  Finally visited on my stepdaughter's 21st birthday for dinner.

Gotta say right off the bat...not very impressed.  I mean, for all the fancy décor, just average BBQ?  I have no need for that.  I know it's a chain (and a big one at that) but I don't really care for a pleasant atmosphere usually, for me it's about taste and portions!  Especially with BBQ.  I don't mind eating in a po-dunk, out-back, no-utensils kinda place if the que' is legendary.  Really, I don't.  Lucille's just isn't that kind of place.  But at least they use mason jars for your drinks!

After being seated (and boy was the place packed) we went straight to menu lookin'.  After ordering our drinks-in-mason-jars (makes me wish I got moonshine) we started off with an appetizer of BBQ Pork Nachos.  They arrived after about 20 minutes and looked really good.  Nacho chips topped with smoked BBQ pork, BBQ sauce, cheese (some shredded, some that was more like canned nacho cheese), black beans, pico de gallo, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole.  This dish was actually pretty good and hit on all the right spots - crunchy, gooey, smoky, salty, crispy, tangy, sweet, warm, and cool.  Flavor was great with the smoke coming from the BBQ pork, very well complemented.  These nachos were just enough to whet our appetite for our main courses.  We had to wait for our actual dinner courses longer than we did for our appetizer (I was assuming good que' takes some time).  

The birthday girl had the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portabello Sandwich.  Angus beef smoked, with portabello mushrooms, red onions, jack cheese, and garlic mayo on thick slices of sourdough.  It was a good sandwich, and that garlic mayo gave it a nick kick.  They messed up on her side of fries though, so a new order had to be brought out.  

The little one ordered from the kids menu and had the quarter rack of Finger Licken' BBQ Ribs with a side of macaroni & cheese.  What kid doesn't like mac & cheese?  Mine does.  But this one from Lucille's?  Not on par at all.  It was watery, and not very cheesy, in fact it was pretty bland.  Hardly cheese-tastic at all.  I mean she's not too picky, and loves the fake stuff from the blue box!  So for her not to finish this mac & cheese was a big statement.  She did like her ribs though, but the serving was just too small and she was left hungry (even after the nachos).  

The wifey had probably the best dish of the night, 5 bones of the BBQ Beef Ribs.  Make room, cause the suckers are HUGE!  Like mini-dinosaur bones!  The beef ribs are rubbed, slow-smoked, then finished off on the grill with Lucille's original BBQ sauce.  I had one and they were GOOD.  Meaty, cooked long enough so the meat comes off the bone with just a little bit of give.  Smoky for sure, and good with the BBQ sauce finish.  Her sides?  She wasn't impressed.  The sweet potato fries were just ok, and the Southern Braised Greens were lacking.  Either not cooked long enough or not enough flavor added to the pot, there were super bland.

I wasn't jumping for joy with my dish, the St. Louis Spare Ribs.  I don't mind Baby Back Ribs, but they are way too small looking for a guy like me.  I want more meat, so give me the bigger rib!  My order came out and I was like 'Huh?'  Didn't I order St. Louis style?  I asked our waitress and she said they were St. Louis.  I'm no expert, but either these were Baby Back Ribs and you were lying to me, or you cut the ends of my St. Louis ribs way too short.  Where are the ends of my ribs?  Look at the pic your self and see.  I felt ripped off to say the least.  If they tasted good I guess it would have made up for it.  But these 'St. Louis' ribs were not the best I've had.  They were dry, and the smoke on them were barely noticeable.  The BBQ sauce on them didn't help either, all it did was coat them in what was now too-sweet ribs.  Disappointing.  I can finish off a rack of ribs myself, but I saved half of these for home.

I think the worst thing we had though was Lucille's homemade 'biscuits'.  Very confused.  These are not biscuits.  Nor are they really rolls.  What the hell are they?  And why are they covered in cinnamon and sugar?  Just plain odd, and not the most tasty biscuits I've ever had.  You guys should just call it a day and go back with Biscuit Basics 101 - Flour+Buttermilk+Lard=BISCUIT.  If it's good enough for the South it's good enough for the rest of us.

Service got spotty after our entrees arrived.  Our waitress was far in between on service, had to ask multiple times for refills on drinks even as she passed right by us.  Seems she was catering to a larger table nearby.

Prices are kinda high for Lucille's, around high $20s for a rack of ribs with sides.  Luckily we had an Xmas present of $100 gift card, which we used all of.  EH.  OK."}
{"text":"Came here for 4th of July. Will have to come back for their pretty good happy hour M-F 3-6 pm and after 9 pm (cheap appetizers and drinks). 

Food: Their food is a 3.5 - 4 stars in my opinion. Baby back ribs were flavorful but dry (half way through the full rack, I was so thirsty!). Garlic mash potatoes were amazing. I think KFC coleslaw is better. Boyfriend got the corn bread al la carte for 0.99 (pretty good price). I felt the corn bread was a bit dry and it fell apart the moment you put your fork in. The best thing they had were the complimentary biscuits with apple butter (THOSE WERE SO GOOD AND SOFT WE ASKED FOR ANOTHER). 

Service: I docked a point with the service. It might not be fair since we did go during July 4th. I will have to come back and give them a second chance. Server was there when we were seated and ready to order and when we were ready for the check. He passed us many times to get other tables' orders but never really stopped to ask us if we needed anything. I waited forever to get a refill of my drink. 

Price: It's expensive for what you were getting in my opinion.

Overall: I like it but don't love it. I will go back for happy hour to give them another shot. They didn't impress me for how much I was paying. If you do go here, stop by Costco to get the gift cards to save some money."}
{"text":"Went here first day arriving at Vegas.  I'm not a big meat eater but I love BBQ chicken.  Wifey and I decided to check this out.  The place was very clean and decked out like something from the south.  The staff was nice.  The food was great!  It was huge portions.  I suggest you share a meal with your friend or family member.  Wife had the ribs and I had the BBQ chicken.  Both great and they have different BBQ sauces to try.  The garlic mash potatoes were so good! Yum.
Will definitely go back!

Oh Also, since your eating BBQ, your going to get your hands messy.  They give you wet, warm wash clothes for your hands and mouth.  Never had that before and its a great idea!  Gets all that sticky sauce off!"}
{"text":"Lucille's took a bad experience and made it right and not many restaurants are that dedicated to customer service. Thank you."}
{"text":"Pricy but good. Not a long wait and super cold beer!

There were three of us in the party with each getting a drink the bill was about $100. 00

So if you have the money, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I thought the prices were very high, considering how the food tasted.  The restaurant itself reminded me of Applebees because of the decor - It was an \"okay\" experience, but I would probably not go back."}
{"text":"I think I hyped myself up too much for the place, so a little disappointed in the end.  I started off with a Back Porch Strawberry Lemonade... good lemonade with some vodka, can't ask for a more refreshing alcoholic drink.  For the entree I ended up sticking with the Back Porch theme and ordered the Back Porch entree which included Ribs, Chicken & Tri Tip Platter and two sides... yeah I'm a fat-ass, I don't deny it.  Anyways, the tri tips were overcooked; the bbq chicken was very good, but needed more sauce and the ribs were perfect.  For the sides I got the mac & cheese and the sweet mashed potatoes, which our server said were their two best items.  The potatoes were a little too sweet and almost tasting like pie filling, the mac and cheese was basically flavorless, so was very disappointed by that.  Ah well, I tried it and it was ok, I'm sure I'd give it a second chance at some point... probably just get the ribs on their own.  Also, the biscuits with the apple butter... awesome."}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed they wouldn't honor their normal happy hour times because it was a holiday. The guy working there seemed pretty unsure and had to check. This happened before and one person over wrote it. So it appears as if the staff is not on the same page, which is frustrating. I called several other happy hr establishments on same said holiday and they all still had it, so I feel justified in thinking that's really bizarre and uncommon. I would also note that the restaurant was DEAD and we had 4 people who would have all gotten multiple drinks and multiple orders of appetizers each, probably spending more than a single entree costs. It would have been in their best interest to keep the paying customers."}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation which I highly recommend you do. They were super busy on a Friday night even though it was pouring outside. 
It was pretty loud there so not so great for conversation. 
The food was great and even for being busy the service was good. Our server was pretty on top of things."}
{"text":"Craving some bbq? Lucille's is a great option to try to satisfy those cravings. This location is located in the green valley district. On the left side of the district if you're turning in from green valley. Parking is easy and a short walk from the entrance. Green valley also has shopping available! What I love about this place is you can get all your classics here- brisket, burnt ends, chicken, ribs, etc, and the flavor is just so good! They also start you off with some bread w apple butter. Don't skip out on that. Prices are pretty reasonable, and the serving size is really good! Good place for groups."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday on 12/27 around 2pm. This is somewhat important because you know it's not busy at this time. Was told there would be a 15 to 20 minute wait, even though more than half of the restaurant was completely empty.  Our waitress, whose name starts with an M and ends with a shell, hehe, took our order and disappeared. The food came out and was delivered by the food runner, and our waitress just went missing. She did not come back to ask if we needed anything, she did not check on our drinks, NOTHING. 
The other waitresses didn't give a darn either, they were trying not to make eye contact as they knew we needed our bill, to go boxes, etc. 
I finally flag down our waitress and politely ask for the check, it takes her 10 minutes to drop it off and ANOTHER 10 minutes to ring us up. Goodness! I'm writing this because our service was just way too slow. I felt our server was friendlier and nicer to the other tables for whatever reason. I'm disappointed in the service. Not sure what it is with these chain restaurants. The staff just looked miserable, from the host to the bartenders. I won't be back. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. Come here if you like to wait and have 2 hours...at least."}
{"text":"I'm a southerner who knows his Texas and Tennessee barbq, so let's admit it: I'm picky when I experience it outside of the south. While the quality of the meat and taste was not quite up to those standards, most Americans will find Lucille's meats to be above average to excellent. For me, I found the jambalaya more impressive. It is served in an heaping portion, and the spices were just right to make it a memorable meal. Avoid the Texas beef brisket, which was not juicy or tasty like Texas brisket should be. Fortunately or unfortunately, the food I liked best here was fried, and there was a lot of it. If that's what you're looking for, this is not a bad taste of the South."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is definitely our new favorite date night spot! They're definitely providing comfort food with i could always use. I love this place it was our first time he order the chicken and two meat while i got the BBQ bacon burger with a few extras things on it! WE LOVE IT ALLLLLLL! Definitely will be back around the same time we went because it wasn't busy, food was accurate tasty and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"Great biscuits and apple butter.  Pulled pork queso dip was amazing, but we all know queso is always amazing no matter what.  I put three stars because the food seems overpriced and our avocados were rock solid.  Might go again but not any time soon."}
{"text":"For Thanksgiving this year my husband and I decided to take the easy route, and ordered the Thanksgiving family feast from Lucille's. While there were no complaints about the actual food, the overall experience left a lot to be desired. 

Disappointment #1: When I tried to order from the other Lucille's and I was told they were sold out. I don't reside on this side of town so I very rarely go to any of the businesses at Red Rock, but since I had no other option I placed my order with this location. I was asked if I wanted plates and silverware, and told my pickup time. 

Disappointment #2: Over the phone I was told I could utilize the parking spots reserved for customers picking up to go orders. When I arrived, these spots were taken. (When I left, they were still taken by the same vehicles, clearly not people there to pick up to go orders). These spots are pointless. I ended up parking quite a distance from Lucille's which wouldn't have been THAT terrible except...

Disappointment #3: After I paid for my feast, I was asked by an employee if I needed assistance, which in hindsight I think should have been obvious that I would need help carrying the very large and heavy box of food out to my car. However the employee was simply offering to open the door for me. The lack of basic customer assistance was a bit mind boggling, other Lucille's customers that were leaving as I struggled to maneuver the box out to my car even commented how they thought someone should have helped me. 

Disappointment #4: The plates and silverware I was asked if I needed? Nowhere to be found. Not a huge deal, but why offer it if you will not be following through?

After enjoying the food and company of friends on Thanksgiving, I considered posting this review but decided instead to write to Lucille's corporate directly. I received a phone call from a manager who apologized and said she hoped I'd give them another shot. While I do appreciate that time was taken to contact me, I do not forsee me spending more of my money at Lucille's anytime soon."}
{"text":"Oh Lucille's, how I adore you... you have never done me wrong. I have eaten there a handful of times, and while the ribs aren't my all time favorite, there are some excellent choices on the menu... 

Megan M. and I were trying to decide on a place near GVR to meet up with our husbands for some drinks, and since I have had such great experiences at Lucille's in the past I suggested we meet up there. Lucille's happy hour is from 3 to 7 Monday-Friday, and is available in the bar area only, but offers great deals on both drinks and food. 

I started out with the strawberry lemonade, which is alcoholic but sure didn't taste like it. Two of those went down very, very easily. My husband and I split two orders of the sliders, which were $3.99 for 2. You get your choice of bbq beef, pulled pork or buffalo chicken. The pulled pork was my pick, it was overflowing with lots of pork covered in tangy, tasty bbq sauce. I snagged a piece of the buffalo chicken from my husband and it tasted more like bbq then buffalo sauce to me, but he didn't complain about it.

The only negative aspect of our visit was the slowness of our server. My husband and I arrived after Megan and her husband had already sat down and ordered drinks, and it took a while for someone to notice we were there with nothing to sip on. As the night progressed the bar area got more and crowded (people just standing by the bar to take advantage of the drink prices) so if you want to sit down to enjoy your grub, arrive early!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the hair in our Burger was a bummer.  Overall the food compares to the Long Beach locations.  Inspect the TAKE OUT is my advice.  

Also,  in you enter through the Casino prepare to smoke a pack of smokes"}
{"text":"First timer at Lucilles. We were hesitant to visit because of the mixed reviews on Yelp but tried it anyways. Let me start by saying, there are entirely toooooooo many items on the menu....like over a dozen appetizers alone to pick from. It's better to have a smaller menu with items that are exceptionally prepared than an superfluous menu with items that are just okay....especially from a modest place like this.  

I selected the southern fried chicken because of another Yelpers recommendation and Im happy I did. Paying it forward and hoping someone else orders this too.  Very well seasoned, nice crispness and huge chicken breast (2 of them, actually). I realllly enjoyed my meal! My boyfriend order the beef tip trio and said it was \"okay\" . The baked beans were meh. I didn't like them at all, not sweet enough for me, but boyfriend did. 

Would I recommend this place? Not to someone looking for REAL southern bbq that is tender and mouthwatering. For that, go to Little Miss BBQ. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place--highly recommend it for several reasons: ambiance, food, and location. Oh yes...and service. They have the best Strawberry Lemonade in town and their Red Velvet Cake is divine. For appetizers you've got to try their BBQ Wings and our favorite dish is the Pulled Pork Sandwhich. The service is wonderful here because they don't just assign one waiter to you, anyone in a black Lucille's work tshirt will help you. We love their basket of sweet biscuits and butter they give each table before chow time. Being centered at the Tempe Marketplace, near shopping and Harkins Theatre, makes it a family favorite."}
{"text":"Can the world ever have too many bbq joints?  I think not.  Stumbled in here by default, when Yardhouse was at capacity.  This place had just opened, so my expectations were low, as it usually takes some time to work out the kinks in a new establishment.  Surprisingly, I really loved this place.  Yes, it is chain bbq.  But I don't hate on chains, as long as they are done right.  And this place is definitely done right.  

Everything our party of 8 ordered was great (with the exception of the fried pickles, but my Kentucky upbringing makes me a fried pickle connoisseur).  The roasted artichoke appetizer almost made up for the fried pickles.  I had the smokehouse slider trio as my entrée and have no complaints.  Great BBQ at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite East Valley restaurant. My friend, Mike, is the chef, and I'm proud to say everything was excellent. Burnt ends are one of my favorites and they were fantastic. And I was truly impressed with the ribs. I have not found anyone who makes babyback ribs as good as my wife. They had a great crust, were tender, and the flavor was excellent. We also ordered the full appetizer sampler to satisfy all the curveballs that the kids threw us. We left full and happy. Thanks, Mike!"}
{"text":"I love this place, great BBQ and good lunch specials. Meat is tender, sauce is sweet, and the iced tea comes in different fruit b flavors. If you love meat then this place is for you."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch. There was one woman in front of us speaking with one of two hosts when we arrived. The two of them couldn't quite figure out where to seat her in a restaurant laden with empty tables. They also didn't acknowledge us with even \"I'll be with you in a moment.\" After patiently waiting, we asked to be seated in the enclosed porch, which was fine. It took a while for our server to come, but she was cheerful & pleasant. Thought our lunch may be looking better, but no. Remaining service pretty slow (even with what they called the \"team approach\"), portions small for the price, food bland, barbecue sauces average at best, cornmeal crusted catfish and shrimp very heavy. Not impressed at all. There are many other barbecue choices in the Valley with excellent food, service and prices so we won't be wasting our time at Lucille's again."}
{"text":"Amazing tri tip sandwich. Shared the brisket nachos and we were surprised and impressed at the sheer size. Jerry is amazing and we love him."}
{"text":"Their biscuits & butter are AMAZING !!! & everyone who works here is soooo nice. & their backyard lemonade is delicious ! I love coming here. I always get the same thing , bbq wings & mashed potatoes & macaroni & cheese but it's the best by far & ALWAYS tastes so fresh. LOVE it here !"}
{"text":"It seems like every time we go. The ribs are always dry. Service is great. Burgers taste better than the ribs."}
{"text":"After about a 2 year hiatus, my love affair with Lucille's is back in full swing. It's one of those places that you go to like crazy and then forget about its existence for a while but once you return, you end up frequenting the join 4 times a month! That has happened to me and I am currently having an on-again romance with their tasty wood-smoked barbecue!

The menu here is extensive and expensive. The best money saving tip I have is to order stuff off the appetizer menu and share. My husband loves burnt ends so he usually orders the appetizer plate of them and I get a bbq chicken sandwich. We get some other appetizer or side to share and it works out great. Plenty of food and our check is under $40 (a bargain for Lucille's, a place where combo plates run about $25-$30 per person). Be aware of the high prices so you can avoid sticker shock. 

At least the expense is worth it! The food is fresh and tasty and the barbecued meats are fresh-smoked all day long (as made evident by the smoky smell as soon as you walk in the front door). There are several sauces on the table so mix it up and try them all! I love the cheese grits and Southern braised greens as sides; both are reasonably authentic enough to help make my raised-in-the-Carolinas belly happy. 

The complimentary biscuit basket is something I easily skip -- the biscuits are good but they are topped with sugar. I'm more of a traditional biscuit girl (but the sweet cinnamon butter on the side is delicious). But don't worry if you are watching your sugar intake: one of the best-kept secrets on the menu is their fruit-infused UNSWEETENED iced tea. You can get delicious brewed regular tea or their ZERO SUGAR fruit infused peach or watermelon iced tea! The peach is delicious. All come with free refills so drink up (always ask for a free to-go cup after your meal and you'll get a giant treat to take away)!

The atmosphere is cool and fun and there are different themed dining rooms. I love sitting on the (fully indoor) back porch. The bar has particularly cute decor so be sure to pop your head in to sneak a peek. 

Parking can be difficult on the weekend but if it's too crazy, just park next door in the Green Valley Ranch casino parking garage and walk over. Another negative is that the service can be hit or miss. I've had more misses than hits at this place, but I still love it."}
{"text":"Just love this place, best southern in town!!
Luv their fried chicken n fried bbq chicken sandwich my hubby just adore the beef ribs :)"}
{"text":"Hi there's nobody in line and we have 15 tables open but your gonna have to wait 20 minutes. First bad experience here. Left a bitter taste in my mouth about future visits."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of bar-b-que. Still not. Lucille's does a few things right and gets things wrong.

I like my sweet tea with the right amount of diabetes and they deliver. Love that sugar. The pre-meal biscuits was awesome. The honey butter they give to spread on the biscuit is magical. Their garlic mashed potatoes don't pack as much garlic flavor as I would like, but they were fine. Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw was great, definitely spiced up coleslaw for me. Fried pickles didn't do anything for me, however. Breading fell off way too quick. I ended up just eating a hot pickle. Meh.

Main dishes did not end up as well. The brisket was dry. Very very dry. Definitely needed plenty of BBBQ sauce (the extra B is for BYOBB) to soak into that brisket. It was a shame that it was so dry, I thought the flavor was okay too. Pulled pork was missing flavor. It just ended up more like wet meat than anything. Brisket burger also had dry brisket.  

It's a shame that brisket didn't end up being that great, since that's the one BBQ food I do actually enjoy a lot."}
{"text":"Being from the south and having roots to the Carolinas, Memphis and Texas, I'd like to think that I've had my share of good bbq. When Lucille's was suggested, I didn't get too excited but I was willing to give it a try. 

We arrived in a Friday arrived 5 for a party of 8. The hostess was great and suggested we look at the menu and let us know it would be about 15 minutes. Though it took almost 25 minutes to get seated, it ended up being worth it. We were seated right in between the kitchen entrance and the smoker which worried me at first. But it gave us the best seat on the house to see (and smell) all of the meat. Plus, we were constantly checked on by the flow of staff going by our table. 

Our drinks and appetizers were quickly served and everything looked great! I was overly excited about my sweet tea (which they perfected) and the sangria. There was an assortment of beers at the table that all got the thumbs up. And those sugary biscuits. Oh my!! I could have ate the biscuits and drank my sweet tea all night. I really hate to say that I didn't bother with the butter. I was temporarily in a sugar high and my vision was clouded. 

Once the food started coming out, we were ready to get our hands dirty. Since my southern twang was out in full force, I went for the southern fried chicken sandwich. Even the smell of the bbq could stop me. And that was the best choice. That had to be the best chicken sandwich I've had in a long time. The brisket from the table that I sampled only confirmed that I had made the right decision with the sandwich. And unfortunately even the greens were blah. And there was no salt on the table so they eventually got cold and weren't eaten. 

Our waitress was amazing. The food was overpriced but nothing to deep to keep me away."}
{"text":"We arrived at the restaurant at 4:30. We've been waiting over 45 minutes to sit down and the entire seating area is open to the casino windows is completely empty. I guess we caught them off guard for dinner!  We got here early to beat the rush. Hoping the service is better than our experience thus far!!"}
{"text":"Normally I avoid Tempe Marketplace at all costs, especially on a Saturday night, but a friend insisted on going because he said it was really good food in large portions.  Apparently not so anymore.  Four of us split the Lucille's Appetizer Platter which is basically a sampling of all of the appetizers.  This was good, but then again it's hard to go wrong with fried food.  It's the meat that they really screwed up on.  I ordered the tri tip sandwich, which I describe as slices of beef jerky on a dried out potato bun with a little BBQ sauce.  Funny thing is, beef jerky is exactly how a friend described his steak, which he ordered to be cooked medium and it came out well done.  The only meat that anyone ordered that was moist and tasty was the chicken.  The service wasn't the best.  We were promised biscuits but we had to remind one of the four different servers we had that they still hadn't come out more than halfway into our meal.  Maybe it was just a bad night for dry, overcooked meat, but given the location, prices and lack of stellar service, I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing bbq. Service is OUTstanding! I highly recommend the greens, St. Louis ribs and the Louisiana lemonade (I think that's the name??) 

I'll be back"}
{"text":"Been hearing about Lucilles for a while. Love barbeque. Me and a couple of friends stopped by Green Valley, someone referred us to Lucilles when we asked about food recommendations. It was soooo good. Service was great."}
{"text":"We've frequented Lucille's for the past 15 years or so.  We don't have one in our area, so when we are on vacation, we try to visit when we can.  I've been to their restaurants in California, Arizona and this last visit in Vegas.  The consistency and quality has always been the same.   

The fact that we've frequented here for over a decade speaks for itself."}
{"text":"The food was decent but for the price I would have expected a little bit more.  I whent there today for lunch and ordered the BBQ lunch special 3 meat combo 15.99 I got a single hot link, the sausage was good but a bit on the dry side spice and flavor were OK nothing spectacular.  Also got the baby back ribs 3 rib bones small in size but I thought the flavor was good, sweet and tangy sauce not over smoked meat was tender almost fall of the bone but still with a little bit of chew. The pulled pork was a bit of a disappointment for me it was less than a hand full on the plate but also lacked in flavor I smothered it in there BBQ sauce and it whent down well a bit on the tough side. my side order was a portion of Mac and cheese which I thought was very good pasta was done it was hot and cheese when it got to the table. I would have wanted those sweet teas to be a little sweeter I've visited the south a couple of times and these do not really come close. The staff as a whole was great more than one person came by trough the course of the meal to make sure we were OK, the waitress was nice and made sure we were not missing anything over all a decent restaurant maybe next time I will try the different foods but as far as BBQ I will continue the search."}
{"text":"Amazing food horrible service. The manager of this place needs to get some secret shoppers and improve the service. So many employees and not many say hello or they will be right with you. Stood at the to go line 5 minutes and no one asked if they could help or that someone would be right with me. Sad because the food is awesome ."}
{"text":"We come here almost every Tuesday. My boyfriend gets the burnt ends and I get the chicken sliders. Every week the food is amazing and delicious (obviously why we keep coming back)
The sugar on the biscuits is like heaven. 
We always get the server Amy who duals as manager which makes sense cause she's the best"}
{"text":"I love this location! My waitress was so nice and she even point out the lunch special to me. I had the jambalaya and it was tasty, not enough meat and it's more of a super thick broth but still good and it came with white rice. They have a big menu to select from so I'll definitely be back to try other stuff. I had their chicken dinner a while back and it was delicious. You won't regret eating here! Love it. 5 Stars for the service and good food!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group last Saturday night. Parking was pretty ridiculous since the District is apparently a very popular destination. We started our meal with biscuits and apple butter, which were pretty yummy, as well as a salad with croutons and choice of four dressing (ranch, bleu cheese, balsamic, italian). Then they brought out an assortment of all kinds of meat, including pork ribs, beef ribs, pulled pork, and chicken. We also had a nice variety of sides, including french fries, sweet potato fries, mashed potatoes (surprisingly awesome), collard greens (not bad), and veggies.

I enjoyed mostly everything and was pleasantly surprised at how moist the chicken was. The sweet potato fries were not that impressive, although the normal ones were. I honestly could have done without the loud music, which makes it hard for anyone inside the building to have a conversation, and I found that the Memphis-style BBQ sauce was too tangy and almost seemed to have a metallic flavor. However, I really loved the normal BBQ sauce (and I avoided the other one because I'm not that much of a fan of spicy).

Lucille's is not perfect, but it's a really nice place on this side of town to enjoy American BBQ."}
{"text":"Get your Red Rock BBQ here

Hankering for some BBQ close, a group of us tried this place in the Red Rock casino. Being seated quite quickly for lunch we were greeted by the server, she apologized straight away for the construction outside. Didn't even realize until she said anything.

So to start we grabbed the Peach lemonade, and id like to say that even though it was a non alcoholic drink it was pretty amazing.

Grabbing the Chicken and Pull Pork with a side of Sweet Potato Mash I dug in right away. Both the chicken and pork had a great smokey flavor to the them with the chicken nice and juicey. The surprise of the meal was the Sweet Potato mash!!! Highly recommend if your unsure of a side.

Overall
The service was good, the food wasn't bad and the business was clean.
I can't say it was the best BBQ dishes I've ever had, but I'd say it's on par with famous Dave's or alike"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Server DreAnna needs to learn better service skills. She is not attentive."}
{"text":"I like the idea of Lucille's more than I actually like it.

It's near where I work so I've been there several times for work lunches. Which is great when I want to sleep at my desk that afternoon. Like most BBQ joints, Lucille's gives you huge portions. Unfortunately, it's not good enough that i want a portion that big.

The other day the co-workers and I went there for lunch. I hadn't been in a while so I was looking forward to trying it again. We walked in and were told there would be a wait even though most of the tables were open. Weird. But the bar is open seating so we just grabbed a table there. 

We started with an order of sweet potato fries for the table. They were actually really good. I do like their sides a lot. So I enjoyed stuffing my face with some sweet potato goodness.

For my entree I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with watermelon. My sandwich was just luke warm and something about the sauce tasted funky. I've liked it in the past but there was something a little off  this time. Luckily I had filled up on fries so I just kinda picked at the chicken. 

Oh, the sugary biscuits you get with your meal are good too. So really, all the sides are good and the BBQ is just okay. Maybe they should have an option of a side sampler as your meal.

Overall, it's good not great. Good for a lunch where someone else is paying, that is."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted BBQ since it was Memorial Day weekend and stopped by Lucilles at Red Rock. We came on a good day I guess based on some of the reviews. We were seated very quickly. The food was great. My husband had the Beef Rib/Chicken combo and I had the Tri-Tip/Baby Back Ribs combo. Loved the biscuits with the cinnamon butter. The fried pickles as the appetizer were the highlight of my day. I have been to the one in Henderson and this one. Both times, my meals were superb. I will return."}
{"text":"A little pricey for my taste. Food is good. Nothing really stands out tho, besides their BBQ sauce. Great environment. Wouldn't recommend going during peak business hours because the place gets packed. Long wait times and poor service."}
{"text":"Delicious southern BBQ - you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Po' boys, tri tip, chick or ribs it's all delicious. Oh my gosh - and those biscuits & butter you get when you sit down are so. freaking. good. And they have a great cocktail menu too (I highly recommend anything with cucumber in it - so refreshing)."}
{"text":"I didn't know Lucille's existed at Red Rock, we were actually there to go to another restaurant and the smells MADE us walk in.  We were there on a Sunday but after the usual lunch rush and we were seated immediately.

The place is designed to look like a Memphis neighborhood and it's adorable.  You feel like you are in a private courtyard having a down home BBQ.  The staff is very friendly and abundant.  At times I felt that there was more staff than customers, but they are happy to be at work and it reflects.

We ordered Fried Okra http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QPkwidK5tNowIAqaXyhW5g&userid=ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA  and Fried Green Tomatoes http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=frsSYty3-wDSpFLo6poEfw&userid=ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA  as our starters.  They were both excellent but the sauces they served them with really made them stand out.  The BBQ Ranch sauce they make is fabulous.

For our main courses I ordered the Carolina Baked Potato with pulled pork, cheese, red onions and BBQ ranch sauced stuffed in it.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA  It was really tasty and I could not eat the whole thing.  It came with a side Caesar Salad.

Hubby ordered the St. Louis Ribs with Tri-Tip off of the lunch menu, it comes with a side and he chose the shoestring potatoes.  He loved his meal except the ribs are a dry rub not sauced and he found them very dry.  They do have several signature BBQ sauces on the table to use though.

We really enjoyed our meal but there was a very VERY long wait for our main courses, which made no sense to me because realistically this type of food has already been prepared hours earlier.  The staff apologized and would keep reassuring us that it was on the way, but they never gave us a reason for the long wait.  The appetizers came out immediately and I know those had to be prepared per order, so I am confused.

Definitely would go back for another visit, but we if they make us wait like that again, it will be a pass."}
{"text":"My favorite barbecue eatery in Arizona! Exceptional service, unique decor & very friendly staff. Prices are in line with Famous Dave's but Lucille's ribs are the finest around. Great service. 5 stars in all areas."}
{"text":"Watched 4 parties who arrived after us get their food. We ordered sandwiches. Absurd.
Informed that the order was never rang in though. We were sitting dead center with an empty table for an hour.
Kristen - it was 2 sandwiches and you passed us how many times as we sat there with no food?"}
{"text":"I have only been here once and need to go back. The BBQ is excellent and portions are huge!"}
{"text":"The menu is extensive but not overwhelming. They use applewood for the bbq and what flavor it adds. There is a bar and outside seating. The sweat tea with a mint leaf is the best I've ever had. If you love ribs, chicken, brisket,
tri tip and fried catfish this is your place. Great wait staff and management. Even when busy we get seated in less than 15 min. Their signature bbq sauces include mustard, hot and orginal (my favorate) which you can put on your tab or pick them up on your way out. If you buy four they give you a sturdy cloth carry all that holds all four. Great for large parties or couples. They have live jazz after 7pm.
Must try"}
{"text":"So. The food was worth more than two stars but man was the service horrible. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes for our food. It wasn't the servers fault, she was trying. The kitchen just responded that it's busy. Not coming back anyone soon"}
{"text":"Had a pretty good dinner, never have been here when I've been in Vegas before so my husband and I decided to try it.   Waitress was really nice and attentive.  Watermelon tea was new to my husband and he loved it!  The biscuits and apple butter were good, biscuits could of been a little warmer.  I ordered the two meat combo and so did my husband,  we both had baby back ribs and brisket, brisket was not as tender as I wanted it to be, ribs were delicious.   I had garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob, both were very good.   My husband had baked potato and bbq baked beans, both were very good and we would order the same sides again.   Overall the only thing that was weird was that there didn't seem to be crowded and we still waited to be seated.  I would hate to see what it would be like on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW: So, hubby and I went back to Lucille's. Oh. Em. Gee. This was a completely different dining experience than the previous one. And reminiscent to experiences of the past, prior to the visit that sparked the first review. But I digress...
We were seated immediately by a lovely young man a the host(ess) station. Our server, Claudia, was there at our table  mere moments after were seated, taking our drink order and offering us complimentary biscuits and apple butter (YUM!!). When Claudia returned with our drinks we were ready to order. As we were in the mood for a nosh, we stuck to the appetizer menu. We ordered the sliders, tritip bites, fried pickles and the hand/homemade BBQ chips. One word: DELISH!! Unlike the previous visit when the food was cold, ALL of our food was piping hot. Perfect. The beef was succulent, the sliders was seasoned well and portioned perfectly. Fried dill pickles are an acquired taste, very southern. I LOVED them. All in all this was a lovely visit. We will be returning, just not on a Saturday night. I think that that crew takes being busy for granted and as a reason to be lax on customer service. Claudia was DA BOMB!!! An excellent server who is attentive to her guests is an invaluable team member. She was just that. All in all everyone whom we came in contact during this visit was a delight. All of the food came out at the same time so that we could share. There was no waiting for anything.  Nice visit. Great food. Will be back. 


Let me start off by saying that I have been coming here with my family since Lucille's opened at The District. We would come
For birthdays, anniversaries, major school accomplishments were celebrated at Lucille's. Why? The food was excellent, the service was warm and friendly, end of story. So, what changed? I have no idea. But all I can say is that my visit on 2/21/2015 will be my last. While we were seated quickly, it took TEN MINUTES before someone even approached us to see if we had been taken care of, and might I add, while we were waiting the child at the table next to us kept making faces at us. Oy. When finally approached, we gave this person our ENTIRE order. At this point my husband and I had had enough of the child next to us with the oblivious parents, so my husband, quietly, approached a server and asked if we could be moved. After 5 minutes we were accommodated and seated in the bar area. Our former server personally handed us off to our new server. And then we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. At this point we are at the 25 minute mark from when we MOVED. No one came back to our table to check on us, to see if we wanted another cocktail. So I went and sought out a manager. After another 10 minutes the food came. Then a manager appeared. Needless to say she was useless. While we were clear that we were not asking for anything to be comped she didn't offer anything up except a half assed apology. Her listening skills leave much to be desired and stop defending poor service. And now the food...in a word: AWFUL. I ordered the tri-tip salad. The beef was like shoe leather. And cold. In edible. My husband got the jambalaya. A dish he has had here many times before. He barely touched it. The appetizers were mediocre. I had a half order of fried green tomatoes. They were soggy and the sauce was coagulated on the plate. Gross. And the kicker? It took less time to walk to our car and drive HOME than it did to get our food at our table. I'm a local, and you can bet I will be telling people not to come here. And if I could give zero stars I would. Below sub-par. Very disappointing. Very sad."}
{"text":"Lucille's is a mystery to me. It's a coin toss whether I will have a good or bad experience. I have gone and had wonderful service and warm tasty food, and I have gone and had nothing but bad news bears. Lucille's to me is not GREAT barbecue, it is ok, good for Arizona probably, but far from the greatness of most barbecue pits in Texas. I do like the restaurant itself, it is fun and inviting and the waiters each take care of all the guests, teamwork style, which USUALLY means great service, but again, the coin flip. 
      My recent trip with Kristen and my Mommy went well, we had a terrific server (can't remember his name!), our drinks remained filled and our food came out quickly. The food itself was, again, good, not great, nothing special. The best thing was the fried okra, the best I've had actually, the okra seemed very fresh and was so tasty. I had the southern fried chicken and it was fair, the chicken alone was a little bland, but nothing the peppery gravy couldn't cure, the skin also wouldn't stay on the chicken, which is simply a pet peeve of mine, no big deal. I had sweet potato fries and mac and cheese with it, which were both delicious and I would definitely recommend them as sides. Mom got the Texas style beef brisket and Kristen the pulled pork sandwich, which were both pretty good, but nothing I didn't feel like I couldn't get at any barbecue chain. We all chose the same sides and all enjoyed them very much. 
      If I'm in the area and want barbecue, I would come here again, but I certainly wouldn't travel for it, I would just pick the closest barbecue chain and be just as happy. So I'm not saying don't try Lucille's, I'm just saying flip your coin carefully."}
{"text":"I loved Lucille's. It was the best BBQ I've had in all of Vegas. We went on Valentines Day and thankfully we had a reservation, otherwise, it would have been hell getting a table. There were people all over the place waiting for a seat. The menu is a little pricey, but definitely worth it. You get a lot of food with great quality. I recommend the onion straws, sweet tea, baby back ribs, and the mac and cheese. Recently, they have added a Happy Hour menu that has great prices on apps and drinks."}
{"text":"Love the Lucille's in Henderson so we thought we would try the one at Red Rock because it was closer. Went on a sunday night and was seated promptly. The waitress took our orders but had to come back twice to see how I wanted my steak and what kind of potatoes I wanted. When the food came it was warm. Had the new york strip. Very taisty. They put a dollop of butter on the steak, but it isn't hot enough to melt it. We will go back and hopfully the wait staff is less forgettful."}
{"text":"Once again back out to Lucille's. And it gets better every time we go. Made reservations for 6. Got there about 5:45. Glad I hade reservations cuz the wait was about a hour and a half. We were seated within in 5 min of showing up. William was our waiter and he was fantastic. He was quick with the drinks and very attentive with our order. The food came out in about 20 min. And VERY GOOD. I live in the northwest and I will defiantly make the trip to Lucille's in Henderson."}
{"text":"Returned here for dinner since my hotel was nearby during the week. I was seated asap and my waiter took my drink order.

I went with the 10 oz tri tip, mac & cheese and sweet mash. The tri tip was amazing-super tender and the light BBQ sauce was heavenly tasting. As before, the mac & cheese was average but the sweet mash was definitely a hit.

BTW the red beans and rice dinner was discontinued but they still offer other southern Cajun entrees."}
{"text":"This place was amazing great atmosphere nice hostesses . It was pretty quick on a busy night and I like how they send you friendly text messages on your phone when your tables ready . They have indoor and outdoor its a nice theme it looks like there would be a swamp right next to it lol . But yes the food was great I got a 3 meat plate I dont remember the name but I was half a chicken with baby back ribs and some brisket oh my goodness the brisket was awsome especially with that hot bbq sauce yummy and you get 2 sides so I got garlic mash and mac and chesse it all tasted so good I will be returning I had a great experience oh and I cant wait to eat those biscuits they give before your meal man so good ."}
{"text":"Happy to find that the Blackened Shrimp Avocado Salad is back on the menu. I loved that salad & was sad to see it go. However, when I was served the salad I immediately noticed the difference between the salad years ago & the salad now. The shrimp was not hot off the grill & was cold to touch. The shrimp & Corn were both missing those char marks. The Manager agreed that even though the salad was brought back on the menu it is prepared a little differently than before & the Shrimp should be hot to touch not cold. She took the salad back so that it can be corrected. The Salad was brought back to me with well seasoned & hot shrimp. It was yummy, still somewhat different but yummy. Sweet Tea with lemon, complimentary rolls with honey butter & Fried Onions were all on point. The BF was not happy with his rib tips saying it was more like strips of meat cut off of ribs. Lots of places to sit & our waitress was very helpful & pleasant."}
{"text":"We had dinner here a few nights ago. This is a very homey place. Lots of families  and surprisingly we didn't have a long wait for a table. 

The menu has a lot of typical Southern dishes. We had fried green tomatoes for an appetizer. In addition, they bring a basket of warm biscuits with sweet butter. Yummy

I had Tri-tips with garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. It was a carb overload! My friend had the ribs. Tons of food. And we ordered the smaller portion of each. The food was good."}
{"text":"I ordered the 1/2 chicken, rib tips and burnt ends, with braised greens and baked potato. Guess I was hungry! The hubbin ordered the pulled chicken sliders with fries (at least it wasn't a burger), but it all started with a biscuit and some fabulous cinnamon butter. 

The service was good, the \"muddy water\" (aka:Arnold Palmer) was one of the best I've had in a long time. 

The burnt ends are the bomb and the chicken as well, I was not a fan of the rib tips. The greens had a ton of flavor and I've packed up 1/2 of my dinner because I'm ordering red velvet cake and coffee for dessert. 

I definitely will come back and recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"If you want the quick review it is this 

Good but Overpriced. 

Okay on an update of this review. I have no been there twice. The second time by invite of management, as I was sent a gift card and asked to review again. I love this type of proactive response to review. Unfortunately they fell a little short when sending the gift card out. They send $25.00 gift card. Anyone who has been here can tell you most meals, plus drink and dessert will run you at the minimum of 40 bucks. The 1st time I went my meal and add ons neared 50 and this time when all was said and done I had spent close to 40. So sending a 25 gift card out is almost comical. Since I am going to have to spend more of my own money to try the place again. I give it and A for effort and a C for execution. Now on the the food. 

This time I had the two meat plate. Tri-tip and beef ribs. 28.99. My biggest complaint with this place is that is it OVERPRICED. There is another place that I can get all you can eat BBQ in town for 27 bucks after tax, and it is better than this place. But back to the review of the food. The tri-tip was the best I have ever had. It is also the only I have ever had. I look forward to trying more tri-tip in the future. This was some good meat though. The beef ribs they were good. I have had much better else where but they were good. I still really liked the mac and cheese. This time I also tried the banana pudding. I liked it. It was the style I like. Loved the presentation in a mason jar. I will say the over mix was a little off. If it is the mix I am thinking of it had to much of a sour cream taste to it. So I feel the ratio was a bit off of sour cream to cool whip. 

Overall this place goes in the good but OVERPRICED category. I would go back but only on someone else's dime."}
{"text":"My visit to Lucille's BBQ was good enough that I would be willing to come back again but I feel there is some room for improvement. I will preface this review by saying that Lucille's was very busy last night which could account for some of the issues I perceived.

My family and I got to Lucille's after 7:00 PM. It was so crowded it was difficult to even get in the front door and to the counter to put us on the list. I gave them my cell number so we could be notified that ours was the next group to be seated. There is a screened in front porch with some bench seating which we took advantage of while waiting. It did take a while but I do not believe it took even the 25 minutes we were quoted. Maybe 15. We were then taken all the way to the back for dinner.

I already knew before arriving that I wanted a tri tip sandwich and a half order of fried green tomatoes. I got garlic mashed potatoes for my side. My step mom ordered a fried chicken sandwhich and my dad ordered a brisket sandwich and a dinner salad. 

While we waited for all of that we were brought a basket of biscuits and apple butter. It was all very sweet but good. Then came our sandwiches. No salad. No fried green tomatoes. I asked about them and they were brought a while later. My dad was going to turn down the salad since it should have come before the meal but he took and ate it anyway. As did I with the fried green tomatoes.

As far as taste, quality and freshness go, the potatoes were good. Lumpy fresh potatoes complete with skins. The tri tip in my sandwich had good flavor but was dry. It needed a healthy dowsing of BBQ sauce. Original I believe. The tomatoes were good. Fried perfectly crisp. A bit of a sour note from being green. It was the sauce I did not care for. I don't know what it is but it reminded me of Burger King's onion ring sauce. I could have done without a plate full of it. Maybe a side of ranch dressing instead.

I love the smells here. And the rustic theming of the various kitch filled dining rooms is cool. Service is friendly though maybe a bit spotty in certain aspects. Food was not disappointing but could have been better.  But again, it was good enough that I would gladly go back again.

UPDATE - Somebody from Lucille's has reached out to me about the issues I have addressed above. They wish to make things right. It is unecessary and, as mentioned above, I do intend to return at a later date. With a future experience to come, my hope is that the improvements I seek are made and I can update my review to a higher score. In the mean time, I should clarify that the server, I believe, removed my dad's salad from the bill as an apology for it being brought after the sandwiches. That along with the PM from the restaurant's management team go a long way in strengthening their customer service score. It is worthy of a half-star bump up to a 3.5 rating which I cannot make known in the actual star rating. Hopefully you are all reading this far to know so."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The brisket bacon cheeseburger is a must try! I love their sweet ice tea. Definitely a great place to have some good BBQ."}
{"text":"This is one of the best BBQ places in Az. The food is very tasty. I had the beef brisquit and mac n cheese. The waitress was super nice and helpful. I will come her again soon. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Exactly what you can expect from a Lucille's Restaurant. Amazing food with large portions! Also the staff here was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We ordered the $32 dinner special for two which was a really great bargain for what we got.

The apple butter was amazing on the biscuit. The brisket I chose wasn't the best but the fatty portions were sure tasty =)

For dessert we got the banana pudding which had a nilla wafer on top AND a hidden one underneath. MAKE SURE YOU FIND THE HIDDEN ONE!"}
{"text":"I was driving on 215 and saw that there was a Lucille's Smokehouse that just opened.  A friend had raved to me about the one in Green Valley.  I had never gotten to eat there because it is not that convenient to where I live.  I love BBQ so I called to see if Lucille's has patio seating and if I'd be able to bring a small dog.  The lady at Red Rock did not know so she transferred me to Lucille's where the guy that answered the phone gave me a very curt \"no patio\" and hung up before I could ask anything else!  He didn't even say \"bye\" he just hung up as I was speaking.  Seriously?  You are a new place that just opened and you've already been rude as crap to me and there are a ton of bbq spots in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Being from TX I have high expectations for BBQ. First time I went to Lucille's there was an issue with something I ordered (mac and cheese). The manager came and spoke with us and took my entire meal off of the ticket. We have found the good service continues throughout our visits. Good chicken, fish, ribs, tri tip, and sides. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Updating my previous review after being contacted by Lucille's management and offered a $25 gift card to come back and give Lucille's another try. 

My husband and I popped back into Lucille's this past Saturday after seeing an afternoon movie at Red Rock. The casino was quite busy with the Derby and the pending Mayweather/Pacquio fight. The restaurant was quite slow - I think it was probably 4 pm?

We were sat immediately in a two-top table, slightly awkward to get to because of it's location in a corner right behind another table that was seated. We were greeted within a few minutes by Nate who was friendly. 

I ordered a blackberry margarita and hubs ordered sweet tea. His sweet tea came first after Nate informed us that the original cocktail meant for me spilled and had to be remade. No problem. 

We ordered our meals - pulled pork sandwich for me, fried chicken special for hubs. We were offered biscuits while we waited which were hot and fresh. (Side note...these still aren't like any biscuits I've ever had and, being from the south, I would never think to dust the biscuits with sugar...but, ok). 

Food arrived - mine first with my husband's trailing after. Plates felt as if they had been sitting in the expeditor's window but ok..we got our food. My pulled pork was fine and as expected. Hubs' fried chicken special consisted of two fried chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, saw mill gravy on the side and an ear of corn.  Hubs wasn't thoroughly impressed with the chicken - after tasting a bite, it seemed to be lacking seasoning or flavor in the chicken and in the breading. Overall, it was fine and he finished most of his plate and was full. 

We enjoyed the meal as it was, and the service from Nate. Being the bbq connoisseurs we think we might be, Lucille's doesn't make the grade for us but other folks will probably enjoy it.  The food prices, in my humble opinion, don't match the quality or flavor. 

Giving Lucille's an upgrade to 3 stars because they cared enough to get us to come back and the return experience was better than the original."}
{"text":"Lucille's is one fine BBQ joint. You can't even get through the door and the smell of their massive smoker (located in the middle of the main dining room) will sneak up on you.

Coming inside, by how it is decorated, it feels like you are at a friends house. The servers are very attentive. They were table side instantly to get our drink order. They also helped us navigate the menu to find the option that would satisfy best. 

The portions were large. One of our people had a large plate of ribs, smoked in-house. I tried the burger. Both were flavorful. There are three options of sauces on the table that each added a special little zing to the meal. 

If you are craving BBQ, don't be afraid to swing down to Lucille's, they'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 Stars 

I had the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. Very tasty, though the pork had a bit more fat in it then I would like. the fries were tasty. 

The portions are beyond ridiculously huge. seriously. 

The biscuits they bring out are like little tufts plucked from heaven. 

The staff is nice enough, they work on a \"team work\" basis and tell you to feel free to grab any waiter, I find that a bit irritating. 

The prices are fair for dinner. 5 people = $101.93"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm impressed for a Cali based BBQ restaurant, it was some pretty good smokehouse BBQ! 
We went this evening hoping to find a good BBQ restaurant that was not Famous Daves & we found it, first of all I made a reservation via their online website & as soon as we checked in not even 5 mins later we were seated, the staff was very friendly and helpful, the server was awesome, food came very quickly and hot!  Their roasted sweet corn is pretty darn good & the apple cobbler well you'll just have to try it yourself to really experience the deliciousness that awaits :) 
I recommend this place if your looking for some good tasting food in a very southern style atmosphere."}
{"text":"A barbecue joint my girlfriend wants to go back to?!?  Can this possibly be true?!?  Apparently so!  She loved their sauce so much, she bought a bottle to go.  The sampler was superb.  Where else can you get barbecue, fried okra, fried green tomatoes, and fried pickles (pickles are not my thing, but I tried one anyway, ALMOST edible) on one platter?  The brisket was tender, moist, and delicious.  Cheese and jalapeño grits? Check.  Peanut slaw was uniquely tasty.  The only glitches were (1) a few minutes delay between delivery of meals one and two and meal three (both meals were brisket but with different sides, so ... I dunno) and (2) I am PRETTY sure one of our \"brisket\" meals was actually tri-tip, but it still tasted great and we shared, so it was no big deal. 

We will ABSOLUTELY be going back.  I can  go out to eat and have barbecue with my girlfriend!  YAY!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour: 3-7pm, excluding holidays.

Their HH is one of the best I've been to in the Valley with a menu that's extensive. Even if they're smaller portions than the regular plate, they've now become normal, human-sized portions -- enough for two people. Their food plates range from $2-8. Their drinks (cocktails and beer) range from $4-7. 

I had their gumbo, onion straws, fried pickles, rip tips, and Crocodile Cooler. The cocktail had five different kinds of rum in it and boy, does it ever. You don't taste the alcohol and it actually tastes very refreshing. I'd definitely recommend it for a good time. 

Their onion straws and fried pickles are typical fried fare. I can probably live off their gumbo and rip tips for the rest of my life. The gumbo came in a reasonable small bowl with a heaping of rice. The rip tips were enough for two people, about half a pound. 

I've come several times to their HH, left happy and satisfied each time. However, I just came on July 4th (craving me some BBQ) but they stated they didn't do HH on holidays, although the HH menus were out. I should have expected they may not do HH on major holidays but don't keep me in suspense, let me salivate, and try to order -- only to be told abruptly that you don't do HH on holidays. Take away the HH menus then! 


Overall, great space for HH, lots of seating (get there 3-5pm) and great service. (Most of the time)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I am a huge bbq fan, but gluten restrictions make it hard to find a suitable place to eat. Not only are all the sauces and meats here gluten free, but they're fantastic! The service was friendly and the atmosphere is incredibly chill/bluesy.  The portions are super filling (I got some three meat plate and shared it). Their sauces are also for sale for $5, and I bought one. It's just as delicious at home (: Definitely recommend to everyone. I'd come dress casual."}
{"text":"This is a very fun looking place. It's busy every time I pass by. Anyway...we went to Lucille's after my daughters graduation ceremony so we figured it would be busy with other families headed there. Boy, were we right.  We waited in the little room off the bar, with a beer, which was nice and relaxing. Table took about 35 minutes. 

After we were seated everything else took FOREVER.  I heard several severs apologizing for waiting. We ordered drinks and apps at the same time because we figured we wouldn't see our server for a while! Fried pickles and onion straws were good. Not great, but good. What seemed an eternity later our food came. Long story short: brisket-good, pulled pork- fatty, chicken-dry with good flavor. Mac and cheese- soso, sweet potato fries- average. Jambalaya-meh, baked potato- yummy, sugary biscuits-weird. Bill- I have no idea because my dad paid. Thanks dad!! 

Will I be back? Maybe, but will probably give some other BBQ a chance first."}
{"text":"We decided for our Christmas holiday dinner we wanted a place that serves a lot of food. Well Lucille's is that place. The atmosphere was fun and lively and the restaurant was pretty big. 

When it came time to order bbq it was!!! The food was good. We had the full slab of ribs, blackened catfish, cheese grits and collard greens. The cheese grits were delicious. The fish a little salty for me but everything else was good."}
{"text":"After writing my review of Lucille's one of the managers (Brad) got in touch with me and apologized for the experience I had. He offered to send me a gift card and hoped that I would give the restaurant a second chance. This shows a high level of customer service and guest recovery! Thanks Brad and I will definitely be returning to Lucille's in Red Rock!"}
{"text":"I am from Texas, so it is hard to find a BBQ joint out here in Arizona that impresses me, but Lucille's does. The biscuits and apple butter are a delicious way to start the meal. Every time I go I get the beef ribs and hot link. The hot link is the best and the beef ribs are huge and meaty! Their muddy waters (sweet tea and lemonade) and their strawberry lemonade is good and their desserts are good as well. Overall, this is a great restaurant!!! I can only give it 4 stars because everyone knows the best BBQ is found in Texas, but since I am in Arizona, this is an acceptable substitute!!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 15, large, but not extreme.  It took at least 15 minutes from the time our drink order was taken until we received our drinks.  Our food came out very slowly, one or two orders at a time.  So slowly in fact that the first person served was over half done with his dinner before the last two were served.  We had to ask twice for silverware for someone that was served early.  The brisket was great, the tri tip was alright.  The grits were good but could have used more salt.  The waitress was friendly, just slower than should have been."}
{"text":"Good was great, atmosphere was VERY loud...we had to wait over 15 mins for our rolls (which I really don't need to eat anyways) but over it was decent. Last time was better....."}
{"text":"Well I heard the food was good here so a couple friends and I decided to give it a shot. 

We had sat down and got situated. We started off by ordering some fried pickles and they were a lot better than expected. Can't say the same for the worthless biscuits that they only gave us 2 of. 

Well then after waiting a bit we got our food. But after a wave of servers went around trying to figure out what goes to what table. Is this their first shot at the restaurant business, is there no order to what food goes where. 

Upon getting our food, seemed our expectations were just too high. It was good but nothing spectacular. The food must have sat under a heat lamp for some time, our gravy was dried, my meat was dried out. 

All in all I would say go just a little further for a better place with better service at Famous Dave's. The service at Lucille's is just not on par. The servers are under trained and just can't handle the load."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good!  The waiter Reno was super nice and very attentive!  I thought the prices were a little high."}
{"text":"BBQ and Las Vegas. A very touchy subject. Adding franchise bbq joints to Las Vegas sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately, having all the pieces to operating a great restaurant includes customer service, presentation and maintenance. 
I had the displeasure of enjoying all  3 of these this last Friday for a colleague's going away lunch. The hostess was rude/stuck up, my forearm stuck to the table she seated us , and the server's service was less than sub-par forgetting 2 items we ordered because she did not write them down. 
This place only gets two stars because of its location and because the pitmaster actually knew what he was doing."}
{"text":"The servers are great and the food excellent. They were wonderful to our children Too! A great place for families."}
{"text":"Sitting inside Red Rock, me and my buddy decided to go check this place out. Upon going near the restaurant it seemed closed from the inside and outside view. When we peeked inside, the manager yelled over come in come in were're open, just running behind a bit. 

     So we entered and went to the bar, the place is big, but we didn't come at the busy peak time which to me was good. Our bartender who I literally forgot her name was awesome and down to earth. She frequently checked on us for drinks, biscuits, and some menu's. The biscuits were free and the food was awesome. 

     I had the fried chicken which was excellent, the only thing I will do next time is ask for no garlic lol, cause wow the next day my breath was kicking. My buddy had the spare rips and spicy hot link, he explained it was excellent as well. 

     Between the service and taste of food and menu choices I say 5 stars. I've been to places that were BBQ places and crummy service and food, but here is the total opposite."}
{"text":"Awesome place for dinner.  We were a large group that sat by the window in an enclosed outer part, if you know what I mean.  It wasn't totally outside, but it wasn't part of the regular indoor seating, either.  

Rustic charm with the comfort of a dependable chain.  Yummy food and very large portions.  The drinks are strong, and water comes in giant mason jars.  

Since I had already eaten at Lucille's in California twice that month before coming here, I decided to get some fish instead of my usual BBQ meat.  

I wanted to try the catfish but was told it would be spicy, so I went with the salmon instead.  You can get it smoked or grilled, and it's served with a generous portion of Creole rice and fresh vegetables and slathered with their New Orleans mustard cream sauce.  The food was really good and I was stuffed.  

I also tried Lucille's Spiced Rum Punch, which you can get a 16 oz carafe for two, and it's cheaper than ordering two individual drinks.  ;)  It was a pretty pink color and sweet and refreshing."}
{"text":"Absolutely poorest management. Service was horrible. Truly horrid. Lots of staff walking around.  Our waitress was totally inefficient.  Lots of wasted steps.  She was gone from her section for long periods.  Pork and bread were dry.  Not as good as the Lucilles at the District.  And also they need busboys/girls. Overstaffed but inefficient.  Bartender is also waiting tables plus serving at the bar plus performing bartender duties.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Our original plan after a trip to Michael's for crafting supplies was to go to Ruby Tuesday's or Dave & Buster's. We drove by Lucille's and said \"hey, why not!\" My son lives in San Diego and when I visited we went to another bbq place I really enjoyed. I don't normally go to bbq specific restaraunts.. but apparently I should! 

The food here was really good and the service was excellent. Some of the stuff was a bit on the sweet side for my friends but the ribs are definitely fantastic and tasty! The meat falls right off the bone.. so juicy.  Next time I go I'm getting the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portabello Sandwich - server tells me it's fantastic! Enjoyable meal, nice atmosphere and great service.. We'll be back."}
{"text":"So after my last review... The manger for in contact with me and apologized for the experience that I had previously... This speaks wonders for the customer service this restaurant has.. Great job guys! Not only did they apologize, but the sent me a gift card for 75$ so that we can replace the bad experience with a great one! My boyfriend and I did just that tonight! We had a great time! Our server,Lu, was amazing and the food was great! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Ribs were fall off the bone good and the garlic mashed potatoes were amazing"}
{"text":"Okay, so the hubby and I know a thing or two about bbq and we typically only visit large chain restaurants if it's convenient or if we have a gift card; both were the case on this visit and we hadn't been to a Lucille's in quite some time.  I must say, we were pretty impressed.  We decided to share one of their meat samplers so that we could try a few different meats.  The tri tip and the chicken were absolutely delicious!  The sides were pretty good as well.  No complaints on our end except for possibly the ribs...not our favorite.  Our daughter ordered a burger and she enjoyed that as well.  Oh, and I can't go without mentioning the biscuits and apple butter that you are given on arrival.  So good!  The staff was pretty friendly and attentive.  And I love the decor and how you can check out their smoker, which is set up in the middle of the restaurant.  Overall a great experience and pretty close to five stars.  Would love to return and see if I get that five star experience on a future visit."}
{"text":"I dont know what everyone is eating here that is so great?????? 
Another horrible meal here. Your tri tip is chewey an so thin it tastes like deli lunch meat. Total crap. Second try here. It was no good  the first time either.  Your meat quality is so poor  fatty chewey an tough. Your overpriced also. Memphis bbq blows you away for half the price you get the same amount of food an much better cuts of meat. Huge dissapointment. I can make better smoked bbq in my backyard. Never ever coming to your restaurant again."}
{"text":"I love this place.Great food,great drinks,and great service!! The apple butter is unforgettable. They have live music on saturdays and great ambiance."}
{"text":"I ordered a meal and what I got was a feast! Yes you will spend over $40 per person here but it is oh so worth it. Just don't fill up on the delicious biscuits they put out as a starter!"}
{"text":"I have had much better BBQ, with much better service, for way less money than at Lucille's.

I was excited to try the place because my parents had really talked it up, but maybe I just went in with too high of expectations. The hostess had misplaced a few brain cells and asked our party about 5-6 times what our name was, even though they had one of our numbers to call when the table was ready. Our water was ok, but super slow when it came to the checks and actually checking in on us. I liked the biscuits, but they were not amazing, a nice touch after waiting for so long to get a table though. No one in my party was amazed by their meals but one of the most disappointing was the mac and cheese. It sounded so good, but came out dry and mushy- gross enough to turn you off of mac and cheese for a couple of weeks.

So-so food, extremely loud restaurant- it will take a while before I consider to give it a second shot."}
{"text":"The 10 Oz Trip Tip dinner was big enough to split between the 2 of us.  Katie was an excellent waitress!  Great atmosphere and terrific BBQ.  Hidden in The District.  It will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell, not as good as Famous Dave's but better than Memphis Bbq (I'm only talking about BBQ chains). 

I had a gift card so we came here for lunch on saturday. Very crowded. We were seated in the back near a large party celebrating a graduation. And shortly after we were seated, another party sat down; one of the ladies was super loud (it never fails, we always end up next to a loudmouth who announces her business or who sounds like she's with someone who is hard of hearing. I had to tune her out towards the end). Service was very good. It's like we had an army of servers. Our main one was sweating, he was busy.

The sugar topped biscuits and apple butter was my favorite menu item. Deliciousness. Almost like a crisp firm outside and inside it was soft but not doughy. Finished off with apple butter, which melted, mmm. 

Big Menu. From the lunch menu, we each had an individual platter, 3 meats, ribs, brisket & chicken, with 1 side item. Hubby chose the garlic mashed while I opted for the potato salad. The meat portions were quite small, the sides more generous. The salad was good, but there was something missing. Maybe it was a bit mild. The bbq flavoring was good (but Famous Dave's is better). The brisket was lean, the chicken was better if you got the breast (hubby did, but he offered the rest of his breast to me, aww). On the ribs, I kept getting some tiny bones (I wasn't eating the bones, I was getting grossed out, sorry, had to use a napkin to discreetly dispose of it). The sauces on the table, only 3- a sweet one, a spicy one, & I forget the last one (FD's has a lot more). I liked the spicy one. Oh, and the peach tea was refreshing. Drinks are in mason jars (like memphis).

Large place, smoker is in the middle of the main dining area, & there is seating outside in the front. Clean restaurant. Nice ambiance compared to the other bbq chains that I mentioned. Cloth napkins. Warm damp washcloths are given after your meal is done. Nice. Servers wear an all-black uniform. Staff is very nice; greetings on the way out.

We did bring a to-go box for the little one. Also had a remaining balance on the gift card (so we are coming back, but ordering other things). And since I signed up for the e-club (ahead of time), I got a $5 off coupon which we used too."}
{"text":"This place was so good when we first went there. Of course this was back when the economy was good for all.... now I must admit we are more careful with our money. We eat out less and we are picker than we used to be.... BUT I think these guys are taking short-cuts too. I used to LOVE the fried chicken meal. OMG you get two HUGE pieces of chicken on top of mashed potatoes. I would end up with left overs or my stomach hurt. We went there for my birthday. The chicken was burnt on the edges. The potatoes were slightly warm at best. I ordered one of those fancy drinks. I am not much of a drinker anymore, so usually one is enough to make me buzz. This thing was 7 bucks and had so very little alcohol in it. It tasted good, but darn I should of just got the sweet tea! At least it doesn't pretend to be alcohol. I really feel this place has gone down hill. They are pretty pricey. I don't have a problem paying if I think I got good food. I USED to here. We rather go to Honey Bears now. They are good for half the price!.........UPDATE....... Ownership did contact me and offer me a gift card so I would try again. I will post when I do. I was impressed with them caring."}
{"text":"Every time I've been here I'm always welcomed by a friendly greeting and the smell of delicious BBQ! I do enjoy Lucille's, it's not the best BBQ joint I've eaten at here in Vegas (hence the 3 stars), but it's tasty enough for me to come back. 

The items I've tried from here that I really enjoyed were there mac n' cheese, biscuits, and cornbread! Talk about carb lovin'!! Although this may not be some of their speciality items there's something about them that is special and uber tasty.  Oh yea, and their fried pickles are a must!! 

A few items I've tried that fell flat were the grilled chicken (on a salad) and the rib tips. The chicken tasted more like flavorless broiled chicken. If the salad wasn't already so heavily dressed I would have added one of their various homemade bbq sauces to spice it up. Their tips were one item I was really looking forward to, but they ended up being super fatty and chewy (if you're looking for a really great tip place see my other reviews). 

I do appreciate the ambience. It is lively and casual and great for families. I also appreciate their 7 day a week Happy Hour from 3p-7p and again from 9p-close. Who doesn't want to \"get happy\" every day?! If you have yet to try this place I say give it a go...it's worth a try!"}
{"text":"My first visit here. I had high expectations because everyone always gets worked into a frenzy over their biscuits. 

Came here with a big group and one friend picked this place, even though a couple people in our group are vegetarians. I take it that vegetarians don't come here that often as the wait staff had a lot of trouble comprehending what they wanted when they were asking for salads without meat. My dining mates finally just said screw it, bring the salads out with the meat and we will pick it off. 

I ordered a Memphis sandwich with sweet potato fries which was okay got soggy way too fast. It just became a potato bun mash and fries were not that crispy. However, it did sit there for a while because all of our food came out at very different times. I was raised that you do not start eating until everyone has their food. I sat for several minutes before everyone had their food, which could have been a contributing factor. 

I did like the variety of the 3 BBQ sauces on the table. They were filled to the top and clean. I feel like a lot of places can be sloppy with their condiment bottles and our table was a great example of how it should be. The biscuits were also something to work yourself into a frenzy for."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ here! Wow! 
Loved the Baby Back Ribs and the BBQ chicken here.
Garlic mashed potato and greens were yummy!
Don't forget the sweet tea!!!
We will come back when in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"I am not big on BBQ... But Lucille's is probably only one of the only BBQ places that I've actually liked! 

The restaurant from outside, in is decorated as if you've been invited over to Lucille's backyard BBQ. Very cute! 

Our server was Ashley and she was a doll! Checked up on us frequently and was great with refills! 

There were 5 of us and our server suggested to get 2 of the BBQ specials for 2... There was so much food that I can't even remember what was in it, and we even had to take most of it home. It came with an appetizer, sides, the Que and dessert. Out of their 3 BBQ sauces, I liked the tangy one,... Wish I could remember what the name of it was but I was suffering from food coma. 

Return visits? Probably only when the family is in town for a visit, it's on the other side of town."}
{"text":"So, I (capital letters) HATE Barbecue. Ok, maybe not hate, but if I had a choice, BBQ and eating nothing I'd choose nothing ... Except for Lucille's!

I'm not a fan of smoked (anything) but they put just the right amount of smoke in the Q that I don't feel like I myself am inhaling the smoke directly from the smoker. Their Memphis BBQ sauce is what makes it for me. I hearts me some garlic and that sauce has the right amount of everything!

Another one of the \"hooray\" moments I had was when they told us that they had unsweetened flavored teas, WHAT?! I dislike sweet tea, a lot. If I want a pound of sugar in my water, I'll ask for syrup. And most places have flavored tea but it's always sweetened and me no likey. They have watermelon, peach, regular and sweet tea. 

They have a nice backyard BBQ theme and have a stage in the \"Flying Pig Lounge\" which leads me to believe that they intend to use it one day for a live band. It'd be pretty cool to come in for a live band or even a comedy show :)

After the failed restaurants in this space, I hope this one sticks around!"}
{"text":"This was a little spontaneous eat for us. We were just walking around in the shopping plaza and I didn't really feel like eating at the surrounding restaurants. I saw this and decided to try it out. When you walk in, it takes you back to the 1960's. It has old school booths and décor. The waiters are very friendly and knowledgeable about what's on the menu.

WHAT I ORDERED: A peach lemonade that was so sugary I had to send it back and I never do that. For the appetizer we got the green tomatoes and the fried okra. Green tomatoes weren't that great and tasted more like fair food because the batter was so thick. Fried okra was good. The sauces that it came with weren't that great. I actually was dipping the okra in the sauce that came with the tomatoes.

For dinner I got the tomatoes bisque which was horrible. It was very starchy and didn't even taste like tomatoes! :/

Overall the food was not impressive , border line cafeteria food. 

The environment was amazing and that's the only reason why I'm giving it a 3 star rating."}
{"text":"Service was quick, workers were courteous, food was awesome... Loved the fried pickles...  We had the meal for 10 and it was a lot...  the mac and cheese was very creamy and tasty..."}
{"text":"I realize this should be obvious, but I urge anyone who wants a healthy meal to avoid this place like the plague.  My mint julep was all ice and very little drink. We went for happy hour and I got the fried green tomatoes and the spinach artichoke dip. There were two slices of tomatoes on my dish so you really do get what you pay for.  There was not a salad that was not drenched in fat, bacon, eggs, cheese etc.  That being said, I realize this is a barbecue joint so if you're in the mood for barbecue they have tons of it! I had a team of barbecue lovers with me, and they were very pleased with the tri-tips and said they were amazing. Happy hour prices are really good. But if you are a veggie lover, in a group of meat lovers, just be aware that you will have a hard time finding something decent to eat."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place since the past summer but I stopped in for lunch and got a 2 meat plate of bitter tasting fat. The ribs were tasteless except for what I can only describe as charcoal starter fluid and the burnt ends were just hunks of fat drizzled with starter fluid and bbq sauce. I used to get consistently good bbq here so I'm really disappointed. I hope they can fix things."}
{"text":"I can walk into Lucille's and know that my food is ALWAYS going to be so yummy and satisfying.

But how long will it take for me to get that food is always the question.  

They'll start you off with warm biscuits that come with cinnamon butter, you'll want another free basket because they're that good! I've tried the burgers, ribs, wings and many appetizers and I've never once been unhappy with my food! It's always so good!! The fired pickles are my favorite! They give you sauce options on the table, you can mix and match to your liking. 
The staff is all very nice, just a hit or miss of how fast they will be to refill your water no matter how slow or busy it is in there.

Try the fried pickles!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst BBQ place to spend your money at. Dry pork. Food wasn't even hot when they brought it out just luke warm. Dave your money and go to Joe's BBQ."}
{"text":"I am on a mission to find the best Whiskey drinks in Vegas. I would not necessarily think that Lucille's would have a big bar selection, but they have a delicious Rye berry Smash here that I posted a picture of here on yelp. Also, their fried pickles are just YUM! Anytime I am craving bbq I think of Lucille's first. Now when I am thinking of Whiskey I will also think of Lucille's."}
{"text":"I finally found good BBQ in Vegas!
After being EXTREMELY disappointed by rolling smoke I stumbled upon Lucille's after a friend catered their event with Lucille's BBQ. 

Their baby back ribs are very tender and clearly the hit dish. 

I decided to visit the restaurant.
1. I love the location
2. I love the ambiance of the restaurant 
3. Alfonso my service was great at serving and very friendly

I had a great experience at the restaurant and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been to the one in Hendo and this one is def worse than the oh so perfect Hendo location!

We went here on a Saturday evening and were seated quickly. I asked if happy hour was still on and the man said no, then the sweet lady said it was and that we would be able to take advantage of it in the bar area AND still have Santiago, SCORE!

We were sat next to the water in front of Red Rock, so it was super nice! As the night went on it got a bit chilly, but we were ok.

Im going to keep this short, out waiter was an idiot and didnt listen to us whilst taking our order and messed up half of it. We then politley asked for it to be corrected and he AGAIN didnt pay attention so we ended up having an incorrect order. THEN we askd a waitress for a set of tableware and she looked at us as though we were asking for a million dollars, then only reason we asked was because they didnt give us enough!!

The food was cold and flavorless and we were basically ignored 90% of the night due to a large party in the bar area. The supervisors and most of the waitstaff were kissing this groups behind and it was getting pathetic.

There we sat waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Cold food and all!

We asked to speak to the manager and our server gave us a dirty look and asked why? WHAT!? Why? Because I said so! Jesus! The manager was not helpful and said it was because they were still new and hadnt been opened a long time. BULLSHIT! Your servers and staff are just a bunch of arrogant morons. 

The end!"}
{"text":"Awesome tri tips. The meat was tender and moist. Sauce was great.  had the 10oz portion and 2 sides.  it was more than enough food.  i didn't have room for dessert.  they had a live band playing so it livened up the evening."}
{"text":"15 dollars for a brisket sandwhich... i hate to be negative but it was super dry even with the sauce i put on... so was the pulled pork. I literally had to drink water with every bite. the flavor was good but u have to chug water to get the cardboard like texture down your throat. Its just basically tasted like it was sitting in a bin all day and put on a roll. 

2 stars because the sweet potato fries were amazing.

I dont think i would have been so disappointed if it didnt cost so much but when ur paying 15 dollars for roughly 5 ounces of DRY brisket its annoying really, you feel ripped off and feel like they just dont care about the quality of the food that theyre putting out.

I love good food and dont mind paying for it. But this was not good food.

Ill never come back here unfortunately... if you are rich and dont mind paying high prices for low tier food this place is for u. If not stick to a 5 dollar footlongs.

Management needs to do some quality control with their meats.. tastes like it was days old. Please fix this"}
{"text":"Wow, surprised to see all the lousy reviews of Lucille's here. I lived in SoCal for many years and was always a fan of the place, so I was rather stoked when I heard they were opening one here. Now, granted, it's not authentic in a Kansas City or Memphis kinda way, but I have to differ with the poster who opined that Famous Dave's is better....I'm sorry, but ol' Dave can't touch their ribs. 

Sure, there are some clunkers on the menu, but I've probably eaten at one Lucille's or another more than a dozen times and I've rarely left unhappy. The up-side to being absolutely bombarded with food is that there's bound to be something good on the plate. 

It's true, if you order the platters you will receive a plate the size of a small child, and weighing almost as much....makes you feel sorry for the waiters, who must get some serious bicep action. Yes, the short ribs suck, but the St Louis style are truly yummy. Burnt fries...? My daughter orders them every time and I've never seen it. The beans? Awesome. Don't know about the strawberry lemonade, but I go for the regular, and it's sweet but quite good. Pricey? Absolutely....not an every-week kind of place.

If I was a lightweight city kid or someone from suburbia, I'd have read the other reviews and thought \"gee, am I that clueless about BBQ?\" But no, I've lived in the south, I've traveled the US and much of the world...I do know good food. So while I don't want to bicker with my fellow Yelpsters (love y'all), I must agree to disagree with you on this one....Lucille's rawks. And BTW....if you plan on wandering around the Marketplace, eat dinner last, and take home the leftovers. (And for the record, I don't know anyone who's ever had room for dessert....)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Henderson, or actually I think my favorite so far ! My husband found his favorite beer in the world( red ale American amber) just wow! Great prices for the quality and the big plates! Love the bar area, the ambiance is so so beautifully made !"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of Lucilles being just another fake bbq joint and it took me over 2 years to get around to going. Wow! So surprised by how delicious it was! Cheesy grits were so good! Best biscuits, great bbq sauce selections (my favorite was the hottest!) We had the beef brisket and southern fried chicken sandwich. It was enough food for 3 adults, a baby and leftovers for lunch the next day. It is quite possibly the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. The only thing i wouldn't suggest was the fries. Shoestring fries don't do it for me. Service was friendly and the ambience was charming. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So we came back again after the first visit about a month ago. wasn't as great but the manager contacted me after my review on yelp n Rebekah accommodated me with a gift card to try it out again. This time was certainly a lil more pleasant our server (McKenzi) was very on point biscuits were the first to be offered at our table other than the drinks. The timeliness of the food was very fast not like last time, our drinks were always filled. Great job to the back kitchen for the great food n timely delivery. Great job McKenzi for your great manners n speed of service. Outstanding visit the 2nd time. Thank you i would come back!!"}
{"text":"VERY GREAT BBQ. Nothing beats our favorite place back in St Louis but this is the best so far in Las Vegas. We go here all the time with great service and great food"}
{"text":"4.5*
We've been to this Lucille's location several times. This was probably our best visit yet. Most times I would rate it a 3 1/2 or a 4 *s, but today we had excellent service and excellent food. The burnt end appetizer was good, but nothing over-the-top, and the biscuits were good but again not exceptional. However, my husband got the brisket burger with fries and it was amazing and I got the Cajun shrimp avocado salad and it was awesome as well. I know, who gets salad at a BBQ place - it was a 1st for me, but I would definitely recommend it, especially if you filled up on your appetizer and biscuits w/ butter like I did. I still prefer famous Dave's, but we will be back for more."}
{"text":"We've been to Lucille's twice in two years and the results have been pretty much the same each time. Ribs and chicken have been overcooked and the portions can't be rated as generous in any sense of the word.  Beverages, on the other hand, are generously but roughly prepared. A martini, for example, takes some crafting to prepare properly. Mine was mixed by someone doing a boot-scootin' line dance. The ambiance of Lucille's is wonderful if gawd-awful blaring country music is your preference."}
{"text":"Great food!  The biscuits covered in sugar & the cinnamon butter is delightful!  Big mason jars for their drinks and massive portions. Their meats are super good. The steak is soft as butter with great flavor. It's an all around great BBQ place."}
{"text":"Let's start with the bad part first.  The baked beans are NOT southern style.  When the waitress says she is going to bring \"apple butter\" she is lying.

I'm from the south apple butter to me is not butter with apple in it, which is what they give you.  Don't get me wrong!  It's really tasty, but not what I was expecting when she told me apple butter and biscuits.  The beans were gross but the pulled pork sandwich was actually really yummy!  The sweet potato fries were spot on as well.  The sauces were good too.

Overall it was a tasty place.  Being from Tennessee I was expecting food from home and despite the miss wording it was mostly perfect.  There is no helping the beans though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for lunch on a Friday. Both times I left happy. I would come back again if asked. 

First off I love the atmosphere in this place. Such a cute, southern, home-like, relaxing feel. Mismatched lamps FTW!! There's plenty of room on the inside and various different areas to sit in, which makes it interesting each time you visit. 

I've never had slow or bad service here. The server my first time there not only was speedy and attentive but as I finished their version of an arnold palmer I was asked if I wanted to try a variation of it next. It was incredible. The food was also amazingly delicious. Their fried pickles are pretty authentic in my opinion. Our waitress this time was just as fantastic. She had a conversation with us, she was extremely knowledgeable and put up with our crazy table. 

The barbeque always good. I have had better luck with the garlic mashed potatoes than the mashed sweet potatoes. As far as drinks the Muddy Waters (non-alcoholic) is fantastic as is a drink I had today that actually involved a sweet tea vodka. Unbelievable.

The only downside to Lucille's is that since it's mainly barbeque it has a limited menu."}
{"text":"Overpriced, save some money and go to Famous Dave's more bang for your buck and the food tastes the same if not better."}
{"text":"The most amazing tri tip and baby back ribs. The chicken is pretty dang good too (fall off the bone).  This is the first Lucilles I ever ate at, and is 100% better then the one in Tempe (sadly) 

Every time I go to Vegas, I make sure and drive out to Green Valley to hit this place up.

They did not let me down this trip either.  The service was better then ever, and they went above and beyond to make us happy!  I can't wait to go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this one a 4 because I first ate at (and found out about) Lucilles at the Vegas location.  Over there it was spectacular - here its just amazing.  They give you so much food its unreal.  You can try anything BBQ you want or ever dreamed of.  You get these amazing biscuits with this butter stuff that is just like candy before the meal, and almost get full just with these.

SO MUCH FOOD, go hungry and get ready to be amazed.  Some of the better BBQ in the area.  I look forward anytime I have the opportunity to visit a Lucilles.  Just can't wait till I go visit the Vegas one again!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the fam, our server Colton was awesome, friendly, & attentive! Food definitely hit the spot. Come during happy hour 3p-7p for cheap & strong drinks! The only thing that sucked was not being able to order happy hour drinks in the dining room, but no biggie. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"-My shrimp po-boy needed more \"food lube.\" There was just a tiiiiny bit of remoulade swiped on the bread. Also, I'd prefer more of a 1:1 bread-to-filling ratio on my po-boy. This was more like 4:1 (all bread). Moral of the story, I think I should order bbq next time if I'm at a bbq place.

-The bbq sauces are good, very molasses-based (except the Memphis-style one), and delicious. Kyle's pulled pork sandwich was delectable. 

-Nice sides. Authentic braised greens, delicious corn on the cob, watermelon slices, shoestring french fries, mac n cheese, cheesy grits-- all looked great. 

The prices kind of stopped me in my tracks, to be honest. I kind of saw the place as more of a Red-Robin type stop, but most dishes here are at least $15, even sandwiches."}
{"text":"When my family didn't bbq this 4th of July when I was really CRAVING it, this place delivered. I wasn't expecting a mind blowing meal, so maybe that's why it was sooo delicious! The potato salad was almost identical to my mother's. Had the perfect balance of celery, potato, onion. I'm a hugeee potato salad lover, & this totally did it for me. The mac & cheese as well was wow! Baked to cheesy perfected goodness just like I'm used to. Rib tips were a little fatty, which is the norm, but had plenty of meat on them & flavorful with the bbq sauce.& don't get me started on the apple butter biscuits!! Seriously couldn't stop eating, almost left my hubby with crumbs & gristle! Lol. WELL DONE Lucilles"}
{"text":"We have always had great food and service here! Would definitely recommend coming hungry, because you will leave stuffed! Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but you won't be disappointed!! It's great for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Hard to believe a Bar-B-Que joint could serve what would be the worst ribs I've ever had. I've had better ribs at restaurants that don't specialize in Bar-B-Que. They were pretty bad, so fatty that I didn't want to eat them, but so expensive I felt I had to. I guess I shouldn't have because they actually made me nauseous. I won't be fooled again by this place. Sorry if this review sounds harsh, but it's the honest truth."}
{"text":"This place has lovely decor and ambience, but they are VERY expensive for a BBQ joint. 

 I came in just before the dinner rush and was seated in the bar area, which I always hate. 

I had a desire for ribs, but those START at $31, so I ordered the tri tip dinner, which was also a bit pricy. Ordered a soft drink to go with it. The drink was large, thankfully. The server was loud, obnoxious and acted like I was really bothering her and holding her up when asked what was on the wedge salad. Acted like I should KNOW this when it can vary greatly from restaurant to restaurant. This attitude is inexcusable; it wasn't an unreasonable question and I have food allergies.

The dinner was just OK and the meat was on the dry side in some spots. I've had better BBQ at Dickey's for far less money and a LOT less attitude.

Next time I'm in the mood for ribs, I'll go to Rustler's Roost and Dickey's when I want good ole BBQ brisket."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is on good, a little expensive but worth it.  I like the location and the environment. The house beers are pretty good and the portions are huge.  By far my favorite place for BBQ in Vegas"}
{"text":"I had the BEST BBQ Beef ribs I have EVER had in my life.  Staff was friendly, service was very good.  I'll be back real soon for those fabulous beef ribs"}
{"text":"We love this place been to both locations Red Rock and by Green Valley Ranch Casino.  We always get the trio sausages for appetizers and sweet dinner rolls.  I rather eat here than Famous Dave's. I would say it the Best BBQ in town. And make sure to make reservations online they actually let you know when your table is ready."}
{"text":"1 of the top 3 bbq rib spots I always recommend to friends. Their biscuits are so delicious and warm. Portions are so huge that you'll most likely have leftovers for tomorrow. Service is great and everyone that works there is friendly and always checking up on you. Pricey....but worth every penny"}
{"text":"Another great dinner here at Lucille's...
I had the gumbo and a side of cheesy grits as a starter....
And, the banana pudding for desert.
Fast, friendly service as always.
Just a little bit of a wait, maybe 5 minutes, so busy, but not too busy."}
{"text":"Visited Lucille's for the second time this evening and it was great both times!  The ambiance, service, biscuits and cinnamon butter, barbecue ribs and pulled meats were all wonderful.   We will visit again and would recommend Lucille's!  My husband is on a quest to find the best BBQ ribs--  Lucille's did not disappoint!  A nice touch is the warm wash cloths given to us at the end of our meal!  How thoughtful!"}
{"text":"Went to Lucille's thanksgiving dinner, thankfully we had reservations! I ordered a lemon drop martini. Excellent! Our thanksgiving dinner was large. Lots of food. The turkey and ham were very smoky tasting to the point of being cloying. We had tons of food left so we brought it home. Next day I heated it up and that smoking flavor was so strong it was nauseating. My thoughts ran to whether the meat was actually smoked or Liquid smoke was used.

I've never eaten thanksgiving dinner out before and probably won't again. :-("}
{"text":"A long time family favorite where we enjoy the fried pickles, biscuits with cinnamon butter, ribs, mac n cheese, lemonade, and watermelon iced tea. No place like it in Metro Phoenix.."}
{"text":"I loved the service... I loved the food and it is a great atmosphere... The Mac and cheese is a MUST have!!! Thebbrisket is to die for and the prices are reasonable I got a huge platter for 24.00."}
{"text":"How depressing!  We used to frequent the Lucille's in green valley Nv.  I think it was one of the first and it was good good good.  So good we would do our business entertaining there.  When we moved home to Az we were very excited to find that they were putting one in Tempe.  Our first visit was good, but for some reason not as good as Vegas, but they were new and we figured they needed a chance to get started.  Second visit, still not so good, third visit, decided not to go back.  That was awhile ago.  Today, my daughter wanted to have lunch there and she only remembers the Nv Lucille's as she has been in Wa.  for a few years.  So we went.   Here's how it went......
She had a Cobb salad and ordered with no eggs, came covered in eggs, sent it back.  Came back with raw chicken......worried me cause although she took it off her salad, it had still touched the rest of her salad and she is breast feeding.  Her husbands fried chicken was so bad that he wouldn't eat it and that boy eats like crazy.  My son had the tri tip that was melt in your mouth in Vegas, but not here.  It was tough and fatty.  I had the sea food platter.  It was something I had never seen. It looked like it was coated with corn meal plastic.  Burnt corn meal plastic.  I peeled it off and there was a teeny tiny piece of cat fish in there.  The grilled artichoke was ok but the dip was wall paste, the fried okra was good, but hey, it's not fresh, it's frozen.  The sweet tea was wonderful and our waiter was nice.  Bottom line......go to Green Valley, next to Vegas.........skip Tempe.  It cost 92 dollars to eat lunch at Lucille's and I use the term \" eat\" loosely.  I feel like I was robbed!  Not one of us was happy.  
 I have a lot of good memories at Lucille's years ago, but that was then,  and  this is now.......and now they suck!!!"}
{"text":"Have driven cross town for Lucilles in The District many times because we loved it.  I was happy they opened at Red Rock and went to this location a few times but they did not seem to have the same quality food so stopped going for a year or so.  We were in the area yesterday and had a $5 off coupon so thought what the heck.  BIG mistake.  Service and atmosphere were great but food was not good at all.   My favorite are the onion straws and I ordered them as a side to my steak sandwich.  The were beyond crispy...cremated comes to mind.  The steak sandwich was supposed to be served on artisan type bread but this was hogie roll like you'd get at Sams Club and seemed stale.  The steak was very thick...not good for a sandwich.  In the past at the District it was usually sliced and cut in 4 smaller size portions which were easier to eat.  Another favorite is the bbq chicken salad that my husband had...he lettuce was soggy and dressing tasted funny.  I spoke to our waiter about my food and he did take my sandwich off the check but we will not be back to the RR location."}
{"text":"While standing in line at Costco, the couple in front of us were buying gift cards to Lucille's. They said we HAD to try it! I read some reviews here on Yelp and we decided to give it a go.

First of all, Hubby is from Kansas City (Bar-B-Que Headquarters of the USA) and VERY discerning when it comes to smoked meats! We decided to order a combo of Baby Back Ribs and Tri Tips. We had never heard of Tri Tips before and our server, Jill, did a great job of explaining the difference between them and Burnt Ends. 

The Tri Tips were tender, juicy and flavorful. The Ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious! We both were not impressed with the Original or the Memphis sauces, but the Hot and Spicy sauce was excellent!! We got Creamy Coleslaw and Honey Peanut Slaw for sides and both were delicious! We also ordered some Cornbread, which was yummy, and enjoyed the light, fluffy biscuits. I agree with other reviews that the biscuits really do not need the sugar on top!

For drinks we opted for a 1/2 caraf of Layer Cake Malbec, a delicious and a perfect pairing for the smokey meats!! We were impressed with the \"caraf\" option for wines, as we really didn't want a full bottle. 

We will definitely be returning and highly recommend getting the Gift Cards from Costco - $79 for 2 $50 Gift Cards."}
{"text":"This place is a little slice of heaven. There is not one thing on the menu that is not unreal. They smoke all of the meat there, so it is fresh out of the smoker. I would go early as there can be a wait. But if you do get stuck waiting, just pop into the bar for a mint julep, it will ease the pain as you become hungrier and that wonderful smoky smell has you in a trance. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Ok food, definitely not worth the price. I have had way better BBQ food at other establishments and I would not return here."}
{"text":"Came in for the Saturday night blues band. Professional group playing a mix of blues, r&b, classic and popular music.

Sat in the bar area and ordered the chix and 2 meat plate of tips. Luscious pink rings of smokiness around the proteins and crispy black nuggets of sweetness. Forgot that this is a chain restaurant because the smokiness flavor is penetrated in there. All the selections were super soft. Also, I like spicy, and the  'hot & spicy' sauce is perfect for me. The Caesar salad was \"twangy\" and refreshing, not fishy. Forgot to mention their sugar sprinkled biscuit and cinnamon butter. Its like starting with dessert !

Server Codie on point!"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs and pulled pork. Also had the peach lemonade, it was great. Our server was awesome. Definite recommend to anyone who loves BBQ. I will definitely go back again soon."}
{"text":"Rustic atmosphere, friendly service, great food; I have been coming here for years and find it to be one of the best barbecue houses in town. I recommend the BBQ chicken and Two meats; it's a great way to sample a variety of their grilled meats, the chicken is tender and juicy, the burnt ends are fabulous. Don't miss the house strawberry lemonade!"}
{"text":"Service was good. But the food? Where do I begin!!

First the food took like an hour for it to get to our table.  Then when we took a taste it was one disappointment after another!  The meats didn't taste very fresh at all. I lived in the south and if they are going to advertise BBQ they should learn to make ribs that falls off the bone instead of fighting with a dry piece of rib. 

Service on the other hand was good. If now the food can meet the service they would have a gold mine."}
{"text":"Went there with a few guys from work a little bit ago (Sorry i forgot to Yelp it :+( ) One of the guys was hyping this place up like there is no tomorrow, so naturally i was excited to go. Boy, was i disappointed. 

No, no! I knew its a big chain place. And i did not have my expectations jacked up through the roof despite my friend's hype. but boy, ohh boy it was even less exciting then i was expecting. Its hard to describe exactly what is wrong about it, but wrongness is just there. You know what i mean? Its just not as .... succulent? I do not know.

Its just not all that great and i am not interested to come back there. 

\"I like! NOT\""}
{"text":"Definitely great bbq! Ordered baby back ribs ribs, tri-tip & hot links. Sides were mac and cheese, potato salad and baked beans. The baked beans are amazing along with the ribs. They also have biscuits and honey sugar butter. A must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decide to bring my friends from California to this restaurant. We ordered the spinach dip that was nice and warm. My friends liked the chips. I had the Smoked Chicken Pasta and it was overloaded with thick sauce. The chicken was moist and tender. The Cesar Salad has wilted lettuce with crotons. My wife ordered the tri tip dinner which looked very appetizing. I guess the moral of this story is to order BBQ dinners."}
{"text":"I was instantly a fan of this place when I moved here. Previously I lived in Texas and that isn't Texas BBQ, but it's awesome for Vegas. They get an extra bump because they are close to home, they have convenient parking, and the food isn't overly pricey. At dinner time they can get really busy, but worth the wait if BBQ is your thing.

At this point I've had most of the items on the menu. My personal favorites are the baby back ribs, Mardi Gras chicken, and Big Easy BBQ shrimp. They have a wide variety of items on the menu so it'd be a good place for a group with a variety of tastes. 

Service is good for the most part, but can be slow at random times."}
{"text":"I've heard from family to try this place and I finally did. I don't know why I waited so long! Probably the best BBQ restaurant in the Las Vegas area (Henderson). 

My husband had the Front Porch which had chicken, sausage and ribs. The chicken was white meat but the most tender and juiciest white meat ever. I don't like to eat white meat that much so for me to love it is a big deal. 

I had the BBQ tri tip and it was the most amazing tri tip I've ever had. Juicy, tender and flavorful. Yum yum yum!!! 

Was not disappointed at all with the food, and the service was amazing too. I have a 1 year old and they had a family bathroom with a changing table. Always a plus for making it easy to bring my toddler around. Family friendly, great service and amazing food. A must have for awesome BBQ."}
{"text":"Bar service was so so. Food was average. That being said. I was a bit disappointed at my last visit here. On past occasions it was better. I will give them another chance but not on a Holiday. (July 4)."}
{"text":"Terrific food, great service and cool ambience. Had the Jambalaya. It was as good as the Jambalaya I've had in New Orleans. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Good service and good food, they have big variety of lunch. Baby back ribs are very tender, sausage had a lot of flavor and potato salad better then expected by far! Overall great environment with great food!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid barbecue chain in Vegas! It's a nice location located in the Red Rock Casino where this entertainment around the area. 

Can't complain about the service or food. Their complimentary biscuits are heavenly! The barbecue plates are super filling and slightly on the pricier side. I wasn't too much a fan of the brisket because it was more on the leaner side but I will definitely try a fattier cut on my next visit."}
{"text":"I love Lucille's. whenever I have a friend visiting AZ I usually end up taking them here. I have never left without being stupid full, and having another meal for later. 

The apple butter biscuits are dangerous - be careful not to fill up on them before the meal

Two meat combo is always a good choice, I like the St. Louis Ribs and Pulled Pork

We had the sampler app once, and it was just WAY to much food with the entrees, but if you have a group of 5 it would be nice. 

I love the ice tea selection, they have tons of not-sweetened fruit flavorings with unlimited refills. 

If you manager to save room, the Banana cream pudding is INCREDIBLE 

Love Lucille's, think i'm gonna pop in again soon"}
{"text":"I don't really know why I've been  putting this place off It's always been rated a TOP 10 restaurant in Las Vegas/Henderson.

Well no more, I did it and what a suprise! When it comes to chain places expectations are relatively low.

Right off you'll love this place-outdoor seating lots of indoor seating and a bar-incredibly friendly staff and the place feels 100% BBQ with the smoker going right in the dining room.

They start you off with Sweet Tea in a mason jar and a sprig of mint then some biscuits with Apple BUtter.

We ordered the 3 course FEAST for 2 and the Ribs & Tri-Tip Lunch Special to-go.

The food came out in a very timely manner. We started off with the biscuits and a house salad for 2.

Next came the BBQ platter-1/2 bbq chicken,4 St Louis Style Ribs, 4 Babyback Ribs and 1/4 Lb of Beef Brisket. Plus we had 2 sides-Mashed Sweet Potaotes and Macaroni and Cheese.

The food was fantastic. Apple-wood smoked meat-great smoke flavor tender & moist. Plus they have 3 sauces-Memphis,Regular & Hot/Spicy-All were great but I luv the Hot stuff.

The brisket was by far the BEST anywhere in Las Vegas!! The Ribs were Fantastic-Smoked through and Tender. The Tri Tip was out of this world too!!

Definitely a TOP BBQ joint in Las Vegas/Henderson!:)
If this place was closer, not so pricy and had a drive-thru I would be 400 lbs by Xmas!!"}
{"text":"solid BBQ but they have lost touch with reality with their prices..."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and it was okay. We came for lunch and the server was very attentive. However, the food itself was just okay. It didn't blow me out of the water or anything. I feel like I could go to Bobby Q's in North phoenix and have it be much better. Nothing about this place is particularly bad, but the food is definitely over priced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Lucille's is right next to the Red Rock Casino. Parking is scarce on weekends, so we parked at the Red Rock Parking Garage and walked 5 minutes. We made a reservation online, so we didn't have to wait 40 minutes like many.

It was good solid food, but not great or spectacular. I ordered my favorite type of BBQ, beef brisket, and my wife had a Tri Tip Salad.  

The service was a bit slow, but somewhat understandable due to the amount of people there.  The place was nice and clean.

We are glad we went, but might not go back unless we are in the area and in the mood for BBQ.  Another restaurant in town has a better Texas Brisket."}
{"text":"The food is very, very good.  The time you wait to get someone to bring you a menu or some bread not so much.  Improve the staff and you will get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"After a \"ok\" experience before, we tried Lucille's again and this it was a very solid experience. The blackened chicken sandwich was really, really good. Definitely will be back and thank you for inviting us back."}
{"text":"Normally love Lucilles. Ordered delivery for the first time through Bite Squad and am thoroughly disappointed. The food was not to the in-dining standard but the price was the same plus delivery and gratuity. The nachos were the worst! Might as well have ordered complimentary chips. Not good Lucilles.

Update:
Since my post, I was contacted by Lucille's. I am so impressed and appreciative of how they handled my personal experience with them. They truly took ownership and were more than courteous. Bradley & Tonya@GVR you two are amazing. Thank you for everything."}
{"text":"What southern style restaurant serving collard/turnip greens doesn't have PEPPER VINEGAR??? It is a condiment all southern restaurants have for their greens and most people who order them eat them with pepper vinegar. Why would you have one and not the other? The waiter even looked like I had two heads when I asked for some. I would have not ordered the greens had I known that they do not carry pepper vinegar. I'm very disappointed, I just wanted a taste of home."}
{"text":"The food was terrible not even seasoned . We had the pleasure of looking at a dirty table the entire time we were eating . I will NOT be back"}
{"text":"We have had many positive experiences with Lucille's. One server went out of his way to give us a great experience and we had a blast. The next time in we couldn't get anyone over to the table for anything. The last time we made reservations we had to wait 45 minutes after the reservation time. Not acceptable. Didn't go back for several months. (that was also the visit where we couldn't get a server to do anything for us.) While comparably priced with other BBQ restaurants around town, for the money I expect better, more consistent service. When it is good it is great, unfortunately we have had too many unfortunate experiences. For lunch you can't go wrong with one of their sandwiches, pulled pork, ti-tip or brisket all tasty. For supper go with a combo platter. You get to sample a little of everything and have lunch the next day. Favorites would be the baby back ribs, tri-tip, garlic mashed potatoes and mac & cheese. The biscuits and cinnamon butter are a great compliment to your meal. They are located in the District at GVR. At times parking is a bit sparse but we have always found something. One nice thing is that after your meal you can wander around the store and shops at the District and work off some of your meal. Summary - they are close to the house and the food is good, service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant.  I will come back whenever I have a chance.  

The services/the servers are nice.  They are consistent with their skills.  Not once I got a bad service from them.

I love the Beef Ribs.  It is delicious.  I went to Bobby Q and Rustler's Rooster.  Lucille tastes a lot better.

Tons of parking.  Tons of shop to walk around after I pig myself out....hehehe"}
{"text":"mmm..well the fish place nearby was a longer wait, so we went here...it was busy, and crowded.  I like ribs as much as anyone, however i had never really ventured beyond home made ribs and chilis babyback ribs. So my first time at lucilles, we ordered like a combo plate or some sorts.  

the ribs, well i reviewed another lucilles and i have this to say - i could taste the lighter fluid...is that the smoky taste alot of people are referencing?

i did like the mashed sweet potatoes, really its all i ate, bread was good too, and so was my iced tea.  Sorry lucilles, i am not a fan...

highlight was that we saw some actor with his family there that night, dunno his name, an im too distraught over these overpriced ribs to google it, but hes on the show, without a trace, the Caucasian guy...yeah, thats him...

wish i could say NEVER AGAIN to lucilles, but you sadly this is my sister's favorite and she chooses this place when its her turn to choose...bummer"}
{"text":"A very enjoyable Barbecue chain. A lot of people have suggested that I try Lucille's but my desire to do so had been low. Probably because from the outside it looks like just another overpriced family restaurant. Now that I've been inside, it kind of gives you that impression when you walk in, too. There's a decent decor, but there's also all that junk on the wall that gives it an Applebee's kind of feel. Long lines to get in (mostly due to huge parties) also don't help out. 

Fortunately, the food is really good. 

You get biscuits with a side of maple butter which is quite enjoyable. We started with a half order of onion straws. Unless you're with a big group stick to the smaller size. Even though these fried strips of onion were addicting and hard to stop eating, it was still too much for just two people. The BBQ ranch sauce its served with is also really good (and I am not a big ranch fan). 

Both my girlfriend and I had sandwiches as our meals. I went with the brisket and portabello with honey roasted peanut slaw. The brisket was wonderful. Not too soft like most places tend to serve it when in sandwich form. Can't say that I was a big fan of slaw. Nothing special about it, and the vinegar in the recipe just didn't do it for me, and the peanuts didn't add anything to the flavor, they just felt thrown in. 

My girlfriend had the Smokehouse sliders with BBQ chicken. While they give you the option of pork, chicken, or brisket, Lucille's doesn't let you mix and match which you want. I really don't get that policy consider there isn't a price difference between the meats. It's not like they're smoking it up on order (and if they are, there's a big problem considering it takes hours to smoke meat). I guess it's too hard to the kitchen staff to grab from two different places. Either way, she enjoyed the chicken. She had a side of sweet potato fries which were really good. 

Like most Barbecue chains, Lucille's pimps its own sauces. The three that were brought to the table were original (the best; loaded with flavor), Hot and Spicy (neither hot or spicy, not bad, just not close to what I was expecting), and Memphis style (I'm not familiar with Memphis style barbecue, but this was pretty much just ketchup). I recommend sticking to the original. 

We chose to sit in the bar (open seating and full menu) to avoid a short Sunday night wait and watch the basketball game. There's four big TVs placed across the bar, but someone did a very bad job placing them in their spots. There's a couple of support beams in the room which block the views. We easily found a seat that allowed us to see the game were were interested in, but my view of the TVs playing the baseball game were blocked.

Overall, the place isn't much to look at, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Great service, good food.

Art was our server the last two times eating here. He handles being busy well, and gives great customer service while multitasking. The food is amazing, and you get good sized portions for your money. The spinach and artichoke dip is great. I usually get the pulled pork sandwich which is so good after you soak it in one of their BBQ sauces."}
{"text":"Food was good although I did expect a little more being food was ridiculously expensive..and service was just ok.. which is understandable being it was so busy for Father's Day.. I'm sure any other day our waiter would've been a little more attentive to our needs..3 stars because of the prices and almost absent waiter.."}
{"text":"The drinks kinda took a while to come out as well as the bread, we were a big party but it was not busy at all. But over all good place t eat. The only flaw would be over price."}
{"text":"I remember when there's was only one Lucille's in Vegas. It was in Henderson, which was really far from our house, so we never went there. Our go-to place for BBQ was Famous Dave's. One thing that's better at Lucille's is that they had beef and pork ribs and Famous Dave's didn't. Once we heard that a location of Lucille's was opening at Red Rock Hotel, which was nearby our house we wanted to go. Now I will tell you my experience...

     Me and my family first walked in during dinner time, the service was pretty kind. Then we got seated in 4-5 minutes and our table was clean. After looking through the menu everything looked and sounded so yummy. Our kind waiter came in asking what drinks we wanted, there was a good amount of drink choices. The drinks were pretty good then we ordered. We waited around 10-15 minutes for our food and it was very very yummy. The food costed a normal price, but if you want to save money and have a Costco membership I have a tip for you.

     So, right across the street is Costco, when you go inside head to the gift cards. Then buy the gift card which is 45-49 dollars (forgot) for two twenty five dollar gift card. Then buy it and use it at the restaurant, you just saved some money!

     Also I should mention, you should park outside. Lucile's has a entrance outside, it's right next to Yard House."}
{"text":"My new favorite bbq place in town , except the cocktail from the bar all the appetizers and side dishes were excellent. Full of rack is really full the bones come right off, awesome tastes."}
{"text":"I have never been so out done w/ Lucille's!  We were told a 15 minute wait, n after asking for a table instead of a booth, we were made to wait an additional 15 minutes n then told the reason it took longer was because they were putting a table together, now what is a shame is that they already had tables of 6 that we cud have sat at. After asking again why it was taking so long we were given apologies, to have a young man come to escort us, who walked backwards the entire way to the smallest table of 6 that was in the restaurant.  First off any one that thinks walking backwards while talking to your customers is great customer service is badly mistaken.  In this environment in our society to not feel this was intentional because we are people of color is very difficult.  We walked right out of the restaurant by 2 Managers not one of them even stopped us to inquire why we were leaving.  But that's okay we're from Calif and have Lucille's n r area, because we will never come to this one again!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place and have hosted numerous parties here. However, I wanted to point out the recent incident that occurred for our last event which is why I am unable to give this review 5 full stars. 

With the amounts of engagement parties, baptism receptions, and birthdays we've celebrated here we have never encountered this incident. Prior to my event on 02/26, I called the restaurant to assure that my reservation was 1. not only in place, but 2. to see what time we were able to come in for set up. The attendant on the phone gladly told me that I was more than welcome to come in at 5:30 to set up my decorations, as the room should already begin it's set up. The lady also said she would write a note on our reservation details to let the staff know I was coming. 

When I had walked in at 6:30 on 02/27 (date of event) I noticed that there were people seated in the private room area we normally booked. I was confused, so i went to the hostess, Kaycee. She has told me that i was not able to enter the room until my reservation at 7pm, and that we would not be seated until at LEAST half of the party arrived. This was a major shocker since I called ahead of time, and I still came an hour later than the agreed set up time. I immediately asked for the manager, who may I say handled the situation great. But as we were waiting for him to come, three of the staff members behind the counter, Kaycee, Francis, and Tyler were stating negative remarks talking about my family and I who were STILL standing in front of their counter listening. 

That to me was not quality service as it is never okay to talk about a customer in front of their faces. In ANY business. This behavior is NOT acceptable. 

Thankfully the staff that handled our event were so friendly, the servers and the manager who continually checked up on us. They are the reasons why we will still continue to return. However, hopefully upon our next visit this issue will have clearly been resolved and we will not have to encounter such inappropriate behavior."}
{"text":"While in town for training and staying with a family friend, Mike brought me to this delicious restaurant within the Red Rock casino.  The four of us were quickly seated in orders were taken. I ordered the barbecue bacon burger and an appetizer of onion straws.  The onion straw appetizer was deliciously crunchy and micro cut into slivers of deliciousness. I'm usually not a hamburger eater but this burger was so delicious I ate until my stomach was full and I was uncomfortably stuffed!  The burger came with a side of crunchy homemade coleslaw which was delicious all in itself.  Maybe I shouldn't of ate so many onion straws!  I recommend this place for anyone to try when in the Red Rock area."}
{"text":"Clean fast and great table service Brett was on point. The food was good I had the fried chicken I was pretty disappointed not a good version of it chicken was juicy the veggies were hot the mash potatoes and gray were great but the breading on the chicken and the seasoning not to great. overall great experience and good costumer service"}
{"text":"Second time here, and it was fantastic. Our server Kaleigh took fantastic care of us (aside from trying to make us gain as much weight as possible... but I understand that's the southern hospitality way). 

I put a couple pictures up so you can imagine what to expect here. But they have a brisket that might be able to cure diseases. I wish I was being sarcastic. It was THAT good. Their macaroni had that baked hard cheese top that made the perfect texture, and the BBQ pork (specifically with their Memphis sauce) is physically giving me withdrawals already one day later. 

Take your New Years resolution and shut up. Just cheat this one time. So worth it."}
{"text":"Bradley, the business manager, contacted me in an effort to apologize and try to fix the problems I complained about in an earlier review. His note and willingness to listen and pay attention is enough to change my review. Thank you, Bradley. (By the way, my original issue was that I felt ignored. You paid attention.I"}
{"text":"Went in to celebrate father's day. Hubby was given a $10 gift card as a happy Father's day gift from staff. NICE! Portions a huge so sharing is a must. I got the smoked ckn, cheese grits and collard greens. Amazing! Hubby had the tri trip and fries. So tender. 3 different BBQ sauces on the table to choose from including good old memphis  BBQ sauce. And those biscuits and apple butter hit the spot. They also have a descent bev menu. Beer and BBQ and great atmosphere yummy ! Staff is very friendly !!Art was our server he did a wonderful job!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit on a Sunday night.  We entered through the Red Rock Casino rather  than from the outside door.

The hostess was very friendly.  She seated us and talked to us for a few minutes.  The server was also friendly, but very busy.  It took about 20 minutes to get our warm biscuits with Apple Cinnamon Butter  that I had been craving since my first visit.

We shared the St Louis rib platter that came with 2 sides.  The ribs were meaty and tender.  I actually preferred them over the Baby Back ribs.
The sweet potato fries were ok.  The Honey Roasted Peanut Slaw was a little too acidic.

We were brought out warm towels for our hands at the end of our meal.

We had a $5 off coupon for signing up for their Preferred Guest emails.  One of the managers took off the discount on our bill.

We will be back for the biscuits and Apple Cinnamon Butter."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Ribs were tough and dry. Only good things were the size of drinks and the hot towels after eating. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Kid friendly, Nice food, and 3 signature Bar-B-Que sauces excellent food! The staffs are nice, they smoke the meats and they are really good. They have kids menu. They are not so expensive but not so cheap. They have great burgers!"}
{"text":"The best southern fried chicken on the planet.  Ask for the coleslaw; you won't be disappointed. Get extra Gravy for the biscuits. 

Food is always hot. 
Service can range from excellent to ok. 
Banana pudding is to die for!!!"}
{"text":"MMM ... Yeup, you best believe I can get rocked with the BBQ at Lucille's!  

Oh, sure, there'll be a lot of reviews here pointing out it's chain-ness, the cheesy decor, etc. yet when you're at Tempe Marketplace, this is an excellent dining option.

I'm still sad they pulled the Carolina Style Pulled Pork from the menu. 

As much as I hate to pay $5 for a freaking strawberry lemonade, I get it just about every.freaking.time. It is that good! 

The biscuits with apple butter are heavenly. 

My last trip in, Dude and I split the two meat combo: Pulled Pork and Tri Tip, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese for our two sides.  

The pulled pork was just alright, kind of tough. The tri tip though? Phenomenal. Sauce it up for a good time. 

Mac and cheese is sinfully delicious. Heck, I'd drop in for just a bowl of that stuff. The server claimed there is bacon in it; however, I wasn't able to detect any. 

Friendly service, BBQ comfort food  . . . Just bring your stretchy pants, 'cause you're going to need them."}
{"text":"For our occasional Happy Hour get-together with some of the friends in my development, we chose Lucille's this time.  It was new to six of us, and suggested by #7, who'd been there before.

I called the day before because we needed a special accommodation for one friend who's in a wheelchair.  The manager, Evan, graciously said that we could sit right outside the bar area, where there were regular tables.  But when we arrived, we were seated at a booth.  They did allow us to move, though, which was helpful when we ended up being two more than originally scheduled.

Our waitress, Barbie, started out great, but dropped the ball early.  One drink was never brought.  A water refill required two requests before it was done.  One friend had to send her burger back, but it wasn't returned until we were all nearly done eating, and then only after she corralled a different waiter to get her food.  With our drinks empty and 20 minutes to go before HH ended, we were never asked if anyone wanted another drink.  I was a little miffed that at the end, my friends decided to not only give the waitress a break, but even to go slightly above the 20% tip.  I wouldn't have stiffed her, but sure wouldn't have been that generous.

I had the Cuervo margarita, and it was very good.  One friend ordered the strawberry lemonade, and only liked it after she had them add a shot of vodka to it.  She didn't get a sense of any of it in there the way it should have been.

Now for the food:  the complimentary biscuits were good, even for this non-biscuit lover, but they didn't need the sugar sprinkled on top.  I like to save my calories for more important things.

Almost everyone ordered something different, so I got to taste most of the HH offerings.  I had gumbo and a blackened chicken quesadilla.   The gumbo was more like a stew, the thickest one I've ever eaten.  It came with a small mold of white rice on top.  It had good flavor and just the right amount of spice for me, but way too much salt.  What it didn't have was a single piece of okra and not a shrimp in sight.  A friend who also had it found one little shrimp in hers, but also no okra.

My quesadilla was okay, nothing to write home about.  Not a lot of chicken, and the chicken was barely blackened.  The one thing I can recommend is the wedge salad, ordered by another friend.  It was huge, and would have been a much better accompaniment to my gumbo.

The rib tips were dry.  Isn't this a rib place????  Glad I didn't order them.  I didn't taste the pulled pork sliders, but they looked juicy and my friend said they were.  Fried tomatoes - a new experience for the northerners among us (and that's all of us, except for the one Australian!) - were devoured happily.

Overall, Lucille's is okay, but just okay.  I don't think I'll use my gambling points to rush back."}
{"text":"I've been to Lucille's three times at Red Rock.  Two out of the three were disastrous, and I reviewed them appropriately.  But this time we were meeting Henderson friends for dinner.  When she suggested Lucille's in her area, I told her about our mishaps at RR.  She'd also had a couple of unfortunate dinners there, but assured me that this one was much better, so we figured we'd give it a try.

If one of the other three had written this review, they'd probably give it 5 stars, but I, the Queen of Kvetch (Google it or watch the movie Norma Rae), wasn't quite as pleased.  Still, it was heads above the other place.

I was the only one drinking, so I ordered my usual glass of Riesling.  It tasted like gasoline.  The waitress, Lisa (who was a real sweetheart), cheerfully changed it for a white zin.  That one may have been the worst white zin I've ever had, but I kept it anyway.

Our friends had the ribs and loved 'em.  Herb made the better choice, ordering the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portobello Sandwich.  If I had done that, I would have been much happier.  My brisket was shredded, and I didn't notice that in the menu description.  I like slices.  The brisket itself was delicious - moist and not fatty.  But my sandwich was just brisket, with nothing to offset or complement the meat.  Herb's had the portobello, but also sauteed onion.  My other bad choice wouldn't have gotten better no matter what I chose:  the default was a soft potato bun.  When I eat a sandwich, I crave dense bread with a hard, crusty crust.  After being in Vegas for ten years, I've come to the realization that it doesn't exist here, the way it does on the East coast or California or Chicago, or probably even Iowa...everywhere but in Vegas.  I swapped the soft bun for the baguette, which turned out to be just a different shape of soft bun.

Without my asking, the manager came over, very concerned, and asked if I wanted some other bread or something else entirely.  Since other bread wouldn't end up being what I was craving, I kept the sandwich.  And to my surprise, she comped the sandwich.  But I did like that brisket, and shouldn't eat all that bread anyway.

If the wine hadn't been so awful I would have given Lucille's 4 stars.  Everyone else enjoyed their meal, and the poor choice of sandwich was mostly mine.  The service was excellent, and it's obvious - even at the Lucille's at Red Rock - that management really cares about the guests.  On second thought, I'm upping it to 4."}
{"text":"A friend invited me over for dinner at this place with his family and friends.  I am glad I took his invitation.  The waiting and serving staff were excellent, they were very helpful.  I ordered a large bowl of jambalaya, it was mouth watering and delicious. Bread rolls were made fresh, peach tea is excellent.  Recommend this place to anyone.  I rate this place a four star because I didn't try there ribs."}
{"text":"As barbecue places go, this one has to be near the top.  The brisket was outstanding. Smoked perfectly to be moist but extremely tender.  Their selection of sauces range from a traditional to a spicy.  They all go well with the food.  

I tried a variety of starters, all of which were wonderful. 

The only \"problem\" is that I live in Ohio and they are a West Coast company.  Aside from that...delicious!"}
{"text":"Did takeout. Brisket sandwich with mac and cheese. The brisket was SO shredded it was unidentifiable and it didn't have any beef flavor. The Mac and cheese was average. So sad I didn't care for this."}
{"text":"It's the little things that bring me here like their Fried Green Tomatoes and my mom not wanting to leave the slots so I figured we should do dinner while we wait. This Luciille's is in the  Red Rock Casino so if you are with people who are gambling you can simply sit it out and have a meal instead. 

When ever I come here I start with the Fried Green Tomatoes because it's rare that I find it in any of the restaurants I go to. Truthfully ever since I read the book \" Fried Green Tomatoes \" in high school I've liked this dish and it's trouble some to make so I'm glad Lucilles offers this as an appetizer. The tomatoes are fried in what looks like cornmeal it's crispy and the sauce is cream based. I doubt if they are fried in bacon grease like it states in the book but hey are still delightful! 

I decided to get another appetizer so I can get exactly what I want so I ordered their fried shrimp. I know that it is two fried things in a row but trust me I'm southern at heart! I prefer their mustard dip to the tarter sauce because it's has a little more kick to it. 

It was my birthday month so my husband mentioned my birthday and they also sent out a colorful birthday treat . Chocolate cake , vanillia ice cream with sprinkles ! Yum! 

Our server was awesome he kept checking on us and tended to everything we needed from more bread , refills etc. He also packed us more bread and honey butter to go. Excellent service !"}
{"text":"THIS WILL BE MY LAST THANKSGIVING HERE AT LUCILLE'S
We have eaten our Thanksgiving dinner at Lucille's for the past 5 years, but this will be our Last
They service was substandard and the food has gone downhill.
I made our reservation for a party of 5 three weeks in advance, yet they sat us at a tiny table hardly big enough for four people. I even pointed out to the waitress that we we're ordering the $200.00 family feast and that there would Not be enough room for the food dishes. She said she would \"check\" for another table. Instead they sat a party of two at the table for 6, right next to us. We had to put stuff from the table, BBQ sauce, sugar etc. on the floor in order to make room for the food!
They bring the salad to the table and before we can even serve it to anyone they are bring out the main course!! We had to Not eat our salad, box it up in order to make room for the main dishes. 
The turkey and stuffing were Great. The ham was dried out and the green bean casserole was horrible. The mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes were delicious. 
In retrospect, I should have said \"Sorry, no way we can sit here.\" 
I work to hard for my money to ever waist it here again. There are to many other choices that won't allow this to happen."}
{"text":"The BEST thing about this restaurant is the cute atmosphere and decor.  The pulled pork sandwich was just OK, it was very bland without flavor on its own.  I put the original BBQ sauce (which was so watery and thin - also very tasteless)  on it, still needed flavor so I added alittle more spicier sauce and it was better.  The side of fries (shoestring) potatoes was not hot at all, barely warm but just OK.

I probably would try this again to see if I had a better experience.
Service was SLOW, but good.
Prices alittle on the high side for what you get, but pretty comparable."}
{"text":"Great place for ribs, nice and smoky served naked with the sauce on the side the way i like it. I got the full rack of St. Louis ribs perfectly cooked  and i am stuffed. Unlike other rib/smoked meat joints this place also has good sides. I had the mac-n-cheese and peanut slaw both were good. Always a wait but worth it."}
{"text":"Excellent tri-tip quesadilla and brisket.  Too-die-for sweet biscuits and honey butter.  Good chicken.  Steer clear of the sweet potato side dish and (what a waste of a) roasted artichoke."}
{"text":"I will say four things.  Order the smoked tri tip.  Use their Memphis BBQ.  It's excellent!  Servers were sweet hearts."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has only 3.5 stars. If you're giving them 2 stars because it isn't the style of bbq you're used to, please shut up. That's a personal preference, not a knock on the food or service they deliver. Judge the place based on how close they meet the mark of what they're aiming for. As far as I'm concerned this is exactly the place I want to come to when I've got a craving for some bbq. The flavor is great, the sauces are good, the variety is all you could ask for and the portions leave me feeling stuffed. I got the front porch and each item was pleasing: Fall of the bone ribs, flavor packed sausage, juicy chicken (the dark meat anyway...white meat was a bit dry). I reserve the 5th star partly for the white meat, partly for the mediocre mac and cheese and partly because I have had better bbq sauce and find that I only really enjoy the \"original\" sauce out of the three offered. Other places have more sauce options and I like more of said options. Minor criticisms."}
{"text":"After a dreadful experience next door @ Green Valley Ranch Hotel we went for a walk and stumbled across this awesome find.    My 3 girls and I were int town for a soccer tournament and not all establishments welcomed kids in town.   This place was a refreshing find.   Sat on the deck without a reservation and Alfonso was our server.   Honestly the best server I've ever had in my life.   It was so nice to hVe someone nice to kids when everyone else had been so rude and insulting.   We were there for a soccer tournament.   Otherwise I would never bring my kids to Vegas.    He was fun and attentive without being annoying or too much.  He was great with my girls and their huge appetites.  Suggested kids meals which were so good they licked the plates (sliced beef and mac n cheese) My 13 year old and I split the baby back ribs and 2 sides.  OMG best I've ever tasted...little fat. The bisquits and butter were amazing.   Baked potato was amazing.   Chocolate cake was amazing.   My 13 year old also said \"they should do an undercover boss show here\" to get Alfonso a car or something.  It was that outstanding.     The best  \"bet\" we took in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place was perfect and a great find. Had a drink at the bar and the bartender said the BBQ combos was great for a first timer. I decided to just get the two meat combo. Beef ribs, brisket, cheesy grits, and honey peanut slaw covered the plate. Three ribs were so tender and meaty. Brisket melted in my mouth. The smoke is good here and I would definitely return. No need for an appetizer or dessert. The biscuits and apple butter act as both. To be totally honest, what you want is on the dinner plate. Only wish I had tried more choices. Guess I'll have to next time."}
{"text":"From the outside, Lucille's has the genteel charm of a building you'd find somewhere in the south, like New Orleans.
Inside, the ambiance and decor match her exterior; warm and hospitable. 

If only the food was good. 
I tried the barbecue chicken sandwich, it came with a choice of many sides...I selected the collard greens.
Typically, when one goes to a barbecue joint, ordering the bbq chicken sandwich, the expectation is a large bun with shredded barbecued chicken piled high atop one of the buns. Not here.

Oh there's a large bun alright, but it's there for all the wrong reasons...serving as camouflage for what it's concealing. 
At first blush, it looks large and delicious, but if you're a food sleuth like me, you'll want to inspect its contents.  Here are the results of my examination.

Removed top bun.
Removed the kale leaves and glob of fried shoestring onions that gave it all its height. Huge disappointment, no chicken in plain sight. Only a large glob of melted cheese.
Removed the cheese to find, and this is no exaggeration, a thin piece of chicken breast with a little barbecue sauce puddle it was swimming in. The size of the breast was approximately 2 x 2-1/2 inches, or roughly a third the size of the bun it was sitting in. 
Try to imagine this. 
This was like the motherlode of all things deceptive. 

When I want a barbecue chicken sandwich, I want a huge glob of chicken slathered in sauce on a large bun. 
Not the kind of false hope Lucille's is serving up.  
Not going back. But I will admire the architecture as I cruise the parking lot.
Lucille's sucks balls."}
{"text":"It is with heavy heart I report that Lucille's, brand new to Phoenix, does not live up to its hype. 

For shame this place could boast such fine decor, beautiful menus, and pleasant hospitable staff and then char the short ribs to the bone, inedible. If it wasn't for the thick sliced, juicy, fried green tomato appetizer I'd call the place a total bust. The flaky warm biscuits were nice with the honeyed sweet butter, but I know Bisquick when I taste it and I'm sure I've made these before at home. We had high hopes ordering up some blackened catfish, baby back ribs, beef brisket, chicken halves, greens, cheesy grits, garlic mashed potatoes, and a kids meal for the little one with fresh watermelon. First round was the wonderful mason jar drinks, Strawberry lemonade was sweet, fresh and thirst quenching, our muddy waters made with sweet tea and porch lemonade were good enough for three refills a piece. You'll understand however that the refills just had to keep comin' when I explain how the main course turned out.

First they served up the catfish. I could hardly see the fillet behind the nearly three cups of potatoes. When I did taste it I realized this wasn't a blackened catfish this was a water filled thin sliced sponge someone left in the charcoal pile. No wonder it was hidden by the taters. Unfortunately, they were a mass of stickiness with dried chives. I didn't find a hint of butter, or garlic for that matter. My partner is Irish through and through and was dismayed. We didn't even bother putting black pepper on them or finishing them at all. I was excited to try the cheesy grits though. My first fork pulled out a warm melting bite and so I offered some to the little one, with some greens to broaden her Northern palate. The greens were fine, but lacking in the advertised apple-wood smoked bacon. It was more like a chicken bouillon broth. She opted not to have more of either. When I went to have more grits the mixture had cooled and was more of a 4th grade science project than a good feeling.

Then came the meat platter. The chickens looked delectable and I quickly separated the meats from the bone. The dark meats were juicy, but the skin slipped off in a greasy way. The white meat was far too dry for my taste, but fortunately there were three bottled sauces we could mix together to dredge it through. Of course I believe that in a good BBQ the meat can stand on its own and you shouldn't have to dredge it in sauce to enjoy it. The brisket stood on its own. In fact it probably stood all by its lonesome out on a counter for an hour before it reached our table. Maybe cooking it in a bag instead of a dehydrator would have been a smarter method. Then came the hope of the evening, the lump of coal left to taste was apparently five baby back ribs. I had to saw them apart with a knife to free them from the creosote. The limited meat was not even worth trying to eat despite the three table sauces expertly blended to perfection waiting nearby. We tossed it back on the plate with the bones in disgust.

My daughter couldn't determine if her fries were fries or potato chips or onion straws, she decided she didn't really want them. The macaroni and cheese side was a small serving of elbow macaroni which seemed buttered lightly. Her standard is no name instant, the kind you used to buy 5 for a dollar and she was wondering where the cheese was. If I hadn't allowed the poor thing to eat the rest of the biscuits she would have gone home hungry. I will never understand how you can serve a watermelon that isn't juicy. The fruit is 90% water, but hers was an anemic example with seeds. For sure, the place had some fine appetizers and the desserts looked absolutely divine, but we were done before we even got to them and the check was already too high to consider salvaging the meal with a one pound apple pie slice. I cringed when they dropped off a comment card, but in the end I did the right thing and filled it out fair. When I want a great BBQ I think I'll be sticking to BobbyQ's where the St. Louis ribs are rubbed right and then bathed in a sauce you can't stop lickin' and where they send you home with beignets even if you don't order any, courtesy of the house."}
{"text":"Not entirely amazed with this place sorry to say.

In terms of authentic Lucille's definitely gets an A+, all drinks are served in cute mason jars and the inside decor is cute and has a comfy, cozy \"ma's kitchen\" feel. 

Not too impressed with the menu, maybe it's just me but I felt that there was a lack of selections. I went with the fried chicken breast, served with garlic mash and veggies topped with country style gravy and my husband picked a rack of ribs, I hate to compare but Famous Dave's wins in the food category by far.

Service wasn't amazing but the entire experience all in all was so so."}
{"text":"As someone from Oklahoma, we've got a lot of bbq. This bbq was just as good as any place in a more traditionally known for bbq state. I got the fried chicken and the breading was very good.

{"text":"Thanksgiving 2017..Beautiful day, family coming in from other states..20 family members show up at 3:00 and are I mention this is they were all seated after us.. finally seated. we are crammed into another room with others. Why I mention this is that they were all seated after us. The Restaurant was overloaded with diners.The Fire dept. would have closed them for this. So anyway we finally got some beverages after 30 min of sitting and waiting. One of the employees approached the table and spoke to the person who had made the reservation over a month ago, asking who had she spoken to about the reservations. Now mind you there had been communication 3 times that to include Lucilles calling her the night before. Next, we were all handed salad plates and we received some biscuits.  Another 30 or so minutes went buy and after some complaints we were served some Turkey and Ham on platters.. few minutes goes by and we received some mashed potatoes, and than after a few some dressing, Not sure if we ever got any cranberry sauce, and than some sweet potatoes..The real joke came next we were delivered a platter of salad after all the above..Now we were prepared because we still had our salad plates, I even asked is this normal and the waitress asked if I wanted a bigger plate.. Hilarious. unfortunately all of us had used them for the dinner.I had used a bread plate for my potatoes.At the end of this joke a waiter came out asking if anyone wanted pie..Hmm some had whipped cream some didnt. All in all this was the worst Thanksgiving .Shame on Lucilles,. Best part..we paid for it..No compensation, no apology"}

We went to bingo and he decided on BBQ.  
This experience was a lot better than the last two for sure.
I opted for the usual burger and dad got the front porch.  Chicken, sausage and ribs w mac and cheese and grilled veggies.  I tasted his veggies and they were outstanding.  He said the meat was also very good.
My burger was delicious.
Service was fast, food was hot and they are restoring my faith :)"}
{"text":"My family and I dined here Sunday around 5. Let me just start off saying that service was just never even better than average. We started with Daisy then went to John but Daisy did not come tell us that she was leaving and we were looking for her for about 15 minutes until John stopped by and said, hey I'm taking over for Daisy let me know if you need anything. Both servers should go to the table and introduce the other.

 So then we were upset with John because we still didn't get attention. I thought maybe things would get better but they never did. We love Lucilles bbq and unfortunately it'll be a while until we come back. Ribs and Mac n cheese were delicious though. For being inside the Red Rock and having most customers as locals, you guys need to step up your customer service or go work at a fast food chain instead."}
{"text":"Our favorite date night place. Live jazz on Saturdays. Open seating in bar. We always ask for our favorite server Alyssa or Ashley.  Grilled Salmon and sweet potato fries, or tri-tip dinner. The best!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best barbeque in Phoenix. Toss in deep fried pickles and blues and I don't know how you can go wrong. Blues, brews and BBQ! Not to mention some the best sweet corn this side of the Mississippi."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day. Definitely not impressed, but it could be worse. First drink order was wrong. Pulled pork sandwich came out with the bottom bun literally soaked through - disgusting. They remade it using a very thick brioche style bun that was all wrong for a pulled pork sandwich so I ate the meat without a bun. The meat was a C-minus at best. Tasted much more like a sloppy joe than bbq pulled pork. For the side I got macaroni and cheese which was also very disappointing. It's a very thin cheese sauce that has almost no flavor, topped with a little melted cheddar to cover it up but makes no difference on taste. The cost for our meal was $60 -_-"}
{"text":"the service was great and the food was sooo good!!! fresh and delicious!!! the tri tip sandwich is amazing a  must try and the burgers!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I expected more out a 4/5 rated place with so many positive reviews. Hubby and I stopped by for late lunch a couple days ago after working up quite an appetite on a hike. We caught the end of lunch specials just in time. The platter allows you to choose three meats and one side. We each got our own in order to maximize the meat selection. Here's what we tried...

Burnt Ends - This is the one we were the most excited to try, so we each picked it as one of our meats. Unfortunately, it ended up being the most disappointing. It wasn't tender, it was quite chewy. It also had absolutely zero flavor. 

STL Ribs - VERY dry and only so-so flavor. I don't think I've ever had meat THIS DRY at a BBQ restaurant. 

Smoked Sausage - Now this was solidly decent, but I've certainly had better. It had just a tiny bit of heat and some good flavor. 

Pulled Pork - Actually, surprisingly nice! I find that pulled pork is usually completely under seasoned and has to be covered with copious amounts of sauce. But not only did this have some decent flavors going on, but it was actually the most tender and juicy of all their meats. 

Baby Back Ribs - The ribs definitely had the most flavor out of all the meats. This surprised me because they looked to be only lightly seasoned. And thank goodness they were as dry as the STL ribs (although certainly not as tender as BBQ should be)! 

Sweet Potato Fries - They were very lightly seasoned with a BBQ rub. So lightly, in fact, they needed either salt or sauce. But they had a nice texture and I can never say no to sweet potatoes. 

Over all, my problem was high expectations and also the fact that I've had truly amazing BBQ and this simply wasn't it. However, I'm glad I tried it. Now I know what I would and wouldn't get should I ever return."}
{"text":"Best BBQ love the grilled artichoke and rolls takes you back when your folks cooked up some good grub"}
{"text":"Recently went here with my boyfriend for lunch on Saturday and absolutely loved it! Our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly. She explained the smoking process to us along with the three signature sauces. Our favorite sauce ended up being the Memphis style! The pricing is not bad at all either. We ordered a small fried pickle, original pulled pork sandwich and Texas brisket sandwich and everything was under $40. I definitely recommend this place & the fried pickles as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Every experience I've had at Lucille's has been positive and every time we get the opportunity to go back, we are excited to do so!

The mint juleps are delicious and refreshing, the warm bread and honey butter is awesome, the happy hour rib tips are affordable, flavorful, and filling, and the atmosphere (especially at the one at the district) is very cool and laid back.  

If you like good food and a great happy hour, definitely give Lucille's a try!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite barbque in Vegas. I have tried other places but the meat here gets me. Absolutely tender and tasty! Great meal sizes. I always share a plate with someone because it is too much food for me. Prices are fair for what you pay. The service was ok but still left satisfied from
The experience. If you know you are going to this place 2 hours in advance you can call and get a reservation."}
{"text":"This place definitely holds it's own. Great brisket. Nice smoke ring. Three words... Cheesey Jalapeno grits. Yes, it is a chain but so far, dare I say that this is some of the best BBQ I have had the pleasure to eat in the PHX area. The portions are huge too. I had enough leftovers to literally last me for for three more meals. Go check this place out for yourself. Aside from the fact that it looks like you are eating in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" ride or something it is seriously really freakin' good."}
{"text":"Great allergy friendly restaurant! When I called and mentioned I had a dairy allergy, I was immediately transferred to a manager (Travis) who was very allergy aware. He even read the entire ingredient list for their BBQ sauce to me over the phone! When I got there, the waiter even double checked that everything I ordered was safe and made sure the kitchen avoided cross contamination. My only complaint is that they didn't have any safe desserts, but I would still come back here for sure. 

For any other dairy allergy people reading this and wondering what to order, I ordered rib tips as an appetizer, and a BBQ chicken sandwich off the gluten free menu with peanut slaw as my side. No reaction, so nobody was lying to me when saying it was safe!"}
{"text":"If you have health or figure conscience then I would recommend the trip tip salad. It will help your cravings for barbeque but still keeps you on the healthy side. Its delicious."}
{"text":"Ah yes, here I am again writing about a chain restaurant.  However, it ain't bad.  I am a Texan.  My BBQ standards are high.  I have not enjoyed any other BBQ in town (Memphis is nasty) and if I will say okay to this place once in a while, now you will know why!

*Outdoor patio seating: this past Friday we sat outside, in perfect weather, while the Dave Matthews cover band played over yonder.
*Mason jars: we are thirsty people.  Most restaurants won't leave water pitchers on your table, but Lucille's mason jar water glasses are big enough where pitchers are not necessary.
*Biscuits: I never really was a biscuit person growing up, but I sure like these sugary babies, and their refills.
*Enormous portions: Eric R. and I came here prior to a day-long fast for a holiday.  We needed to BE FULL, and we sure were when we left.  Food coma-esque.
*Fairness: We ordered the new dinner for 2.  It came with a half appetizer, half chicken, 2 different sets of 4 pork ribs, and a choice of additional meat, plus 2 sides, plus dessert (yes, it sounds like death).  Well, most people know I do not eat pork.  The waiter checked and said we could sub 1 beef rib for every 2 pork ribs.  That was generous, as one beef rib is bigger than at least 3 pork ribs.  It was a messy, gnawing, lipsmacking good time and required multiple warm wet towels.
*Warning: I am not a big dessert person.  Eric R. magically guessed of the options that I would want the peach pecan bread pudding in bourbon vanilla sauce.  We could not eat more than half of it between the 2 of us.  It was so sweet I am on the road to diabetes already....but it was really, really good.
*Warning #2: Last time I ordered a mint julep and I believe there was only bourbon and no simple syrup.  That may be a good thing to some people."}
{"text":"Omg! This is my new favorite BBQ place!! We decided to tey something different since my family was visiting from Cali. They wanted Famous Daves but I convinced them to try something new. By the end of the meal we were all over stuffed and still licking our fingers. The ribs, steak and drinks were all excellent. The biscuits with the apple butter were to die for. Our waitress was by far the best one in the restaurant or so it seemed. She was so sweet and nice and was goofing around with is as much as we were with her. She had a super good attitude and was always making sure we had what we needed! Can't wait to dine there again."}
{"text":"Finally fried pickles on this side of town I love the location in green valley when I lived over there I went all the time! Im so happy their in red rock.....I was light on my food order I just got the brisket nachos (O.K.) fried pickles!!!!!(these rock!) and the southern fried chicken sandwich (amazing good) .....of course I split that with my hubby.....The service was great our server mariana was awesome ...all n all I hope they stay!"}
{"text":"This location is located in the Red Rock Casino. You can enter and exit either through the casino or from the parking lot. I like the fact that you don't have to walk through the casino to get inside.

Great food as always. Doesn't matter which location you go to, it is always consistently good food. They have a great menu if you enjoy Barbecue.

The Beef Ribs are excellent. The best I can remember eating anywhere. They are meaty and tender and the sauce is amazing.

The BBQ Chicken and the brisket are also excellent. I could go over each item, but I can promise you there is nothing on the menu that will disappoint you. Catfish, burgers, salads, side dishes...etc, all are awesome!!"}
{"text":"This is the location I would have to travel to before they opened up a store in the Red Rock Casino in Summerlin. It was worth the drive out to Henderson though.

It is a cool BBQ restaurant with a southern vibe from the decor to the mason jars you drink from. They have a lounge area with a bar that you can also order food from.

The make the best beef ribs you will ever have. Chicken, beef, and sandwiches are all excellent. Nothing on the menu will disappoint you."}
{"text":"The catfish and shrimp combo I had here was good.  My wife's salad was also good. Watch out for the over-priced barbecue items on the menu.  Also, be advised that if you pay the extra $3.00 for Cornbread, you will get only a small, small portion, not worth the cost. Service was ok but our waiter got our check Mixed up with another couple!"}
{"text":"The food and service was good. Be sure to check further back in the menu for the lesser priced smaller portion options unless you'd really like to take half. Of the serving home at the more expensive price"}
{"text":"I was craving some BBQ and took my mom here.  The menu looked like it had great potential and our mouths watered from the variety of offerings.

The biscuits were a bit heavy, but were tasty.  We split a two-meat combo. It was massive!!  We ordered the beef and the St. Louis ribs.  Both were on the tough side.  I had to ask the server if it was St. Louis or baby back ribs on the plate - because there was hardly any meat on it!  I was told St. Louis, but I swear they tasted like baby backs!

We also didn't care for the mashed sweet potatoes - it tasted like baby food.  We did order the apple pie and it was generous and tasted good.  Overall, it looks like it's great for gorups, has big food and drink servings, but fell short in taste and authenticity.  If I were to choose to go to a BBQ  restaurant chain, I would go to a Tony Roma's."}
{"text":"Phenomenal smoked baby back ribs, burnt ends (wasn't aware what it is but couldn't stop till I finish the plate), cold craft beer and a casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great BBQ! For someone who is gluten and dairy free, it's always a dream to find a place that accommodates both! Wait staff is always overly friendly and kind."}
{"text":"Went to Lucille's for a pre-mother's day lunch celebration. Our server, Wendy was on top of things. My ice tea never ran out and she was checking in constantly to see if there is anything else that we need. Amazing service!  The server alone deserves a 5 star and the restaurant too of course."}
{"text":"Really love the fact they have beef ribs! Bad news, they are not edable. Sickeningly sweet with zero Smokey bbq flavor. There is no balance here at all. If I want candied meat, I'll pick up Chinese meat jerky. This is not bbq! After 1 rib, just had to dump the rest. Clearly designed to get junior to eat his meal, by candy coating it. Not giving 1 star since the collards were decent and the baked beans had good flavor."}
{"text":"There are so many up and coming BBQ joints, but a lot of them are just not convenient to drive to. Lucille's is in a great location, which is what drives my family to eat here. It's right next to Costco, Best Buy, Downtown Summerlin and the movies! So for us, it's the location that gets us. 

Not only is the location prime, but the food quality and service is great! It's a great place to have bigger parties gather because of the space and portions! We went around 4pm on a Sunday afternoon and there were larger parties already seated, but we were seated quite quickly. 

Our waiter, Michael, was excellent! Though he was swamped with a larger party in the back of the restaurant he did an excellent job managing our table and needs. The service was great especially for the amount of people there. 

The food was like usual, great! We ordered the onion strings for an appetizer and let me tell you, it defeated us! We were 6 hungry people but geez the portion was huge! We also order tons of ribs and chicken -- let's just say Lucille's took this one and we admitted defeat. Lots of to go boxes were necessary! Especially with those warm biscuits served up with the apple butter! You just can't get enough!"}
{"text":"I love Lucille's and frequented their multiple locations back in California.  My first visit to their Arizona location occurred last night and it was awful.  The primary issue was related to our incompetent server, Lamont.  After being seated by the host, our server did not great us until 5 minutes had passed.  Finally Lamont greeted us and apologized for being late to stop by and we would soon learn that this was about the theme of the entire night.  We placed a drink order, which included a draft beer and a cocktail.  Unfortunately 10 minutes passed before Lamont returned with our drinks.  Keep in mind that the store appeared to have steady business but was not overly busy especially given that it was a Monday night.  When Lamont dropped our drinks we ordered right away fearing that not doing so would result in another disappearing act by our server.  We ordered a Backyard Feast for 2 which comes with a salad or appetizer selection, chicken, meats, 2 sides, and desert.  We ordered salads to start and were asked if we wanted their biscuits as well.  Of course the biscuits are great here.  We waited a full 15 minutes before Lamont showed up with our salads and no biscuits.  Again he apologizes with a smirk which we learn is his way of dismissing the situation.  At this point we were concerned that the main course would arrive without having the chance to finish the salads.  As predicted, we were maybe 3 bites in when our food arrived from the food runner.  Now we're feeling annoyed, rushed and regretting our decision to stop in.  Lamont after some additional time decides to stop by to check on us and apologizes again which is just infuriating us further.  We also had to ask him for the biscuits which he acknowledged with an annoyed lisp.  In the end we ended wasting 2 hours of our life on the worst serving experience we've had in a long time.  Very sad because we like Lucille's and drove 45 minutes to this location."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Pretty good bbq. It's better than Famous Dave's. We had made it in for happy hour on a Monday. Drink specials were decent. We ordered the fried okra as our app which was pretty good (but what doesn't taste good fried!?). We ordered the backyard platter, pulled beef & portobello sandwich and a rack of ribs. The chicken that came in the platter was really moist and good and everyone was pretty happy with their meals (btw their sweet potato fries are pretty good). Service was okay considering how busy they were."}
{"text":"Just had lunch today and the staff appeared friendly  Which was inviting   Looked pretty dead which kinda worried me  But ate there anyways  Was greeted with smiles  and was sat down I guess our server was busy cause  ( i think ) Our host took our drink order and told that server would be with us  Our server ( Gary  I think ) was nice and attentive Had the chicken and gumbo both were pretty good The other items seemed a bit pricey but i guess barbecue isn't really that cheap i thought the portions were decent but really didn't see any other dish portion So really can't help you there I will be back and try something different next time"}
{"text":"Lucille's, I really wanted to like you! I looked at your menu and my mouth watered at all the Southern style favorites you served, such as jambalaya, pulled pork, po' boys, fried okra, and gumbo. However, while I did enjoy a few items here, my experience wasn't too great overall.

We came here on a weekend for a late dinner, and were seated promptly. There are various non alcoholic and alcoholic drinks to choose from, including a few varieties of iced tea and lemonade. I chose the watermelon iced tea ($2.99). It came served in a tall mason jar, with a large wedge of fresh watermelon in the drink. It was quite refreshing with great tea and watermelon flavor. Along with the drinks, we received a basket of sweet butter with light, buttery biscuits (Free, unlimited refills).

As for appetizers, we opted for the fried okra ($3.99 half portion). It was quite a large portion, with a light, crispy breaded outer layer. The okra itself tasted tender, with not a lot of the \"slimy\" texture okra can get. It was served with a spicy ranch and creole mustard sauce. Out of the two, I preferred the mustard better. It was made with whole mustard seeds and its flavor and consistency complimented the breaded, fried, okra better than the thinner, more one-dimensional flavor of the ranch.

I opted for the catfish po' boy sandwich ($11.99), and tried some of the pulled pork sandwich ($10.99). The catfish po' boy looked amazing! It was a huge portion of French bread with large, battered catfish nuggets, mayo with capers, tomatoes, and lettuce. However, the sandwich itself had some problems. The bread was really dry and tasted slightly old, and one of the catfish nuggets was still slightly raw. Setting that undercooked catfish nugget aside, I continued eating the rest of the sandwich, to find an unusual hard chunk while chewing. That hard chunk turned out to be a piece of fish bone stuck in one of the nuggets! 

I had the braised greens as a side, which had a nice smokey flavor with very soft, tender greens from cooking \"low and slow.\" However, as I ate more, I got bits of grit while eating, meaning that they didn't rinse the greens enough before cooking them.

The pulled pork sandwich was better, but not particularly remarkable. I did enjoy the array of bbq sauces on the table to add to the sandwich though.

Prices for me, seem a bit high. They do have a nice looking happy hour and reverse happy hour at the bar every day, offering discounted drinks and appetizers which I might be tempted to try out some day. For now though, I'll be a bit hesitant to try more sandwiches and entrees from Lucille's."}
{"text":"Third time is a charm...one bad review and one good review. With a friend in town, we decided to go for BBQ. I have been to Lucille's a couple of times. The last time was descent so it seemed like a good option. Tie-breaker indicates the first review (negative) may be the more accurate. Again the food was good (but my friend wasn't happy with the gravy slathered all over the chicken. The issues with slow and incorrect service remained.  It took a while to get drinks, refills were slow and incorrect. Several people came in after us and left before us. Dessert was so slow we had to cancel it. They must make each cobbler from scratch as ordered because 15 minutes later we still had no pie. An additional displeasure is the restaurant is very loud - especially on the patio. It is hard to hear others at the same table due to the noise. Two hours for a Friday lunch for three is a bit ridiculous!"}
{"text":"The service is excellent. We had the BBQ sandwich and a Cajon Chicken sandwich, with sides of garlic mashed potatoes and grits with cheese. The sandwiches were awesome, as well as, the mashed potatoes, however, the grits were not good. The atmosphere was very relaxing, the outside porch had the feel of an old Florida plantation home. We will return to eat here."}
{"text":"Rebekah from customer service contacted us and was very apologetic.  Nice to see a company that cares about its customers,  thank for for your concern."}
{"text":"Third time at this location and have been to the Henderson location once. Both are almost identical.  I love the decor and design here.  They're going for that southern bbq look and it's warm and inviting. Bar area with huge tvs everywhere is really nice.  Service is attentive.  Neve have to ask for anything.  Gotta love that sweet tea! I love the big Mason jars the drinks are served in. Had a Moscow mule first and it was on point.  I always order the same thing; full rack of baby backs, fully loaded baked potato,  and Mac and cheese. And of course it's always tasty and delicious.  5 stars for everyone!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the best BBQ in Vegas, this is it. It beats out Pot Liquor, Rollin Smoke, Famous Dave's, Road Kill Grill, and Dickeys.

The ribs are to die for. The brisket is inconsistent, but when it's good, it's the best I've ever had. Even when it's not their best, it's still better than the other places in town. Their sides are always good, whether veggies, beans, succotash (OMG the succotash!), mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries, and also the best coleslaw in Vegas, not my favorite of all time, but the best in Vegas. Both the peach and strawberry lemonades are made with fresh fruit purée and are so thirst quenching and deelicious!! This place only lacks at making BBQ sauce. Sonny's Sweet and maybe even Sweet Baby Ray's is better. Sometimes we get food to go and put our own sauce on at home. That being said, their MOP SAUCE is killer! I always order mop sauce on the side. With the mop sauce, I don't even think about their BBQ sauces.

The portobello cheese brisket sandwich is also really good if you're not in the mood for a meat plate."}
{"text":"Oh Lucille. Why do you always disappoint?

I went to Lucille's a couple of times a few years ago. I think it was pretty good the first time. The second time, for some reason, I left with a negative feeling. I remember paying $20 for hardly any food. On the other hand, my coworker paid much less and had way more food.

Anyway, that experience caused me to avoid the place for several years. I finally went back a couple of weeks ago. This time, we all ordered the same thing - the Smoked Beef Brisket & Portabello Sandwich from the lunch menu. This time around, the price was right ($8.95) and the sandwich was delicious and satisfying. The problem now was that the service was incredibly slow. I'm going to chalk it up to being the last week of the year. Fortunately, the company I was with made it not seem that bad, but even the people I was with mentioned how slow it was.

Overall, I think Lucille's is A-OK. It's never been somewhere that pops in my mind as a choice I would make. But at least now, if someone wants to go there, I'm not against it."}
{"text":"Lucille's is one of the best places in Henderson.  Pulled pork sandwich is my go-to dish.  Add some iced tea and some of that apple butter on a biscuit & I'm stuffed!  Good portion sizes.  If you order the full slab of ribs, you will spend some dough, but all this BBQ is really good.  Worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sit down restaurant with so many seating options... You and a large party of family could enjoy any of the tables or booths inside.. There are tables or high top booth tables by the bar, and my favorite \"the back porch\"... and that's just what it feels like.
Lucille's is tucked on the back of The District in Green Valley Ranch in Henderson. It's one of my favorites.
Tonight I ordered the pan seared catfish and it was by far the best catfish I've ever had. The garlic mashed potatoes that were light, and fluffy clearing my palette for that amazing catfish. It was a beautiful large portion of perfectly seasoned fish, laying on a thin layer of a creole mustard sauce. It is also served with a generous portion of  their braised greens;truly mind blowing. Nice big chunks of pork accenting the flavor the greens. It was truly delightful.
Even the caesar salad was exactly as you would hope it would taste like when you order it... (Thank you Jessica.... our gorgeous waitress/server... who recommended it to me.
Kudos... It was delicious...
The hot rolls with make you wanna lick outta of the bowl apple butter, are in the top 10 of comfort foods.. Kinda makes me wanna be sad.. so I can say it's okay to eat a dozen.
My bf ordered the brisket with a double order of cornbread... Oh my joodness... it comes with this clever little stainless steel mini pitcher that was filled with this magic juice that once poured over the brisket, tempted you to get primal and just start tearing at it with your teeth and claws... The cornbread was at least 4x4' of goodness that kept its structure and texture while sitting in the sauce I just described, for at least 3 hours. It was actually impressive. I'm pretty serious about anti-soggy anything. This corn bread was a gorgeous piece of gold.
My favorite part of all dinner is my bloody mary with tanqueray. Their's is probably a personal preferance for someone. I thought it was joke when I asked for more mix to cut down the worshestire... but i believe they use their bbq sauce in it.. It tasted like steak sauce to me and i couldn't drink it., but you might like it.
We sat inside and had the most pleasant time because of our waitress Jessica. She was always quick and knowledgable about anything we wanted to know about. She was very efficient with the way she serves and clears a table. She kept delightful eye contact and had a room brightening smile. She made me wanna hang out and chill. 
We were lucky enough to have a quick encounter with our server Kim who happen to be sisters with our lovely waitress Jessica. Both were beautifully put together with bright eyes and a certain charm that made you wanna come back to their house.
I love Lucille's and I think that you would be shaming yourself to not visit this location. There is also one on the other side of Vegas at Red Rock but I've always gone back to this one... feels like home."}
{"text":"This is a review of their catering - We chose Lucille's BBQ to cater a birthday event this year and they did an amazing job.  You can grab a catering menu at the restaurant or online and then call the catering number to order and schedule your delivery.  

They have many different priced offerings from\" pick up your food\" to \"fully staffed event serving services\".  We chose the \"bring the food and set up\" option and it was perfect.  All the guests raved about the food and we had quite a bit left over.  I would highly recommend their catering department for personal parties, casual wedding or corporate events."}
{"text":"First time I had Lucille's was in CA a couple years back and was so excited when they opened one in AZ. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch during the weekend, I like the fact that they had a lunch menu even during the weekend. They are all Smaller size plates for a cheaper price. I was a little disappointed with their food. I ordered the seafood platter and there was really nothing to it. I felt like the food was overprice for the amount and quality. The service was not bad, they were good, however, I would probably won't comeback or recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First off, the waiters there are really nice.  Our waitress was really busy, but she was really nice and kept us happy even when she wasn't around.

They had a live blues band in the bar.  They sounded pretty good, but the bar is kinda small and then to add a band?!  

I ordered the BBQ brisket salad with sweet tea and it came with biscuits.  Now the biscuits are kinda weird.  They look like a roll, crumble like a muffin, and taste like cake.  I KNOW!  Weird!  (see photos) I was expecting some real homemade southern biscuits.  And the apple butter was cinnamon butter NOT apple butter.  I was all confused, and we only ended up getting one basket (2 biscuits) cause our waitress was so busy and the other staff forgot us.

The salad was descent.  The size of it was huge.  The meat wasn't that tender.  Kinda disappointed with it.  My husband got a burger.  And said it was the best burger he ever had.   

Desert was really good.......chocolate cake.  Yum!

I think its a good place to come with family or spouse.  Prices are normal for a BBQ place.  BUT I like my Tom's BBQ the best!!"}
{"text":"The food and service from Aaron was awesome.  Had the family feast and it is a ton of food and all of it perfect."}
{"text":"I tried Lucille's food for the first time at the Scottsdale culinary festival and was quite impressed with the food. A year or so later, I visited the restaurant at Tempe Marketplace and was not impressed. I waited almost 20 minutes to place an order then waited another 25-30 minutes for the food. I understand restaurants get busy but that's ridiculous. When I returned home, I found that my order was incomplete, I definitely was not driving back to the restaurant.  I ordered the sliders which seemed a bit dry with not much taste. The cornbread and biscuits were okay but that's pretty much it. Considering the cost, the amount of time it took to order and obtain my food and the quality of the food, I will be exploring other restaurants for BBQ."}
{"text":"The only reason this place doesn't get one star is my husband and mom, said their food and I quote \"wasn't terrible\".  My food was terrible, mostly because it was cold.  

When we arrived we were seated quickly, and a waiter came and took our drink orders. Biscuits arrived and they were tasty, we ordered.  This ends the positive points in this experience.  I ordered a baked potato stuffed with pulled pork and a salad on the side.  My salad was soaked in dressing, it was a lot more dressing then salad.  My potato was completely cold the cheese had hardened on top creating a shell holding the cold pulled pork in.  The potato also had 2 large (visible since I didn't eat this cold item) bad spots that went fairly deep into the potato.  When I let the waiter know that my meal was cold he looked at me like I committed a cardinal sin and didn't even hint at an apology.  My mom and husband both got BBQ combos, between the two of them every possible choice was ordered.  Both said food was \"not terrible\" mostly at least it was hot.  I decided to go for a walk around the District instead of watching them eat, since I now had zero interest in trying anything off the menu.  The manager came by and offered a free dessert.  When I came back she walked by twice and didn't once stop to offer an apology.  We were not charged for my meal (since I didn't eat it) but for two lunches ordered off the lunch menu our bill came to $40 which I think is high, especially considering the quality of food. 

Topping off our lunch was the 20 minutes it took from when the waiter was handed our check until when it was brought back.  This is way too long, especially since the restaurant was not even busy.

Will not be back, and do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place used to be excellent when they first opened several years ago. The quality and service have gone way down and the prices have gone way up. Is not a good value at all."}
{"text":"Have been coming to this place on and off for years. For a chain BBQ restaurant it's not bad. Some of the best fried pickles in the area. Brisket is good and ribs and good. Service is outstanding and fun place for a work party or small family gathering."}
{"text":"DO NOT order brisket. Only one word to describe it DRY, DRY and DRY!  We were very, very disappointed with our second visit. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"We decided to try here tonight to try something new! Glad we did! We sat in the bar area to avoid waiting. Service was fast and friendly! The portions were outrageous! Price was more than we usually like to spend but well worth the money."}
{"text":"Oh man! Lucille's is one of the best places to eat great bbq! It is so delicious and falls right off the bone and melts in your mouth! The staff is wonderful and of course, like I said, the food is great! Everything on the menu is equally as mouth-watering!"}
{"text":"The service was okay, i couldn't find him when I need some refill on strawberry lemonade. it took them a long time to bring the appetizer out, we had the sampler and after we finished our appetizer we waited another 10-15mins ( on a slow Sunday afternoon) for our entrees. :/"}
{"text":"This place was a heavy favorite when my wife and I lived in Henderson. Even now living in the suburbs of one of the best food cities in the US, I still miss Lucille's. Great atmosphere and really great food. 

I rarely deviated from the pulled pork sandwich, because it's just too good not to get, but the menu has a lot to offer otherwise.

I'd argue that Lucille's is the best restaurant in the District."}
{"text":"They have the BEST baby backs on the planet. I am not a fan of BBQ sauces so I get my ribs \"naked\".  I have never eaten inside the place, I always get my ribs to go"}
{"text":"It was either Lucille's, or C.F. The latter was a much longer wait. So we went outside our box. Severely disappointed. Our other go to BBQ place was a bit out of the way, but we should have gone with that and dealt with the drive. 

Everything at Lucille's, besides the fried green tomato, and the Hop Ride IpA by Tenaya Creek was BLAND. Flavorless wings, bland Mac n cheese, seasonless burnt ends, absolutely NOTHING on the tri-tip sandwich besides meat, and had it not been for the sauce it was drenched in, that would have completely lacked flavor too... I don't understand the high accolades when we couldn't even get our kid's food out on time, much less a water refill. 

Sorry Memphis Championship BBQ. We won't be cheating on you again."}
{"text":"Cool place, wonderful food and excellent staff!. The baked chicken was moist and very tasty! Our server April was awesome... She recommended the fried pickles and they were yummy. So much food we couldn't eat it all. Try the grits they are out of this world.. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Oh we love this place....we've been here so many times and each time it's still just as delicious as the time before.  The Memphis style pulled pork sandwich is amazing and the snickers pie is SO good.  I love the sugary biscuits and cinnamon butter they bring out to the table.  The whole experience here is awesome."}
{"text":"If you're looking for AUTHENTIC Bar-B-Que in the Valley, this is the place to go! I went here with some friends for my birthday and it was amazing. I got a full rack of ribs, a side of mac-n-cheese, and a piece of corn bread. The ribs were fantastic, so full of flavor and moist. The mac-n-cheese was decent but I was expecting more. The corn bread? Great!

The vibe of this place is really cool too. I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night in Red Rock Casino and we were up for Lucille's Barbecue. So were several other people. There would be a 45 minute wait. Thanks to an innovative yet obvious system the 45 minutes would be put to good use. After the host informed us of the wait, he asked for the cell phone number. When our table was ready, he would send a text message. Lucille's just happens to be Red Rock Casino neighbors with the Yard House, an indoor theme park of beer. And when I drink a beer in the yard House, 45 minutes flies by fast and before I knew it, Lucille's Barbecue sent the text.

  I had my mind set on ordering some type of hamburger sandwich. From past experiences dining in restaurants specializing in barbecue cuisine, the hamburgers are exceptional (same holds true with steak houses). After a cursory glance at the menu, the smoked beef brisket & portabello sandwich struck my eyes. I am a fan of brisket and mushrooms. After the waiter said this is one of their best sandwiches, I ordered it. Color me impressed with the sandwich. Everything from the grilled red onions to the sourdough bread was quality. The space between the sourdough buns was thick with the smoked beef brisket. Delicious smoked beef brisket that is. I appreciated that it wasn't sticky. With the sandwich, I chose shoestring fries. They were decent. And the soda that I drank was in a large glass. 

  Attentive and for the most part friendly servers placed the food on the table. One of the servers was attentive enough to let us know that the bread rolls were taking awhile because they were making new ones. Toward the end of the meal, one of the servers took the initiative to give us a to-go box. My one beef with the service was having to wait on ketchup. 

  I am impressed with Lucille's Barbecue. Especially,  when a 45 minute wait is no wait, but the freedom to have a beer in the Yard House or walk around Red Rock Casino until a text message sends the alert that the table is ready. I could see a return dinner to Lucille's Barbecue in my future."}
{"text":"Been here a few times because our kids enjoy ribs and don't complain when we say we will go Lucille's!  We went this week and asked for Kris as our server since she helped us the last time and was so patient and friendly with our 3 kids.  This time was no different than the last time, she was super friendly and attentive.  We usually get ribs and a pasta dish but this time we just ordered 2 racks of ribs with mac n cheese, veges, and corn on the cobb.  Ribs and Mac n Cheese were excellent.  I didn't try the other sides but my husband said they were good.  We ordered an appetizer that isn't on the menu, its the potato chips but we have them make them like nachos, they are so yummy!  Do your self a favor and ask them for that next time you go in.  Overall a great family place to eat and huge selection of things to pic from."}
{"text":"came here because this was the closest place to watch the Warriors game! And of course being from the Bay Area we had to watch it!  Our server was great. So sweet and helpful when it came to us ordering drinks!  We even let her know we would be here a while because of the game. 

We ordered the pulled pork queso dip, the fried pickles and the backyard lemon aid.  We loved the dip. It was a bit spicy and didn't expect that. But nothing that the drink couldn't wash down. 
The fried pickles wernt our favorite. We thought they were pickle chips. They're pickle spears, which the breading fell off when you took a bite. Oh well. 

Overall the customer service was amazing here. The manager even informed us the Warriors game would be on every tv in the bar. I would say I'd come back here again but I don't plan on coming back to Henderson unfortunately. I was just out here for a business event. But I do reccomend coming here!!"}
{"text":"I can truly say that after meeting Lucille, my life has improved significantly.  Every time I'm in Vegas I look forward to eating at Lucille's.  The food here is amazing and some of the best BBQ I have ever had.  The atmosphere is great for business and family lunches and dinners.  Just tonight the waiter went above and beyond and sugared the top of the jar that my strawberry lemonade was in to make it all the better.  

I get the Porch Combo most of the time with the baby backs and the tri-tip and also really love the rolls and butter they bring out.  This place is MONEY!"}
{"text":"This is the candy of all barbque. I mean this is insanely good. It's on the pricey side, but everything on my plate was to die for. Even after eating all the meat of the bone I could naw on that thing for hours! 

If I ever come back to Vegas I'm coming here again. This is the best barbque yet. 

The back of the restaurant towards the casino is super cute and unique. I think it's a better place to sit than by the bar."}
{"text":"Okay, let me be honest, I'm biased in favor of Texas Style BBQ - dry rub before being smoked and sauce always on the side, with sauce that is tomato and vinegar based, on the spicy side. Lucille's, while a well run establishment is more towards the the perspective of BBQ coming with sauce on it (even when i asked for the dry as a bone option on a beef rib it had been sauced and then grilled - good but certainly not \"dry\" BBQ). In addition, all the sauces seemed to be on the sweet side..

I will says the service was generally good and the watermelon ice tea, if nothing else I would stop in for a glass of that on a hot day, if I was in the area. In addition, this place is more of a BBQ as a specialty item with a price to match (they seem to charge on the high side), and I'm more in favor of hole in the wall joints like Little Miss BBQ down on University towards 32nd street. 

One other thing that was exceptional was the hot link sausage - well grilled and more of the beef with black pepper flavor that epitomizes the BBQ sausage in Texas with its strong German roots. 

Look, my view here is based on my personal tastes and I bet there are some people who will find this their complete cup of tea - if you like \"wet BBQ\" with a sweet sauce, and better yet, mustard based, this place is for you and I encourage you to get your own perspective. if nothing else a unique place to eat in the marketplace that seems to have a bit more authenticity than your average chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The service and side dishes is subpar but that's not what you came for: you came for meat. And that stuff is great."}
{"text":"The outside appearance of Lucille's is certainly appealing and we love BBQ.  Thus, our decision for a late lunch.  The place had a few full tables but it definitely was not very busy at all.  We were promptly seated but waited what seemed like forever for a waiter to appear for our drink orders.   Then, it took forever again until he showed up for our order.  We were just getting ready to leave money for the drinks on the table when he finally strolled over.  Needless to say .... service was awful.

We love barbecue.  Since we lived in Texas for many years, we know what Texas barbecue is.  It's not Lucille's barbecue.  My husband ordered the Texas BBQ sandwich.  It was too spicy.  He didn't eat it.  I had the 1/4 BBQ chicken and baby back ribs luncheon special.  It must have been an awful small chicken.  The chicken wasn't thoroughly cooked and the ribs weren't cooked long enough to come off the bone.  You would normally think a waiter would ask how you liked the meal especially when the plates are taken back nearly full --- not so.  

If you want better barbecue, I would suggest a trip across the parking lot to Dave's or to Joe's BBQ.  Hands down those two places are not only better but they are a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"Food was accurate and ready when I arrived.  Waited for a few minutes for the takeout person to notice me. But overall much better visit than last time"}
{"text":"Well, I've been sitting here for 45 minutes since ordering food, and 10 minutes since ordering a drink. Haven't seen my server in 10 minutes, and then the manager tells us that their smoker is malfunctioning and that thats what has been taking so long. Having not communicated to us that there was an issue. Smokers smoke meat before the restaurant opens, not to-order. Would be nice if managers didn't insult your intelligence to cover their own tails.......AND theres a hair in my food now. Smothered in barbecue sauce. Not coming back HERE again....

Burnt ends were good though."}
{"text":"We went  to Lucille's for lunch last weekend and overall it was pretty good. The biscuits and apple butter are not bad. Personally I would like to see them served with real apple butter but that's just a texture thing for me. We had a small order of wings with the mustard based BBQ sauce (can't remember the name) and they were REALLY tasty. The wings were still crunchy and the sauce was surprising in the best way. 

I had the fried catfish...it was just ok. Too much batter and the fish and batter both needed salt. The portions are massive so I think if we go back we will most likely split something.  

The staff was very attentive and friendly. The manager was a little surly but maybe she was having a bad day. 

All in all - a good time was had by all!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times never had a bad meal.  I got the two meat combo......ribs and brisket......food was very good.  It was 30 bucks but I thought what the heck it should be good.   The portion size was way to small for 30 buck!  I love the food here but I think it's now just a lunch spot for is."}
{"text":"I'm hooked to Lucille's. Good GOD! 

Those biscuits and apple butter they bring out before your food...I could fill up on just those! We've tried their chili, shrimp, pulled pork sandwich, cajun chicken sandwich, and some great drinks like their Strawberry Lemonade (alcoholic of course) and Mojitos. 

We've had great service every time, and I love the ambiance of the place.
I've never been disappointed and keep thinking of when we can go back next!!"}
{"text":"My first visit here was amazing, great service & great food. Came here for lunch today, and the service was so so and the food was pretty bland. I'm assuming dinner time is the best time to dine here."}
{"text":"We were disappointed with our experience for the prices that are charged although I must say the service was awesome.  Our server Simone was wonderful.  The food was mediocre at best.  They cheesy grits were not cheesy.   The mac and cheese had no flavor.  The kids grilled cheese was soggy.  The fried chicken was overdone.  The kids pasta and the french fries were good, but that's not enough for me to find my way back to this establishment."}
{"text":"We liked Lucille's so much we went there twice!  Loaded with personality, and I'm talking about the atmosphere and the staff in this Cajun/Creole influenced establishment when I say that, this place had an ambiance as welcoming a lemonade with your best friend on the screen porch during a warm summer night. It was a fun place to take the kids. Both times we went there was live music and all seemed entertained when our little ones decided to groove to it right next to our table. The smoked chicken was delicious, the onion straws were sinful and the ribs were out of this world! Even the sides were incredible --- my mouth is watering thinking about the garlic mashed potatoes.  Reasonable prices for what you get.  Pretty good kids menu.  Great people watching.  Call ahead to reserve a table, the place is popular and you will wait if you don't.

{"text":"Don't think my rating has changed since the first time I reviewed. I've been here twice since then, once for a birthday and the other for a date with an old friend of mine. 

On this last time, I had the tri tip sandwich, and the two of us shared some fried pickles and spinach and cheese dip. We also each got a Hurricane, as suggested by our waitress, and ended the night with banana pudding and bread pudding. 

Phew! So I had always wanted to try their tri-tip, but never wanting to be up for something messy I got it that night. After putting some bbq sauce on it, it was super tasty! My friend got the brisket, which he had to put half away when he first got it since it was so good and he wanted to take some home. The apps were also good, but I'd never had spin dip without artichokes, so I thought it was lacking. 

Hurricanes - very good. Didn't realize we didn't get happy hour prices until we got the bill (we weren't seated at the bar), but it was well worth it. 

And our deserts were tasty as well, though I think the small bread pudding was not very much for the price."}
{"text":"Ok food and atmosphere, but a bit overpriced.  I've had better, authentic, \"Bar-B-Que,\" at a hole in the wall place for half the price.  

Pro: Their menu offers a lot of different things.  Not just bar-b-que.
Convenient if you're planning to be in the District at Green Valley.
It seems that the atmosphere is what you're paying for.

Con: Overpriced.  I don't mind paying for good food.  But it seems mediocre.  
Ex: $5 lemonade."}
{"text":"Our go to for BBQ. Doesn't disappoint. My husband and I did the lunch special which is available from 11am-4pm and got the 3 meat combo. I got the baby back ribs (a must anytime I'm there!), burnt ends, smoked bbq sausage, and Mac and cheese, hubby got Baby back ribs, brisket, hot link and beans. $17.99 per person for all that food was a steal in my opinion. We also ordered onion straws (my personal fav) and of course the biscuit and apple butter were great as usual. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Took me forever to try this place ! I go to redrock often to gamble, not so much to eat. I had to get an iPhone fixed, instead of finding food in downtown Summerlin , my boyfriend and I chose to go to Lucille's. 

I see a lot of reviews on the host/greeter. There were two people upfront, I think one was in training. Not very smiley, but they sat us immediately. 

I love the design of the restaurant! It's like you're sitting outside, there's fake tress and the kitchen looks like a restaurant and what not. They smoke the meat inside ! 

Our server Anthony, was nice. He took care of us, nothing too special. He answered some of my questions and wasn't rude about it. 

First we ordered our drinks which were an IPA beer and I ordered a blue bayou, which was a coconut tequila, 1800 reposado,  blue and blackberries, margarita type drink. When you order the Blue Bayou, a dollar supports the cause for autism. The drink was DELICIOUS. When we got our drinks, he also brought out some biscuits, I believe ? It was so delicious! It wasn't as moist. But it was still good. They also had some kind of whipped apple cinnamon butter ? I don't know what it was, but it was tasty. It's sweet, so I ended up eating it last, as a dessert. Kind of wish I had more . 

My boyfriend has ordered babyback rib lunch with collard greens, and I ordered 2 meat combo, which was burnt tips, pulled pork and Mac n cheese. The rib and the tips were bomb !!!! The pulled pork, not so much.. I find it kind of dry. Mac n cheese is normal, but the collared greens were yuck. It was so mushy. It reminded me of an Asian vinegar veggie dish that sat in a pot for a long time, so it became mush. I was a little disappointed. 

Up side , they have 3 sauces on the table! I love sauce, so I put hot sauce into the greens. It tastes a little better. 

Another thing, I posted a pic of my dish.. I know bbq food isn't really \"pretty\", but my plate looked like I got it from a cafeteria . It looked like someone scooped the meat. It's all in the middle, I had so much space on my plate, the presentation isn't as nice like other bbq joints. 

Prices are reasonable. 2 dishes(15.99&10.99) , 2 drinks(can't remember the prices), for lunch we spent about 48$ not including tip. 

We also got a deal since it's autism awareness month, if you donate 5$ you get 10$ to use on your next visit (may-June only). So we opted to do that, good to donate from time to time.

Definitely going to come back for the baby back and rib tips! Not so much the greens."}
{"text":"Had Lucille's BBQ for the first time tonight and I was disappointed. I think it was overpriced and the service was bad for the big party we had. 20+ people tonight and one server. Any other place we'd get 2-3 servers(famous Daves, Bobby Q). The food wasn't bad but I've had better and cheaper. Don't think I'll be going back there anytime soon. Oh yeah briskets shouldn't be so tough. It doesn't fall apart in your hand or your mouth. Be ready to chew like your life depended on it."}
{"text":"I've been to Lucille's about a half dozen times now.  I will never go back.  The ribs were dry, tough and barely edible.  The brisket dry and tough.  It was like the food had been under a warming lamp for hours.  The service was mediocre at best.  When we complained to the manager, she couldn't have cared less.  On the positive side, the beer was cold, at least."}
{"text":"The only thing stopping me from giving Lucille's five stars, is my love for Bobby Qs, but that's for another review.  Lucille's is hidden away in the back lot of Tempe Marketplace but that has not in the least hindered their business.

What we got: Fried pickles, they came in wedges not slices and it was phenomenal except for the bit where the juice from the pickle will burn your mouth if you're not careful.  I wasn't too impressed by their wings and probably wouldn't be getting them again.  For our entrées, we had 1) salad, which seemed nothing out of the ordinary.  2) A full rack of baby back ribs, dont even bother getting half a rack cause its never worth it. It comes with two sides and I was impressed that they give you an entire ear of corn instead of a third of one.  But I may be biased but Bobby Q's ribs are better, sorry Lucille.  3) The tri-tip sandwich was pretty damn amazing, though I was a little disappointed that it was on a regular burger bun especially after I saw the dressed up steak sandwich.  4) The steak sandwich was great in what I think was ciabatta and covered in arugula.

For me, what bumps them up from a 3 star to 4 star joint, is their service.  They had made a mistake with the steak sandwich and slathered mayo on both sides of the bread though we explicitly told them not to.  But when we brought it up to them, they immediately offered to replace it, took it off our bill, and to top that off, dessert was on the house.  We took up their offer and got the apple beignets which had too little apple for my liking but was a treat nonetheless.

All in all, amazing experience and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Thank you Megan for making our experience amazing!! The food was great and the service here was even better!! 

I would definitely come back again to try a full rack next time!"}
{"text":"Omg me and my girlfriend went here and it was absolutely gross!! Neither of us finished our meals under cooked under seasoned etc just horrible I will never return here. Also our waiter act like he had never looked at the menu before very rude & unknowledable"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of the Henderson location was extremely excited to have one a lot closer.

The Good:

Service was decent
Chicken wings & onion rings were very good
Side salad was decent

The Bad:

We ordered a full rack of St. Louis Spare Ribs. They appeared tasty we each cut a few off and took a few bites. Something was just not right. The best way I can explain the taste is if you were to dump a ton of lighter fluid over a charcoal grill and use it immediately after. We spoke with the manager and she agreed to bring another rack of ribs. This time baby rack - Maybe it was just a single occurrence? They had the same exact flavor. Something is broken. They confirmed something was not right. Not sure how everyone else was just eating away. They comped the full meal ($15) of sides and we left feeling sick and with a headache. Extremely disappointed. Will give it another shot but not for a while."}
{"text":"I swear, I don't know why people like this place so much. So this is the 4th time I been to a Lucille's. It's always someone else's idea, and never mine. It seems like I always get the overly dry baby back ribs. Grumbling all the way to Lucille's, I ordered the exact same thing as my girl. My incessant griping probably got to her nerves. I went with my rant on how my ribs always turn out dry and the only thing about this place is that they slather the ribs with a crapload of sauce. And then the waiter has the nerve to come and ask us how the ribs are after they give you a plate with enough sauce to drown both you and your dog, provided you went in with a seeing eye dog or something.

No, I don't know what's so great about the food. My ribs came out dry. But I told the waiter and the manager this time. Every time I go to one, I always get the dry one. I gave 3 pieces to my girl and she nodded her head that it was dry compared to hers. So the grumbler wasn't grumbling for the heck of it. But they were nice enough and got me new ones which were not as dry. But it gets pretty old to almost always having to do it when you order your food. You know for a nice BBQ without the wait or pretense, I'd go to Dickey's.

What I do like about Lucille's. Their staff are generally friendly and good. I just don't care for their food that much. The sides are good. My ribs sucked but my mac and cheese was great. As are the freebie rolls. Kind of sad that I like the sides more than the main dish. But if you are going to advertise yourself as smokehouse, inhouse made bbq sauce, etc., I'd expect a modicum of tastiness to the meat.

All in all, my 4th time and I still hate going. Until the next time when I get dragged to this place again for a get together, birthday, or whatever event; I'll get ready to eat more biscuits.


--------------------
Update
-------------------
I received a response from the owner the next day regarding my experience. I must say, I did not expect a response especially since both locations are always busy whenever I go. I am not in a hurry to go back since I am pretty unlucky ordering but my friends like it enough to recommend we meet up here if that's any indication of their food. I give 5 stars to the owner for caring about his customers. If you are as popular and successful as Lucille's and still read a humble reviewer without a 1,000 reviews behind him, then you are A ok in my book."}
{"text":"The buscuits and apple butter were a treat. My favorite is the Marti gras Chicken! !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the service has always been good. The BBQ is really good. I got the tri-tip sandwich, I'd definitely recommend it. The corn bread is delicious. The catfish is very good, very fresh tasting fish. I thought the Mac and cheese to be average."}
{"text":"My daughter and granddaughter went here to celebrate an early birthday dinner for me. I love Lucille's, it was crowded on a Saturday night and we were told it would be an hour wait, but we were called in about 35 minutes. Their biscuits are delicious! The onion strings are a must every time I come here. Our waiter was so nice. We asked him if he could take pictures of us and he gladly said yes, not only did he take the pictures but let us look at them to see if they were ok or he would have taken more! I wish that I could remember his name. This was a 5 star experience for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best barbecue restaurants I've been to. We always leave stuffed. The brisket and pulled pork sandwich are awesome. The dinner rolls at are out of this world as well. Served with a cinnamon butter."}
{"text":"GOOD
1st check out pic of the bbq slow roasting...thought that thing was for show...ha
I love the beef ribs here better than all the other bbq places around the valley...I've tried just about them all.  Quality and always well seasoned, not overly sauced when served and never over cooked.
 Im told the pork are better than the beef...by my roommates... unfortunately, I don't do swine..so gotta take their word for it.
Oooh-wee...the sweet tea is on point and served in huge mason jars...the fried pickles are always a good place to start for apps..artichokes were pretty good as well...could've been a tad bit more done.

BAD
Called ahead for reservations (4 ppl) requested a high chair, as well.  When we were sat the host must have not known we were in a  *fire zone* booth.  Because after apps we requested the chair then we're told we can't have it due to fire code and blocking  walk area?  Well...you sat us hear?? Didn't offer to change tables...weird?

Manager came by later and apologized for inconvenience and removed 20% off bill. Nice but passing an infant back n forth taking turns eating sucks...would've given the service a solid 4 star but the service short fall bummed down to a 3.5..

P.s. Daisy our server was excellent...kudos to Daisy for the great recovery because she handled it well"}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Havent tried everything but I can vouch for the brisket, pulled pork bbq, peach cobbler, and ribs.  Service was above average."}
{"text":"So delish!
Biscuit is soooo good! BBQ ribs excellent,  baby back ribs excellent, chicken excellent , brisket excellent but portion was a little small, the sauce for the artichoke excellent, sides were all good but BOY SWEET POTATO FRIES are amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going I found the food to be mediocre. I was not impress with the quality of the food. It wasn't bad but not great. The desert was only thing I enjoyed. Services was good but the food quality could be improve."}

{"text":"First trip to Lucille's was while we were on a trip to Vegas. Lucille's was close to our hotel in Henderson, so we decided to check it out. First off they have the best strawberry lemonade (only second to Cracker Barrell) I have ever had. My husband and I both got the Trip Tip sandwich, AMAZING! The bbq sauces they have a awesome and the food was great. We will definitely be back to Lucille's, in California though :)"}
{"text":"Brisket nachos were amazing! Came here for a late lunch on vacation. Staff is friendly. Good service. Decent drink menu."}
{"text":"family took me here for dinner and i havent been since i was a kid.  If your looking for some great bbq..if you you love good smoked meat then this a must try!!  Food was orgasmic!!  i got the smoked buffalo chicken wings dipped in franks red hot sauce for a starter...dear lord they were amazing.  For the main plate i got the stack of baby back ribs with sides of garlic mash potatos and corn.  Mother buckers it was heavenly.  I am still full =)"}
{"text":"This place is a really fun trip into southern food and decor. The food is good but not great. It's has that mass produced feel about it. I always leave a little disappointed. It's also very expensive. Definitely worth a visit but you will have a wait a key times."}
{"text":"Two weekend in a row, I have been to Lucille's. First in Woodland Hills and second this location. They get four stars because both times, they have great bar staff. I've come here both times for Happy Hour. 

I'm very skeptical about franchise BBQ spots. But, what stands out to me about both places is the flavor of Gumbo. The people I was with also enjoyed the Gumbo. I can only imagine if they had crab in it. 

However, the burnt ends, was a major fail. Wasn't burnt and all Fat. Not much flavor to it. The deviled eggs were just okay. 

So, I was told there's a Lucille's in Concord, Ca which is about a 30 min drive from me, I will try their actual menu there. Also found out the story of Lucille is actually made up."}
{"text":"So disappointing!!! Sevice was awful!! Staff lunch and we all got out lunch expect one 20 minutes later Deb one of the managers by or are we missing one!!! Really the server never cane back when she noticed her food was missing! Last time we come back as a group or individually they just lost 7 customers plus families..."}
{"text":"I HEART LUCILLE'S the bar b que is the BUSINESS and I love the sides! my favorite place for catfish, hands down! We dined there last night for dinner, i cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Lucille's is a nice clean BBQ restaurant.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast.

I went there yesterday for the first and last time.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly, but was in that too friendly mode.  I don't know if you know what I am talking about, but it seemed like he was so overly friendly that it was insincere.  And he was one of those type of waiters who was there every 5 minutes at the start of the meal, and no where near at the end of the meal.

We started our meal with their signature biscuits.  We are in AZ so I am sure the cooks do not really now how to cook a good biscuit.  Our nice flakey biscuit was hard and crunchy on the outside, and warm and not flakey on the inside.  The honey butter was marginal.

The onion straw appetizer was good, the best part of the meal.

I had a baby back rib combo with hot links and my friend had the chicken and rib lunch combo.  Same kind of ribs.  The ribs were dry and not very tender.  She said her chicken was good, and my sausage was cooked fine.  No real flavor to the sausage, just spicy.

Overall, as BBQ joints go, I wont be back.  Its hard to create the hole in the wall BBQ joint with a chain, and Lucille's has not done it."}
{"text":"We had high expectations for Lucille's and were not disappointed. The food was excellent and the meat is smoked deliciously. We had the Saint Louis ribs and fried pickles for an appetizer. Both were delicious!! The only complaint is that the wait seemed a little long with several open tables and once we were seated it took a little while before the waiter came to us. The Southern hospitality however was on point and the staff couldn't be friendlier. They accommodated moving us when we got cold inside with ease. Overall, I was very impressed and will definitely be back, I will just make sure I have time to spare and am ready to relax with some great food."}
{"text":"Great service. Food tasted great. We had the beef ribs and Four Alarm Burger. I wanted to manage the spiciness of the burger so they were kind enough to out the roasted jalapenos on the side. Their biscuits and apple butter was great."}
{"text":"For starters, I'm visiting the Phoenix area all the way from Kansas City, Missouri (the headquarters of all things barbecue), and this place totally rocks! I am impressed by the polite, caring staff as well as the super tasty food! Totally glad I stopped by here while on vacation, it was well worth it! 

Highly recommended, especially, of course, if you're a fan of barbecue. 5 stars!

P.S. You're offered a warm, dampened towel once finished with the food to clean up. Just a nice little detail I thought I'd mention."}
{"text":"Some of my Favorite Ribs anywhere !!! different rib options, sauces, and sides. come hungry !!!! great ambiance, and pretty good service ! and only 20 minutes from the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"If the amazing smells don't keep you coming back, the food defines will. I love coming here. The smells and atmosphere combine to give you a great experience while you wait for your meal. The biscuits you get are fantastic and have just the right amount of sweetness to them. The portions you get when ordering are enormous and always leave you needing a to go box. The food is so good I attempt to eat it all but fail, thankfully the food is good as leftovers as well. I am so glad I found this location as it is closer to my house. I completely forgot it was here though. I don't recall any kind of advertising and the signs for it are fairly small. Red Rock casino has great food options and they seem to be under promoted. Now that I know this is here, I will be going back a little more often!"}
{"text":"My last day of my weekend so we decided to go to Red Rock for a movie and lunch date. 

The setting of this space is LARGE very much so filled with American nostalgia. 

Music is good. Service is awesome. Food was BBQ to its core.

They have complementary biscuits, generous drink sizes and even warm wet towels to wipe of the mess of food you ate.

Good choice if you like burgers and BBQ"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great. To start, we ordered the appetizer platter. The fries pickles were different from what I'm used to, but I really liked them. Pretty much everything was fried but I didn't get that nasty \"ugh I are fried crap\" feeling later which is cool. I had the beef brisket, mac and cheese, and baked beans. All were delicious. I also tried the chicken and the ribs -- also super good. The service was on par, beer list was commendable, and the atmosphere fun. My only complaint is no room for dessert."}
{"text":"I seriously need to stay away from this place.  They are really making it difficult to go back to being a vegetarian.  The food is beyond delicious. The staff is amazing! They even know how to prepare fish/seafood well.   Go figure.  FYI not a good place to go if your worried about calories."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite place to get beef ribs in the world! They have excellent greens and chicken but I haven't found a place anywhere that can compete with the amazing taste of their beef ribs! 

This location also has a very cool design inside that makes you feel line you're dining outside. 

P.S. They also have some well placed seating adjacent to their bar area for good sports watching."}
{"text":"Don't bother, save your money and spend it elsewhere. The bread was disgusting, dry, and devoid of flavor, the \"apple butter\" tasted more like cinnamon paste, the meat was dry, and the BBQ sauce tasted like they bought the Masterpiece brand at the store."}
{"text":"Food is great. I've tried my fair share of items from the menu and never have been disappointed. I bring my coworkers from out of state as there is a great variety of options for everyone. Free biscuits and apple butter. Huge portions. Even with lunch portions I always have a ton of left overs."}
{"text":"Had dinner with my family at Lucille's on April 26, 2018, and the food was not good.  My catfish was hot and I couldn't eat it.  I told the waiter about this.  He left and brought another man to the table about the fish.  He said he would replace the fish.  He reached in my plate, bare hand and got fish.  I shrimp was not good either.  I didn't not say nothing about the shrimp.  They did bring another piece of fish that was alright but my appetite was gone.  I contact them on their website and never got any response."}
{"text":"Food was great as always! Had the BEST service by our server Katie, who goes by Katelyn. We had one issue and the service recovery that we received by Katie and her manager was absoutley fantastic it could not have been better. Katie went absoutley above and beyond. We'll definitely be back because of her!"}
{"text":"***PROS***
* Smells great!
* Plenty of seating
* Nice atmosphere
* Draft beers
* 3 types of BBQ sauce on your table
***CONS***
* It never quite tastes as good as it smells
* The pulled-pork sandwich has a rub, not sauce
* The shoestring fries were really narrow, like toothpick fries

All in all, we are pleased with lunch. This is our 3rd visit to Lucille's."}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ I have had in Vegas. Great service, clean and friendly. Their side items are YUM-O! 

You get large portions for anything you order and they have drink specials. Great place for casual dining or you can get fancy here. Definitely more upscale than other BBQ spots."}
{"text":"We enjoy the Lucille's in Henderson way better.  It's funny how the same joint can prepare food differently.  The taste, presentation, service, and portions are a little lacking from the Henderson spot.  Nevertheless, if you are in the mood for some BBQ, this is a solid 3 star.  The sauces are a thumbs down."}
{"text":"Came in pre-movie to have some food and drinks... We were seated very quickly and our server took our drink order... I ordered the special tequila drink and I can't remember then name. :(
However it is very yummy, it is basically a margarita with some beer on the top... No not a beerita, it has some \"shock\" name... 
It is yummy
I think Southern Shock or Texas shock idk

For food I chose the original pork BBQ sandwich.. My sandwich is perfect, the meat is nice and tender with some juices. The Mac and cheese is on point

I love love love the huge mason jars, I secretly wanted to steal one but couldn't haha

The interior of Lucille's is very different, major southern
It is a big house all around and has a cute patio section, it would be perfect for summer nights"}
{"text":"Great food. Good sized portions. You can get most of the appetizers in a half size. Fried pickles are the best. Peach lemonade  is too good. Ask for a to go lemonade...it's huge and great for these hot Vegas days."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.  Lucille's is delicious. Beware though - the portions are huge!! This is no exaggeration. The first time my husband and I went there we ordered our own entrees, each coming with 2 sides. We had plans to get drinks after dinner, BUT we barely made it home before we immediately slipped away into food comas.

We've since learned our lesson. Recently we ordered carry out (yes, they offer carry out!) and this time ordered one entree (a rack of ribs) with 2 sides of course (sweet potatoes - they gave us mashed and fries! and greens). We both ate until we were full and still didn't finish it all. 

The restaurant itself has a nice lay out with several different dining areas, including a traditional dining room, bar/ lounge, porch tables, and a covered outdoor space. It actually feels like you're dining in someone's home no matter where you are seated. This is the best place for BBQ in Vegas I've tried so far!"}
{"text":"First time here, this place is great! The server was very personable, we had biscuits and the buffalo chips for appetizers, both were great. The biscuits were served with Apple butter which I love. The meats were cooked very well, much better than other \"bbq\" restaurants. They also have angry orchard draft at a decent price, will be coming back."}
{"text":"Deelish BBQ. If you are craving tasty cooked meat, and sides of comfort, go here. Lucille's has a lively atmosphere and an extensive menu. Their location is convenient."}
{"text":"Marginal food. Sadly it really doesn't deliver very good food. Their complimentary bread is dry and basically just tastes like dough. The cheese grits were bland and they were out of their house wine. The baby backs ribs were so so but the southern fried chicken was good."}
{"text":"The pomegranite martini was my favorite part.  The beef ribs are amazing!  Not a fan of the beans and the macaroni and cheese is alright.  They do really good job with the meat...the sides are ok.  It confuses me that there are 2 entrances and the check in is in the middle of the resturant.  It gets really crowded in the middle of the resturant during peak times."}
{"text":"Lucilles is a good BBQ chain resturaunt. The ambiance is that of the south. There are pictures that cover the walls and a huge smoker in the middle of the restaurant.  We were promptly greeted and walked to a table. The resturaunt was fairly empty and they seated us right at the kitchens entrance. I hate sitting where the waiters zoom by every second,  it's a weird feeling. We asked to sit at a booth and the waitress was more than cool about it. We were served hot biscuits with brown sugar butter, they were addicting. The drinks came in awesome huge  mason jars and they kept coming. I love it when waiters refill your drink with a separate glass.  The food was really good, BBQ tri-tip is on point. Fried cajun shrimp ~so good!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place. Inside the Red Rock casino.
Both this place and the casino are so clean and beautiful.
We shared the 1/2 chicken and 2 sides. It was so so tasty. The big corn bread muffin was probably the best muffin I have had at a BBQ joint.
I wanted so bad to get the beef ribs but due to my diet oh well.
Prices average. Service was great.
Love the big suckers you can get when you leave.
Oh boy you sure will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Currently eating its my first time here the food is amaze balls! I got a lunch platter with St. Louis style ribs tri tip pulled pork and fries EVERYTHING IS AMAZEBALLS!! Service is spectacular too the servers and host! Would def come back"}
{"text":"I finished 3 full sodas before food came.  Service was really slow, as if they forgot to put order in."}
{"text":"Great food and great environment. I have been back 3 times and never has a single issue."}
{"text":"Holy crap. This place was ferociously delicoius. You guys don't even know. Most meals come with biscuits and apple butter, and if you eat that, you will have experienced the pinnacle of culinary delight. Seriously, they should call it angel buns and edible happiness. Everything I put in my mouth was a good life choice (and I'm a picky eater). Also, the wait staff is awesome. Our waitress, Simone, was super sweet and handled my special requests for dish modifications so well.

Seriously. Eat here. You will have a good day."}
{"text":"Pretty good eats.  They serve you water in mason jars.  You get bread with APPLE BUTTER prior to your meal.  YUM.

I ordered a beef brisket platter, and was pleasantly surprised by its sheer size.  That is a LOT of food.  And you get two sides along with it - I chose the sweet corn (amaz.) and the garlic mashed potatoes (LURVE IT.)  Left quite full.

And they have mojitos.  Of several different flavors.  Cucumber mojitos. what?

And the ambience of this particular Lucille's, located in The District, is quite cute - it's as if you're in someone's home.

All in all, a pretty good meal - not the best barbecue I've had, but still a pretty good meal."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork sandwich. Great biscuits. Service is hit or miss live music on Saturday nights."}
{"text":"The food was very good overall, but not outstanding, and at those prices, it should be outstanding.  The service was good, the waitress was attentive and pleasant.  The BBQ shrimp app was excellent.  The ribs, brisket, chicken and pulled pork were all good.  The corn bread was dry, the bisquits were very nice.  Unfortunately I pulled a star because this may be one of the most expensive BBQ places in Vegas.  Worth a visit, but can't make it a habit."}
{"text":"Ribs are good. But this place is waaaaaay overpriced. Go to Rolling Smoke it's better and cheaper"}
{"text":"So disappointing. I've eaten here so many times and had nothin but rave reviews; that was before I became a Yelper. :)

Server must have been having a bad night because she set the whole time which was basically not good. I want to say how good the food was (appetizer was the fried shrimp and I love it every time) but I don't want to take focus away from how bad the service was. Dang it! I was going I take a picture of the stack of appetizer, salad, and side plates at the end of our table cause they were there for sinking and when I finally decided to whip out the camera she cleared them. Must have seen me typing. Lol. Refills were non existent, server forgot Jen's beer she ordered after being seated and finally brought it after my second refill on soda and after Jen asked for a different beer. She was apologetic and I'm the last person to be mean or belittle a server unless they are outright rude. Our server wasn't rude; just having a bad night i guess. The table next to is were being jerks so maybe it's all their fault. Lol

Our food came and I ate so now I can talk about the food. Aaaaarrgh! No that wasn't a pirate roar. It was the sound of frustration. I really do love this place. And I was sooooo determined tom order something different than the New Orleans chicken which I can't seem to tear myself away from. Tonight, I was a pioneer; a trend setter; Capt. Kirk. In orders their marinated steak cooked mid rare. Mmmmmmm. Well ironworks have been of it wasn't over cooked and completely bland and flavorless. If that hunk of meat had been marinated for 24 hours like the menu states, it must have been in a bucket of water.  Booooo. See what happens when you try new things!  Jen order ribs and some \"burnt ends\" bbq'd meat combo. They were good. That's all I can say. I didn't even ask for a box for mine. 

Also, I'm all for a nice AC environment during the AZ summer but holy smokes, I couldn't find a knife so I cut my steak with my nipples. Good thing I wore long sleeves or I would have had I amputate due to frostbite. 

Ok so in closing. Jen is quoted as saying, \"I loved my food.\" Everything else sucked. I have never had a bad experience here before I'm over a half dozen visits in the last couple years. That makes this so much harder because I think my feelings got hurt. I have bragged about this place to so many I should be getting kick backs. Don't these people know who I am. Geesh!  Lol. I'm sure I will be back but I won't be so eager to do so anytime soon.  I'm sad now. :(

P.S.  Quit taking my silverware and leaving me nothing to eat with. Also, the Mac and cheese was bland and was really bad.  There is virtually no cell service and absolutely no wi-fi. So frustrating. Ok I'm done."}
{"text":"So yummy! The peach moon is my favorite drink. They also have good happy hour specials. Gumbo is almost as good as New Orleans.The atmosphere is great and the building and decor is cute."}
{"text":"I can't rate it lower than this because we never had the chance to try the food. My wife and I decided to skip the hour long wait at GVR buffet due to Veterans Day crowd and decided on Lucille's. My wife is from KC, BBQ Heaven, so she and I know the drill. We checked in only to be told 5-10 minutes for which judging by the empty tables in dining room and bar area, didn't make sense. We ended up waiting 25 mins for a table while the staff stood there with empty tables and several that had not been cleared. We were seated in area behind the bar area right next to a party of 20 something and couldn't even hear each other. We sat with our menus for 10 mins with no one even bringing water or asking for a drink order. We looked at each other and got up, walked out. 

1. Under staffed? Shame on the manager down the street a casino offering free buffet not anticipating crowd he might get on Tuesday night from their overflow.
2. Poorly trained staff that didn't put butts in seats 
3. What I did see of menu had turkey meal, BBQ restaurant or Coco's?

We won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"I love BBQ, and am new to the scene in regards to dining out at different locations trying to figure out who's BBQ makes me the happiest. 

Lucilles definitely has it going on. Its a large restaurant and its well decorated. PLENTY of seating for all different sized parties.   Blues music playing in the background.  Remarkably, Patrick (my Sunday date guy) and I had no wait whatsoever.  Usually, when I see this place, theres always people waiting outside.  Not this time!

they served us a basket of biskets.  um, but only 2 biskets were in there.  um, WHY?  WHY ONLY 2 AT A TIME?  That was annoying.   We didnt like that!!  Why couldnt they have given us at least 4?  

They also served us our drinks in Mason jars.  I think thats a southern thing?  I liked it!  Eventually our food came out and I got the brisket sandwich with garlic potatoes and Patrick got the shreded chicken sandwich with Macaroni and cheese as a side.  We passed on desert.

Anyways, I would come back here.  It was a decent time had by all."}
{"text":"Nice staff, good portions, delicious food and a clean restaurant with interesting decor. We only wish we lived closer so we could dine here more often.  Good variety of food."}
{"text":"Had the tri tip with portobello mushroom sandwich that was very good. Service was kinda slow though."}
{"text":"I love Lucille's but was very disappointed with our recent trip here... We made a resevations for a party of us and we were seated quckly and all went good with this part of our night. Service was just not good at all! We had to wait forever for our drinks to come, they gave only one person our table of 12 and he was over whelmed because he had multiple other tables. He then took awhile to take our order and asked if we wanted to order appetizers, someone at our table ordered some for all.. 

We should have just placed our regular order at this point... We are now about an hour an half into dinner and our appetizers finally came and then he asked if we wanted to place our meal order. We did, knowing it was going to take a while why didn't he just place this together or sooner than the appetizers came? 

By the time our food came we were full on appetizers and drinks and honestly could tell you if it was amazing or not. 

Wish service was faster, we were here for 3 hours... Good thing the Jazz music was good towards the end or probably would have complained a little more while here..

PROS: 
Strawberry Lemonade was good
Our appetizers were good

CONS:
not good for large parties
service was not up to par
food came out slow"}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong eating here. Just be prepared to wait a while to be seated. Don't fret tho, they have a good bar to get a drink from while you are waiting. You just may hear the band play while you are waiting for your drink! You will usually hear bluesy and jazzy type of music here. I like the decor of the place, old, southern junkyard is what I call it for lack of a better term. Hubcaps, signs, chain link like fences separating the rooms. They have EXCELLENT beef ribs! Add their great potato salad to that and you just may experience the big O while you are there lol"}
{"text":"We came here after my niece's 1st Communion. We got there not long after they opened but we still had to wait about 10 minutes to get the table ready. Lu was our server and he was pretty peppy. 

After taking our drink orders..it seemed like FOREVER until he came back with our drinks and biscuits. Granted we did have more than 15 people in our party but another server helped out and brought out ONE cup of coffee to help Lu out.

After handing out all of our drinks we were ready with our orders. My sis and I ordered the BBQ Two Meat Combo Platter with beef ribs and St. Louis ribs. For our sides we got the mac and cheese and braised greens.

It's been awhile since I've been to a Lucille's but I did remember that their biscuits were good and their drinks are served in large mason jars. The strawberry lemonade was a little on the sweet side but still good. My sister ordered a Peach Moon which had Blue Moon beer, peach schnapps, and orange juice. I had a taste of it and it was really good.

Our food came not too long after which we were very relieved we didn't have to wait that long compared to our drinks. The beef ribs were tasty. However the ribs weren't consistent. One was tender while the other was overcooked and tough. I've come to the realization that I don't like St. Louis ribs. This was probably the third time trying it and it's not my cup of tea. Unless all three places just didn't cook them right. The mac and cheese was just ok, as well as the greens. I tried some of the sweet potato friends and those were sooooo good! My sis and I both agreed it's probably one of the best we've had. They were very crispy but still was creamy when you bit into it. I also liked the Cajun spice sprinkled on it.

For dessert we shared a red velvet cake a la mode. Unfortunately they forgot the ice cream but served it after. The cake was just ok to me. The frosting was a little too sweet for me. 

Overall it was a good meal and besides the slow beginning, Lu was friendly and attentive. I'm not from Vegas so I probably won't come back to this location but I'd go back to the one in my area. The Peach Moon is a very refreshing drink!"}
{"text":"Save your money! I thought since it was the Red Rock and expensive it would be good. Nope! Baby back ribs, potato salad, and garlic potatoes. This was like you went to Albertsons and bought the pre mix packages and the worse meat then cooked it the way a fast food restaurant would. Same for their sauce. It's terrible and all generic!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just ok. I'm not a huge BBQ person which is part of the reason. They also have huge portions and since it's not the healthiest food I always leave feeling like I should not have eaten that. 

I think next time I should just opt for a salad with dressing on the side."}
{"text":"This place is really good. The biscuits and apple butter... yummy!  Be careful because you might accidentally fill up on that. I had the brisket, baby back, and hotlink lunch combo. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because the beef was a little dry but STILL very delicious.  The Original Sauce is my favorite of the three that they offer and the peach lemonade is huge and refreshing.  The staff is very friendly!!! Next time I'm in Vegas I'll be sure to stop for some good food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always liked Lucille's, however, the last 3 times that we have tried to eat here, we've either left before we were seated or left after a 15 minute wait at our table without getting a hello from our server. The food is always good, but the service always seems to leave a bitter taste in our mouths.

Update 06/27/2016 - We gave Lucille's another shot this past weekend and we were impressed with the service compared to our past experiences. We were seated quickly, our waitress was prompt and friendly and food was good. We were, however, very disappointed to see that po'boys and okra are no longer on the menu."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is amazing. The menu is full of awesome perfectly portion sized entrees, appetizers and desserts. The atmosphere is classic southern style, family oriented and has a dimmed bar. Love it! Will be returning."}
{"text":"My best place for enjoying BBQ...I started in their Brea CA location and same great taste here in Henderson, NV!"}
{"text":"I can dig the BBQ here.  Food was pretty good and portions were just right.  I appreciate the wide selection of BBQ items, but I only ordered two - half CK & Pull Pork and they were both good.  Decor is alright, but I've definitely seen a better BBQ joint or I guess I should say more southern style-like.  It's a chain and I gotta give them a break - \"A\" for effort.  I really like the porch style seating, but really wonder what it's like during the hot summers hmmm...just makes me skirm when I think about eating and sweating at the same time - Yuck!  I gotta make a come back to taste the rest of the BBQ items for sure!  So if you're craving for some BBQ hit me up! :)"}
{"text":"We love this place. Food is amazing all the time. The other day we went in probably 9:45pm-ish (1 hour and 15 mins before closing), the hostess was kind and sat us promptly. We get to the table and order our drinks, and get them.  All of this takes maybe 6 mins give or take. 
The server then asks what we'd like to order and thinking they'd start cleaning the kitchen like 30 mins before closing, and it's still a little more than an hour until this time, we ask for a couple more minutes to browse. 
The server, who was quite obviously irritated and ready to be done, let's us know that the kitchen is closing in 2 minutes so we have to order now. So, my guest and I look at each other, cause the hostess perhaps should have informed us the kitchen was closing? Or maybe not even seated us at all? The server (maybe after seeing the slight shock on our faces) apologizes. We make a quick decision, and he's off. 

I do totally understand that at the end of the day you're ready to go, but I work in the service industry, and you're supposed to smile and make the guests comfortable. Perhaps the farther from the strip, hospitality isn't a priority? We felt so uncomfortable because we were so clearly not wanted there, that we had a few bites in the restaurant, got to-go boxes and left.

I get that kitchens need to be cleaned and closed, but an hour before the restaurant is due to close? Come on. 

Honestly, as wild as it sounds, we both agreed the vibe from our server made us lose our appetite. It was really odd. We both left feeling super uncomfortable. Having an uncomfortable feeling around people who deal with your food is never good. While waiting for the food we even joked about them going all 'Waiting' on us cause we really felt like awful humans for even daring to disgrace them with our presence. 

It's not that they were rude, it's just a very crappy feeling eating somewhere (or being anywhere in general) when it feels like a burden. We are very understanding people, and we just wanted a quick meal to end our night, but instead our night ended very uncomfortably and left this particular location with a bad first and probably last impression."}
{"text":"Lucille's serves up a really first rate BBQ sandwich. I tried the tri-tip. The meat was very tender and very tasty. The sourdough bread tasted fresh and their sweet potato fries were as good as I've had anywhere. They leave 3 different BBQ sauces on the table - nice touch.

Although a chain, they did have both from San Tan Brewery and Four Peaks on tap. Two of each. A solid plus to the usual bud, bud-light, coors, coors light sameness.

I met up with one of my daughters (who bought me dinner), so the company was fabulous. The over ambiance is OK - good place to bring a group."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best food you'll find in Tempe Marketplace. The decor is creative, emulating everything that comes to mind when you think of enjoying BBQ on a patio in the South.

Nothing about the prices here are outrageous, and the portions...they're freaking huge! Being not much of a red meat eater, I ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich. I couldn't finish it; there were two whole chicken breats, a mountain of *amazing* fries, and a fat slice of watermelon. Got it with a jar of sweet tea (perfect tea, by the way!) and a Maker's Mark mint julep that knocked me out of my chair. I also sampled some fried green tomatoes when were decent, and even  rib, which was the best I've had in the restaurant.

There are some poor reviews for this place, so let me preempt some complaints many of you would have while reading this review.

\"But Taric! The service was slow!\"

Even though it was busy, the server made my family and I feel comfortable and important. This is a large restaurant in the middle of a crowded urban center, they do their best and you should be patient.

\"But Taric...this isn't AUTHENTIC!\"

In a land of nothing but Chipotle this and somethingbertos, this is as close as you're gonna get, and they do a damned good job!

Quite frankly, this is the best BBQ I've had besides family cookouts. Ignore the yuppies giving it two stars and try it anyway...you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Lucilles is hands down my favorite place to eat. Redrock is a great casino and this bbq joint will not disappoint!  From the sweet tea to the complimentary pre meal biscuits and cinnamon butter it's so good! I always get the pulled pork sandwich. My fiance and other family members seem to agree the ribs are incredible.  Great service, great atmosphere. I moved to alabama so I will miss being a regular at lucilles!"}
{"text":"I am not from the south therefore I cannot determine what authentic barbecue really is, but Lucille's delivered an exceptional dining experience. 

The service was quick and hospitable. They almost instantly brought out their biscuits with apple butter. These are delicious! I ordered the artichoke dip as an appetizer, and the brisket sandwich as my entrée. The artichoke dip was good, but the brisket sandwich was amazing! It was cooked to perfection with a sweet barbecue glaze over the top. The meat literally fell apart inside the potato bun. I would definitely recommend this sandwich. I also like the fact that Lucille's puts their drinks in mason jars. And if you are still thirsty after your meal, they offer a soda to go!

Overall, the service was friendly enough to make me feel welcome and the food was undoubtedly delicious. Lucille's deserves this five star rating. If you enjoy southern style/ barbecue food, this is an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"Spicy shrimp and avocado salad-It was delicious!!
Bbq lunch platter- st louis ribs, chicken and the sausage. Very good
Kids meals were very large. They got the burger which had more bread than meat. My son got the chicken strips and complained they were dry. 
The biscuits were good. The drinks were large and you won't need a refill!!
The food was really great. Our server was super nice too!!
Family of 4 the bill for lunch was...$58.20 before tip:)
We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and so far the tri-tip and brisket are my favorite.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was alright. However all 3 of us got sick from something on the menu. Acid reflux was in full effect tonight. Drinking gaviscon was not really on my to do list tonight until I began seeing the return of my dinner from Lucille's. The suspected dish could be the sausage trio appetizer, or perhaps my Kentucky chicken sandwich which was advertised to me by our waitress as having 4 sweet pickles...however to my surprise, not a single pickle in sight."}
{"text":"Never going to come here again-
We have had 3 experiences here-
First was so bad that the manager paid for our cold meal, 
Second was ok.  
But this was the last straw-
Seriously waited nearly 45 minutes before we got tired of it and left- we weren't the only ones either-
They weren't busy- if they were I'd tolerate the incompetence.
I say incompetence because literally we watched a table wait 15 minutes for their waitress to stop walking around looking busy but not accomplishing anything, just to try to get their check-
When we left they still hadn't gotten the check- 20 minutes later.

Simply put- managerial skills need to be put in heck and staff need to re-trained."}
{"text":"Had dinner on Friday and boy was it good. Had brisket nachos which were pretty good and a little bit of spice. Had burnt ends and ribs for dinner. Let's just say they were no leftovers."}
{"text":"Not my first time here. Went to one in CA and wasn't much of a fan then, but thought i'd give it another try. Beef ribs were good as well as the chicken.BBQ sauces aren't bad but the Tri tip was eh and the brisket was pretty bad. The brisket was really dry and just kinda crumbled in your mouth. Gross. Overall I don't think it is worth the price and I would much rather go to famous dave's."}
{"text":"The last time we were here my husband and I were not too impressed with food but there was a long wait at the buffet so we decided to try it one more time.  Our server Kayleigh was amazing!!! She gave us wonderful service and the food was much better this time around.  If you have a craving for BBQ food and are in the area go to Lucille's and ask for Kaleigh."}
{"text":"My dad loves this place and therefore, we have to go with him every time he comes to town.  And he comes to town a lot.  I have to say that Lucille's is very consistent with their food.  I'll admit that I'm not a seasoned vet when it comes to BBQ so I think Lucille's is pretty great.  My wife and I had our rehearsal dinner here a couple years ago and they were very accommodating and everyone had a great time.  My friends and I have gone here for a number of Happy Hours because they have pretty great specials on apps and drinks.  You pretty much can't go wrong with one of their platters.  Half a chicken, ribs, meats, and pretty good sides.  Their cheesy grits are a family favorite.  There have been a few rare occasions where service isn't up to par but for as many times as I have gone here it has been pretty good.  The food is good and for Happy Hour, this place is great!"}
{"text":"Was absolutely juiced to go here , then we got there , the singlemost overpriced bbq i have ever seen , im from KansasCity and this place sucks. Beautiful building , horrible food. Got a brisket sandwich with liitle chopped up chunks of dried up brisket served with a sauce that was horrid. All the sauces reaked of vinegar , prices were ridiculous , 30+ for most dinners. Fried chicken was 20. Saveyourself alot of disappointment and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed. Only 3 ribs !! small side of beans. VERY overpriced !!!!  There are a lot of new BBQ joints nearby that beat the pants off of this place. Sorry but I will NOT be back ."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time and we both thought it was great.  I think it was the best BBQ place we've been to.  I got BBQ Half Chicken & Two Meat Platter and hubby got BBQ Two Meat Combo Platter.  The ribs were tender, the chicken was flavor-able, the ribs tips were good, the pulled chicken was great, the coleslaw was good (I like mine creamy), the corn on the cob was delicious.  The only thing we did not like was the mac and cheese.  The shrimp and corn fritters was just okay.  
The service was great from the host, the person who sitted us, the server, and even the manager came by.
We are definitely planning on returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  We originally wanted Yardhouse, but the wait was over an hour, and boy are we glad we came here instead!  Food was super yummy, and incredibly affordable.  Loved the biscuits and butter, best I've ever had.  AND the waitress was nice enough to pack me up a doggy bag full of them to take.  Another plus was the basket of tootsie rolls; my kids adored that aspect of it.

We liked it so much, we came back the next day for lunch prior to returning back to San Diego!  Please please please bring one to San Diego!!"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with Dylan P from Dallas Texas. Memphis is OK, Lucilles is amazing. They have these huge platters that are big enough for two people and some take home. PLUS, they have okra. And, the okra is pretty good. I mean, they have spinach, corn, potatoes, and a whole bunch of other sides. I think they have some type of pickle thing or something, that they keep trying to push on me. But that okra is just too good.
That butter they have for the bread, what is that...apple butter? Oh man, it is like buttahhhh...seriously.
At the end of the night, you get a tootsie pop, and hopefully you get one with the indian shooting a star."}
{"text":"Had never been before and was told to check it out. Great food and great service by Lindsey."}
{"text":"We've been coming to Lucille's for years.  We've been so frequently that I realized I have never done a yelp review on the place.  I thought I had already.  So, since I went to the Red Rock location recently and didn't have a great experience, I think it's only fair to sing the praises of the location at the District.

This is a large restaurant, and easily seats large groups.  When family comes into town, we usually have a meal at Lucille's. It's kid friendly as well, in both the menu as well as the restaurant set up.  So, no problems there.

I usually get the sweet tea or strawberry lemonade.  Both are winners, and come in huge mason jars.  Even with a lot of ice (which is how I order my drinks) you get plenty of your beverage. 

To start, we typically get fried pickles, fried okra, or onion straws.  Okra is a dish that not a lot of places in Vegas offer.  I wish they offered it as a side and not just an appetizer.  The appetizers are a good value, as they are large enough to feed many (particularly the onion straws).

To eat, I usually get some form of BBQ, or the mardi gras chicken.  This is probably my favorite dish at Lucille's, it's 2 large chicken breasts which have been breaded and fried.  It comes with garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables, and a great shrimp cream sauce with peppers.  I always have leftovers, and it reheats well.  This is a unique dish worth giving a shot.  I also get the fried chicken sandwich and usually take half of that home.

This is a large menu, but they get it right.  We usually leave happy, and usually with leftovers.  Even though there may be a wait, the place is so large it's usually not that long.  If the weather permits (it's not over 100 degrees outside) I recommend the patio."}
{"text":"After eating at the District Lucille's for years, I was expecting to like this location at least as much as I like the District location.  I will say, the bar is much nicer.  The seats are comfortable, you don't feel crammed, and there are plenty of TVs.  From where we were sitting, each guy was easily able to see his NFL game of choice.  

But, the food fell short of the District location.  The fried onion straws were pretty much the same, they needed seasoning.  But, I find this to be the issue at the District location as well.  My catfish po' boy, on the other hand, was nowhere near the quality I get at the District location.  The bread was tough, not quite stale, but certainly not fresh.  This problem was compounded by the fact that the sandwich, which comes with 2 sauces, was nearly dry.  So, I had to order more of each sauce (a remoulade and tartar sauce).  This wait caused the sandwich to cool down, which made eating it less pleasant when I finally got the sauces.  The macaroni and cheese was standard, it was similar if not exactly the same as the District location.

I'm sure I'll give the Red Rock Lucille's another shot.  The service was good, and like I said, it's a much better bar area.  But, I'll order something else and hope that this food is more similar to the food I've enjoyed for years at the District location."}
{"text":"Read about this on Yelp. It's Father's day so was kinda busy. Sat at the bar. Bartenders were great. Brought out an order of biscuits that were definitely homemade.   Helped me order pulled pork sandwich and a couple ribs. Not on the menu as a package.  Would have cost an arm and a leg but she did something where I got what I wanted without spending a fortune. The beans were tasty,the Memphis style pulled pork sandwich was great. The ribs...perfectly smoked."}
{"text":"Lucille's opened a few years back at The District near Green Valley Ranch. This is a solid BBQ-type restaurant with excellent food and very good service as well.

If you're at all into BBQ, this is the restaurant for you. The menu is large and diverse, and covers pretty much every end of the spectrum. Whether you want steak, pork, ribs, chicken, or anything in between, they'll more than likely have something up your alley. Additionally, the restaurant often has blues bands playing in its bar area. 

The restaurant itself is excellent, however there are some problems. The parking is TERRIBLE. This is a lot shared with much of The District, which right off the bat means that there are going to be minimal places to park. As if this wasn't bad enough, they have blocked off a large portion of the lot for (unneeded!) valet parking. Even worse, an old dirt lot used for overflow parking (which is now needed more than ever!) has been blocked off. Furthermore, wait times can get pretty gruesome during peak hours, even moreso than other restaurants of its kind.

All things considered, though, this is a superb BBQ restaurant if you can deal with the piss-poor parking.

{"text":"We tried this place out and we were glad that we did. Bartender Darrance was extremely patient with my friend who is extremely high maintenance. He kept asking questions until he zeroed in on what she wanted and then crafted the perfect beverage. Thanks Darrance!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"They had amazing service. Our server was John super fast and friendly. Helpful to my boyfriend who has never been here before.

We ordered the fried pickles and the breeding was just falling off to the point I just grabbed the pickle out and ate it that way.

We both ordered the pulled pork sandwiches I got mine original style he did the other option they had with coleslaw. Before putting any BBQ sauce from the table the pulled pork didn't have ugh flavor it was pretty bland. I added my favorite of their BBQ sauce and it was fine. I'm an original BBQ sauce fan of theirs however I didn't realize they really depend on it for the flavor of their pulled pork.

My side was the honey peanut coleslaw and that was amazing. The garlic mashed potatoes was also delicious.

My decision for 3 stars is based on the entire place as a whole my main course shouldn't be bland if you're a BBQ place yet everything else is spot on."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Nice dinner rolls with sweet butter. The happy hour menu is off the hook! Cheese fries, BBQ ribs, and bbq chicken are my favorites. Def worth checking out."}
{"text":"I was visiting the Red Rock Casino today 1-28-2017 to do business with a very important client. He wanted to take me to his very favorite place Lucille's and I was open to the suggestion. The resterant for lunch time was oddly pretty empty. Clean environment. The hostesses were giggling like little school girls. My client really wanted a bigger booth and it seemed like it was such a chore for the red headed gal to place us there.
   Our server was an awesome young man with glasses,he was quick and efficient. No complaints with him. Me and client both order different things. I happen to order the Wedge Salad,unfortunately it dose not specify on the menu it included a bacon on top, no big deal to me when I just sent it back when a female running server,brunette with short bobbed hair cut gave me the look of death. I read clients and work with people everyday so I can read people very well. She was reluctant but seemed mad. A minute later as we were placed in our booth next to the kitchen my client stops me and says do you hear them yelling in the kitchen about your salad. I was a little shocked but kept moving on because its my client's choice and I have big money running with this client business.
  My chicken was not cooked extra dry/longer when I had asked. I was not surprised about the other reviews I have seen on here. If the client wants to take me there again thats fine as its his choice but not mine in the future at any time."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the service was slow to start. The two bartenders who were back there never greeted me when I met my friend who was always sitting there. He finished his beer & was waiting for one of them to cash him out. He even asked one of them who was walking by & he ignored him. I left the bar to get a table and my friend was still waiting for the bartenders to cash him out while I waited for the table. When we finally got our table, we waited for a good 5 minutes before the server came, but after that she was very attentive. She was knew the menu well & was able to answer our questions. The food came out quickly & it tasted great. I got the brisket & cleaned my plate. I would definitely try this place out again."}
{"text":"I love love love everything about this place. 

Some of my favorites: Watermelon iced tea, peach lemonade, southern chicken egg rolls, country fried chicken, BBQ ribs, pulled pork street tacos, mash, mac & cheese, apple butter with warm sugared biscuits.. Mmm :)

Service is always on point. Decent happy hour food. Cool atmosphere. When my boyfriend & I can't decide where to eat Lucille's has become our go-to place!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite smokehouses for bbq when it comes to family dinners. I highly recommend the family feast if your out with a group! 
For my first visit I had the backyard family feast that feeds a family of 4, however it really would feed a group of 6-8! You get 4 sides and your choice of 2 racks of ribs and 2 half bbq chicken! 

The second family feast is Lucille super feast, serves 10.  You get 3 racks of bbq ribs , 4 half chickens, 6 sides, and a salad! My family and I celebrated my nieces 21st birthday (party of 15) This feast would serve up to 14-16 ! We definitely had a lot of left overs! 
Customer service is always great when we are there ! For our party we didn't know they would give us a closed off part of the restaurant just to accommodate and make everything comfortable for us!"}
{"text":"Fried green tomatoes is excellent. Family feast from the menu is a must. Service needs some improvements though."}
{"text":"We were walking around Tempe marketplace and really didn't know where we wanted to eat until my wife started to smell the BBQ. So we decided on Lucille's. I've been here quite a few times but never wrote a review. 

The place is decorated somewhat southern and very welcoming. We were surprised that we were seated right away and the server was right there to greet us. Nice. 

We started off with the biscuits and apple butter. The apple butter is so good. I'm glad we didn't have that many biscuits cause we would have filled up on that. Anyways, I had the brisket with Mac & Cheese and corn on the cob. The brisket was really good with the extra BBQ sauce smothered on it. Tender and juicy. The Mac and cheese was very good and the corn on the cob was smothered in butter and was cooked just right. My wife had the fried catfish and shrimp. Very good. Catfish was very moist and crispy on the outside. Also, the shrimp was cooked just right. Just the right portions for my wife. So overall the food was very good. Enjoyed the food and company. 

As for the service. Really good. Our server greeted us. Very friendly and kept on checking on us. She didn't have to fill up our water cause they bring you out these huge jars for your drinks. Also, the greeter were very friendly and smiling all the time. Very welcoming. 

Overall I enjoy our time there. Good food and service."}
{"text":"Very homie, reminds me of southern comfort. Food was great! Service was pretty good. My family and I had a great time!"}
{"text":"Cold food . Very slow service . Only ordered s baked potatoe and side salad... took over 25 minutes... salad took longer . Had ty o send potatoes bac k to get warm... never will return . Everyone was complaining.  Sad place"}
{"text":"Love  the smoke bacon burger. Biscuit and ribtip were awesome . Service was great. Come back for sure"}
{"text":"Lucille's is never not a good idea! I love this place and every time I've either sat down or ordered take-out the staff is really nice. 

Can't get enough of the tri-tip sandwich with sweet potato fries, I'm pretty sure this is one of their most popular items on the menu. A must try!

Definitely one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"I am usually a bit of a BBQ snob but Lucille's food quality didn't disappoint. We had the tri-tip, burnt ends, and the sausage trio and all were tasty. Of the sausages our favorite was the hot links. The pre-meal biscuits with sweet butter were a nice touch and $4 house beers hit the spot.  The drink menu was great as well. 

If I were to have any negatives about the food, it would be that some of the meats came with sauce already on them. I think you can request no sauce but that should be the default.  Also, the prices are a bit steep for a chain bbq restaurant but, again, the food was delicious so we didn't have a problem with the final bill."}
{"text":"I love this place!! This is by far my favorite BBQ place!  They give you complimentary biscuits with apple butter before the meal comes out....so delicious!! The texture of the biscuit is perfect!  Warm and fluffy on the inside. The burger was the best I've ever had!  The meat patty was perfectly cooked and the cheese you could taste in every bite!  The peach cobbler for dessert was legit!!! Tasted  like homemade!"}
{"text":"I'm was very upset with my waitress!!! She got the wrong order. I ask her for St Louis Ribs for $17.99. Instead she brought me brisket's. I ask for a manager a lady came by and saying sorry for the wrong order. She also said she won't charge me for the ribs I said that's not right. I told her I will pay the rest of my order and don't worry bringing me the ribs. I was already claiming down, until the waitress waited for the manager to leave and approach me and my family, she told me I did order the Brisket and my wife said it too. Not true at all plus my wife never said a thing. That fired me up and I was very upset with the waitress. I felt this waitress thinks I'm cheap and a lair. Screw you lady!!! I'm sorry you ruin my family dinner and I put in my profession 12 to 15 hours a day!!! Thanks a lot!!! The only thing clam me down is the lady manager. I will close on this, I did pay my drinks and also donated $10.00 plus the bill at $7.58 equal $17.58. I'm not cheap and I do tip good to people that care for customer service!!! I treat my customer with respect and truthful. I will not mention the lady's name, she knows. The positive thing is the band was playing there is awesome!!! Listen the food is good there and I will continue my business with the restaurant but somewhere else. Sorry but I don't like being treated like a lair plus cheap!!! Have a nice night. The lady manager was trying her best to make happy. Thank you for that, but I told you, I don't like be treated like crap. Sorry for this review but it needs to be said. 

Thank you 
Jayson Wells"}
{"text":"This place really impressed me.  Everything I ordered was so amazing that I had to come back a week later and order the same exact things.

They brought out biscuits with something called apple butter. Very filling, but so worth it. 

I had the buffalo wings for appetizer, which had just the right blend of flavor and kick.  Not very hot, but I really enjoyed the flavor.  

For my main course I ordered the 4 alarm burger and a watermelon lemonade drink (can't remember the name).  Burger was spicy, drink was strong, but refreshing.  Couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"The server/bartender stole my cc info. 
2 days after using a cc there, my cc company canceled the card due to multiple fraudulent attempted charges around Tempe, Mesa....
We looked at the card activity, the card was never physically out of my hands...
Except the 1 day at Lucille's. 
Think about it, when is the only time your cc is ever out of your hands/sight?
When the server takes it, walks away for a few minutes, and returns with your bill.
The only place I ever used that particular card where it was physically out of my sight, was Lucille's.....
2 days later the multiple fraudulent attempted charges began....
Luckily my CC company declined every attempt, canceled that card, contacted me, and sent me a new card..........
I KNOW IT WAS THAT SERVER/BARTENDER AT LUCILLE'S.

The only reason I am not going there to beat the sh*t out of that kid, is because we have begun an investigation ......"}
{"text":"For flavor, Lucille's gets 4 stars, but for price, it only warrants a 3-star rating. It's nice to me that you can see the smoker working, and the smoke flavor is present in the food and appetizing. I found the baby back ribs to be tasty but a little sparse on meat (I should have gone with St. Louis style). The brisket is great, but a little dry - easily fixed with a bit of sauce. The sides I've tried are all very good. I just find the price a little too high, so I can't say \"I'm a fan\". $28 for a rib-meat combo, $3 for a soda and $4 for a lemonade make it a good destination for an occasional dinner, but their competition in the valley are all under $20 for similar portions."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Tiffany is the best! She is super helpful and amazing. The portions are huge and delicious. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Lucille's is OK I guess. But I think I was siked just like I was siked at Jorges. The portrays on the walls show black people, black performers like The Jubilee Singers but just about all the staff there is white, look rockish and the displays kind of counteract the jazz feel to it. You know, I don't know?! Anyways, the best thing I would say about Lucilles is their speciality sauces because the BBQ Sauces was on point. They happy hour drinks too ain't bad either. The only thing I thought was meh- was the fried green tomatoes. But nonetheless, I wanted to try it, tried it now on to the next."}
{"text":"I just ate my take out order tonight (5 bbq beef ribs and two veggie sides). Unfortunately, the rubs weren't as good as I had previous times. Always I ordered them with light sauce and I received the opposite,  probably to cover up the low quality rib meat. I really feel highly disappointed because the restaurant is so close to my house. The only reason, I gave 3 stars is because I enjoyed the food before. If I had to rate tonight's meal it would be 1 star if that!"}
{"text":"The food here always satisfies! Definitely come here when you are beyond hungry, the portions are huge! You can't go wrong with the southern fried chicken; always a go to for me. I am sure everything on the menu is delicious. The muddy waters is a classic- half ice tea, half lemonade. I tried mine with peach ice tea this time. PERFECTION! Try and leave some room for dessert. I am always stuffed to the brim before I even can get to the dessert menu. Ask for Khristina, she will take care of you and she is super sweet!"}
{"text":"Savannah took great care of us. The food included large portions and huge mason jars. They offer natural lemonade and also delicious ribs. The place is clean and offers great service from the moment you walk in. I will definitely come back and recommend."}
{"text":"Always great service! the food is delicious and the biscuits are my favorite item. Their apple butter is a unique spread that everyone loves. My wife uses it in her mashed potatoes, she swears by it, despite the bewildered looks from our servers.

They are light on the vegetarian options however that is to be expected. They do have a delicious veggie burger. Honestly, you smother anything with any of their signature sauces and it will taste delicious."}
{"text":"The most consistent BBQ joint on the West Coast. This establishment is quite excellent. I recommend any location. Thank you. I'm here all week. Every location. I'm here all week. Every location."}
{"text":"We haven't had a chance to revisit Lucilles since the last visit, but after my recent review I received almost immediate feedback from the management of the company. The apologized for the issues and mailed me a gift card and ask that we give them another chance. Any company that operates like that instantly deserves a one star bump. So 4 stars for these guys now and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"I have had it with Lucille's. The first time we visited the location at Green Valley, we enjoyed the food and had a great time which caused me to give a five star review. however following terrible experiences at both this and the other Las Vegas location I must give a review that is due. Since the opening of the Lucilles at Red Rock we tried it twice with horrendous results (see my reviews) so we decided to return to this location. The food is still pretty decent but the service and the pricing bites. I am not referring to the pricing on the menu (which I do believe is a bit ridiculous for what you receive) I am referring to the nickel and diming they force you to pay. My favorite example is they make you pay $2.99 for a side salad on a $18.95 meal and then the salad does not have cheese on it. If you ask for cheese they charge you an additional $1.29. They stretch their servers and give them entirely too many tables which makes the service slow at best. We have never experienced the slowness that the Red Rock location has here, but it is still not that much better. If Lucille's wants to gain my business back they need to stop nickel and diming their customers, it would not be as bad if the prices on the menu were not as high as they are, but I cannot imagine why they need to nickel and dime at the prices they have already set. Shame on Lucille's, we won't be back."}
{"text":"This place literally opened a few days ago!  I knew I had to rush home and write this review, so I can be the 2nd person to review this place! When searching for a  restaurant to eat at, today at work, my eyes came across this restaurant.  I'm super familiar with Lucilles BBQ and definitely feel strongly about their food.  I was super excited to try this new location out!

It's located right next to the Yard House in the Red Rock Casino.  Such a beautiful location to begin with.  When you walk in, the hostess station blocks the entire restaurant, almost creating a curious affect amongst guests.  Once you round the corner, you're taken into a backyard BBQ oasis!  Southern pictures, vintage dressers and leg lamps from Rocky Horror Picture Show adorn the restaurant. The middle focal point is definitely the bar.  Huge rectangular bar top dressed with flat screens playing sports games and other shows.  You can't help but stare at it.  The restaurant is created to look like you're on gramma's porch, then in her backyard, then in a garden and even a Bourbon style hotel.  This location is unlike any other Lucille's that I've ever been to.  SUPER COOL!

The staff.  Man, the staff is on point!  I know this location just opened, however, they are really paying attention to the detail.  The greeters are perky and friendly, the seaters wasn't afraid to strike up a conversation with us as he sat us.  Our server, Joshua, was super attentive, nice and personable.  Whatever we needed, he was there to help.  All the other servers and serving assistants, kept coming back to our table and offering any type of service that would make our experience that much better.  In fact, during dinner, I looked my party and said, \"wow, what I like is that they always come around and clear any dirty dishes so our table isn't cluttered.\"  ON POINT.  The managers, Jessica, Chila and Jeff even came by to say hi.  

For dinner, we started with a full size order of the Southern Fried Dill Pickles for $6.49.  It came with 10 pickle spears, battered in spicy flour and deep fried.  This dish is accompanied with ranch dressing and creole mustard.  The batter is light and airy, the wedges aren't too sour, just right!  Juicy and delicious.  My favorite sauce, the creole mustard is flavorful and really enhances the overall taste.  Great dish.  For my meal, I got the Fried Shrimp Po' Boy Sandwich for $11.99.  One of my favorite sandwiches!  Lots of small fried shrimp served on a fresh baked baguette with shredded lettuce, vine-ripened tomatoes, smoked jalapeno tartar sauce and spicy remoulade.  The shrimp was super crispy, sliced tomatoes and lettuce offered a very refreshing taste to the sandwich.  The tartar and remoulade makes you think it's spicy, but certainly not.  The combination of both sauces really takes this sandwich to a whole new level.  It's a huge sandwich and will definitely fill you up!

Between the food, biscuits and apple butter, and mason jars, this place is certainly the BEST BBQ WITH THE FINEST SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY.  I'm so jealous of Summerlin residents.  I live in Henderson and frequent the District location.  This location is new, it's fresh, it's awesome!  When you're in the area, definitely check them out.  You will NOT be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Hands-down BEST smoked BBQ - and I have had my fair share. EVERYTHING is delicious: complimentary biscuits and butter, lean brisket, beef ribs, garlic mashed potatoes, real Mac N cheese...and the portions (to include drinks) are VERY generous. Lucille's has my loyalty."}
{"text":"Nice experience. They were busy so it took a few to get beverages but understandable.Lamont was our server.  He was very nice with a good sence of humor.  He had good suggestions  and helped make the visit  more then just good food."}
{"text":"Long ago when I was a teen, Lucilles was my favorite, even though it was one of the few BBQ places available in the suburb I was in. I haven't eaten one in years so I was curious to try it and we were at Red Rock to meet some friends. 

We came during Happy Hour at the bar area which includes drink specials and discounted appetizers (everyday 4 ) Off that menu we got fried pickle spears which had good flavor and came crunchy and hot, but a bit harder to eat than pickle rounds as the batter flaked off. 

We shared a half chicken plus (2 meat) hot link and pulled pork platter. The chicken and hot link were decent enough, but the pulled pork was a dried out mess. It includes two sides; I enjoyed their baked beans as it was tangy and sweet and the potato salad was standard, but good. We upgraded our biscuits to cornbread which was a generous portion and I enjoyed it. 

I enjoy the fact they have various kinds of sweet tea and lemonade. I had the watermelon tea which is mildly flavored with fresh watermelon and doesn't come sweetened but very good. 

Service was rather good. She checked on us, we got drink refills and the check all before we needed to ask for it. 

I find I enjoy more their sides than their BBQ here. I find that their BBQ taste just fine and that there are better BBQ spots out there. Is it weird that they have a indoor smoker and it doesnt smell of even a hint of smoke? I think I might stick to a la carte sides, appetizers during happy hour and their flavored teas and lemonade."}
{"text":"I have loved Lucille's ever since it first arrived in Brea, California...was delighted to discover there is one located in the Las Vegas area and had a wonderful lunch with my friends on 2/4...service was great, food was awesome....I brought back some baby back ribs, greens and grits for my friend, a woman who REALLY knows her soul food, and she absolutely loved everything!  Hope to visit Vegas again soon and have another incredible dining experience at Lucile's...y'all ROCK!!! P.S. Please come to Phoenix!!! xoxo"}
{"text":"A few of my friends have recommended Lucille's.  We went tonight with an old friend. 
It was amazing. Hubby and I shared a rack of baby back ribs. The meat just fell off the bones. Best ribs I've had in awhile. 
Service is pretty good. Fair prices."}
{"text":"Continuing on my \"kid free\" weekend, I went over ot Tempe Marketplace to return something at one of the stores there.  I suddenly realized that the only thing I had to eat was popcorn at the movie and that was over 4 hours ago.  So, I stated to think about what was at the Marketplace in terms of being \"kid free\" and having a decent dinner.  

I don't mind dining alone but on a Saturday evening when there are lots of families and dates going on, I'd rather not sit in the dining room alone so I bellied up to the bar.  It was pretty empty.  There was one other guy at the bar so I figured the bar tender would see me pretty fast.  Not the case, I waited about 5 minutes before I was acknowledged by someone other than the bartender.  I asked for some water and told him I was looking over the drink menu, not sure what I wanted yet.  Another 5 minutes went by and the bar tender came over, I ordered my drink and he asked if I would be having dinner.  I said yes so he got a menu.  I was somewhat taken aback by the prices.  I thought it was a tad bit expensive.  Since it was just me and I was giving myself a treat I thought, ok, just once.....unless it is just amazing bbq....you never know.  I finally made my decision and ordered 1/2 slab of baby back ribs.....it's bbq and that's usually how I gauge my bbq, by the ribs.  

My food came out piping hot.  The roll that was severed with the meal was flaky on the outside and tender inside.  The cinnamon butter was delish and a nice compliment.  I was never asked if I wanted another though.  I dug into the mac and cheese and it was hot and gooey with a nice flavor.  I got sweet potato fries too.....I know, I love carbs!  Wish I didn't but I don't have many vices.  :)  Those were tasty as well, hot and crisp. And now for the ribs. They were good.  Moist and tender, fall off the bone goodness.  The sause had a tiny bit of sweetness to it that I liked.  The Dbacks were playing the Dodgers and not doing so well so I took solice in my ribs.  

The atmosphere here is cute.  Down home southern style and comfy.  They had a blues combo playing in the bar and they were pretty darn good I must say.  The music made me feel better about watching the Dbacks loose to the Dodgers.  UGH!  

The service was just ok. Considering I was one of just two other people at the bar,   I could have been greeted faster.  I had a margarita that tasted a bit off to me.  And I felt that was pretty expensive too.  The food was good but for the price I can go other places and get something just as good.  In this economy I've got to save my pennies.  I also thought the service was lacking.  I would not have been pleased at all if I had been in the dining room.  But then again, one of two people at the bar and I wasn't greeted with a minute?  Not sure I will go back.....but thanks anyway."}
{"text":"Love love love the lemonade!!! I will come here just for the lemonade. My only complaint is I feel they don't bring out enough of those amazing biscuits and honey butter. I tried the back porch strawberry lemonade and didn't even know there was alcohol in it. I have never had a bad meal from here yet. But who can go wrong with BBQ?"}
{"text":"Wow everytime I have came to eat here it's 100% from the moment I walk in the door until I leave. The food, service, employees, everything! Me and my family always come here for any celebration dinner and have tried basically everything on the entire menu and there's not a single thing I disliked. Every food item is never regretting! My favorite is the Cajun chicken sandwich and the peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is a must!! Tonight we had Savannah as our server and she was honestly one of the best servers I've ever had from any restaurant! I literally had to jump on here to say how well she did because if recommend to anyone. I've always had great servers at lucilles but she was awesome. This place is to die for!!!! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome, but the quality of the food didn't match the price."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good but quite pricey even though you get big portions, you always have to take a bunch home.  I would like the option to buy less & pay less.  This is smoked meat, NOT BBQ.  Many people try to compare the two but they are different.  Some people just don't like smoked meat & some go in looking for BBQ and they will probably be disappointed.  If you like slow smoked meat you will be happy here. Also, if you truly like smoked meat, you already know to get the meat DRY, not WET.  The individual decides on how much if any sauce to put on.  Try their beef ribs(dry) if you like ribs.  Pork ribs just don't smoke as good in my opinion. I've been here 5 or so times and have never had anything dry, of course we go at lunch time so maybe its just fresher than at dinner (?)"}
{"text":"Came here and was blown away by the delicious food and outstanding hospitality provided by our server Tanner. He was such a great server, very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. He was so helpful in suggesting the some of the favs and he was right on point. We all left so full and raving that it was the best meal we have had in a long time.  We aren't locals but when we do visit we will deff be back and will most certainly be requesting Tanner"}
{"text":"The service was horrible.  We sat and waited for a drink forever.  Food came out fast but I had to get up and go ask for the check.  The food was bland and had no flavor. The pulled pork queso tasted like it came from a can and had no pulled pork on it.  It's gone down hill since I first went there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at Tempe Marketplace! LOVE the bisquits & apple butter they give you, and of course the baby back ribs are good. 
Their fried chicken is also BOMB and one day, my boyfriend and I were feeling adventurous so we tried the brisket and the tri cut. We went pretty late, so they only had the end of the brisket, but IT WAS AMAZING!!! Not sure how the regular cut is, but this was soo good. Definitely gonna try to order that again next time."}
{"text":"Our first time at the Red Rock Casino Lucille's location.  The seating was fast and friendly on a nice Monday all ate afternoon.

Hubby is a big fan of beef ribs and ordered the 5 Bone platter with sides of Mac and Cheese and Shoestring Fries.  Food was piping hot and tasty without being overcooked.  

I had the \"Front Porch\" combo plate consisting of 1/2 Smoked Chicken, one link of Smoked Sausage, one Cheddar and Bacon Sausage Link and 2 Beef Ribs.  My sides were my usual choices:  Collard Greens and Cheesy Grits.  Again, everything was piping hot and delicious!

All in all it was a very good experience.  The only negative we have is the restaurant isn't laid out very well for a handicapped person using a motorized scooter...areas are tight and there isn't a restroom in the restaurant.  You have to leave the restaurant and go into the casino for the restroom."}
{"text":"I like to come to Lucille's as I think the food is pretty good and decent for the price. I have had a few eh experiences however, where meat wasn't that good and the service was off. The brisket is usually tasty however and I like their bbq sauce a lot. Not crazy about the Cole slaw dressing, so would stick with their garlic mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Had the St. Louis ribs, they were excellent! Service was excellent, we will be back. You must come and check it out."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Nevada, I tried Lucille's and HATED it.  Thus, I was dismayed when my future in-laws came into town and just HAD to eat there.  Sigh.  

I guess this is a place where you just have to get the right thing.  The first time, my meat was dry and gag-worthy.  However, I ordered a brisket salad this time and absolutely fell in love with it.  My fiancé had the baby back ribs and just kept saying \"wow\" over and over.  Their tea is fantastic - the sweetened comes with a sprig of mint in it, while the unsweetened has a lemon wedge.  Perfect.

Oh, and to the poor waitress who was hit on by my perverted future FIL (in FRONT of the MIL, might I add)... I'm sorry you had to hide in the back and ask a big, BIG guy to bring our food out!"}
{"text":"The food is so so.  I was there several times and even if it is not busy it takes a long time to be seated.  The servers look like they have no clue what is going on.  One time there were 5 of us and they forgot one persons meal.  We stopped going there."}
{"text":"I love BBQ. I was borned and raised in Oklahoma--so you can't NOT love BBQ coming from there. 
I've had some amazing BBQ in my life from all over the US. Is this the best? No. Is it good? Yes. 
Some reasons why this place is one of my favorites in town:
The food is consistent. 
They have great BBQ sauce. 
Their burnt ends are delicious. 
Their sides are great. 
Their biscuits are fucking amazing. 

I've pretty much tried all of their meats here. They're all very good. I would like a little more tenderness to it or a smokey flavor. But it's not going to change. They're great for what they are. And for the price you pay, you get a heeping portion. So for us people who love to gorge or have leftovers--it's great. 

They're service is always hit or miss. Numerous times we've been here, the hotesses aren't the most friendly. They don't even greet you when you walk in--or they don't tell you they'll be with you in a minute. We've stood there awkwardly for awhile sometimes. 
Their waiters aren't the best either. Either they're amazing or they suck horribly. 
The bartenders have always been awesome though. So I prefer to sit at the bar if we don't have other people with us. 

Overall, if we want BBQ and don't want to drive far; we come here. There are some amazing joints in town for BBQ. This one sits right below the amazing ones."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty meats. Service was good, food was great. Ate way more than I should."}
{"text":"Took my dad for the first time here, 12/27 and I have to say it was the WORST service I've experienced in Vegas. Walking in the 2 people at the cash wrap we're not joyful or friendly at all. The guy who sifted us didn't acknowledge us at all nor did he care to talk at all but to say here's your menu. Walked off and our server Christine assisted us - she was neither helpful or cheerful. We had our food, it was ok compared to the charleston location. Me and my brother asked for some alcoholic drinks and my dad a soda. Me and my brother finished our drinks and sat for almost 20-30 minutes waiting to be served another drink or to be acknowledged as Christine continued to walk by us - never did she stop by and refilled us. We were not done with our food and she brings the hot towels and YET no drinks. We sit for another 15 min before she comes and brings us boxes to go. Still no refills or nothing. Then another 15 minutes before we got our check. She deserved the 60 cents I left her - yet she has the ordasity to run out to the door and thank us for coming in as to make us feel bad for no tipping? We all just laughed. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Killer BBQ in Henderson! I love their cucumber margarita and smoked tri tip dinner. The fried pickles are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Wow.  A lot of comments on this place.  I didn't have quite the variety of eats that others did as I came here really only to sample the BBQ.  

We ordered the meal for two, which is a special running perhaps for a limited time.  It came with 1/2 chicken, 8 ribs (St. Louis spares and Babys) and probably about 1/3 lb. of tri-tip.  Add to that a salad, 2 sides, and dessert.  All for $32.  From a value perspective it was a great deal.

I saw a review below that took issue to the reference to \"St. Louis\" style ribs.  Please inform yourself before you go all loco about this being a southern restaurant but St. Louis is north of the Mason-Dixon line.  FYI, St. Louis style spares typically refers to the cut of rib (you basically cut the riblets off the spare ribs), not how they are cooked or seasonings.  It would be like someone complaining about a New York strip steak being served in a French restaurant.  

Ok, now that I've gotten that off my chest...

Biscuits, salad, and sides (which we got vegetables and the peanut slaw) all rated C+/B-.  While I understand the sides aren't the most typical BBQ side fixins, we didn't want to go too overboard.  Hey, they are on the menu, they should be better.  The salad was your typical crappy house salad.  The biscuits were hockey pucks save for the sweet butter, but I don't think I could have handled greasy biscuits anyways.

Ribs - they use hickory to smoke which I'm never a fan of for pork, and I don't know if they use an commercial electric smoker or a wood burning pit (I'm guessing the former), but overall they were above average.  The babys were much better than the spares.  The spares really lacked a smoke ring or good smoke flavor, but the babys were very tasty and moist.  Spares were pretty dry, which is unusual considering spares are typically fattier.  Perhaps they don't move them as fast and they are \"held\" warm longer as another reviewer speculated.  But the bonus for me was the meat wasn't \"falling off the bone\".  Anybody who knows anything about good BBQ knows this is a sign of overcooked mushy ribs.  The meat held on the bone and a good tug cleaned the meat mostly off.  Finally someone knows how to cook ribs and stick to their guns with the doneness.   

The sauce kind of blew it for me.  Sooo sweet...tasted like a typical Kansas City style sauce.  I'll probably order them dry next time, and moreso to really get a sense of the flavor of the naked meat without the sauce killing the flavor.  I tasted the Memphis style sauce they had at the table, but other than the fact it was too thick, it had good Memphis tomatoey/vinegary flavor and lacked all of the sugar.  Overall I rate the ribs a B.

Chicken and tri-tip were really tasty.  The tri-tip was a tad dry, but certainly not enough to stop me from ordering it again.  I wouldn't call it a traditional Santa Maria-style tri-tip, but really good nonetheless.  Probably because it didn't have sauce coating it!  The hickory really complements beef much better.

The chicken was probably the highlight of the meal.  Both dark and white meat were cooked perfectly and were juicy.  The sauce was applied sufficiently so that it wasn't too sweet but added to the good flavor of the chicken.  I doubt they solely \"smoked\" the chicken, as doing so typically yields a rubbery skin, but they could have either cooked it over an open pit or did some sort of hybrid cooking method to give the skin a good texture while infusing some good smoke into the meat.  B+ for the tri-tip, A- for the chicken.

Finally, the desserts were mixed.  We ordered the peach cobbler and banana pudding.  The pudding was rich and thick and not too sweet, while the cobbler was pretty brutal.  They use dried peaches which were reconstituted, or at least that is what it tasted like.  It was a very commercial tasting cobbler.  C- for the cobbler, pudding was a B.

Overall service was good, and as mentioned good value.  I'm still going to cook my own ribs in my smoker and get a better product (and cheaper).  But for those days I don't feel like firing it up and want a fix, I'll go back for the chicken/tri-tip/baby backs.  

All in all, I wasn't overwhelmed, but this restaurant will please most BBQ fans but will leave the true die-hards wanting more.  Ya can't have it all (well, at least in Phoenix).  If anyone feels differently, let me know.  And don't mention the unholy Honey Bears."}
{"text":"Good service, wonderful location, Baby Ribs were fall off the bone succulent and the Jambayla was surprisingly spicy and better than expected."}
{"text":"Delicious!! My husband loved the beef ribs!  Brisket salad was perfect, large & tasty!  Service was friendly, fast, & informative!  Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here on two occasions recently.   Both experiences were great.  Food & service were fantastic."}
{"text":"What's the deal Lucille? Disappointing. I forgive those who 4 and 5 star the baby back ribs, for they simply don't know better. Kinda dry, kinda lacking a masterfully applied smokey flavor, kinda skinny on the meat, which would be forgivable, had they rocked in the flavor department. Skinny fries were good. Cold slaw decent, didn't suck, no wow factor either. I had to go find my own damn silverware and napkin. Not once did the server ask if I wanted a refill for my beverage. It was exactly what I expected, pure mediocrity across the board, including 90% of the half assed attempt of outsider folk art on the walls and watered down blues on the sound system. I would have never stepped foot here, but met my folks and their friends. Lucille, your meal did not appeal."}
{"text":"My friend recommended me to this place and I'm glad she did.  The service and food here was great!  I like to think I know good BBQ and I'd say this is top five for sure.  Joel was always my server/bartender and he was great.  There was also a manager?  that came around and made sure things were going smoothly and made sure everything came out right.   The food and Joel made this place great.  Next time I'm in town I'll be making a special trip"}
{"text":"Holy smokes this place has some good BBQ! I was in the neighborhood and stopped by on a coworkers recommendation. I had the tri-tip and baby back rib lunch combo. There was plenty of food and the service was excellent. I'll be back, SOON!"}
{"text":"Solid BBQ choice!

Ordered the baby backs...very tender and flavorful.  The sauce is super sweet, but after I dipped them in the \"spicy\" sauce, they because 10x better.  Don't worry, not very spicy...just has a lot more flavor than their default bbq sauce IMO.  The ribs earned a 4.5/5 in my book.  

The sides were not mind blowing...ordered the mac and cheese and the corn.  Didn't really hit it outta the park.  Would not order them again...The comp bread was good though!  The strawberry lemonade was super yum!

Also ordered the gumbo...it was pretty bland to tell you the truth.  Gumbo is supposed to be an explosion of spices and a little bit of heat, but this didn't do much for me at all.  Knocked off the extra star due to this...

The service was good and attentive, but the prices are pretty steep IMO.  I think my rack was $30.  Most of the other choices were in the high 20 range as well.  Good BBQ deserves good $$$, but I feel like everything was 10-20% higher than they should be.

I might be back, just won't be running back soon."}
{"text":"Lucille's seems to get better and better each time I go.  To this point, I've tried almost all of the meats...pulled pork, chicken, pork ribs, beef ribs, and chicken wings.

I would recommend the pork ribs over the beef.  The beef ribs are just massive and are a little tougher than the pork.

The appetizers are also top notch...wings, pickles, shrimp are all terrific.  I can't say for certain if they are a new addition, but the biscuits were amazing last time.  I don't recall them being as good in the past.  I have a feeling they might have switched things up, but whatever the case, beware of filling up on the biscuits.

If you aren't interested in having a quiet family experience I'd suggest sitting in the bar area.  About a half dozen TVs to catch whatever game is on and in some cases there will be live music.  Last visit there was a jam band of shorts but they were actually pretty good, really brought in that southern vibe.  I also believe that the happy hour drink and food specials are only good in the bar area, so all the more reason to sit there."}
{"text":"The building for this restaurant sets a great ambience. The service is very attentive. The menu is abundant and priced on the high side of competitive. There are gluten free options as well. The food is delicious. The portions for the dinner plates are large - possibly enough to split. The experience was very enjoyable. I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I work for a doctors office that is right down the street from Lucille's and we order from them multiple times a month. There is always little odds and ends that are wrong with our order but today, it was horrible. I waited a while after finally placing my order and my drug rep went to go pick up our order that we had ready for 1:30 pm, only to find out our order was never placed. And what makes it worse is that her name is Deb AND SHE IS THE GENERAL MANAGER OF LUCILLE'S BBQ!!!  When i called regarding it, she had NO IDEA what i was talking about. She told me that she takes the to go orders over the phone but does not remember taking mine.  that disgusts me that the GM cant place a to go order correctly. like i said i work for a doctors office. and we only have a certain amount of time and eat our lunch and have multiple different people pick up our to go order and bring it to our office. This enrages us because now we have nothing to eat for lunch. We will NEVER  be using this place again and will not recommend it either. If you ask me, Lucille's clearly needs a new General Manager"}
{"text":"Ok I am not a barbecue expert at all. We went on a whim wanting to try something new. The outside is cute and very unique, like going down South. The inside Has a lot of different rooms you can be seated in. We had to wait about 15 minutes, but they had chairs to sit on so you can be more comfortable.  The lunch prices aren't too bad, the menu is limited though.
 The night prices looked high to me, but meat in general is more expensive so that is understandable ( Plus I am kinda cheap :) ....
 I don't drink but the bar area was full and the people looked happy and comfortable in there.
 Worth a shot if you are in the Green Valley Ranch area."}
{"text":"First time here was a couple years ago, on the way back to the strip from driving through Red Rocks.  Food was great so when we took some friends through the Red Rocks drive we decided to stop in again  for lunch/dinner on the way back.

Food is excellent.  Burgers cooked the way they are ordered (I like MR).  Fries are hot and crispy outside, soft inside.  The baked beans are awesome.  And the Fried Green Tomatoes are to die for!  

Service was kind of slow on this trip, but we will come back again next time we are out that way."}
{"text":"I just left Lucille's and I thought I was in Austin, Texas. In Austin, people think \"The Salt Lick\" has the BEST Bar-B-Que, but Lucille's has them beat.
I am so glad i found Lucille's, I have missed not having Bar since I have been here in Las Vegas (and you can find also outside of one of the Big Hotel's)
The Customer Service is Outstanding and i should know (I was a trainer in CS)
Like me tell how wonderful and so welcome: Amy Kovarik and Alex the servers. The General Manager,Tanya Sanchez walks around and check on service and food, she want your experience their to be great. AND IT WAS!!!!
SO DON'T TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, PLEASE TRY THEM!!!
God Bless
Peggy"}
{"text":"I had the Texas Brisket, definitely was not what I was hoping for. I am a little biased but meat was rough and tasted more like flank steak. I understand this might not be one of their specialties so certainly can't judge them off of just one plate. Their mop sauce that came with brisket was average. However, their apple butter biscuits served before the meal were delicious. 

We sat in the bar, didn't have great service. Granted it was 3pm on a Sunday afternoon so they probably were short staffed. Everyone was very friendly, just had a hard time flagging anyone down to order/get our check. Might be a better idea to get a table. 

Very pricey- I am more than willing to pay for quality meat but that isn't what I had. We also had a Cajun shrimp salad. Shrimp was good, but was pretty much served on some iceberg lettuce. $50 tab in all for brisket plate, Cajun salad and 2 sweet teas. 

I give the ambiance an A+, really cool set up. 

Needless to say I will continue to search for great BBQ in the valley."}
{"text":"Just going to say food is really good, staff is polite. Will recommend to family and friends!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was because we got here on a Saturday night, but after waiting 50 minutes fir a table, one should not have to wait another 50 minutes just to place our food orders AND THEN another 50 minutes to actually get our food (to which they also forgot to give us sides that we ordered). I give them props for how the food tasted (a little better than mediocre).

Seriously though, the service was not existent and the food could have come out faster."}
{"text":"Went here 4th of July and it was packed! But what could you expect right. I've been wanting to try this place for a while but we rarely get out this way as its all the way in Green Valley and we live in N. LV...I had high hopes after being disappointed with the so-so bbq places such as Memphis and Famous Daves...Ughhh! Once we got in, our order came up pretty fast and lemme tell ya, it was worth the wait. I had the pulled pork, greens and macaroni.....Delish!!! Hubby had bbq shrimp which he loved and the kids also enjoyed their ribs & chicken. I also had a peach margarita which is the best I've had since...well ever! nly thing I didnt care for were the biscuits they bring out before dinner. They had sugar on top of them I think. Had a really weird taste and was very crumbly. I should've just asked for cornbread I guess....Oh well. Given the fact that we only had about 5 min to eat becuase our 1 yr old decided he wanted to be back outside, it was definetly worth it. I will most definetly be making a trip back out her soon!"}
{"text":"Last night we went to Lucilles to celebrate our sons birthday.  This isn't the first time we've been there and it won't be the last. We had the BBQ 1/2 chicken with 2 sides, 3 orders with different meats and my wife had the broiled Salmon?  Never been disappointed. Couple of weeks ago I had the whole rack of baby backs.  This place is rated as the best BBQ in Vegas and I totally agree as I've tried 4 other BBQ restaurants.  Last night LAHELA was our waitress and she rated 5 stars.  Very attentive to our table as well as others around us. Service has never been a problem but last nights was exceptional. Can't wait till our next visit and I'll be sure to ask for her as our waitress."}
{"text":"I was craving some bar-b-que, some real good smoked meat and they delivered! I'm not a fan of many chain restaurants but I gave them a shot. Friendly service, good beer and good meat.

I ordered the sample lunch special, your choice of one rib and two other meats plus a side. I had the beef ribs, hot link and brisket. The sauce on the ribs was good, sweet, tangy and tender meat. The link had a great spicy kick and not at all greasy. Brisket could be cut with a fork and great with one of their custom sauces available at each table. Their pale ale was a bit hoppy but most micro brews are. I tried the fried pickles, the batter was light and tasty but I wasn't a big fan. The potato salad and peanut coleslaw were excellent sides so all in all this was a great meal.

Lunch special prices were very good. I hope to return and check out their live music sometime soon."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriends just came back from the theater and needed some food! They told me about this place, and were so excited for me to try it. I love Bar-B-Que food! No way I was saying no!

We got seated quickly and the TV's had the typical sports on it. :( 
Our waiter was nice and let us have a right amount of time to over look our menu. The drink glasses were huge! I was not going to bother my server for a refill.. 

The only complaint about this restaurant was it was way to COLD. They had the A/C blasting... my hair was waving in the wind and all. 

I couldn't wait to eat to get warmed up..

BBQ Tri Tip was my choice.
Angus Beef tri tip, and served with the savory mop sauce. The food looked good, and tasted good. Meat was tender, so you know they were cooking it for hours. Loved it! 

Another amazing BBQ restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que was a blast!  This is the kind of restaurant you go to with family or close friends, roll up your sleeves and eat with your hands.  The restaurant has a playful, laid back feel; the servers are friendly; and the portions are generous.

Four of us shared a Full Rack of Baby Back Ribs and a Full Rack of St. Louis Ribs with extra sides--just a few dollars more for each.  We left stuffed and very satisfied.  The ribs were pull-of-the-bone-tender, flavorful, and not dripping with sauce--which we liked.  There are 3 bottles of Lucille's BBQ Sauce on the table ranging from spicy to sweet for you to add more sauce if that's your thing.  Memorable add-ons/sides were the Caesar Salad, Mac 'n Cheese, and Mashed Potatoes, I would skip the Coleslaw (undressed) and Baked Beans (too sweet, lots of sauce, not a lot of beans), and don't fill-up on the House Biscuits (heavy and dense).

There are plenty of options on the fairly large menu, including pasta, sandwiches, jambalaya, and salad, if someone in your group doesn't like BBQ, but when the restaurant is called Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que, you can guess what your best bet is going to be.  If you're not going to grill at home, come down to Lucille's and let them do the work for you."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ! This place is giving Phil's a run for their moneyyy in terms of sauces. First of all, the restaurant was huge and really clean. Our waitress was really nice! She even explained the 3 different type of sauces available &general info about Lucille's. She started us off with freshly baked biscuits. These were no ordinary biscuits though. Some may argue that the bread was \"hard\" but I felt that it was necessary to have them a bit sturdy rather than having them fall apart. It had butter and some type of sugar? on top. Not sure what it was but it was something different and definitely tasty! Their sweet tea was good too, all their drinks were served in mason jars btw, so hipsters rejoice. Also note that they do serve their drinks in shareable portions. 

Onto the food: We got the \"BBQ Lunch Platter\" [$16]. Came with baby back ribs (3 bones, normal or St. Louis rub) AND \"your choice of two of the following: pulled pork, brisket burnt ends, tri tip, hot link, rib tips or one quarter smoked chicken\" (from the website) PLUS a side. I opted with the normal baby back ribs- juicy and fall of the bones type- & brisket as well as tri tip. All great choices! Their mac & cheese was cheeeesy just the way I like it. Tasted their potato salad too, Phil's won in that department by a long shot. Now in terms of sauces, Phil's has more of the tangy-spicy taste whereas Lucille's has the tangy-sweet taste which I liked better.. In terms of size & tenderness, I feel like Phil's is better. IN CONCLUSION: They're both great BBQ places (:"}
{"text":"Our server was really good.. The food was good. 
But 2 things were outstanding : strawberry lemonade and the box of toothpicks"}

We ordered a full rack of baby back ribs which were excellent.  The side of mashed potatoes, and cole slaw were very good. The biscuits and butter were also fine.
Al and all one of ther best ribs we have ever had."}
{"text":"Lucilles is a pretty great place for beef ribs!!! 
I mean if you can't get to Phils barbecue because they're located in California - YUM YUM!!
Then  Lucilles is your next best place to eat beef ribs!!"}
{"text":"Really good. Saw good reviews on yelp, so thought we'd try it. Glad we did! Jambalaya and pulled pork salad both really good AND gluten free! Friendly attentive staff and good service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Do i really have to review Lucilles.. well here we go this location is in the Red Rock Casino and its a bigger place than the green valley location. As far as food goes theres only a couple things that i look forward to when i eat here.
Beef Ribs & St Louis Ribs and sometimes when im really hungry ill order a mardi gras chicken to go. The biscuits and apple butter is always a great bite.
 The only bad side is the smoking from the casino does come into the dining room so i guess that will be the reason i go to green valley over this location. but food is always consistent"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again. Came in with my family after church today because my husband wanted BBQ. First off it was 11 AM and the place had just opened and yet they parked us in a booth by the kitchen. Before we could even strap our baby into the high chair and sit down the waitress was hovering over us wanting to get our drink orders. Now some might take this as a sign of fast customer service, but that was it...totally rushed and overwhelmed. Not very Southern or hospitable. She gets our drink orders and brings my 5 year old back a huge open mason jar for a drink instead of a kids cup. Meanwhile she had stinky attitude the whole time. We open the overwhelmingly large menus and my eyes almost pop out of my head at the prices. So we order our overpriced plates and no sooner then we get them she's dropping off the dessert menu. Mind you...there are few patrons as it is still quite early. So we don't finish our food because of the large portions which makes me feel better about the pricing so I'm boxing up my food and my toddler accidentally knocks my catfish on the floor. My husband and I are scrambling to pick it up and the waitress just stands there looking at us. Doesn't offer to help, doesn't ask if I want to replace it. Just too busy trying to cash us out. I've never felt so robbed in my life. Take your $80 to the grocery store and feed your family for a week before taking them to this sham of a family establishment."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner to celebrate Mother's Day.  We made a reservation for 5pm for 5 adults and 1 high chair for a child.  We were sat immediately up arrival despite the crowd waiting. What I was disappointed with was that, although I expected it to be busy, they crammed 3 large males and 2 females and a baby in a high chair onto a table that would normally seat 4 people. The highchair they provided was so dirty and had old food stuck to it, we had to scrub it down with baby wipes and used one of their cloth napkins to clean it off before I put my baby in it.  It was disgusting really.  It took awhile to get our drinks however once we ordered the food came out promptly.  We ordered the backyard feast. The menu says it feeds 4 however there was 6 of us and we still took home leftovers. The ribs were good and the mac n cheese was delicious. Garlic mashed potatoes were killer however the bbq beans were a little too sweet for my taste.  This huge feast however was just a reminder of how crammed we were on that table.  We barely had room for our drinks and plates, making it very uncomfortable to eat.  My suggestion would be to not accept so many reservations at one time and just crowd people in. Sacrificing customer service and comfortability for sales?!  I still gave it a 4 star because the food was great and service was good. We will go back again. We already said we will just pad 2 additional people on the reservation and just say they didnt show ;)"}
{"text":"Best part of the evening was our fantastic, friendly and funny server! Service was great - seated quickly, attentive but not annoying server, quick food. 

Food was ok. Salad with \"mixed greens\" was really iceburg lettuce with some chicken and bbq sauce on it. Beef tips were ok but chewy."}
{"text":"Dined outside on 10/13. We had a great meal!! The burnt tips app and fried green tomatoes were perfect starters. I had the blackened chicken sandwich and it was everything I had hoped for and more! So glad we stopped in and will make it a point to return very soon!"}
{"text":"Mind-boggling rhetorical question of the day: Who on earth chooses to have their bachlorette party dinner at Lucille's? 

My down home girlie girl, who, bless her sweet heart and wonderbread palate, absolutely adores this joint. 

To start, the service was absolutely atrocious. Party of eight on a Friday night. Annoying? I can see how it could be. More annoying? Losing the reservation and shoving us into a corner designed to seat five, maybe six max. A bunch of elbow bumping, scantily clad chicks all dolled, sipping fruity ass hurricanes and the like. Probably pretty humorous to observe. Not so humorous to navigate.

Put on your woo-girl face though because this is a par-tay! Woo!

Bring out the mildly scandalous goodie bags filled with penis lollipops, dirty fortune cookies and flavored lube (i.e. the tame stuff). Just scandalous enough send your Great Aunt Esther into a conniption fit. Seriously, if this was the genuine highlight of this meal, it really does not speak highly of the hot garbage being slopped on a plate at Lucille's. Woo!

And we wait, and wait, and wait. 

Bread, finally! Woo!

Wait, are you sure you didn't confuse biscuits with hard tack? Because not even the scrumptious honey butter you've got is worth the dental bills incurred from teething this rock. 

Again we wait, and wait, and wait. 

Pulled pork! Woo!

Hold up. How does a pulled pork sandwich manage to be incredibly greasy and dry as a bone at the same time? Have I slipped into some alternative dimension? Is it opposite day? Because if so, this shit is finger-lickin' good. You best slop on that BBQ sauce to add some semblance of flavor to the sandwich and hope it doesn't soak through the bun in 2.5 seconds flat. Worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever eaten. Hands down. The garlicky mashed potatoes as a side were the only saving grace of the meal.

I seriously have no idea how this place stays in business. If it were not for the over abundance of low swingin' crotch fruit I brought to the party, dinner here would have tanked, hard and fast. It was awkward, drawn out (3 hours!) and ridiculously expensive. The best part about the experience was walking out the door. Woo!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Lucille's. The service is still nice/ok. The food was better the first time. However the quality of the food has decreased. My meal was mediocre at best. The best thing about our meal was the peach lemonade. I'm somewhat disappointed."}
{"text":"I just called to confirm a reservation for this week. Unfortunately, the online platform didn't save the reservation, but this place has the friendliest staff who were really quick to apologize and assist me with making a new reservation! Cannot wait to go, and thank you so much for being patient with me!"}
{"text":"Had a few good experiences here, really enjoyed it. They have great teas too. About a year ago, I got very bad food poisoning after ordering the tri-tip salad (which was not even tasty whilst consuming)."}
{"text":"Absolute blast!! Our first visit and all the food was incredible!!! From pulled pork sandwiches, tri-tip, brisket to all the sides; everything was very good.  Our party of 8 enjoyed the meal and the beautiful of the outdoor water display and Palm trees.  We will return again."}
{"text":"Enter hungry....leave like your 9 months pregnant!  

I always love the food @ Lucilles.  Arrived @ 630pm and the place was packed!! There was a 45 min. wait for a table for 2.  I was craving Lucilles so we started to wait.  After waiting for 10minutes..I went into the bar and snagged a table (bar area is self seating) as soon as a couple had left.

Our server was very very friendly.  There was about 5 min left for happy hour and she made sure to hook us up!
Of course...we started w/ alcohol!!!

We got the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer.  Ive never really had them before and have been wanting to try them..and these did not disappoint!!  There were lightly battered and fried and served w/ some type of sauce that just completed the dish.

For my main entree I ordered their Fried Chicken w/ garlic mashed potatoes and veggies.  Everything was awesome!  

After eating here...I was sooo stuffed and bloated!!   There is just so much food on the the plates!!!  If you have to take breaks while you eat the food on your plate then you know thats a lot of food!
Very good food~~!!"}
{"text":"The service here is remarkable, also highly recommend the lemonade and ice tea. The atmosphere is wonderful and food is delicious."}
{"text":"So yeah, I've eaten at Lucille's many times but never had a \"wow\" meal until tonight.  We were hanging up at the Red Rock playing some poker and decided it was time to grab a bite and go home.  

The hubs and I aren't crazy BBQ fans but on occasion we are down for some Southern cookin.  We decided we'd place an order at their convenient takeout counter located towards the front of the hotel (just so you have a reference point) and go home so we could binge watch and get fat together!

There was some mad crazy live music going on as the takeout counter is near the bar.  The big guy had a great voice and was fun, meaning he was getting the crowed included.  It was way to freaking loud though. Like hello....I'm trying to place my order here, ya'll!  Anyway let's get to how friendly the girl was who took my order.  I had to wait for a guy in front of me who was having payment issues then I had to wait for her to take a phone in order.  Finally it was MY turn! Hallelujah!  

The order was simple.  Hubs wanted jambalaya and said it was AWESOME!  He's not so easy to please to this means a lot!  I wanted the southern fried chicken but I didn't want to deal with bones.  Guess what!???  It doesn't come with bones! It's 2 gigantic chicken breasts lightly fried and covered in gravy!  Amazing!  It was perfectly prepared.  Since this was a to go order everything came on the side.  That was great so nothing got soggy.  I asked for a baked potato instead of the garlic mashed and I'm happy I did.  That baker was so good! I asked for extra gravy, they obliged!  The entire order was prepared exactly as I had ordered and tasted so good!  Lucille's, you've out done yourself!  We will be back or better yet, we may be doing UberEATS!  

Thank you for an incredible meal!"}
{"text":"Best baby back pork ribs ever! had it 3 times already. love the sides and portions, too. the complimentary biscuit basket makes me want to savor it forever because it's so different! comes with a mildly sweet butter with some sort of a warm and welcoming essence to it. servers AND the to-go booth employees are nice!"}
{"text":"Had a bad experience last time, and though this was better, the food just wasn't up to par with the Lucille's that first opened. My kid's chicken tenders were tiny and cost 8$. My sandwich was OK, it was piled way to thick to pick up and despite being juicy it did not have enough BBQ flavor. The mac n cheese had no flavor of cheese. The biscuits were very crunchy. The red Velvet cake frosting tasted of freezer burn. All in all I just can no longer recommend coming here. :("}
{"text":"It was my first time at a Lucille's and I ordered Pop's Beloved Fresh Pan Blackened Catfish with garlic mashed potatoes and braised greens, right off the menu.  Flavorful, and well-prepared, the food was good.  The service, however, was horrible.  Yes, it was a Friday night, and it was crowded, but that's no excuse.  Inside of a Las Vegas Casino, the service should never be bad.  If the kitchen can keep up, the service staff should be able to also.  If the service had been better, I would have given it 5 stars.  It's a chain BBQ restaurant after all, and the food could have been only marginal, but again, it was good.  I would go back again.  Maybe they were just having an off night."}
{"text":"After a so-so experience at the Vegas location, I was asked by the owners to give them another shot.  The Vegas experience was tainted by service, not the quality or flavor of the food.  I thought it would be years before I was back in a town with a Lucille's, but just a couple months later, a trip to Phoenix gave me another opportunity.  I visited the Tempe Marketplace Lucille's.  The service was fantastic!  Kudos to the waitstaff.  They actually worked as a team, each helping the other when needed.  The food was good, but the baby backs I had tonight were not as good as the blacked fish I had in Vegas.  Guess I shoulda stuck with the fish.  However this restaurant has redeemed itself, and when I have the chance, I will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant did not disappoint. It was amazing service and the food was delicious. I had the tritip and the bf had the combo. Also, the banana pudding was awesome!"}
{"text":"Ah, BBQ. Having lived in Garland, TX as a kid, I linger for good BBQ. And Lucille's has just that. Their Baby Back Ribs are superb. I have a weak spot for their BBQ Brisket sandwiches (topped with their Original BBQ Sauce!). Oh, and their Pulled Pork Sandwich is something special. I love their baked beans. The service is usually impeccable (avoid weekends, though, and you won't worry about wait times)."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. My complaint is with management. A very minor substitution request was denied. It would have taken no extra effort from staff and the cook staff was familiar with my request as it was on the menu in dinner size and used to be available in lunch size. So much for the customers being right!"}
{"text":"I'm kinda scared to let the secret out, but I guess Yelp deserves to know - The Happy Hour at Lucille's ROCKS. It's in the bar area only, but on Monday when we went the restaurant was full and the bar area was half empty... no clue why. 

It's 4-7 PM M-F, and 9 PM - close daily. We ordered a disgusting amount of food and 2 22 oz drinks, all for $40 with tax and tip. Cocktails start at just $3.25 (I believe our 22 oz backporch strawberry lemonades were $4.25), and food was priced from $2-$6. 

Hot link ($1.95) 
Riblets ($5.95)
Gumbo ($4.95)
Irish Fries ($2.95)
Sliders (2 for $3.95)

The winner for me was the sliders (your choice of pork brisket or chicken!), but the irish fries were a nice surprise - huge platter of yummy skinny fries topped with cheese and sour cream and other goodies. The gumbo was AWFUL (my family is from NOLA so I'm picky!). Overall great food, great drinks, great prices. We can finally afford to eat at Lucille's more often !"}
{"text":"Great food , wonderful service , Sieanna was very attentive , polite and a perfection of efficiency.
The shrimp and catfish was very tasteful and cooked to perfection , the fried pickles are a wonderful treat, the Big easy BBQ shrimp was a tasteful delight.
We have been here before and have never been disappointed, will return ."}
{"text":"This is a HUGE BBQ restaurant - maybe 8000sf? I have liked just about everything I've ever ordered here though, which is odd for a big chain restaurant. Their staff is consistently attentive and the food quality is above par. Not a lot of other BBQ options in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"I'm from the south, Mississippi to be exact and I can say they were pretty good, the flavor of the greens were superb. I tried the dish called the blackened catfish platter, only thing that I did not like we're the mash potatoes, were a bit bland. The biscuits they serve as well were flaky, and soft. Overall this place deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was very good as usual.  The atmosphere was fun and causal.  Service was ok to good since it was busy and we had a party of 11.  Ordered the Feast, and still had tons of food left over.  Overall, solid BBQ and southern food."}
{"text":"Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que is one of the best ones out here in Vegas located at Red Rock Hotel and Casino. Their happy hour is simply amazing and the variety is much better than the one in Green Valley. I do have to say though the only thing that this location likes is space in the bar area where happy hour does take place I think they need to add any more seats in order for more people to enjoy the happy hour in this location."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats and I have to say the Tri Tip is amazing! Mac n cheese also good, not too cheesy more just creamy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!
We started out with the fried pickles and I was a little worried when they told me they were spears as those tend to get soggy. Thankfully they were crispy and delicious and stayed crispy the whole time!
Then we split the Mardi Gras chicken because we heard it was huge. With two people with big appetites we didn't even come close to finishing all of it! The chicken was flavorful and crispy.
Now, to get onto the main star of the show... The biscuits! I am not normally a biscuit fan but oh my god these were like heaven. They come out warm with sugar on top and are served with a apple cinnamon butter. I could eat just these and be incredibly happy!

We will definitely be back! Food was great and the servers were attentive and really nice!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and attentive. The menu was diverse and had a lot of items I enjoy. The ribs are not as good or as tender as other places, the mac and cheese is alright. The salmon salad was very good as the fish was seasoned and cooked well."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for lunch.  Had the BBQ sampler lunch with pulled pork, beef brisket, and pork ribs.  The brisket stood out amongst the meats and was very good.  The pork stuff was not that impressive.  Overall I felt the food was not great for the price.  Had a beer at the bar while I waited which was very cool.  Decor to entertain."}
{"text":"Not sure if they are use to reservations, but we had made one at 6:30. We ended up getting sat at 7:15. That being said the walk-up wait was an hour and a half. 
       Food was good and service was just OK... They had placed us  in a corner and we didn't receive much attention although our group really didn't need any so that was good.
       I had the Cajun shrimp with rice and vegetables. Somewhat underwhelming. Supposedly 1/2 pound of shrimp. I'll definitely pick something else next time I go.
      On the bright side, the restaurant has very cool decor/ambience!"}
{"text":"Havent been to a lucilles since leaving so. Cal. This place make me feel like im back home. Beer was cold and served very promptly. Jess and McKenzi were awesome. I will definately be back."}
{"text":"After reading all the good reviews on yelp we decided to hit up this place for some lip smacking BBQ. 

We all feasted on the family plan of ribs, chicken and 4 sides. We opted for a complete revolt of health conscience eating with mac and cheese, garlic mashed potatoes, grilled corn, and baked beans. We also ordered their fried pickles-yum! 

There are mixed reviews overall for this place from myself and the group I was with. The ribs served to us in our family style meal were kinda burnt overall-some were juicy and moist and some just had some extra sauce slapped on like lipstick on a pig. As a contrast my nephew got the child's plate of 3 ribs and his were all thick, moist and juicy-very succulent looking in comparison. Strange, eh?

The sides were extremely sub-par. I would say if you are coming here don't even bother with the corn, I am pretty sure it was previously frozen because the husk was soggy. The mac and cheese was alright, but tasted like it was made with something along the lines of Velveeta. The chicken was good, juicy and perfectly cooked.

Also a plus is for those crazy enough to want to sit outside-there are misters to help keep you cool."}
{"text":"This place was one of the best BBQ places i have ever been to. The lemonade was great as well! I had this amazing brisket sandwich. the beef was soft tender and almost melted in my mouth. I loved this place so much that i asked them if they had any locations in Cali. Which they do! just not that close to me. The next time i am in Vegas this place is a must for me!

also our waiter rocked! totally knew the menu in and out and explained what we would like based on what kind of food we told him we liked. he was spot on with his recommendations."}
{"text":"Great service, little.. just a little pricey  if you compare to places like chillies etc..for two ppl it was 42 and change but let me say that it was way more worth then that(see picture)...that fish melted n my mouth and  was spicy enough..loved the environment.."}
{"text":"I know this is a chain, but, good bbq is good bbq. I appreciated the lack of gristle & fat on the brisket & ribs. I didn't even need extra sauce on the meat. Watermelon tea was a delight but the peach lemonade was suuuuuuper sweet & I probably wouldn't order it again. Is on the pricier end of the wallet spectrum, but the smell of the place alone is worth it."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to eat here as apparently on live music night the only table we could get would have been in the bar area where the music is. Don't want my dinner to be loud music the entire time making a conversation at the table impossible. Walked out when they said no other tables available and went next door to Yard House."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends. Was my first time! We shared the wings and fried pickles as an appetizer together. The fried pickles were huge! They used spear pickles. Which was a first for me because I'm used to seeing pickle chips haha. Their wings were extremely good. Huge portion for just an appetizer too! They were nice and juicy, the sauce has so much flavor.

Even the main dishes were huge! The portions are so huge here, you can easily share 1 dish with 2 or 3 people. Which is what one of my friends and I decided to do. We ordered the BBQ chicken & 2 meats (burnt ends & rib tips). For our sides, we got Mac & chz & cole slaw. The chicken was so juicy & fall off the bone tender. The burnt ends and rip tips really hit the spot for me. Again, really tender! Plus they have a few different in house BBQ sauces to choose from which made it even better! Their Mac & chz & Cole slaw were very good as well.

The reason I gave this place 3 stars was because service was almost horrible. We got here at 730pm for dinner. We all were starving since we haven't eaten since noon that day. The restaurant was about 30% full the whole time we were there. Our server didn't pay much attention to our table. We sat down and it took him 10 mins just to order our drinks and about another almost 15 mins to bring us our drinks and take our order. Never came to give us refills. And never checked on us after our food arrived and took a day and a half to bring the checks."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain restaurant, but oh my is it awesome. We ordered a full rack of ribs that was about a two feet long. It was incredible. The barbeque was generally Kansas City style, everything was served \"wet\" (cooked with the sauce on it already). Very good BBQ, outdoor seating, a very LARGE jar of muddy water (arnold palmer)...can't really be beat. Good escape from The Strip if you're a visitor. Plus you can check out the Green Valley Ranch, which is a really nice Casino next door. Service was average, prices were pretty good for a good BBQ joint.

Went there on a Saturday night once and they had a live blues band. They were enjoyable, if not a little too loud on the volume (it's not a rock concert and the bar is tiny!). This is a good bet for BBQ if the mood the strikes you."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and I'm one picky girl!!! Some of the best service I've had by server Caprice as well as service from manager Travis . Had a great experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let me set the standard for this review that it's for TAKE OUT ONLY. I have witnessed nothing but positive service while dining in. This isn't the first bad takeout experience but we chose to give them the benefit of the doubt. I called in to order because their online service was down. When I called in I was asked to hold to be transferred to the takeout desk. I sat on hold for 5 minutes and hung up because no one at the take out desk had ever come on the line. When I called back I was asked to hold this time and I obliged. When the gentlemen came back on the line he asked for my number and began to place my order. I ordered a bbq bacon burger medium with beans, a kids rib with beans, a 1/2 order of the southern chicken strips Well done or crispy to which the gentlemen replied \"okay well done i'll make sure to tell them\" and a large fry. He repeated the order back to me and then asked if I wanted complementary apple butter and biscuits. I said yes. He asked if I wanted plates and utensils. I said yes. He asked if I wanted extra bbq sauce and listed off the three types. I said original, yes please. Throughout the entire conversation he was friendly and kept saying things like awesome awesome, right on, you got it etc etc. He gave me my total and said 20-25 minutes. When picking up the order my mother noticed that my chicken was not well done or crispy nor did it say so. She asked the cashier for my chicken to be recooked. Side note I always ask for chicken crispy or well done after getting not cooked chicken enough times before. The cashier (male) said he had to get a manager. The manager agreed to get the chicken taken care of but was not apologetic or friendly at all. The chicken came out well after this and they did give me extra, however my fries were then barely filled and we paid for a large side of fries. I gave up at this point. Upon leaving my mother noticed their was no bbq sauce in there like requested. We had waited 35 minutes at this point between picking up original orders and recooking and the cashier (male) decided to throw some serious attitude at her for asking for some. His response was \"well did you ask for some\". It's very frustrating to see such a place give such attitude and disrespect to customers who are very frequent. I'll probably second guess coming here at all any longer if you don't want to accommodate your guests. As a further side note the manger radioed the cashier (male) that we dealt with the entire time (just not sure if it was him on the phone) and asked him if he had been asked for well done chicken. He lied. I have a huge problem with people not holding themselves accountable especially over something so small. It's not like your job would be in question over this. I believe the manager should've followed through on making sure this order was completed accurate afterwards and should've been a more apologetic and personable human. I believe the cashier shouldn't have ever copped an attitude with my mother and should be talked to regarding this. My family comes from a background of hospitality and this was anything but in our experience today."}
{"text":"Lucilles is amazing! Service, ambiance and most of all food! All the meat has a deep smoky taste. Sides are good too, and drinks.
A really special place, we had a fantastic meal and will be back again and again!
They give you a hot rag at the end of service,so cool!
I recommend Lucilles highly!"}
{"text":"My wife and I started coming to this location a couple of years ago. We weren't ever going to come back because the service was absolutely terrible. They always over seat the place and you were lucky to get your water refilled. After a few months we went back because of a gift card. We decided to sit at the bar for happy hour and now we both really enjoy the place. The bartenders (Sarah and Chilla especially) are always friendly and make excellent drinks. If it wasn't for the bar service this would be a 1 star review."}
{"text":"Went to Lucille's today to use our gift card from a prior mediocre experience.  

Justin was our waiter, he was funny, fast, and friendly.  Probably the best service we've had at Lucille's.

We each got a burger, I got the Lucille's cheeseburger and my wife got the mushroom burger.  Both were cooked as ordered and served hot.  The flavor was terrific, had a great smoked burger flavor that is lacking in quite a few burgers from even supposed \"burger\" places.  And they don't skimp on the toppings either - both burgers were nice and sloppy - just the way we like 'em!

Justin kept our drinks stocked and was on top of everything - a great problem solver.

Will definitely go back to Lucille's!"}
{"text":"My server was friendly but I was not in the mood for a lot of talk.   He wanted to explain everything since it was my first visit.  This was not my first rodeo in a Que restaurant so I didn't need to hear how long the meat was smoked \"longer than other places\".  First, I ordered a frozen strawberry Margarita - I sent it back because there was barely a strawberry taste.  I then ordered the Back Porch Strawberry Lemonade.  They need to add more strawberries to their strawberry drinks.  Next, came the biscuits with apple butter - great but it is not your traditional southern apple butter.  I had the 7oz brisket - it was served in one inch rectangles and not slices.  It was good but it still had fat.  It was easy to remove.  However, I could not taste the smoke.  Maybe it should be smoked much longer than other other places.  On the table there are three types of sauces - Memphis, original, and hot & spicy.  Except for the Memphis, the other too were watery but good.  The bake beans were delicious.  For the price I was expecting much more.  I will try and find a Que joint instead of a Que restaurant next time."}
{"text":"Always good food and service. Love their ice tea in mason jars. $100 gift cards on sale at Costco for $69 !!!"}
{"text":"Wow...the biscuit with apple butter appetizer is amazing. The atmosphere is great and so is the food. The chicken is by far the best of the meats. The warm wash cloth at the end seals the deal."}
{"text":"BBQ has to be one of my favorite foods and when a co worker suggested this place I was all for it.  Living on the west side it was quite the drive but being that I am a BBQ fanatic I had to see what this was all about.  

First off Lucille's has a good location.  Its located by Dave and Buster in the Tempe Marketplace.  The look of the place is gimmicky but in a Famous Dave's kinda way.  They have old school signs, mason jars to drink out of, and all the little fake things to make you seem like you have gone to Memphis or where ever they are trying to transport you.

The service was absolutely awful.  It took way to long to get drinks and even longer to get refills.  Attitude the whole time.  Here is a tip if you want a good tip bust your butt.  Then you will have more money to pay for your tuition (half the staff is college kids).  And do not roll your eyes when I don't want to try your suggestions.  They tell you they smoke all their meats in house im not impressed.  

Now onto the most important part the BBQ.  We had the brisket,half chicken and rib tips with a side of greens and sweet potato fries. 

The chicken was good.  It had a smoke on it and was tender not real complaints.  The portion size was good.

Brisket was dry and you couldn't cut it with a fork.  That tough.  Maybe over smoked?  Portion size tiny.  4 strips maybe 3 or 4 inches long.

Rib Tips were dry and covered in sauce.  Hardly any meat on them.  Most places in the valley load you up on Rib Tips when you order they are a cheap meat.  But not this place.  You get a scoop full.  Boo.

Collard greens were disgusting.  Cooked in some weird pork parts and they were bitter.  Greens are not supposed to be bitter if cooked right!

Sweet Potato Fries.  You can't really mess these up they probably came frozen.  So I would recommend these over regular fries.

The starter of a biscuit with sugar on top was just weird.  WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  And the biscuit wasn't even warm enough to melt the sugar I mean apple butter. 

One last thing the house and spicy BBQ sauce's main ingredients are CORN SYRUP thats how they thicken it! seriously that should tell you something.

Overall two thumbs down.  Stay away there are plenty of other great BBQ spots in the valley."}
{"text":"lucilles is probably the best chain bbq place...  i have a fave mom and pop bbq place as well...  

lucilles is in the district... and its a hit and miss when u will find a crowd and have to wait for a seat... but the foods worth it.

to start off i have the backyard lemonade... its a great sweet alcoholic drink when its 100 degrees outside.  its pink and comes in a huge mayo type jar...to go with that southern feel.

the gluttony starts when you sit down... thy serve these wonderful biscuits with a honey butter it is so sinful.... i have to limit myself to only one or else i can't eat my meal.

fried green tomatoes... fabulous! the sauce that comes with it.. really brings it together.

my favorite meats here are the half chicken and the tri tip.  the chicken is always moist and juicy and taste good even the next day. lol... the tri tip is melt in your mouth delicious.
I've tried the ribs. brisket. and pulled pork before and i don't care too much for it... a little dry.

the sides are all relish! mac and cheese...classic and creamy.
collars greens...my fave!! cooked well and has a lot of smoke from the ham hock.
corn on the cob...mmm a whole cob of corn.
sweet potato mash was more like dessert than anything... very good but very very sweet.
I've never had dessert here bc im always too full."}
{"text":"Avoid this place! Literally just got off the phone with these people. Called and asked if I could make a reservation and spoke with a gentleman for Father's Day. Before he could finish His sentence some angry lady in the background stared screaming \" we aren't taking any reservations for this day \" ... jeez talk about hating your job.. never will go here again."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than BBQ, I mean nothing!  This place is just too busy at times.  If you have the patience, wait.  The BBQ is worth the wait.  I usually don't eat french fries, but I devoured these."}
{"text":"Jess the bartender is awesome, it's been a blast hanging out until our movie started. It's off the market place strip but a hella of a lot better than thirsty lion or that Japanese place.

Reverse happy hour is amazing, we never knew about it!
 But now that we do, we'll hit this place up anytime we are here at the Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"We love this place as a family restaurant. But please, take Savion off of host duties. No personality and doesn't care about helping you."}
{"text":"Good food! Great seasonings and meat is cooked amazingly. Too pricey for my liking but none the less didn't regret my decision"}
{"text":"Two-stars is all I can conjure up for Lucille's and that's because the food was pretty good. What else is there, you might ask? Well, our server did an extraordinarily POOR job.  We've eaten here before and were never particularly impressed with either the food or the service, but we ate here for our anniversary. We ordered one of their big salads and the two-meat dinner platter.  Both dinners were $$$, but good - the brisket burnt ends and the baby back ribs were  tender and tasty, and the sides were equally good.  It was not busy (week night) when we were there, but for some reason our server pretty much ignored us for the entire meal. She presented us with the check without asking if we wanted dessert (we did), she never refilled our drinks (I finally asked at the end and she took my glass, but never returned with my drink - we asked a passing server and a to-go glass of tea showed up a bit later), and after desert was served and an extended time had passed we had to ask for the check again!  When you're paying a premium price for dinner, one expects the service to be a cut above average.  In this case it was several cuts below average.  I was really disappointed in the service and although the food was pretty good, it didn't match the cost. We probably won't be back until we forget about this experience. . ."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a recent trip to Red Rock hotel, decided to try their fried chicken. When the meal was presented, I wasn't sure what it was exactly.  I was visualizing a typical fried chicken dinner with pieces of breast or drumstick or whatever....nope, this was more of a  chicken cutlet. Like, laying  flat on the plate.   Not really what I had in mind, but whatever.  So, just be aware  that if you order the fried chicken at Lucile's , that's what you get.  It came with a cream gravy which was okay....nothing special though.  The chicken was crispy but not hugely flavorful.  Finished the meal with the banana pudding for dessert.  Not bad, but not great either.  Overpriced for what it was, but that's pretty much the way things are these days, especially in casino restaurants.  Just \"meh\".  Maybe next time I'll order bbq."}
{"text":"First time.to try artichoke - way too much work. LOVE the watermelon tea - yes, watermelon tea!  Excellent  risket and wonderful bread pudding.  We were told to ask any staff in a black shirt for anything.  No need, everyone was attentive.  Clean silverware and nice bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Only gave 4 stars because of the wait, but it was the dinner rush so I understand.  Ordered the fried okra and was happy. They were crispy and not soggy at all! Had the portobello beef brisket sandwich. It was great, but a little too much bread so finished it without the bread.  Let's be honest I'm not picking if that's my only complaint. Mom and daughter shared a half slab of baby backs and they were licking their chops! Wife had brisket sandwich and she was licking the plate!  Bottom line there was a whole lot of finger licking and a whole little chit chat!  This was my second visit and I love it just a as much as the first time!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is: If you haven't tried this place, you have been missing out. 

My boyfriend & I are big fans of Memphis BBQ, but now that I've been to Lucilles...I'm grappling with the harsh reality that I may not return to Memphis...jk, we still love you Memphis! 

The sides were JUST as wonderful as the entree, how often does that really happen?"}
{"text":"Can't believe I've never had this place before but, in pregnancy, my appetite and taste buds bring me to uncharted territory. 

I loved (most of) the food here. The biscuits and sweet butter fulfilled cravings I didn't even know I had. The barbecue chicken sandwich (complete with onion straws) was amazing. The corn on the cob was nothing spectacular. 

The service was great. They use a sort of team approach so you can get anything you need from anyone who happens to be walking by. Multiple people checked on us, cleared dirty plates, and filled our drinks. We were impressed. 

I have a feeling a craving will hit for some barbecue very soon and I'll return here often!"}
{"text":"First time here. Late lunch birthday party. Nice atmosphere. Probably ordered the wrong thing. Rice bowl looked like someone went through it already. Not presentable. Appetizers were good. Waiter didn't go out of way for party. Had no idea that the cake we brought needed refrigeration and at least he offered a candle and lighter for the candles. Kind of inexperienced or not enthusiastic at all. Well all went well though."}
{"text":"Since Lucille's was sending out 2-4-1s, we decided to give it another chance at lunch today.  But apparently they need the business & thus have their servers promoting all menu items to the point of ad nauseum... would you like Sangria with that?  How about a larger portion?  Are you sure you don't want any dessert?  Otherwise, efficient.  

I ordered the tri-tip salad and my partner the gumbo.  It was long in coming, though not very busy during our time there (1:00-2:00).  The chef must have dumped a half cup of salt into that gumbo because it was not edible, so he ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.  It didn't come til' I was done with my salad & unfortunately fell apart in his hands because of a too-old crumbly bun (which he ate anyway, out of hunger).  It had cheese on top which I'd not seen on a BBQ sandwich.  My salad had 4 very thin slices of not espec. tantalizing tri-tip & a sweet dressing over gourmet greens w/red & yellow bell peppers & red onion slivers.

Even those divine biscuits with honey butter could not make up for the lunch faux pas, & the noisy blues music which needed a full dose of Keb Mo and Eric Bibb to SOOTHE my soul."}
{"text":"I went in here with a couple of friends. We had all been to one of their other restaurants in CA. The food here is very good. However, we had a few service mishaps. We had been on the road for a few hours and we were all a bit parched. Our drinks came first but they were not long for this world. Our waiter took our orders and said he would bring out some biscuits. And the wait began...  We were on the patio with little wait traffic. We did not get refills until our main course arrived. At that point, I told him that we never got our biscuits, salads or refills. He apologized, as did the manager, who took $10 off our bill. These things then came right away. One friend and I chose a feast for two, that comes with dessert. On placing our order, we told him what we wanted. However, he later returned with a dessert menu. I reminded him what we ordered. After quite some time, he returned and blamed the delay on kitchen staff. Our food was delicious and plentiful but the service shortcomings were not sufficiently overcome."}
{"text":"Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que is decent but overpriced. Let's be real for a minute, this place is a chain, and as much as I like coming here for quick BBQ it's still turn and burn, get people in and get people out as fast as you can for as much money as you can. I wouldn't say that it's the fast food of BBQ that would be taking it too far but it really is as close as you can get to it without crossing that line. When I say it's overpriced i'm saying it's overpriced for what you're getting because it's not the best quality food or cuts of meat for the price you pay. For example, the Grilled Salmon here at Lucille's is $22.99 and one of my favorite items on the menu. It's a salmon fillet seasoned and hickory smoked or grilled. Served with New Orleans mustard cream sauce, Creole rice and fresh vegetables. It's good but it's not wild caught, and for $22.99 it should be. If places like Bone Fish Grill can sell Fresh Wild Caught Sockeye Salmon for $24.00, then so can Lucille's but they won't. I guess that's what happens when your business is solely profit driven. For these prices the meat should be grass fed with no hormones or antibiotics, the chicken should be organic free range, the fish should be wild caught. I'm not really trying to harp on Lucille's because I do enjoy their food I'm simply stating that they are absolutely overpriced for what you get that's all. Anyway back to the food the hot links are great and something I always order regardless of what entrée I order. One of my favorite things to order is the Lucille's BBQ Tri Tip Sandwich slow smoked, Certified Angus Beef tri tip, hand carved, tossed in mop sauce and piled on a soft brioche bun. When it comes to BBQ I like to order the Smoked BBQ Half Chicken which is a house favorite. Half of a fresh chicken, marinated in their lip smackin' BBQ sauce for 24 hours, slow smoked to perfection and finished on the grill. When it comes to ribs they offer three different types Baby Back Ribs, St. Louis Spare Ribs and my go to personal favorite is their BBQ Beef Ribs. My two favorite sides are the Cornbread and Garlic Mashed Potatoes and when the Cornbread is hot and fresh it's delicious. Lastly I wash everything down with a giant mason jar full of fresh brewed Sweet Tea!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. The atmosphere is way over the top, to the point that it kind of bugged me a little. The walls are plastered with fake antique signs, small floral prints, painted messages and quotes- It kind of made me feel anxious. There is also a weird gator head at the bar- it's that kind of place. 

Other than that though the food was amazing. We started with fried okra and it was awesome- nice big pieces deep fried and served with a delicious spicy mustard sauce. Hubby enjoyed the novelty of iced tea served in mason jars. We both had bbq tri tip sandwiches which were very good and not at all greesy, and I loved the spicy bbq sauce. I was a bit disappointed with the braised greens- they were extremely salty and devoid of flavor. Also, the server was ok enough, he just lacked any kind of enthusiasm.

All in all it was a pretty good experience and we would try it again."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Our server Ashley was the best and made sure we were accommodated the entire time."}
{"text":"**Summary**
       - BBQ - They have 3 BBQ sauces. Original, spicy, and one mixed with a vinaigrette I think. The spread their original on all their meats by default (you can ask for the meats dry without sauce if you'd like). The original is my favorite, and is on the sweeter sides of most sauces.
       - Beef Ribs - Giant ribs with a lot of meat.
       - Baby Back Ribs - The waiter told us these were the most tender and has less meat than the St. Louis. However, we found that they were slightly drier.
       - St. Louis Ribs - Meatier and the most tender, this was my favorite rib hands down. The meat on the sides were a little chewy, but the meat in the middle was perfect.
       - Consistency - We were told depending who finished off the ribs, some might be more tender than others. Of the ribs we got, the best ones were a step beyond most rib places. However, the drier parts were on par with cheaper BBQ places.
       - Smoker - They have their own smoker in the middle of the restaurant. I thought this was a nice addition to the whole authentic feel of the place.
       - Live band - We came at 7:30pm on a Friday and was greeted to a 45 minute wait and a live band (2 guys).
       - Portion size - The food we got for was definitely too much. The 2 meat combo and the appetizer rib alone would feed 2 people easily. On a side note, the sides are kinda small compared to the meats.
**Ordered**
       - Biscuts and Apple Butter - They bring this to you at the beginning and it is freakin' awesome. The butter is made with butter, cinnamon and apple sauce. It goes perfectly with the fluffy biscut that already has sugar sprinkled on top.
       - $3.99 Southern Fried Dill Pickles (Half) - They were pretty good. Lightly breaded and crisp. But since they were spears the breading always came off them too easily after the first bite.
       - $13.49 Lucille's Chicken Salad - The first time I've had chicken salad where the chicken wasn't dry. It was really good. However, I didn't like the balsamic vinaigrette, so I got it dry. I added some of their BBQ sauce as dressing, and that was delicious.
       - $27.99 BBQ 2 Meat Combo Platter - We got baby back ribs and beef ribs. The plate is giant. 4 large beef ribs and half a rack of baby backs. Their BBQ sauce is perfect, sweet but not too sweet.
       - $13.99 BBQ Rib Appetizer - Got the St. Louis on this one and the meat near the bone was super tender and succulent. However, on one side of the rack and on the crust, it got a little dry.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a really nice BBQ place, and don't mind spending a bit. Though their prices are a little higher than most, you're paying for the quality."}
{"text":"It's becoming our Family's favorite place & recently it's our go to restaurant when we want to eat out. Beef ribs are delish & everything else we've tried so far has been tasty & prepared to perfection"}
{"text":"Ate here last night and really liked it. The place was busy and the people watching was good. Our server was really sweet and efficient yet she stayed out of our faces so we could take our time. Had some drinks and a shameful amount of food. Everything was great. We had the queso dip with pork and basically tried all the meats. My favorite was the brisket. The cornbread was so delicious, Cole slaw was crisp and yummy and the garlic mashed potatoes are the stuff dreams,are made of. Will be back."}
{"text":"HAPPY HOURS! Lucille's does not have one, but two a day. They begin from 4-7 and then 9 to close. Jack W. and I were lounging around looking for who has the best happy hour deals and the lounge within this restaurant had stood out amongst all the rest. 

They have house well drinks $3.75, Jose Cuervo margaritas for the same price, Back porch strawberry lemonades are $5.25, Joe's Hurricane $4.75 (Mai Tai with Armaretto), crocodile coolers for $5.25 (Not sure what goes into this), and a mint julep $4.25 that they do not skimp on the alcohol. Just thinking about the Southern cocktail has me reeling in fear. The days of college binge drinking are over, so a few drinks from this place leaves you in a nice place. 

Blame it on the economy or just the lack of new innovations, but the District has quieted down quite a bit. Going early in anticipation of the crowds that use to frequent this place left us speechless when we walked in and sat down right away. That's alright, just means more time to sit and enjoy ourselves.

Although we were planning on having another person join us, that did not stop us from going all out in our first order. With BBQ brisket sliders $3.99, wings $3.99, onion straws $2.99, and BBQ rib tips for $5.99 what's the harm in ordering them all with the intention of getting more when the other person joins. In hindsight, I can tell you what the problem with that is, but I do not regret our decision. Especially since the waitress was nice enough to bring us two orders of their famous biscuits and apple butter. 

Round two called for the spinach dip, $3.99, which was a little too greasy for my taste. The Irish nachos, $1.99, an order of cheese fries with green onions and sour cream were better without the latter ingredient. We also got another order of the wings. For size of the wings alone, these were a better deal than Buffalo Wild Wings on wings Tuesday. You get six large wings that are fried crisp and tossed in your choice of Frank's red hot sauce, Memphis, original, or the spicy BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good food, usually has friendly service. 
The food is delicious, no matter what you get, it doesn't have to be BBQ. Portions are big but not too big. The while you wait biscuits with sweet butter are to die for. Three different types of their BBQ sauce is on the table if you're not happy with what is currently slathered on your meat. The ribs aren't the best I've ever had but they are decent. Great place for groups or family get togethers. The service isn't as good at this location in Red Rock Casino. I prefer to go to the Green Valley location even if it's a little farther away."}

{"text":"I want to thank Lucille's for helping me out in a pickle. I was hosting my sisters baby shower and with all the running around totally forgot I needed side dishes. 

I called Lucille's and asked for 2 gallons of Mac and cheese and 2 gallons of potato salad in less than an hour on a Saturday morning ?. 

The reply was we can do that! I picked up my sides the guest LOVED the Mac and cheese and the potato salad and all was well. 

I used to live in the Phoenix area but now live in Georgia, but every time I visit my sister and new niece (yayyyy) I will visit Lucille's. You guys rock!

Thank you! 

I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love the baby back ribs! Baked potato and corn on the cob are always a hit. My husband and I usually share because the portions are generous -- we don't like leftovers. This is our go-to restaurant."}
{"text":"Came in and no employees working the host stand. Waited in a line of other customers for 10 minutes. Lots of employees saw the line but ignored it. Finally hosts showed up. Restaurant was 80% empty but we were told a 10 minute wait. Really?
Finally seated. Took forever to get food ordered. Within 1 minute of ordering food a server placed food in front of us that was not ours. Saw waiters running around asking what food went on what tables. Our waitress had the personality of a brick wall. Just all around terrible service. Food was ok."}
{"text":"I have been to Lucille's quite a few times but this was my first time doing take out. I wasn't thrilled. 

First there was a long wait for my order (even though I came after the time they said it would be ready). 

Then I had to ask for biscuits, which delayed the order even more.  

Then I asked if there was BBQ sauce in the bags and they said yes.  Got home and there was none.  

We had the BBQ tips, baby back ribs, fried shrimp and catfish combo, gumbo, and tri-tip.  

Tri-tip was dry (would have been passable if they had included the sauce), bbq tips were just okay.  Shrimp and catfish were greasy (they aren't in the restaurant), gumbo was very tasty, and ribs were the only real stand out/worth the money item."}
{"text":"So disappointed with my experience tonight that I'll likely never return to this location again and question if I will continue to patronize the chain at all.  I've been to 6 or 8 of their locations and have ALWAYS without question had a great experience both in terms of food quality and service.

Tonight however was different.  I walked into my home town Lucille's and was smugly 'greeted' by some half hazard welcome.  The guy serving as host was less than friendly but managed to ask me how many in my party?  One, I replied ..from here he speaks into his headset microphone to summons someone to come seat me.  He hands her my soon to be menu and says 'put him in the bar'.  Now there are many times that I prefer to sit in the bar, but tonight just wasn't one of them and furthermore I would just prefer to have been asked if this option was ok.  I had just landed from a week long business trip and stopped by Lucille's to have dinner to allow the traffic to die down.  I might also add that I was dressed in business attire .. I didn't look like some bum off the street and couldn't understand why I couldn't have a regular table with the others.

I was shuffled off to the bar where I was offered one of the high top tables.  My money is obviously not good enough to rent one of the 30+ empty dining room tables for 20 - 30 minutes.  It was 5:15 pm by the way ... it was ahead of the prime busy dinner period of 6pm, etc.  Every single high top table was empty also to give you an idea of how busy the place was.  I didn't want a high top table so I asked for something else .. I was offered some random 6-top table sitting right in the entrance of the bar .... I'm one person .. WHY would I want a 6-top table?  Well, obviously again my money is simply not welcome for a dinning room table with the common folk.  I didn't want this large table or its poor location ... so my third and final option was the booth right out of the kitchen .. it was obvious that there was no way that I was going to get one of those seemingly high demand empty dinning room tables.

I asked the girl that seated me why I was not given a choice if I wanted to sit in the bar.  She became a bit defensive and said 'that's why I asked you if wanted to sit here or over there' ... NO, not you .. I wanted to know why the rude guy that told you to seat me in bar didn't give me a choice.  What if I was a recovering alcoholic .. doesn't matter .. you are only 1 person and their perception is that you wouldn't tip enough to get a dinning room table.

Reality is I tip very well .. and I know what I want, order fast, and I'm out of there .. IF there was demand for the tables they would have been better off to put me in the dinning room as I would have allowed them to turn the table over more quickly than a family coming in for a night of chatting and occupying the table.

Whatever ...

After I sat in my assigned bar booth for nearly 15 minutes without anyone even approaching my table I finally gave up and took my unworthy self out the front door ...  It's really sad to see how quickly the service is fading at this restaurant ....  Sad, Sad, Sad ....

I made my way down the parking lot to The Keg ,, incidentally, I tipped my server (who was phenomenal)  $20 on a $42 dinner.  The whole experience as enjoyable starting with walking in the door and being treated with a smile and a warm welcome. When the hostess asked how many in my party and I replied 'one' she then asked, would you prefer to be seated in our dining room or lounge area?  Obviously I opted for the dinning room."}
{"text":"The libations were good. The biscuits are a bit bland. We shared the Southern Favorites Platter appetizer- all fried pickles, okra, onions, and tomatoes. The batter wasn't very flavorful, which is a bummer because they pride themselves on their recipe. Overall not bad, but not great. I can't vouch for their meats because we weren't super hungry. If you're a barbecue foodie, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Simply put, walked in, was told there was a 20 minute wait for a table but there was a high top available. We sat at it. 10 minutes. No one. Plenty of help walked past, no service. Meanwhile plenty of booths were available around us. Go back to the front and point out we haven't had anyone stop by in 10 minutes, and there were booths everywhere. Told us to wait a few minutes. 

Nah. 

Writing this from Yard House next door. Sat immediately, serviced immediately. Sad too, I was in the mood for BBQ."}
{"text":"From Ashley our server, to the food...FANTASTIC!  The brisket was SO tender.  Although I had a horrible experience last time I was there.(May 2003) Ashley's great service and Lucille's hot food made up for it!  It was pricey but the quality makes it worth it!  If I want cheap garbage, I'll go to MCB.  For barbecue, it's Lucille's or nothing at all!  Makes Ellis Island's ribs, which have gone downhill look like trash. Ellis decided to cut back on quality.  Lucille's didn't.  Way to go!"}
{"text":"I'm not nuts about barbecue but I'm on vacation and it was the family's pick. The food was fine, everyone liked it etc etc. BUT the real reason for this review is the service. We had one of the best waitresses I have ever had in my life. I wish I'd gotten her name because I want everyone to know how amazing she was. We had a table of nine and she remembered EXACTLY who ordered what and when to refill drinks and she was just so pleasant and professional."}
{"text":"Oh yes Lucille's smokehouse is so delicious I've been here on several occasions and I get the baby back ribs and the large ribs beef ribs next and it's the licious if anyone's in the area or by any of these locations I would definitely say come in and you will have a delicious time"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my visit today! The biscuits were not warm and were hard as rocks! We were told that they are not house made anymore; they come in frozen. FAIL! 
And, the mashed taters and potato salad was beyond white folks bland! Sorry...where are the black cooks??!! We were by the kitchen and the cooks were Latino...soul food, you need an old black man named Sam and his white side kick Jack from Mississippi to show the youngstas how it's really done!
Well, service was slow and they were not busy...this was on Good Friday when we went...dont think we will be going to this location anymore. Gonna try Red Rock to see if better...love Red Rock because they do play dig in the crates blues music...
Best part of meal was tri tip with the au jus sauce...oh, AWESOME! Other than that, FAIL to the Henderson restaurant"}
{"text":"Not southern. Southern Fried chicken should have taste and bone in. Ribs should not be coated in candy BBQ sauce. Nobody in my party even ate half. Not enough fresh vegetables with the order. All in all, a lot of money wasted on food that wasn't eaten. Go to Chandler and eat at Rudy's. 1/2 the price with much much better food. I am pretty ticked off at the experience. Last but not least, we weren't even offered a refill on our drinks!"}
{"text":"I came here with my aunt and daughter for dinner and we had no wait time to be seated. All the staff was very friendly and the decorations and tables/chairs were super cute. 

I ordered the half chicken and two meats which were the burnt ends and hot link. My sides were corn on the cob and Mac and cheese. I really enjoyed the chicken and burnt ends plus the bbq sauce was delicious!! I didn't really like the hot link though. The Mac and cheese was a little dry but it was not terrible and the corn on the cob was pretty good but it did not come with any butter. My daughter had the tri tip and Mac and cheese and she loved her tri tip as well as her root beer she ordered for dessert. My aunt had the same thing as me but she had rib tips and tri tip and greens and Mac and cheese. She also thought the Mac and cheese was a little dry but we both loved the greens ( she let me try hers) ! Also, the biscuits with the apple butter are suuuuuper good!! I should have asked for more.

Oh yeah!! The PEACH LEMONADE .. oh em gee!! it is sooooooo good!!! it comes in a huge mason jar and it was perfect. 

over all, I would come here again to try some of the other items on the list."}
{"text":"Very mediocre BBQ for an outrageous price.
  I'm not sure if BBQ with would chips or just cook it in an oven.

Wife had beef ribs which looked amazing, but the flavor was average and a little tough. 

I had the gumbo which as ok.

Honestly I think that rudys BBQ is lightyears better and half the price."}
{"text":"Good happy hour....decent food and very nice efficient service, despite the place being quite busy."}
{"text":"Today was my first experience dining here.  The family and I met to celebrate two birthdays together while enjoying a family dinner.  I can't think of one negative thing about our complete dining experience from the Food to the service.  Our server Mark was hands down one of the best servers I have ever had wait my table.  He was very outgoing and knowledgeable, and just took care of our table from start to finish.  The food was excellent and cooked perfectly!  This will be my go to barbecue joint from this point on in the east valley area!!"}
{"text":"We'll usually make it to Lucille's about once every year or so and nothing is ever that memorable and nothing is ever really that bad except my beef ribs on our last visit. We made it a point on this particular visit to try some items that we've never had before. The menu consists of your regular slow, smoked meats, and also, an entire section devoted to some classic Southern specialties. Although the Southern shack themed restaurant is spacious and includes a large patio for outdoor seating, it's usually busy enough to be on a wait and a reservation is probably a good idea, especially on the weekend.

The tri tip, brisket, and both types of pork ribs are pretty good to me as long as they aren't smoked to leather status and I'll usually pick two of the meats for a combo. I gave the beef ribs a try this time and for $24.99, I got 3 bones which I think someone had gnawed some of the meat off them before they got to the table. And the meat that was on them was dry, tough, and gave my jaw muscles some extra work.

Lucille's brews by Golden Road Brewing Co. were also something I was always aware of, but had never tried. So I ordered Lucille's Beer Flight and for $6.95 you get nice sampling of four 3-4 oz pours. The Red Ale was my favorite and would be a nice pairing with all of the smoked meats.

My wife and daughter split the two meat combo ($29.99) with baby back ribs and the cheddar and bacon sausage. They devoured the ribs and I only got one bite of the sausage. The cheese and bacon in the sausage was as good of a combination as you'd expect it to be.

Service was solid for the meal and we felt comfortable in the Southern atmosphere. There's no rush, but we'll be back at some point because of the convenient location and I'll stick with my standard meats."}
{"text":"Very rude. My husband waited in line to order take out and was completely ignored. He waited in line and the host took someone that walked in after my husband and didn't even acknowledge him. Very rude. Maybe an off day but we will not be back"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken and Ribs plate. Portions are rather small and I'm just an average to light eater. Ribs were overcooked and dry (as if they were sitting under a heating lamp for some time), chicken was ok, but nothing special. Definitely not worth the price, would not be back."}
{"text":"I have always had great service and great food here. Actually, my boyfriend made me go here when it first opened; I was not too excited about going as I was not a big BBQ fan. But I have converted! I love the stuff. We always sit in the bar area or at the bar. 

This has become our go-to place at Tempe Marketplace and have brought many of our out of town guests here. 

Great management ,great staff, great food!"}
{"text":"I liked it!  We went for lunch I got the pulled pork baked potato and a salad, hit the spot.  The biscuits they start you off with are sinful and just plain mean if you are trying to eat healthy!"}
{"text":"Brought friends from Michigan to try our favorite place.  Everyone ordered something different (catfish,burger, salad and tri-tip).  The portions were huge and everything was good to perfection.  My only complaint is that we asked for a booth and were sat NOT in a booth out on the porch area.  We were all freezing since there were several fans near us.  The waitress did state that the area was very cold.  I will know next time to wear a jacket and mittens if sitting outside there!  lol.  My friends loved it so much they bought three bottles of barbeque sauce to bring back with them."}
{"text":"A friend invited me to dinner, and this was the choice for the evening.

Being from Texas, I am WELL familiar with barbecue.  I was not, however, expecting this.  After reading Yelp!, I noticed the classification for this restaurant was \"Creole/Cajun.\"

\"Wait, WHAT\", I remarked to myself, and at that point was duly interested.

I didn't eat a big meal, but I ate well.  I tried their fried pickles, and those are excellent, with the ranch and creole mustard.  My main dish was the gumbo, and holy cow.  That was proper, full, \"bonafide\" delicious.  The roux was properly smoky, and full of andouille, chicken and shrimp.  I actually saved a little to take home so I could have some for later.

Service was excellent.  Our server (Abby), was friendly, accommodating, and funny.  She was on top of everything, despite the room being so crowded, and was as nice as could be.

The also had a live band playing some Southern blues music, and it fit the atmosphere of the place well.

The downside?  It's on the complete opposite side of town for me (story of my life), and I'm not a big fan of the epic drive that it takes to get from one side of Vegas to the other.  That said, I'll suck it up, and come back out this way for this place.

I was impressed.  I haven't found a decent Cajun place out in Vegas until this, and the first experiment was a winner.

I left full and happy, with a tiny portion of gumbo in tow, and left wondering how good will the other meals be."}
{"text":"Attended to hear live music. Second visit. As a place that aspires to Southern cooking, especially BBQ, Lucille's falls far short. Beef brisket was tough; BBQ chicken was ok; sides not so much. And how can you pose as a Southern restaurant and not serve cornbread? Or hushpuppies?
Good draft beer selection. Service at the bar was friendly and quick. Live music was good, not outstanding.
If you're a fan of good BBQ, then there are much better choices in Phoenix. Avoid Lucille's if you've ever had the opportunity to eat good Southern BBQ. This most definitely isn't it."}
{"text":"Gah, they changed the veggie burger! GAH! It is a premade patty now- GAAAAHHHHH

Service is still lacking- GAAHAHAHAHAHA

We came here for my brother's graduation and called it in a week before. So one would think they would be prepared for us. No. Not at all. We got our drinks after 20min, then finally got our food orders in after 30min along with our sugary biscuits, which I am starting to suspect is the only thing good here. Our waitress was slow, and I know she didn't have any other tables because we were there pretty late and there were only a few other tables, with enough waiters to take care of them. Not only that but she clearly had no idea what the menu consisted of. If it was her first night, I can understand. But since her fuck ups were on one thing only (the Super family meal we ordered) it stands to reason that she just sucks at her job. First she messed up the amount of sides the meal comes with- which I had to point out, which was fine. She looked it over on the menu and corrected herself. Now, I say she looked at the menu because later when she was asked when the salad was suppose to come out, she countered with \"Salad doesn't come with that.\" You just looked at it. Yes, it does. 

But really the question I should be asking, is who the hell in the kitchen forgot about it as well? Doesn't she put in the order and they make it? What the hell is wrong with these people?"}
{"text":"Wow! I am truly impressed! The baby back ribs are by far the best I have ever had. So moist and tender. The smoky flavor is subtle and the sauce is perfect. Absolutely delicious. A full rack of ribs, two sides and biscuits for $25?! Can't beat that, plus it's enough food for two! I also tried the southern fried catfish and shrimp, crusted with cornmeal and fried to perfection....super tasty! Also came with two sides and biscuits for $18. There was enough food to feed 4 people. Everyone was satisfied. It's my new favorite BBQ joint!"}
{"text":"if you are currently counting your daily calories then this warning is issued for you:: DO NOT GO HERE... i warned you! what you do with this information is now in your hands.

Call ahead if you get impatient waiting because you will have to wait here. You can sign in there and they will text you when your table is ready which is pretty cool. They have live music so it is really loud (makes sense a text msg if prob the only way to find you). We had a drink while we waited for our table, they even have a cute little area with couches where you can wait. Loved the loud and informal nature of this place. 

Menu is ginormous as well as the portions. We got a 1/2 order of fried pickles and onion strings to start ( the 1/2 portions look to me like what i would consider a full portion,, just ridiculous amounts of food).  both got the baby back ribs. All your normal bbq fixins' to choose from to go with your entree. order came with this biscuits that i swear tasted like they had sugar on them with an apple butter of some sort that was just sinful. 

Everything was great, had no room for dessert and i didn't even finish 1/2 my baby back order. 

this place will be an every now and then splurge as i think i am still burning off the calories ."}
{"text":"They have really screwed up. They've gotten rid of the cheese grits, even though it's mentioned on the front of their menu. They got rid of the the pepper vinegar sauce. They have really gone down hill and are not half the restaurant they once were. They don't have the smoked wings or the peanut slaw anymore either. I would suggest going to Memphis BBQ instead. They still have greens at least. Oh and they got rid of the dirty rice which really made the gumbo and jambalaya so good."}
{"text":"I attended a private party here recently on a Thursday night, and 40 of us had the side room adjacent to the bar all to ourselves.  Our hosts ordered several of the Lucille's Super Feasts, so we were able to try almost everything they offer.

Beef ribs: by far my favorite dish.  They were huge and meaty, but very tender & flavorful.  Don't be dainty and folk-and-knife these suckers.  Just go all Fred Flintstone on them and eat them like giants turkey legs!

Baby back ribs:  a close 2nd to the beef ribs, also very flavorful.  Could have easily polished off a rack of these suckers.

Sausage:  I'm not normally a fan of hot links, but these were pretty good.  They had a good amount of kick to them, but not too spicy to need too much water or milk.  The casings had a good snap, too.

Tri-tip:  probably the most disappointing part of the meal.  The meat was a little dry and probably overcooked.  Needed BBQ sauce to get them down.

When I come back for a regular meal, I will stick to the beef ribs (since most BBQ joints don't offer them) and feel like I'm a caveman.
'
Also, the staff were very accommodating to this crazy group.  And the bartender gave us very generous pours of our drinks!"}

Tasha...I think that's her name ....either way she seen my shirt and realized we're both from same burb in Cleveland ....she was awesome .... Food was on point!    I'd go again when I feel like being a fatty!!!!  Get the pulled pork and spare ribs ...."}

{"text":"I walked in at 9:15 in both the hostess  trying to force me to the bar I had to tell them twice I wanted to sit in the dining room. After my order was taken I never saw my waitress again.  Instead I had to listen to the other server complaining about tips from her tables and only interested in dropping off checks to get people out of here so she could leave. All I ask is you get my order right and keep my refills going. I have 3 waitresses passed by my section repeatedly not one of them asked if they could get me a refill even though I pushed my empty drink all the way to the edge of the table repeatedly. NO team service in this environment at all here. You can complain about not getting tips on you get horrible service this coming from a person has been a restaurant manager for 15 years and work for the lights of Fleming's Steakhouse and other celebrity chefs in town.  I'm pretty low maintenance I won't bother you but if you can't even get me a refill and check on me once and all I hear is you complaining we got a problem."}
{"text":"This is my fave Out of all the restaurants at Red Rock Casino. Bbq shrimp, baby back ribs, tri tips, bread with apple butter and the best chocolate cake ever.. yummmmm! . I've been here at least 8 times and I liked everything I ordered so far."}
{"text":"Went there last night for my Birthday with my wife and kids. Outstanding BBQ and great service. Had a wonderful time there."}
{"text":"Usually when I ask my boyfriend where he wants to go for dinner, his reply is always Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que. We don't come here as often as he would like but we try to eat here at least once a month, whether it's dining in or getting takeout.

We like to be seated in the back, away from the bar area where the music can get really loud. There was one time when we were seated right in the first booth and it was fine at first but then the band started playing and we could not hear each other or even enjoy our meal. We had to ask to be moved away from the music and they were happy to obliged.

I always order the Smoke Salmon which is so good and tasty, and I get a side of their Southern Braised Greens which I love! My boyfriend has his favorite which he always gets and that is the Back Porch: Ribs, Chicken, and Tri Tip Platter. And, without fail, his response is always \"Wow, it is so much food!\".  He can finish the whole thing himself without any help from me.

We would like to try their dessert one day but we get so full from the entrees. I guess we'll just have to eat half our meal, take the rest in a doggy bag, and we've made room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I went to Lucille's for my cousins birthday on Saturday. This was the first time I had ever been to this barbque house. I am very picky when it comes to barbque because my husband is such a great cook! but.....this place was great! Yeah we had to wait awhile but it was worth the wait! The beef ribs and tri tip were great and I would recommend this place to everyone. It was a bit on the pricey side but well worth it!"}
{"text":"we had lunch at Lucille's 1/3/2014. first of all our server was outstanding,but there was quite a wait for our main course to arrive which i don't think was the fault of our server. i ordered the shrimp Po'boy and my wife had the catfish Po'boy. and both sandwiches was far below our expectations. my shrimp was far overcooked with little or no flavor, plus there was more batter than shrimp (small). next trip we will stick with the bar-b-que. the smoky wings made up for the Po'boys."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the family. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries. My bun was soggy couldn't even pick it up and my fries looked over cooked. Manager came back apologized and gave me a new bun and fries. But it took a while to get that needless to say I had most of it boxed up ready to go. The manager took my meal off the bill that's the only reason this review is 4 stars. Very good customer service if I come again I will just order something else."}
{"text":"BEYOND THRILLED we finally have one in Summerlin! I really love this place! I've been to the one in Henderson many times, and the Summerlin location is just as amazing! In fact, I went three times for dinner the first week it opened! The servers recognized me and my kids! It was kind of funny, I have to admit. Outstanding barbeque. I just love this restaurant! Thank you for coming to Summerlin!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, when we lived in Roseville, Ca there was one walking distance from our place.... And walking is exactly what you should do to get to and from because you will put on about 5 pounds at every meal. The portions are huge and the food is delicious, This is the place to go if your looking for some food that will stick to your ribs and fingers and you can wash it all down with some classic sweet tea right out of a mason Jar..."}
{"text":"Can't eat here anymore.  And before the Yelp police censor this post, read it.  I have been a customer for years.  I walked in today and noticed their no firearms sign for the first time.  I asked for a manager.  \"Sarah\" met with me.  I identified myself as a former cop and CCW license holder and asked about their sign and if management was serious about it.  She said they were very serious about it.  So I told her they just lost a customer.  I shared that 96% of all mass shootings happened in \"gun free\" zones and unless they wanted to assume responsibility for my safety, I could not dine here anymore.  She thanked me and I left.  Any establishment has the right to refuse service and post a sign not wanting guns carried lawfully.  And we have the right to not patronize their establishment and to share this information with our like minded friends."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to this location. We ordered off the lunch menu because we had a coupon. The salmon was cooked perfectly and was the right size for lunch. I asked for some changes to the menu and was cheerfully accommodated. The hubby's sweet potato fries were overcooked and was a skimpy portion. His ribs platter was a mix bag. Some of it was tasty and some was overcooked. Next time I will go back to the BBQ chicken salad. We had excellent service."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Vegas and I had the good fortune of traveling with someone who use to live here. On our last night here, she asked me if we could eat here as she missed this place. I was down and even though my boyfriend doesn't like BBQ he agreed to it as well.
We had a 30 minute wait but by the time we were seated we overhead the wait was an hour. Glad we got here when we did. Our server was SUPER friendly. Service was a tad bit slow, but the place was busy. We decided to our the combo platter and just share everything. We got the beef rips, tri tip and chicken with cole slaw, mashed sweet potatoes and the baked beans. Everything was sooooo yum! The chicken was so moist and flavorful. The mash tasted like Thanksgivings and the beans were nice and smokey. After the meal, a hot towel is brought to you to clean off all that sticky sweet sauce. Even the non-BBQ loving boyfriend said the food was amazing and that's telling you something!"}
{"text":"I frequent all of the southern and soul food restaurants in the Las Vegas area and I am extremely impressed with the Lucille's Smoke House in Green Valley. I loved it! From walking in the door, the host Jacorey gave me a fantastic greeting and his demeanor was top tier and my server Katrina was the most lively and attentive. I look forward to bringing in my family to have memoral nights out. I felt so welcome in this booming atmosphere it has definitely made an impressive first time experience."}
{"text":"Come for the endless variety of BBQ, stay because you can't make a decision. Realize the selection of sides is equally expansive, and just sit there eating biscuits with apple butter until someone tells you to get the tri-tip sandwich with a side of cornbread.

I understand why people are lamenting about how stupid the prices are, but come on, y'all. You could totally share a meal with someone here and leave satisfied (as long as you eat yer biscuits.) Now, now, I know what you're thinking, \"We don't take kindly to sharers 'round these parts...\" But put down your pitchforks, because the portions are proportionally reasonable to their stupid prices.

Lucille's lands at 2 stars for good biscuit and cornbread game, solid tri-tip and peanut slaw, and subpar brisket and mac 'n' cheese. In another region, I might toss Lucy a fourth star, but anything less than the best in this BBQ-splattered town just won't win my stomacheart."}
{"text":"Gave this establishment a chance to redeem themselves, but they were unable to. My hubby loves bbq and I love dessert, so we headed to Lucille's the other night. The wait was supposed to be 15 minutes, but we were seated after 30 minutes. The restaurant was maybe 2/3 full and the service was super slow. I ordered the \"Famous\" Banana Pudding and the hubby got the 1/2 chicken and two meats with two sides. He liked his food with the exception of a random piece of zucchini in his pulled pork. I had asked for my Banana Pudding to come out ASAP since my blood sugar was low. It didn't come out til my husband was halfway through his meal even though I ordered it as soon as we sat down. The waiter apologized and said that the first one fell on the floor and they had to make a new one. That happens, I get it...but it doesn't take 30 minutes to put together a new Banana Pudding. What I wasn't crazy about was this:
1- the pudding was at room temperature - which tasted really weird.
2- I asked for them to go light on the whipped cream, but it was served with tons of whipped cream.
3- there were only two tiny banana slices on top of the whipped cream and none in the actual dessert. Any other banana pudding I've ever gotten had bananas in the mix.

Overall, I still can't recommend this place. The waiters have no energy, the food is served without pride and I don't think the food justifies the prices charged."}
{"text":"I love Lucille's in Henderson and have been there a number of times but there's something about  this new Lucille's I don't like-  they are so chintzy! they don't want to give you enough biscuits, and the baby back ribs are ridiculously tiny.  Considering the prices, I don't want to spend my money there."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at Lucille's.  My friend and I had a super friendly waitress, which made the experience even better.  We went around 8:30 pm on a Thursday, so we had no wait for a table.  As for cleanliness, I have to say I can't stand sitting where there are dusty, dirty hanging light fixtures over the table- who knows what might fall into your food?  No such problem here- the fixtures were spotless, and the floors and tables were clean.

I was able to try a little of several items: beef ribs, pork ribs, fried green tomatoes, biscuit, baked beans, cheeseburger (medium rare!), and shoestring fries. Everything was delicious.  At the table are three types of barbecue sauce to choose from, one of them hot, which I tend to avoid (my hot sauce-loving friend says it wasn't hot at all, but I thought it was comfortably spicy). All of them were quite good.

The place is a tad pricey- we paid about $60 for two sodas, a beef rib appetizer, and our two entrees.  They put a basket with two biscuits on the table, and thank goodness there were only two because we would not have been able to eat our dinner! Neither of us could finish our meals anyway, so we had to take them home. I will definitely be back. This is the best-tasting barbecue I've had so far in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"9/19 update
Manager Rebekah reached out to us to show their concern. It is rare that management does this, so I upgraded their review. We will be giving this restaurant a second chance, so the review could change again. 



So sad to have to leave a negative review, but our visit was just awful. Our waitress was so rude. We were a large party, which apparently annoyed her. She took our order and went off. We didn't see her again until she brought our salads, which had no dressing. We waited another 15 minutes to get someone to bring us dressing. They brought the dressing with our meals. So that ruined the point of the salad. Then I had to take my kiddo to the bathroom & the waitress took my almost untouched meal and threw it away because \"she thought I was done\". No apology, no offer to bring me anything else. Such a disappointment. We have been to this location a few times and the service was AWFUL! We will not be back."}
{"text":"I went with a group of people at 7:30 on a Saturday night. It was packed. We ended up sitting in the enclosed wrap-around porch. What was a little odd was that they had live LOUD music blaring, and a lot of families with little kids. You couldn't have a conversation without yelling at somebody. We didn't have kids, but I would have walked out if I did. Anyway, I ordered brisket -- which I think is the litmus test of any decent BBQ joint. It didn't pass. The brisket was dry and hard. I even picked it up to see how easily it would come apart. It didn't. The gang had chicken and ribs, and they were happy. Maybe I should give up on brisket. I've been to this place for lunch a couple of times and the barbecue is decent."}
{"text":"Great service and great for big group. The full rack of ribs was very soft and delicious."}
{"text":"I love BBQ and Lucille's is a great place for BBQ. I got the stuffed baked potato today and it was good but a little on the dry side. Especially since I ate here for lunch and I wouldn't expect the potato to have been sitting that long. I love the biscuits and butter and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Love this place food was amazing!! Cost in my opinion is really good for the great service and food I received. Highly suggest this place"}
{"text":"Very good place great food and great service!! Great place to watch games and take kids."}
{"text":"This is our default BBQ place since it's the closest one to our house.  The food is consistent and the biscuits are always delicious!  I like to take advantage of the online to-go order form, but for some reason, either the remarks section do not work or the servers do not read the comments.  Although the server always go over what you ordered, he/she does NOT \"pack the extra sauce\" that you've requested in the comments section so make sure you don't rush off too quickly now.  :-)"}
{"text":"I go to Lucille's pretty often and it usually doesn't disappoint. They have the best fried pickles!!! ( if your into that sorta thing) They have great salads and burgers, and of course the bbq aint bad either. I tried the shrimp po' boy sandwich and I was not impressed, its way too much bread and breading on the shrimp."}
{"text":"I had a rack of the bbq ribs, but they were somewhat hard and dried out.  Very disappointed considering this is a BBQ place.  I thought that it would be tasty and juicy.  The service though was pretty good though, personable and friendly."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place forever, but I'm not sure why other than yelpers seem to love it and it is close to the house.  However, let me disclose that there is few BBQ restaurants I've been to that I really have loved, so you may not want to listen to me if Lucille's is your bag.

I hadn't eaten anything the day I went here, and a plate of filling BBQ sounded good to me.  I wanted to try a few things so I got a combo plate with baby back ribs and the beef ribs.  I knew it would be too much food but I figured I could take home what I didn't eat.  For sides, I had corn and cole slaw for a tiny bit of vegetables.  My husband and I tried the onion strings and he had the pulled pork.

I found the onion strings to lack any sort of discernible onion flavor, which is what I like in onion ring type dishes.  It was too much focus on breading, not enough on the sweet onion.  However, my husband, who isn't into onion rings, really loved this dish.

The main dishes were okay, nothing I haven't made at home much better.  The baby backs were not that tender, but I thought the flavor was good, and I love the vinegar based sauce they have.  They were disappointing a little, but compared to another restaurant in the area, like Memphis Championship BBQ, they were a lot better.  But the beef ribs were a big disappointment, as if they managed to burn them and make them kind of \"charred,\" but not in a good way.  I felt like I was just eating burned crunchy flesh and couldn't get through more than one rib.  My husband liked his pulled pork but it wasn't anything he hasn't had better before.

What really impressed us was they have some of their own \"Lucille's beers,\" that included a Hefeweizen, which was delicious!  While our dinner wasn't impressive, we would come back for this  and the wonderful unsweetened iced teas.  So we're more than excited to do Happy Hour here, but I'm not sure we'll come back for a normal dinner."}
{"text":"Uhhhhhh no.

Look I see a lot of positive reviews here and that to me is severely troubling.  It's no secret that despite how good the food in Vegas can be, the BBQ segment of the town is sufficiently lacking.  This, in part, to me explains how reviews for a restaurant like this can be generally positive.  It's easy to think BBQ tastes good, it's meat and sauce and for some that's good enough. But if you've traveled across the country and seen what kind of BBQ is out there, you know this place isn't passable.

The key way to determine if a BBQ restaurant is good is if its food is really good without the need to even add BBQ sauce. That would mean the meat is cooked properly, seasoned properly. That's the whole ball game folks. This place doesn't pass that test.

-Appetizer Sampler. You can't say the negative review is due to a bad order when the sampler gives you 8 different items. Rip Tips-bland and tough. Sweet potato fries- bland. Tomatoes- bland. Egg rolls- I cant even remember these they must have been bad. Okra-bland. Chicken strips-bland. Hot Links- these were fine but it's sausage cmon they probably just shipped it in somewhere. And saved the worst for last, the fried dill pickles. I saw someone say the fried pickles were great and I literally slapped my forehead. These are whole pickle spears they have fried. Fried is the operative word because it's fried and not cooked.  One would expect the frying process to do both, but in a shocking twist when you fry something huge like a pickle spear for however short amount of time they did you will find a mediocre batter surrounding a rock hard pickle. It doesn't work and there's a reason why most fried pickles are made from dill chips...they are thinner, smaller, ergo they cook faster.

-Pulled Pork Sandwich. Pretty standard and pretty forgettable. Pork unseasoned. Their BBQ sauce is not enough to save this place it's a sauce that you would expect, truly nothing special.

If you need more reasons to not trust Vegas BBQ reviewers, Famous Dave's is rockin 3.5 stars. That place is straight up inedible. Just trust me, if you know what good BBQ is from Texas etc. you will know this is NOT it.

Skip!"}

{"text":"Just had the absolute worst experience here. My boyfriend and I just had lunch. I'm a vegetarian and I understand that this is a BBQ place so I asked the host if there were any vegetarian options. She told me the two items so we asked to be seated. She was very nice. Our waitress came and took our order. I got the portobello sandwich and explained that I am vegetarian. Got the French fries too. She brought the biscuits after. Lots of places use animal fat so I wanted to make sure these didn't have any. I asked the woman waiting the table behind us because ours was no where in sight. She said she didn't know and would go ask for me. After she walked past the table a few times we assumed she wasn't going to answer. Then the manager brought our food to our table. So I asked him, he went and checked and came back in one minute. He was very nice. We were talking about how the chips in lots of places fry then in the oil they cook the chicken in. While eating the fries. We decided to ask and our waitress said oh yeah I didn't even think of that when you ordered. So I just stopped eating. Needless to say I would not recommend this place to anyone who may not want to eat a particular food. They don't care about your allergy or preference. If you will eat anything, I'd say stop by, I hear the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Today, the food was fair at best.  
The sirloin steak was not seasoned much and was not very tender.  The mash potatoes were nothing special.  The mixed vegetables were watery, but flavored well.

The server was friendly and attentive.

The restaurant was not too cold or hot.

Not an experience that I'd rave about..."}

In that year it has changed quite a bit, Not near as good, veggies were way over seasoned, the cheese grits were awful, didn't eat either.  The chicken wasn't that great.  On the other hand the biscuits & lemonade were delicious.   Also outrageously expensive for the quality.  Won't be going back any time soon, which is sad because it was one of our favorite places.  But the service was great"}
{"text":"Came here with my fiancé for dinner on Friday night. The wait wasn't bad at all, they send you a text when your table is ready so it gave us some time to shop around. When our table was ready the waitress that helped us was super friendly despite being so busy! The food took FOREVER to get to us we waited about 45 minutes and then it came out cold :( after getting it warmed up a bit it was absolutely delicious! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich that was smoked to perfection and it was very filling, my fiancé ordered the rib tip sandwich that was equally as great! We had the onion straws as an appetizer and the half portion was more than enough for the both of us! They came out hot and delicious with their sauce that's to die for! Besides the slight hiccup we were extremely satisfied with our food there and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had dinner here recently and it was a much better experience than last time.  We had very good service and food.  We got there before the dinner rush so we were able to get a table right away even though it was a Friday night.  Our waiter came by and took our drink orders quickly.  He then brought the drinks and took our food order.  It took a bit of time to get a basket of biscuits but I think they had to cook another batch.  

For our entrees, I did the two meat combo with pulled pork and burnt ends.  My sides were the peanut coleslaw and mixed veggies.  The veggies normally come with peppers in them but I was able to exclude those.  Good sign that they don't pre-make the veggies.  Everything was delicious.  I loved both meats and the coleslaw had a good vinegar bite.  It was a large portion so I was able to take half of it home for lunch the next day.  

Mom had a half rack of ribs with corn on the cob and beans.  She really liked everything especially the fresh corn.  Definitely no frozen corn on the cob here.

So definitely a great place to get your BBQ fix.  The service can be hit or miss but we had good service this time around and the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"We met some friends here for lunch one afternoon recently.  We got seated right away and our waitress was very attentive.  Kept checking on us until we were ready to order and she brought out drinks and biscuits right away.  Yum!  I had the peach lemonade.  It was really fresh tasting and had a nice peach flavor. 

I had the 1/4 chicken and pulled pork lunch special with the honey roasted peanut slaw.  I always get no sauce and then worry the meat will be dry.  But I did not have to worry here.  The pork was nice and tender and moist, not dry at all.  The chicken was mostly meat which is nice since I don't like chicken on the bone.  

Others had the loaded baked potato, the rib and meat lunch special and the pulled pork sliders with a variety of sides.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  

This place does a great bbq and has lots of options and sides.  Definitely a good choice for a group."}
{"text":"SOOOOOO Yummy...and that's not just my date, but the food too! I love going to Lucille's for BBQ with a bunch of friends. It is in a really cute house like building and is great for big groups of people. 

We started off with some really yummy corn bread and apple butter. It was so tasty. I had the sweet tea which was pretty good as well, not artificial tasting and not too sweet. I think I cleared off 3 entire glasses. :)

The servings are soo big that me and my honey share every time. This last trip we got a full rack of baby back ribs with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potatoe fries. Everything was so good and the sweet potatoe fries were really tasty! 

This place is not to pricey when you share. Our bill was just over $30 for both of us and we could not even finish our food.

Sooo, next time you have a smoking date and are craving some smoking meats....you know where to go!"}
{"text":"This place is killer. The food is always hot and tasty and the service is always good. I'm patiently waiting for the location inside of the red rock to open."}
{"text":"Although the portion size here is big...so it the PRICE! It is definitely pricey and the customer service sucks! 

My husband is a huge fan of BBQ and likes the smokehouse  recipe that is used but noticeably there is more fat on the meat than there is actual \"meat\"... Personally, I do like the butter biscuits with their sweet honey butter- BUT they are very stingy as they only serve 2 at a time...so when you ask for more- the waitress definitely takes forever to get more in hopes that you have forgotten your original request....

It is somewhat tasty - but for the lack of customer service and overly priced menu: it's NOT worth visiting / making regular attempts!"}
{"text":"We loveeeeeee this place. Too bad it's a bit far from our house. The restaurant itself is located in a busy mall so finding parking can get a bit hectic but besides that the place is huge. We have never had to make a reservation even with a big party. Once you get seated and get your drinks they bring these amazing honey biscuits to die for. The menu selection is huge. Almost to hard to settle with one dish so we usually stick with the most popular item, of course the Ribs. The ribs are fab. You also get to pick your own side dish like Mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, string fries or beans. No matter what you pick its going to be good. The cocktails are good and service always fast. The part that my husband likes the most is their prices. Ver very reasonably priced. We have never left room for desert so I wouldn't know but I'm sure big portions as well."}
{"text":"walked in without expectation...during lunch and ordered their sampler entree that had everything from bbq chicken, st. louis ribs/bbq ribs, spicy hot links....etc. with garlic mash, and traditional cole slaw. yummie! 
If you are craving for some ribs and bbq def' a place that will takecare of your cravings....yum yum!!!
will go back again!  :)

plus loved their 3 different dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"I didn't even get to taste my food I ended up canceling my food because it took over 45 minutes. My family & I were beyond tired we ended up just taking our food to go because of how long the wait is. The manager ended up coming over and tried telling us our ticket was put in 20 minutes ago, but I made a phone call 30 minutes prior to the manager coming over which was already a good 25 minutes into our order. Anyways he basically stated that we were waiting the normal wait time which is apparently 20 minutes, although we were here for over 45 minutes. But it's fine, my family will take their food to go and you probably won't see us anytime soon."}
{"text":"Portions are large, Service was good, our waiter even spent time talking comics with us.  Prices are high for the quality but the food is good although some choices are better than others.  Skip the bbq chicken which was dry and go with the ribs, any style ribs will do.  Best to get them dry and put your own sauce on."}
{"text":"Great local place. Our waiter, Lou was awesome. He made it a very special & fun experience, especially for my daughter. It was her 13th birthday. The pulled pork sandwich was delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Went to the Red Rock location yesterday for lunch. The server we had was pulling double duty waiting tables and bar tending. Waited ten minutes for our drinks. 30 min later, had to flag someone down for refills. Food finally came out. Ribs, mashed potatoes, and corn bread were barely warm. $60 (diet coke, peach tea, NO alcohol) for a meal that would have been less than $20 to make at home and it would have been better. It was not busy. Not sure what people see in this restaurant."}
{"text":"All I can say is wowza! If you want to feel like you can be transported to the south with all is home cooking then go here! First of all, all the decor is so homey and adorable with so much detail! They bring you some fresh warm biscuits with apple butter. I'm not usually a bread person but I ate every morsel and had my fair share of the Apple butter! We also ordered the sweet tea. OMG! I am a huge tea person and am super picky. They bring it out in a huge mason jar and I drank almost the whole thing! 
I ordered the brisket plate. My sides were corn on the cob, baked beans, and I ordered an extra side of cornbread. The brisket was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth. They have 3 options of different kind of sauces on the table that you can pour over your meat. It was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I couldn't stop eating! 
Our waiter was awesome and attentive. He even asked if we wanted some tea to go which I happily accepted!
Lucile's is our new favorite place for some comfort food!"}
{"text":"I found the food to be mediocre. Ribs were not tender. Restaurant is VERY noisy. Quite pricey too. Memphis in Vegas is a much better BBQ experience."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would.

Story of the day.

1. Drive from Lake Havasu, included the time difference, stopped at Hoover Dam, got my fortune. It read \" You are basically a kind a good person\" well thank you.

2. Arrived in Vegas to fly home to Oakland (with the ex, lived there at the time)

3. Agreed on Luclle'e Smokehouse BBQ.

...this is where it gets fun. My family is from the south, and I think I had the opportunity to taste some of the greatest BBQ in all the land. From Texas to KCMO to Tennessee and down to Mississippi, I know good BBQ. I was wary about good BBQ being in Las Vegas though....

4. Probably the best Bourbon Julep, Tri-Tip sandwich and sides I have ever tasted. I wanted to take a bath in the mac and cheese and tried to smuggle some of the coleslaw home with me, but I ate it before I left the parking lot.

You must visit Lucilles. Read the funny history on the menu. Order a Julep. Walk around and check out the high end shops at \"The District\" when you're done.

You will not be let down by Lucille's."}
{"text":"I  usually eat in the bar  as it is much faster than waiting for a regular table.   Regardless, servers always seem like they are in the weeds.  I find the BBQ average regardless of some of the raves here.  I go for the blackened catfish on mustard sauce with greens and mashed potatoes with an Abita beer.  Overall, an average chain type restaurant with large portions and a great location."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best and very over priced. Cassidy was our bartender and she was very sweet, knew the menu well, and gave excellent service. However, the food was not very impressive. The wedge salad was probably the best part."}
{"text":"Amazing food, phenomenal service and a delightful ambiance makes me want to come back very soon! I highly recommend Lucille's and easily give it a five-star rating!"}
{"text":"Had reservations for a birthday dinner with some dear friends who had never been here. 
Southern hospitality GV location staff are much more friendly and attentive. Service may have been lacking here but the food was on point so we maybe back at some point if on this side of town in hopes that it was a 1 time ordeal, everyone has off days."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE experience.     Long story that isn't worth the time to get into b/c I wouldn't go back to this place.   Please DO NOT mistake this for the Lucille's in Henderson which I actually love.  But this place is run by a bunch of idiots and the stupidity trickles down through all of the employees that we dealt with.  

Showed up and told the hostess that we were there for happy hour (for the food).  We had 2 young kids with us so sat us in a booth just outside the bar area but technically in the main dining area.  Settled in... got daughter #1 in a booster seat and daughter #2 stayed in her car seat so had to adjust the booth a bit to get her to fit in... but took a few minutes to get settled.  

Waiter comes and takes our drink order.   We ask about the happy hour menu for some appetizers and he says that happy hour is only in the bar area.  We explained to the waiter that we told the hostess that we were there for happy hour.  So we asked if kids were allowed in the bar area.  He said that they were.  

So we looked around and there were maybe 4 or 5 other tables occupied in the entire place as it was an off time of the day... maybe 3 pm or so.  So we simply asked if it was really a big deal for them to make us move our kids, drinks, menus and all of that stuff.   He said that happy hour needed to be rung up in the bar.  So we just asked if he could just ring our order in at the bar.  He said that he wasn't allowed b/c of his manager.  We asked if we could speak with the manager.

He tracked down his manager within earshot of our table and we heard the manager basically tell him that wasn't an option and he wasn't going to come all the way over to our table to tell us that....  of course he had a bit of an attitude that he was being asked such a crazy request.  So the waiter came back to tell us what he said and we stopped him and said that we want to talk to the manager... so we insisted that he actually make him come over to talk with us.

We repeated our request to the manager and explained that we weren't trying to be difficult but seems like a fairly simple problem with a fairly simple solution.  So he gave us the line that if he makes an exception for us... then he needs to make an exception for everybody...  so again... we look around the restaurant to see the 4 or 5 other tables that were occupied which were all in the bar except for 1 couple finishing up a couple tables away from us.  I explained that there wasn't anyone else in the bar to worry about and thought it was silly that a \"manager\" cannot make a basic customer service decision like this.  He insisted that it was not possible....  So my wife and I debated whether we wanted to move to a new table or just leave.  Again... with 2 kids and a hot day... just decided to move to another table since we were starving.   

So we get a new waitress b/c it is her section and she chooses to make sarcastic remarks from the very beginning about us having issues.   Took our order and gave us the bare minimum in terms of service.   We had to flag down random people for drink refills and the food came out all at once (appetizers and main course)   Food wasn't prepared well... but what's the point of complaining at this point.  So we laughed it off... got sarcastic with the waitress towards the end... left her a big fat Zero for a tip and won't be back.  

It is crazy what a night and day difference the Red Rock location is versus the Henderson location.   And for what it's worth....  it seems that we get poor service at just about every restaurant at the Red Rock Casino which is disappointing b/c it is such a nice place.   But seriously.... 10 years I have been in town and probably 5 or 6 restaurants there have consistently bad service.  This has been the worst by far!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service every time.  Love the pulled pork sandwiches and the rib tips were pretty amazing.  My only complaint would be that the portion size is a little small for the price when compared to other BBQ places.  But one of my favorite spots in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Just simple... The best barbecue around especially in Vegas and almost beat St. Louis for some of the dishes.  

The beef ribs are outstanding.  

 Try the tri tip  is great and try those fried pickles."}
{"text":"The kind of place that everyone can find something to chow down on, Lucille's BBQ is popular with my extended family.  With a party of 11, we came here last night for my cousins' birthday dinner at their choosing.  Located at Red Rock Casino, there is a separate entrance to the restaurant so you don't even have to enter the casino unless you have to use the restroom because there aren't any in Lucille's. Reservations were made in advance and we were seated at a long table that accommodated all of us quite easily.  I've been to this location before with friends who also chose it for a celebration, it may have been a birthday, too, but I don't remember.  What I do like about this place is that the service is excellent.  I want to give a special shout-out to Miles, the staff member who was assigned to our table last night.  This guy took care of our larger group from beginning to end and was especially attentive to my littlest cousins who sat at one end of the table together.  Miles took their orders, crouching down to speak to them at their level and treated them, 7 and 9 year olds, with as much courtesy as he did the adults.  

As for the food, the menu is the huge kind with loads of choices.  We started off with their biscuits and apple butter that came out fresh and hot.  They're hard to resist so why try?  I had the BBQ half chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and sweet potato fries.  Between the chicken, some of the mashed potatoes, plus a biscuit, it was more than enough food for me and it was all good.  My son ate the fries which he requested because his pulled pork sandwich only came with one side and he wanted more.

Miles checked on us often and everyone had a satisfying meal. When I asked him to take a group picture of us at the end, Miles wanted to clear some of the table off first so it didn't look so trashed plus he took more than one picture:  this guy knows what he's doing.  I would definitely recommend this location if you're a fan of Lucille's for the wonderful service and hearty food."}
{"text":"Feeling uncomfortable ... Girl at front was a bit bitchy and made me feel like we were bothering here by wanting to eat
Staff took forever 
Just be prepared to wait


Update: came for dinner this time
What a difference 
No wait and smiles
No grumpies"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a large group at least a couple hours in advance. When we arrived it didn't seem like your typical over crowded Lucille's so our guess was we were going to be seated right away, NOT. 
    
       We waited for a good :30-:45 minutes before we were seated. Mind you our whole party was already there. I say that because some places won't seat you unless your whole party has arrived. 

   Once being seated everything returned to Lucille's normal. Waitresses were bringing us alcoholic drinks, bread (w/ their mouth watering apple butter) water, making sure we were accommodated until we were ready to order. One of the platters we ordered were the beef ribs. I don't know if I was that hungry or what, but I felt like I could just keep eating them and not get full. They were soooo good! I added some of their spicy BBQ sauce to them and it topped it off. I left there very pleased and so was my tummy."}
{"text":"Great service and a satisfying lunch salad- enjoyed the fried green tomatoes and dining on the patio.  generous portions will send you give with leftovers"}
{"text":"I don't understand the mentality of these places. They are definately not cheap. They are very pricey. Then you place your order and out comes the bagged food.
Our party ordered the fried green tomatoes and Okra for appetizers. Both had been frozen, poured out of a bag into a fryer. Served with a flavorless sauce. 
Of of my party ordered pulled pork sliders with greens. The greens were a canned green. WTF. I order the cheesey grits with my entree. They were flavorful and full of large lunps the size of peanuts. 

The meats were ho humm. Nothing to get overly excited by. The service was pretty lousey. Rarely saw our server (Kelly). 

Get it together people. You gonna charge high prices, you need to provide good quality. Not here!!!!"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed by this place! Was excited to try happy hour because there was a large happy hour menu with greats prices. 

Our table ordered the fried pickles, gumbo, deviled eggs and nachos. The nachos were horrible. Barely had any toppings and they use that gross fake nacho cheese. The rest of the food was SO salty...no one could finish eating anything due to the saltyness. Left hungry and disappointed :( Server never asked how the food was either."}
{"text":"We came here for my friend's rehearsal dinner.  It was buffet style and the first thing they had was salad.  I can't belive I ate a salad at a BBQ place but it took them like 2 hours to get the actual real food out, so I had to eat something.  Finally they bring us an appetizer sampler and we wolfed that down pretty quick.  Then we got some steak, but never did get any wings or variety of other meats.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Ah, Lucille, Lucille...

I'm not southern. I've only driven through the south once and I'm no BBQ connoisseur. But I know okey-pokey food when I taste it. Here is another one of my stories where my first visit or two were better than the most recent. Don't chain restaurants know they have to keep up the high standards to have a lasting chain?...The first few visits, around the time of its opening, the meal was great! I found the catfish burger to be my favorite at the time, but still wish it had a deal of a bit more flavor or seasoning, its quite bland. I love the fried okra, they don't burn it like my mother, so I'm happy. Had fried green tomatoes for the first time ever here and they were pretty good. But when I ordered a po'boy during my last visit was even bland-er than the catfish burger and was mostly bread. And my friends I was dining with that afternoon didn't really care for their dishes either, especially with the cost.

On a happier note, who doesn't love being served a drink out of a mason jar! Who knows, maybe you'll like the place...don't knock it until you try it, and if its a sub-par experience for you too, I'm sorry your money was wasted."}
{"text":"After attempting (and failing) to get a drink at a different bar in this center (*cough*san felipe*cough*), the husband and I ended up here. It was a Friday night and they had happy hour...awesome! The service was friendly, but a little slow considering they weren't terribly busy. I had the cucumber marg and the husband had the strawberry lemonade alcoholic concoction. Mine was good, it was on the 'skinny' list (less than 200 calories) and it was quite large, so that got it some points, but it tasted pretty alcohol -y, so that was a little drawback. The husband's drink was dangerously good.... sweet and didn't taste like alcohol at all. Anyway, our bill was like 12$ for two huge drinks.... forget the other bars in Tempe Marketplace, the next time I'm over there, I'll head here."}
{"text":"was freezing inside, service was horrible, food took forever to come out, and on top of that the food was cold."}
{"text":"Recent visit was disappointing. Mardi Gras Chicken was drenched in seasoning and overpowering. Manager quickly resolved the problem and prevented others from having the same experience."}
{"text":"I was stuffed to the brim after our meal. Came for a friend's birthday and ordered the Brisket Salad and the 1/2 sampler appetizer. Food was decent. My salad had great garnishes but the brisket was too dry and stringy. My friend got the brisket plate and it was super tender and delicious so I guess they don't put as much care into the salads. 

Sampler appetizer was awesome though. Fried pickles, okra, sweet potato fries, BBQ pork. They also serve their own beer. 

Service was really good, but the pricing was a bit high and the food wasn't the greatest."}
{"text":"I've been to Lucille's twice, the last time being August 17, 2010. I was part of a party of 9, with no reservations, around lunch time, and we literally had to wait less than 5 minutes. Snazzy.

I grew up in Oklahoma so I love the vibe I get from this restaurant. I honestly feel like I'm in a grandparent's home rather than a commercial restaurant. When I lived out there, I thought that people who served drinks in Mason jars were hicks and snubbed my nose when offered a drink out of them, but here, it feels a little quaint and I enjoy it. Funny how being a self-righteous snob works :-S I should work on that. 

Whoever came up with the design of this place has skills on lock. It's genius that there are coat racks at every booth so you don't have to mess with your purse or coat on the back of your chair. In the ladies' bathroom, there's purse hangers near every sink - I've never seen that before but it's awesome. 

On to the food. I'm not a biscuit person; I never have been. I've been told by tons of people that my mom is the queen of biscuit making but alas, I almost never eat any. I can't resist trying half a biscuit at Lucille's with their apple-butter. 

The meats here are delicious but their salads are just so-so. A small salad is way huge - larger than a Chili's salad. I can't imagine how large a \"regular\" salad would be. 

The service is fast and awesome and I love that they give you hot, and I mean HOT, wet towels to clean your hands after your meal, along with complimentary blow pops at the front of the house (lots of blues and reds - the best flavors!)"}
{"text":"This location is in The District and has outdoor seating with really cute lights hanging from the patio. I called and ordered food for take out and they said it would be 25 minutes. I showed up 25 minutes later to pick it up and had to wait another 20 minutes for my food when I arrived, which I was not too happy about. The girl that helped me was very nice so that made the waiting bearable. I ordered ribs, chicken, and a handful of sides. The ribs were pulled apart already when we opened the tray and I wasn't sure why, since that tends to make them get cold faster. The chicken was a bit on the dry side and the sides weren't very impressive. Overall, the food was decent but I don't think I would order take out from here again."}
{"text":"The tri tip sandwich is delicious. 

Sweet tea. Bread, honey butter. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Now this is great BBQ. I had eaten at the Las Vegas location and have been wanting to try this location for a while. Stopped in the for July 4th holiday and was not disappointed. I had the fried chicken plate and my husband had the beef brisket plate. Both were awesome. Back Porch Strawberry Lemonade is delish and refreshing. Everything was so good we took an order of chocolate cake home for dessert to enjoy later. The fun continued at home! The staff is super friendly. Greeted by everyone on the way in, our waiter was friendly and attentive, manager came by to check on us, and thanked at told good-bye by at least 5 employees on the way out. Service is superb!"}
{"text":"I find that when I come here, they seem to always been busy. There is not much of a waiting area either and the checkin desk becomes over crowded at most times and you can barely make your way to them to provide your party information. On this occasion, we had reservations which reduced our wait time. We were seated in one of time side rooms. Our waitress was attentive and drinks and orders were taken promptly. Food portions are well portioned, so come hungry! I had the shrimp salad which was delicious! Honestly, this place is usually hit or miss, food is always good, however service and large (loud) crowds can often put a damper on the dining experience. Parking is always an issue near the restaurant as well since it is located in the green valley district area."}
{"text":"I just had great service and a great meal! The atmosphere was awesome and I left in a really good mood. I will be back!"}
{"text":"After losing pocket aces at green valley ranch, I needed a place to get my hopes back up and lucilles sure did that.  AMAZING food and service.  The peanut slaw is to die for."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but we walked out very full.  Mardi gras chicken was great and chicken plus 2 meats was great - brisket pieces were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ baby back ribs as well as smoked chicken quesadilla. Place is popular as it's always packed. Took away a star for pricing- it's slightly on the higher side and I personally like the ribs a little more cooked. Still darn good place for a feed."}
{"text":"SUPER YUMMY! I'm not eating for days!  Peach lemonade is divine!! The one downside was the employees reacted as if they've never served someone with allergies before... My sister cannot have dairy and she told the server that multiple times, they brought the pulled pork out with no bun for her but brought her an ear of corn slathered in butter. The manager was super quick to get involved and get her a new one which was great, no harm done just be aware if you do have allergies to ask and ask again! Overall great experience really fun atmosphere and out of this world food!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food: my husband really liked the steak sandwich, but my original pulled pork sandwich was a little dry/salty. My daughter's hamburger was also dry and she refused to eat it. For appetizers we had the baby back ribs and fried green tomatoes which sat in a red sauce I didn't care for. The ribs were too sweet and jerky-like for me but happy was happy. The saving grace and high star rating was for the Best Chocolate Cake Ever which is a great name for it because it was! Big enough for 3 people to share. 

Service: I had to ask for refills and ketchup which was fine but I'd prefer they anticipate needs more. 

Location: conveniently located in The District and easy parking. 

I'd go again and order something else to eat, but definitely get the chocolate cake again. Or just come for dessert!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to enjoy good food with family and friends from out of town. Servers were friendly and attentive. The host was really nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"Came to watch the NFL game and sat in the bar. Our waiter, Aaron was so patient and on top of things. The food was delivered in record time, and our waiter was extremely understanding as we ordered our food while not taking our eyes off the game. Before we left he made sure we were completely satisfied . The food was exceptional, but the service was even more so. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I order the same thing every time I go here: baby back pork ribs and mash potatoes, with a peach lemonade. It's delicious. I prefer their original BBQ sauce, but the sweet & spicy one is good too. The only kicker is that the ribs can be dry sometimes. Hmm.

The service can also be a bit slow, but it's a casual spot... So bring friends and be prepared to hang out!"}
{"text":"We come to Lucile's on the regular!! It's an amazing restaurant they have great food. Although this last time we went there we got the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant by Lisa.  She didn't smile the whole time we were there and through out the whole meal not one plate was picked up.  We went for a birthday party and were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ribs are fantastic.  Tasty and tender baby backs, fried chicken and catfish.  Loved the greens and corn chowder.  Okra was all batter but biscuits w/cinnamon butter was a delicious touch.  Gr8 menu though a bit pricey.  Ambience and service was good w/appropriate music.  Family friendly."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, our waiter was awesome...the food was very good ...the only thing I thought was the prices are a little steep."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge meat eater, but at Lucille's, I turn rabid carnivore. I have to fight the urge to take down a cow by the hind haunches and eat it on the spot.  Whenever I'm in at the Green Valley Ranch, despite several excellent dining options, I have to eat at Lucilles.   They start with killer biscuits and apple butter, and their drinks come in massive Mason jars.  I usually get a chicken dish, and every single one has been sooooo tasty.  This past weekend, I got the Cajun Chicken sandwich and it was so good, I'm tempted to drive the five hours back to Vegas for it.  On previous visits, I've gotten the Po' Boy and the Southern Fried Chicken.  All are heart-cloggin' good!  I've heard that they have good desserts, but the portions are so big, that I've never been able to order one. 
The decor is corporate-country.  The seating isn't terribly comfortable and the restaurant is a little loud, so it's not a place to linger over your food.   There's usually a wait, unless you get there early.   After dinner, you can walk around the shops, or hit the casino for gambling or a movie."}
{"text":"Less than mediocre.  Macaroni and cheese is bland,  bbq chicken sandwich is dry and mostly bread. I gave it two stars because the staff was great but this was garbage bbq."}
{"text":"I love your food. I consider myself a BBQ snob, and I am never disappointed in the quality of the BBQ at Lucilles. At my most recent visit, however, I was so disappointed in the service!  I placed a take out order of two racks of Saint Louis ribs.  Your server, Renora did a great job - verified my order, no problem. I got my order and drove home. Unfortunately, when I got home and unpacked the bag, what I had received was two racks of baby back ribs. The boxes were labeled \"baby back\" and when I opened the box, that is in fact what they were.  I called and talked to Renora, who was again super helpful. She apologized for the mix up, verified that I had paid for the Saint Louis ribs and connected me to the manager. This is where everything fell to pieces. The manager (a woman, I didn't get her name) was rude, tried to argue with me that I don't know the difference between baby backs and Saints, and would not even acknowledged that a mix up was even a possibility. I don't understand her horrible attitude. I wasn't asking for my money back - just the difference in what I paid versus what I got. She was so rude and dismissive, I felt horrible for even calling. She made me feel like my buisness doesn't matter.  I know it was a super busy day - the place was packed, but I don't think that is an excuse for her behavior. Perhaps by sharing my experience you could provide her with some customer service training. I think she could use it. **** I tried to send this feedback to the Lucille's website, but it does not work, so I am airing my disappointment on YELP instead."}
{"text":"Ok i may be biased because i already know of Lucilles and have enjoyed their Ribs long ago in California.  Use to love to go for lunch and get the rib tips. BUT that was over 7 yrs ago. Since moving to Vegas Famous Daves are more around than Lucilles and driving to Henderson for happy hour isnt that appealing. SO such much excitement when i found out they were finally putting one at the Red Rock Casino location. SCORE you cant get no better than that.
So  this was my 2nd time to this location and i will say since its new there are some kinks that need and will be worked out. Love the Happy Hour specials just need to make sure the staff knows exactly what really on special and whats not.. dont like surprises on the bill, but manager fixed it so no problem. The biscuit was so hard i really scratched my friend as i rubbed it on her hand jokingly. They quickly gave me some soft fresh biscuits as we laughed about it.
As we sat at the bar area across from the smoker, i thought i was done ordering until they opened the smoker and all that deliciousness smell came drifting out along with slabs of mouth watering ribs.  Um waitress please add some rib tibs to my order please. OMG that the best thing ever. How could u pass it up after smelling it and seeing it pass by lol i couldnt. Yep its only been a few weeks. I got faith they will step it up and be even better. The atmosphere is great nice and comfortable. Will be going back and taking lots of friends."}
{"text":"Wow! this place is good Bar-B-Q, beef, chicken or pork! If you want to try a few things try the sample platter. it gives you a cross section of the various things. They have a choice of sauces that are great. The service is really good and they are well informed about what they serve. I have tried different things and have never been disappointed. It is comfortable dinning. I like the music too, a jazz motif and memorabilia. I like the peach ice tea served in a mason jar! I go to this place from time to time to treat myself or meet people to have dinner I know will like this type of food."}
{"text":"We went to Lucille's Smokehouse Bar-B-Que on 8/3/2012 at about 8 PM.  The decor was awesome and the wait was only 10 minutes without a reservation.

Service was a bit brusque but, hey, it was a Friday night.  Less forgivable was the dirty table.  The room was very loud but the music was good; and so we waited about 15 minutes for our drinks.

We ordered the \"Southern Fried Okra.\"it was OK. If you have never had real soul food or okra, you might like it.  But for anyone visiting Lucille's expecting down-home cookin, don't hold your breath.  It was left in the fyer too long and the oil needs changing.

Next up: the dinner biscuits and apple butter. Also very forgettable.  The biscuits were very doughy and pretty much just absorbed the saliva in my mouth.  Not sure if that was the goal to get me to buy some more overpriced iced tea....

House salads were underwhelming for the price and featured old lettuce, a dribble of dressing, and a whole lot of carrots. Apparently Lucille's knows how to mess up a HOUSE SALAD. Yep, now we're on a roll.

I got the half size \"New Orleans Gumbo.\" The top was congealed and was decorated with a blob of overlooked minute rice.  The presentation doesn't end there: there was a curious brown powder on the rice. I tried to smell this substance and discern what spice it might be, but, strangely, the dish had no real smell to it. Stranger yet, my \"gumbo\" had 3 pieces of shrimp in it.  The base of the dish tasted like a prepared packet of powdered brown gravy: sickeningly salty and bland.  Everything else in it was way overlooked and rubbery.

On a brighter side, my husband got the \"BBQ Tri Tip.\" I helped him with it since my meal was inedible and it was pretty awesome.  It was perfectly cooked and the Mop sauce that accompanied it was a great accompaniment.  A side note: his garlic mashed potatoes were devoid of any garlic, or taste for that matter.  Perhaps another powdered train-wreck: the only thing Lucille's did consistently."}
{"text":"We took my grandson here last night for his birthday celebration and I wish we had gone somewhere else. It was my first and last time to visit this restaurant.
I ordered the Brisket Nachos which the menu describes as being covered with sliced brisket. There was NO brisket on the plate and instead about 6 tiny pieces of something that resembled dried cat food; one teaspoon of sour cream and one teaspoon of guacamole and no black beans as described. I also ordered Onion Straws which arrived cold, limp and greasy. It took so long to get anybody including our waitress attention that everyone else had finished eating so obviously I had no dinner. I will add that I had a bite of one persons chicken and anothers bite of  ribs and both were very good but not good enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Pretty good here! Came here for happy hour a couple of times and they have a great selection .. The brisket sandwich is to die for!! Also love the different sauces you can use at the table to mix up every bite!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much in love with this place! I went with some friends and the hubs for dinner one night. Started with the strawberry lemonade and as always... soooo refreshing! The peach one is delicious too by the way. I ordered the half smoked chicken with a side of greens & corn bread. It was so filling! I couldn't really eat the greens because it had too much bits of pork in there. The flavor was great though. The chicken was nicely smoked, juicy and super tender. Would definitely get that again. I ordered a side of the fried okra too because I love my okra. I would definitely recommend it! Our server \"house\" was so awesome. His real name is Justin and he was just on top of things when it comes to making us comfortable and letting us know what's up. He brought out a good amount of the biscuits and the apple butter. Uhhhh.. heaven! Lol! Love that stuff. Everything was great and you really can't go wrong with the bbq. Excited to get some more lemonade! Generous amount of it in a serving :) happy eating my Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Mckenzi was amazing at the bar! Will be back soon! Too bad Cassidy wasn't here ... she's way awesome too!"}
{"text":"We came on a very busy night and phoned ahead to reserve seating.  We were told 45 min wait and when we got there it was down to 20 min.  We decided to get a drink in the bar while we waited and boy did we wait!!! We waited about 5 min, a waitress walked by and said ill be right with you. After another 5 minutes she dropped off menus rushed next to the couple that sat after us and took their drink order and then ran off again for another 5 minutes. She finally comes by and we tell her we just want to Order a drink.  She runs off and this time is fairly decent at coming back with a drink and we ask for the check right away afraid that we won't see her again. She brings us the check and by this time our table is called.  By the time we get the check it took about 25 min to get one drink from the bar.... 
The food is a bit pricey but comes in very large quantities so take the leftovers home and its worth the money. Dinner for two cost $50. It southern style so if you like that type of food you have a lot of options. When it comes time to pay the check my husband realized the bar waitress still had his credit card. Why did she not bring it to him since she knew we were dining in???   I know that busy nights are difficult but a little courtesy goes a long way."}
{"text":"Just left Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ in Henderson and let me say the food and service was seriously lacking.  We came for a \"late\" dinner around 8:30pm and all the servers either seemed too busy trying to clean for the restaurant closing (which wasn't until 10pm) or never returned with anything we asked for.  There were times where we asked two different servers about something we had ordered and neither remembered to bring it. Terrible!  Also we noticed after sitting there for a while and observing other patrons munching on biscuits, that our waiter didn't even bring us any and when we asked about it he didn't apologize or anything.

As far as the food goes, I've had meals at Jack in the Box and Wendy's with more flavor.  I ordered the the appetizer sampler and everything (minus the onion strings) was very bland and all our their sauces were a miss.  The three signature bbq sauces were not that good (one was waaaaay too sweet, the other was too peppery, and the third was tolerable).  I was also disappointed in the cuts of meat that I got too.  There was too much fat and not enough tender rib meat.

I'm not sure if they were having an off night here or what, but between the service (or lack thereof) that we received and the lack of even ONE good quality bbq sauce, I don't think I will be returning.  For bbq, I'm just going to stick with Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"let me start with this: I hate bad service. I mean I really HATE it... I am tired of server's who don't get customer service.  At the end of the day, the food is pretty good but the service there is mediocre to horrible depending on when you're there.  I don't think I will be going back there."}
{"text":"They're feast is pretty amazing. It's definitely a meat lovers delight. You can chose what you want but chicken, brisket and ribs are the favs for most. For carb lovers: the mashed potatoes, sweet potato fries, and Mac and cheese would be a great addition. Service is good, but servicing a party of 12 is hard for one person."}
{"text":"Simply Amazing! Best ribs I ever had! I opted for the coleslaw as one of my sides and it was fresh, crisp and the perfect addition to their ribs. The service was awesome! I will be back every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you have a group over 4. Our meal took 3 hours. This is sad given we go here every year for my brother in law's birthday. This will sadly be the last. The service was very poor.  The place was clearly understaffed.  Our poor waiter was trying to keep up with far too many tables in his section. Wouldn't be so bad if we didn't watch the manager sit and do nothing for 3 hours. Oh except  come over to our table and apologize that half our food came out cold, including the birthday boy's.  Two stars because food is still good cold.  There's a lot more places to choose from at Tempe Market Place, we will be choosing somewhere else next time we want BBQ."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!  Went for late happy hour and was treated to good food, good beer and great prices.  They also had live music for an added bonus.  The only disappointment in the food department was the rib tips.  They were a bit dry and not a great deal for the price.  Other than that, everything else was good.  

The atmosphere was another pleasant surprise.  The decor makes you feel as if you were in the South, without the bugs and humidity."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they open. And I've never been disappointed just had the Gumbo and it's amazing super dark yummy goodness my wife had the awesome beef ribs which you can never go wrong with amazing place"}
{"text":"Went there for their Thanksgiving meal and it was so good that we went back to try the regular dishes. The beef brisket is tasty, the biscuits melt in your mouth, the ribs are awesome. The service is really good. Pricey."}
{"text":"OMGEEE!!!!

This place, wow!!!! Yummy yummy yummy in my tummy! We went in late night on a Friday the front area was closed but the back was open for business. Our server was very attentive and knew the menu. He had great recommendations for our taste preference. I hade the jalapeño spicy burger and my spouse had the bacon burger. Both burgers were outstanding to say the least. We started with the on the house butter biscuits too, they had sugar on top and tasted like heaven. We pretty much went into a food coma after this night out. 

Check this place out you will NOT be disappointed!!!! 

Oh and try the spicy BBQ hot sauce they sell, I took two home, yum and yum, I love spicy and this hit the spot."}
{"text":"Did NOT enjoy my dining experience here! Our server Roberto was on hardly attentive. It took him 10 minutes to greet us and another 10 minutes to bring our drinks. It was 10pm and not even close to busy. He never even bothered to clear our table. The BBQ was OK. The tri-tip was overcooked and the brisket was tough. I won't be back! To anyone looking to enjoy good service and BBQ, I would recommend dining at Famous Dave's. Much better value all the way around!"}
{"text":"This is on the expensive side.  The food is ok,
I have used their carry out service for an event and that worked out well.  It is hard to go there with large parties"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 4 stars because even though the service wasn't the best and I'm,not a big pork fan, everyone I was with enjoyed their food. Our waitress had a perky personality and was great... It just took forever to get anything from refills to our check. And we could hear them telling customers walking in that's it'd be an hour and a half wait... I get why. I just think it may be understaffed for how liked of a place it is. Because it was packed. 
We started with an artichoke thing and if you like fatty artichokes this isn't the place to get one. It barely had any meat on it. But I had chicken tenders, which is my go to when I go somewhere I don't really like their whole menu type of thing (I don't like pork what so ever, but it wasn't my choice). And normally I don't have an issue with chicken but this was almost sweet and I only ate a small portion. I got mashed potatos and corn bread on the side because well.. I'm at a bbq place!! Which both were great. My dad had ribs and ate every last bit. My grandma had a pulled pork sandwich which she enjoyed. It was overall ok, not somewhere I would eat because I don't like pork but everyone else enjoyed it(:"}
{"text":"I like the theme and of course, the soundtrack is a winner for anyone who appreciates the Blues. On both visits I've had the Original Pulled Pork Sandwich. The Baked Beans are no joke. You'll be pleased with that as your side dish. Food portions are above average. The service, eh, mediocre. But the other aspects of the visit overcome. I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Here's what I don't get about Lucille's, and hopefully someone from there can clarify for me. We only go to Lucille's for lunch.  In the past, we were told that they serve off the lunch menu on weekends, and we used that menu.  Lately, I've been given the dinner menu on weekends and holidays .  When I ask, sometimes they get me the lunch menu and sometimes they say, \"We don't do it on weekends, holidays, etc.\"  Last time I asked if I could have the lunch menu on Veterans Day and they said no.  I asked the server to check with the manager, and the they brought me the lunch menu.  What's the deal?  The dinner portions are too big for lunch, and the price is much more doable for lunch.  Having said that, the food is outstanding, especially the fried seafood platter with shrimp and fish.  They're still making money by letting people order lunch during lunchtime. Anyone know the truth?"}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch with a friend. Ordered a watermelon ice tea which was pretty tasty. Never had that before so I enjoyed it.

The bar area was empty when we entered so we sat here. It quickly filled up. A steady stream of customers throughout our stay (we watched the afternoon football games here). 

For food - we ordered the brisket sliders, rib tips, and baked artichoke appetizers.

 The brisket sliders had too much sauce on them, and it was a bit spicy. Could not taste the brisket. Not recommended. 3/10

Rib tips were meaty and good. Again, too much sauce to cover up the flavor of the actual smoky goodness of the ribs. 5/10

Baked artichoke was overcooked, and also covered with so much garlic that it didn't quite taste good. I love artichokes, but this one neither of us finished a half. 2/10.

Overall, the restaurant is nice, our bartender/server was nice...but the food just lacks that great BBQ flavor. There isn't a great BBQ place in Vegas, and Lucille's just falls in with the other mediocre places."}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 4 stars
Glass wear was clean, and table was free of debris.. However the floor could use some attention. The highchair was in desperate need of some cleaning, definitely nasty to ask my child to sit in..

Food: 2 stars
Bottom line, I have had more tender and flavorful meats at my local soul food BBQ shop. The price point is way to high for the portions and food quality.

Hospitality: 3 stars
Nice enough, but also forgetful enough to leave drinks empty and not get basic orders correct. If your a waiter and need to write our order down, I would rather see that than a person too prideful and mess up a good family meal."}
{"text":"great BBQ great service my fav is tri tip sandwich ribs also great and love the sauces!!!"}
{"text":"I had the brisket salad, mac and cheese, and the baked beans. Ohhh and of course that delicious crumbly yet light and fluffy biscuit! 
The biscuit was SO good I didn't need any butter for it. 
The beans were not what I was expecting but I really enjoyed them. They were sweet with a little kick to them. 
Unfortunately I did not like the mac and cheese but I was going to take it home because I hate returning food but without hesitation, he offered to remove it from my bill. Ummm yes! 
Lastly the salad was good. The brisket was moist yet had a nice chew to it and the salad dressing was enjoyable. If I lived here I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We had made reservations for Thanksgiving dinner over two weeks ago.  Our reservations were for 4:30 pm.  After we were seated the waiter had said they had ran out of Turkey because of the expected outside orders around 3:00 pm; however the good news was they now had more Turkey.  We put our orders in for the Thanksgiving Turkey dinners.  Within ten minutes another waiter came to inform us that there wasn't any Turkey.  That they had not expected the high volume of take out orders.  We decided to stay since we there and we were already seated and our drinks had been order.   We realize that waiters were not at fault.  Some folks got up and left.  Some others were annoyed and complained.  The management did not offer a discount or even a complimentary piece of pie.  I felt that the management were aware of the reservations that had been made.  They were also aware of all of the orders for pick up that had been placed.  They had not planned accordingly.  By the time we left they had even ran out of ham.   
We have had our Thanksgiving dinner there for the past three years.  However we will not plan to have it there again."}
{"text":"Lucille's was delicious!  The had an array of items to choose from.  I stopped in for lunch and ordered the cajun chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries.  They also serve hot towels afterwards.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a place I don't go often enough.  Great southern charm, and comfort food.  Get the peach lemonade."}
{"text":"Came back for a second try. Glad I did.  I sat at bar. Was helped by Jessica. Very friendly and accommodating.  Sausage sampler. The beef was spicey and delicious. Really nice flavor. Want crazy about the cheese sausage.  Ask them not to put the BBQ sauce on it. Masks the flavor of the meats. 
Had the rib tips and St. Louis ribs. Not dried out this time.  Had the greens and Mac and cheese. Again not great. Greens were limp and destroyed. Mac was just put in the salamander and melted cheese over the overly creamy elbows. They need to flavor it up and thicken it. Maybe add an egg and some cayenne or sriachi. She brought me out the peanut Coke slaw and cheese grits. The jalapeño in the cheese grits was tasty but they could get that same heat with a better pepper.  Overall I enjoyed it much more and will come back to try the huge beef ribs I saw."}
{"text":"I'm really happy to say that my 2nd trip back here was much better.  I had to have the brisket again and the hot links.  My girl gave the St. Louis ribs another shot.  I guess that first time I went, they had a bad day in the kitchen.  These ribs were much fattier.  Smoke was great.  I'm glad I came back.  

Service was never an issue in the first trip, and was great again this time around.  I'm glad I came back."}
{"text":"Pretty good, they do have beef ribs which is nice. I prefer more local bbq joints to chain places but they are good.  If you go at 3 you can double up on happy hour and lunch if you sit in the lounge.  Super great staff everytime I've been there."}
{"text":"We sat down around six and our food didn't come until 7:15 or so, which has been our experience every time we've been here. The tri-tip sandwich is excellent, as is the brisket. The sausages were gross and my grandma thought the chicken in her salad was too dry. My kids didn't care for their pizza and I didn't blame them- it was like cafeteria pizza. My brother had country fried chicken and said it was meh."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! I love their ribs and the Mac & cheese is a favorite also. I've ate here multiple times and never had a bad experience. When your done you can play at the RedRock Resort."}
{"text":"I came here a few months back to catch up with an old co-worker.  We were seated right away but the service could be better considering it was a slow night.  While the biscuits with apple butter were delicious, everything else seemed to be standard affair.  

My friend and I started with an order of fried pickles which ended up being overly salty.  For my entree, I ordered the brisket with sweet potato mash and cheese grits.  My friend had the ribs.  The portions were big and everything was hot and steamy but my brisket ended up being really dry and tough.  After slapping on some more bbq sauce, I was able to choke it down.  The sweet potato mash was delicious and the cheesy grits really hit the spot.  My friend had said his ribs were great so perhaps it just wasn't the right night for brisket and fried pickles.  Boo hoo!

I give Lucille's 3.5 stars at best.  There are plenty of other BBQ joints around the Chandler area that are more impressive and Lucille's just pales in comparison.

_____________________________________________

Side-Note:  I received a lovely message from the owner of Lucille's today to give them a second-try on the house.  While I appreciate their gracious offer, I must decline.  I thank the owner for his generosity though.  I admire his work ethics on trying to make sure all his customers are happy!  Very classy, sir.  Kudos for trying to kiss and make up!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I hurt my stomach but it was SO WORTH IT! This has got to be the best barbecue I have ever had. The sauce is SO sweet. The ribs are HUGE. OMG I cant give this place enough stars! Lucille, you've definitely won our hearts even as you kill our waistlines. LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I hate to rain on everyone's 5-star parade, but this place blows. It came highly recommended, not only from people I work with, but apparently the Vegas majority. And, oh, how very disappointed I was...
Where to begin?! Let's start with the service... I generally believe if you have decent service and a bad meal or bad service but a great meal it can be balanced out to an overall average review. However, when you strike gold and get both terrible service and subpar food--what are you left with? In my case, a review on Yelp. 
And now I'm going to be that catty bitch that uses names... Julie, maybe you were having a rough night. Maybe your boyfriend dumped you or your boss made you pull a double. The fact is, I don't give a shit. You were rude, unwelcoming and a TERRIBLE waitress. I ordered a water with lemon to start. A drink menu was no where to be seen so our options were limited--would we like a lemonade? Possibly, but we don't know what you have on your menu because you've already left us to get our waters. Except 10 minutes later we still don't have water. And when we do, there's no lemon in it. A minor detail, I know... and really, I can get over this if you had managed to get anything else right. You put the cherry on the icing when I asked for a lemon and you tell me it's going to be a minute. Ok--because you're growing them out back? Because you have to cut it with the shards of glass you're going to remove from your ass since clearly you have something stuck up there? Whatever, you pissed me off... 
To the food... you bring out some biscuits with apple butter. This excites me, except the biscuits were flavorless and there was no amount of butter to help this. I order the soup and sandwich combo with the loaded potato soup and  1/2 a chicken sandwich. The soup was spicy but didn't have a ton of flavor. And loaded? If by loaded you mean basically a white broth with tons of pepper in it, then yes, it was loaded. I'm still waiting for the cheese and bacon to come in somewhere...I order the chicken sandwich plain thinking I'll douse the warm chicken in BBQ sauce and then eat the bread. I tell Julie this, but alas, she doesn't hear me. She hasn't heard a damn thing I've said tonight.... So the sandwich comes and the chicken is cold. On Texas toast. With loads of mayo, tomatoes and lettuce. Um, NO. Every other sandwich on the menu is warm and comes on a bun--WTF? I tell Julie I'm not pleased and she stands there looking at me and then asks if I want something else. I say I'll think about it and she leaves NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN! Or until I've picked my way through my sandwich and just want to go home. You come by to remove our plates and ask if we want dessert. I had been contemplating key lime cheesecake because I'm a sucker for all things key lime... but I'm pissy and head to the restroom. While I'm there, husband orders key lime to go and the check. You grab the check with our credit card and run it in record time and tell us to have a good night--except we've yet to receive the key lime pie. No, this feat would take you an additional 10 minutes to get. Because apparently, the only thing you can do in record time is make me want to leave. 
Overall, I think this place is highly overrated. If in the mood for BBQ, this will be the last joint I ever recommend or go to. Lucille's--you get ONE star because my husband liked his ham sandwich. I would take this away for the awful service but I'm not that mean...."}
{"text":"Laid back, but great service, great food.  Glad I drove a little bit to check out this place."}
{"text":"Katie our server was great, she blabbed on about smoking meat and sausages but was very attentive and pleasant. The riiibs were great and came out very quick, everything was good grub and grog"}
{"text":"Wife asked for ribs, we have not had since moving from DC.  Found Lucille's online and proceeded to order online which was very easy.  Food was ready when I arrived and check out was a breeze.  Staff was friendly.  A tip for visitors, insist on FRESH biscuits.  Mine were a little hard by the time they got home and not as good as they could have been.

Everything else was divine!  Baby back ribs, St. Louis rib tips appetizer, mac and cheese off the chains and cornbread (YUM).  We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Excellent BBQ, lots of choices. Their drinks are amazing! I really would say this place is my top fav for family restaurants in vegas. I bring all my friends here and they fall in love as well."}
{"text":"First time for happy hour at Flying Pig.
Friendly staff but biscuits were rock
Hard, ribs and pulled pork were tough!
This was disappointing and maybe just an off day."}
{"text":"The service was slow.  Two people had beef brisket with mushrooms was nothing to write home about I had pulled pork and was disappointed. I will go to famous dave's or honey bears next time even waldos"}
{"text":"The beef ribs were so good, I came back the next day for them. 
Baby back ribs- 2 stars. I did not like them too much.
Beef ribs- 5 stars 
Shoestring onion- 5 stars. So gooooood.
The bread at the beginning- 1 star. 
Cornbread- 2 stars.
BBQ beans- 5 stars.
Sweet potato fries- 5 stars. Probably the best I've ever had. 
Peanut slaw- 4 stars. 
Spicy sausage- 5 stars. 


I wish I could have tried their desserts and the fried green tomatoes, but I was too full. Next time!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a couple weeks ago.  Easily, the best BBQ that I have had in vegas, possibly the best BBQ I have had anywhere.  I want my baby back, baby back, baby back ribs.  I had a lunch combo with Burnt Ends, Baby Back Ribs, and Tri-Tip.  All were fantastic, but those ribs were the money maker.  I wish that I had discovered Lucille's earlier, it was so good!

If you are around near one, try it out, and GET THE COMBO!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times and have had pretty good experiences but Monday night I went in and had such a bad experience. Pretty poor service, in fact, some of the worst I've had. It was like we weren't even there at all. We ordered drinks and it was like automatic confusion. The server who we ordered them from left and never brought them but 10 minutes later someone else asked us if we wanted drinks so we reordered and they came in another 5 minutes. Then after awhile, another person took our order and I ordered a salad 1st and specifically asked for it 1st and it never came. When our meals came, I told the 4th person we spoke to to cancel my salad. My friend ordered the corn and asked for extra butter for it. It never came so we stopped a server (#5) and asked for melted butter. He said \"no problem\"! But....never returned. We flagged down a female manager who apologized and went to get it. By the time my friend got butter, the corn was cold. We were there for approximately 1hr and 30 min and I got burnt ends and iced t and my friend got a tri tip sandwich and an iced t. Simply ridiculous. Never was asked about appetizers, never asked if we wanted dessert and never were we checked on during the meal. It's a good thing there are so many restaurants within a 5  miles radius because I certainly don't need to spend my hard earned money here."}
{"text":"The music alone ... incredible Blues, wins it 5 stars!  The food is absolutely delicious!!  The burger had great flavor and crunch and the shoestring fries were amazing!! I especially loved the fried okra and the dips. The cocktails are large and beautiful and strong. The service was so warm and kind (thank you Travis!!) and they have a great happy hour!! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a delicious place for their BBQ.  The food that I come here for is only for their BBQ chicken and their Ribs.  It is so good and I love being allowed to put as much BBQ sauce as I want.   Other things that I have tried out, such as the beef brisket, potato salad, macaroni and cheese, greens medley, and corn,  are nothing great in my opinion. I still come for the BBQ though, especially during their happy hour."}
{"text":"I don't care how many interior designers you hired to hodge-podge together your \"authentic\" Southern décor, Lucille. Your screen door opens onto a suburban mall parking lot. 

Porch chairs from the '40s, old-timey chandeliers and your great aunt's wallpaper. The only thing missing from this fake Old South experience is a whites-only drinking fountain. Guess the marketing folks thought that might be just a bit *too* authentic.

The other thing missing? Flavor. Sure, you heap on the sides and your fried green tomatoes are tasty, but this pulled pork is dry and boring, there's too much sugary crap in my cocktail and my biscuit is like a butter-covered rock. 

Might I add: You mention \"St. Louis-style\" left and right, which I do believe is north of the Mason-Dixon line. So unless you want to argue the effects of the Missouri Compromise, I'm pretty sure St. Louis ain't part of the South you're trying reeeeeal hard to imitate. Even more baffling, your website says the original Lucille got all her recipes from her grandma in Greenville. So which is it? 

It's neither. It's a corporate creation myth written by some copywriter in an office park in Thousand Oaks who was told to make the brand \"feel real.\"

And it does feel real. Real boring."}
{"text":"Great food and good atmosphere but tonight service was bad. So that happens but your waiter should not take a dinner break and not cover there customers. Started strong never saw him until the check!"}
{"text":"Because our first visit was amazing, we went back for a second time only a week after.

The second time wasn't as great as the first. Our bartender didn't seem as genuine as we would have hoped. This could have been perhaps she didn't think we were locals, but I guess that could be expected in a casino restaurant. 

We also noticed that the restaurant doesn't have a restroom! You have to walk into the casino to use the facilities :( 

Beef ribs were much more fatty that I had remembered and because our last visit was so great, we didn't realize that this place is pretty expensive!

We'll be back, but be much more picky about our visits."}
{"text":"Came here because it was within a 5 mile radius from our hotel..hahaha! Long story.  ANYWAY, we went twice.  The first time on a busy Saturday night--service was great..food was amazing..and the lemonade was tasty tasty.  Went back on a Thursday night and meh at best...service was blah..food was meh..and just not what it had been on the weekend when the place was PACKED! So..that's that...pry won't be back since sooo many other choices.  But, if we do go back, it will DEF be on a weekend."}
{"text":"My dad & brother enjoyed ale & Boston loger. Great food: the biscuits are different than any other I've had.. they're good (w/cinnamon & sugar). Tri tip, mac & cheese, & the bbq burger are all yummy. Had an awesome server: Joe. Love the spaciousness & the art on the walls. :)"}
{"text":"Went here about a year ago when in town for Cubs spring training. My sister and I were looking for a place to eat after the Cubs game.  When drove past Lucille' and it smelled so good... I am gluten sensitive and quickly checked my GF app to see if I could eat there... Was excited to see that they were listed on the app and we went... The food was so good, great unique sides to go along with the outstanding Ribs... Good drinks as well.. We need a Lucille's BBQ in the Chicago area."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful vibrance, delicious fold and amazing food! I enjoyed it a lot! Thanks!"}
{"text":"My son & daughter and their families took me to Lucille's for a surprise birthday dinner. This was my first time there, but my daughter & family  had eaten there before. We had 9 in our party and no one had any problems with the service or food, everything was \"great\"! I grew up in Texas where BarBQue is King, but the food at Lucille's is as good or better. I had their fried okra, the best I've ever eaten! I also had the smoked beef brisket, it was so gooood. Their sweeten iced tea comes with mint and served in a gigantic mason jar, the flavor was unbeatable. I look forward to going back again the next time in Henderson."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was meh, atmosphere was crowded! Overall it was good!! Waitress needed more experience..."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here in a while, but I just have to say this: BBQ Chicken Sandwich: THE BEST!
(Now I just made myself crave it! Dang! I guess I will have to hit it this weekend!)"}
{"text":"My favorite place for ribs. Sides are pretty good as well. Food is heavy which i like. Always have a good time here."}
{"text":"What a great place for a fun eat out with family and friends. I had the shrimp and grits and hub had the salmon. Both were really good! The grits and collard greens were beautifully cooked. This ambiance is fun with good music and plenty of tvs so hub didn't miss the game. Service was really good. Definitetly give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour. Food was ok. Prices could be a little lower for HH though. HH was from 9pm to close. They had a small band playing on stage. It was nice to listen to them play. Service was good. Im sure Ill come back and try it again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Lunch was good but nothing i would rave about. BUT I'm also not a BBQ fan.  My hubby is and why we went.  He did rave about the different kinds of BBQ sauces on the table and enjoyed all. Service was fast and attentive."}
{"text":"My uncle who lives in Vegas has been raving about this place ever since they opened. I recently got a chance to eat their during a visit this summer.

Man does this place get packed!!! Be smart, go to the bar order some drinks then take a seat at one of the tables when they open up. Much faster than waiting for a regular table. 

If you go during happy hour on Friday or Saturday, be prepare for some loud music. We were treated to a nice blues band during our dining experience, but it was loud.

The barbeque is just okay and nothing to rave about. But their Gumbo hit the spot and was delicious. I was so glad that I ordered this instead of the ribs or the chicken."}
{"text":"I've never been much of a ribs or BBQ person in general. Now I'm a vegetarian, so the fact that I really like Lucille's is a little bit strange, I guess. But their Garden Burger and their Portobello Mushroom Burger are really delicious. The side options are all also really yummy--and vegetarians usually have to rely on sides at BBQ and steak places. The carnivores in my family seem to enjoy all the meat stuff. My son loves the ribs. My husband loves the burgers and the brisket. My parents love the BBQ chicken. The service is usually pretty good--more often good than bad. The worst experience I've ever had there was with our kids and some friends and their small child on a Saturday--apparently live music night--where we got seated literally right next to the band. It made family dinner conversation a little challenging. But, hey, the food was good!"}
{"text":"This California-based BBQ chain is very good, but not the best in Vegas. Go to Memphis Championship BBQ for that. Lucille's excels where their competition does not in that it has an excellent outdoor dining area, a live band, good bar scene, and lively ambiance. 

Their food is dynamic and overall good, but the one drawback is that it lacks BBQ authenticity and identity. For example, there are three BBQ sauces to choose from: Texas, Memphis, and Spicy House Blend. Don't get me wrong, Lucille's should be on your list of spots to go in Vegas, but expect more of your typical commercialized BBQ chain fare California style than a rustic, authentic spot in Memphis or Texas."}
{"text":"The ribs here haven't been beat by any other BBQ restaurants in Vegas, and believe me I have tried. Mr. Texas with the last review below me doesn't seem to think so but for being a west coast kid this is great. The sides are standard sizes and the meats are cooked to perfection. I love eating here and will continue to have this be my top BBQ spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"The sweet tea was really sweet.  It was good, but it shouldn't be that sweet.  I had the BBQ Lunch Platter with creamy cheese grits.  I selected the baby back ribs, beef brisket and tri tip.  The baby back were great, soft and juicy.  The beef brisket was a little tough and chewy.  The tri tip was good.  I also tried the chicken and it was excellent.  The BBQ sauce on the meats was sweet.  Just like the sweet tea, it didn't have to be too sweet.  The waitress was very nice and the ambiance was quite homy.  Oh, also we had the onion straw's for our appetizer.  That was very good.  It was a lot of food.  Over all is what a good lunch.  ;o)"}
{"text":"Food's delicious, service sucks. The ribs are always fresh and tender with the meat falling off the bone. The appetizers you get are gigantic and easily shareable if you have a larger party. The brisket is also quite good and tender, and they offer a variety of sauces from mild to insanely hot. The service however is nothing to brag about. Waiters seem unattentive and I find myself having to ask other staff for things I need such as drink refills. In summary: kitchen keep doing your thing, waiters need to get back to training."}
{"text":"It's good...it's real good. The bisquits are what keep me coming to this place. The Bbq is so good and I am not a big fan of Bbq. Ask for the Peach Muddy Waters it's the business (half tea, half lemonade, and I'm guessing peach syrup)."}
{"text":"Its been 8 months since I've been to Lucille's and the great customer experience I experienced my first trip appear to be a thing of the past.

I was expecting to wait 30 to 40 minutes so having to wait 55 minutes wasn't really an issue for me. However it did allow me to witness an employee picking cigarette butts out of an ashtray with his bare hands.

I'm sure he washed hands when he went inside but he had to open the door with his bare hands and god knows what else he touched between the door and the faucet.

Once we were finally seated our server disappeared for 15 minutes and I had to flag down someone different in order to place a drink order.

When our server finally arrived we placed an order for an appetizer. It was delivered by a third person who threw the plate on our table and it slid across almost to the wall she announced fried green tomatoes and walked away.

No Silverware, no napkins so I got up and hunted down our server asked for some to be brought over so we could eat our tomatoes.  Was told sorry we ran out. How does a properly managed restaurant run out of Silverware? (It doesn't) the Server sent someone over with some silverware but it was given to the booth behind us who didn't have any food on their table! 

So we have been there more than an hour an a half didn't have silverware and we didn't have drinks.

Once our silverware arrived the tomatoes were a little bland but the sauce made up for the lack of flavor in them. 

When We finally got around to place an order I asked for an extra corn bread muffin and a side of Mac and Cheese these are both on the of side order menu and  should not have been too difficult but I had to ask twice for them to get delivered so I could eat them with my meal.

The manager did come over and apologized for our experience and offered to take some of the items off our bill but when the bill arrived everything was still on it.

I considered calling him over and pointing that out but figured it would be easier just to pay for everything and call it a night.

It may just be another 8 months till I come back for that delicious Blacken Catfish but I will be back eventually once the memory of last night fades away."}
{"text":"There are many long reviews of this place on here.  I'll make mine short.

Good service.  Good portions.  Average food."}
{"text":"i gotta admit, i didnt think i was gonna like this place. my husband loves smoked bbq anything and i knew he was gonna love it here so i reluctantly agreed to go here for dinner. 

thank God i agreed to eat here with him because the food here is unbelievably delicious. EVERYTHING. everything i stuck in my mouth was yummy. from the complimentary biscuits you get (with the most aMAZing apple butter. you might wanna see if you can get some extra because i sure wish i did) after you order, down to the banana pudding with nilla wafers and bananas. 

ive never had fried okra so we ordered that and the fried green tomatoes as our appitizers. okra doesnt have the best reputation but after trying it here, it is VERY popular in my book. YUM. i would like to have more right now as im writing this review. it came with 2 different sauces (ranch and a dijon mustard) but i prefered the ranch sauce. yum. we also ordered the cornbread which was just the right consistancy. it didnt fall apart when you cut into it with your fork. the fried green tomatoes were also delicious and it came with some red pepper sauce. yum. i cant stop saying that. 

for the main course i had the bbq tri tip sandwich with extra crispy sweet potato fries. holy moly, the meat in this sandwich was SO soft, i couldnt get enough. probably one of the best sandwiches ive ever eaten. and im really not big on the bbq. but dang, the flavors in this sandwich were unreal. and the fries!? they were actually extra crispy! thank God because i hate soft fries! my husband had the jambalaya which he loved. 

dessert....we HAD to have dessert. even tho we were so full from all the other food we had just eaten. we had the banana pudding which came with lots of nilla wafers and bananas inside. we didnt think we would be able to finish the entire thing because like i said, we were full. BUT the dessert was SO good. we ate it all. and became stuffed. so stuffed i had to do a couple laps around the shopping area after we were done eating.

bring an empty stomach. because youre gonna need it with all the things youre gonna wanna try here. and save room for dessert. definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite of mine but today I had the most awesome service from Lindy one of the hosts and her managers. When I ordered the wrong sandwich for takeout, they worked efficiently and quickly to make sure I was refunded the difference and got my new sandwich out for me as quickly as possible! #awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is amazing, The ribs, my god, the ribs. You leave very full and happy. I love the hot towel they give at the end of the meal. The briskets and sweet butter are so good. I always bring some home to have with coffee the next morning. I love the fried pickle chips! Very kid friendly. I always look forward to eating here."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is horrible furthermore the manager is even worse..Cecilia the day bartender has no comon courtesy..Vegas is a town built on customer service at this bar there is none. Ashley the manager does not know a thing about customer service.."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good I wood go back, chicken was dry but ribs are on point as well as the onion strips...
Don't expect much if your bringing someone for a birthday dinner ... no song nada ...
Kinds pricey not my first choice but 2nd maybe"}
{"text":"Er mer gerd!!! Absolutely delicious. My catfish was just okay, but my husbands rib, chicken, and tri tip platter was amazing! Those ribs were falling apart and super juicy. The corn chowder was delish, and so were the fried green tomatoes. My son absolutely loved his food, and  got to ring the restaurant bell, lol. Very pleased. The waitress and everyone were friendly and fast with our food. We will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Wow!  The food here was great.  I ordered the tri tip with 2 sides (mac and cheese and shoestring fries) and oooooh man was it good.  Whats also nice about this place is they have their different BBQ sauces out on the table for you so you can taste them all.  If that wasn't good you can even buy it from their store inside!  Luckily the two bottles I bought survived the flight home."}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue, with fast and friendly service! I got my food out in less then 15mins and had decently strong dosed beverages. Tvs at the bar which is nice to watch the olympics. The floor manager Desserey came out and made sure that I received excellent service."}
{"text":"We think that Lucille's serves wonderful BBQ with an excellent and varied menu.  We've tried many menu offerings and have never been disappointed with the quality and taste of each item.  Of course, the ribs are excellent and the portions are generous.

The Happy Hour menu is also very good and reasonable.  Have also found that service is pretty good as well.  We usually eat in the bar and love the atmosphere and music when provided.  Not a place for those demanding quite during their restaurant experience.

We've had BBQ all over the country and Lucille's is as good as any we've tried."}
{"text":"I come time and time again knowing that the food is gross. I just keep hoping a change in cooks Or menu or something will boost this place up. This round I ordered a Caesar chicken salad which honestly the pre made bag from Albertsons was way better. They need to spice up this place."}
{"text":"We are a regular customer Tonight we had awful service by a rushed server named Steven and waited forever for our check Our feast looked like old food thrown on a plate The food was old (chops) and dry
We attempted to speak with mgr Chris and he never came over so we left
Lucilles you have really lost your touch We are very disappointed"}
{"text":"Just moved to town and needed a quick meal for the family on our first night. This place was just down the road and man was it good. Quality, taste, and cost were right on point. Giving only 4 stars because I've had better BBQ before. Still a solid choice."}
{"text":"The food here is always great- never a disappointment! I really need to start coming here when I have more of an appetite- the portions are a good size and definitely shareable! I highly recommend the Barbeque Chicken Salad- Smoked and grilled chicken breast tossed in our BBQ ranch dressing with fresh greens, diced tomatoes, grilled sweet corn, cucumbers, black beans, cheddar cheese and topped with spicy onion straws."}
{"text":"This tends to be a fall back for me with BBQ. I keep trying other places, and come back here afterwards.  I've been here at least 10 times and the service has always been great. The food is very consistent, and is delicious!! The BBQ always tender, and everything else fresh.  The decor also kind of cute. The meal is finished with some hot (really, be careful) towels. No wet naps here.  It may be a little more than you wanted to spend on a lunch hour from work, but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour at the bar because I was excited about the good prices. 

It's seat yourself. We were approached after about 10 minutes and our orders were taken. That was the only time we ever saw our server. We didn't even get the biscuits and butter with the meal, so we had to ask another lady who was just bussing tables around us. No one checked up on us for the duration of the meal. I've been to Lucille's many times before and this was the first time I've experienced this kind of service. And the first time at the bar so maybe we'll skip out on that next time. Don't get me wrong, the food is good -- mac and cheese (cheesy and flavorful), brisket is tender, gumbo is rich (kind of salty), biscuits and butter are to die for, but the service this time just really blew it for us. 

Ps, get the strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"This place is very much a chain.  Corny decor, unimaginative menu, bland food, servers devoid of personality.  Still, the booths in the bar are comfy and so we had a good time dining here with friends a month or so ago and watching a playoff game.

They try very hard not to be nailed down to a particular style of barbeque.  Of course this means that they don't do anything particularly well but it also means that you could take a big group of people here from all different parts of the country and they would each be able to find something they wanted to eat on the menu (isn't that the reason for having chain restaurants in the first place?).  A lot of the dishes were served dry and then you could add your own sauce - they had 3 different bottles on the table.  And this is one of the few places we have found in Phoenix that serves Texas style beef ribs so that is a big plus.  We also tried the fried green tomatoes and the okra for appetizers.  Neither was very good (seriously, stay away from the tomatoes) but I haven't had either of them since we lived in the south so even a lousy version of the dish is better than nothing.  What was really amusing is how the server obviously had never had good BBQ in her life; you could really tell by the way she described the dishes.  Anyone who can't answer how long something was smoked and whether it was seasoned with a dry rub or a mop does not deserve to be working at a BBQ joint; even if they are only 16, that is no excuse.  Oh wait, this isn't a BBQ pit, it's a chain imitation.  Sorry, I forgot for a minute.

Overall, the food and service probably should have been one or two stars if I compare it to other barbeque restaurants I have eaten at nationally but compared to what I have had in Phoenix it is a solid three, sadly.  Another thing that gave them an a-ok was the fact that they had a really good selection of beers on tap and even offered Micheladas.  I never thought that drink would go with BBQ but it was a pretty good pairing with the spicy Texas-style sauce they offered.  Too bad they couldn't even do this right; though they did have some Mexican beers on tap the ratio was off (it was like half mixer at least) and they charged $7.50 a pop for them.  I also thought it was cute how the waitress mispronounced the name of the drink and then corrected me when I pronounced it right.  Just priceless."}
{"text":"This was our second try at Lucilles, when you walk in you will really want to like this place as it smells so good. Unfortunately, that's as good as it gets. We arrived about 5:30 and asked not to be sat near any kids (it is always full of families). Of course they sat us right next to a large party with 3 babies in high chairs.

After waiting a while longer we arrived at a table. The waitress took our drink order and asked if we wanted biscuits which of course we said yes to (the best thing about is place). About 5 minutes later she came by and asked if we wanted biscuits again. We told her she already asked us and we said yes. After our drinks came we ordered the original pulled pork sandwich with bbq beans and the brisket sandwich. 

We waited, and waited. No food and no waitress. A Manager happened to walk by and asked if everything was ok. We said we were waiting quite a while for our food and she said she would check on it. Finally our waitress came back and said she ordered the wrong brisket sandwich and it would be out soon. When the food finally arrived my sandwich was bordering cold. The bbq beans were the worst I have ever had. It was more like a soup with a few beans thrown in. The pulled pork was very dry as was the brisket. Both times here the meats have been way over cooked and dry. The Mac and cheese that came with the brisket sandwich was also very plain. A really disappointing experience, again. 

When we got the bill nothing was offered to be taken off for the long wait or cold food. Not that we will be going back again, but I might have given 2 stars if they did."}
{"text":"Awesome \"comfort\" food place! Kenneth is a very good server and took care of us! Great experience as usual! The blackened catfish was amazing but the fried green tomatoes are almost as good as I remembered them from the first time I had them in New Orleans! 
Did I mention the peach cobbler!?! Yum!
PS, on 12/26 I came back to the restaurant again, and again ordered a blackened catfish.I asked for cocktail sauce and was told they didn't have any. When I asked if they could make it, the server was kind enough to ask a manager who not only did she make it but also delivered it. Kudos to Sara the manager for her great customer service skills!"}
{"text":"Over hyped BBQ Forsure. This place Is Forsure without s doubt an average BBQ joint. Being located in Red Rock Casino you'd think it would've fall alongside the line of other places to eat inside the casino ate all pretty good. Only reason why I'm giving 3 stars is cuz the service was very great . Friendly staff and warming attitudes. Just a bummer of small portions and not too special of sauces they used on the ribs and all. Maybe yard house next time will do !"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was sooooo yummy, I got the chicken pasta which was unbelievably creamy, my boyfriend got the tri tip sandwich which was huge! Biscuits with apple butter was so damn good I almost wanted to just eat those for dinner. Mackenzie was our waitress and she was very attentive, polite and funny. Overall awesome experience."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Lucille's.  The first time my pulled pork sandwich had a big hunk of fat in it, so returned it, so they could remake it.  Waited for it for a long while and finally inquired about it.  Turns out our server thought I said I didn't want another sandwich.  We couldn't figure out how that could possibly have been misunderstood.  Well, by the time I got another sandwich my Mom had finished her meal.  No compensation for the inconvenience either.  The second time I was there with a group of friends, not my choice.  I had the chicken sandwich which was mostly lettuce, soggy onion straws, and an almost non-existent piece of chicken.  Not a good meal for the price.  Third visit was this week, and again, with a group of friends, they like Lucille's.  I had pulled bbq chicken on a baked potato.  The driest baked potato ever, and the chicken was also dry and hardly any sauce on it.  Then I bit into a chicken bone !  I should have said something to the server, and if it had been just me and my husband I would have, but I didn't want to disrupt our group lunch and we were also celebrating a Bday.  That was the last straw for me, and I'll never be back again.  When you start finding bones in your meal, it's just not worth it !"}
{"text":"This place is inside the Red Rock casino and it's quite roomy.  We walked quite a ways to get to our table. I ordered the three meat combo and most of my meat was a bit dry. I did try the gumbo and that was quite tasty. I also ordered the smokehouse margarita and the drink was a bit savory and good. They offer 3 different types of sauces on the table and most are in the mild side.  If you have a players card they offer buy one get one free meals."}
{"text":"Worst service and some of the worst good I've had. Idk what their standard is, but I suppose if this is it, then I'm not impressed. The ribs were so dry, we needed extra sauce to drown it out. The drinks were extremely sweet with practically not trace of alcohol. The gumbo was alright. The Irish nachos needed something to moisten or flavor them otherwise were bland. The waiter took our food menus away after taking our drink orders, forgot the silverware and got some of the order wrong. He even tried to reason out why it was a bad day. I'm in the service industry myself and it's simple and plain; if you're having a bad day, the customer doesn't care. No excuses. It sounds like all I'm doing is complaining but I'm really trying to be understanding and optimistic, but sad to say I won't return."}
{"text":"Changing this review to simply a food review since the staff and management did ultimately reach out to make amends.  Food is fantastic and the vibe is great. We just had a bad night there."}
{"text":"Happy hour at the bar only. I already think I should be at Yard House. But wait, there's more...no baked potato and no corn on the cob. Guys, it's a barbecue place, you gotta do better than that. The beer came about 30 seconds before the food which does not mean he beer took a long time, it means the food came out in less than five minutes. Do I look like a bum you have to rush out? At least the food was good, the brisket with beans (not corn or baked potato) and greens. Still not a fan of these guys there a lot of better barbecue places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Generally I love Lucille's,we've come here on many family occasions. It's also kinda hard to find places that serve beef ribs instead of pork. Stopped in for lunch since it had been a while and the service and food were really lacking. Our waitress was monotone when talking to us, she asked us if we had been there before and said \"welcome back\" so depressing. When we had questions about the menu answers were short and the service, especially when most people are in a hurry at lunch time, it was really slow here so it prevented us from wanting to get items we would have normally ordered or wanted to. I just ended up getting the spinach dip and it was swimming in oil. Tried pouring some out but it kept accumulating, I could t even finish it and my fingers felt so greasy after every chip. Love their apple butter, sweet tea, and beef ribs and generally having dinner here goes well, service has always been pretty slow since I first came here, still is, but lunch the other day they were not at their best all the way around, more disappointed in the food quality than anything."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Lucille's for a pretty long time. I would say the last time was 4-5 years ago when I lived in California and when it was actually really good. The husband and I were at Red Rock and we decided to eat here, since we ate at Yard House not too long ago at The Linq. We were seated right away on a Sunday afternoon, but service was a bit slow. Our waitress was friendly and always had a smile on her face, but it seemed like she disappeared for a long time while we were waiting. She also forgot about the beer that my husband ordered, so we had to remind her when she brought out our food.

I ordered the pulled pork sliders, and geez, they were horrible! The sweet rolls were very soggy from the beginning. I decided to push those off to the side and just eat the pork by itself. But then the pork was waaayy to salty. It was like they went overboard with the sauce, then decided to dump even more salt over it! Even the sweet potato fries were very salty and over cooked. I can't remember what it was called, but my husband ordered some kind of meat combo and said it tasted fine. So I'm not sure if I just happened to come in on a day that the pulled pork was pure crap? 

The only highlight of this place was the sweet tea and the Totsie Roll Pops, so 2 stars for that! After we finished eating, there were flies flying around our food. I understand that the restaurant has no control over that, since they can come in whenever someone opens the doors, but it's still annoying. At least they weren't around while we were eating.

Well, I gave Lucille's another chance, but won't be back! There are definitely better bbq places here in Vegas! It's sad how this chain has gone sooo downhill."}
{"text":"One of the best southern food places I have been to in the western states. Much better BBQ than the Famous place. The families favorite restaurant since moving to Henderson."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The service is always excellent and the food is delicious and the portions are huge. I've been coming here for years and will continue to tell people how great it is."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Lots of tables.  Bbq smell is inviting.  Friendly service.  Large portions. Full belly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great biscuits to start, drinks in mason jars, staff is friendly, and the food is good!"}
{"text":"SO disappointed.

My husband and I went last night with our infant daughter (asleep in her carrier) and here is a rundown of how it went:

We were promptly greeted and asked by the hostess if we needed a carrier sling.  I declined and said I'd just tuck her carrier under the table by my leg.  The hostess then had a sub-hostess (?) come over and take us to our table.  She also asked if we needed a sling.  Again, I declined.  Minor annoyance.  

What wasn't minor what that she took us over and seated us with 80% of the other patrons in the mostly empty place!!  We were almost all grouped into the same corner of the restaurant.  Nobody wants to go out to dinner and listen to all the conversations of everyone around them when there is room all over the restaurant.  Spread out your diners; give people some elbow room and privacy!

So then our waitress comes up and takes our drink order and that's when I saw that they are asking almost $5 for a mason jar full of strawberry lemonade.  I almost laughed out loud.  Seriously, who the hell thinks that $5 is a fair price for a mason jar of strawberry lemonade? 

*raises eyebrow*  Uh huh, that's what I thought too.  Absurd!

So I ordered the 'bargain' $4 plain old lemonade.  (I'm definitely not a cheap ass, but I'm also not an idiot.)

The lemonade price actually made me think of the $5 milkshake scene from Pulp Fiction.  And if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about then stop reading this review right NOW and go rent get Pulp Fiction on streaming Netflix.    

I'll wait for you to come back...

*drumming fingers*

Okay, done watching the movie?  That scene was good, right?  Okay, back to the review...

Anyway, the drinks were prompt and I'll just say it, \"That's a pretty fucking good lemonade. I don't know if it's worth five dollars but it's pretty fucking good.\"

So the waitress then asks if if we'd like an appetizer so we order a $4 'half order' (the full order was $7) of fried green tomatoes which, by the way, is also an OUTSTANDING movie.   What???  You've never seen that either??  *gasp*


Go on, I'll wait.  Again.

*taps foot*

Back?  Outstanding film!!  Amiright?

Back to the review.  Again.  

The half order of fried green tomatoes was a complete fucking joke.  There were TWO (yes, I said 2) fried green tomatoes.  Not only was I flabbergasted at the utter lack of value for the $4 I just paid for that tiny plate with 2 pitiful tomato slices but they were impossibly hot, mushy, and utterly tasteless.  Even the shitty red pepper sauce they were swimming in was completely bland.  Unbelievable.  Should I even bother adding that it was delivered to our table by a different server who walked by us with two plates, looked confused, turned around muttered something under her breath that sounded like \"they ordered the wrong tomatoes\", put it down and walked away with the other plate; still looking utterly lost.

So when we ordered the 'World's Biggest Rip Off Of for an Appetizer', we also placed or dinner orders.  I asked for the BBQ Shrimp dinner ($20) and I substituted mashed potatoes for the cheesy grits (sounds yuck) and I decided to stick with the greens that it comes with originally.  My husband ordered the beef ribs and corn on the cob, I have no idea what that cost, but our final bill was almost $60, you sort that shit out because 'I can't math' very good.

Our food came right away which was good.  What was VERY bad was that my plate was utterly covered in some parsley and dry rub garnish that had been liberally sprinkled around (and over) the whole plate by someone I'm assuming must've had a grand mal seizure right as they were holding a handful of this stuff.  My food and plate was COVERED in this crap.  I scraped it off as best I could and easily came up with 1/4 of a cup of this sprinkled garbage all over everything.  It was awful.

Adding to that the greens were horrendous.  Bitter, cold and tasteless. 
The shrimp were drowning in this ghastly BBQ sauce that was an unappetizing blend of too spicy and not quite BBQ'y sauce.  I can't put my finger on it, but I didn't care for it one bit.  So I sat there and choked down my $20 worth of shrimp and picked at my mashed red potatoes, which were the only thing decent on my plate.  I even complained to my waitress that my plate was covered in this nasty crap and had ruined my food all she could do was look at me and say \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"

Really that's it?  No offer to get the manager, or replace my food, anything?

Worthless.

In comparison the husband's food looked pretty good, as I looked on mournfully at his plate and looked back in disgust at mine.

I wanted to like this place, I really, really did.  The decor is fabulous and the place is uber cute, but the bizarre seating patterns, the ridiculous pricing for things like lemonade and 2 inedible FUCKING tomatoes, and the overzealous garnishments of inedible, chopped parsley and dry rub were too just much."}

Ordered one of their platters (forget the name) but it was a special and not on the regular menu...

Biscuits and butter -- Very good some of the best anywhere
Onion strings -- Again, very good
St Louis ribs -- over done odd flavor (almost a lighter fluid taste)
Baby back ribs -- over done odd flavor
Rib chop -- odd flavor
Potato salad -- ok
Greens -- not sure why but tasted fishy.  Asked for pepper vinger (Trappey's comes to mind).  They had no idea what I was talking about.

No drinks other than water...$70 with tip.  Sorry to say, but not worth it."}
{"text":"GREAT EXPERIENCE! Tiffany, our server, was attentive and wonderful especially for a party of 8. The team working environment was great to experience! Great food. Great service. And they brought us warm towels for our sticky fingers!"}
{"text":"Best ribs in town. The atmosphere was an experience worth taking friends, family or dates to. I'll will be back for sure again and again."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite restaurant for smoked meat - no matter if it was 2 of us or 10 of us. The last THREE TIMES (we purchased coupons that were non-refundable) were terrible experiences.  Brisket ends were fatty and greasy, hamburger was a dried out hockey puck, onion straws were over-cooked, pulled pork was a major disappointment. We have been to this restaurant so many times and recommended it highly. Something has happened to take away from the quality. Prices have also been increased."}
{"text":"Just to let you know, the following events happened about 3 years ago.  This was our first time visiting this particular Lucille's.  My wife and I had been to the branch in Rancho Cucamonga before.  Unfortunately, this branch was not nearly as good as the one we visited before.  We arrived with our friends at a little past 9pm on a Thursday night.

We had taken a day trip to Grand Canyon West, and our friends were craving some good bbq.  I remembered that there was a Lucille's in Henderson so I recommended this place cause of the good food we had tasted at their Rancho Cucamonga location.  We arrived here tired and very hungry.  

The place was still busy when we arrived, but they were able to seat us right away.  We were served our food right away (about 5 minutes after they took our order).  So were were very happy about that considering we were starving.  Unfortunately, the food did not taste fresh at all.  The babyback ribs were tough and tasteless.  The bbq tri tip was also tough and chewy.  Sides and bread were fine though.

Looking back, we should have complained.  We were so hungry though so we didn't want to wait for anything else.  Anyways, we left unsatisfied although not hungry anymore.

I'd still go back to Lucille's.  Just not this location (at least not go there close to closing time)."}
{"text":"Stopped in to take advantage of happy hour.  We were seated in a booth - not given a choice - happy hour menu was ON our table but told we could not order happy hour because we were not in the bar ?!?  So we asked to be moved to the bar and ordered happy hour appetizers. 
Guys - don't put a menu on my table if I can't order from it.

Once we got reseated in the bar area where we could enjoy the happy hour discount we thoroughly enjoyed the food and drinks.   
Deducting ONE star for the large happy hour special.  Started off poorly but made up with the BBQ."}
{"text":"Before Lucille's BBQ came to AZ we use to frequent this restaurant in CA.

Decor in Southern Style and always great prompt service.  They start you off with biscuits and an apple butter, but ask for the honey to eat with the biscuits. 

There is such a large selection of ribs, the beef ribs are huge,  baby back are always good but I prefer the St Louis Ribs because of the size and how juicy and tendor that they are always served. You also choose 2 sides which all are good. My favorite are corn bread,  mac and cheese,  corn on the cob and baked potato. 

If you order a drink it comes in a mason jar with unlimited refills.

The restaurant looks like you are in the South and I love the leg lamp by the restroom like in \"A Christmas Story\".

What ever you order you can't go wrong everything is always excellent. 

Will be back when I get the bbq fever. Goo d job Lucille's!"}
{"text":"Delicious BBQ, but a bit overpriced in my opinion. 2 meat BBQ was 29.99. However, the hot towels to wipe hands at the end of the meal was quite the unexpected touch that made me appreciate this place a bit more. I recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"I want to like/love this place & it smells oh so good, but I just can't. The food itself is pretty good but costs too much money. I've been here half a dozen times (only once on my choice), and the food is yummy. But I've been trying to justify the prices and can't. I eat a lot of BBQ and this is the most expensive I have ever had. The last two times I've been on the patio with a group of 6-10 each time. The place has NOT been packed and it's been week nights, and you know what? The waiter acts like we don't matter. He acted (two different one) like we've put him out when we wanted more drinks. He would drop something off and run off before checking if we need anything else. The last time we were there was this past Tuesday evening. It was just terrible. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"This is a special treat place for my BF and I (due to it being not too healthy) but man is it good and smothered in whatever sauce you like. Different types of BBQ sauce line each table. My favorite is the biscuits that come with every order, they are the best around!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to have a bite to eat before heading back to Cali... some friends here reccomended, Lucille does not dissapoint!  Everything is smoked in the morning and served hot and fresh!  BBQ sauce deserves a blue ribbon... thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Was told by several people this place is great and I should try it out.  Finally had the need for some great BBQ food.  I was more than delighted by the service, food, and drinks.  Start with service.  One of the number one reasons I will return to a restaurant.   My server was on it and made sure my muddy water (ice tea with lemonade) was always full.  She was just great.   Food.  I had a lunch platter with baby back ribs, pulled pork, and 1/4 of a chicken.  The flavors where exactly like they should be from a smokehouse.  Absolutely loved the food.  The biscuits were great with apple butter.  The Fried pickles were great.  Breading fell off mostly but still enjoyed them.  The drink.  Muddy water is 1/2 ice tea and 1/2 lemonade.   Could not get enough. I believe I sloshed out of the place from all of the ice tea I drank.  Price was way reasonable and I left a big tip to boot.  I would highly suggest this place for BBQ food in Las Vegas.   Especially since San Jose Smoking Pig was such a disappointment claiming to be a smokehouse."}
{"text":"Lucille's is yet an other example allong the lines of Aunt Chillada's or Red Devil;  that at one time was great but has not been able to keep up with the influx of better restaurants.

There is nothing particularly wrong with any aspect of what we're experiencing except that with every bite we we're asking our selves why are we paying this much for this?

It is sad to say but Lucille's is no better than Famous Dave's so if that is your level of BBQ appreciation, enjoy. If Lucille's survives another few years maybe we'll pop in and give them an other chance."}
{"text":"Will never go back there..ordered the pulled pork queso dip..right when they dropped it off..u can smell the old grease that tortilla chips were fried it..so I sent them back..my niece ordered the ribs which were decent I had the Cajun fried chicken strips..which were not crispy and again u can tell the oil hadn't been changed out..u can taste it..the manager came over and I explained to her she was very apologetic and took them off the bill which she have..our service was friendly enough but not attentive..it wasn't busy..slow slow service ..this place has become like a tgifs..quality is horrible now.."}
{"text":"This restaurant always has a great vibe, especially on a beautiful sunny day when you want to sit outside on the patio. They offer beautiful patio seating, as well as indoor seating. I have come here a few times and each time Ive had a great experience. The servers here are always pleasant & helpful. 
The most recent visit I had here I came with my mom & she ordered the sausage trio, along with side of corn, coleslaw and cornbread. I had the chicken pasta with mushrooms and peppers. We both had watermelon teas to drink & everything was so good! The portions are very big, even enough to share. (Depending on your company's appetite) I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants yummy southern food made fresh!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue, great service, not so great wait.

But what do you expect when you come with a big party and the place is packed?

I took a while to get someplace to sit but once we did they were able to put us all together in one table and that in itself was good accommodations.

We ordered the Super Feast.  The Feast or the Super Feast is the way to go to avoid little nuances of choosiness and makes it more of a family style meal.  The foodserver was top notch and although they included 18% since I had a large party, we added a little more to make sure he received 20%.  

We have also used Lucille's for catering parties.  They have this service down pat and when you need to feed a lot of folks with food that makes them lick their fingers, this is where you want to call."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is outstanding. The service is always great also. One of the good locations to go to."}
