{"text":"I am just back from my third FUSION CEO-CIO Symposium at Fluno. Unfortunately you can't get in there unless you are attending a conference. The food, service and rooms are so good it is worth finding a conference you can register for just for the experience. Everyone raved about the food, and today when the conference overflowed the first floor seating, the staff moved a few of us upstairs, brought cutlery and drinks, came by a few minutes later with a tray of their excellent desserts which generally overwhelmed the will power of most attendees. Also excellent wines in the pub at the dinner in the evening.

Wireless everywhere and the auditorium has all the latest tech for speakers and wireless and electrical outlets on the desk extending around the room. This is the best conference facility -- auditorium, hotel rooms and food -- that I have experienced.

8th floor has a \"study pub\" open from 4 to 11 with a bar and pool table and, I saw on the wall plaque, an exercise facility. The restaurant area seats about 75, I think -- great food, great service and great wines."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Fluno Center for 6 nights.  Although there have been a few upgrades since my last stay two years ago (furniture, bathroom) it was still a disappointment.  The worst issue was the room felt damp: damp air, damp carpet, damp bedding.  And after 6 days, damp clothes...as if we'd gone camping.  I couldn't wait to check out and would prefer not to stay at the Fluno again until whatever systemic HVAC problems (or whatever is causing this) are resolved."}
{"text":"This is the hotel and business center for UW-Madison. If you get put up here, you're in luck! The place is super clean and modern with big rooms and quality bedding, and the staffers are attentive and always respond quickly to problems. The dining room is superb, too, and I have two great filet mignon memories here. (Not sure if you can access it without being part of a Fluno event or staying there, but I don't see why they'd not want your business, so give it a shot.)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. I have stayed in many hotels and taken training many times in hotels but this is the best. Comfortable room, jacuzzi tub, nice location, super nice staff, and the food is fantastic. I'm hoping to come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic hotel located in the heart of the city. The feel of it is very unique. It's part hotel/part business school/part conference center so don't expect all the amenities of a typical hotel. However with all there is to do around the area you likely won't be spending much time inside anyways. There is a restaurant on the bottom floor which has a decent breakfast spread and a bar/lounge area on the top floor. 

The rooms themselves are very clean and comfortable. The staff is incredibly helpful at making recommendations on places to eat and things to do in the area. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a reliable hotel in a great location.

Bonus star for being across the street from Ian's Pizza!"}
{"text":"If location to the campus and the major venues of UW is your priority, then this cannot be beat. It has just about everything that a commercial chain hotel would have with dining options, fitness room, front desk, etc.  The only thing that you might want to be aware of is that you probably have a 50% chance of getting a room with a view of a parking facility and outdoor HVAC equipment.  We did not know that, and so when the receptionist said I'm putting you in the back because it's probably going to be a noisy weekend on the other side, we just believed him.  But, honestly, the rooms with a view are in demand and you'll have to ask for it beforehand rather than be defaulted to the rear."}
{"text":"A university conference center offering hotel rooms on the side.

Note: I'm evaluating this as a hotel. As a home away from home conference center, the rating would be a bit stronger.

As far as hotels go this place has a number of strengths:

- decent sized rooms and bathrooms
- attached, underground parking ($12/day)
- classic, arts and craft decor
- nice looking lobby
- location- right on the SE edge of campus
- nice but small pub on top floor (opens at 4:30)

Opportunities
-pillows are pretty hard
-only queen beds -either one bed or two per room
-rooms feel a little Spartan- sort of a nicer bigger dorm room
- shower heads are extra low flow (felt like it took 10 min just to get wet)

We stayed one night in January on a non-sports weekend (school hadn't resumed yet for the semester) so we had the place mostly to ourselves and there were plenty of spaces in the attached parking garage.  Checkin process was quick and easy and the student inn keepers were friendly and helpful. As hotels go, this place is on par with a 3-star hotel. If you want something a bit more plus, around the same price with a few more amenities, try the new Hampton Inn a block away (I've stayed there a couple of times).

Overall the Fluono center is nice but not my first choice for a campus hotel."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Fluno Center this past weekend for graduation. The location was fantastic and the room accommodations were nice. The service was terrible. The front desk clerk, Estefania, was not helpful, was unenthusiastic and honestly seemed as if she could care less about our stay. We had a party of approx. 12 people (family) and after graduation we went to the 8th Floor Study Pub. The guys working the bar (Colin and a few others) were not friendly and several people in our party commented about how rude they were. It truly was unbelievable. We were ordering food and drinks and we had to hunt them down for things, ask multiple times for things and the bar was not busy at all. They were arrogant and rude!

Then about midnight, there was so much noise/music coming from the bar across the street it was unbelievable. This went on for about 2 1/2 hours. During that time, it was impossible to get any sleep. When I mentioned it to Estefania the next morning she said it's graduation and that happens and I should have asked for a room on the other side. Her lack of service was par for the course. It was my first time staying there (how would I have known to ask for the other side?) and it will honestly be my last. 

I was unimpressed with the service. It's more difficult to be rude than nice. These students working the front desk and study pub have A LOT to learn regarding service and friendliness. It's so unfortunate because the rest of the weekend was fabulous! Hopefully the management at the Fluno Center can train their staff to meet the price tag of the stay."}
{"text":"I recently attended a UW conference and many of our lectures were held at the Fluno center. I was very impressed by the quality of the large lecture hall- each seat provided lots of desktop space, two plugs and an unobstructed view of the the projector and speaker. Sound traveled well and AV system worked well. Snacks in the morning and afternoon were high quality- some healthy options and some more sugary options. Coffee, tea, hot water, and cold water with all of the expected fixins were provided throughout the day. We had lunch in the attached restaurant/pub and were all very impressed by the quality of food- expected to be college dorm-cafe-like but actually felt like a decent restaurant with a great variety of options. I can see why our group chooses to return to the same place year after year."}
{"text":"Great place to stay when coming to to University or for a conference. It is great to be in the heart of campus and so close
to everything. 

If you stay multiple times you will recognize staff from year to year, and you know they know what they are doing! Since it isn't a hotel there are always a few things I see as a traveler. It takes a bit longer to check in, there are no plastic laundry bags in the rooms, and the bar/room service hours are shorter than conventional hotels. That is pretty quick to excuse for a great place to stay that is convenient to meetings."}
