{"text":"Horrible service. Completely disorganized and understaffed. My friend and I ended up ordering for take out instead. 

We ordered the green curry, mine with tofu and a spice level of 6, and his with chicken at a spice level of 0. The curry was watery without much flavor, but with a good spice kick. Weirdly, my order did not have green beans whereas my friend's did. His \" spicy level 0\" curry had visible spices floating in it and had a slight kick... not sure if this is a miscommunication issue or if they have a baseline spicyness.

Overall, I would not recommend this place. Maybe we went at an especially busy time (Sunday 730pm on labor day weekend), but I plan on going to Pusadee in the future."}
{"text":"To preface this: I think smiling banana leaf has some of the best thai food in pittsburgh.

Why did I give it 3 stars?  Their main waitress is absolutely awful. She is rude and ruins the experience nearly every time. 

I have friends that refuse to go to smiling banana leaf with me because of how rude the waitress is."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf was a highlight of living in Highland Park for a few months when we first moved to Pittsburgh.  We go pretty regularly, almost always at off hours.  We've been told at dinner that there would be a rather long wait, but they always offer to call your cell phone if you want to go to the coffee shop around the corner or walk around.  
The spring rolls are nothing to write home about, but the entrees are fantastic.  Their tofu is really good."}
{"text":"Totally satisfied my food needs this evening. I wanted something light, so I ordered tofu fresh rolls and vegetable tom kha soup, level 5. I enjoy a medium level of spice and the soup gave me just the hint of heat I wanted. I would consider going 6 with his soup in the future, but not more. 

Cute interior, reasonable prices and friendly staff. The service was quick, but I expected that as I was the only one dining in at that time. Many people came to pick up orders as I dined. 

I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love,Love,Love The Smiling Banana.   Best  Thai food  in Pittsburgh!!!
It is a small little gem tucked away in Highland Park.   It is well worth the drive!
I would recommend the resturant to anyone looking for great Thai Food and friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh. BYOB with no additional charge. Only downside is limited seating, so it can feel a little crowded, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Really tiny place, very pleasant service. However sidewalk seating looked questionaby uncomfortable.

Stopped in for take-out. Ordered the shrimp fresh spring rolls and green curry with chicken. Food was wonderful. Fresh spring rolls were fresh and spot on - basil was very fragrant. 

Green curry ordered a 6 hot which I think was good and manageable. The rice was warm and perfectly sticky, eggplant in the curry was buttery and flavorful. Chicken was spot on not dry, not meager- green beans were a bit tough and it would have been nice to have had some pods in there, but overall the curry was very delicious. Price point was good as well - got me out to Highland Park which I never venture to - Bryant St. has promise. Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Cute, small place. Everything there is really delicious. Love their green curry and garlic entree. The service does get a bit slow, I feel like it's gotten a little worse lately. They could probably stand to hire another server."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves the best thai food i have ever had.. Although they recently raised their prices and its more costly specially on weekends, but still the quality of food is just awesome."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, back when it had it had about half the seating that it does now. The food has always been consistently good here, especially the soups and curries.

I really wanted a noodle dish, but I love the curries, so I ordered the green curry noodle soup with vegetables. YUM! They use eggplant in that one, which is smokey and juicy and was the envy of the table. I can't speak for the lunch sizes, but the dinner portions are plenty. My girlfriend and I used to split a single curry all the time, but I doubt many others would agree with me on that one!

I love the tom yum and tom kha soups. I am vegetarian and was told in the past I could get vegetarian tom yum... but apparently ALL soup bases are currently made with chicken broth - or at least this is what our server told us on our last visit in January 2015.

Regarding spice levels... I'd say the soups are all spicy, so order low spice levels if you please. The tom yum is always very hot. Noodle dishes (pad see ew, etc) can be ordered at a spice level 0, if you'd prefer. The curries are obviously spicy, but very closely match the expected levels, so order spice levels moderately and you shouldn't be disappointed (or surprised!)"}
{"text":"BEST Thai in town! Parking may be an issue but it's a favorite place of mine and my family!"}
{"text":"I had the pumpkin curry.  Delicious!  I finished the entire dish in one sitting, which only happens if I really love it.  I don't remember the service being either bad or great, so overall, no complaints.  The price was not as cheap as, say, Thai food in Austin, but it's on par with other places (Boulder, SF).  Also, the pillows are pretty awesome.  Looking forward to trying more dishes -- everything on the menu sounded good."}
{"text":"Consistently good thai. Nothing phenomenal, but the kind of thai you want to curl up with on a cold day. The kind of thai that's always there - ready to listen - when you need it. The kind of thai you can trust to be pretty good. Warm, attentive service."}
{"text":"Some awesome Thai food! We ordered takeout but we are definitely going back for formal dinner. We ordered vegetarian pineapple fried rice and pad Thai and trust me, it did not disappoint. Tasted good the next day as left over.
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice environment. Very friendly service. But kind of slow considering how busy they are. Tom yon soup is quite Americanized. Spicy fried rice is very good."}
{"text":"Dont be fooled by this tiny hole in the wall! The beef glass noodles are a favorite but just about everything served here us absolutely delicious!  Also try their thai iced cofee, super addictive."}
{"text":"Such a good find! Tiny little place with the most amazing pumpkin curry. The Thai samosas were delicious and everything everyone around us had looked equally delicious. Oh and try the brown rice-it was like no other brown rice I had ever had and it was divine!"}
{"text":"I don't get all the hype. Food was just ok."}
{"text":"I have become completely obsessed with this place! It's adorable inside, the service is great, and the food is MIND-BLOWING. Seriously, I have yet to try a single thing here that I didn't completely LOVE. 

The pineapple curry is wonderful, as is the basils, pad thai, and get the samosas! The cucumber sauce served with them is soooo good! I normally get about a 7 for spicyness and it's very hot but bearable! Perfect, perfect food! Best Thai food I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"Last weekend, my boyfriend and I set out to satisfy our craving for Thai food.  After driving out to Pusadee's Garden and discovering it was closed, we did a quick Yelp search for the next closest place...and ended up at Smiling Banana Leaf.

After a short 15-20 minute wait, we were seated at a table in the tiny dining room.  Not a bad wait, considering we didn't have a reservation.  I ordered tom yum soup and green curry with tofu and couldn't have been happier with my selections.  They will ask you on a scale of 1-10 how spicy you want your food, and they aren't afraid to really add some heat.  The portions are large, the food is flavorful and spicy, and everything came out quickly.  My boyfriend, who ordered the tom kha soup and panang curry, was equally as happy.  We left Smiling Banana Leaf full, happy, and with leftovers that tasted even better the next day.

After our dinner at Smiling Banana Leaf, I craved that green curry all week long.  I even went so far as to attempt to make my own green curry.  And I've never made any sort of curry in my life.  Needless to say, I think I'll leave it to the chefs at Smiling Banana Leaf.

We decided to make our second trip to the restaurant less than a week later.  We rarely eat at the same place twice, especially so soon after our first visit.  But we had to make an exception for this place.  This time, we planned ahead by making reservations and bringing a bottle of wine.  I decided to switch it up and try the tofu eggplant with basil, which was tasty but came out a bit cold.  My boyfriend again went with the panang curry, and enjoyed it just as much the second time.  Next time, I will probably switch back to a curry as well.

Overall, I would highly recommend Smiling Banana Leaf.   The service is always super speedy and friendly, the food is delicious, and the value is great.  Considering how small the dining room is (probably seats about 25 people), I would suggest making a reservation.  It can also get quite loud when the dining room is full.  Keep in mind that the restaurant is also BYOB. I would rate this restaurant a 4.5/5 if I could, but for now I'll give it a 5."}
{"text":"Green curry and pad Thai were phenomenal. Service was sweet and delightful."}
{"text":"This was our first Thai experience. The food was fresh and tastes amazing. My sister ordered the curry noodles with shrimp and the flavor was amazing. My shrimp pad thai was really good. Tasty. The hostess was very nice. We are definitely returning."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. They have levels 1-10 and I went for 3. I will get level 4 or 5 next time. I like spicy food but not to a level where you can't taste anything because it's too hot.
Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The food is decent. The attitude of the owner and the server is really really f********* disgusting. He made a mistake in taking my order and I was told maybe \"you did not tell me correctly\". 20 minutes to get water to the table. Might as well close down the place and sell soda and chips."}
{"text":"Went with a party of five people.  Everyone got something different and really enjoyed their food.  The service was great also."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in Highland Park! The restaurant is a bit cramped, though I haven't eaten there since the remodel. It's well worth it for the food. I've eaten in a couple times as well as getting take-out on multiple occasions. Consistently good Thai food, which cannot be said of a lot of restaurants around Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great waitress.  Nice to sit outdoors. Can be crowded indoors."}
{"text":"My favorite thai food in Pittsburgh.  Inexpensive, large portions, consistent spice ratings.  I highly recommend the fried rice, pad thai, and yellow curry."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I decided to check it out on a snowy Sunday night in January. None of us are familiar with the Highland Park area, and it took us a couple of trips up and down the street before we found the location... and this was with our GPS. Maybe we're just navigationally challenged, or perhaps they need a better awning or sign or giant flashing arrow indicating their location.

We didn't have a reservation but were lucky enough to be seated immediately. It doesn't look like it from the outside, but this place is very tiny, in a could-you-please-shift-your-table-so-I-can-get-into-my-seat-and-not-move-another-inch kind of way. It was moderately crowded when we arrived and only got busier as the night went on, so I would definitely suggest calling ahead for a reservation during dinner. The service was awesome: attentive staff and very efficient in terms of ordering and getting food out of the kitchen.

As I usually do when I check out a new Thai restaurant, I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai at a moderately spicy level. The sauce the noodles were dressed in was very flavorful, but the entree as a whole didn't live up to all the hype and my expectations. The curries and other noodle dishes my friends ordered all looked delicious and they had nothing but good things to say. Thus I'm definitely looking forward to going back and trying something new next time."}
{"text":"i've eaten here a million times because it's a few blocks from my house and the quality keeps going down. I don't like writing negative reviews, but honestly, we are disappointed every single time that we've been in the past two years. the veggies are not fresh, most of them are even canned. The noodles taste like canned mushrooms and rice wine vinegar. Our new place to go is noodlehead. it's fresher, faster and delicious."}
{"text":"Bustling but pleasant atmosphere that has a neighborhood feel, but delicately spiced fare.  Would say it's the best curry of several thai places in Shadyside/Sq Hill.  Moo yang pork is also recommended as excellent appetizer.  If you decide to get take out, walk around and enjoy Highland park's excellent and eclectic architectural styles."}
{"text":"I don't get it, 4.5 stars?  Ordered the garlic chicken, very bland.  Wife had the veggie pad thai which was also bland.  we paid ~25 bucks for 2 entrees and rice which was not cheap for thai in my opinion.  Very underwhelming.  Service was pretty good.  I prefer Thai Gourmet and Thai Cuisine"}
{"text":"Food: The menu has so many \"good-sounding\" entrees that its difficult to choose what to eat.  Its typical Thai cuisine with curries, noodles, soups, or rice/fried rice options.  There are plenty of vegetarian options, as would be expected, and more than enough meat too.  We ordered the fresh spring rolls which were very fresh and tasty.  The Tom Yum comes in a very large bowl, the biggest I've had in Pittsburgh, and was great.  Entrees are ordered on the 1-10 spicy scale and come with your choice of meat or tofu/veggies.  We ordered a curry dish, which was good but a little bland, not as potent or spicy as we anticipated or would have preferred.  We also ordered a spicy bean dish which came with an excellent sauce and the correct amount of spice based on the number we selected.  The servings are large and we had enough to bring home.  We didn't try dessert, but there were 4-5 options.  Overall, the food was far above average, but not incredible.

Price: Smiling Banana Leaf is very modestly priced.  Entrees ranged from $10-12, soups around $3.50 and appetizers for $4-5.  The quality of food and atmosphere are excellent considering the price of a meal here.

Drinks: BYOB. 

Atmosphere: The dining area is very small, and only accommodates about 20 people.  The decor is cozy and there is soothing music, not played too loud, in the background.  The tables are close together, but not so close you feel like you're sitting on top of each other.  Although, it is hard to get to the bathroom without asking someone to move.  It may be wise to make a reservation due to the small size of the dining room.  Despite the room being small, it didn't feel loud or distracting.

Service: The service was great, and our waitress, who appeared to be the owner or manager, was funny, engaging, and seemed genuinely pleased to be serving us.  She had a great attitude and made the dining experience more enjoyable.  Our water could have been replaced a few more times, but our food came very fast (almost too fast) and we didn't have to wait long for our check despite a packed dining room due to Valentine's Day weekend.

(+): cozy dining room, friendly staff, very affordable

(-): tables tightly packed

Would I go back again? Yes. Worth the drive to Highland Park, especially if you're on a budget."}
{"text":"In sum, the food here is mind-blowing and simply to die for...if eaten as a take-out or  to eat in person via a reservation only methinks. I prefer the former, I get a little claustrophobic sitting that close to complete strangers. 

We are fortunate, us Pix'burgers to have a nice selection of Thai restaurants in the area. That being said this is the uncontested winner in my book. The servers are great, friendly, welcoming- it seems everyone enjoys working there. That is an excellent framework for any successful business. The parking can be rough, it is on Bryant Street. Any given weekend can make this messy. Best to use the buddy system. I call ahead for take-out, me husband drives a few laps around if his double parked car becomes an issue... I run in and grab the goods.

I ordered the Moo Yang for our starter. Grilled and mouth-watering, slightly smoky and sweetly marinated pork served on a bed of lovely greens. A nice pile of sticky rice to boot. Did I mention the dipping sauce? Not that the pork needs it, but seriously what is in this spicy plum sauce? I want to ask for extra next time and eat it with a spoon. Then again I am obsessed with dips, sauces and the like. If you are not- you are missing out! Nevertheless, the pork can stand on its own.

Soup. Oh dear. I am quite the sucker for coconut based broths. Let me tell you that the Tom Kha Soup is a pure creamy decadence of nirvana. I cannot say enough good things about this soup in general and especially their preparation of it. They obviously use a decent coconut milk. I honestly can say I can tell the difference. Moreover, the ginger or should I say the galangal the \"kha\" of the soup brings that sweet and zesty twist that complements the coconut milk fondly. A bit of mushroom, a hint of lemongrass, a splash of lime juice, and a dash of red chili paste (methinks) merry well together especially when one chooses to add the shrimp. I think non-shrimp eaters would like that one can add chicken, beef or tofu. But the shrimp, juicy medium sized scrimps! Love it.

I have a confession to make...I am that Thai-food customer...but it is okay- I can admit it...I love Shrimp Pad Thai. I order it every time I eat Thai food. 

I know, I know. I cannot believe I am writing this in a such a public forum. I feel like I need to attend some sort of addiction group. \"Hi, my name is Jordana and I cannot resist ordering the same Thai entree every time we go out for Thai.\" Nothing is more run-of-the-mill than Shrimp Pad Thai. In that essence, I am not a daring food critic of sorts. But- I promise the next time I order a Thai entree I will go outside of my Pad-Thai comfort zone and share all the details with everyone. Nevertheless, their Shrimp Pad Thai is the best in the city! After all-who would know better than I the purported amateur Shrimp Pad Thai eater =)

Enjoy the food, I know you will =)"}
{"text":"Did take out from Smiling Banana and the service was prompt - only took about 15 minutes to have our order ready. The chicken fried rice was amazing and so fresh - not too greasy or overdone with salt; I will definitely order from here or stop in again and recommend others to do the same"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, too much time passes between my visits to Smiling Banana Leaf to recall the details of everything I've ordered before, with the exception of the pumpkin curry, which is phenomenal. However, over the course of half a dozen or so visits, I've never gone wrong with their menu. Their portions are generous (although I've found their pumpkin curry to be particularly huge compared to something like their garlic entrée), their prices reasonable (especially for lunch!), and their staff is very friendly. The last time I dined there, it seemed like only 10 or 15 minutes passed between ordering and having my food delivered to the table (although that was during a pretty dead afternoon).

A word of caution: know your comfort level on the spiciness scale. The servers and kitchen are more than willing to make adjustments to food after it comes out, but I still wish I had a better understanding of their spiciness ranking system. As someone who considers herself somewhat adventurous with spice in average American cuisine (I know, I know--American cuisine spice is incredibly boring, comparatively), I have been shocked after ordering what I thought was middle-of-the-road spiciness. I think I said I wanted a five on a scale of ten once and I ended up combining my curry with all of my rice in an effort to dilute it, and even then I had to work through it slowly.

The restaurant is very small--maybe 10 tables--and does have a faint odor that seems to be related to a plumbing issue (I've noticed it more than once, months apart). Reservations are essential for peak dining times. However, sidewalk seating is available in fair weather, and takeout is a popular option--I've seen pick-up lines overflowing the entrance on several occasions. The BYOB option is great, although I can't recall whether they have a corking fee.

The neighborhood and nearby park--both called Highland Park--is a gorgeous place to take a walk after feeling stuffed from a dinner there. Still, I usually end up taking a second meal's worth of leftovers with me, only to want to relive the experience again by finishing it all as soon as I get home."}
{"text":"Well, I don't know how I feel about this place.

This is what I know: defiantly make a reservation and the food is great.

This place is very cozy, with only a few tables. Although very cute decor, not ideal if you are claustrophobic.

So, the reason I didn't give a higher score is the service. Our server was very friendly, and very nice, and it wasn't until the end that this individual put a sour taste in my mouth. My fiancee and I were having dinner with another couple, and we were basically booted out right after we had paid the bill. I understand the place is small, people are waiting and that the tables need to turn over quickly so that the servers can make money, but we literally sat for 5 minutes after paying the bill and ending our conversation to leave, when our server literally took our beverages away from us and started cleaning our table right in front of us as if we weren't even there anymore. We were literally finishing up our sentences...it was really, really rude and I just can't get over it. 

So after that, I may think twice as far as where I take my business."}
{"text":"I cannot talk about their food because we left the restaurant after waiting 20 mins to get seated. We made a reservation and showed up on time. The waitress didn't bother to ask the name on which a reservation was made  and gave the  last available seat to somebody else who came to restaurant after us. All this while we were standing right there. I checked the list and sure enough their name/time was after ours. Also my living room bigger than this restaurant(no exaggeration), the tables are very close, noisy, ambience is bad. Did I mention that the area where this restaurant is located is shady ?  Never going back here, there are other/better options in PGH."}
{"text":"Best thai food I've had in Pittsburgh, hands down."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the city to visit for anything Thai.  I've gone here an embarrassing amount of times in the past year and a half and usually choose tofu pad thai every time.  I've also had the spring rolls, fried rice, thai ice tea and thai ice coffee, all of which are terrific as well.

Apart from the food, I must say that the gracious service really makes this place.  Practically everyone here is warm, polite and attentive.  Particularly the tall woman who remembers what I order every time and recently spoiled my friends & I to some free after dinner ice cream.

The only tiny flaws are the portions are slightly smaller (though still less expensive) than some other places I've gone to.  I've lucked out and never had to wait for a table inside but I can see that may be a problem in the winter time.  

I do highly recommend it.  One of the many gems of Highland Park."}
{"text":"After all the amazing reviews, I expected the food to be incredible, but I find it to be pretty average. The food is ready quickly when you order takeout. There is limited seating for dining in. I live nearby, so I eat here pretty often. But if you live in a different part of town, there is probably an equally good Thai place near you."}
{"text":"At par with Thai Gourmet and Thai Tamarind as three better than average Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. Its BYOB, which rather ruins the idea of eating out, and inconsistency in seasoning of Pad Thai. Otherwise, authentic pleasant little nook."}
{"text":"Be prepared to leave here feeling full! They give generous amounts of food on your plate for the price. Chicken pad thai is to die for! 
They have outside seating which you can bring your furry friends along if you please. 
The restaurant is byob as well.
If you are in the mood for thai and definitely good thai, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Please do not ever go here - the food is decent but the service will kill you!

Had I reviewed this place 8-10 months ago, it would get 4 stars from me for a very hospitable staff and consistently good food - always reminding me of true Thai hospitality. The food today is perhaps a notch below its old level but not bad.
However, if you ask me why I am giving this place 1 star ( only because I can't give it a zero), here is my answer. 

I have had 4 instances of extremely poor service ( specifically a male staff) - twice on takeouts and twice while dining in. 
Takeouts - I had ordered curry and noodles. The lid on the containers was not even put on correctly and all my food spilled into the plastic carry bags and my car floor. I called in to let them know only to experience this yet another time.

Dining In - I liked their food especially when the place was run by a different manager who has been mentioned in earlier posts. It was my go-to for comfort food. Currently, this place is run by a guy who can't even speak proper English and has absolutely no regard for customer service. He is extremely rude and arrogant.
About 5-6 months ago, my husband and I decided to celebrate a special occasion there. The server ( the same guy mentioned above) brought us water after a 20 minute wait and a couple requests. He did not take our order correctly and also did not bring our appetizers until the entrees came in. The food was ok and no longer as good as it used to be. Also, let me mention that this was a weeknight and there were only 2 other tables occupied along with us.
This week, I decided to give them another chance hoping that things may have settled back to normal only to find the same server. He again did not take our order correctly - I did not get my soup & when we told him about it, he said that it was our fault and we did not even ask for 2 soups. We decided to take out the food and asked him to get the check. At that point, he said that he appreciates us not making a scene and that it was again \"our mistake\" and that we should understand it was a busy day. At that point, I was mad and I asked to speak to the owner/manager especially since this behavior was unacceptable and he said that \" he is the owner\". God forbid if that is actually true, this business is going down the drain pretty soon. 

How can anyone ever go to this place anymore!"}
{"text":"The food I ordered was very tasty. I got pad-see ew  with beef, and pumpkin curry chicken. I tend to prefer my curries a little less watery and more thickened, but it was still a nice flavor. Good portions, fair proportion of meat. I'll warn you- the prices on their website are not accurate. Their prices are actually higher.

The reason I gave it three stars was because I was very disappointed in the service. I made an order at 7pm on a Saturday, and was told it would be a 40 minutes wait. That in itself seemed excessive. So I arrive at 7:40, ask for my food, and she says it will be another 10 minutes. That seemed long for a mis-estimated time. And yet ten minutes later, it was still not ready. I ended up waiting until 8:20 to get my food. People who complained more got their food sooner. I wouldn't have minded if they warned me beforehand about the wait, and given me an accurate time. But an hour and twenty minutes for food is ridiculous, and making me wait in their small entranceway for an additional 40 minutes is also ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place was delightful. I will be returning and I'll update my review appropriately.

I went here for some take out dinner and got some Pad See Yew with Tofu.  It was great and the dark soy sauce was near perfect. I asked for it to be very spicy, but it sort of fell flat, and I'll blame it on my blinding midwestern whiteness. So, if you want Thai-Spicy, make sure to specify that emphatically. 

The place does seem small, so take out if probably preferred. It is ridiculously low priced for the quality of food you get, so jump on this place before it becomes inundated with every hipster in Pittsburgh. 

I think some Penang Tofu will really test their mettle.

***UPDATE**** I tried the penang tofu. It was miserable. The curry was watery, the tofu tasted barely-fried, and the veggies became limp and waterlogged in the spicy mix. The upside here is that after I requested at \"15 out of 10\" they delivered a spice level that didn't disappoint, unlike the rest of Pittsburgh. 

Rating dropped to 3-stars, from 4. Head for their noodles folks."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. Their Tom Kha soup and basic noodle dishes are unparalleled.  It is small though (less than 10 tables) and can get very loud."}
{"text":"We had a great late lunch here today. Excellent food and excellent service as well. The dining room is very small and cosy. The prices were also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I have been missing Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield, as they are closed for renovations. So, I went out on a limb to try Smiling Banana Leaf... If it had been based solely on the spicy fried thai rice, I would have given it 5 stars. But, my husband had good ol' padt thai, and it was cold, no peanut flavor, and he asked for a 9 out of 10 for a real kick, and we had to ADD habanero hot sauce to it!  So, maybe good on some dishes, but the pad thai was bland. Cute small atmosphere. Will give them another chance."}
{"text":"Been to many Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, but this place is easily the best. The Red Curry is out of this world and the Pad Thai was also the best in the city too. Only downside is we were expecting lunch portion prices (we went on a Sunday) but they only do dinner portions on weekends no matter the time of day. They could have been more transparent with that, which is the reason for the 4 star rating. Easily 5 star food though."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for two days and found this on Yelp. I had a cold so I wanted some good old Tom Yum. I found the food at Smiling Banana to be too sweet. I know that sugar is used in Thai sauces but everything was too sweet. We  also ordered the seafood salad and a green curry with chicken. Salad was ok, but much of the seafood was tasteless. The curry was the most successful dish, but chicken was tough. We got everything 5 out of 10 for spice level.  Maybe we should have gone higher in the spice scale.
I liked the space and the service was good. The bathroom had no paper towels to dry your hands on."}
{"text":"Great tasting Thai food.  Good spices and flavors. Nice, intimate restaurant space."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try this place out! Arrived with a friend at 6:30 for dinner on a Tuesday; it was surprisingly busy even though it had been pouring rain earlier. We were given a wait quote of 10m, though one of the girls offered us an outside table soon after and said we could move inside if it started raining again, which was appreciated. It took a while, understandably, for us to be greeted/given water, but our server was sweet and very apologetic about it when she arrived. 

My friend ordered the red curry with tofu, spice level 1 and I ordered the spicy tom yum noodle soup, spice level 1. Thank goodness neither of us ordered appetizers, because these were such generous portion sizes (coming from someone who eats a lot). The lemongrass broth was absolutely delicious and had the perfect amount of spice to it. So soothing to have after a long day at work. My only gripe was that the chicken was a bit dry. My friend greatly enjoyed her dish as well and ended up having to get half of it boxed up. Our server did check on us a couple times (my friend never went thirsty!) and overall provided wonderful service. I can easily see myself becoming a regular here and will be recommending this place to many others!"}
{"text":"Not great for big groups. We tried to get a reservation on a Sunday evening for 10, the restaurant is a bit small to accommodate and they seem to only take reservations for groups of 6 or less. Understandable, but we felt the staff wasn't kind about explaining it.

Shame, we would've liked to try the food."}
{"text":"Best. Thai. Food. Ever. My family and I probably come here one to two times a month. I usually  get the pad thai or some type of curry with, crispy pork rolls and the fresh spring rolls as appetizers. BUUUUUUUTTTT the workers are *sort of* rude. Must be patient when at the restaurant. I leave either a 15% or 20% tip depending on the speed, niceness, and how crowded the restaurant is. Their food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Think twice before choosing this Thai restaurant.  The restaurant is filthy if u call it a restaurant!  And very, very spicy!!!!     Look elsewhere folks.  Diners beware!!!"}
{"text":"I still remembered the first time when I ate here and sat outside. The whole group liked their food. I've been here several times since that. Most dishes are good but nothing really surprises me. It's worth the money though.

They have limited number of seats, so I usually make a reservation or try to come during less busy time. It's a lovely place."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about this place is that they get more business than they can handle sometimes. I've had to call numerous times to place a takeout order, and I know better than to try and get a table without a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night (although I know it's possible, I just don't like waiting). 

Otherwise, I love this restaurant. It's my go-to takeout place since it's so close to home. And the food is pretty good. Mind you, I've had quite a bit of home cooked Thai food, and nothing compares to home cooked food, but Smiling Banana Leaf hits the spot for me.

Try the basil stir fry with tilapia."}
{"text":"Picked up takeout today and was disappointed to find out that the inside decor has changed greatly. No more vibrant colors with pillows on the dining benches. They have been replaced with a darker colors of hardwood floors and wooden tables. It is not the Smiling Banana Leaf that I remember for its beautiful interior. I ordered pad kee mow on a 8/10 spicy scale but found it to not be very spicy at all. The noodles were also clumped together a lot. So unfortunately, it has changed and I'm hoping that other dishes will be better tasting with fresh flavors and spices but time will tell, as I'm a bit leary to come back. Also, they no longer have lunch specials on Saturdays...not sure about the rest of the week."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've found in Pittsburgh so far. Super cozy spot. No beer or wine."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  This is some of the best Thai in Pittsburgh, with a price you can't beat. The space is very small but uniquely decorate with a great relaxed and intimate atmosphere. Great for small groups or a date. Remember to BYOB if you're inclined to drink."}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing! Really cute ambiance, BYOB and good prices, and some of the best Thai food that I've had in Pittsburgh. If you're thinking about it, go to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Five stars for food and two stars for service. The waitress didn't seem to pay attention to our requests. For example, when I asked to see a dessert menu, she handed us our check.

Overall, I recommend it for the scrumptious food but don't expect too much in terms of service."}
{"text":"Best Thai place I've had in Pittsburgh. The service is quick, and the staff is always friendly. There is limited space inside the restaurant, so you'll want to try to plan ahead for busy hours. Love getting food to go!"}
{"text":"Food was EXCELLENT! I had the red curry noodle with children and could not stop eating it. Great prices and friendly staff. Definitely a place you need to visit for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The first time I went here I went alone, which was good, because the few tables in the dining area were all full and there were a few small groups waiting. Luckily, I was able to squeeze into a small, one-person table and avoid the wait.

It was late summer or early fall, I don't really remember, but you could definitely feel autumn in the air. I went here for the sole purpose of getting pumpkin curry. I was greeted with a friendly hello and seated promptly. The food arrived quickly and I loved it. Even though the place was \"packed\", it was still a nice, quite time. The dining area is very small and cozy, so I guess there is no need to be loud if talking within your table like some other restaurants.

After my initial stop, I've called and ordered pick-up food a few times. After seeing how small the place is and how long you may have to wait to get a table, I figured it's just as easy to get some food to go and eat it at home. Even if it is take-out, it is still a very nice portion and very worth it. I think if I ever decide to go back to eat there, I'll call ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"mmmmm.. I love this place!! Any negative reviews are WAY too skeptical because this is the best thai food I've ever had, and I've had alot. DEFINITELY go."}
{"text":"This place is REALLY busy for dinners, so please be prepared for slow service. Absolutely worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"This place is teeny tiny, but nicely decorated, the waitress was friendly and accommodating, and the food was out lickety-split. It was also very reasonably (dare I say cheaply) priced and DELICIOUS!!

I had my faves, the summer rolls and basil chicken--HUGE lunch portion of  the entree!  Friend had the pineapple fried rice, HUGE portion of that, too, and she said it was yummy!  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The Smiling Banana Leaf is such a unique spot in the city.  It is near Lawrenceville and Wilkinsburg, both of which while not great areas, are certainly being worked on.  The Smiling Banana Leaf is the corner of an intersection, but a neighborhood intersection.  The area is very nice and quite, they have outdoor seating.  Because they are BYOB, if you sit outside you must drink in a styrofoam cup.  This only relates to drinking outside.  
Their masamamm curry is great, and so is the chicken satay.  YOU NEED RESERVATIONS HERE.  Even if you want to go on an off hour, make a reservation in advance.
Good Thai food, all Thai staff, and nice decor."}
{"text":"Have to downgrade this restaurant based on three consecutive bad experiences.  The last of which we found chicken in our tofu dish.  Not cool."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had. I'm not eating curry from anywhere else ever again."}
{"text":"The tom kha was fantastic.  Rich, complex, spicy balanced.  The green curry was only pretty good.  It was too watery and using bell peppers in any Asian dish is in my mind a giant mistake.

I will certainly return as this is easily the best Thai food on the city."}
{"text":"I absolutely love smiling banana leaf. The food is fresh and full of flavor. The atmosphere is tranquil yet cheerful. Customer service at sbl is on target and refreshing. If you like/love thai food like I do, you will enjoy eating here."}
{"text":"It was awesome!

This is a place that true foodies will enjoy ( I can't believe I wrote that, but it is true).

- small (tiny) but warm, friendly, and cozy
- food was insanely good (everyone at table agreed)
- really cute area of Highland park"}
{"text":"We tried this place visiting from New York City, where there are plenty of great Thai restaurants.  I would say this place is well above par, even by NY standards: small place on a nice residential block, nice ambience, friendly service and, of course, great food. We had the basil dish and the red curry - both were excellent!  I've seen a couple reviews here saying the curry was a bit liquidy, but that's how it's supposed to be, from my experience.  Tom yum soup was also very good - I've had better but it was still above average. Oh and for dessert, the fried banana with ice cream was outrageous, and the mango with sticky rice was quite good as well.  I'm sure I will be back next time I visit to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Now, I don't live too close to Highland Park, but on the recommendation of you, the Yelpers, I had to try it while I was moving in.

Smiling Banana Leaf is a small Thai place, that, in my opinion, sets itself up perfectly for a good lunchtime experience. We got in later in the afternoon, but we were still alright for the lunch menu. I ordered the Panang Curry and my parents got the pineapple curry and some spring rolls for accompaniment. My curry, as I'd hoped, was creamy and abundant with coconut milk, and piping hot. The chicken in it was equally pleasing due to its moist, curry inundated state. It's definitely a dish that'll keep you going if you want a big lunch.

The food is good, but you'll want to avoid coming in large groups. They only have a handful of four-tops and one that seats six, so any larger may cause difficulties. 

But if you're going to roll in one afternoon for lunch, go for it."}
{"text":"let me just say that i've been to my fair share of thai restaurants in pittsburgh (bangkok balcony, silk elephant, thai place) and smiling banana leaf definitely has the best dishes at the best prices. 

i came on a wednesday night, so i had no problem getting seated. the hostess/waitress was super friendly and attentive, and our orders came out promptly. i ordered their pad thai (@ 7. i know, i know, i always feel lame ordering pad thai, but i really hadn't had good pad thai in a while...), my friend had their green curry (also @ 7), and we both also ordered thai iced teas.

my pad thai was delicious and at the perfect spiciness level; the 7 for green curry was a /litlte/ too spicy for me, but still really good. thai iced tea was fine, as always.

so overall, nice atmosphere, good food, and friendly service :) no complaints!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at this small Thai restaurant nestled in the heart of the friendly highland park community. We didn't make a Saturday reservation but since we were having an early dinner they sat us. We ordered the fresh rolls with chicken that were very tasty. We had the Tom Yom soup with chicken, the mango salad with chicken, and I had the best pineapple fried rice that I have had yet in the burg ( I don't care for onions so I ordered with out). It's BYOB and excellent"}
{"text":"Wow!  I was hoping it would be good by the other reviews on yelp...and it was!  The food is fresh, delicious and so full of flavor.  You will be blown away with how fantastic it is.  So authentic and truly worth the trip.  I wish we lived closer.  Everything seemed to be made to order and served perfect and I think the best thai I've ever had.  Can't say enough good words about it."}
{"text":"My wife and my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Cosy interior. INCREDIBLE food. Kind staff. Fast service. I could not give a higher recommendation. A hidden gem in the  Highland Park neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great place! Loved the atmosphere & enjoyed our lunch very very much! Will def. return!"}
{"text":"There's not much I can add that hasn't been said already except to say that the Tom Kha soup there is some of the best I've ever had. Saw some folks hating on it down below. The thing is, every Thai place makes it a little differently so it could really just be a matter of taste. Heck, see for yourself. And if you've never had Tom Kha before, this is a great place to start."}
{"text":"A OK place. It's not the real thai food. It's like America-style thai food. I'm not sure why it gets such a high score."}
{"text":"Pad thai was really pretty good but I prefer my noodles uncut. Curry dish was good. The tea leaf salad was a one on scale of one to ten. I'd go back for the other dishes and cute environment"}
{"text":"Although the place is a bit tiny, but it's a good place for Thai foods! I usually have a Tom Yum soup at Thai restaurant, and Smiling Banana Leaf has a good one! We also had a Kee Moa with fish and a yellow fried rice with pork. Omg, both of them are really great! And the size portions are pretty big! For small appetites, one dish can be 2 meals! I'd say the yellow fried rice is the must-eat!"}
{"text":"I came here with bunch of friends and I would say this is probably the best Thai food I have had in Pittsburgh. Very reasonably priced along with great service. Everyone answered any questions that we may have had and had plenty of patience. 

I order the beef Rad Na which compared to what I have had at other Thai establishments throughout the US it was much soupier than what I am used to but still very flavorful. The Tom Yum soup was very much in line with what I have experienced if not better than other places. 

The only real issue I had was with the seating setup in this place. Since we had a large group we had a table that had a wall mounted bench that was just too high for the table. My buddy and I basically had to sit with our waists at table level, A little bit of oversight during design and construction, not that big of a deal but worth mentioning.

Check it out."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place.  I haven't had a bad experience here yet.  They have some of the best Thai iced tea I've had anywhere, and their food is all excellent.  It can get a little cramped inside if it's busy, but you can always order take-out, so I can't hold that against them!  I frequent this place, and my girlfriend and I never get sick of coming here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been disappointed by this restaurant many times now and have finally decided that I am never eating here again.

On multiple occasions I've had horrendous 30+ minute waits for takeout food despite arriving after the time they've listed on the phone.  One time, my girlfriend was ignored by the staff for ten minutes only to annoyingly find out that our food had been sitting on the counter (getting cold) the entire time.

Most recently, after another thirty minute wait despite arriving after their estimate, we finally got our food and went home only to realize that half of the order was completely incorrect.  Waiting over an hour for incorrect food is completely unacceptable.  I will never be returning to this place due to their terrible service."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem located in a tiny space on Bryant St in Highland Park.  The quality of food and accommodation of spiciness level is good for a larger variety of crowd.  Price point, especially at lunch time is very reasonable.  It is nice to be able to get a cup of nice soup (Tom yum, Tom kha, etc) along with your entree and it will be under $15. Mango curry was great!"}
{"text":"For Thai food in Pittsburgh this is about as good as you're going to do. Which is pretty darn good. The menu is pretty standard, they have all the dishes you would expect at a typical Thai place, and maybe a few one's you wouldn't. (Pumpkin curry anyone?) I won't give them too many points for being creative or original, but I will give them points for doing the favorite dishes we know and love very, very well. I will be ordering from them over and over."}
{"text":"Good food. This is our solid go-to when I'm feeling Thai. There are some other popular restaurants in the area, so street parking can be tricky, but I've never landed more than a block away. Seating inside is limited, but lovely, and it's BYOB, so definitely grab a bottle and some friends for a good evening over tasty food! We generally grab take-out here, and I've never had a bad meal. The dry noodles are satisfying, and the pad see eiw is better than most. Definitely grab an order of steamed dumplings. This isn't going to wow anybody, but it's solid, tasty Thai food, and a good I-don't-want-to-cook take-out option."}
{"text":"Heralded as a must-try by multiple sources, I was happy to make it out to Highland Park (seriously underrated 'hood with beautiful old houses btw) and try SBL. Intentional or not, everything is way too safe here. Not much flavor. Did not register even faint blips on the savoriness radar.  

Pacing was horrendous. I'm willing to bet it was more the tiny kitchen than the serving staff (who were super nice). There seemed to be a ton of take out orders so maybe they have to make tough decisions. Whatever the Thai equivalent of those Sesame Inn crunchy noodles might not be the worst idea to tide people over. I also feel immeasurable pity for anyone who has to use the restroom here, as literally every single person in the restaurant will watch you walk in and walk out. Maybe they should convert to take out only or try to rent out the rest of the building they're in."}
{"text":"Quaint corner restaurant in Highland Park.  Very flavorful dishes ---- pumpkin and green curries, the red and green curry noodle dishes, tofu paradise appetizer and tom kha soup are all excellent.  The lemongrass and lime flavors are very fresh.  The hot ginger tea is also very good --- the best when you run in on coldy, snowy nights.  The restaurant space is unique with decorative pillows alongside the perimeter bench seats.  The spice level is no joke - its legit.  I choose a 6-7 / 10.  Spicy enough for me.  When I first came here, I returned two more times the same week, dragging a different person with me each time to share the wonderful meals this restaurant provides.  One of my favorite places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and the best Thai in Pittsburgh.  This is the most authentic Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh.

Their pad thai with tofu, Kao Soy, Green Curry, etc. is superb.  I also like that it's BYOB.

My only complaint is that they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on friday night.  I heard the place was small but man its like a glorified walk in closet.  There were 5 tables of 4 and one table of 3.    The wait wasnt very long but the servers werent  very happy i was by myself.   i found it humorous that i was being discriminating against because of my numerology.  I was even asked if i would prefer take out, i declined of course.  Than, after being seated at a table for four I was asked to switch to a table of three (in mid meal mind you) to accomodate the party of four coming in.   I laughed through the entire ordeal and really didnt blame them.  Like they say in golf \"The ONESOME has no power.\"

Ok enough about me and onto the food.  I started off with a fresh shrimp roll.   It came as advertised, fresh, crunchy and sweet.  For a main course i ordered the pumpkin curry with chicken.  I have never ordered this before so i do not have anything to compare it too.  it came in bowl filled with chicken and pumpkin chunks.  A plate of rice was also served.  It must be ignorance but it always seems like thai places never serve enough rice to go with the curries.  The curry was delicious and the broth had a mild pumpkin flavor but when you included the pumpkin in your bite it had the perfect flavor.   

It was an entertaining but more importantly a delicious meal and I would definitely go back especially in the spring because they do have two tables for outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend upon her suggestion and fell in love!

The interior is unique and colorful, though it's small. The service is very attentive, welcoming and friendly. They refilled my water at least 3 times and responded very patiently to my questions.

The food is solid! The smell of the authentic Thai is so alluring. The look of the food only adds to the temptation! It is evident that they put care into each dish.

The lunch prices are a steal! (They go exclusively by dinner prices on weekends, just so you know.)

I enjoyed the chicken satay as an appetizer and the see yew with chicken, spice level 7 out of 10 and I was super full and content. My friend enjoyed the curry noodles, koy soy!

Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food. We typically do take out but have dined it and enjoy the eclectic decor and very friendly service. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai I've found in Pittsburgh. 

I generally don't bother with anything besides their pumpkin curry (veggies + tofu), because it's ridiculously delicious. Creamy, spicy, subtly sweet...it's also a perfect serving for one sitting.

To avoid being cramped, just try a weeknight or go with a small group. The atmosphere is adorable and great for a date, and they're BYOB. Excellent for takeout too!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, I would give it a 3 stars due to service. This place is BYOB  and no additional fee for corking - definite bonus in my book. Their waitress was new and it was a bit difficult to get someone's attention. It wasn't overly busy when we went on a Monday night, but it took multiple tries to get the attention of the waitresses. 

First impression is that the place is very cute. Has a very hipster rustic feel for being a Thai restaurant. The interior has a good mood lighting - nice atmosphere. It was pretty cold though. Granted I went on a freezing day but we were seated right by the window so it was way more draft than I would have enjoyed. 

TOFU PARADISE --
Wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this but I was surprised. They used a former tofu and cut into bite size pieces. I thought the cabbage was the best part to be honest because it had a little sweetness but not so sweet as the peanut sauce. It was a bit too much for my tastes, but slowly grew on me. 

YELLOW CURRY NOODLES --
This was surprisingly good. A healthy (huge...let's face it it's not really good for you), portion of yellow curry, noodles, bean sprouts, chicken, red onion, and topped with fried onions. I got a 6/10 on the spicy scale and I will give it to them - it was pretty spicy. I think next time I'll go with a 5. If you're not good with spicy foods I would urge you to opt for a 1-2. The broth was really well made and flavored. And there was such a big portion I could have taken the rest to go and had left overs with rice. 

My friend got the pad Thai which I did not try, but I thought her portion was rather small for the dinner price. I expected a bit more. Compared to other Thai restaurants I am inclined to say their portion to price ratio is smaller. 

Their menu offered a pretty wide variety of appetizers, rice, noodle, and other dishes. I will be back to try them."}
{"text":"I'm assuming best Thai food in Pgh, though I can't say I've thoroughly tried the menu.  I always order Tom Yum and Pad Thai (both #5 heat, which still isn't too spicy).  Nice decor and quaintly small inside.  Street parking is surprisingly ample, which makes the drive to Highland Park worth it.  Reasonably priced, the food is full of flavor and not greasy, which I've experienced at other Thai and Pan Asian establishments around Pgh.  As much as I love this place, I wouldn't recommend the fresh spring rolls (For spring rolls, check out the Vietnamese Pho restaurant in the Strip).  Banana's version are a little bland in comparison to the greatness of their other dishes.  Either way, this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place did not disappoint. If there's one issue it's that the restaurant is so tucked out of the way. But, the service was very good, the servings generous, and the atmosphere relaxed."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai places in Pittsburgh.  

We made a reservation which was essential for a group of eleven for dinner on a Tuesday night.  That's the only way they could have accommodated a group our size in such a nice, cozy place.

The appetizers are delicious.  We had a lot of vegetarians in our party and so we got all of the veggie options:  crispy taro spring roll, the tofu paradise and the fried tofu.  We also got an order of the chicken satay and the crab ragoon.  I highly recommend the the tofu paradise.  

But the entrees are also fantastic.  There are a lot of really good options to choose from.  Our group did it family style, so I got to try a lot of different options.  My favorites of the ones we ordered were the Pad Kee Mao and the Pumpkin Curry.  

The place is BYOB.  And they take cards - which is always uncertain in Pittsburgh - and a plus in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is doing everything just right- quality of food is perfection, ambiance is cozy and intimate, prices are reasonable, and BYOB comes with no corking fee. The mango curry was one of the best curries I've ever had. Also, everything came out super fast."}
{"text":"I've only ever had SBL when it's been delivered to be by 3rd party service Happy Bellies, but each of the two times I have ordered, I've been very happy with what I've tasted, the last time being this past Saturday. Their spring rolls are invariably fresh, and I agree that this is one of the better places to have Pad Thai in the Pittsburgh area, which is what I had, with beef over the weekend, and really enjoyed. I will echo what some others have said regarding their heat index being more tailored to American tastes, I ordered an spice level 9 of 9 for my Pad Thai, and in comparison to other Thai spots like Nicky's, or Thai Me Up on the Southside, a 9 is mild. That being said, flavor of dishes here is great, 4/5."}
{"text":"I was debating between 6 different Thai restaurants I had bookmarked on here, and ended up going with the cheapest one.  I'm so glad I did, because I think I found a new favorite.

As previous reviewers have mentioned, it is tiny, but I didn't feel too cramped.  Our server was very nice and friendly and the food arrived very promptly.  They were out of Thai iced teas, but we ordered Thai samosas ($4.50 for 4), a massaman curry minus the peanuts ($9.50), a Coke ($1.50), and a chicken pad thai ($8.50).  The Thai samosas are delicious - the filling is creamy and the cucumber sauce is great.  The massaman curry was pretty good.  I thought the rice-curry ratio was good, and there were good chunks of potato and tofu, plus peas and carrots.  I thought it could have used a touch more flavor.  The pad thai wasn't bad but wasn't the best.  We ordered it with a spice level of 8, which seemed pretty accurate.

We didn't order desserts but they were $5.  They offered fried bananas, a taro custard, and two other which I can't remember.  Our total was $25.  We are both eager to come back and try some more dishes on their menu.  BYOB."}
{"text":"Ever since the change in ownership, this place has gone from being a jewel of a Thai restaurant to a Siberian sweatshop.  There is a quite unpleasant comrade at the front desk who was as gracious as road kill.  The interior went from sunny and bright to dull, white and as ingratiating as a gulag.  The food was still good and maintaining it's own.  The big finale came upon exiting, when we went to the cashier to have an item removed from the bill which we had neither ordered or eaten.  \"Boris\" asked, 'How do I know you didn't order it?' I simply stated that the server agreed with us and that it was a mistake.  He agreed with the logic and when I asked what the total of the bill was now, he simply held up a calculator to our faces.  Not a word or even a glance in our direction.  If your plans involve take out, I would say that you will have a wonderful experience.  Otherwise..."}
{"text":"Best chicken Pad Thai ever. Seriously. I live in NYC, where there are as many Thai restaurants as cabs, and after having tried at least 20 different places, I can say this is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is a charming little Thai restaurant located in the heart of Highland Park. I ended up calling in for a reservation about an hour and a half before arriving on a Saturday evening, and when we arrived, we were seated right away. Even though the restaurant wasn't entirely full when we came in, my dad and I ended up waiting for about 10 minutes before the waiter came out with water and to get our orders in.

The food was excellent! I ordered the chicken yellow curry noodles with a spicy rating of 3. Firstly, I would like to admit that I am an absolute WUSS when it comes to my spiciness tolerance. So while most normal people would find a 3 on the bland side, I ended up drinking a few glasses of water and having to ask the waiter to fill up our pitcher of water again because of the spiciness. Nevertheless, I found the curry absolutely delicious and ate as much of it as I could!

My only gripe about this place is that since the restaurant is very small, the seating is a little bit crammed and the outer benches where some of the tables are situated are a little uncomfortable. Additionally, since the place is on the smaller side, it can fill up very quickly so I would definitely call ahead to make a reservation.

All in all, I had a wonderful time at Smiling Banana Leaf and would definitely recommend this place to my Thai food-loving friends!"}
{"text":"Great Thai Food in Pittsburgh!  Their curry noodles are simply amazing!  So are rest of the dishes on their menu... Pad Kee Mao, Curry, Satay and others.   They serve great portions.  Cozy place to have warm and spicy food indoors during winters, and pretty outdoor seating for rest of the season!  Always eat here when I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Everyone's food was ok. Our service was just ok (we had difficulty understanding our server) and there was NO room to sit inside. The restaurant is tiny. The bathrooms were not well kept either...go here if it is your only option."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time yesterday and I had high expectations given the yelp love. by and large they went unfulfilled. 

The room is small, some would call it cozy, but it did not look particularly friendly to me. It smelled weird too, something like cleaning product - perhaps the product used on the tables or perhaps a smell from the bathroom (speaking of which, the door of the corridor to the bathroom does not close properly, really annoying if you are near it...). and it was not very warm. I even considered not staying... 

The service was so ... slow. the  waiter being alone a wednesday evening. I know it's not his fault but management should make sure that 2 people are working there until closure.  

The food was perfectly fine, but not outstanding. Our curry and spicy pastas were tasty, but not memorable. hard to see why i would cross town for it."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times, and the food is great. But on a day when it was 15 degrees out, my black girlfriend and I decided we wanted some warm Thai food. When we got in there were 12 empty seats. We were asked if we had reservations and we said no. We were then told the only place we could be seated was right by the door. We were ok with that, but less than five minutes later a white couple came in, said they didn't have reservations and got a seat that was not next to the door and the freezing weather. The white couple also got served before us. Unfortunately we'll be looking for a new Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, which isn't the easiest thing in the world."}
{"text":"THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON OTHER REVIEWS FOR THIS PLACE START IN ALL CAPS!

It's because this place is de-freaking-licious!

If you read my other reviews on Thai places, you'll see I always get the Pad Thai as my point of comparison.  This place served me the best Pad Thai I've ever had!  My wife was pissed at me because I was too busy stuffing my face to talk to her.  The dish struck the perfect balance of deliciousness with the sweet Pad Thai sauce, scrumptious chicken, peanuts, and green onions.  The sauce was incredible.  Pad Thai I've had elsewhere is usually too bland or overpoweringly sweet and fake.  Instead, Smiling Banana Leaf has cemented itself in my mind as the gold standard for Pad Thai.

In the midst of stuffing my face with noodles, I managed to set aside some time to breathe and take in the atmosphere.  I'm glad I called ahead for a reservation because there were only a dozen or so tables in the restaurant--and it was packed.  The lighting was low and the setting was intimate.  I would definitely recommend this place for a date night--if you can control how fast you eat...  Remember to get a bottle of wine beforehand (unlike me).  It's BYOB."}
{"text":"Love there thai basil chicken. One of the best ones I have had. Very small place inside but all food had been delicious."}
{"text":"Great Thai food and Thai iced coffee. Service was friendly and they do have outdoor seating. I will definitely return for more great Thai food."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food! Everything I've tried at Smiling Banana Leaf has been delicious and fresh. I usually order take out and they are always very friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Very quick preparation and was ready for pickup in 10 minutes! The food was very flavorful and fresh. We had the dumplings, they were a little smaller than dumplings I'm used to. We had the yum mooyang salad, Pad Thai and Tom Kha soup. I would order each dish again. The Yum Mooyang salad was my favorite of the 3 dishes. Located in a quiet neighborhood near the park."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that Smiling Banana Leaf exists. It's one of my go-to takeout meals. Admittedly, I tend to stick to the chicken pineapple fried rice and chicken pad thai, but both are so delicious and the portions are huge. I always have leftovers. The staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Very tasty.  My first experience with Smiling Banana Leaf was with takeout.  Everything was ready on time and piping hot.  The pad Thai is great as is the garlic preparation (I had it with beef).  I'm also a fan of the dumplings.  The restaurant itself is a bit cramped, but the service the one time I at inside was friendly and efficient.  I will likely return for takeout many times."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The traditional cuisine is tasty and not too expensive. I had the green curried tofu, which was amazing and just spicy enough. The place is small, intimate, and the owners and wait staff are incredibly nice. My brother lived in Thailand for two years and I took him here when he visited Pittsburgh. He ended up talking Thai with the owner for the rest of the night- they loved him as much as we loved the restaurant. If you're in the mood for Thai and can drive a little outside of the East End bubble, it's a must-do."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food!  Well worth the search in Highland Park to find it!

We went last night with friends who are vegetarian and so we had a variety of dishes at our table.  We started with the fried spring rolls - a little garlicky but other than that, fresh and tasty and crisp!

I ordered the Pad See Ew with shrimp.  The shrimp were small but they were plentiful.  The sauce was a little different - it was a soy based that almost tasted sweet and sour - it was quite tasty.  We weren't sure what \"temp\" to order things not having been there before  - I ordered a 5 but would probably move up to a 6 next time as they are on par with the usual Thai restaurant we go to.  It was the best kind of heat - you could taste it but it didn't build or last long, so you could taste all the flavors coming through.  My preference is always heat but not overpowering heat.  DH ordered his favorite green curry and gave it two thumbs up - while I didn't taste it, the smell was just heavenly (it was so good, he wasn't offering to share :(.  The other couple ordered the Choo Curry Tofu which was a basic red curry with tofu and the Tofu eggplant with basil which was loaded with both tofu and what looked like the smaller Asian eggplant.

The restaurant is quite tiny - perhaps they can seat 20 there.  We arrived on a cold snowy Sunday evening at 630 without a reservation (we bad).  They suggested that we walk up the street to the coffee shop and they would call us as soon as a table was ready.

Definitely worth the trip - just call first!"}
{"text":"Just finished the Pad Ped Talay. Delicious! Just the right spiciness with squid, shrimp, fish and bay scallops. I had a taste of the SBL Fish Special with the sweet and sour sauce. Tasty. The place was small, but nicely decorated. We were trying to figure when we could come back without getting lost. It was a little hard to find."}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here about once or twice a month...


But there are some truths that must be shared. I agree with the earlier review that everything tastes like it has fish sauce in it (& I love fish sauce.) 

The place is tiny and could use a fresh coat of paint and some cleaned up chairs. 

I never have a problem getting a table around 7pm. 

I order the red curry or the pineapple or pumpkin curry (which both have the red curry as a base.) 

I love the crispy duck salad. And the Tom yum is ridiculously amazing. 


Prices are reasonable too. For three courses I usually pay $25."}
{"text":"The food is cheap and authentic Thai. Although somewhat cramped, the ambiance is much nicer than an average Thai restaurant, and the take-out service is reliable. The staff is also very nice. If you like hot food, their scale is  well calibrated (10 is very hot). If you do not like your food hot, play it safe and ask for something extremely mild."}
{"text":"We are visiting Pittsburgh so just following the yelp reviews, it did not disappoint us!
We ordered 
Tom Yum Soup, Glass noodles Salad, Green Curry and they were all delicious. 

The only thing with them was a short of labor... as the service was a little bit slow. But overall it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Great meal.  We started with the shrimp spring rolls and steamed dumplings and both were very good, especially the sauces.  I had the green curry with noodles and shrimp.  It came with egg plant, broccoli and green beans.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My wife and son enjoyed their meals as well."}
{"text":"Love the Panang Chicken Curry. Service second time there was not as friendly (first time great service) but food is so good it made up for it!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh! So far, I haven't tried a Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, or Tom Kha as good as Smiling Banana Leaf's. To have three dishes that can't be topped elsewhere calls for 5 stars. 

I like the noodles here because they come in large servings, spice-levels seem accurate, and they are generous with the protein and vegetables. The noodles also seem to have a savory smokey flavor (perhaps from the wok), that I have not tasted anywhere else. In addition to great food, I've never had an issue with service. The wait staff are always friendly and the food always arrives quickly. 

Although the space is small, the food is worth the tiny squeeze."}
{"text":"This place is pretty small...maybe room for about 30 people. Though lots of people do takeout from here, so I have never had to wait very long for a table. Servers are nice, though sometimes you wonder what happened to your drink. The pad thai was good, but not great. The cashew chicken was tasty. I enjoyed the cashew dish with tofu even more....fluffy cubes browned on the outside and soft inside....though they skimp on the cashews, which are the best part! I could drink the thai iced teas every day. 
I am a spice wuss, so I can't speak to that part of the meal. I order a 2/10 and still have to drink water like crazy."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think the Thai food here is better than Noodlehead's. I do wish their dishes were spicier. They use that 1-10 scale and had the 9 but wasn't very spicy. Their 9 would be my 7 at the most.

Their curries are delicious as well!"}
{"text":"As someone who is new to the Thai food scene, I thought this place knocked it out of the park! We started with the crab Rangoon which was fabulous! I tried the mango curry with extra veggies! It AMAZING! such a unique flavor and I love the veggies that it was mixed with. 

The restaurant is very small, but sometimes I like that vibe! It is a nice place for a quiet intimate date night or to catch up with girlfriends over your own bottle (BYOB is the best - am I wrong?!) 

My only complaint was there was only two of us and our food didn't come out at the same time. That is a big pet peeve for me and with such a small restaurant, I didn't think it was necessary. 

There is a lot of street parking in Highland Park so that wasn't an issue and they take reservations which I would highly recommend making! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yuuuuum best thai in the burg! Super warm and cozy inside, small, though so I suggest making a reservation.   Byob, and I've certainly shared some drinks with fellow diners thanks to the cozy seating arrangements."}
{"text":"What a cute place!  We would never have come here if not for the Yelp reviews, so good job on that one, yelpers!

I'm not sure what they do in the winter, because this place is TINY.  The amount of outdoor seating is equivalent to the amount of indoor seating (which is probably somewhere around 10 people per space), so make reservations if you know you're going.  The service is fantastic - they are SO friendly!  It feels like a real neighborhood restaurant, which it is - totally tucked around the corner off Negley.

Some of the food was good, and some could have been better.  We started with the crispy calamari and steamed dumplings, both of which were fine.  I think we wished that there was a little more calamari than there was.  We then shared the pumpkin curry, pad see ew, and green curry.  Hands down, the pad see ew was the best we'd had in Pittsburgh, definitely on par with Green Mango, and potentially even better.  However, the consensus around the table was that the curry dishes were not as good as those at Green Mango - they seemed a little on the watery side.  Perhaps not enough coconut milk (some of them specifically that they are not made with coconut milk, so there's that).  Mainly, they just didn't seem as... \"taste\"y as others we'd had before.  Also, the pumpkin was a touch undercooked and was tough.

But we loved the fresh mango with sweet sticky rice dessert, perhaps even more than the fried banana dessert with ice cream.  This is all to say, we're happy to have found another good thai place in town, and the service is just so cute that we'll have to keep on going back."}
{"text":"We picked up some Smiling Banana Leaf to-go after a strenuous yoga class.  I had the panang curry and my husband had the green curry.  We both enjoyed the flavors very much, and I noted that the veggies used were great choices.  I thought that the portion size was a bit small compared to what I've received at other Thai places.  I also was not that happy with the shrimp.  They were very chewy, and it might have been because it was to-go and they sat in hot liquid and got overcooked, but either way, the flavor wasn't very fresh on the shrimp either.  I would say the goods outweighed the bads though, and I would probably just get a vegetarian version next time.  The service was pleasant and quick for how busy they were."}
{"text":"I feel like I need to try the Thai here again, because everyone else seems to love it so much. It was good, don't get me wrong, but my 9 spicyness wasn't that spicy :( That always makes me sad. Other than that the food was good, but not what I would call the best ever... Maybe the best in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've been around the world, and I've seen a lion, and I think this is the best Thai food I've ever eaten. 

Word to the wise: I asked for a 3 (out of ten) in terms of spiciness, and it had a good kick despite. If you want mild, say you want it at 1."}
{"text":"I had to walk out on an incredibly disappointing meal I *Have **Had*** a good meal @ this place in prior years, yet I will NOT pay for cooked frozen vegetables, burnt spring rolls, arrogant management.; overall thorough disappointment!  I will undoubtedly NEVER return to this venue!  Save yourself from an epic disappointment!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to head over here after seeing all of the glowing reviews on Urbanspoon. Also, it's practically in my back yard and I'm always up for some Thai food.

The problem with most Thai restaurants is that nothing really sets them apart. If you were blindfolded and a number of Pittsburgh Thai restaurants set down plates of the same dish you'd probably have a very hard time picking them apart. Luckily, The Smiling Banana Leaf managed to carve itself a niche in the Thai-saturated streets of Pittsburgh.

Just by looking at the bustle inside the restaurants shows you how good the place is. There's only five tables inside yet they are always filled with happy, hungry people. Customers are constantly coming in and out for take-out and the smells coming from the kitchen are amazing. The restaurant is intimate without being intimidating.
The server we had was great. She was very upbeat and made small talk with us. She kept our waters filled and was attentive even though she was responsible for all five tables and a lot of the take-out ordering. Her warm demeanor alone makes The Smiling Banana Leaf the kind of restaurant you want to come back to.

The food was excellent, by the way. To start we branched out from our usual and got \"Tofu Paradise\". The tofu was crispy on the outside and soft, warm and flavorful on the inside. The peanut sauce, something I usually do not care for, was smooth and perfectly balanced between sweet and savory. It went well with the veggies that were cooked but still crispy.

The Tom Yum soup was served in a heaping bowl and had a brilliant red color to it. The pieces of chicken were hearty and the lemon grass was delicious. It wasn't my favorite, though. I like the soup to be really sour and this was more sweet tasting. To each his own, though! It was still prepared expertly. The fact that their dishes vary in flavor to other restaurants means to me that the chef is taking great care in cooking his food. It's like all cooking, depending on the tastes of the cook certain flavors may be emphasized or downplayed.

I ordered the Spicy Green Bean entree and thought it was delicious. The sauce was spicy and tangy but also had some curry notes to it. Occasionally the spiciness would subside and you'd get smooth hints of coconut. Usually I'm not a fan of Thai sauces but I found myself sopping it up with my chicken and veggies.

For dessert we had the epitomical Thai dessert, Thai custard and sticky rice. The portions were perfect for two people and much more generous than I usually get. The bill at the end of the meal was very fair and surprisingly cheap.

The Smiling Banana Leaf is my new favorite Thai Place. It absolutely oozes charm."}
{"text":"Very good Thai at a reasonable price in a relaxed atmosphere. The fresh rolls (rice wrapper), wide noodle dishes, and curry dishes are especially good. Lots of strong vegetarian options. The place is small, but nice, with outside seating for nice days. The staff are medium friendly. Definitely a good place for lunch or dinner with a small group."}
{"text":"I guess I will join the dozens of other Yelpers who love Smiling Banana Leaf. I've eaten at at least 5 other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, but this is the one to which I keep returning. It helps that it is quite close to my apartment, but even when I lived across town, I still visited frequently. After 2 years in Pittsburgh, I am comfortable calling this my favorite restaurant. I love how cozy the restaurant is and how it is one of the few BYOB restaurants I have found here that does not have a corkage fee. 

I have sampled several menu items - all of the noodles (except Pad Thai... peanuts and I do not agree) and several of the curries. My hands down favorite is the Pad See Ew, preceded by the samosas appetizer. 

When my parents visited Pittsburgh, I took them to Smiling Banana Leaf, despite the fact that my father absolutely hates Thai food. He absolutely loved the Pad See Ew and told me days later, on the phone: \"I was just thinking about that Thai restaurant we went to and how good it was.\" 

I've had Pad See Ew at every other Thai restaurant I have visited, and Smiling Banana Leaf is the best place to get it. It's delicious. 

So why 4 stars? Well, when the curries are good, they're really good, but I have occasionally found them to be a bit watery for my taste. Plus I tend to sweat and cry even on level 2 spiciness. The brown rice though, is made of many different colors of brown rice and is delicious. Also, my boyfriend and I have had some takeout troubles - once the woman at the desk forgot to give our order to the kitchen and the other time, the kitchen forgot to put chicken in my Pad See Ew. Service is always great when we eat in the restaurant though!"}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is a must for Thai food lovers.  Amazing food, excellent service and a quaint atmosphere for a casual lunch or dining.  I would highly recommend it to any one living in Pittsburgh.

Food:
The food is simply delicious.  I would highly recommend getting the Chicken Paradise, any of the curry and the appetizers.  Each are a nice portion, but may be small for a big eater.  Lunch prices are around $8 while dinner hovers around $10-12.  For the quality, these prices are unmatched.  I would recommend Smiling Banana Leaf over Bangkok Balcony any day.

Service:
The owner? of the restaurant is very friendly and will make your visit even more memorable.   Dinner hours are quite busy.  Due to the limited seating and the popularity, you may have to wait for a while to get a table.

BYOW is a nice touch.

**May 2011**
The food seemed undercooked / overcooked for the first time.  I did not see the usual owner?.  perhaps the owner / cook changed?  not sure.  was disappointed."}
{"text":"After visiting Nicky's Thai Kitchen, I was expecting even more from the Smiling Banana Leaf, as per the reviews--but I was a little let down. 

I'm not sure if my ordering was off, but I found a theme in sauces and dressings that were just too sweet. 

We started with the spring roll, steamed dumplings and the calamari. The spring roll was quite good, steamed dumplings were very light and well seasoned and the calamari was good, but a bit overcooked. It was a little too chewy because of it, but it wasn't a bit greasy and the coating was perfect. However, the dipping sauce was extremely sweet and almost like jam. I preferred the dumpling dipping sauce for it. 

The glass noodle salad was heavily, heavily dressed with a dressing that would have benefitted from  healthy does of acid and much less sweetness. However, the meat in the salad was generous and the shrimp in the salad was well cooked. The vegetables, specifically the onions, were rather huge pieces, while there seemed to be an under representation in the \"greens\" department. Honestly, by the time I finished my salad I couldn't really taste a whole lot because it was just SO sweet. 

The pad thai, at a 7 level hotness, wasn't very hot. And again, it was pretty sweet. There weren't very many bean sprouts and the meat chunks were huge. The curried noodles, at a hotness of 5, had a delicious sauce, but the noodles were pretty overcooked. 

It could be, we caught the restaurant on a off day, as it was a holiday weekend. It could be, I just ordered badly, as the neighboring diners food looked delicious. The ambiance is quite adorable and the service is good. I would give it another shot before declaring it a no-go zone."}
{"text":"The food keeps getting better! Had take-out tonight and our selections were extemely good. I'd rank it as an equal with  the Green Mango and Nicky's. Its only problem is its small dining room, but I don't mind taking it home. 

We had chicken pad thai (heat = 4), curry fried rice with veggies, chicken satay and shrimp and veggie spring rolls."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch for the first time. I had the cashew stir fry with tofu and it was delicious."}
{"text":"That's it. I'm never eating Thai in PGH again. I visit my boyfriend from NYC every month and though I look forward to seeing him, I don't look forward to the dining options here. This (from Yelp reviews) is supposed to be the best Thai in the city, but it's really just below average Thai food. 

We tried new things this time and with each bite, I kept thinking about Sripraphai in NY. That restaurant both spoiled and ruined me.

The panang curry was watery, lifeless, and just really sad. A few strips of carrots and bell pepper. 4 small broccoli and a few pieces of pork. Really?? For that price?

The fried calamari was overly breaded that I couldn't taste the squid. If you told me they were onion rings, I might believe you. Also a severely small portion.

The sticky rice we ordered was HALF A CUP size. I was floored!

The papaya salad was fine, but I was most disappointed that our waitress didn't give us the dessert menu. She took away our plates and just handed us the check. From what my boyfriend told me, she's a terrible waitress (the short one).

As my boyfriend and I were walking out of the restaurant, we both agreed that it will be the last time we go there. I'm just going to bring him Thai food from Sripraphai straight off the plane."}
{"text":"I would make this 4 1/2 stars if i could because of the size but  the pad thai is incredible. i can't bring myself to try anything else.  I started at a 2 in spiciness but now go 7 or 8.  As the rating bar indicates - Woohoo! As good as it gets."}
{"text":"My family and I came here and had a wonderful time. The food was delicious and the restaurant staff was so kind. 

My wife had the red curry, I had the pad kee mao, my brother had an eggplant dish and my parents got a special with shrimp. They were all delicious. We enjoyed two bottles of wine together (it's BYOB) and had a wonderful night at a cute neighborhood place."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this restaurant. The atmosphere is homey and I wanted to linger long after my meal was done. The food, however, left me a little underwhelmed, although I admittedly have high standards for Thai food. The appetizers that I ordered were spot on; the fresh rolls with shrimp were refreshing and light, while the satay chicken had great flavor and came with delicious sauces. The red curry, which I ordered with vegetables, was way too sweet. Achieving the right balance in curry can be hard, but this one was so sweet that I had to force myself to finish the portion I had on my plate. On another visit, I ordered the Pad Thai which seemed like it was missing something. The flavors weren't developed and I didn't enjoy it. The service is warm and personal, although the restaurant is always busy. Give it a try; you might love it, like some of my friends, or you might like other places better, but it's worth a shot."}
{"text":"Nice little neighborhood place. Reasonable prices and authentic food. The dining area is a little small,  though I think they do a lot of take out. Only thing to watch for is when they say hot, they mean hot. If you are a spicy wimp (like I am) go with the 0, and work your way up."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and super affordable. It's tiny but so gorgeous inside. The menu has a lot of options with choice of a protein without extra charge. Don't leave without getting a Thai iced tea! This is our new go-to favorite Thai place. We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Very reasonable preice and wonderful staffs"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai place located in Highland Park. Absolutely love the intimacy of the place and the fact that it is BYOB!  My friends and I went on a Thursday night. It gets pretty packed in there, for the place isn't that big, so I encourage you to make a reservation. 

Got there and ordered appetizers. I got the crispy taro spring rolls. I didn't really like this dish. There were unexpected potatoes making it heftier than normal spring rolls. I wasn't a fan. 

For my entree, I got the pineapple fried rice which is very different than my normal pad Thai! It was such a good choice. The portion was enormous and I was able to take some home. 

I enjoyed to service in the place. I just wish they would have cleared our table more promptly and especially without us having to ask. With everything, we barely had enough room for our plates and the wine."}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place. It is cozy, the food is great, and the people that work there are very friendly. I've tried a variety of the dishes and haven't had a bad one. I particularly like the masaman curry, Thai samosas, and anything with their peanut sauce. Even if Banana Leaf were not a mere block away I would frequent the place!"}
{"text":"Best thai food i have eaten in pittsburgh.  We ordered the  dumplings the sauce to go with it was excellent we also tried the soup i didntthink i would like a coconut based soup but it was also great.  We ate the ginger dish and the panang curry both were excellent the sauces and flavors are both top notch.  We finished with the fried banana dessert which i recommend to anyone.  I love spicy food and ordered 8 stars the other dish was 3 stars both dishes had a lot of spice so if you are not a spicy food kinda person get 0 to 2 stars regardless though the Food gives this place 5 stars on top of the food the service was great.and the resturant while not fancy or very spacious was a great cozy place on a sunny afternoon.  I will eat here again whether it is dine in or take out. 5 stars  This place is a must try here in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is legitimate.  I got the Shrimp Tom yum soup, which was tasty.  The chicken fried rice was delicious.  I ordered an \"8\" in spiciness, I should have ordered a \"6.\"  The wait staff was average.  This is one of the better Thai places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai in Pittsburgh, at least when it comes to my stand-by dish, pumpkin curry. Giving four stars due to lackluster service that I received during my last SBL visit (which might have been only the second time I've dined in there). Nonetheless, delicious!"}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious. One of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. If you are dining in, the restaurant is very small but intimate and clean. I have dined in and ordered take. Portions are large and you can make your meal spicy if you want."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad Thai for take-out. It was kind of mushy and greasy. I really wanted to love this place since it has gotten such good reviews but I just did not enjoy my meal. Maybe I'll come back and try something else."}
{"text":"Great little place we just stumbled upon.  Great food.  Good price. Service was a little slow. Over all. Very good find"}
{"text":"Wow. This place has a lot of reviews!

Anyways, we had dinner here. It was decent. The fried tofu app was a little bland.

I had the cashew rice with tofu. They definitely give more tofu than other places around. Standard fare--nothing outstanding but nothing awful either."}
{"text":"\"No sign on the front means this place is going to be the shit!\"-- Says my roommate. 

And that, it was. We began our magical thai food experience with the fresh spring rolls and mango salad, which were both DELICIOUSSSS, fresh and addictive. Then we tried the tom kua soup. As a typical favorite spicy coconut soup of mine, I knew what to expect, or so I thought. This soup, was like a warm, coconut, creamy orgasm in my mouth! Literally. We both licked the bowl clean, there was some major food porn happening over at table 5. 

After the coconut soup came (was that pun intended?) the pumpkin tofu curry arrived at our table with a blob of rice. SO Abso-freaking-lutely amazing! Big chunks of spicy tofu with moist pumpkin bits. We devoured that dish as well. Never had a better tofu in my life.

Did I mention our bombtastic waitress/waiter/transgender thai woman/man that was so cute and bowed to us and spoke thai? So awesome! Ah. I love. I wish I could go back. Only $28 dollars for the best thai food of my life. So ridiculously cheap it's embarrassing if you live in Pittsburgh and have not been to the Smiling Banana Leaf yet... Go now! Oh and it's BYOB! God. Why did I ever move?"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and is always the right level of spiciness. I love the Tom kha soup and massaman curry. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because the waitress has always been somewhat rude. Even when it's not busy, she always seems inconvenienced/annoyed. The food makes it worth it, but I'm thinking next time I'll get take out instead."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend the other day for lunch. We were walking around Highland Park and did a search on his phone for good restaurants nearby. When this came up it sounded like a good idea, but it took us a minute to find it even though we were standing right across the street! The signage is a little odd and not next to the entrance.

We got in, and it was a very small, cute place, with furniture/decor that we instantly recognized as Ikea =). We shared some chicken satay appetizers, and I had Pad Kee Mow and I think he may have had the Rad Na. Everything was delicious! Service was good. Nicely priced lunch specials. No complaints =)

The one thing I guess is that it's really small, so don't plan any large parties here. There was also a little outdoor seating, but it was way too hot out the day we went for that."}
{"text":"Amazing! The hostess/server was wonderful and so kind. Food is excellent and a bit addicting."}
{"text":"Samosas!

Ah, I finally made it to Smiling Banana Leaf!  Being the fine purveyor of all things curry and Pad Thai, I was excited to finally grub down at this corner bound spot in Highland Park.

Here's what lived up to the hype (no need to rehash the details already covered):

1.  The Samosas
2.  The curries (particularly the red)

Here's what left a bit to be desired:

1.  The Pad Thai
2.  The curries (particularly the natural)

So what's that mean?  Smiling Banana Leaf is definitely a good spot, but would I say it's the best Thai in Pittsburgh...  no.  It has some great dishes it hits out of the park, yet it has others which don't particularly have a lot of flavor.  Do yourself a favor and just do a little research prior to going.

As for the space itself, this place is small.  I'd say reservations are a must on the weekend and make sure you bring a light jacket (at least for where I was sitting, the vent above me insisted on blowing cold air ... in December).  The staff were courteous as well (although not particularly helpful in offering recommendations)."}
{"text":"Love the pineapple fried rice and both types of spring rolls. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"I DO NOT understand why this place gets such good reviews. First, I *live* down the street from Smiling Banana Leaf, so I've had the dubious pleasure of going there more than once. Each time, I go and hope it'll be better--but it never is. 

First: the chicken is pre-cooked before it's inserted into whatever curry you order. WHY hasn't anyone else realized this? It's always gummy, and sometimes it's downright odd-tasting. In fact, if you look through the kitchen doorway on the way in, you can SEE the big bin of pre-cooked chicken. 

That's IF you manage to find the chicken in your selected curry at all. Last time I was there, I ordered the mussaman curry. As some other reviewer pointed out, it had crinkle-cut carrots in it. I ordered the extra chicken. The extra chicken tasted odd, but at least it was on the plate. The time before that, I got the green curry and it came with possibly eight pieces of thin chicken bits.

Another time, I ordered the pad thai. \"Pad thai,\" I thought, \"hard to f**k that up.\" It came in a nondescript brown sauce, no vegetables, very little tofu, and black bits stuck to the egg in the noodles. 

The Pad See Ew is OK if you're hungry, but feels somewhat one-dimensional.

And then there's the issue of their fried dumplings. Who sticks these things in a deep fryer? The last time I had them, they were unpleasantly crispy and overly oily. 

Anyway, I'm posting this because I can't for the life of me understand why this place is rated so highly. It's mediocre at best. Seriously."}
{"text":"I was in the Highland Park area and wanted to grab a bite. The restaurant itself is very small. Luckily, it was a Saturday afternoon so few tables were occupied. The pad thai was so-so. A little sweet but nothing to rave about. Other patrons seemed to be enjoying their food so I guess I ordered the wrong dish. Service was fast, friendly and efficient. The owner/manager was very friendly and talked to everyone. I would probably get take-out or sit outside to eat as it gets very stuffy inside. Will give it another try."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is my favorite Thai restaurant in the East End! If you eat in, the restaurant is very small, and I would recommend making a reservation. The service is always fantastic, and I never feel rushed, even if we sit for a while over dinner.

It's BYOB, which I love! The prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food. The fresh rolls are delicious-my favorite starter. The red curry is my favorite. I also love the pad kee mao, which is loaded with basil. However, their spice scale is no joke, so consider that if you attempt you go hotter than a \"5.\"

They are usually very quick with takeout, which is great. I live about 10 minutes away, and if I call before I leave, it's always ready when I get there. Like I said, excellent service!

Give this place a try, or maybe don't, so I'll have an easier time getting a reservation at my favorite little Thai place."}
{"text":"It's been a lot of times that they have given us the wrong order. The staff is very rude and keeps arguing over things. A few years ago this restaurant used to be the good but not anymore. We live a few houses away from this restaurant on Bryant Street and used to go there a lot but not anymore because of bad experience we had since last few times."}
{"text":"I had no idea banana leaves smile, but that's beside the point.  This place is fantastic.  It's kind of a hole in the wall neighborhoody sort of place in Highland Park.  The food is absolutely delicious.  I had the veggie pad thai which was made appropriately spicy as I requested.  It came out fresh, hot and full of veggies.  Seriously, the quality of food here rivaled some Thai restaurants I've been to out in the Bay Area where amazing Thai food is like a dime a dozen. 

The outdoor seating is a great feature of this restaurant, especially on a nice cool evening when you can just hang out, eat some great food with great company and just people watch.  Almost like a cafe in some sense.  Very refreshing and unique.  Asides from the stupid bus stopping every 20 minutes by the corner of the restaurant, you almost forget that you're in Pittsburgh.

Seriously though, the value here is tremendous.  Plenty of food for your buck.  BYOB if that's thing your thing.  Service is solid and can be somewhat personable, which certainly isn't a bad thing.  Finally, a place that can go toe-to-toe with Pusadee's Garden; check it out!"}
{"text":"I literally walked in to the Smiling Banana Leaf not knowing what to expect, and I am not ashamed to say that I was totally blown away and fully satisfied after my afternoon adventure there for lunch..

I will admit that I might be the worst person to ever judge anything Thai, as this was one of the first times I've delved into this particular cuisine, but we showed up being in a hurry looking for a quick lunch only having about 45 minutes to get in and get out, and we were sat and served delicious Thai food with plenty of time to spare.

I ordered the Pad Thai Chicken and asked for a little spice. ( The server asked how spicy I wanted it on a scale of 1 to 10, and I'm pretty sure I said \"not too hot.\") My dish was brought out within ten minutes and I couldn't help but dive right in, even though it was steaming off the plate.

My Pad Thai was delicious. It was perfectly spiced, as it was spicy, but not too spicy to make me take a sip of water after every bite. I loved it, even though I ate it Americanized with a fork instead of chop sticks. 

I will definitely come back and try some of what they have to offer for dinner and I'm looking forward to it."}
{"text":"the food is consistently good, however the service is below average. A friend and I came in to eat last night around 9:15, and we weren't even greeted before a server told us we couldn't sit on the patio because they were closing soon. Although we came there specifically to enjoy the patio, we sat inside. The server was very short with us and rushed us to order - I was also getting food to go and after i told him I'd be ready to order in 2 minutes (at 9:20pm) he came back and told me that the order needed to be in before 9:45. Understandable, since they closed at 10, but I've never been treated in such a way by a restaurant that still had 45 minutes before they closed. They either need to change their hours and close earlier if they don't want any business in the last hour. I encourage everyone to try this place, but don't expect friendly customer service if you stroll in after 9!"}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf has definitely got my attention.  What  a yummy lunch.  We came on a Saturday probably close to 12:30.  We were warned to make reservations since the place is cozy, but we were fairly early for our suspected arrival and were seated near a window at a two top.  I read since the restaurant was tight that on cold days every time the door opened you would get a winter blast.  Lucky for us we must have been seated perfectly since as cold as it was outside we stayed comfy inside.

Our waitress was very cheery.  There was a lady refilling water glasses consistently so no threat of wanting for water.  We started with the fresh summer roll of the day as an appetizer.  We no sooner ordered than the waitress delivered the rolls to us.  At this point we placed our entrée orders and began to enjoy the rolls.

The rolls, which usually is one of the highlights of my dining options, were very mediocre.  There was shrimp in them yet neither me or my husband detected the shrimp.  I was also missing all those wonderful mint and basil flavors that are usually packed into the rolls.  I found them to be quite bland.  The Thai hot paste I requested did enhance the flavor but they were still pretty meh.

Our entrées came out a short time later.  When we eat Thai I never know how hot to order the dishes.  Some places have scales between 1-5, others 1-10, here is 1-10.  I asked the waitress for a suggestion, she asked how hot I like it.  Oh I like it hot!  But I also like to taste my food.  I have been to Thai places where a four will send your taste buds packing so you just never know.  With this information she suggested a 7.  I was hesitant but then again she is the expert.  I asked for more Thai chili paste and red pepper flakes just in case.  I went with the Pad Kee Mao with Tofu, because I just love those fat rice noodles.


Our dishes were served and they looked amazing.  The portion was excellent.  The noodles were prepared perfectly, not too soft or gummy.  They served an ample amount of tofu which is awesome.  Many places skimp on the proteins but not here.  The meal was perfect, save one thing.  A 7 was WAAAYYY too mild.  I dowsed my dish with pepper flakes and paste to drive up the Scoville units.  Other than the lack of spice the flavor was well balanced.  With my few adjustments I was able to create a delicious meal with plenty of leftovers for another meal.  We love a few places on Bryant it's awesome to have another great stop on this street."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with my boyfriend. We are Pitt students and wanted to go somewhere new. This place was perfect. It's pretty hipster and small but the ambiance was fun and relaxed. 
Our waitress was so sweet and helpful. I got glass noodles with chicken and boyfriend got chicken teriyaki. They were both so good!
I will definitely be back to this Thai spot. It was my first time going to a Thai place and I am nothing but pleased. 
Dinner for two was 26 dollars too so it's very inexpensive, which was perfect for two college students. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can get down with the Smiling Banana Leaf. 

The dining room is cozy,  gorgeous and ornate from the jade green glass table tops to the celestial mural painted on the ceiling. Each table had it's own glass vase filled with vibrant yellow tulips too.This was a truly relishable dining experience. 

My waiter had the face of a Calvin Klein model and I detected a Western European accent, was it Austrian, or German? I dunno but he had it going on! 

Any who I had the shrimp tempura , pork dumplings and pineapple curry with shrimp.  The shrimp tempura was cooked too hard and was dark not light. That is the one and only complaint I have for SBL. The shrimp tempura was served with a peanut dipping sauce that was both sweet and tangy and full of peanuts.  The was a very nice touch.  

Thai food has me spellbound.  I cannot seem to get enough , I blissfully devoured every spoonful of my pineapple curry with shrimp. 

SBL is BYOB so I brought along a four pack of wine coolers.  Day drinking at it's finest.  Is BYOB just a dinner thing,  I am still new to the BYOB game."}
{"text":"Small, cheap, reasonably sized portions (yay!), and delicious! This place is tiny, so make a reservation or get take out. I think it's up there with the best Thai in the burgh, but it's cheaper than other locations."}
{"text":"So I have been back here quite a few more times since my original takeout visit.  Each time, whether for take out or dining in, service has been consistently polite and prompt.

Ive been here on a Sunday afternoon when Bobby and I are the only ones in the tiny place and I also stopped by last Friday night for dinner with my dad and Bobby.  At 8pm, the place was stuffed full and a whiff of sweaty muggy people hit me in my face as I walked in the door.  Definitely should have made a reservation.  The host told me it would be about  a 30 minute wait but offered to take my name and phone number if anything opened up sooner.

I stepped outside to decide what we would do and saw 3 outside tables not in use!  With Pittsburgh weather the way that it is, it just so happened to be about 68 that night.  I asked if the host would seat us outside and he agreed.  Shortly after, the other two tables filled!  Lucky us!


At this point I have tried many of their dishes - chicken rad na, yellow curry, pumpkin curry, chicken pad thai and I have had zero complaints.  Bobby tried a noodle soup and it was uneventful.  Really love Smiling Banana Leaf :)"}
{"text":"Food is delicious!!! Been back several times and each time it gets better!! The place is tiny but the food has big taste!! You can call in to reserve and the best time to go is around 5pm! Not crowded but by the time you finish there's usually a crowd waiting!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I tried out Smiling Banana Leaf tonight for dinner, and it was a really enjoyable experience! The Highland Park location was easy to find, and there were even a few cute tables and chairs outside in front. I love al fresco dining, so I'll definitely be back when it's a bit warmer. We walked in and were greeted by the friendly hosts and immediately seated. I loved the vintage looking chairs and eclectic decor. The whole space had a really nice flow to it. 

We soon ordered, and the food came quickly. I got pineapple fried rice (carb loading for a marathon!) and my roommate got the mango salad. Both options were delicious! Everything was hot and perfectly cooked. The spice levels (3 and 4 respectively) seemed accurate. I'd probably get a 6 or a 7 next time for the rice, but for someone who doesn't want spice 3 was perfect! I can't wait to come back and try some of the other options here. Noodlehead has been my go-to Thai place in Pittsburgh, but I wanted to find something other than street noodle Thai and Smiling Banana Leaf is perfect!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food. I tried this place a few years ago back in college and remember it being pretty decent. My memory failed me because \"decent\" is an understatement. Smiling Banana Leaf is delicious! I ordered the Chicken Paradise which is essentially chicken, veggies, and peanut sauce. The Peanut Sauce was unlike I've had anywhere else. It had a very creamy consistency and the peanut taste was definitely there but not too much. It was a beautiful balance. The only thing I disliked was that I ordered a 7 (on a scale of 1-10 for spicy) and it wasn't spicy at all. 

This will be my new go to Thai place!"}
{"text":"I've had much better Thai food in Pittsburgh. Tried this place 3 times now. Not sure what the fuss is about. Royal Myanmar is still the gold standard for me."}
{"text":"A teeny, tiny Thai place - super cute and super small - absolutely delicious very authentic Thai in the way of decor and food. Spicy! I love spice, but woo - this place likes the heat. 

I ordered my typical Tom Yum Soup and Pumpkin Curry. The soup was fantastic, lots of delicious veggies, but I ordered it a little too spicy - and I wanna say I only ordered it at a five...note to self, when ordering something with just broth and no rice or noodles to cut the heat - order with a little less spice than what I think can handle...

The curry was also great, the rice helped the heat situation...and I had a little of my friends Pad Thai (a staple when you're going out for Thai food), which was also very tasty.

Definitely one of the best Thai places in the 'burgh - I wish it was closer to where I live - though that could get dangerous, I could eat good Thai everyday..."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite curry restaurant in Pittsburgh, and I'm particular about my curry!
They have pumpkin curry year-round, which is also a major plus. The Thai Iced Tea is exceptional. The staff are so friendly and accommodating, you feel right at home at this cozy spot!"}
{"text":"Best in the city! By far best curry ive ever had, and the service is great. Our host let us change up ingredients if we wanted to, always had a smile and a joke, and served the best thai ive had in the city! Try the peanut chicken, all the curries, and the calamari! You wont be dissapointed"}
{"text":"Had the green curry noodles and spice level was overshot with a 5 out of 10,but still delicious nonetheless. Awesome Taro spring rolls. Will definitely come back here if I get a chance. Service was great"}
{"text":"Fantastic local Thai with great prices, also great for take-out.Small dining area can create wait times and the space tends to be loud."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the city, and were excited to discover a Thai restaurant so close to our new home. This is a lovely little restaurant for quick take out or a relaxed meal out. We have eaten here once or twice a month since moving, and it never disappoints!

The restaurant space itself is small, but we are usually able to find a seat (we have yet to go on a weekend, so it might be different then!). The staff are friendly and attentive. When they found out about my allergies to fish, they made sure to assist me with locating items on the menu that were safe for me, and constantly checked with the kitchen to ensure that my meal was cooked correctly. We typically start with their Fresh Roll of the Day, which is a large order of fresh rolls with either tofu or some fish product. The dipping sauce is good, but not as tasty as Nicky's Thai Kitchen's peanut dipping sauce. The past few times I have orderedI the Tofu Eggplant dish- I usually substitute chicken for the tofu, which they are happy to do. The sauce is excellent, and the eggplant is perfectly cooked. The portions are generous, so there are always leftovers for the next day!
My husband loves their Green Curry Noodles, enjoying the spicy green curry sauce with chicken and veggies. 

The restaurant is BYOB, so it is a nice, inexpensive place for a night out, and a little more relaxed than Pusadee's Garden, which is right down the hill in Lawrenceville. I highly recommend Smiling Banana Leaf for a great Thai meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Everything we had was flavorful . The steamed dumpling sauce was the perfect combination of tangy and sweet. The decor and design reminds me of restaurants I loved in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai joint in PGH. 

What a delight and thank god for it. I'm shocked it only has 4 stars. I mean the food is bursting with flavor, true to Thai flavors and ingredients. 

First off the food is reasonably priced. With this quality it's again mind blowing that I see only four stars. Thai food isn't just about recreating those classic flavors we love, but it's also different types of textures come to together. Having dined in Thailand (and not fine dined) I'm talking food straight from the sh*$ holes of Bangkok and inner alleys of Phuket, where mom and grandma's recipes take pride and precedence. 

SBL does it right. The meats are cooked PERFECTLY and the curries are have the perfect creaminess to them and the right balance of coconut to spice ratio. Yeah the cliché satay and peanut sauces are there, but what American Thai joint is complete without one. Necessary evil but it's still cooked and grilled to perfection.

Now is it a place bursting with merriment, energy, and hype? No. Is the décor anything to write home about in this little tucked away street in Highland Park? Nope.

But that's what I like about it.

Simple in appearance but complex in flavor.

Overall, a real winner. Best Thai in PGH, period."}
{"text":"There are several excellent Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, but Smiling Banana Leaf is new to me, and I am impressed.  Their kitchen is fast and their food is authentic and delicious.  Their spice level runs a couple points hotter than most other Thai places, so consider backing down a little when you order.

Inside is rather cozy and loud, but outside is definitely my first choice on a nice day.

Our waiter was friendly and attentive.

The prices are extremely reasonable, and there are lots of vegetarian options.  The Smiling Banana is a winner!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this small little restaurant looking for some good eats. Very impressed. We all enjoyed our food and meals were ordered on a 1-10 scale of spice."}
{"text":"I first came here yearsss ago and we really enjoyed our meal, but it's been a while since I returned. A coworker went for lunch one day, came back with leftovers and let me try some. One bite and it was like a spell came upon me. I literally went back there the next day. I ordered the pad kee mao- flat rice noodles, napa cabbage & spicy thai basil, with tofu. It was SO good. The lunch portion was quite large, enough for two meals easily. Although I chose to take-out in order to get back to work quickly, I would have loved to have stayed and dined in. It is so cute inside. So cozy and comforting and I love the paintings on the walls and ceilings. This place is definitely a gem."}
{"text":"Food (pad thai) was too sweet and the portions certainly aren't generous. Their seafood dishes were ok, but a bit too salty. The prices and service are excellent, however."}
{"text":"I have to admit I wasn't wowed by Smiling Banana Leaf during my first visit. I tried the pad thai - boring, I know but I had read so many yelp reviews saying it was the best pad thai in Pittsburgh - and was unimpressed (actually I thought it was kind of dry and lacked that awesome, rich peanuty flavor). I didn't really plan on going back until I was looking for an open restaurant on a Monday night and was in the area but I'm so glad I did. While Smiling Banana Leaf isn't my favorite as far as noodle dishes (Thai Cuisine and it's Spicy Basil Noodles wins there), it is by far and away my favorite for curry in the city. The pumpkin curry, in particular, is truly phenomenal. I love that they don't scrimp on the veggies/meat (no big bowl of sauce here), that the veggies are varied/interesting, that they have really great brown rice for accompaniment, and that the spice level here is actually legit. Granted, when I order a higher spice level the server often second-guesses me, but once I verify that I do indeed want my curry hot, they deliver (something that's been lacking at other Thai restaurants). Also, the spices they use in their curry seem more flavorful rather than just delivering tongue-burning heat."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for a birthday dinner. The place was quaint, very friendly and fast service. Huge portions! I left with a to go box that was as large as a whole meal! A little spicier that your usual Thai joint but, OK with me. I recommend this place very highly for Thai in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Tiny place, like many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, but oh boy is this a gem. I had the Spicy Green Beans with a Vegetable Samosa appetizer, and both were delectable. My date had the Panang Curry, and I honestly couldn't pick which dish I liked more. Friendly staff. Pro tip: don't park in the convenience store lot that  shares a wall with this restaurant, unless the store is closed."}
{"text":"They know their spices! 

Hands down one of the best Thai food places in town! The place is kinda small, but they make up for their delightful and prompt service. Their pumpkin curry is one of my favorite,either tofu or chicken. Ideal for a quick pick up and go lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This is a sweet little restaurant.  Very homey, quick service, good food.  Their menu is pretty standard as far as Thai food goes.  They have really fresh tasting veggies.  

Part way through my meal I started feeling funky and asked if they use MSG.  They do.  It makes me feel off and of course I should have thought to ask when ordering but forgot to.  Why do places have to load their food with it?

The space is tiny.  And, some of the tables have wood benches to sit on that look particularly uncomfortable.  This does not seem like the kind of place where you want to linger with friends but more so a good take out option or a quicker lunch or dinner.  

This place is not bad, but I will stick with Thai Cuisine where they don't use MSG and the food is great."}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday night around 7, no wait at all for a table of 4. Cozy small byob place with a few tables outside and the food was everything I expect from fresh Thai. Service was attentive and the food came out very quickly. We had the red curry, green curry, pineapple curry, and pumpkin curry. All were slight different and all were delicious, I couldn't choose a favorite. We also ordered the fried rice to share which was massive, we took most of it home!"}
{"text":"The Tom Kha soup was the BEST I've ever had! 

Great little BYOB place."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh especially when you compare it to Nicky's.  We are from out of town and I have eaten Thai all over the world and this place is great, hands down.  The Thai ice tea, pad thai and especially the tom yum noodle soup is outstanding.  The pumpkin curry that everyone raves about is so-so.  It is pricey for Thai food but worth it for the experience.  I'd go again and again.  Must enjoy!"}
{"text":"Wow. This was my first time trying this place after being in Pittsburgh for over nine years. Don't let that happen to you. The curry noodle dishes and soups were amazing. The prices, very reasonable. The atmosphere was very casual yet sort of romantic. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in Pittsburgh! It's the whole package fast friendly service, good fair prices, and delicious food. I like this place a lot and really enjoy going with friends when I'm in the city! My favorite is the panang curry with tofu, spicy and the pad see ew with tofu, also spicy! I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious so try them out!"}
{"text":"Having tried almost all the Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, this was one of the few left on our list. The food was worthy of 4 stars - we had Tom yam and Tom kha soups, both very tasty and well done - possibly worthy of 4.5 stars! Our entrees were Kao soy noodles and chilli shrimp with rice. Both tasted great! But the chilli shrimp was $14 and only came with 6 regular sized shrimp and a ton of vegetables. A bit too few for the price. The Kao Soy had a generous serving of pork. 

My 3 star review is based on the service we received. While it wasn't bad, our server, a young girl, was not very warm or pleasant, which made the atmosphere that night feel very cold. I just felt very uneasy with the service we received - or waitress was also more interested in sitting down and playing with her phone right in front of the entrance rather than putting a smile on her face.

Overall, food is good, but I have had better overall experiences at other Thai restaurants in Burgh."}
{"text":"It was a complete accident that I ended up here for a Saturday lunch, but I'm so happy it did happen. 

This restaurant is a super small hidden gem that features Thai food. Everything on the menu looked so fresh and delicious. I ended up settling on the vegetable Thai noodle soup. This bowl was so large I barely made a dent in it and had a full meal the next day too. The broth was the most flavorful not too salty broth I have ever had. The vegetables were so fresh and delicious and the noodles were down right divine. My boyfriend even agreed that he was jealous of my order because it was so dang good. I also had a sip of the Thai iced coffee which was super sweet. It's not necessarily my drink of choice but it's very authentic.

I can't wait to stop by again and try their curry."}
{"text":"Exceptional food at great prices....service is very good, but atmosphere/ambience is average. Eaten here 10 times and everything is good...pork dumplings awesome!!!"}
{"text":"All Thai waitress and they are really nice. Great Thai food!!
I had mango curry and coconut milk, both of them are delicious!!"}
{"text":"I almost feel bad being the contrarian. Almost.

The khao soi here (a dish I generally adore) was so incredibly bland and flavorless, I briefly panicked and thought I had showed up at the wrong restaurant. It could be because I have a very close attachment to the idea of what khao soi should taste like. It could even be because my taste buds are dysfunctional and cannot perceive more subtle flavors (although I doubt this). It may just have been an off night for the restaurant. Whatever the reason, I did not enjoy my experience here as much as others have."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service, relatively low price. This cozy restaurant has an intimate feel and the accompanying limited seating. The food is consistently good and prepared to requested spiciness."}
{"text":"We called ahead to order take out, and the restaurant said it would take approximately 20 minutes, which it actually did. So when we arrived, the food was ready to go.

I ordered the beef pad see ew, which was great. The sauce was a semi-sweet soy sauce and the noodles weren't too dry or too sticky. However, the beef itself was a bit dry, so I would recommend ordering some other type of protein. My brother ordered pad kee mow, also known as drunken noodles, which was delicious. He ordered a 3, so it was a little bit spicy, but not unbearable. I personally liked the pad kee mow better.

The portion is pretty generous (we ordered dinner size), and the food is delicious. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"They took reservations which was nice especially given that it's a small space. I would certainly recommend reservations if you're going with the big party. The food is great. The spice level of 5 should suffice but if you want to add some kick to your food you should get 6-8. The service is good and prices are reasonable. The menu has a lot of good options. I wish they had more dessert options."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy and cute. It is right near Highland Park and there is outdoor seating for nice days! You can pick your level of spiciness from 1-10 and it can get pretty hot! The green curry is pretty standard as is the pad thai which are the dishes I tried, but many other options are available such as pumpkin curry and various fish dishes. There is also delivery and take out."}
{"text":"Great Thai place. This is a busy little restaurant tucked away in Highland Park. Very cute little neighborhood joint. Service is excellent. Our waitresses were courteous and attentive without being pushy.

On to the food - excellent Thai cuisine! We had the coconut curry chicken; the sauce was delicious and flavorful without being too heavy. Portion for the coconut chicken wasn't too large. The chicken pad thai however was a much bigger dish! Still also, a very good choice. Pad thai can be somewhat generic in its application but we both found it to be very tasty.

I can definitely see myself coming back here again. The prices were also very reasonable given the quality."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai in Pittsburgh. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they really over spiced my curry. I asked for level 2 and got at least a 6. The Tofu Paradise is amazing. The fresh rolls are refreshing.  I met my sister-in-law for an early dinner and we ended up sitting there talking for 3 hours. Not once did we feel pressured to leave."}
{"text":"Another great Thai restaurant in the Pittsburgh area, conveniently located in Highland Park. We had a Saturday lunch. Rebecca had Tom Yum Soup with chicken, and I had spicy noodles with napa cabbage, chicken, and basil leaf. Both were excellent with complex flavors, adequately spiced, and satisfying--on a par with Nicky's Thai Kitchen in Verona or the Green Mango restaurants in Edgewood and Homestead. 

Service was quick and efficient. I'd guess it might be difficult to get seated on some evenings, because there is not much seating. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm going to have to give this place 5 stars. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Smiling Banana Leaf.

Food - super flavorful, and piping hot when it arrives. I found myself drooling over half of the menu. A really great selection. The pineapple curry my friend had was spot on, the vegetarian spicy tom yum gai noodle soup was superb and my friend's shrimp special stirfry was super good. The fried calamari appetizer was a bit small, but it was clearly fresh and delicious. 
 
Prices - extremely reasonable. The three of us each had entrees and shared an app and it came to 50 bucks with tax and tip. Amazing!

Service - friendly, genuine, prompt, and yes, we had the lovely tall Thai woman/transgender waitress. Honestly, she is one of the loveliest people ever. We were seated and out in an hour. We werent' rushed and everything was timely. The place was absolutely packed, with only two waitresses. 

Ambiance - it is small (probably seats 30 max), and I don't think they take reservations, so get there at a decent time! The table layout make it not cramped at all though. It's not romantic and can get a tad noisy, so it's perfect for a friend gathering. 

Bonus! BYOB, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I have to give this place one more star than Bangkok Balcony.  I went to look for my Bangkok Balcony review, and realized that I had never written one.  Well....at least now you know how many stars Bangkok Balcony gets before I write a review!

I had tried to visit this place once before today, but when I called in to try to reserve a table for 5 at 7PM two hours before, they were booked until 930PM with no space even for walkins.  So, yes. MAKE A RESERVATION.  I made one more than a day in advance for 2 at 7:15PM on a thursday evening.  Parking was pretty easy; I found a number of free street side spots along Euclid Ave, north of Bryant St.  

The very first thing I noticed before I visited the restaurant was their marked difference in price.  For the same dishes, Smiling Banana Leaf had at least a 2-3 dollar price advantage on almost all the main dishes compared to those at Bangkok Balcony.  The only two things that were to be determined at dinnertime were quality and quantity.

We ordered and split a Som Tum (papaya salad) spiciness level 5, Red Curry with chicken spiciness level 5, and basil pork spiciness level 5.  The red curry was delicious: not too rich like some places make them (with regular coconut milk instead of low fat coconut milk), and just the right quantity. the papaya salad was actually perched upon a bed of greens, a change from the usual way I have it (without the bed of greens, obviously).  there was a tad bit too much dressing, which I will take a note of next time i order the dish, which was otherwise tasty.  lastly, the pork of the basil pork was slightly tough. the pork didn't seem very fresh or something, perhaps due to the fact that most people order chicken.  not sure though: i wouldn't deter anyone from trying it!

Cutting this review short, someone in my vicinity is complaining that i'm writing a novel. so...good thai iced tea! potent tea flavor without too much of that condensed milk mixed in (usually the point of failure in man other establishments).  In summary, I'll be coming here from now on.  Cheers for great Thai food in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Pittsburgh! I've never had a bad meal here. Their website for ordering takeout is super easy to use and so convenient!!"}
{"text":"Great thai food, a menu with a good selection of options. The tom yum was good, a bit too tangy for my taste, but my friends liked it a lot. The duck entree was very tasty! I got yellow curry with chicken and asked for a 9/10 spice (I love hot & spicy food). I would rate what they gave me at more of a 2/10, but oh well. The flavors were good, and the portions were perfect, with enough to bring home.

We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"My gf wanted Asian instead of BBQ, so I found this place with really good reviews. I was surprised how tiny it was inside, and it would be really cramped when it's full. Food was great, I had the pork dumplings and a couple orders of chicken satay. I forget what she had, except that she said it was pretty spicy. We both really enjoyed it though, and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm hardly an expert on Thai food (though quite by chance, this is my second visit to a Thai restaurant in a month) but we had a really positive experience at the Smiling Banana Leaf (including the outstanding service from the tall \"woman\" who is exceptionally friendly.  I had the duck noodle soup, my wife had the Chef's chicken special, and my son had the pumpkin curry, which was plenty spicy for me at number 5!  Everything was very tasty, well presented, and indeed, incredibly reasonable in price.  Dinner for three with tip for less than 40 bucks.  (We didn't do the BYOB thing, but it's definitely an option.)

As is often the case in Pittsburgh, we meandered through quite a few interesting neighborhoods en route, and I was a little leery when we pulled up to park.  But once inside, the place is modest, but nicely decorated.  Showing up after 5:00 on a Saturday night without a confirmed reservation seems like it would surely lead to disappointment!  

Still learning about the nuance of Thai cooking, but thinking this has set a nice baseline for our future exploration!"}
{"text":"Thinking about their pad thai is making me drool.  We got our food to go, but we finished it before we got home (and eating pad thai and driving is not easy -- that's why I pulled over).  I got a spice level of 7.  It was hot enough to warm the face but not be unbearable.  It was delicious."}
{"text":"Love this place. Best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Can't say much more than that, you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorites are the pineapple curry and the pad Thai."}
{"text":"The wait is not really worth the quality of the food. I've heard that it's the best Thai food place in Pittsburgh, but I would disagree. The food is just okay. The service is just okay. There's nothing special about this place. 

I had the pad kee mao and my friends had the Thai curry. They just tasted okay. I think they used too much fish sauce because we all had strange after tastes in our mouths after eating."}
{"text":"Very Small, kinda of hard to find, but oh so worth the trip.  Excellent service, and the food was incredible.  I had red curry, and I don't think I could have made a better choice.  Hubby had the mango tilipia and loved it. Sis could not stop raving about the Pad Thai, and mom was really happy with her duck dish. 

If we can find the place again, I do believe a repeat visit is in order.  All thumbs up, great job."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is just average. They are not bad but I think there are a lot of much better thai restaurants around Pittsburgh. Because Pittsburgh has so many thai restaurants to choose from there's much more competition to be the best restaurant. It also makes me a little more picky when critiquing a restaurant because there are so many good ones to choose from around the city. 
I started with the vegetarian spring rolls which I did not like at all. They were dry and tough and hardly any flavor. I also ordered the Tom Kha soup which was so good. And my entree was the mango tilapia which was decent but a tad too much sauce. 
I don't regret eating there however I don't think I'll bother going back."}
{"text":"We consider this one of the best Thai restaurants in town as we have been to almost every Thai restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. We are never disappointed when we go or when we get take-out.

We often order as an appetizer 'Tofu Paradise'  and split an entree of \"Pad See Ew\"  which are our favorites there.

Noodle Dishes: Excellent
Curry Dishes: Ok- too much liquid 
Atmosphere and Service: Great 
BYOB and Outdoor Seating: Nice extra"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh and I think I found it. My dish was delish. Not a single piece of rice left on my plate. Left with a smile and a very satisfied tummy. Will be back."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is the Cadillac of Thai food restaurants in Pittsburgh. There are a lot of Thai places in the Burgh, but this is as good as it gets. The place is tiny and it's a very intimate atmosphere with soft candlelight. It's a great place to take a date and it's BYOB. 

The food is fantastic. Consistently. Also, I like that they don't try to dumb down the spice level of their dishes. If you're averse to hot and spicy food, make sure that you tell them as you order your food. On a scale of 1-10... 

The place is within walking distance of my home and the staff always remembers my name. I am smitten with this place."}
{"text":"Came a couple of days ago for dinner. Brought my own drinks along (beer). 

The server was nice, food came out very quickly. It's a nice cozy restaurant, with plenty of outdoor seating. 

I had crab rangoon and spicy noodle tom yum with shrimp(requested as hot & spicy as possible). The appetizer was nice, and was served with what seemed to be a thin duck sauce. The \"spicy\" noodle tom yum was quite possibly the mildest dish I have ever eaten. It was not spicy in the slightest, which was very disappointing even after I had requested that. Otherwise there were a fair number of pieces of shrimp (6). 

For value, the crab rangoon was $6 which was not bad. The tom yum was $11 + $4(for the shrimp). I'm not sure how I feel about an additional $4 for shrimp, I know seafood is more expensive but eh, well I guess it is warranted. What I found odd was that if you wanted tofu or vegetable options it was $12 but chicken and pork are $11. I have never heard of the veggie options being more expensive than the meat. 

It was good, I would probably give it another shot for a take-out. Hopefully next time they will actually add some heat to the dishes I order!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to eat. Probably the best fusion food in Pittsburgh. 

A must try!"}
{"text":"What a find! I came here with friends for a late lunch and we were all blown away! The service was friendly and the food was amazing. Sadly the curries were non-vegetarian(curry usually has fish sauce or shrimp paste etc) but they even had a pumpkin curry which I would have loved to try! I ended up getting a spicy eggplant dish that was delicious. I can't wait to go back and take my husband. If you like Thai food this is probably the best in Pittsburgh. Also, the Thai iced tea is to die for."}
{"text":"I am so happy we tried a new Thai spot! SBL was delicious! We went on a Friday night and they had a crowd (we called ahead and made a reservation- I would highly recommend bc the restaurant is small). Pad See Ew is my go to for Thai food and their dish was perfect! The noodles, the sauce, the veggies were one of the best I have had in Pittsburgh. The service was friendly. It is BYOB, too! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We called and the answering  machine. Had nothing to say. We arrived at a time  open on their internet site. We arrived to find they are closed for remodeling.

Fuck em!

Can't they put a message on the phone? 

I'm going to Nicky's. 

Fuck smiling banana  leaf owners, they are sloppy and left a bad taste in my mouth.

I hear they  are closed for a poor health department rating"}
{"text":"I had chili shrimp. The food was ok, and not impressive enough for me to return. My friend had chicken friend rice, which was very large, yet quite heavy."}
{"text":"I love the food and the atmosphere. The mango curry is my favorite. I just think the service isn't fantastic and it's small and crowded. Might be better off getting food to go."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. The Tofu Paradise is aptly named.

Fresh spring rolls were not their strong suit, but Panang curry was the best I've had in years.

Only a few tables, but the small space is perfect for intimate dining."}
{"text":"I got the spicy green bean and it was absolutely delicious! I asked for a 9 on the spice level and it was very flavorful! I will be coming back very soon"}
{"text":"I've waited until I had been here a couple times before I ventured into this review. I have mixed feelings but not about the food. With one exception, all the food I've had here has been good. Really good. That exception was the calamari appetizer. That was just downright awful. \"Crispy calamari\" turned out to be 8 (I counted) small calamari rings that were deep fried beyond recognition and were impossible to bite through. Like bad onion rings. Just terrible! And for $6.50 it has to be the one item on the menu you absolutely must never order! Talk about a bad taste in my mouth! I'm willing to overlook them and just take it as a lesson learned.

The spring rolls are a delight, the pork ginger was spectacular with spice level right on, and seafood entrees are very good as well. Lunch size portions are sizable and a really good value not to mention super tasty. I'd give the food a solid 4 star rating.

The atmosphere, however, is abysmal. I'd give it 1 star. People tell you its small. That's an understatement. Small, crowded, uncomfortable. And in the winter, the front door opening and closing brings the temp inside down 5-10 degrees each time. BRRRR.  The setting is like someone set up tables in your grandma's living room and said, oh wait, we can add one or two more in here, you don't mind do you? - now sit down and enjoy! Sorry, that's not my idea of an ideal dining experience. There is no way you'd EVER get me here at a conventional dinner/lunch time nor on any weekend! It's bad at off peak times! So small and so uncomfortable it ruins everything! 

I consider Smiling Banana Leaf a take-out only place. The food is good and if I lived closer I'd have their number on speed dial. But don't invite me to dinner there. I won't go."}
{"text":"Delicious soup! It was hot, sweet, and spicy with plenty of fresh veggies. I would definitely go back and try another dish."}
{"text":"Really good Thai iced tea!! ...heads up, if you ask for a level 3 spice it's still going to be pretty darn spicy"}
{"text":"I've tried every Thai spot in Pittsburgh, and SBL is always # 1 in my opinion. The atmosphere is nice and cozy, BYOB and always quick and delicious. I usually get the fried rice, see ew, or a curry dish. I highly recommend this over ANY other Thai place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I did my yelp research before ordering. Cautiously I said \"mild\" because the reviews come up warning this place can be very hot. True. The mild has a kick so the medium might blow your head off. Pumpkin curry is good but am a little curious about the diced carrot and pea mixture in there. I am guessing since the dice on the carrot was perfect and exact that this was from a frozen bag mix which upsets me. The curry fried rice had veges in it though that looked fresh and cut by a human so then I felt relief. My daughter tried the duck curry and said the duck was fattier than she is used to so I am not sure how to rate it."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5. My dining companion and I went there at around dinner time and got take out because the restaurant was filled.  They took about 25 minutes to fix the meal, which I guess isn't too bad.  We got the Moo Yang, the ginger with beef, and the green curry with tofu and vegetable. 

My favorite was the green curry. It created a warm fuzzy feeling in my stomach, though I think for the price, they were a bit stingy with the tofu/veggies? The Moo Yang (pork with some salad) was good but a bit too salty for me.  I wasn't a fan of the Ginger, but maybe it just wasn't complementary with the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here sometimes and always have a great time. The servers and the food are both wonderful each and every time. Since it's BYOB, we usually bring wine or some nice beer and try not to order everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Will always be my first favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh (tied with Nicky's Thai Kitchen downtown). 

They have the best green curry and basil stir fry. Green curry noodle soup is delicious :)"}
{"text":"Love the food... The servers are friendly and the service was pretty good. The place is small and the location is somewhat odd. But nevertheless, a highly recommended place if you're in search of a great thai cuisine. They also have a limited outdoor seating which could use a bit of TLC.

Plus, it's BYOB :)"}
{"text":"We went at about 6:20 pm on a Friday and just barely got a table. This place gets packed! I got the pumpkin curry, which was delicious. My husband had pad thai, which was just okay. I got the impression that this place is a good staple for take-out. It's far too busy and cramped for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"In a word... YUM!  I used to think that Nicky's Thai Kitchen was the only place for good Thai food, and that I would not even explore other options after a few disappointing experiences elsewhere.  That is until I came here.  It never disappoints!  

Best Shrimp Pad Thai ever,  yummy dumplings,  yummy spring rolls, and their Spicy Noodle is to die for.  BYOB makes it even better.  Great spot for a date, a small get together.  Reservations definitely recommended on the weekend!"}
{"text":"not a big fun of Thai food. honestly speaking, the food i tried was Horrible. i have been to a couple of Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. This is definitely the least worth-to-try one. Would never visitt again guess."}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, I had something important to do in the afternoon and didn't want to deal with the variable of spicy food from an unknown restaurant, so I ordered a 6 on their scale of 1 to 10. It was more like a 1.

With that in mind, I ordered a 10 last night on the same dish. The waitress (not the happy tall one I like, the other one) insisted that it would be too spicy for me, so I said ok fine, 9. She didn't like that much either but whatever, I'm the one eating it, not her. My boyfriend stuck with a 10.

My food came and was tasty, but I would say spice level-wise it was a 2. My boyfriend's was a 2.5. So I guess unfortunately, this place suffers from the same affliction as all other Thai restaurants (besides the ones in Chicago): they cannot and WILL NOT make spicy food. I felt somewhat reverse-ethnically profiled (in terms of ability to handle spices of course). Please don't assume that because most of the other pale and pasty midwesterners order spicy and then complain when it comes out to them that it's too spicy, that this pale and pasty midwesterner will!"}
{"text":"Excellent and reasonably priced Thai food! This place is tucked away in a pretty unassuming location, but that only adds to the allure of the place as a hidden gem of Asian cuisine in Pittsburgh. I've heard that there are other great Thai places in the area, but I haven't tried them yet. For now, this place suits me just fine and serves dependably excellent and authentic Thai cuisine.

Definitely give their tom yum soup and curries a try!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that made it to the \"top 5 restaurants\" in pittsburgh on yelp, this place was a major let down. There is great Thai, and then there is just plain blah Thai.... Smiling banana leaf's food belongs to the later category. There was nothing really memorable or special that set this meal apart... What a disappointment!

For our meal we ordered their famed chicken pad thai, the fried rice & the red chili shrimp. None really good. If I absolutely HAD TO pick one I would say it was the fried rice (what a sad state of affair!)

The place isn't large, just a hole in the wall. So don't you dare come in with a big group to enjoy the food here!

Overall: I'm sure there are better options in Pittsburgh for thai food that would have deserved a spot on the top Pittsburgh restaurant lists over smiling banana leaf."}
{"text":"The dining room here is the definitely of cozy and eclectic.  Our table of 4 occupied a small nook by the window, and the vibe of the full restaurant was just very warm and welcoming.

The menu was the standard Americanized Thai fare, but that didn't stop me from enjoying everything we ordered.  We ordered the CRISPY PORK SPRING ROLL, CHICKEN SATAY, and STEAMED DUMPLINGS for the table.  The spring rolls and dumplings both had tasty, meaty fillings, and all 3 dishes came with nicely paired dipping sauces.  The satay was my least favorite dish--the chicken was a bit dry and the satay spices weren't terribly flavorful.  But the rest of my table had no complaints.

I ordered the TOM YUM SOUP and THAI BASIL stir fry, to which I added broccoli, while my fiancee had the PAD SEE EW.  My soup was delightfully spicy and sour and chock-full of mushrooms, and my basil dish was flavorful and plenty spicy for me as well (I asked for 9/10), not always an easy feat for this chili junkie.  And the bites I stole off my fiancee's plate were a perfect complement to my own dish--the eggs, veggies, and noodles were saucy and slightly sweet.  Our friends inhaled their GREEN CURRY and MASSAMAN CURRY bowls.  The portions were all sizable--our combined entree leftovers were another for another single portion meal.  DIBS."}
{"text":"This is two reviews in one: one for my dining experience, and one for a catering experience.

My dining experience:

This is a great place to bring a group because they take reservations and the food is very customizable. The decor is lovely, as well.  Thai food is a favorite with me, especially when the restaurant is friendly to vegetarians.

I had the tofu paradise and the pineapple fried rice (veg). We brought our own wine, and they were very helpful about keeping it chilled. The prices are great for the amount of food that you get.

My catering experience:

Yes, they cater! And yes, they deliver! I was very happy about this.

I ordered pad thai with tofu and the chicken panang curry. I had 60 people to feed, so I ordered a total of 60 dinner portions (30 of the tofu, 30 of the curry). This was waaaay too much food. You can get away with lunch portions and maybe even reducing the number of portions that you order.

The food was a big hit, especially since they brought a spice mix on the side so that people could customize their food. The price was the same as their in-house price, plus a discount for ordering above some amount. Overall it was around $10 per person, which is amazing for catering of such quality.

The food was on time and they helped me carry it in as well. Very great experience!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this might be the best Thai food in the city.

I just got done working a nightmarish shift at work, and decided to go with my coworker to get an early dinner.  I've been to this place before, and every time have had a pleasant experience.

This time was no exception.  I got the red curry with beef (spicy level 9), and started off with some calamari. After having a brief discussion with the...absent server, I managed to get my calamari out to the table.  The calamari was great as always.  Not overly breaded, great soft texture, and the sweet chili sauce was a much better option than the typical marinara.

The curry took a little long getting out, but made up for it as I took the first bite.  The rice was a colorful blend of different grain rices, and there was a generous portion of curry.  The flavor was great, and it was almost as spicy as I would have wanted it.  Home run.

Now for the reason that put it short of five stars.  The service.  The server, who had some sort of European accent, was friendly, but seemed to be overwhelmed, which as a member of the service industry, I couldn't believe.  There was 3 tables other than myself in there, and he seemed pretty weeded.  My calamari came up after my curry, but he was apologetic, and get them out in a timely fashion, and kept my food hot in the back while me and my coworker ate our appetizer.  My water glass was empty within 5 minutes of sitting down, and remained empty until I was halfway finished with my meal, which was the only thing that really bothered me about my meal.

All in all, regardless of the service, I would go to Smiling banana leaf whenever I'm craving Thai food.  The portions are large, the prices are fair, and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, read the reviews & knew it was a must during my trip. We had the fried spring rolls with shrimp...they were delicious. I had the Tom Kha soup with squid. The soup was creamy and well balanced. My beau had the Curry Fried Rice with chicken and added shrimp. He loved it! I took a bite & was sold. There is no denying the strong curry taste, but was not overpowering. I had the roast duck curry & it was FABULOUS! The mixture of spices with the pineapple was perfect. We got all dishes as a spice level of 6 which was perfect for us. We LOVE spicy foods, but any higher of a spice rating and would not have been able to enjoy the flavors."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall, with quite tasty Thai fare, the Smiling Banana Leaf is great if you are there during off hours but as it only has seating for approx. 15 patrons finding a seat can be a challenge."}
{"text":"I don't care much for Smiling Banana Leaf because although I ask every time which entrees can be made without fish sauce, shrimp paste, egg etc, I am offered many choices but the food always tastes like fish sauce anyway; either that or msg (admittedly, I confuse the two flavors, but I truly think in this case it's fish sauce, unless maybe it is msg that has so many people hooked on this place!). I also agree with Jarrett H. in that they seem to take you for a fool when ordering a high spice level, so they just serve everything U.K. style. In conclusion, I feel that the Smiling Banana Leaf does not practice respect for the customer's requests. Vegans and spicaholics beware."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Ran L. about the food here being just average for Thai.  I stopped by with a friend on Sat. evening to get take-out.  I ordered the pad see ew with shrimp (spice level: 4), and she ordered the ginger chicken (spice level: 3).  I'm not sure if they accidentally transposed the spice levels, but her food was so spicy it was inedible to both of us.  My food, on the other hand, had about the amount of spice that I like.

In addition to the shrimp, my pad see ew came with what appeared to be small pieces of chicken.  I was a bit surprised by the paucity of shrimp--but then again, I'm not super-familiar with this dish, so they could just be an add-on.  The flavor was okay, but didn't wow me.  The vegetables were well-cooked and not limp, which was nice.  The two dishes came with a side of rice, though it was unclear which dish it went with, which we ended up splitting.  Because of the inedibility of the ginger chicken, my friend and I ended up splitting the pad see ew--fortunately, there was enough to do that.

I should mention that my friend, who lives in Morningside, is a frequent customer of SBL, and has ordered the ginger chicken (in addition to other dishes) many times before.  As such, she was surprised at the inconsistency in the spice.  One level up shouldn't have been that much hotter!

I tried the ginger chicken and didn't care for the dish's flavor, so when my friend offered the rest of it to me, I declined.  I did take the rest of the pad see ew and finished it tonight, but was debating not doing so.  Ultimately, a combination of hunger and being out late got the best of me, though.  With so many other great Thai options in PGH (like Nicky's, my fav), I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, based on my experience and the extremely small seating area (it really is tiny!)."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to SBL forever. Like, FOREVER. I just for some reason never did. Maybe I was just expecting too much but I was a little let down. This is not the best Thai food in Pittsburgh, oh no. It's not terrible (would rather eat here than Thai Place) but not stellar either.

I started with fresh spring rolls, like I do at every Southeast Asian restaurant. They were out of shrimp so I got tofu. They were okay, but not enough Thai basil, and I didn't like that they cut them into pieces for you. The dipping sauce was good though.

The pineapple curry had a great flavor but not spicy enough for me. My major complaint with it though was the meat was just not good. The pieces of beef were small and had a rubbery texture. I'm not expecting filet mignon in my curry, but this was pretty bad. Some of my friends' dishes that I sampled were better, particularly the noodle dishes. But my curry was not up to par, and since I order curry about half the time I eat Thai, this is a matter of importance.

I like the BYOB and the atmosphere is cute, but I'll stick with Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Since moving to Pittsburgh, I have heard that this was THE place to come for Thai food.  It is out of the way so it took until yesterday to finally try it after a visit to the zoo.

Thankfully we were early enough that there was no wait because the dining room is so tiny.  I think there may have been about five or six tables total.  Where we were seated was bench seating on one side and metal chairs on the other.  They each had cushions but weren't exactly comfortable.  

The server seemed a bit frazzled which didn't make sense because there was only on other table that was occupied.  When we had questions on the menu, they weren't sure and had to keep coming back with the information.  That being said, they were willing to get the information and not be rude about it or write our questions off.

We started with a Thom Kha soup and peanut satay.  The soup was a hit.  A perfect blend of sweet coconut and spice.  It was LOADED with vegetables.  Almost too many for the fairly small bowl.  Friends wanted to order the fresh roll of the day but apparently they hadn't made them yet (even though it was after 5:00).

My husband ordered the pad kee mao and although he enjoyed it, said he has had much better elsewhere.  He had asked for a spice level of 9 and it was more like a 4 or a 5 which was disappointing to him.  

I ordered the mango curry with tofu with a spice level of 5.  We wonder if they accidently switched the spice levels of our dishes because it had a crazy kick.  It was extremely tasty, though.

Our friends ordered entrees with brown rice and both came out with white rice.  When more rice was brought out, even though they both ordered the same rice, it was different.  Not sure why, but they both enjoyed it.

Overall, I really enjoyed my dining experience here and would be back more often if it was closer to the areas that we tend to frequent."}
{"text":"Best green curry I've had in the city. Portion size good for weight conscious people. Simply delicious Thai food!! Wish they had bigger seating area."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this place is so far out, because Smiling Banana Leaf is definitely one of the better Thai places in Pittsburgh. The selection is pretty good, and they have both lunch (weekday) and dinner portions for most of their curries, noodles, and specials. Everything sounds good, so it is often hard to choose what to eat!

Personally, I've found the pad see ew and green curry to be very good. The noodles in the pad see ew are addicting, while the curry has just the right amount of flavor. The one time we tried the pad thai, we thought it was okay but probably not as good as that of Thai Gourmet. 

In any case, those are just some of the more common things, so we are hoping to try other more unique dishes in future visits. One thing to keep in mind is that place is a bit small, and the seating arrangement while interesting is a bit awkward with unconventional chairs and weird pillows on a hard bench."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf, I love your food, but you won't get your 4 stars back until you give me the spiciness level I ask for. I know an '11' can beat out 'medium' store-bought salsa, I know it can. 

It seems like every time I go, I order a higher level of spice, and the dishes get milder."}
{"text":"Place is cozy and seats 25 people. They have a typical thai menu and serve lunch and dinner. Lunch times (and prices!) end at 3pm on weekdays, dinner is all day Saturday and Sunday. Dinner portion was hefty and we both ended up taking home a bit of our meals. 

Pumpkin curry is one of the best I've had and my friend kept trying to eat mine all night. Sauce is thick and delicious. Spicy ratings are from 1-10. I like mild spice and got a 3, definitely on the higher side of a 3 but oh so delicious. We didn't take advantage of it, but it's BYOB.

Great place to go to after the zoo - 5 mins away and a great place to relax."}
{"text":"A great little place. The food is really quite excellent...try the fish with mango and the spicy green beans. Have eaten in and taken out and the food is very consistent and always really good. Not many seats in the restaurant and they seem to do a fair amount of take out business. It's a regular for me and very recommended"}
{"text":"Am I missing something? From all of the reviews, I made the hike all the way up to Smiling Banana Leaf from the South Hills.  I didn't hate anything I had, I was just expecting something more exciting.  It just seemed to mesh in with all of the other thai places I have had before in the taste factor.  Not sure if it was worth the 40 minute drive."}
{"text":"If your sign says you're open til 9 then you're open til 9. Don't close your kitchen at 8:30 and shoo people away. Your customer focus has always been questionable and is getting worse.  This rating is because of your service, not your food, which I unfortunately love. Everyone else on the street is open til 10. Your loss."}
{"text":"Stopped here, for dinner on a Thursday night with a reservation. The place is quite small and gets really crowded, I saw a few people turning back since the wait was so long and hence a reservation is highly recommended. 
We ordered the crab rangoons as an appetizer, and Thai red curry and cashew stir fry for for the main portion. I would watch the spice level here definitely and order a level lower. I usually get a 7 in Thai restaurants, but my dish turned out more spicy than my liking. That being said the food was extremely delicious. The cashew stir fry was so flavorful and heavenly. The red curry was delicious too. The crab rangoons were good as well.
Overall a pleasant and delicious dinner, and we will come back to explore other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my wife and two boys last night.  Although the description says that this place is not good for kids, there were many kids both young and old there last night.  I did not find any reason not to bring the kids here other than my own peace of mind.  The place is small so a reservation is recommended.  The menu has lots of different options.  We orderedtwo appetizers:  the chicken satay and fried spring rolls.  The satay was excellent.  It appeared to have an egg coating, and was very moist.  The peanut and cucumber sauces were both very good.  The spring rolls were a little too doughy and did not have a lot of chicken in them.  I would have preferred the shrimp or veggie; but sometimes you have to compromise with the rest of the family.  

For dinner I had the Spicy Noodle Tom Yum Soup (spice level 5) with shrimp and veggies.  Sweet and spicy with rice noodles done right. I would have preferred more noodles than what was included.  The shrimp were so so.  I am getting tired of the small imported farm-raised shrimp as they ususally don't have much flavor.  Lots of fresh veggies.  

My wife had the pad thai noodles with chicken, which she enjoyed.  I tasted it and the peanut sauce was really flavorful.  My boys both got chicken dishes, which were both very good, as well.  

The place is BYOB and the restaurant provided us with nice wine glasses.  I don't they even charged us a corckage fee.  

The place was hopping by the time we left.  There were two staff serving food and taking orders; they were very helpful is helping us decide what to get, and they managed to heep up with the tables despite how busy they were.  I will definitely come here again to try some new dishes."}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant with friends before a friend left to return to Florida. I heard great things and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the glass noddole salad and the green curry. The glass noddole salad was a honestly a meal in itself. The green curry was very tasty. I ordered everything at a level 5. I like spicy food and it was a good level.

If you want to come and sit down, you should call and make a reservation. The seating area is very small."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent service. 

I ordered take-out from here on a weeknight. Not only was the food amazing (pad kee mao w/ veggies and tofu), but they made no mistakes in taking down nor executing the order, which is really important for carry-out! 

Highly recommend. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 3.5 stars, but 3 will do. I called in for a reservation and when I arrived, still had to wait about 30 minutes and felt I was being rushed out. Not by the servers, but the place is so small that the people waiting kept poking their heads around the corner to see how much food I had left. 

The food was delicious though. I ordered the Pad See Ew with beef and didn't realize it was an extra FOUR DOLLARS for beef!! I've seen it be the same price as chicken, or MAYBE an extra two dollars...but four dollars...DAMN! and there wasn't even that much of it. So I was kind of mad about that part. 

Also got the tofu paradise and the pork spring rolls - both which were fantastic. Will definitely return, but probably to get take out as the place is way too small."}
{"text":"The food was really good but never have I ever experienced such bad customer service. The manager/owner/or some lady who seems in charge was extremely rude because I was ten minutes late to my reservation. I completely understand the issue of being late and I apologies; however, the lady was not nice. The waitress was nice, but she was not very attentive. The food took a long time to come out and items were forgotten. When we got our check, the owner threw the check at us, told us she wouldn't split it, and already added gratuity for our table of 5. I don't mind restaurants that have these policies, but (1) I don't think this restaurant had the policy and I just think the lady was being rude (2) they should be up front with the policy if the policy exists. The food isn't worth poor service and I can get better food elsewhere. Plus, the restaurant is tiny and crowded."}
{"text":"Great seafood pad thai. I also go for the 8~10 on the spiciness level and it's perfect. 
They also deliver!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! My girlfriend and I are big fans of Thai food, and this place is our favorite out of all the other restaurants we've been to. pineapple curry with chicken is phenomenal same goes for the mango and shrimp."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is so good. I've came here on multiple occasions and had a delicious meal, no matter what I got.  Keep in mind that the seating is pretty limited and if you want to go there on a Saturday night or something, a reservation would be a good choice.  

I've had Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, and Rad Na, all of which were great.  They tasted even better than I expected them to and the level of spice was as I asked for.  If you come during lunch time, the prices can't be beat.  The lunch portions are enough to fill me up and it costs less than $10!  Also, the Thai Iced Tea is always a great addition to the meal.

All their desserts are also super yummy. I've had them all but the sweet mango with sticky rice usually wins for me.  The mango with the rice is a great finisher to the meal.  Fried Smiling Banana is also something I'd definitely say to try if you've never tried it before."}
{"text":"Food is great but the new waiters are a total joke. Two young guys who are either overwhelmed or plain incompetent. Would love to see if others start commenting on this too. For example, bringing us waters when we already have water, and then just leaving the waters on our table anyway. Or how about giving not checking in on us for 40 minutes while we wonder where the food is? There used to be a man (who later transformed into a lady) who was kick ass. Epitomized Thai hospitality to me, actually. Bring her back PLEASE. Watching the new front staff is like watching a bad comedy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Smiling Banana Leaf on a tuesday for dinner. We knew this place was BYOB so we took a bottle of wine with us. The very friendly hostess/owner sited us and brought us actual wine glasses (you'd be surprised what some places that offer BYOB will offer to drink from). 
We had three appetizers: Thai Samosas, Chicken Stay and Tofu Paradise. Then my husband had the Seafood Pad Thai and I had the Chef's Specials: Prik Poa Talay. The food had a lot of flavor, fresh and crunchy veggies, spicy to your taste.
The restaurant is small, with only 24 seats. From the outside you wouldn't imagine the warmth of the dinning room; there are pillows on the seats up against the wall, candles lit on every table and a beautiful mural on the ceiling. 
Finally I have to agree with everyone that the Smiling Banana Leaf has great service, great food and no corkage fee. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf! This small but amazing Thai restaurant is tucked away in Highland Park, which is hard to get to without a car.  As a result, I haven't heard of this place from any of my college friends.  Rather, it was a graduate student who told my friend about the place, and so two nights ago we went to have dinner there.

The restaurant was very small, but thankfully not very crowded like Point Brugge Cafe.  Their menu included noodles, fried rice, curries, and so on.  Both me and my friend got the red curry.  It comes with a bowl of rice.  Apparently they also had purple glutinous rice (which I love) but we didn't get it because I didn't know about it until the customers beside us ordered it.  The next time I go I'm gonna order that =X

They allowed us to choose spiciness, from 1-10.  I of course wanted a 10 and it wasn't that spicy at all.  They definitely gave a lot of curry.  My friend easily ate 2 bowls of rice for the amount of curry they gave.  It was very, very good.  I'm not sure if I like the bamboo in it though.  It was kind of over cooked (probably because it was canned bamboo or something), and the peas and carrots made it seem like they used some frozen vegetable blend, which didn't go well with the curry.  But the pork soaked up the smell of the spices really well, and overall the curry was just really amazing with the rice.  I can't wait to come back again and to try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"This is the first of my 'bookmarked' places that I made an effort to try out, and I LOVED IT!  A cute little unassuming place in Highland Park with friendly and fast service.  My friend and I shared a bunch of appetizers and each got a soup.  Variety is the spice of life, after all.  I wanted to try everything.

The fried spring rolls (vegetable) were very very good.  I think the dumplings (steamed) were probably some of the best I've ever had.  The Moo Yang beef was also very good (I love sticky rice!).  I got the tom kha soup, which is my absolute favorite at Lulu's noodles in Oakland.  This tom kha was thicker, perhaps made with a heavier coconut milk.  There were also inedible leaves in the soup, but I didn't mind picking them out too much since the soup was delicious.  It's much richer and sweeter than Lulu's (which is more brothier and has a nice spice to it), but I'd say just as delicious.  I still prefer Lulu's because the heavier/richer soup left me not really wanting to eat the last few bites because I was full/overwhelmed by the flavor.    

I highly recommend this place.  Not too expensive, free parking.  It's small though.  We were there at 5:30 on a weeknight, but I can easily see this place filling up fast on a weekend."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with friends for some delicious Thai food. The restaurant is on the smaller end but I've always come at an off hour, and even if there were other customers, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes. It might be a different story during the more popular hours (dinner time), so make a reservation! 

I get a spice level of 7/10. It has a good kick but not to the point where I'm sweating. So I would say it's a comfortable level for those who enjoy spicy foods!

What I've ordered:
- Tom Yum Soup with Mushroom: Pretty good! It's a good portion size for an appetizer, so I would get this again if I'm in the mood for something spicy and sour!
- Koy Soy (yellow curry noodle): I get this almost every time I come here.  I can only manage to finish half and I take the rest for another meal. I love the curry that comes in this noodle and I eat it with some rice later for a second meal. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 
- Pad Thai: I'm pretty picky with Pad Thai because usually they don't stand out. But in my opinion, this place has the best Pad Thai. It's the perfect combo of sweet and savory! ALSO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
- Mango Sticky Rice: They served this to me with slightly warmed sticky rice and it was life changing. It is certainly more smoother and creamier when served warm than with cold rice!! Best Thai dessert!

Highlights:
- excellent quality food
- addictively tasty
- good portion sizes
- reasonable prices!
- friendly, responsive service
- outside seating for warmer weather.

For these reasons, this is my favorite Thai place (:"}
{"text":"This is a small, cozy Thai restaurant in the Highland Park area. The dishes are delicious. I highly recommend the Thai samosas. Ditto the basil dish and the Tom Kha soup with coconut milk. Bring your own alcohol; the waitstaff will serve and they do not charge a corkage fee. 

We felt the spice levels were not consistent. A 7-hot dish A was much milder than a 5-hot dish B.  Maybe it was so only when we went...

The pumpkin curry did not taste much like pumpkin. Not a big deal since it was still very good. 

Would definitely go there again..."}
{"text":"First, let me say the rating is not based on the quality of food. The quality of food is actually excellent. The poor rating is based on the terrible customer service my friends and I received for the 2nd time. My friends and I went here the day after Christmas for some quality Thai food and to let another one of our friends experience Thai food for the 1st time. Upon arrival, the restaurant was filled to capacity with only outside seating available. My friends and I decided to wait since we really had our hearts set on eating here. While waiting for about 10 minutes, the host told us we should be seated shortly since another table was becoming available. A couple minutes later, I noticed the server seated a family at the table that was supposed to be for my friends and I. So I politely said, \"excuse me, the host just told us we were going to be seated at the table.\" He snarled back with irritation in his voice that the host isn't the server and doesn't know what she is doing. He moved the family together so they can be seated at 1 table versus being separated, etc. He said a little bit more but I cannot remember exactly verbatim but nonetheless his tone and body language were uncalled for. All the host could say was she is sorry and she is not the server. 

This is the 2nd time I have experience rude service from the same server. The first time I complained to manager and still he walks around with the same negative attitude and horrible customer service as before. Due to this 2nd encounter, we will not be coming back to Smiling Banana Leaf. Good food but horrible service. They will not get another dime from me or my friends!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to the Smiling Banana for lunch! What a great little joint! I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Special. They asked how hot I want it. I told the a 7 and the hit it right on. It was delicious. Perfectly cooked with a tone of flavor! I got Crab Rangoon. Very flavorful. Light and crispy out side. I would have to say the best crab Rangoon I have had. I also got the pumpkin custard. One of the absolute best deserts I have ever had!!!
My buddy got fried and steamed pork dumplings. I had one of each. Spot on! 
Cashew Stir Fry. He said it was phenomenal! Nice and crispy vegetables and great great flavor !
Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious thai food in a cute, quaint location! 

Our server was hilarious and walked us through the whole menu. She gave us background information on the owners and the chef and told us the #1 rule is: don't ask the cook for her curry recipes. 

That being said, the curries were amazing. The green papaya salad was phenomenal and the desert was the perfect finish. 

We both really like spicy food and ordered a 6/10 for everything. We possibly could have gone a little spicier, but a 6 provided a little heat with every bite.

Street parking available near the restaurant. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yum. Smiling Banana was the perfect blend of spicy delicious food, cute atmosphere, and ideal location. We drove out to Highland Park to visit this little gem on a referral from a friend and we were not disappointed.  
The interior is very nicely decorated although would not accommodate a large group. The patio on our random 80 degree October days is also perched nicely in a cute neighborhood. I had the Veggie Pad See Ew, delicious! The hub had Panang Curry, which left a little to be desired. We also had the calamari which was pretty good also!
Overall, I would say stick with traditional thai noodle dishes-but we left pretty satisfied.

Pros: Pad See Ew, Service, Location (walk to Park Brugge for a beer after!), Decor
Cons: Watery Panang Curry"}
{"text":"I came here once but didn't go in because my friend persuaded me to try another restaurant. \"Big mistake, Big, Huge\"

Today my office got take out and we ordered from the Smiling Banana. Great menu selection all my favorites were there Pumpkin Curry, Pineapple Curry, Spicy Green bean...on and on I want to try everything on the menu. I had given up on finding a Pad Thai that I liked in the burgh; one of the girls who is a Thai Nazi said I should give it a try! 

Here is my review. I had the Veggie Pad Thai heat #3. I was slammed at work so had one taste, ran out of the room, turned around came back in. Took 2 big bites and \"mmmm'ed\"  Left the room to tell the girl that she was right. Best Pad Thai I have had in forever, or whatever I mumbled. Back into the room for one last bite. Worked for a couple hours busy. Had most of it left and thought it would be dinner. By the time 4pm rolled around my Pad Thai was finito and I want to order more tomorrow. Scratch that...right now!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, food and atmosphere! I am picky about my thai, and I give this place a thumbs up. We had to push back a reservation - twice - and they were very accomodating. We were seated within 5 minutes of arrival (and the place is very small). The food is flavorful, and the spiciness is at your discretion. Our wattress was very pleasant and friendly. Overall this was a wonderful experience - you MUST check it out if you're in Pittsburgh!

OH and it is BYOB, so drink up!"}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is Delicious! Red Curry Noodles, Pumpkin Curry with Tofu, Mango Curry with vegetables, & Spicy Green Beans all are Fantastic! When I get back into town this will be a definite stop!!!"}
{"text":"I showed up Saturday night with the GF, and there seemed to only be three staff total, what looked like the owner and two waitresses. Between them, they were cleaning, taking orders (including takeout orders), delivering food... the whole gauntlet. As a result, here's what our night approximately looked like:

7:45 - Arrive at restaurant
7:50 - Table opens up
8:05 - Get seated at table
8:25 - Take order
8:35 - Appetizer arrives
8:50 - Entree arrives
9:10 - Finish meal, pay at counter because we didn't want to wait for the check

I realize that this is a small independent restaurant, but c'mon, an hour from when a table opens up to when the entree arrives? I don't think it would kill them to hire an additional waitress.

So despite this pretty major gripe, Smiling Banana Leaf still gets a 3 because the food was quite good, and inexpensive to boot. We ordered the as entrees the duck curry and tofu eggplant basil. The flavors for both were excellent, bright but well-balanced, although the tofu eggplant basil needed more eggplant. 

Minus the whole time issue, I would give SBL a 4.5 (5 if the eggplant dish had more eggplant), but I just can't overlook waiting 15-20 minutes just to place your order, and the overall slowness. Sorry."}
{"text":"I took a leap of yelp on this place and I was not disappointed. This place is delish! After reading so many positive reviews I had this place on my list to try and I'm glad I was able to make it there for lunch today. I had never been to the area before but it was quite easy to get to from Shadyside (where I live). 

There is a small parking lot where you can park and when I went there was plenty of spaces left. The restaurant is small inside but is very well decorated - loved the ambiance. 

I ordered the Tom Kha soup and the Spicy Noodles - OMG they were sooooo good. I thought the spicy noodles were the best that I've ever had. I love the classic spicy basil noodle dish that you see at most Thai restaurants but I've always had complaints about the ones I've tried in the past - they were either not spicy enough or the chicken was dry or there wasn't enough sauce. But at Smiles - it was perfection - there was tender pieces of chicken, it was spicy (as it should be) and sauce covered each noodle! 

I highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back there again. It's such a gem of a place!"}
{"text":"I consider myself somewhat of a Thai food connoisseur and can genuinely say that this is the best I've ever had.  

The restaurant itself is very small, probably no more than 12' x 20', and is somewhat hidden away, but the service is superb--punctual yet not obtrusive--and the ambiance delightful.  It's low lit, but not irritatingly so, and the only real complaint I have is that the tables are a bit close together due to it's small size, making it ideal for a fun night out with friends as opposed to a private and quiet gathering.  And given the limited seating you'll definitely want reservations.

We started out with the fresh rolls, the best I've ever had, and followed up with entrees of pad thai, pineapple chicken fried rice, cashew pork and pumpkin chicken curry.  The presentation was beautiful but it should be noted that the entrees come as individual servings, not necessarily for sharing as is common to some Thai restaurants, so it's a good idea to order perhaps one or two more things on the menu if you plan to share amongst yourselves, as we did.  The pad thai was not at all greasy, a first for me, and all ingredients used were fresh and high quality.  Surprisingly, my very favorite was the pineapple fried rice.  I'm not sure what spices were used but it was phenomenal and unique.  

My conclusion is that you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I'll definitely be a repeat customer and can't wait to try out more of their exceptional food."}
{"text":"Very cool minimalist interior. Close quarters but still comfortable. Pleasant staff and incredibly fast service. Good prices. The best part is the food. I had the red curry noodles and it was PERFECT. I'm always on the lookout for my new favorite Thai restaurant and I may have just found out."}
{"text":"The place is decorated nice and its clean! lol The food is really good! I love spicy food but don't usually find restaurant food that spicy. Smiling banana leaf is an exception!! My husband loves the pad thai on a level 10 spicy but I can only take level 8. The spicy green beans with chicken is my favorite dish (level 8). Yesterday, I tried it with pork and it was an epic fail! The pork was really chewy. I like my meat (except for bacon) very well done. The first time my husband and I ate there we actually dined in which was a big mistake! My friend told me it was intimate but she should have told me it was a crack in the wall (not a hole but a tiny crack). There was only one waitress/hostess for the WHOLE restaurant! Be prepared to be thirsty because it might take a while to get a refill. The seats are very uncomfortable! I felt like I was back in high school sitting on the bleachers with a numb butt. The waitress was nice but she didn't know BASIC restaurant etiquette. I asked for a straw and chopsticks and she gave me both of them unwrapped with her hands all over it! Gross! Keep in mind she is a waitress/hostess so she was touching money,the cash register, menus, and 5 millions other things... okay maybe I'm a bit of a germophob 


OH and how can I forget... the bathroom!! The whole time I was hoping and praying that no one would go to the bathroom and do number 2. The whole restaurant would smell it... yes, the place is that small. 

Things to take from this review: 1. The food is great! 2. ALWAYS get the food to-go."}
{"text":"1. Make a reservation! It's tiny. Maybe seats about 30 people at a time. We went on a Thursday night and it was full. 

2. BYOB!!!!! 

3. Probably the best Tom Yum soup I've ever had!!!! So fresh and light. Got a spice level of 8 and could of gotten a 9 or 10. 

4. Went with the pumpkin curry. So good. Lots of chunks of pumpkin. I got a spice level 8, again could of got a 9 or 10. 

5. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the service and the food the last time I went here. The hostess wasn't friendly and seemed annoyed at us for coming in. As for the food, I asked for it to be mild, a 1 on the scale to be specific. Although I realize some spice is likely, but I could barely eat it! Also, there were frozen veggies in my dish, which was so disappointing considering it cost $12. I am struggling to understand what all the fuss is about."}
{"text":"For what this place is, it delivers. A group of co workers went here for a meal. We have had their delicious catering before (highly recommend) and thought it would be good to try the restaurant.

Note: byo beer. There is a place two blocks down where you can purchase some.

I ordered a vegetarian pineapple red curry - medium spicy- and it was great. I actually rarely see this on a menu so I felt like I got a special treat! They also really nailed the spice for everyone at the table- no one added more. 

Parking is plentiful. Casual and small."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place more stars based on the other reviews... but alas, just 3 stars.  I ordered the Thai samosas and spring rolls, and both were phenomenal!  
I then ordered the pad thai ( i know super generic, but I wanted to try it).  Let's just say, it was definitely lacking in the flavor department.

Service was great, but the place is rather small and kind of smelled a little funky in a sewage\"y\" way.  Nonetheless, if you can get a seat outside, it makes the experience a lot better.  

Overall, I'd go back, but only if I could eat outside."}
{"text":"This place is consistently delicious, and the waitress I always seem to get is adorable. I usually get the same thing, so I can't tell if she actually thinks I'm a genius for ordering my usual (tom yum, glass noodle salad, duck and pineapple curry) or if she does that for everyone. Don't really care, because it's adorable.

I also appreciate that it is possible for me to order something so spicy I can hardly stand it. I love spicy, but the most I can get here is a 7. If you're part asbestos, go for an 8. If you're suicidal, get a 10. 

The only negative comment I have is that because the place is so small, you can sometimes feel as though you're eating with the people at another table. Usually, this isn't a big deal, but on one occasion a family's three ill-behaved children all but ruined our night. 

Food: excellent
Service: great
Ambiance: cute, but crowded
Other people's kids: deserve takeout at best"}
{"text":"Another great find thanks to Yelp. We were driving from Ohio to DC and stopped here for dinner along the way. I'm glad we made a reservation because the place was packed on a Friday night. The service was prompt and the food was delightful. I think the spice level was accurate. I asked for a \"level 7\" (out of 10) red curry and it was perfectly spicy and made my eyes water - just the way I like it!"}
{"text":"Quaint and charming Thai restaurant. A real asset to the Highland Park neighborhood. Try the som tum."}
{"text":"I got takeout for dinner from here this past Sunday with a dining companion.  Since we got there a bit early to pick up our food I was able to look around a bit while waiting.  The restaurant itself is quite small and I counter ~25 seats in the whole place.  It does have a cheery feel with yellow walls and some flowers that looked real from where I was at.

For my dinner I decided upon having the chicken red curry at a level 10 spice while my dining companion had the chicken pad Thai.  There was an ample amount of food as I got a large portion of curry as well as a big side of rice.  The food itself was really good, better than most Thai that I have had in Pittsburgh.  My curry was spicy but not overly so and had a good mixture of all of the ingredients inside of it.  My dining companion also commented that she really enjoyed the Pad Thai.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely eat here again.  The food was good and I would like to actually sit in the restaurant and eat as it is a BYOB.  Of course when I do want to eat there I  would try to get reservations since the restaurant is so small."}
{"text":"Terrible service decent food. I know nothing about Thai food so when I asked the middle aged waitress some general questions she looked at me like I was stupid and told me that I was confusing her when I said I don't want the fat noodles I want the skinny noodles. Then when my food arrived I got the fat noodles. I normally tip 20-25% but she got 15% I will go back but if she is working I will turn around and walk out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been many times for dine-in and takeout, so I was really happy to learn that Smiling Banana Leaf caters! And delivers! It's nearly magical. 

I ordered three types of dishes for about 60 people, so I qualified for a discount. The cost ended up being ~$10/person, which obviously is outstanding for the quality. Also, the portions are huge and I ended up with lots of leftovers. (Just as good the next day!) 

My only gripe was that the food arrived without serving utensils but accompanied by a handful of napkins and around 10 sets of chopsticks. I was able to make it work because the meeting the meal was catered for happened to be in the same building as my office. But, this isn't always the case, and it did send me into a little bit of a panic. I didn't ask for serving utensils because in my experience with catering, they are always provided. So, I'm not sure if I didn't receive them because I didn't ask, they were forgotten, or that isn't an option. 

All in all, one of the better catering options in Pittsburgh. I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"What was I thinking? The food isn't good--it's great!

And it's BYOB, with no corkage! I wish we had a place in DC like this.

Get your azz down to Smiling 'Nana!"}
{"text":"I like SBL....The menu is Good and they have lots of choices for vegetarians..

The restaurant is not attractive and can't hold more than 10 people at a time..  It's a great place to order food and the staffs are very friendly"}
{"text":"I loved the food here! I got the red curry and it was probably the best Thai curry I've had. It was so creamy and flavorful. The spice level was just right for the number I picked. My sister got the green curry, which was also very good. My other sister order the pad Thai, which was also a hit! I've haven't tasted anything that I didn't like from this place. The atmosphere at this place is cute and trendy. The dining area is a little small, so if it's busy it will probably be better to call for reservations. I will be visiting this place again whenever I am in town!"}
{"text":"If this rating were based off the food alone, I would have to give it a 5. I am a bit if a Thai enthusiast and have been impressed by both the quality and the portion sizes of the dishes. However, I have to give it a 3 for these reasons: 

Every time I eat there, I'm cold. Truthfully, I run typically at a lower temperature than most, but when your boyfriend also needs to keep his winter coat on throughout the whole meal, you know it's too cold. 

Cosy or cramped? There is definitely a fine line. Also, the height of the booths does not measure up to the height of the table nor the chair sitting across from it. So if you're sitting on the booth side, you're going to be much awkwardly higher than the person who's sitting across from you.

Thirdly, they use a very strong cleaning product or soap in the bathroom that is right off the dining room, so you get that smell pretty much the whole time. 

I would still return because I love the good so much (particularly the pad see ew and the cashew chicken) and it is a sweet place for a date. I do wish above all they would turn up the heating in the restaurant, especially during winter!!"}
{"text":"Helluva place but don't blink cuz it's a bit tricky to find, the ambiance is amazing very intimate, the dining area is quite small ... The service was iffy.. If you needed a server you definitely had to flag them down.. ON TO THE MEAL.. I had chicken pad see ew, which was prb the best Thai food place I had ever had, also had the duck noodle soup which was very very good as well.!! I'd love to go back and continue to explore the menu..."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh- tied with Noodlehead, but two different types of restaurants.

The restaurant itself is adorable and makes you feel homely and welcome. Not exactly what I would expect from a Thai restaurant, but as soon as the food comes out, you know you're in good hands. My favorite dishes here are any of the curries except the pumpkin (too sweet for my palette) and the Pad Kee Mao. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the Pad Thai, but perhaps you'll have better luck. The Satay Chicken is wonderful, and the sauces it comes with are especially good. 

Pittsburgh has a surprising amount of Thai restaurants but I find myself coming back here time and time again, for good reason. The food is good, the prices are reasonable, the waitstaff is polite, and the ambiance is great. All I can ask for"}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is a go-to restaurant in our house. The small, but charming destination serves up simple and classic Thai favorites. Try their Pineapple Fried Rice, it is unparalleled!"}
{"text":"I have been to this little place several times. Overall, its impression on me is OK. 

Parking - Street parking. Usually relatively easy to find a spot near the restaurant.

Atmosphere/decor - Neat, modern, but extremely small. Usually extremely crowded, especially on weekends.

Food - Each time the food has been pretty good. It is definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh with regards to the food. The portions are not small, definitely filling. I usually order their curry, especially the roast duck curry. Today, we ordered a beef curry and the roast duck. We ordered one at spice level 5 and the other 3. Neither was overly spicy, but we couldn't tell the difference between the spiciness. 

Service - It's alright. Waiters/waitresses are quite friendly but always seem to be busy. When it's crowded, be prepared to wait for awhile for your food.

Compared to other Thai places in Pittsburgh, Smiling Banana Leaf is one of the better ones, but personally I would prefer Thai Gourmet just because it is usually less crowded and more spacious."}
{"text":"Amazing food! This was my first time here, and I was by myself so I only got to try the one dish, but it was the best Pad See Ew I've ever had. Positively stunningly good. Packed with flavor, noodles almost a little caramelized, just the way I like it. 

Also had the mango with sticky rice. Had to try it even though I was stuffed. As good as I've ever had. 

The place is tiny but with high ceiling and windows, so naturally bright. I knew when I walked in and saw the several smiling Thai women working the kitchen that i was in for a treat. 

Do not miss this place!"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Pittsburgh. Worth the wait for a table, but just as good for take out."}
{"text":"OMG I'm back here again I love there food.. They make the best red curry chicken mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"We went there on Mother's Day. They were understandably busy for lunch but we still got a table without too long a wait. 

The servers were friendly and attentive but I have to say the food was mediocre at best. We live in the Washington DC metro area where there are quite a few Thai restaurants and even those in the suburbs of DC, the Thai restaurants are head and shoulders better than the food served at this restaurant.

We went there based on the great reviews this restaurant has received and we were disappointed. Either it was an aberration to their usual quality or we just have a very different idea of what is good Thai food."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out, brought it home and couldn't stop eating it. I'm officially Thai'd out. Yet, I still want more :X THEY HAVE PUMPKIN CURRY. Agghhhhh!!! If you order won ton soup however, don't expect a plethora of won-tons; works out great if you're on a diet though! I ordered spicy on all dishes, maybe that's what made a big difference in taste.  Go already, bye."}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere inside is fun and cozy. My favorite dishes to get are the Glass Noodles with Chicken and the Green Papaya salad (I forget the name of it on the menu). I'm giving this 4 stars because sometimes the food is hit or miss. I think the Pad Thai is inconsistent (occasionally heavy on the fish sauce but then other times it is delicious!). But for sure a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is one of our favorite Thai places in Pittsburgh, and if Highland Park didn't \"seem so far out of the way\" (you know how it is to leave your part of the city, even when something is only a few miles away), my wife and I would be there way too often.

My only complaint is that the Smiling Banana Leaf sort of defines the line between being a cozy, intimate restaurant, and being simply TOO SMALL. Every time that I've gone, we've had reservations or picked up take out, but you still end up standing for a few minutes, packed uncomfortably in the opening of the restaurant or standing outside, while your table is prepared. Once at your table, you still feel the almost-claustrophobic size of the restaurant, but it's easy to adjust to due to the brighter lighting that takes the setting from a potentially intimate dinner to a more casual one.

Most of the hesitations go out the door, though, once you get your food. The food is excellent, and incredibly affordable. Your portions aren't likely to be as large as some other Thai restaurants in the city, but the price is perfect, and really, so are the portions...unless you're looking for a gluttonous evening.

The curries are tasty and the pad thai is my favorite in the city. My favorite Thai dish right now is actually the pad kee mow/spicy noodle from the Banana Leaf. Their wide rice noodles create a different texture than other similar dishes that I've had, and really sets it apart.

I'd say definitely make a reservation if you're going to dine in, as there are only about 8 or so tables. Otherwise, grab take out, because it's definitely one of the best Thai spots in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We walked into this small, modest, attractive BYOB on a Saturday night and were told it would be a ten-minute wait, which was fine, and then some nice people moved to a smaller table and allowed us to sit immediately.  The meal only got better from there.  The service was friendly, accommodating, and very fast.  The menu is pretty standard Thai, but the kitchen really knows what they're doing, and the stir-fries and curries we got were excellent.  The prices are quite low for the generous portions.  If I lived in this charming neighborhood, I would definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is a wonderful neighborhood gem with a number of delicious options.  At one point it may have been a well kept secret, but food this good doesn't stay secret for long.

The downside: The location is a little cramped, and the menu may be better suited for vegetarians than carnivores (I like meat better, but I have to confess the veggie stuff is better executed here)."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from us. The food is great. Whenever, we take friends or family here, no one ever leaves disappointed! The Pad Thai is very good. My only gripe is that the interior is small. So if you've got a group, it's sometimes hard to accommodate. FYI- SBL is BYOB."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is one of my favorite 'go-to's for delicious, filling and fast meal. I tried the Pumpkin Curry that everyone raves about, and it was quite good.  It's a little bit much.. very rich, but I enjoyed the flavors. My SO loves the Glass Noodles. We order for pick up on Sunday nights when I don't feel like cooking, and I always have half left over for Monday's lunch (not complaining!). It's lovely having this gem close by and not having to drive far for last minute take out."}
{"text":"First off, beware of the spiciness scale. I can handle my spice but when I asked for a 5 I was thinking it was going to be really mild. My mouth felt like it was in heaven and in hell at the same time.  The food was really good so I wanted to keep eating it, so I painfully ate every delicious bite. It probably was just a mistake or I'm becoming more sensitized to spice, but either way - the food was amazing. 

To start we had the samosas which had a bit of a twist on them! They had cucumber sauce and the dough was more similar to the wraps that spring rolls are made of.  It was interesting, but a little too sweet for my taste. I was looking for a more savory samosa. We had the pad thai and the panang curry which were good. However, the portions were pretty small and the prices were a bit high for how much food they were offering. The pad thai was not the best I've ever had but it sure beats a lot of other restaurants out there!

Another downside to this place is that it's so small! You almost always have to make a reservation, the only time I got in was on a random Thursday for lunch. The service was really quick which satisfied my impatient 5 year old self so again, remember to tip well!"}
{"text":"A group of friends dropped in on a warm Saturday night at this cute little restaurant. This is an incredible place for delicious Thai food!

Things I liked:
- great food! Everything from appetizers to our meals was spot on! Peanut sauce is on the sweeter side but had great texture and salty savory flavors as well. They paired well with extra crispy fried tofu, and grilled chicken skewers (maybe a hint of lemongrass?). I also ordered pumpkin curry, which was very flavorful.
- no corkage fee for byob!
-service was fairly quick, which was also a bit of a drawback
- outdoor seating would make an amazing atmosphere a summer night meal

Things I didn't like:
-a little crowded because the restaurant is relatively small
- I felt that the server taking our orders was a bit curt with us, perhaps a busy night? But overall service was pretty good (and the food was even better!)"}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled upon this place while walking around on a chilly night. It's cute and cozy, and right up my alley! I love Thai food because when I miss home food, Thai is the closest thing to it!  I ordered the tom yum kha and the spring rolls. I felt the portions were huge! Even though the soup was in the appetizer section and only 5$, I struggled to finish my bowl of soup. The soup had generous amounts of chicken. I got the spring rolls work shrimp, I felt like they tasted okay. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. And of course I am always faithful to Thai restaurants and will definitely come back to try more from the menu."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf, oh you. You know me so well. With your fair prices, tasty menu choices, and perfect balance of spices, how could I not have been smitten?

I couldn't help but feel a bit jealous that you've been seating other people. With your six or seven tables, I thought it would be just you and I forever. But no, you had to go and ruin everything we had and share your curry concoctions with complete strangers. They'll never love you like I do. They just sit there, fill their faces, and leave. Is that what you really want? Someone who dines and drives off? I can give you more than that, my Smiling Banana Leaf. 

Remember the time you made me a delicious duck curry? I do. I'll always remember what we shared, however short-lived it may have been. 

Smiling Banana Leaf, I guess what I am really trying to say is, every time I see a banana, or even a leaf, I smile.





I love you."}
{"text":"Came in without reservation, they made space to accomodate us. Curry noodle tasted good, but didnt like the soups. Portion size is huge."}
{"text":"A lovely little Thai restaurant on Bryant St. The outdoor seating is pretty! But the restaurant fills up fast so bigger groups would do well reserving their table. I've tried a few dishes here over time - pad thai, pineapple fried rice (yum!), the curry noodles, crispy spring roll. I have usually liked whatever I order. Once the person I was with got quite a bit of rubbery chicken with their noodles so maybe this is something the restaurant should look into."}
{"text":"This is a tough one...

5 for the Shrimp Pad Thai (good flavor, perfect noodle consistency, good shrimp)
3 for the Beef Basil Stir Fry (decent flavor, tough beef)
3 for the Chicken Penang Curry (good flavor, tough chicken)
2 for the Crispy Calamari Appetizer (SKIMPY portion- maybe 8 pieaces, too much breading)

I really wanted to like this place, but I was definitely a bit disappointed- decor was nice, service was good, but the food was really a mixed bag.  In addition to some tough meat, the portions were on the small side for the price.  

If you do go, get the Shrimp Pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly and fast. Fantastic food! Small place but worth the squeeze."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken pad thai. Wasn't anything to write home about. Hardly any egg or chicken; Thai Foon in Robinson is much better, flavor and protein-wise."}
{"text":"Why is the banana leaf smiling? Because it serves delicious Thai food! 

Had a great dining experience here. The restaurant is cozy and the food is prepared pretty fast. We tried the fresh rolls, mango salad, tofu paradise, yellow curry, pad see ew, and spicy fried rice. All of the dishes were full of flavor, and you can control the spice levels!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in the Pittsburgh area so far.  It's a tiny hole in the wall place so if you come at a busy time it may be hard to get a table.  Everything I've had has been really delicious and the staff are super friendly.  I particularly like that they have curry noodle dishes since those are hard to find.  I tried both the green and read curry noodles and both were delicious.  Prices are reasonable and they also do take-out.  My only complaint is that the inside dining room rather cold both times I went."}
{"text":"When I arrived and asked for the length wait, the host told me to go somewhere else with little to no explanation."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and portion sizes. I came here early on a Friday evening with no reservation and was seated immediately. After hopping off the bus, I noticed that the restaurant seemed small and inconspicuous, so I was a bit skeptical about the place. However I had heard good things from my friends, so we proceeded on our food adventure. We decided to order a Thai iced tea (only $2!!), the tofu paradise, and green chicken curry at spice level 3. The spice levels are only from 2-10, so we knew that the spice here would be no joke.

Our food arrived within 10 minutes. And oh man, it was good. The tofu paradise was an appetizer with fried tofu on a bed of shredded cabbage and vegetables covered in sweet peanut sauce. We were trying to decide between the two tofu appetizers and concluded on this one thanks to the suggestion of the waitress. It was sweet, crunchy, and definitely satisfactory. The curry, as predicted, had quite a kick to it. Personally I couldn't handle the spice, as I can't really handle any spice. Fortunately my friend was able to finish the curry no problem.

The food here is fantastic. My only complaints are regarding the service. We were seated at the table furthest from the counter and closest to the bathroom. After the waitress took our order and delivered our food, she did not check up on us at all. We had to ask a different server to bring us chopsticks and refill our water. At the end, we went up to the counter to pay as the waitress seemed to be too busy to bring us our check. Oh well, gave us a chance to stretch our legs! 

I will be coming back for their lunch specials. It's definitely worth it for the fare!"}
{"text":"While the food is really good, I'm not sold on the idea of making this a regular restaurant spot.

The service is always entirely too slow, especially for a place that has at maximum 20 people seated at a time. I also am not a fan of the whole \"shoulder-to-shoulder\" experience that comes with a tiny, cramped (albeit decorated quite nicely) dining room. 

Also, the prices are a tad bit high for what you get. More bang for your buck with the noodles dishes, but sometimes all I wanna do is get down with a big bowl of curry and call it a day!

If you're going to try it out, go for lunch in the middle of a week and never on a Friday or Saturday night, unless you want turned away because you didn't make a reservation."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh! This place is great. I especially like the green curry and the papaya salad. This place is also BYOB and they don't charge you a corkage fee."}
{"text":"Pineapple fried rice is fantastic. Cute place but very limited seating. Takeout is available."}
{"text":"So I absolutely love Thai food. It very well may be my favorite cuisine choice. While my meal here was not bad, I didn't think the overall experience was spectacular and for that reason, if I was going to get Thai food, I don't think I'd travel here to get it. Don't get me wrong, it was very good and if I was around here I would certainly not be opposed. It's just not my favorite. Perhaps I got my hopes up too high based on other reviews and expected too much. Our waitress was nice and prices were average for a nice dinner place. 

Anyway, the place is very small but was cozy and not cramped. We had a reservation but when we got there, the two people working the door were totally confused by the fact that we said we had one. Regardless, they fortunately had an open table so we didn't wait. Our waitress was very nice. Our apps included the fried tofu and crab Rangoon. The fried tofu was nothing to write home about but I'd certainly get the Rangoon again. 

I always get the red curry with vegetable and tofu. It was wonderfully flavorful and had the perfect level of spice for me at a 3. The one thing I love is pineapple in my red curry which this did not have. My greatest disappointment was when they told me I couldn't have sticky rice for dessert because the microwave was broken! What!?! That has to embarrassing for any restaurant. Such a shame. 

Check it out if you're around but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really small but the service is great and the pad thai is excellent.  Would definitely go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Holy moly I love it here. I want to live here and only eat Thai food from Smiling Banana Leaf for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 

It's a very small restaurant but decorated so well and tastefully. The service was excellent and everyone was friendly. The food was the best thing about this place. Every dish we ordered, and we ordered a few (purposeful leftovers), was delicious and spiced perfectly. The flavors made you want to keep eating even though we were stuffed. 

We also never order dessert but we did here and it was great! If we lived closer we would be back regularly."}
{"text":"I come here, sometimes, after sledding, running, and other Highlander activities that leave me too lazy to walk up the hill to home. The wontons are great, the pumpkin curry is great, but honestly, I've had better around town. Especially for the price. Some of their dishes seem to be missing something."}
{"text":"I've been to a handful of Thai restaurant in town and Smiling Banana Leaf is by far the best.
The outside tables are a  little bit wobbly, but are surrounded by fragrant flowers. Service was prompt and attentive - even when we came right before close. I fell in love with the pumpkin curry. Luckily, my friend enjoyed a hearty helping of my meal leaving me with enough room to sample the mango and sticky rice. The dessert was a perfect end to a delicious, reasonably priced meal.
Not to be missed!"}
{"text":"After having gone here four, maybe five times, I'm FINALLY writing a review.

I like this place a lot.  Their pumpkin curry is really really tasty (has chunks of pumpkin in it though so beware if you just want pumpkin flavor), and I've had their red and green curries as well.  I've tried bites of the spicy green bean and the pad thai, and I've enjoyed those.  Portions are generous--their lunch portion is what I'd eat for dinner and I've never finished their dinners--but prices are reasonable, less than $10 for lunch and less than $15 for dinner.  Service is always very attentive, but the place can get a bit loud during peak dinner.  Contrary to other Yelpers, I'm quite happy with the spice level--I've ordered a 7 every time and it's been consistently at the pleasant mouth heat level that I love.  I've tried my dining companions' 3s and 5s and they've been significantly less spicy, so I do think there is true variation there.

I've never made a reservation here, but I always try to go at the beginning or end of typical dinner times (i.e. 5pm or 8pm) and I've been fine.  I did try to go with a group of 5 around 7pm a week or two ago and we wouldn't have been able to be seated until 8:30, so we went elsewhere.  If all else fails, they do do takeaway, so you can get your curry fix without waiting for a table.

Also, BYOB--yay!  They do accept credit cards but twice when I've been there the machine has been broken so bring some cash just in case.  There's a small parking lot off the street, and parallel parking on Bryant St. as well.  The 71B goes right by here too.  GO!  Your mouth and wallet will thank you :-)"}
{"text":"I came here with pretty high expectations given the number of positive reviews on Yelp.  I've definitely had better...  The green curry I ordered barely had any meat/veggies.  And what veggies were in the curry looked like they had been boiled for 8 hours.  Meh."}
{"text":"Once again, Yelp steers us in the right direction. Delish! Don't forget to BYOB!"}
{"text":"I came here to have dinner and catch up with a few friends. We love Thai food, and we have tried almost every Thai restaurant within a 5-radius of Shadyside--except this one. So, of course, we had to try this place out before we graduate to the 10-mile radius and beyond (gas prices and traffic be damned, we want our fill of Thai goodness!).

Anyway, I arrived first, and the waiter (manager? owner? Sorry I can't be sure, but he's the one with the French accent) greeted me warmly and sat me down first. I told him two more people were going to arrive soon, so he quickly got me three glasses of iced water, menus, and silverware. After my friends arrive, he comes to introduce himself and the restaurant, and asked if we would like any beverages. One of my friends orders some tea, which he gets for her in no time. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, we order our food. I ordered the Green Curry Noodles with Tofu (spice level: 4), and my friends ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp (spice level: 0 [she doesn't do well with spicy food]) and Pad See Ew with Tofu (spice level: 3). It wasn't very busy at this time, so our food came out within 10-15 minutes.

My Green Curry Noodles with Tofu looked great. It had rice noodles, bell peppers, green beans, broccoli, eggplant, and Thai basil. I took a few sips of the broth and tasted really good and had a nice kick to it. My friends also really liked their respective dishes. Halfway through our meal, the place really started getting busy. It seemed like between each bite/sip of my food, a table or two became filled. By the time we were ready to leave, the place was packed. Nevertheless, our waiter never failed to refill our glasses with water and ask if we needed anything. When we were done, he got us a few take-out boxes for our leftovers and the check. Because of the good food and excellent service, my friends and I decided to give a generous tip.

Overall, a very good place to have a nice Thai meal. Although it wasn't the best I've had, it does rank pretty high in my personal list of Thai restaurants. I will make an effort to come back again to try their Pad Thai, which is one of my favorite Thai dishes, and their desserts. Honestly, who could resist Pumpkin Custard or the Sago & Black Bean with Coconut Cream? Even though I'm allergic to mangoes, I'll even try their seasonal Sweet Mango with Sticky Rice (with 911 on speed dial, of course!)."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in highland park. I recommend making reservations especially on a busy night. It is pretty small but accepts credit cards. I love that it a BYOB and all of my friends bought a bottle with us. Unlike other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh they don't charge you a fee to bring your bottles. That's a plus. I started off with the fresh spring rolls with tofu. Very good and light for an appetizer. If you weren't too hungry they could have been a meal. They came out pretty fast. I ordered the green curry at an 8. I actually ordered a 5 but they gave me an 8 on accident. I was fine with it and decided not to say anything. To me it was fine and it wasn't too much heat for me. It was perfect spiciness to where I could still taste the food. The prices are good and with an appetizer and an entree my meal came to under
$20. I would come back here when I come back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh!! Everything I've had has been wonderful and it's never a long wait to get your food! Great place and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is small but nicely decorated! I love the atmosphere. I've been to this place at least twice and I'm still a fan! Both times that I remembered I went  for lunch on a Saturday. There was no wait! So for those who do not want to waste time and eat good cheap thai food, this is the place!

I tried the Crispy Calamari and it was surprisingly good! Very different from large chain restaurants and has a home-y feeling to it. I wouldn't mind ordering it again! OH, and the thai ice coffee is yummy! It's on the sweet side, so if you don't like sweet coffee, don't order it.

From the same party, we had the chicken basil, chicken red curry, pineapple fried rice, curry fried rice, and pad thai. I'm a big fan of their red curry because of the coconut milk red paste.  The veggies that came with the curry were all delicious too. The pad thai was wonderful as well. The pineapple fried rice was a bit on the sweet side, but if you like it, it may be for you. The curry fried rice had its distinctive taste, but personally I prefer the red curry.

So if you don't want to wait and want cheap thai food, come to smiling banana leaf!"}
{"text":"I don't know much about Thai food, but I have to say what they serve at the Smiling Banana Leaf is absolutely delicious. I've had the sweet & sour entree with tofu and the pineapple curry also with tofu. Soooo good. The second time I visited my tofu could have been just a tad bit crispier, but the meal over all was pretty delicious. 

It is small and the outside and inside decor does leave quite a bit to be desired. As some others have warned, watch out for the spiciness! My boyfriend ordered his meal at a 7 (out of 10) and his eyes were watering! His entire face turned red and he finished off two glasses of water by the time he was halfway through his meal lol! He did very much enjoy it, though.

I have only eaten at one other thai restaurant in Pittsburgh, but this one blows the other out of the water. It is also BYOB, which I have not partaken in, but keep that in mind!"}
{"text":"This cozy Thai restaurant is fantastic!  On Bryant St it is away from the busier areas of the city.  The food is excellent and the service is great! Our waitress was happy to help us.  I got chicken pad thai.  It's a lot different from other Thai restaurants in the city but just as good.  The Thai iced tea and coffee were great!  Large menu.  Comfy cozy place for a nice dinner.  The spicy scale seems to be higher than other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.  8 was quite spicy."}
{"text":"After one meal at the Smiling Banana Leaf, I was pretty certain I was hooked. A second visit recently sealed the deal: every Thai meal in Pittsburgh will have to live up to the high standard set by the Smiling Banana. We had the panang curry and basil curry, and on our second visit, the crispy duck soup and noodles along with red curry. Everything was delicious, and the service on both visits was attentive and nice without being overly intrusive - which is hard for a restaurant with a tiny dining room.

Now that I've mentioned the tiny dining room, I can be honest. my biggest fear is not \"will I have a good meal?\" it's \"will there be a wait - I'm hungry!\" So far so good, but just for the record, it's food totally worth waiting for."}
{"text":"Planned to go to Noodlehead for dinner but too long of a wait there so we decided to stop here. We have heard good things about it but always went to Noodlehead when craving Thai. Looks like we found a new favorite Thai place in Pittsburgh. We split the chicken pad see yew and the chicken pad Thai...so delicious! Tastes more authentic than Noodlehead. Also, their spicy scale is a lot more forgiving. We ordered a 3 to be on the safe side, could have easily gone up another 2-3. Service was friendly and fast. Sat outside on a beautiful day. Will definitely be back! It also doesn't hurt that it's on such a cute street and parking was easy to find."}
{"text":"Wow, some of the best Thai food I've had. We started with fresh shrimp spring rolls which came with a sweet teriyaki peanut sauce. The appetizer was good, but the main entrees was outstanding!

I had the red curry with shrimp at a spicy level of 10. This was an actual 10. The kitchen uses fresh red chilies which make for a very spicy dish. I needed four napkins to blow my nose and wipe my tears. This might not be ideal for all; however, for those seeking serious spiciness, then smiling banana leaf has what you're looking for. Overall, it was an excellent curry. If you're not a fan of overly spicy dishes, then you can have the dish prepared at a lower spice level.

One of the drawbacks is that the restaurant  is quite small. We had to wait 30+ minutes for a table for two without a reservation. This wasn't a terrible inconvenience since there is a pub down the street. Just note that SBL is quite busy on Saturdays between dine in patrons and take out orders.

I would rate this restaurant four and a half stars if I could."}
{"text":"The place has a nice decoration and the food was tasty. I had red curry and it was very good. Also try their drinks, coconut juice and ice tea ..."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWESOME.  This was my first experience with Thai Food and i was not disappointed.  

I instantly fell in love with the atmosphere and then once I got the food, i fell in love with peanut sauce.  My mother and I got three different plate of food, and all of them were excellent.  

The waitress was also very nice and pleasant.  She even asked about how spicy we wanted our food.  

Absolutely perfect food.  Defiantly get the peanut sauce."}
{"text":"We were given the heat index option of 1-10.  I opted for five and it was just like the hotness level from the pier side in Phuket, Thailand.  The Panang just had the right amount of coconut and spices.  Unadulterated by starch it was just the right thickness.  The rice is Thai jasmine \"milagrosa\" not the cheap long grain that most other restaurants serve.  If they could only serve it on a bed of bans leaf it would seal the experience.  The tofu was most welcome after eating on travel much of last week.  The mango tilapia dish had their version of the mango chutney in sweet sour sauce.  Definitely a gem to visit at Bryant Street Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I got the chicken red curry, spice level 6 and my friend got chicken pad tai spice level 3. I would get them both again anytime. I called for take out and it only took 10 minutes which is perfect. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I like Smiling Banana Leaf quite a bit.  8 out of 10 times the food is spectacular.  I'm not sure what happens, but every once in a while the food is subpar.  I keep going back for more.  All in all this place is pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Japanese place to eat at in highland park but they were close so this Thai place was th next best option.
I had seen several reviews on yelp and it's high rating made me very curious so me and my hubby decided to try it...
The space is very small inside yet cozy for a midweek afternoon lunch...there's only enough seating for 20 people max but the new sofa chairs they have are extremely comfortable and roomy.
We ordered the fresh roll app along with the samosa. The samosa were small triangle shaped pastries stuffed with a potatoe mixture that was somewhat sweet and decadent..it also came with a sweet sauce with diced cumcumber that made it taste even better. The fresh rolls were good lots of fresh ingredients but to me they lacked flavor. The brown sauce that accompanied the rolls was delicious so it helped with the flavor aspect.
For lunch we ordered the pad thai and red curry at a spicy level of 6. I had tofu while he ordered chicken. The tofu was perfectly fried and the dish looked and smelled great..when I ate it, again the flavor didn't pop out at me but it was good enough. I believe the spicy was took away from the flavor of my dish. My mistake there. The red curry on the other hand was very good beat I've had before...very flavorful like it came straight from thailand. The spicyness made it even better.
We washed down out food with two mango juices which were smooth and not watery like the concentrated stuff..

Our bill ended up being $44 after tip and an extra order of samosa, a lil expensive for lunch but I would return again...plus it's BYOB!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh! I am a sucker for a good Panang Curry (Chicken or tofu) with a side of good, sticky, white rice, and I love the one that they make! I was so excited to find a great Thai restaurant in my new city. The Chicken Satay was also really good to have before the main dish! Smiling banana leaf is such a fun place to take your friends when you want to try something new! It's BYOB so don't forget to take your favorite Riesling and enjoy."}
{"text":"Perfect name for this place. I got food served on a banana leaf and everyone was so happy there! I had such a wonderful meal there with my friends. We enjoyed talking to the wait staff and our complex food requests were welcomed! We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is on our short list of places for an always-delicious, always-enjoyable meal. My favorite dish is the Panang Curry, definitely the best I've had in Pittsburgh. My husband likes the classic Pad Thai, and we are always satisfied with our assortment of small plate starters. Service is always courteous and attentive. No complaints from us."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!

Definitely make a reservation. I was skeptical when the hostess recommended making a reservation for a Tuesday night, but I'm so glad we did. The restaurant was packed! Granted, the place is small, but business was definitely booming. 

My husband and I ordered the chicken satay as an appetizer and the red curry and pad thai as our entrees. All of it was amazing. Loved the sauce that came with the chicken satay. I ordered my curry mild (level 3 on the spiciness scale) and it was perfect. I've noticed other people have mentioned the dishes weren't spicy enough - I guess I'm just a woos! My husband's pad thai was also tasty, probably some of the best pad thai I've had! Our server was attentive and friendly. They were the only server for the entire restaurant, but I never felt like we got lost in the crowd. My only complaint was not at the restaurant itself, but at my husband, haha! He forgot that it was BYOB and so we were left sipping on water. I don't think we'll forget a bottle of wine next time though! 

This place also does take out, which I'm sure we'll take advantage of one of these days."}
{"text":"If I lived down the street from Smiling Banana Leaf, it would probably be dangerous. I'd probably get takeout from here every time I didn't feel like cooking. Eating in again would be another story. It's just so tight in here it's pretty uncomfortable. Their entire space is smaller than my family room & every time the door opened yesterday, I froze. 

Now for the good part. Their food is really delicious! They have so many options on the menu and many are seafood dishes, which excites me. I had a hard time choosing but ultimately picked the prik poa talay with seafood, lots of veggies & a sweet chili paste. Yum! There are at least 7-8 other menu options I'd love to try. 

Previously we'd tried multiple veggie appetizers and they were all very tasty. Yesterday we ordered the fried calamari & unfortunately it arrived overcooked. It was probably a 10 second mistake, so I won't be too harsh on that when everything else I've ordered here I clearly loved. 

Service has been outstanding in both our visits here & they delivered a full 9 in spice to my husbands dish, which made him super happy. It's rare when this happens.  Prices here are super reasonable - my lunch entree was $10. 

I'm anxious to eat their food again, but from now on its takeout."}
{"text":"Not only the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh, some of the best food I've had in Pittsburgh. Split the Thai Samosas with a friend (wonderful!) and had one of the curry bowls. Rather than try to describe the food, I will only say that it's excellent. You absolutely must try this for yourself.

As a bonus, prices are very inexpensive for the quality & the atmosphere is welcoming and intimate. BYOB."}
{"text":"Have been there around 5-6 times.  Food was always pretty good.  Last time we went, the rude server, who I'm sure all the other reviews are referring to, told us we have to rush because there is a group coming who has a reservation.  She treated us as if she was doing us a huge favor to even be in the restaurant.  

Then she brought us out egg rolls, they were still frozen! gross.  We were going to just leave at that point, but, they rushed the rest of the food out really quickly upon us requesting the check.  Hopefully the management reads these reviews to see how many folks had a bad experience at the hands of the staff and that a change needs made."}
{"text":"We come from an area where Thai food restaurants (SF Bay Area)  are abundant so our review is probably a little bit harsh. We enjoyed the vibe , the staff and also there was plenty of parking to to be had. We had soup, flavored salmon and pad thai."}
{"text":"I had the eggplant+tofu with chicken over rice. It was *exactly* what I was looking for. A soft, well-marinated tofu and eggplant slices that had fully absorbed the flavors of the sauce. Absolutely fantastic, especially for the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time tonight and it was excellent. It is BYOB, which is a plus. We got the fried dumplings as a starter. He got the spicy fried rice with chicken, and I got the glass noodles with pork. Large portions, and my husband likes spicy so he got an \"8\"- he said that it was more of a 6 or 7. Overall, really quick and great. Small place so make a reservation if you can!"}
{"text":"I hate to rain on this place's parade, but I'm confused about why everyone loves it so much.  Every dish I have tried here has fallen short in my opinion.  I remember finding their basil fried rice to be decent several years ago, but a bit salty for my tastes.  In my most recent visit here, we ordered fresh rolls, massaman curry with chicken, and khao soi with chicken.  The fresh rolls were fine, but nothing special.  I would not order them again here if I paid another visit.  The massaman curry was too watered down and did not pack enough flavor (beyond being spicy).  It also was full of carrots, which is non-traditional for massaman curry -- not to mention they are zig-zag cut, which is kind of tacky.

The Khao Soi curry noodle dish was better, but still not great.  For example, the Chiang Mai noodles at Noodlehead (a very similar dish) are a few dollars cheaper and MUCH better than this Khao Soi.

Overall, I think this restaurant is about on par with other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh (Thai Cuisine, Thai Gourmet), but next time I go out for Thai it will be back to Noodlehead!"}
{"text":"I still think this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. The green papaya salad is on point, the other dishes are also delicious. I recently went to that other thai place on butler street...it has a nice ambiance and the food is also exceptional, but I just love the papaya salad at smiling banana."}
{"text":"I love, love , love this cute little Thai restaurant!  I have no idea what they put in their soup broth, but it could probably cure a whole litany of ailments.  If I could bathe in their wonton soup and drink straight from the pot, I would!  Do you know how many restaurants screw up wonton soup? A dish this simple can be easily made to taste like dirty bath water with clumps of soap.  However, this place pulls off a perfect symphony of delightfulness for your taste buds.

Now that I have waxed on the poetry of the soup, I just want to say that Thai and pineapple versions of fried rice are excellent, along with the massaman curry dishes and the pad kee mow (spicy noodles) dishes.  Pick any meat or stick with the vegetarian versions and you can't go wrong.

Additionally, the hostess is extremely friendly and accomodating here, which is a departure from some smaller Thai restaurants.

All in all, you can't go wrong at the Smiling Banana Leaf!

P.S. Some much larger restaurants can take a cue from whomever designed the decor in this place...It doesn't have to be large to fashionable or comfortable!"}
{"text":"I liked this place but didn't love it.

My Tom Kha soup tasted like pure coconut milk, I could not detect the lemongrass, or the cilantro. Also too sweet.

My pad Thai was forgettable, again too sweet. I forget whether a spice tray is offered here, I am sure one is.  Spice levels are not very hot. 

Parking is on the street do not park where the buses need to go (i think they are marked do not park to be fair). But my meal was repeatedly interrupted because of this. A little frustrated but it was not the owners fault, it was \"black BMW and black Benz\" as the manager asked over and over owners fault. So parking can be limited. 

No problems with service I just felt the food was a little over on the sweet side, the layering of spices was wrong. It is ok if you are tipping your toes into Thai. 

If you want authentic Thai over the Americanized version this is not it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this Thai place. I have had some amazing Thai food in Thailand and LA and this place comes close. One of the cool things is that you can order to your desired spice level 1-10 and they don't play, once you pass 5--it gets HOT! The curries, fried rice, and glass noodle dishes are the chosen favorites that I have had. I look forward to trying more soon."}
{"text":"Note: MAKE A RESERVATION, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE PLANNING ON GOING IN THE EVENING!

Kay had been wanting to come here for some time now. Deciding to deprive either of us no longer, we headed to the Smiling Banana Leaf Friday night. 

Yes, the seating is at a premium, and yes, it is small, hidden in Highland Park, a neighborhood I hadn't visited in decades. So by all means, make a reservation. They're even thoughtful enough to allow you to order up while you're waiting for a table so that your meal arrives promptly after being seated, steaming hot I might add. 

Our plate of Thai Samosa came, and we were off!  What you get is a quartet of fried wonton-type triangles that are filled with potatoes, carrot, and green peas. What was surprising to me was that each one was sweet enough to be a dessert. The four wedges also came with a clear, syrupy dipping sauce that had chunks of cucumber in it, making a good starter even better.

Our second appetizer was a bowl of their take on Wonton Soup, which Kay and I shared. I ate all the mushrooms since they aren't one of Kay's favorite things. You get two wontons of pork and shrimp in each bowl with baby corn, carrots, and spinach leaves taking a bath along with them. This was a total contrast to the rather bare Chinese Wonton Soup I am used to. The broth was hearty as were the soft, bulbous wontons. The veggies didn't need to be there but were far from unwelcome.

I really had no clue as to what I order other than that I knew I wanted something that was quinessentially Thai. Enter the dish known as Pad Thai. Upon reading about Pad Thai, I am disheartened to discover that it was popularized and made into Thailand's national dish by a fascist Prime Minister. I am racked with guilt over enjoying it so much. 

Peppery and sweet, this dish was too erotic to be served legally, and I am not exaggerating. The beautiful tangled mess of precisely cooked noodles obscured a treasure in the crispy, delicate Tilapia that I discovered pieces of throughout the Pad Thai. Each chunk was a flavor-packed prize, and sadness filled my being when I realized that I had eaten all of them. I ordered mine with seafood (you can also get beef or shrimp), so in addition to the Tilapia, my Pad Thai also entailed calamari, baby scallops, and shrimp. 

Do Asian restaurants ever get seafood wrong? Each time I order a seafood dish at an Asian eatery, the seafood itself is always consummately cooked, and this was most definitely no exception. 

Kay got a Yellow Curry with beef, and it reminded me of Mulligatawny in a favorable way.

Dessert for two came in the form of the Fried Smiling Banana with Ice Cream. Mashed banana was wrapped in a fantastic foursome of spring rolls, drizzled with caramel, served alongside a mound of a slightly tart, vaguely banana-laced vanilla ice cream, and made for a cool, refreshing, and tantalizing epilogue to our Thai meal.

And we weren't stuffed despite the generously-portioned entrees. Thai food seems to fill you up without making you feel 9 months pregnant. 

The atmosphere is very chatty, noisy, and dare I say intellectual? Man, the conversations I overheard (someone was in the middle of doing important research and obviously wanted the entire room to hear of it). The clientele was highly diverse as well. As we walked in, we saw a group of Indian people laughing it up over wine. Our small table was flanked by a duo of Asian students (I tend to eavesdrop a tad) and a happy gay couple (one of them had recently been to the dentist. again with the eavesdropping...yeesh). You can't get that in every part of Pittsburgh.  

Although it was packed and clamorous, we found SBL to be both romantic and warm. Speaking of warm, the staff was just that. We were greeted with smiles, sent on our way with smiles, and  were made to feel like longtime family friends. Before we walked out, we were asked how we liked our meal. When I proceeded to rave about how good it all was, I was thanked profusely like a judge giving a 10 to an aspiring dance troupe. The expressions on their faces was a reward even sweeter than our dessert.  

Come to SBL and find yourself rewarded with exotic delicacies, expert preparation, reasonable prices, enthusiasm, and sheer graciousness."}
{"text":"Thai one on!   Good Thai food.  Place was jumping.  As we walked up to SBL we could smell this wonderful aroma.  What a way to start...really made my taste buds swirl!  Server was very good, made sure drinks were full but not overbearing.  It is BYOB but we did not BYOB.

Tables are small...as is the restaurant.  
Seem to get many take out orders. 

Started with the Tempura shrimp with vegetables accompanied by sweet and sour sauce.  Very average and no real veggies - just two lettuce leaves.  Ordered the Spicy Green Bean entree.  They ask how hot you want the sauce..from 1 to 10.  Had a 6 and it was plenty spicy with the ability to still taste the food.  The sauce was oh so good!  Made sure there was not any left on the plate..."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to me, please open another, please please! I absolutely love SBL (as me and my friends have began calling it), and honestly think about it atleast 2-3 times a week. 

The dishes are consistent (hard to find at any Asian eatery in Pittsburgh) and you're likely to get the same delicious flavors every time you stop by. 

The service is on point, the prices modest, the decor is adorable, if only they had a bigger space!"}
{"text":"Tiny neighborhood place with great food. Menu is not particularly large, but the food is very good. Portions are a bit on the small side, but perhaps it seems so because everything is so tasty.

Don't miss the coconut sticky rice with mango if it is in season.

Staff is great."}
{"text":"We just went here for the first time, and I must say it won't be our last. We had the Red Curry and the Pad See Ew, both were delicious. The most authentic Thai cuisine I have found so far in Pittsburgh. Very relaxing atmosphere. Service was great. The restaurant is clean and the prices are reasonable. Needless to say, we will be back, and we highly recommend this little dive to any and all Thai cuisine lovers."}
{"text":"I have only ever had take-out here twice.  I asked for a 5 on the spicy scale and was not able to eat it because it was too hot.  The second time we did not ask for any spice and, although It could have used a little spice, It was incredibly delicious.  I will stay and get a seat next time.  My advice is, ask for a little less spicy than you normally ask for anywhere else."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and wanted some curry. Looked on Yelp and this place had great reviews. I ordered the red curry with jasmine rice and my co-worker had the green curry with noodles. I know my curries and these both knocked my socks off. I believe what sets it apart is the fresh veggies used in the curries. There is a difference. This little hole in the wall is quaint with ecclectic motif. I love the BYOB thing too. :) I honestly cannot wait to come back and have recommended this place to many!"}
{"text":"I am a Thai food lover and have tried plenty of Thai places in Pittsburgh...this is one of my new favorites! Plenty of vegetarian options - most dishes could be ordered without meat. I had the yellow curry noodle bowl with vegetables - massive portion, yummy noodles, incredible flavors. I especially loved the crunch of onions on top which isn't something I've seen before. We also tried the crab Rangoon which was some of the best I've had - but for $6 I think it could come with more than 5 pieces. This is a really intimate spot - not many tables so definitely make a reservation if possible. Parking is easy in this area so that's not a worry."}
{"text":"Awesome!  My friends and I just drove in from DC on our way to Chicago after seeing the rating for this place and I have to admit, there isn't enough stars that can attribute to their greatness!  The service was amazing, you could really feel like this was a family restaurant and the atmosphere was beautiful.  Very modest on the outside, it was a pleasant surprise to see how upscale it was on the inside, without a feeling of pretentiousness.  

Now to the important part.  The food was very delicious!  I had the \"garlic\", with my friends having the pad thai and teriyaki and we each had trouble deciding which one was the best!  If you're passing through Pittsburgh like we were, you have to stop by this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food!!  I had the green curry noodles and Tom yum soup.  We shared chicken satay ( the peanut sauce was creamy luscious) and the fresh shrimp rolls!  Everything was fresh and so full of flavor.  The curry was awesome with lots of vegetables and I love the noodles in the curry, not always easy to find!!  The flavor profile of the Tom yum soup was the best I ever had.  The broth was rich and luxurious. I had spice level 8 which was perfect!  
Can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again to come back!"}
{"text":"I frequent takeout here, and they recently have not been as good. My order has been incorrect several times, and I have been underwhelmed by some of the dishes I've tried recently. I don't think I'll be going back anymore unfortunately"}
{"text":"Picked up food to-go from here and it was delicious!
Service was good- took about 15 minutes to get our order.
This is one of those hole-in-the-wall restaurants that is really good, and is a must try. 
We ordered the spicy mango salad, veg rolls, pineapple curry, and pumpkin curry which were all delicious. I also ordered a Thai iced tea to go which was a bit too sweet for my taste but was still enjoyable. 

MUST TRY
Pumpkin curry- perfect blend of curry and spicyness. Delicious over rice. Ask for extra spicy sauce on the side and add to taste."}
{"text":"Well kept secret that I sure am letting out. I love to get the mango chicken salad with the fresh chicken roll as an appetizer. Very light, refreshing and filling. The basil chicken is also very delicious. My top three favorite foods to get. They have fantastic prices and quick service. The staff is always very friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere is small and cozy."}
{"text":"The lunch menu is fantastic (few bucks cheaper than the dinner menu)!  Every item is delicious, I try to get a different dish each time I go.  In my opinion it is the best/most authentic Thai food in Pittsburgh.

Its a small venue though, so its hard to accomodate large groups.  Its also far from CMU campus, so I can only make it out maybe once a week (wish it was more!)."}
{"text":"This place is okay, I've had better thai in other restaurants. I order the chicken pad thai for lunch today. In my opinion the vegetables were over cooked and quite mushy plus the sauce itself was way too sweet. 

Unfortantely I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Our Garmin lead us through a very sketchy neighborhood to get here.  We were just about to turn back when we noticed the area got a bit more hipster.  Figuring that I could beat the plaid & mustache out of anyone who tried to do anything ironic to my car, we decided to go in.

So glad we did!  This was the best Thai food I've ever had.  The seafood was tender, the peanut chicken curry was well balanced and the summer rolls were tender and delicious.

A word of caution.  Order a little less spicy than you think you should.  They are judging heat by Thai standards, not by my pallid tongue."}
{"text":"I love coming to Smiling Banana Leaf, and even if you haven't been how can you not giggle at the thought of it with a restaurant name like that? This gem is tucked away in residential neighborhood and for those who find it are in for a treat. The space is small (we're talking maybe 6-8 tables) but the atmosphere is cozy and intimate. It feels really calm too. Service has always been awesome. You're greeted with a smile and the staff has been very polite - they check up on you to make sure the experience has been good throughout the meal.

And now on to the food - everything that we've had has been so scrumptious from the calamari and samosas to the curry dishes, pad sew yew, chef specials (mango tilapia) and fried rice. We haven't gone wrong yet.

The portions are just right though do be warned if you don't want  your food spicy at all make sure you make it clear. We've asked for dishes that have a spicy level of 2 and others that have a level of 6 and they both seemed to be equally hot. Even with the discrepancy, plates have been wiped clean. To boot the food is cheap.

We just keep coming back for more that if there was a tshirt with a smiling banana leaf I would just buy one."}
{"text":"My friend and I met for dinner last night and had a pretty enjoyable experience! First of all, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to find street parking nearby the restaurant (that's usually something that I dread).  Then they sat us at a nice table by the corner window, and we were the only ones in there for the majority of our meal.  My friend ordered the fresh roll of the day (it was shrimp and was pretty good) and pineapple fried rice (spice level: 5). I ordered the crispy taro spring roll (which was excellent) and the pad see ew (spice level: 6).  We both enjoyed our food, but it was huge portions so we needed to take about half home.  Our food came out to us with record-breaking speed, and both dishes had a lot of flavor. My only warning would be with regard to the spice level.  I like spicy food, and I thought I was being safe by ordering a 6 (out of 10), and it was still pretty darn hot (pore-sweating hot)! Overall, we had a very enjoyable experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"So delicious. I loved the Tom yum soup, pumpkin curry, papaya salad. You can't go wrong with any of the items here. I like things to be on the spicier side, so I got 7/10 and it was really good (made my nose run tho). They have lunch and dinner prices weekdays (dinner is $3 more), but dinner prices all day on weekends. Portions are all the same regardless. Pricy, but authentic.

Update: tonight i tried the pineapple fried rice and mango curry. The fried rice was nothing special, just regular fried rice with bits of pineapple. I'm used to pineapple fried rice that has the flavor of pineapple infused throughout the dish, but that was not the case here. As for mango curry, I liked it better with pumpkin. Still good place."}
{"text":"AMAZING

I came here based of the reviews and the som tum they had on the menu. I loved this as a kid and I cant find a Thai restaurant anywhere that has it.

I had the som tum and chicken panang curry and both were excellent. I don't remember what the other 5 of my family ordered but everyone enjoyed everything they ate. I ordered 2 stars based off many reviews and found that it wasn't spicy enough. I'm usually not a fan of really spicy food in the Thai category so I'm surprised my review isn't of the same opinion of others. Usually Medium is my max and at some places it's to much. However I wish I would of went 3 or maybe 4 start here on the spice. 2 was very mild to little heat.

The place was very small, seating for 22 so make a reservation and the place was full by 6:30-7:00.

Service was great and everything went smoothly. they were very friendly to my 6 & 4 year old and they didn't mine kids."}
{"text":"Yelp'd \"thai food\" while visiting Pittsburgh and ended up here.  Probably a good thing we visited it between Christmas and New Year's because it is TINY and presumably less crowded due to the timing...a great neighborhood restaurant, but if they take reservations I would strongly encourage (we were 4 and just walked in...and probably got a little lucky that a table was open). I'm almost strictly a Phad Thai and spring roll person, so that's the basis of my review.  The fried spring rolls were good, but, disappointingly, they were room temperature...as if they had been fried earlier and deliberately served that way...call me picky, I like to feel like they just came out da frier.  The Phad Thai, however, was quite tasty.  I've had better in PA, but that's no complaint, this was still pretty darn good. Good portion size, fair pricing. I would certainly recommend this place...very quaint...very neighborhood...probably an awesome place to walk to on a nice summer evening if you live in the area, but also worth the jaunt if you're an out-of-towner (be warned, parking can be a challenge).  And there's a cool coffee/pastry shop about 2 blocks away that's good too (but the name slips my mind...something with \"Enrico\" in it)."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been making our way to different Thai restaurants in the Burgh and we were very impressed with The Smiling Banana Leaf.  First of all it is on one of our favorite streets in the city because of Park Bruges.  Smiling Banana gives us another reason to visit Bryant Street.

 Parking was easy here.  We found street parking just a street over.  Walking in you can see that they have outside seating for the warmer months.  That helps because the inside is small but it isn't as small as we were thinking.  I did call ahead for reservations for two at 130pm on a Saturday afternoon.  They sat us next to a window at a two seater. It is small in there but we didn't think it was too small even if it was full we wouldn't feel that cramped.

 We were hungry so we ordered some Spring Rolls right away.  We received rolls probably with in three or four minutes of when we placed the order.  Carrie asked for them to whip up a special hot sauce paste for her and they did.  The rolls were ok.  We felt they tasted a little plain and we didn't taste hardly in shrimp in it.  The nut sauce and the hot paste they made helped it a lot.  It was a good roll but we have tasted better.

 Next we ordered our main dish.  Carrie got the Pad Kee Mao with TOFU and I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken.  Our food came out probably a little over ten minutes after we ordered.  It looked, smelled, and tasted great.  We both loved our meals.  For the price we feel we received more food than the other Thai restaurants that we have been to and they gave us a lot of meat (Chicken and Tofu).  We couldn't finish our food and it made great left overs later on for us.  Spice wise I asked for a 6 and my wife asked for a 7.  We both probably could have bumped it up a few ticks but still it was really good.  

 So this is now one of our favorite Thai restaurants in the Burgh.  I think it's the best for the price and the amount of food you get but it is right up there in food quality as well.  The Spring Rolls were a little disappointing but we will be back.  This is a 4.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"I've come here twice for a meal. I've tried the Pad Thai, Pineapple Curry, Spring Rolls, and the Tom Kha (coconut soup). Everything was delicious, exactly what you want from Thai food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"excellent quality food, plain and simple. appetizers are incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent pad Thai. There's an amazing Thai restaurant in Lubbock, tx called Thai pepper. This place is on par with Thai pepper."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food in a quaint setting. It is a tad small and we went on a Sunday directly when it opened. The staff is very friendly and the pad thai is delicious. Would go back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai place in da burgh. The atmosphere is for very small and its BYOB. So it's definitely not an ideal place to eat in at. My suggestion is to use it as a takeout spot, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay, it's a leap of faith walking through the door.  Every time I drive up to SBL I think it's a dry cleaner.  

Once you cross the threshold its a completely different experience.  
You are greeted by an excellent waitress (tall woman, adams apple), and seated in a very tasteful, if small, dining room.  Excellent Thai Food!  Great service, nice decor inside.  

I loved the green curry beef with eggplant.  Yum.

BYOB"}
{"text":"Finally got to give this place a try! Definitely make a reservation ahead of time if you can since the restaurant is very small. We came around 6 on a Saturday for dinner, and the other tables were all already taken. 

I ordered the Pumpkin Curry at a spice level 3, and my friend ordered the pineapple fried rice at a spice level 7. Surprisingly, her dish was not much spicier than mine if at all. This was my first time trying Pumpkin curry so I don't have much to compare it to, but it was delicious! It was very rich and creamy with a nice sweetness from the coconut milk and pumpkin. The portion sizes were huge as well, and we left stuffed with plenty of leftovers to take home. Overall I was impressed with the food and I will definitely continue coming here for a Thai fix!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai food places in Pittsburgh. Everything I've ordered here so far has been so tasty. I've tried their curry, their pad see ew, pad Thai, and glass noodles. Pad Thai was average, everything else I really enjoy. This place is great for dinner, the atmosphere is pretty intimate and relaxing. The customer service is also great. 
Recently, I like ordering to go from this place since my boyfriend lives around here. And my food is usually ready within 20 minutes. Quick and delicious go to dinner for us!"}
{"text":"I love the small, cozy interior. The decor is modern with authentic accents. A quaint little place tucked away that serves amazing foods.

My favorite item on the menu is the mango salad. The aroma and flavor from mango, cilantro and onion is a joy to behold. Refreshing and enjoyable to eat year round."}
{"text":"The only reason that I didn't give five stars is because I order take out more often than I stay and sit, so I can't speak to the service. Their pad see ew is the best that in the Burgh and their yellow curry is delicious as well. The last time I ordered the pad Thai, it was bland, but it's been delicious before so I could've caught the kitchen on an off night. The beef noodle soup is also tasty. I'm a huge fan of pho and Thai and the broth in this dish is delicious, warm, and spicy even by itself."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place based on all of the reviews, but overall I wasn't very impressed with the food (more because of personal taste rather than them)

What we sampled: 
Tom Kha soup with chicken and with shrimp (overall it was a good version, but I was a bit confused by the cabbage that was in it?  I have eaten a lot of Tom Kha and have never seen this before)
Pad Thai (way too sweet.  It was sitting in a pool of very sweet sauce that was a bit too much)
Red Curry (one of my faves, but I did not like the peas in it.  I specifically didn't order the duck curry because it mentioned peas and then I found them floating the red curry)
Mango and Sticky rice (delicious)

Overall service was very friendly and prices were good, but there is so much thai to try in this town I don't know if I would feel the need to return immediately."}
{"text":"This place is so so highly rated and talked about I was surprised at how small it actually is!  I can't imagine what the wait would be for a dinner, let alone a weekday lunch, where every table was full still.  But it's super cute and intimate with the benches lined in cozy pillows.  

My Pad Thai was good, but oh so small.  I think I received the lunch portion.  I didn't specify, so it was my bad.  But I gobbled my dish up in about 5.5 seconds and I wanted more because it was so good!  The shrimp was plump and the sauce was sweet, just how I like it.  Maybe it's my big American appetite, but I definitely left hungry.  Just a little taste of magic!

Very good Pad Thai, yes.  But here's the thing... This place is SO highly rated I feel like I need to go back and be adventurous!  Next time, adventure's on!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's great whether you are eating there or getting take-out, but if you eat in be aware that it's BYOB. You can get a pretty good Thai iced tea though if you're not into alcohol. 

The food is reliably good and the portions are fair for the prices. I've always had a pleasant experience dealing with the folks who work here as well. If I had lived in Highland Park I would have eaten here all the time."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I loved the green curry, and I also tried my friend's pad Thai and it was good. It gets packed here, so call ahead if you don't want to wait long!"}
{"text":"Such great Thai food. I have a few friends who have lived in Thailand and they say this is the real deal.

Small dining area but that doesn't matter because the food is so so good.

Great portions for the price. 

Quick and good service.

Will definitely be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"We stopped here after the zoo one day - BEST DECISION EVER. I've had a lot of Thai food from a lot of places, and this is the best Thai food I've ever had. The service was friendly, the atmosphere was cozy and quaint, and even though it's out of my neighborhood, I will be returning regularly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is just down the street from my house, so we go there or carry out all the time. Their curries are exceptional - and hot. They roast their own chills on site, so their 2 might be hotter than some are used to. Their Pad Thai is one of the best we've ever had. They used to have fresh spring rolls but don't anymore, and that's the only reason I didn't rate the place a 5. Bring them back! Bring them back! It's BYOB, and I'm not sure if they have a corkage fee. They have outdoor dining during nice weather, but the indoor dining room is very small, and this is a popular place, so it's a good idea to make a reservation. Ample parking in the surrounding neighborhood. And the 71A and B stop right outside the door."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Everything was accurate, fresh, and extremely tasty. Restaurant and facilities were clean. Nice decor, cold drinks, and outside seating available. If we lived in Pittsburgh, we'd definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"There are very few quality Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh, but this Thai restaurant delivers. Realize, though, that this place is very small - only about 6 tables inside, and 2 or 3 small tables outside on the sidewalk. The food is clean and flavorful - and our dishes were perfectly cooked, and not greasy. If you are in the area, I would definitely recommend a visit to this place."}
{"text":"- Decor: Upscale modern done nicely, very very small dining room.
- Food: Curries are solid. I loved the Pad See Ew and the Pad Thai. 
- Value: Prices are what you would expect with the quality of the food and decor.
- Service: I have been here three times and each time service was friendly and attentive.
-Bonus: Pittsburgh has very few good Thai food and fewer that are this great. Definitely worth going out of your way for. This is the best Thai in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Smiling Banana Leaf is hands down the best Thai food in the city, and is my go-to dinner spot when I'm craving Thai. The restaurant is small and cozy, but modern after the refresh with almost an industrial homey feel.

I've had many things here, but my favorites remain the Pad See Ew, Pumpkin Curry, Red Curry Noodles, and Pineapple Curry. Everything is always very flavorful and steaming hot when it comes out. I've never had a bad meal here and always recommend it to friends when they are deciding on where to go.

On top of delicious food, the service is very good and food comes out really quickly. They started taking reservations, and I'd definitely recommend calling ahead."}
{"text":"Visiting from Toronto, we decided to try this place based on its Yelp reviews. Let me just start by saying Toronto has a TON of Thai restaurants; none of which compared to this one. 

This was hands down, THE BEST Thai food I have ever eaten in my life. So fresh. So delicious. So tasty. This place KILLED it. 

We had the pork spring rolls, chicken satay skewers, pad Thai and rad na bowl. All were amazing. 

Honestly; if you live in Pittsburgh and have never been or you're just visiting and looking for a good authentic Thai place (situated in a cool neighbourhood setting). THIS IS THE PLACE!

Do yourself the favour and get yourself here! ASAP! Your tastebuds will thank you."}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai food in Pittsburgh. Although this is not as frequently mentioned as other Thai places everything I have had is outstanding and the spices are always dead on. I have had both their pumpkin curry and pad kee mow (spicy noodle) and both were excellent. They are also one of the few thai restaurants in Pittsburgh that serve green papaya salad, which is a stable of thai food and a special treat to find. The place is small so it can be hard to get a table if it is a busy time, but they also do take out well. The staff is always friendly and eager to be of assistance. Do not miss out, you will not be disappointed and end up with a flavorful thai meal!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  I continue to get the chicken pad thai, but have also tried a number of other things on the menu.  Nothing has let me down yet, it is all just fantastic.  The service is usually very good.  My one minor complaint about SBL is that the dining area is rather small.  However, they also do take-out, so if you live around the area, it would not be a problem to get your meal to go.  If you are coming with a large group of people, you might want to reconsider as they do not exactly have the adequate seating for this."}
{"text":"I did it, I fiiiiiinally ate here! Whew! I'm giving it five stars for taste and service, but I hate that the prices change drastically at night and that it is so teeny-tiny! But cozy, for sure - I mean, people. seriously. did not want. to leave. 
Anywho! I shared a dinner-sized portion of the salmon with red curry sauce with a friend, and there was plenty for both of us. Even still, when I asked for a little more of the curry sauce, we were happily obliged!  I think we were seated in the coziest part of the restaurant - a four-seater right near the wrap-around front window, with a wall-bench (and pillows!) on one side and chairs on the other. Nice, candle-lit ambiance and oh man, I was thinking of the food the whole way home and almost (almost) did not brush my teeth that night, to preserve the flavourful sanctity."}
