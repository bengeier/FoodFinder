{"text":"Disappointing. The asian salad was good, fresh, nice flavor in the dressing. The focaccia bread, fresh. The strawberry salad was fresh, but the strawberry dressing was overpowering.  Too sweet. A light vinaigrette would have been better. The Thai coconut soup--nice flavor in the broth but the long stringy dry chicken strings in it ruined this soup! Made it very hard to eat, and the strings were dry and ew. like twine in your soup! The bakery case has huge cookies and cupcakes, etc. They look delicious but the reality is stale, non flavorful, dry. The pineapple upside down cupcake was dry, and tasted like a piece of cornbread with an old piece of pineapple on it.  The cream horn was good, but whoopie pies, dry. Stale. I really wanted to love this place, but no."}
{"text":"heard good things about them, but havent had a chance to try them  because when I get off from work, their closed, maybe one day I will catch them open."}
{"text":"We had breakfast and bought some baked goods from the display and thought they were okay (I've had some amazing good baked items since I love bakeries).  However, we did order an apple cranberry crumb pie to pick up and take with us when visitng family and we all loved it (which is the reason for the 4 stars)!!!  Would be willing to try the other pies as well."}
{"text":"Went there with my husband this past Saturday. We had the Thanksgiving and California club sandwiches with the sweet potato chips and potato salad. Everything was amazing! Generous portions, great service, and just down right delicious! Afterwards we took home a doughnut, blueberry turnover, red velvet cupcake, and lemon bar. Which of course, all were incredibly yummy! While we were there it did get busy, but they handled it pretty well and we received our food in a timely manner. You can buy anything from Sweet Pickle and it's going to be amazing, hands down."}
{"text":"Customer service is great over all but the baked goods... is a different story.Dry and artificial tasting.  leave you wanting to wash your mouth out after because of a bad taste."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good. I usually either get the Thanksgiving or the Reuben. Both are great but skimpy with meat. I have never had a good baked good there. Every cupcake and cookie I have tried has been dry, crumbly and leaves a weird taste in your mouth.  I ordered a carrot cake for my boyfriend's birthday. It spoiled within a couple of days . It is way overpriced for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time today. It will not be the last time. Neat and clean.  Nicely decorated. Great service at the counter.  Food took an appropriate amount of time and was worth waiting for.  Got a cowboy cookie and a half loaf of marble rye to take home."}
{"text":"This sweet bakery and eatery has lots of variety! They have a meeting room which is great for small groups to host their event. Staff was very friendly.   I'm from New York and know what's out there and his place has class!! A 5-star plus from me."}
{"text":"We stayed in town for a week, and visited this restaurant  over and over!  Great food, great service, and great prices!  Can't ask for better than that!  Be sure to try the black and white cookies, or the whoopie pies....they are big enough for two!"}
{"text":"Sad excuse for a delicatessen and bakery. The $9 turkey sandwich meal was a hardly a sandwich. Half of the bread fell apart when I picked it up and the other half was stale, hard and dense?  After the best part of the sandwich being a disappointment the turkey meat was actually quality stuff, but for the $ I wish there was more.  Just call it a deli."}
{"text":"The food is consistently great, and the sweet potato chips are a welcome change from the standard fare.   They seem to be understaffed, and the speed of service suffers appreciably at peak times.  There is no traditional waitstaff, yet you pay when you leave, which is puzzling to me. The system further exacerbates the time it takes to eat, as everyone has to stand in to order, and again to pay for their meals on the way out."}
{"text":"We were traveling through and \"yelped\" a good spot for lunch...thanks to great reviews, we took a break here and so glad we did!  Our road trips are powered by food and we love finding small, local joints to support. The place was adorable inside and had a great setup for ordering. It was a vast menu easily laid out on posted chalk boards. The kids menu was very reasonably priced and upon eating...was a lot of bang for your buck!  Loved the soup and focaccia bread...holy homemade deliciousness!  The food was a bit slow coming out, but it was only from it being homemade and extreme attention to detail of taste. I'll take slow with superb quality any day!  So glad we stopped!"}
{"text":"So over the past few years I have had many friends that order cakes here and I have sampled them.  For my 40th Birthday in Feb my friend had gotten my cake here and it was decadent, rich and delicious!   Finally my husband and I were in the area and we decided to check it out for lunch.  I had a bowl of potato and Chorizo soup, it was served with a side of grilled foccacia.  The soup was very flavorful and large!  I could not finish the whole bowl of soup.  My husband had the chicken salad on croissant with a side of potato salad.  He enjoyed both, he said he prefers his chicken salad chunky, this was more of a shredded chicken.  It was a large amount of chicken salad and it had pecans and grapes in it.  The potato salad had just a pinch of grainy mustard gave it a unique texiture and flavor.   I also came down later in the week with a friend of mine for lunch.  I had the fall harvest salad, Again, large portion and great flavors.  My friend had a roast beef and horseradish wrap... which she said was great!   The choice of pastries is large and everything looks delicious. Like I said I have tried several over the years that other people have bought and all have been great! LOVE that they sell fresh bread and they will slice it for you if you want. The staff is very friendly and will explain anything you want.   Worth the trip to Kannapilis!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!  My father loves the Reuben and gets it every time.  It is loaded with lean corned beef on the bakery's marble rye.  He loves it.  The Cuban and the Thanksgiving sandwiches must be tried.  They are so good.  Don't miss the sweet potato chips made on the premises and their potato salad.  I always thought my potato salad was really good.  The potato salad at Sweet Pickle is great.  The bread from the bakery:  oatmeal, marble rye, challah, and sourdough are a treat.  Oh, and yes, my Dad loves the Whoopie Pies."}
{"text":"tried the Thansgiving spread sampler with brown sugar and roasted pecan seeet potatoes, turkey, mashed abd gravy, wonderful apple cranberry pie. Pretty good Southern fare. wide variety of sandwiches (including muffaletas yum !), baked goods including some original ones, donuts. crowd is pretty Southern too. the cops seem to like to hang out here so leave your contraband at home. a very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing. Great sandwiches. Tomato basil soup is the best I've ever had. Stop reading and hit directions.....thank me later"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to make the drive to try out this bakery in it's Kannapolis location and haven't made it yet, but lucky for me they have a booth at the Piedmont Farmer's Market on Winecoff School Road and I met the super friendly Sweet Pickle employee (I'd guess the owner's husband maybe?)  This review is for the absolutely delicious homemade oatmeal pie that I brought home this past weekend!  Think Little Debbie style (soft cookie - creamy filling) but then multiply it by about 4 and add another inch of cream, I'm NOT exaggerating here!  My sister purchased some oatmeal bread and has been raving about how good it is and that I'll have to get some next time as well.  She had sampled their homemade chicken salad on a previous visit to the market, but we learned today that it gets snatched up pretty fast and we were too slow this time, but we'll know better for the next trip to the market!  I'm adding their store to my list to yelp...the whoopie pies and creme filled horns and the breads...oh my...I need to sample them too!"}
{"text":"I had the all day breakfast sandwich and curly fries.  It was DELISH.  The sandwich was on sourdough bread, but you can pick the bread you want.  The curly fries were hot and plentiful.  As always, a great meal at the Pickle."}
{"text":"Everything I've tasted at Sweet Pickle has been delicious. The tomato soup, sandwiches, coffee, cream horns, cookies. The ladies who work there are very friendly. Only gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of the ambiance. Could use a little TLC. Does not stop me from visiting though :) we ordered my brother a giant cream horn for his birthday instead of a cake- it was huge and so good! Definitely recommend ordering one for a special event."}
{"text":"Not much to look at from the outside, but what a pleasant surprise on the inside!  Fantastic food, desserts, all around great spot!!"}
{"text":"Wow I have lived here in this area for almost 5 years and Had never heard of it until we stumbled upon it online looking for a new lunch spot at work. What a great little hidden gem. Everything is made fresh to order! And oh my what sweet pastry's they have! Though I did have to rebuke those in the name of my waist line lol but maybe next time! I totally had to put it on the Instagram share this place with the world!"}
{"text":"This is the magical place I have been looking for since I moved back to Cabarrus County. Thw only negative thing about this place is that it is so hidden! I think if they had a more prominent location, tons of people would know about this place. Skip out on the chain sandwich places and treat yourself to this place."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we just caught them on an off day or if we just have too high of standards when it comes to our sweets but this was not impressive at all. I will say; however,that the lady we had wait on us was extremely friendly and helpful and I loved her personality, it's such a shame that their food was a disappointment. I really hate to say it but I've had better stuff from Food Lion! We got an array of things and spent about $20 in total.   We got two pineapple upside down mini cakes, two smores bars (which were decent), an oreo cupcake, a carrot cake cupcake, a jack-o-lantern cookie which I think was a shortbread cookie, an acorn cookie which is a gingerbread cookie, a snickerdoodle cookie and two of the peanut butter cookies that have the chocolate kisses in the middle and we sampled a small cream horn.   I hate to say it but everything tasted extremely artificial. The cupcakes were VERY dry, as were the jack-o-lantern and acorn cookies. The snickerdoodle tasted alright, tasted like something you'd buy pre-made at a grocery store. The jack-o-lantern cookie had absolutely no flavor, even with the frosting on top that sort of just crumbled off and I didn't even taste it it was just so dry and flavorless. They look pretty though.   The pineapple upside down cakes definitely tasted artificial and the amount of sugar in those things was very overpowering. The pineapple you can just tell was from a can and not fresh. I don't think they used pineapple juice in them either and if they did it must have also been from the can, or had used some sort of extract. The lady said that they were fresh too, made that day.  Both the cupcakes were very dry, we couldn't even taste the chocolate flavor in the oreo one due to it's lack of moisture and the cookie bits on top were basically mush. The frosting on both of the cupcakes was hardened over a bit and tasted a few days old. Had the carrot cake cupcake not have been so dry, and would have had fresh frosting on top, would have tasted pretty good I mean the flavor of the cake was still there it was just dull. The peanut butter cookies were sadly the best things we had gotten, but they also tasted either a day or two old or maybe just a tiny bit over baked.   Neither of us liked the cream horn we sampled, the filling was just way too cream cheese tasting for our liking it didn't taste like a sort of frosting or filling but tasted rather like they had just scooped out some cream cheese, whipped it for a second and shoved it in. The pastry breading around it was tasteless and a bit hard.  All in all I really feel like it was a waste of $20 and we still have two items left over that we just cannot bring ourselves to eat. For stuff at a bakery to taste so extremely artificial it just makes me wonder how their so popular around the Kannapolis area. If their food was as great as their staff they could rally in some good business, but I don't see myself ever returning. And like I said maybe we just caught them on a bad day, but for everything we had gotten to taste so wrong I just can't see it being any better any other time."}
{"text":"I eat at yelp spots often and I thought this was worthy of the rating. Pretty good place and worth driving a little out if the way for some good stuff.  Very friendly service too. And had a thick Chocolate Chip cookie - home made that was amazing."}
{"text":"Housed in what looks like small warehouse. You wouldn't think much of this place when driving by, so I'm glad my friend recommended this place.  There were a large selection of sandwiches and salad menu items. My friend recommended the Thanksgiving panini with a side of sweet potato chips. The sandwich was delicious! They didn't skimp on the turkey, and I really enjoyed the sweetness the cranberry sauce added to the sandwich. Definitely reminds me of Thanksgiving leftovers. I was ready for a nap after that sandwich. Before I forget, the sweet potato chips are a definite must try. They make them in-house. I think they are pretty popular, because I saw a customer buy a pound of sweet potato chips to go.  They also have a lot of various baked goods, from breads to whoopee pies. The only issue I had was that the food took quite a bit to come out, but besides that if you are in the area check this place out!"}
{"text":"One of the best local spots in Kannapolis!  In a town full of great BBQ, it's hard to find a non-BBQ restaurant to eat lunch at.  This is that place.    The sandwich was very good, and the fries were good.  I got the curly fries, and they are one giant fry.  I had one fry that was at least two feet long.  Very interesting play on traditional curly fries.  Prices were very reasonable, and the service was good.  I travel to Kannapolis for work,  and will be eating many lunches here."}
{"text":"Pretty good, I here they are going out of business though. Too bad, though they were kind of tucked away."}
{"text":"Very very good cupcakes. Amazing marble rye bread!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. The food isn't that great and it's very slow. Their catering is okay but besides that I don't really recommend it."}
{"text":"I just ordered the grilled pimento cheese on sourdough with curly fries to go. As you can see with the picture there was not even a teaspoon of pimento cheese on the sandwich which was about 1/4 \" thick after being smashed in a panini press:(  There were a lot of curly fries but they were soggy & limp. If the place had been busy it would make more sense but I was the only person there getting a sandwich so I am more than disappointed. I will not be coming back."}
