{"text":"What stupid establishment refuses to serve you because you don't meet their minium drink order of one drink per person even when our order for food and shave ice was four times the value of what the drinks would come to? Your policy of minium drinks suck! Not everyone in our party wanted a bubble tea.....and yet you refuse our business...don't come here people..."}
{"text":"Hot pots are super awesome here! You can share by simply adding extra rice and meat or have one all to yourself!!! The only catch is you have to order a drink which is about $3.50 to $5.00 strange policy but I guess it ensures all patrons order something. Service can be iffy but I can't say no to the hot pots!!!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that we can order take out for bubble tea. We drop by whenever we're in town. It's on the higher price point (maybe about $0.50 more than normal) so pricing it about $6 plus another $0.50 if you'd like bubbles (tapioca pearls), jelly, etc), but they have lots of options.  I tried one  that just opened in March 2017, across the street but that had modern furniture, modern design. But didn't have bubbles available, had to wait forever. So until I find a better one, Hot Point Fusion it is."}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions now. The food is mediocre at best. The broth hasn't had time to cook enough for flavors to come out. Seems like they just throw everything in and hopes the fire cooks it at your table. Most of the broth taste like water with instant noodle seasoning.  As for service, there is no real service. Once your order is in, they ignore you till you pay. To place a order, you mark it on the sheet. Try not to order too many thing because they WILL FORGET! They don't realize they forgotten your order until you see other tables already finished being served. That's when you question them if they even put in the order and they don't even know. Truly ZERO attention to detail."}
{"text":"Their hotspots are amazing!!! But one thing would be that their chair and the table seems unclean"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this isn't the first time I've been here. But it will most likely be the last. After dinner, my friends and I decided to get some dessert from this place since they serve patbingsu (a korean dessert) and my friends raved about how great they were. I've only been here twice for hotpot, but today I opted for the dessert to share with friends. Now here's where it pretty much goes downhill even before we get our food.  We wanted to order two desserts to share amongst the four of us, HOWEVER, when the waiter came to take our order, he said we weren't allowed to order JUST dessert. Apparently the manager of the restaurant implemented a (stupid) policy about how customers MUST order either hot pot or a drink PER PERSON before they can order ANYTHING ELSE on the menu. Now I know what you're thinking. What kind of person trying to run a restaurant force customers to order something they don't want so that they can order other things off the menu?! We immediately felt appalled by such demanding and absurd actions the manager would take in order to force people into spending more money. Well unfortunately for him, the policy drives customers away, and will easily make people spend their money elsewhere in a better restaurant that WILL take their money regardless.   My friends and I were furious about the idea that the manager/owner would stoop so low, that we wanted to speak to him ourselves. Our waiter said that he wasn't available to speak with us on the phone, but didn't give us a reason why. To be quite frank, if a customer wants to speak to the manager and they refuse to do so, that just shows a reflection of how terrible the place is being managed.   So our waiter told us to talk to his co-worker, another fellow waitress. She said the same exact thing he did, and I told her that we would stand up and leave the restaurant right now if they didn't want our money to be spent there. So she gave us an alternative solution: buy whatever dessert we wanted, and pay an extra $4.45 charge. For no reason. So basically we'll be buying  what we want but spend extra money on... nothing. I asked her if anyone has ever complained about this absurd policy, and she had the audacity to say no, even though my friend came there before and knew about the policy. We did know about the policy ahead of time, but my other friend assured us they took it down and it wasn't like that the last time she went. Bad service, misinformed employees, and terrible management. And that's only the half of it.   My friends and I, still upset over the whole dessert fiasco, opted for drinks instead since we were already there and didnt want to look for another place elsewhere. Mind you, they do not include the toppings in their prices, so its an extra charge of $0.75 for jelly (which is pretty steep considering most bubble tea places charge $0.25 or give it for free). So I ordered the ferrero rocher slushy drink and the waiter comes to deliver my drink. He said, \"chocolate brownie slushy\" and I told him that's not what I ordered. So a few seconds later, he goes back to the counter, and guess what?! He returns with THE SAME drink. BUT WAIT - it comes with a different name. The drinks were heavy on the ice, very diluted, and tasted powdery. It was just bland drinks made of powder and ice straight from the blender. Nothing special, yet highly overpriced for bubble tea.   Overall, if you are in need of trying their dessert, or any other items on their menu that is not hot pot or drinks, please, SAVE YOURSELVES. We argued for over 20 minutes with the waiters and that got us nowhere. We will be contacting the manager tomorrow to speak about this dreaded policy, and hopefully this will save other customers form experiencing the same dread we experienced today. Till then, please please PLEASE spend your money elsewhere. It was not worth the time or energy to eat or drink here."}
{"text":"This place is just about 2 stars.. I don't get the other \"great\" reviews about the place. They are only just getting about 2 stars because their Milk Tea is one of my favourites bbts in Calgary. THEY LACK IN SERVICE. I once had to ask the waitress 6 times for a glass of water and the restaurant probably had 3/ 4 tables with people...AND even after tipping them for their horrible service.. THEY STILL HAD THE NERVE TO ASK FOR ANOTHER TIP!!  NEVER coming back in for dine-in JUST take out!"}
{"text":"Found a long brown hair in my soup and might I add. It's definitely not any of my group members' hairs. Quite disgusted actually. Then the girls snicker and talk crap about you behind your back just because you tell them about it. So classy . Would NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Located on MacLeod Trail, Hot Point is a typical bubble tea-based restaurant that also serves hotpot, snacks, and dessert.  AMBIENCE/SERVICE: This place feels like Destination before they closed down, except it smells like hot pot gas and burnt hot pots. Nothing special to say about the servers. 1.5/2.5  FOOD: I ordered the green bean red bean ice milk smoothie (~$5), and it had no sign of actual green or red beans in it. No problem, the drink itself was not bad. We got 4 appetizers: Taiwanese fried chicken, Curry fish balls, Japanese dumplings (gyoza), and original egg puffs. These would be fine if they were $3.99, even $4.99, but they were $6.99 each. The portions were small and the quality was even worse. The gyoza tasted worse than store-bought frozen dumplings, and were even a bit burnt. The egg puffs were chewy and not crispy. The Taiwanese fried chicken and the curry fish balls were fine, but they are impossible to mess up and taste pretty much the same everywhere. My friends each got a bowl of noodle soup, which was actually a decent portion, but they both thought everything was not worth what they paid for. Total for 3 was $63 before tip. 0.5/2.5"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, cheap food, and helpful service. Will be back very soon.  This place is great. We got a table for 2 and ordered 2 bubble teas, 2 mini hot pots and a chicken appetizer.  The selection of bubble tea wasn't huge, but they pretty much have everything you could want, plus some interesting and tasteful takes on classics. I had the Earl Grey milk tea with pearls. The earl grey added a nice kick to your run of the mill milky tea.   We got a curry fishball and a seafood mini hot pot. Everything is cooked beforehand and the fire underneath is just to keep the food nice and hot, so you don't to worry about food poisoning. The servers were glad to give us more fuel once we ran out. The portions are generous and you get plenty of meat, not just filler.  Patrons help themselves to a choice of 3 different sauces. We picked a garlic soy sauce and a chilli sauce. Both soups were fairly flavourful to begin with, but the sauces keep things interesting.  We got these popcorn chicken things as appetizers. They were pretty good, but quite salty. They make sure not to throw in weird bits, so you don't have to worry about getting a gullet or chicken brain or something.  The whole bill ran us about $35 with tip. VERY reasonable for the amount of food / drink we got.  The service is good; typical Asian place. The staff are eager to help and and friendly. Don't expect a Western style of service and you won't be disappointed. Not every place is a 4 star French restaurant. Get over it =P  Only complaint: The food took a little while getting out (about 15 minutes), even considering the fact that they pre-cooked all the stuff in the hot pot."}
{"text":"One star for their drinks which are good but prices are steep. Price is actually too steep for their customer service. Went there once, will never go back there again. Server was rude!"}
{"text":"The bubble teas are great but the prices for the quantity of food isnt so great. The food didn't taste as good as I expected and the service was really poor to begin with but i waited twice as long for what i ordered. I waited around 30 minutes for just my bubble tea and they had my order wrong the first time and when i ordered more meat it took even longer."}
{"text":"We just came here and we are group of 3. We used to come here a lot if we crave for a cheap and mediocre hot pot. But our visit here today is one of horrible experience i got among all the restaurants that i went to. First of all, the food is very SALTY and very spicy. Im not a person who is very sensitive to spicyness, In fact i always add habanero or chili flakes or hot sauce on my food but this one is not edible at all! After paying the bill, the lady told me if she did something bad to us because we didnt give any tip! I told her theres no problem with your service it is the food that has a problem. She said its obligatory to give minimum 10% tip and that if i dont give any tip she will have to pay the kitchen for the food we ate.. i dont get this logic! As far as i know, Tip giving is a sign of gratitude and appreciation for a good food or a good service, But this one is not right. This never happened to me even in a fine dining restaurant its never happening.. I finally gave her tip eventhough its not worth it, But when we ask for a take out container she asked me to pay extra $2.00 to ask for a container! i told her okay, just give me plastic bag atleast? she said NO because i need to pay for it. She said theres a different price for take out and dine in.. but this is just a left over that we ate for dine in.. We just walked out and took back my tip that i was suppose to leave in table.. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!!! no wonder restaurant was empty during their Lunch Special offer!! If i can only give -1 for the stars i wouldnt have a second thought!!"}
{"text":"The owner and the service is terrible! Shaking my head.after a terrible service they insist that you must give a tip.wow the nerve"}
{"text":"Hot Point is a Taiwanese fusion teahouse with a vast menu of hot and cold teas, shaved ices, snacks and hot pots located in the South. The selections are Taiwanese and HK favourites, most of them fairly common like crispy salt chicken, thick dessert toast and dumplings. They also have a few types of hotpot available, served in individual size, perfect for sharing.  The dining area is spacious and modern, sporting clean lines and contemporary lighting. The long wall is adorned with artwork that is reminiscent of cells from a cartoon which is interesting to look at and connects the long back area with the more open front area around the bar. Seats are large and comfortable leather-look with chrome accents. The tables are clean and spacious, perfect for hanging out with your laptop and enjoying the free wifi.  The food here is good, but not out of the ordinary. Upon hearing the word 'Taiwanese', I was expecting more menu selection to reflect the unique and interesting food you would find in Taiwan like gua bao, shao long bao or coffin bread. The hotpots are an interesting offering as they are sized for individual servings. The varieties on hand are good, which means you could bring your friends, order 3 and share away. There are house made sauces available as well that you can serve yourself.  The broth for the hotpots are ok, but nothing spectacular. They remind me of the type of soup you can make at home. The vegetables broth is a touch sweet and you can taste the hint of ketchup. The soups themselves are hearty and full of vegetables and thinly sliced meats, depending on your choice. Upon service, the hotpots are lit. The fuel underneath the vessels are not adjustable so what you have initially is a small tabletop bonfire that slowly ebbs to a steady flicker so be careful if you're dining with your kids.  I think that Hot Point would be a great place to gather for a late night snack after night of drinking. The food is decently priced, hot and will fill the gap for casual late night munchies. As for selections, they're fair. If you're looking for a full-on dinner experience for your group, Seoul next door would be more fitting."}
{"text":"Decent bubble tea, but you have to ask which ones are the bubble teas. Don't make the same mistake I did, which was order something from the shaved ice section and ask for extra boba. The tip-off should've been the quirked eyebrow I received from the waitress, but being wiped from the day made me less cognizant and therefore, more prone to receiving things such as:  A receptacle the size of a toilet bowl, filled with shaved ice and layers of mango jelly rectangles, lychee strands and boba pearls.   When I posted the photo on my instagram feed, someone asked me why I thought something that looked like a bowl of cheese, fish eggs and gravy on top of mashed potatoes would be a drink.  It was still good, though.  Came here again today, this time, I got a proper bubble tea with lychee jelly strands instead of bobas. My brother also convinced me to order a hot pot soup, so I ordered their veggie \"health soup.\" The broth was pretty bland, and could've been vastly improved with a couple of splashes of soy sauce and sriracha, but I did enjoy the assortment of veggies and bean curd skin. Solid 3, Hot Point."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and the service is terrible. It took 30 minutes to get our order and over an hour to get our drinks. First time we came here for the hot pot. It was okay a bit to salty for my taste.   Today we came for bbt and dessert. When we went to the counter to order the told us there were no shaved ice desserts or thick toast desserts.....that's half there menu. We ended up just having bbt what a waste of time. They should let people know or not open if they don't have any food. I would not come back ."}
{"text":"Horrendous food. Just beyond saving. Noodles not cooked and broth is basically water. Possibly the worst meal I've ever had in a restaurant. Service was OK. Tables were dirty. Avoid."}
{"text":"Horrible bubble tea.... They told me because it's half sugar so there won't be any taste?   Green bean slush without green bean, red bean slush without red bean? You are using powder so there is no taste? After i asked them about the bean they told me because i chose them from the powder section so it wont have any actual sight of bean or taste... What? How expensive are the beans? And seriously, how can you mess this up?  And i i quire more about how slushes tasted like water and to he honest, horrible. They told me because i chose the half sugar option so there won't be much taste......WHAT??? Sugar and flavor are two different thing... Worst bubble tea ever  They even delivered me the wrong drink and called it the wrong name...  The cheapest bubble tea place in Taiwan will taste way better than this place   Do yourself a favorite, avoid this place and save your hard earned cash somewhere else  I will not come back again"}
{"text":"Came in to get a some bbt with friends. as soon as we went on the place smelled horrible, sort of like the stuff you use to clean the washroom with. We got our bbt and they were all terrible. Too watery and tasteless. My friend ordered a fresh mango bbt and it tasted like fish/sushi. It is also way overpriced for what it is. Not going to be coming back."}
{"text":"Good place to talk and amazing bubbletea! Snacks were delicious as well! But wouldnt suggest the seafood hot pot, not clean and not fresh. My boyfriend and i all got stomachaches aftwards."}
{"text":"The reason for this being a 1 star is because of the service we got at the end of the night. We came in with our family. 4 Adults and a 13 month old baby (whom did not eat a single thing) at the end when we paid for the bill we were charged an automatic 15% gratuity because there were apparently 5 people at the table (them counting a 13 month old baby as a person) which made no complete sense because they in no way \"served\" the baby. If there were 5 adults at the table, I would completely understand. I have been coming here so many times and I have never had to deal with this. They had the audacity to argue it as well saying \"well we still served you\". Well yeah, they did serve us but not the baby. They didn't even ask us if we needed a high chair, or brought a cup of water for the baby as they brought one for everyone else at the table. Just lost a couple of regulars. Not sorry."}
{"text":"To cap off a day of eating, we decided to check out Hot Point Fusion Cafe. My friend has been there multiple times - it seems like a pretty chill place to go to after shopping/movie/dinner or for some late night eats. The place is huge and there are a ton of booths to sit at, aka. perfect for a group hangout. The menu is absolutely massive with every type of drink you can think of. Too many choices!  A lot of people were ordering mini hot pots. Seems reasonably cheap but not sure how good it is taste wise. Based on all the reviews I read, come in with low expectations for their food. My friend told me not to bother with their shaved ice (plus it takes 20-30 minutes to make) leaving us with the sole decision of what to drink. Easy peasy.  - Fresh avocado/mango and fresh watermelon ice slush ($6.25 each) - I went with avocado and mango with grass jelly (extra $0.75) and my friend with the watermelon ice slush with lychee pieces. The avocado tasted fresh and had a nice creamy texture to it. Tough to find a place that makes avocado bubble tea well. I was pleasantly surprised. My friend's watermelon was also quite good, a bit more on the watery/icy side as that is how it generally goes with watermelon drinks.  All in all, I was pretty happy with the drinks. Staff was decent - you just go up and pay when you're done, don't see what all the fuss is about with poor service. Maybe it's an issue when they're busy? Anyways, I like it and I will be back if I'm in the area and craving some BBT."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe a bit biased after almost a week working there, my first real hip, funky trendy asian bubble tea venue where one can feel safe and authentic lol.  High ceilings, pretty spacious, almost like a club-like atmosphere, and good service with, english-speaking servers too.  though i only ordered the blueberry smoothie with no pearls and sugar, was quite fresh and smooth.  Their taiwanese hot pot and thick french toast are their signature choices, next time when i'm in town.  Probably the best seating is their L-shape booth in the very back, their only one.  Very clean and spacious bathrooms too."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and it's really good! I wasn't too much of a fan of the hot pot, but it was good nonetheless. But you have to try the shaved ice here because it's amazing! The portion sizes are huge and the only downside with the shaved ice is that you have to order a drink. But definitely a worth trying, I got the mango shaved ice and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here once in a while when we want a quick hot soup.    Good food at a good price.    We have tried the beef hot soup, kimchi hot soup, tofu seaweed hot soup, hot and sour lamb hot soup, and a few appetizers. The bubble tea menu is extensive and not to be missed!  Parking can be tight due to the gym next door, but we usually find a spot right outside."}
{"text":"Really hits the spot for late night dining.   Bubble tea and other milk teas are available.   The hot pot is great as well as the beef noodle soups.   Good place to hang out or chill after movies or sporting event.  I usually get uji macha milk tea."}
{"text":"Asian/Taiwanese cafe in the South! wooo hooo! So yes they are asian servers...  so expect what you expect.  $8.99 individual hot pots.... haven't tried but will definitely try soon.  They serve: bubble teas/slushies Shaved ice desserts THICK dessert toasts  open layout on inside.  one bad thing is that if you're not eating a hot pot then as a minimum you are required to order a drink for each person plus one menu item ... kind of a stupid rule i think...."}
{"text":"I have to say I've tried this place 3 times before I've decided to write this review. The food okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. Bubble teas pretty typical. The hot pots okay. But it's not hard to make hop pot at home either. With it being a hot pot place you do tend to smell gas even though they only use a canister that lights up with a lighter with gel with a wok light dish on top.  What really irritates me is the service. They pretty much aren't ware of you there. When they do sit you down they seem to forget. Tonight experience was really irritating. There was only about 5 or 6 tables. Not a very busy night. We did get seated for one. Usually the hot pot comes with a bowl of rice. Maybe it's me but i'm use to having rice and asked for it. Guy knowledge it and went to doing his duties. Waited and waited...I thought they maybe forgot about it. Waved down the girl to ask for rice. She knowledge it and went back to whatever she was doing also. I got irritated. If you don't have it then simple to say we don't have it. Finally we just finish eating what's in the pot and pay. Left and wasn't pleased at all.   This would probably be the last time I would go back and give it a try. Previously we just went to the Korean restaurant literally two stores down and had hot pot there instead. Still hot pot and service is a bit better."}
{"text":"I've come to Hot Point many times and have tried several of their drinks, their signature hot pots, and snacks. First of all they have a minimum one drink per person order and for some reason snacks don't count. You could not order, for example, one drink and a snack between two people. I don't understand this because the food costs at least as much as most of their drinks. Every single one of the milk teas I've had here are disappointing. They're all watery or too sweet with no tea flavour. The fruit slushies are definitely better. There is only one vegetarian hot pot which is also marketed as the healthy option. It's not bad but i can see how it's the healthy option because the broth is basically water+ tomato paste and it has some random veggies in it. The other hot pots, especially the milk broth ones are apparently very good. The snacks I've had are alright, but nothing special. Overall, I feel like if you want food you should go to Seoul next door and if you want bubble tea then go to 3Q across Macleod."}
{"text":"I live really close to this place so it's one of those places I always call when I don't feel like cooking and I want to get a quick meal without breaking the bank. The atmosphere here is very relaxed and very clean looking. They offer a variety of appetizers, hot soups, milk teas/slush and thick toast for dessert.  For the hot pot, I've only tried the beef hot soup and milk hot soup. The broth of the beef hot soup is very flavorful. They mark is as spicy but to me it just has that right amount of kick. The milk hot soup can probably use a little bit more salt for flavor. Also, their broth is a little too oily for my taste. The dipping sauces are also really good but they leave your mouth tasting garlic/ginger even after a gargle/brush.  Their signature milk tea (with pearls)is good but I would recommend ordering it without the whipped cream. If signature milk tea is not available, go for the red milk tea as it tastes really close to signature. I would also recommend the uji macha red bean milk smoothie (add red bean to it) as it tastes close to green tea ice cream.  I guess one thing this place can improve on is their service. They serve your food pretty quick but some of the servers are not yet comfortable with English so it's sometimes hard to communicate our orders or requests."}
{"text":"I was really craving soup last night so my girlfriend suggested that we go to Hot Point Fusion Cafe. It was my first hot pot experience and it was a good one. We had the Beef Hot Soup and added wide vermicelli noodles and kimchi to it. We also had an order of curry fish balls and chicken wings. The wings were a bit plain and just had a tempura batter but they were cooked to absolute perfection. I will definitely be back here and I can't wait to try a more traditional hot pot experience after this introduction."}
