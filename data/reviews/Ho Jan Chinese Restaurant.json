{"text":"Price: 3 / 5 ($10 per lunch special)

They just raised their price recently. It's on par with restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Could I give less stars? Do not, do not, do not and may I repeat! Do not go here! The food is horrible there are no customers and staff are sitting around socializing with each other and aside from that there is no music to even try to create a little ambiance. My worst experience  in any downtown restaurant  by far."}
{"text":"Authenticity: It's authentic for the most part.

Food: It's alright, I usually get an order of the dry fried beef ho fan. Their dimsum's are mediocre but they serve it all day!  Portions are good and price is fair."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic dim sum, friendly efficient service. Simple decor, nothing fancy. But i like the place and will return for more."}
{"text":"Had a very nice dinner here the other night.  The food is authentic and the service is friendly and efficient.  Ordered the spicy deep fried grouper, sweet and sour pork, mixed vegetables, and chow mein.  The food came out quickly and the portion sizes were very good.  The spicy grouper was delicious, deep fried with the right amount of heat.  I will definitely be back the next time I have a craving for chinese food."}
{"text":"Came here for Dim Sum after the Cora's next door was really full. The pork buns were delicious, as was the sticky rice. The chicken and corn soup was really unappetising. Otherwise, good portion sizes, nice clean restaurant and great service."}
{"text":"Went here last night because we were in the mood for Dim Sum, and the sign outside advertises \"all day dim sum\".

The dim sum selection was small, but had most of the more popular items. We had steamed bbq pork buns and siu mai. From the regular menu we had udon noodles with beef and black bean sauce and general tso's chicken.

Both the noodles and the chicken were a little spicier than we expected, and the noodles were pretty dry and had a generous amount of black pepper. The dim sum was pretty much normal, not amazing but good.

The meal overall was decent, and it was relatively inexpensive - all of the above came to $29. We'll probably be back next time we want dim sum and don't feel like hoofing it over to Chinatown."}
{"text":"We've tried all the nice dim sum places around the GTA (Dynasty, Crown Princess, Lai Wah Heen, heck even Emerald Castle in Mississauga) and we like this one the best! It doesn't have as much selection but they have my favourites and they're all delicious. Har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, etc. As another reviewer mentioned, they have a dim sum \"special\" which is a great deal, the service was efficient and friendly whenever we went, it's never too crowded AND the bathrooms are super nice. That last point had me sold on this place.
In the end, it's a convenient downtown location, yummy food, clean/quiet for a chinese restaurant. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"What makes this place great is their family meal specials - for the 4 item dinner, which includes 4 spring rolls, 4 soups (hot and sour or chicken and corn soup, both of which are pretty flavourless, but good on a cold day), you'll pay about $43 and it'll feed two people for at least 3 meals.  All-in-all, the food is of average quality, but you'll get your Chinese food fix when you're craving it.  The deep fried grouper is yummy (though a tad salty), as is the eggplant with pork (which is lacking salt...hmm).  If you don't mind blandness, the cashew chicken is a healthy option, as is the kung po chicken (a little more zing in that one).  

Nothing extraordinary, but the prices are pretty darn good and it works for a quick last minute dinner."}
{"text":"I've never known anyone to mess up wonton soup but these guys completely desecrated it. Problems: 1) they used udon noodles 2) flavorless broth (more bland than normal wonton soup, I was basically drinking hot water) 3) the wonton was all wrapper (we're taking a protein amount the size of my finger tip) 4) THE STUFFING WAS MADE OF PORK (everyone knows wontons are shrimp based). I would give this place no stars if I could but that's not an option. They basically just looked at thousands of years of chinese history and wiped their butts with the wonton soup recipe page. It's not even sad, it's just disrespectful what they're labeling as \"wonton noodle soup\"."}
{"text":"Wasn't great, didn't suck. It was raining out and this place was across the street from my Hotel. Wasn't expensive either. It was a place to eat.
Next!"}
{"text":"We enjoy going to Ho Jan so much. Its hard to find a Chinese restaurant sometimes that makes it, the way you like it. We are fortunate to have discovered Ho Jan. All of their dishes are made fresh to order. They have an excellent selection on their menu.

I love their Cantonese chow mein, and their siu mai dumplings.

Their pricing is good. And the servers there are so nice and sweet.

I highly recommend going to Ho Jan!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch as I had intense cravings for chow mein but don't know of that many places outside of Chinatown in the downtown core that has chow mein.  I've been spoiled by great, authentic and cheap Chinese food uptown so clearly my standards are kind of high.  

I ordered the beef and vegetable chow mein which cost $12 - they have a lunch special menu for under $10 but theres no chow mein on it.   The beef chow mein was good but despite it looking big on the plate the portions were small compared to uptown portions. 

Overall the food and service was good but a bit on the pricier side. I'd come back the next time I'm dt and am looking for something close by. However, this would not be my preferred location for authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Really good if you know what to get. CHICKEN ALMOND SOO GAI is very good. high quality chicken and big portion. basically all of their chicken dishes are great. i am sure they have other great dishes but i don't know what they are. some of their dishes (kung po chicken) are not great (personal taste, it might be good to others or maybe it was a bad day) but i just don't order them anymore. 

overall, this is a great restaurant. they really take pride in their food and customers."}
{"text":"Being the closest Chinese restaurant to my place, I head here whenever I'm in the mood for a bit of dirty Chinese. I always get the family special, which includes a spring roll, soup and main dish for $15, which is enough food to last me 2 meals. The food is pretty westernised (just the way I like it) and the spring rolls are my absolute fave! Crispy on the outside and soo yum. I also like that they put a piece of cardboard in the bottom of the plastic take out bag so the food inside doesn't tip and spill. The prices are pretty reasonable - around $11.50 for a main - although some of the seafood dishes can be anywhere up to $27. You get 10% off when your order take-away too, so that's a bonus point. The food isn't amazing by any means, but it gets the job done. I'm glad to have this restaurant so close to me!"}
{"text":"Was sort of expected it to be a little cheaper then it was, with dishes under 10$ but everything is basically 10-15$. Clean bathroom, service friendly but neglectful, but not nice decor. Asked for the cheque, then got forgotten for 20 minutes then asked again and got the cheque a couple mins later.

Had Sesame Chicken & Dim Sum Combo. Thought the food was all adequate, but nothing was particularly good. Ingredients tasted fresh and I'd describe as typical tastes. Would consider going back, but wouldn't pick this out"}
{"text":"I live across the street from here, but I havent gone until recently as I usually just walk to Spadina. They're not that great, but not inedible. Their dim sum menu is not very extensive but it's what I was craving. I havent tried their rice or noodle or meat dishes that others seem to enjoy, so if I ever so come back this will probably need an update LOL"}
{"text":"Landed here on a cold winter's night at 7:30pm... Rather sparsely decorated or rather the lack of decor that seems to be the approach typical of some chinese restos, especially those in smaller cities and towns.  It's like function is more important than style.  I had an uncle who ran a Chinese Canadian Cafe in a small town and he didn't update it EVER in the 20+ years he owned it.  Anyways I digress... 

Typical menu that adjusts the ingredients to meet Canadian preferences.  For example, the wonton soup with noodles came with udon noodles and button mushrooms and broccoli and slices of carrot. Some weird Fusion Asian soup.  Not what you would find in an authentic resto but seems to meet the needs of the local demographic.     The table next to us wanted food that wasn't spicy and wouldn't break their teeth because they are old.  Yes that is exactly what they said with a straight face!

Service is friendly and the veggie fried rice and chinese broccoli were good.  Good place for a quick simple meal if that's all you want."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and always leave with a satisfied belly.  'Nuff said!"}
{"text":"On a weekday around 10, my boyfriend and I were pretty weary from a long journey and hungry for good food. As soon as we checked into our hotel, we ventured out into the unfamiliar city without consulting my trustworthy fellow Yelpers, which was a bad bad idea.

After walking seemingly for an eternity and a half in vain, the red lanterns and \"all day dim sum\" sign lured us in. The restaurant was pretty empty; we sat down by the windows, perused the menu (with the smallest selection of dim sum dishes), and ordered a small cup of crab and corn soup, braised tofu with vegetables, and seafood fried noodles.

The soup was a wee bit salty but decent (appeared to have real crab instead of the infamous Krab meat). It was so nice to finally have some food in the stomach. The braised tofu dish didn't look like anything I had imagined: big squares of deep-fried tofu stir-fried with some vegetables in light-flavoured sauce. I didn't mind the vegetables and the sauce, but the quality of the tofu was pretty disappointing. The seafood noodle dish was not too impressive either.

We were so hungry, so we ate both dishes begrudgingly. The service was the only saving grace as it was friendly and courteous. This was a very disappointing dining experience for us. :-("}
{"text":"Good Chinese restaurant in Toronto's Church & Wellesley village.  Food is okay with the exception of the Lo Mein noodles which are flavorless and flimsy compared to the Lo Mein I've eaten in the U.S. (Lo Mein in the States uses thicker noodles, similar to Shanghai Noodles where as in Canada vermicelli is used instead).  Dim sum, appetizers and all other menu items are good, and waiter service is decent.  As one of te few, non-chain Chinese restaurants in the area, it provides a nice change from all the fast food, Thai, and sandwich shops in the vicinity.  Close to the College subway station, the restaurant is across the street from the large Loblaw's at the Maple Leaf Centre. Tends to get busy on weekends and some evenings during the week."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Chinese food, and this place was the closest to our house.  The menu outside looked good and decently priced.  We went inside and took a seat near the window.  There were maybe 2 other tables there; it was pretty empty.

It took a really long time for us to get menus which didn't start things off right.  We looked over the menu for a few minutes and had decided what to get.  We waited....and waited...and waited for someone to come to our table to take our order, or even as if we wanted anything to drink.  It looked like two people were working.  The woman was busy on the phone, and going in and out of the kitchen.  The man was mainly watching TV or on the computer.  We waited so long that someone literally came in from outside, ordered something to go and got his food before anyone had even come to take our order.  No joke!  By this point I was livid and we walked out of the place.  It was absolutely inexcusable how bad the service was.

Their menu looked tempting though, and the prices were good, so I wanted to give them a second chance and try the delivery option.  We ordered from the Special Family Meal which came with one of 38 dishes along with soup and a spring roll for each dish you ordered.  Unfortunately you could only order Hot & Sour soup or the Chicken & Sweet Corn Soup.  I prefer Wonton Soup and was told I could not substitute.  The spring rolls were average.  We ordered the lemon chicken, beef with mixed vegetables and chicken fried rice.  I was surprised that white rice was extra.  There was a lot of food, so our stomachs were definitely full, and there was lots left over.  It was pretty average food though.  Nothing to rave about.

I would order delivery or take out again because the price is pretty good.  Take out is 10% off too, which is a plus, especially since I live close."}
{"text":"Food was just average and way too expensive for what we got. Sweet and sour chicken was advertised as breaded chicken with pineapple and sweet/sour sauce. When we opened it, half the container was green pepper. 

Order was sweet and sour chicken, small hot and sour soup and order of crispy won tons. The total came to $35. Maybe acceptable if we had it delivered but this was pickup. 

Next time I am in Toronto, I will find another option. There are plenty around. 

Disappointed......."}
{"text":"So let me just say I completely goofed on my order when I ate here. I ordered the House Fried Rice; where I come from, House Fried Rice is really just veggie rice.  Out comes this dish full of beef and shrimp with the tofu and pineapple I added to what I thought I was getting initially.

The server was very apologetic (even though it was completely my fault) and brought out another dish right away.  The food was magnificent and they were so friendly to us.  Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"After checking in at the Holiday Inn across the street, my mom and I decided we were hungry  (since we didn't eat before our flight - I've got a nervous stomach).  We saw this little restaurant advertising \"All Day Dim Sum\", and since we love dim sum, we headed on over.

The restaurant is small, and very cute.  Probably only seats about 30 or 40 people, if that.  There are signs advertising the specials around the store, written in marker on posterboard.  I love that.  Gives it kind of a more home-y feel, rather than some super-polished thing.

We both decided on the dim sum combo, which was hot & sour soup (I substituted chicken corn soup, but both soups were fantastic), spring roll, har gow, siu mai, steamed bbq pork buns, and sticky rice with chicken wrapped up in a lotus leaf.  Everything was delicious, and the cost was quite good.  I was going to try to list my favorites, but I can't.  Everything tasted tasty.

I think our total ended up being just under $20.  It was a nice little surprise to have this little gem across the street from our hotel."}
{"text":"Not bad for dinner time.  The lobster was small but tasty.   The Hai cau was pretty good. Their beef noddle lacked flavor n not very good."}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food so checked Yelp and this restaurant came up. Originally being from uptown, this place is way way too expensive for what it serves. We ordered typically cheap dishes but here it wasn't cheap. We ordered Shrimp fried rice ($11.99) and Singaporean style vermicelli ($12.49). Relatively small portions for the price but both dishes were pretty tasty. Mind you, my Chinese husband said the food was alright. The fried rice was fresh, lots of egg and lots of shrimp. The noodles were cooked well, a bit dry but well seasoned. If I was desperate and not willing to walk 20-30 min to Chinatown, then I might try this place again. 

Plus, the lady owner is HILARIOUS. Everytime she passed our table, she was looking for something to clean up. I was finishing up the last bits of the noodles and she was literally pulling the plate from under my spoon and fork. Is she in a hurry or something?  We were 1 of 3 tables filled of the entire restaurant. If I wasn't so amused, then I would be really peeved. It is a bit rude to swipe the plate from under where you're eating right?"}
{"text":"Funny how things change. 

Once upon a time, a review of Ho Jan would likely have started by mentioning their location smack dab between Maple Leaf Gardens and the Eatons department store at College Park.

Now Maple leaf Gardens is a Loblaws and Ryerson's gym, and Eatons has been replaced by Winners and a slew of government offices. 

I don't think that Ho Jan was around back when. I don't fully understand how they're around right now, unless they do bang-up takeout business. The place is always mostly empty, which is a good thing if you're in the mood for a sit-down meal over a tight lunch hour. Also good since it's just far enough off the beaten path that I'm unlikely to run into my co-workers. I like them, but the 8 hours we spend together is enough for me, most days. 

I often complain how difficult it has become to find decent, old school, local Chinese restaurants. Ho Jan fills that void. Lunch specials recently shot up from $9 to $10, but it's still a fair deal for a small bowl of soup and an entrée. 

Soup choices are limited to corn or veggie hot and sour. I usually opt for the latter; it's deeply flavoured, with a smattering of veg and just enough heat and acid to keep you interested. it's also not cloyingly sweet. Corn soup is fine, but one-note in the way that all lunch special corn soup is...the bigger issue with both bowls is the likelihood that you will encounter an insufficiently-dissolved glob of corn starch, which during cold season may make you wonder whether someone sneezed in the pot. 

Menu items vary from OK to pretty good. Portions are huge, and invariably involve a decent amount of protein, thick sauce, and a bed of medium-hot rice. I've had the General Tso and Chilli chicken, and don't think I could distinguish between them; both battered hunks of meat, a surfeit of hot-raw onion, and a sauce that owes more to sugar than to spice. Still, on a cold day with a growling stomach it's just what the doctor ordered. 

Beef in black bean sauce is surprisingly good. Tender beef, rich brown sauce strewn with fermented beans; more onions and a green pepper or too. Mapo Tofu and a spicy eggplant dish are even better; warming and porky; a freer hand with the chillies makes them worth coming back to. 

If you're really hungry, order a plate of noodles-easily more than enough for one. Singapore noodles include actual slivers of bbq pork and full shrimp cooked just to popping. 

Ho Jan offers a daily Dim Sum special, too-a bowl of soup and an assortment of dumplings, plus sticky rice. If you're a Dim Sum addict and can't make your way over to Spadina and back to the office in time, go ahead-otherwise give it a pass; it's nothing special. 

Service warms up with repeat visits. Tea is offered and refilled promptly. 

Ho Jan may not be the fanciest, most authentic or even 'best' Chinese food in the city, but I appreciate it. Other attractions nearby have faded, but what's left is the kind of Chinese restaurant I hope always has a place downtown."}
{"text":"Ho Jan brings back memories of a clean Chinatown restaurant in the 80's.  I have had dinner here twice.  The dishes are authentic Cantonese cooking.  The ingredients are sufficiently fresh.  The dishes are relatively salty by today's standard, but they are the typical food back in the 80's.  This restaurant so lives in the past that it is borderline awesome.  I feel like walking in a movie set or a time machine.

As it is the only Chinese restaurant within walking distance (this is an important point as parking is hard and expensive around here), it has good business from both Chinese and non-Chinese.   

I normally would have given it 2.5 stars. Being a sucker of nostalgia, solid 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Food and prices are average for a Chinese restaurant (cheap for a restaurant overall). Staff are pretty friendly though. Lunch specials are cheap."}
{"text":"I definitely would not recommend this place. I ordered a soft drink, a soup and chicken fried rice. The cheque would have been almost $20 for this basic meal. I asked to add mushrooms to the fried rice and the waitress proceeded to tell me it would be a $5 additional charge. I've been to many Chinese restaurants and it is usually $1 and sometimes $2.  I don't mean to sound cheap or petty, but when you pay $11 for the chicken fried rice, which includes many vegetables, rice and chicken it should not be $5 to add a couple mushrooms. 

I found a Chinese restaurant up the street with better service, better food and they don't cheat their customers."}
