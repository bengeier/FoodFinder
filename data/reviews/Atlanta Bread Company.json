{"text":"Minimal bagel selection on a Sunday morning was disappointing."}
{"text":"Bleh.  Atlanta Bread Company is one of those trendy \"fast-casual\" sandwich shops that were a big deal about five years ago.  Subpar soups, okay sandwiches, but by no means worth making a special trip.  The best thing I've had there was a chicken pesto panini, but even that was simply average.  I can't imagine anybody would be excited to go here; the menu is very simple and the food doesn't even live up to its low expectations.  The decor is nice but the restaurant itself is far too large.  The last few times I've gone there have only been a few other tables occupied.  The call-out-your-number style of picking up your food seems unnecessary given the usual amount of customers; I think it would be an improvement if they took the food out to you ala Noodles & Company.  The bakery is expansive but mediocre.  The cookies are large but I could make better at home.  I haven't tried much else from the bakery (I'm too eager to leave) but I have no real desire to return.  Final verdict: Not bad, but don't bother."}
{"text":"I like Panera more than this place.  Their menu is not that extensive and the ambiance was just drab.  I had the chicken noodle soup which was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"the boss went out with me today for a ride along to check up on my awesome sales skills. in the path of a super busy day we needed to eat and i spied this place in the parking lot so we pulled in. this is a clean little place with plenty of seating and a very clean look. you walk up and order, pay,and then pick up at the counter. they have all kinds of sandwiches, soups, and salads + a case of baked goods and sweets. i had the balsamic blue cheese salad with chicken added. the salad had apple slices, tomatoes, walnuts, cranberry's, and mixed greens. they served the dressing on the side, it was a balsamic with raspberry, they give you two little sealed containers which is more than enough (i only used one,so if you like a lot there is plenty) they also give you a piece of fresh french bread that was also tasty. i enjoyed the salad it tasted very fresh. my boss had a classic Caesar salad with chicken and also enjoyed it (kind of hard to mess that up) all in all this is a good place to grab a quick bite. i will go back if in the neighborhood and hungry."}
{"text":"Food is great! Fresh, Hot, and Yumm! Wish I had one near me!"}
{"text":"Always has a solid, fresh menu. Go with the California avocado sandwich."}
{"text":"Not quite decided about this place. I went once with my mom, and had a great salad with apples, cranberries, and blue cheese. The soup was good too, some type of southwest chicken with rice and beans. They also have tasty cookies, and muffin tops(which is the best part, let's face it).  Recently when I went, I just ordered soup. I think it was supposed to be Chicken Enchilada or something. Disgusting. I was pissed that I paid almost five dollars for a bowl of thick, gloppy soup that tasted like someone just opened a bag of wholesale condensed nonsense.   Good thing the iced tea was decent."}
{"text":"Poopski potato. Best chicken I've ever had in the north. Props Taco Bell. It says my message is too short so now I'm just wasting space. Check out my blog at michellepoopski.blog.com and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"The actual food was good, fresh, yummy, filling...the service was pretty sad - teenage boys who don't know customer service. It is located in a snooty area near Middleton and the customers were really snitchy....but with a \"b\" - huffing and puffing in line for having to stand and wait to order - it was very reminiscent of orange county, ca, so much so that I now wonder if the residents of Middleton are mostly ex-Californians. My husband ordered one of their panini sandwiches and was told they were out of stock, he inquired as to what part they didn't have and they said....get this...\"our sandwiches are pre-made and we're out of stock on that one\"....REVELATION...hello...I don't know how this is possible, maybe just the panini, but perhaps they really do ship it daily from Atlanta! LOL They didn't do right on the order, but we were hungry and it was good...definitely NOT worth the money though, or the service. THE COOKIES ARE TO DIE FOR HOWEVER!!!"}
{"text":"It's amazing how things can go so wrong.  On a 9 a.m. visit, the first thing I noticed was that this shop offers soups, sandwiches, and salads.  I wasn't in the mood for typical breakfast items. I asked the attendant whether they were serving sandwiches.  I even pointed to sandwiches on the menu.  No, he replied, only breakfast items (bacon, sausage, or ham and egg croissants or bagels).  You can't nuke a croissant.  My $4 croissant was no better than a cheap Jimmy Dean frozen sausage croissant from the grocery store. It came with coffee that was nothing special. I pumped the coffee from dispensers that ran dry.  You get better coffee from 7-Eleven.  I noticed servers standing around the soup and salad area.  Out of curiosity, I asked if they were serving soup and sandwiches.  Yes, they serve soup, salad, and sandwiches all day.  I asked the attendant who helped me at first.  \"I thought you said you weren't serving sandwiches.\"    \"Oh no.  We serve them all day!\"  What can you do?  I spoke English and apparently he understood it.  What went wrong is anyone's guess.  My first experience here was highly negative.  It's a nice shop, however.  The attendant was friendly and pleasant. Maybe the misunderstanding was somehow all my fault.  Rather than buy anything here, pick up a cheap breakfast sandwich at the nearby Terrible's convenience store.   Or, take your chances on their soups, sandwiches, and salads. There are pretty pictures all around the shop that make the offerings look tasty."}
