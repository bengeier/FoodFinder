{"text":"Fantastic Blueberry London Fog! Tasty without being overwhelming - a perfect combination for a rainy day. Great service as well."}
{"text":"I moved to the area recently and have to work from home sometimes on the weekends, so i was looking for a place where i can work comfortably and have coffee and food that i can enjoy while working. This place is awesome with great and very friendly customer service. Food and coffee were fantastic also. There's free wifi here as well as tons of outlets for our laptops and phones (yes very important indeed). I will be coming back here all the time."}
{"text":"I honestly loved this cafe. The two waitresses working tonight were just amazing. Their energy was visible from before I even ordered. They were so bright and cheerful and I went near closing time. I ordered a matcha latte and honestly there are very few places that make it well, these guys are probably the best. I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Amazing place to get work done or chill with friends/family. I love the decor, very minimalistic/ rustic, yet modern feel. I ordered a Cajun Chicken sandwich, which so delicious and had a raspberry white hot chocolate  = amazing. Also the service was outstanding, very friendly and patient. Bonus: I got an extra pastry for free! However, the only downside is that there are limited outlets... Other than that, amazing experience overall. Would recommend and visit again!"}
{"text":"Happy to find this little gem of a cafe in Scarborough. While shops like these are popping up all over Markham,  not too many shops like it that I know of in the Scarborough area. Clean, modern vibe with comfortable seating and great drinks. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Equipt with good food, good coffee ,and great atmosphere, this is the kind of place to go for a social meet up or to just enjoy a nice brunch. Given the area this Cafe is very unique and offers a very sleek and comfortable place to fuel up on caffeine."}
{"text":"Cute, out of the way cafe in Scarborough. I got the veggie sandwich, which overall was good, though I think they should have seasoned all their vegetables; I would get some bites that we're flavorful and other times...not so much. My partner got the Cajun chicken and he said it was pretty good. Quiet, simple, and welcoming atmosphere. Also quite a few people studying here so that's cool."}
{"text":"Finally found a great cafe in Scarborough! I've been dying to find a good place in Scarborough that serves real coffee. And Black Gold is that spot! You can smell how good their beans are as soon as you walk in. The staff are friendly, the atmosphere is chill and free Wifi. I've had breakfast and lunches there already and look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the vibe in BlackGold Cafe! It gives off such a retro feel and is a great place to take some nice pictures ;) the food and drinks are really good as well! I got the Pegasus and it tasted more like lemonade than a tea. Definitely not a bad thing though! I also got the chai latte and it was so good! It had a creamy taste which I enjoyed. I recommend going here!"}
{"text":"A great little cafe with tasteful decor. The barista was very friendly and helpful.   The chocolate avalanche is awesome. The brownie is not overly sweet nor is the chocolate cupcake.   My friend enjoyed the raspberry white hot chocolate and said you can really taste the raspberry. My other friend recommended the iced matcha latte. I just got regular old tea but I felt sophisticated sipping from my giant teacup.   I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe in Scarborough. The white chocolate raspberry hot chocolate is to DIE for."}
{"text":"I come here for the coffee/teas at least once a week. It's a great cozy space for working or meeting up with company. The music is always different and gets me in a different vibe, think Queen and Pink Floyd versus hip hop.  They have non-dairy milks for those that want the alternatives, and their Pluck brand of teas are DELISH.  They only lost one star from me because I find that there are too many fruit flies by the garbage area."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance,  lots of parking in the back of the Plaza and extremely accommodating staff!  I came in at lunchtime and was appropriately hangry so it took me a while to decide what food I wanted. I settled with the Liquid Gold for a pick me upper and a cajun chicken sandwich.  Wait time for the sandwich was nit too long and the sandwich came hot! Love it when the food is freshly made. The Liquid Gold was nice, a Lil bit of sweetness on too and all espresso underneath - that powered me through a work document pretty fast.  I would not mind coming here again to do a bit of work, it's just conducive to getting things done. There's also so many snack options and even soup- was tempted to get their creamy seafood soup but alas I already had a sandwich and was too full to order another one   Wifi is pretty easy to access and reliable too. Music levels were satisfactory,  I didn't need to use my earphones to keep the noise out. It was definitely well balanced."}
{"text":"BlackGold is a quaint little Scarborough cafe with a hipster vibe. Although seating is not plentiful, it makes up for it with the various types including benches and bar-style. The area is relatively quiet with ample amounts of parking, making it a gem for cafe study-goers that aren't already at Starbucks.  The food and drinks themselves are not anything exceptional, but you are here for the wrong reasons if you are looking for a gourmet experience. They offer a decent variety of pastries and drinks with witty names.   The staff are very welcoming and professional. There was a man who walked in and did not make a purchase. Instead of shoo-ing the man out or calling for the cops (au style de Starbucks), the staff actually sat down with him and just chatted with him casually until he left; very professionally handled!  My only qualm with the establishment is the lack of recycling bins - they only offer a garbage bin. While going to the cafe translates to some waste, I believe that having the option to recycle would be an important, progressive and responsible next step for the establishment.  In short, BlackGold holds promise for those who seek a study space asylum away from the loud and rowdy while enjoying coffee and pastries."}
{"text":"Must Try: Blueberry Caramel Fog, Liquid Gold or ask for their seasonal special creations   Rating: (8/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (9/10) Value, (9/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness   My Experience:    Finally Scarborough gets an awesome cafe they deserve! This amazing spot has some great coffee and a wide selection of tea (sourced from local tea shop Pluck). The drinks are the real stand out star here, with a variety of seasonal drink creations on rotation.  While the drinks are great and unique, the food is above average. Great food but nothing beyond the normal offerings of a coffee shop. The food is always fresh, and selection is sparse by the end the of the day.   The service is always friendly and every drink is hand crafted and not rushed. There is plenty of space to sit and catch up with friends, or get your laptop out and do some work (free wifi, of course). There's plenty of parking around the plaza, so there's never a fight for a spot."}
{"text":"Came across this place on Yelp and went to check it out, amazing coffee and customer service !"}
{"text":"My favourite cafe yet! Food was good, drinks were amazing and service was exceptional!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Nothing but a positive experience! The parking lot has plenty of parking spaces since the plaza seems pretty dead. Most people here were either studying or doing work, a nice and quiet atmosphere. Other than their music blasting in the background. Staff were super friendly!   We ordered the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, Ice latte and Ice London Fog. The Cajun Chicken Sandwich took less than 10 minutes to prepare, and was super spicy! They seem generous with their ingredients. For someone who loves their drinks sweet like me, the Ice Latte was too bitter for my liking. Very strong. As for the Ice London Fog, it was perfect. It was recommended to me by one of their staff. It was strong in flavour and had the right amount of sugar.   When going up to the counter to pick up my drink, one of their staff realized he made me the wrong drink and apologized immediately. Not a big deal since we were sitting down to chat anyway. I could wait. A minute later, another one of their staff came up to apologize for the mistake and wait, and gave us a complimentary \"A Small Piece of Heaven\" pastry. It was a completely unexpected yet kind gesture, which shows how much they value customer service.  Overall, a great experience here. I will definitely be back to try their other drinks."}
{"text":"Visited them yesterday evening. Our experience was nothing like mentioned by previous reviewers. We had a cold coffee and a regular drip coffee. Both were just okay, nothing great. I believe Tim Horton's tastes better. Neither was service was better. Go-in order, take it out and leave. Maybe we had such experience as we got there 15 mins to close. Will try them again and update my review later."}
{"text":"Their drinks are good and i like how you can choose your own flavour for the iced coffee, the service is just really slow which was a big downfall for me, but the exterior was very nice and i plan on going back!"}
{"text":"Nice and modern cafe with a relaxing ambiance. The Americano came out with a nice layer of crema on top. The coffee was strong and I could taste the subtle nuances of the coffee beans. When I am back in Scarborough, I will be back."}
{"text":"Why did it take me forever to come to this place? After visiting one time for a drink + work space, came back 3x consecutively.    The staff were warm and friendly, music? I got transported back in time to the 90s and early 2000s.  Some may argue that was when music was still good.  It was hard to work honestly, as I would started sing-along sessions.  Check in for a free cookie. All the coffee I've tried so far has been fantastic.    I would tell you not to come, so I can keep a table for myself and all the drinks in the world.  But then, I would not be that friendly yelper.  It is so nice to find such an intimate coffee shop in the East End. No longer have to travel to downtown!"}
{"text":"Finally a decent coffee bar in Scarborough.   Super chic decor (very Instagram worthy), sleek bar, gorgeous tables - What's not to love about this place?  Their coffee is delicious, a great medley of strong, bitter and a touch of acidity. They're quite innovative with their drink as well, such as, liquid gold. A little too sweet for my taste buds but good nonetheless.  Unfortunately, the location isn't the best because the Asian plaza gets quite busy."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks Food was pretty good Owners are friendly!  Would recommend this place. Hidden gem in the area fosure and much needed lol"}
{"text":"I came here because a foodie friend of mine saw all of the Instagram posts about their new colourful teas and really wanted to try it. It turned out those drinks weren't on sale anymore but that was ok because we checked out their menu beforehand and had a few drinks we wanted to try. She got the raspberry white hot chocolate and I got this blue latte (forgot the name). I found both drinks were extremely sweet. There's a lot of hype but it's pretty average."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this cafe! It's hard to find good eats (let alone coffee shops) in Scarborough. And BlackGold is definitely a gem. Their coffees are great and they have quite a selection of teas (including a detox tea called Control Alt Delete for those who had one too many plates during Christmas dinner ;)).  I tried their Cajun chicken salad and their lobster bisque. Both were really good, especially the lobster bisque. Although a bit stingy on the lobster part, the soup was really delicious. Their macaroons are also really good   Quick tips: Don't forget to check in, they'll give you one free cookie. Also try and get there earlier, they have limited seats which is unfortunately given how much space they have in their cafe. Could use more tables and chairs!"}
{"text":"I don't know if anyone else has noticed but the sandwiches are smaller now (smaller bread). Still good though."}
{"text":"This is not just for Waterloo students and it's not just for Longtime Yelp Elites. It's a coffee shop for anyone looking to chill and escape the loudness of nearby dim sum and Chinese supermarkets. They push their tea more than most cafes so there's lots to try."}
{"text":"{Blueberry Caramel Fog}    Finally got the chance to visit this cafe!!  Came here with my best friends to do a bit of work. It's a relatively good size cafe with lots of tables and plugs for your laptop. Perfect for future study dates!   I decided to try it their blueberry caramel fog.  This is a lightly sweetened milk tea, I like it less sweet so this was perfect for me. But I absolutely loved the blueberry aroma!! I couldn't stop smelling it as I was drinking it  Definitely returning to try out their other coffee drinks!!"}
{"text":"Have only had a couple drinks here. If you like chai, you've got to try the chai latte, it's really good. I also got a Blue London fog, it is a little too sweet and that's coming from someone who absolutely loves sweets, so I would suggest asking them to not make it so sweet. Otherwise, friendly staff and quick. Only downfall is lack of seating, there's not much so wouldn't suggest coming here if you want to work on something cause you're not likely to find a good seat."}
{"text":"Location/Service Right in the intersection of a Brimley and Sheppard, in front of the local Asian supermarket. It's in a corner store of the plaza with indoor/outdoor entrance. Parking readily available.   Nice cozy decor, a local cafe style with free wifi and plenty of desk space. Staff were very friendly, very welcoming and enjoys having small conversations with you (if you're in the mood) and make good recommendations.   Food/Drink The cafe mostly serves pastries with a mini selection of sandwiches. I tried their red velvet cupcake - which was very soft on the inside, heavy on the red velvet taste and a light creamy top.   As for drinks, I believe they have local brewed coffee and specialty drinks. I tried their Iced London Fog - which initially served has distinct separation of the milk and tea. They provide the whole tea bag so you can always adjust to soak the tea a little longer if you like. The drink was not loaded with ice, love how it doesn't get super diluted and the drink itself was refreshing and not overly sweet.   My first visit seems to be a very positive one so far. Would like to try more of their speciality drinks and other pastries. This cafe is perfect if you need to do some studying/work or have a quiet small chat with friends or spend some date time with your loved ones."}
{"text":"Saw a sign that they had a promotion for free coffee (usually $1.5 for a small) so I decided to check it out. Interior was nice and modern and it was also very very clean. Got the apple pastry ($1) and the pastry was very flakey. Didn't have as much apple filling but it was still very delicious. It's a small place but it wasn't very busy at the time that I went.  Would definitely go back to try other items on their menu as they have pastries, salads, and some savoury foods also."}
{"text":"Very beautiful cafe with great food and great drinks! Brightly lit and spacious cafe that's actually quite quiet. Drinks are reasonably priced and they warm up the baked goods before they give it to you--nothing better than a warm double chocolate cookie! The baristas are friendly too! Great spot to relax and chat, I only wish they had more tables."}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks. This is a great place to catch up with friends. I've been here several times and always get their smoked salmon sandwich. For the bread you get to choose marble rye or white bread, I prefer the marble rye. They do not skimp out on the smoked salmon, the salmon is covered from end to end so that every bite you get salmon. I also like that they put a thin layer of cream cheese and a tiny bit of raw onion so that you don't get onion breathe after. The sandwhich is toasted on a panini grill so that it's hot and crispy.  I also tried their chai tea latte with almond milk. The drink was delicious, just the right amount of spices with a bit of froth and cinnamon and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"This cafe was just OK.  My latte was served room temperature. I didn't try any of the pastries, so I cannot comment on that, although they looked good and it seemed like they had great selection.  Comfort wise the chairs aren't too comfortable, but if you're going to be sitting for a bit that's fine. They do have free wi-fi, which is great for students.  A good thing about this place is that I don't think they're crazy busy all the time so if you're in the area, it's a great place if you just want to study or do some work and get out of the house. Would I come back? maybe; but it's definitely not a to die for place (or should I say.. Instagram picture worthy)."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place was pretty full! Nice place to meet a friend.  I got the Iced Blu-Caramel Fog, but half sweetened. I think half is already sweet enough and you can definitely taste the tea flavour throughout the drink. They steep it for a couple minutes before making the whole drink.  Got a free cookie because I checked in. Sea salt caramel chocolate chip. It was a little too chewy and crunchy for my usual liking but it was still really delicious. Also it was free so no complaints really.  Both of the staff were really nice and friendly. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's so big and clean all the time. It gives off good vibes. Best place to grab coffee or just to get some studying done. They have a bunch of tables and power outlets.   The parking outside had a sign that said max 2 hours, but I stayed for 3 and didn't get towed so it might not be too strict.   I love their drinks. They're asthetically pleasing. They come in variety of flavours and colours. Their cold drinks are the best, made with fresh ingredients that they put into the cup.   Their sandwiches was the biggest surprise. I got the Black gold special. The bread was so crunchy and the filling was so good. I have no idea what cream they used but it was perfect. It definitely hit the spot.   The cafe is still giving off a new place kinda vibe. The owner asked how I heard of the place and asked if I was gonna tell my friends (definitely will btw). Can't wait to see where it goes. I hope they add more vegetarian and vegan options to the food menu. I didn't spot anything that stood out other than that desserts."}
{"text":"I had to try the blueberry caramel fog that everyone was raving about! It was good, and half the sweetness level is enough. They use \"pluck\" tea here. Some other items I've tried included the latte (can't remember what I thought of it), matcha latte, tea (with vibrant colours), and a few of their sandwiches. A great spot to catch up with an old friend or grab a quick bite or study the day away. There's really no other good independent coffee shops uptown, this one is pretty much a hidden gem. I have always found service to be friendly and pleasant! Will definitely go back and also recommend it to anyone who wants a change from the usual Timmy's and Sbux. :)"}
{"text":"I am sure you guys have seen a lot of good reviews on Black Gold Cafe's coffee. Their sandwichs are surprisingly good too. The staffs are friendly and helpful, atmosphere are great, sandwiches are delicious and drinks are super instagammable. After all, It is really nice to have good cafe/coffee spot in the Scarborough area.   Food:  * Roast Beef Sandwich - Peppercorn aioli, red onion, thick slabs of seasoned roast beef, and leaf lettuce - $9.45 * BlackGold Club Sandwich - Mayo, havarti jalapeno cheese, red onion, roasted red pepper, cocktail turkey, spicy salami, tomato, and leaf lettuce - $9.45   Drink: * Raspberry White Hot Chocolate - $ 4.55 (M) * Blueberry Caramel London Fog - $4.15 (M)  Follow me on Instagram @eatwithJoT for more reviews and pictures :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon. Simple clean cafe spot to work/study or to catchup with a friend. Ordered their blackgold sandwich and was presently surprised at how good it was - freshly made to order and i asked without onions. Overall nice spot to check out."}
{"text":"Good service but imo a bit slow depending on which workers are there. This is my 5th time coming here. But I'll be reviewing the veggie salad specifically.   The first time I ordered it, the taste was amazing. Soft, sweet potatoes and the avocado dressing balanced the bitterness of the salad greens. LOVED it. I felt like the epitome of health.  I ordered it again today and sadly the batch of roasted veggies were all half-burnt and /really/ salty and oily. Tasted like literal  clumps of salt. I ate the greens and tossed the rest. No dressing was given either.  Will return but will stay away from the salad for a while."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant cafe but not the place to go if you are looking for downtown quality coffee/latte. The beans have the flavour of segafredo and Toronto is way past that now."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this cafe.  Perfect place to relax or to meet up with a friend to chat. Good luck finding parking though as the surrounding plaza and supermarket can get crazy busy.  I'm normally a coffee addict, but this time I opted to try an iced blueberry London Fog. I was pleasantly surprised! I could taste the notes of blueberry and vanilla. A definite change from the strong coffee I consume throughout the day.  I wish there were more of these independent cafes in Scarborough as it excludes more charm and character than your Tim's/ Starbucks."}
{"text":"One of the best cafes in Scarborough. The friendly custmor service and finely crafted drinks are bound to add happiness to your day."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this cafe with my visit.   Super friendly barista. She recommended me the tea elixir with a flavour mix of passionfruit and raspberry (iced drink). This was sweet and refreshing on a hot summer day.   I came in the afternoon on a weekday and there was lots of empty tables. I tried to find some plug outlets but it seems like there was only one (beside the tall chairs near the window).  I had an excellent experience here, free wifi and quiet which makes it a great working space.  P.S. they send pretty good promos through their newsletters!"}
{"text":"The place is just a little dirty bc the hot American cup for here was pretty dirty with bits of grounded coffee around the rim of the cup. As for the taste of their coffee, not that great. Ordered a hot and iced American...tasted burnt (taste just like Starbucks coffee) Also ordered Pegasus. It's not bad better than the Americano. Base on my experience, probably best to go for tea-based drinks or espresso drinks with syrup in it."}
{"text":"The coffee is just as good as you would get I  trendy downtown indy shops. The cuisine service was great, friendly staff and all the food items are halal."}
{"text":"I've had worse coffee before, but this place doesn't compare to that place. I thought the coffee was okay.. It just seemed too.. plain/bland for coffee. I ordered Americano Gusto. It wasn't strong that it seem like I was drinking water."}
{"text":"Had the Cajun chicken sandwich, the macadamia nut cookie and the clt-alt-del tea (basically a detox with ginger and lemon) and really enjoyed it all. The staff are super friendly, and the ambiance is very similar to Starbucks minus the crowd.   I also tried the lobster bisque soup which was super creamy but delicious.  They also have wifi for those of you who are looking for a place to study or work."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by here for a hot drink after work. The interior design of the café is really lovely, and stylish. It also has a chill and quiet atmosphere that I'd love to study in another time!   I got the medium blueberry caramel fog to go. The wait time was kind of long but I wasnt in any rush and I'm sure the baristas were still getting a hold of the ropes considering it opened quite recently.   I can see that they make everything to order and they don't take any shortcuts with their drinks :) The drink tasted great; not too sweet and although a milk based drink, it wasnt too heavy. I enjoyed the unique flavour, in the future I'd like to taste more caramel flavour though.   I can't wait to stop by again and try some of the pastries! Unfortunately they were out of spinach cheese croissants but I will definitely come by at an earlier time to get my hands on one."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! I was looking for a coffee shop near by my place, and I stumbled upon this newly opened cafe. They serve lattes (very good), coffees, teas, pastries, sandwiches and more. The staff are friendly, the place is nice and clean, free wifi, and there are outlets available for charging your devices. Coming back to try the other beverages. Good place for studying."}
{"text":"Black and Gold Cafe is a well located spot that's easy to find and has a lot of parking available.   The set up and decor is all beautifully themed, classically inspired but with vintage elements such as the to die for grey/white wood table.   The menu has such a creative and tasty variety of drinks. There is definitely a drink for every palate. We ordered two ice lattes, a Salmon Sandwich and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich. They were both delicious and very filling.  The Cajun Chicken had a perfect balance and even though the chicken was breast it was not dry at all.   We look forward to visiting again and definitely trying new items from the menu."}
{"text":"My first visit here as I saw a few reviews about this place. At first I was wondering where is the cafe. But luckily I found it. The cafe is inside a plaza with a few health care and pharmaceutical stores. If people are driving, just look for a Guardian Pharmacy. Just walk into the plaza, the cafe faces Brimley Road.   The cafe itself is very clean. I like the decor, it has an earthy feel. Another note, the cafe has a big window that faces west. Given there's plenty of sunshine, it will have lots of natural lighting. I like that. At the time I came by, there were only a handful of guests. But I can't say for certain when will be a quiet or busy time. If one is looking for a quiet place to have great conversations, I would highly recommend this place.   I picked up a pastry for breakfast, it was the spinach and feta bistro croissant. Sorry no picture, it was too tasty to share with the camera. The croissant is fresh, and didn't need any reheating. The cafe also serve juices and other cold refreshing drinks on top of the coffee.   I also like the staff's attitude. They actually engage you to chat in a friendly and normal way. Good service attitude and training. I am looking forward to come back next time."}
{"text":"I've struck gold! Black gold in fact! Hah, I can't believe I'm the first reviewer to open with that line.  We were looking for a Quiznos and our GPS took us on a wild goose chase. I was hangry and was about to let loose on my poor hubby when Yelp came to the rescue. What caught my attention was the picture of the roasted veggie salad; yeah, hubby and I are trying to eat healthier.  Nice looking cafe in the U Health Centre building with a number of regular tables, bar tables and half booths spaced out so you have lots of elbow room. Limited but intriguing looking menu.  After an informative discussion with the staff, we decided on the Turkey Club, (roasted) veggie salad and added (grilled) chicken, iced Blueberry Caramel Fog and a chunky brownie with frosting; don't give me that look!  A little pricey but geez was our lunch satisfying! There was a generous amount of succulent, nicely spiced, grilled chicken on top of the salad; the grilled veggies were good but a bit salty. The sandwich was decent; I loved the marbled rye bread they used. The iced Blueberry Caramel Fog looked pretty and tasted divine. For dessert I only ate a corner of the decadent frosted brownie which was a scrumptious way to finish of our lunch.  Two hour free parking, free WiFi, cool ambiance, easygoing staff, and delicious food and drinks: yes, this place is gold!"}
{"text":"Great place to get some studying done! The services are really helpful and the food is excellent. It can be a bit pricey for the meals, but it is worth it and filling!"}
{"text":"Staffs are generous to offer me free pastry to go along with my Matcha Green Tea Latte!  Both are awesome... would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This cafe is by far the best one I have gone to so far.  Staff there are friendly and you feel that they valued their customs. Food is amazing, got to try their veggie salad with roasted pepper, sweet potato and brussel sprouts, unique and delicious. Not to mention their coffee is much better than Starbucks definitely my go to place."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! Glad to see that they offer real food like sandwiches and pastries to go along with your coffee or tea. Great place to study at also! Would definitely come back, especially for their cake!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here and the staff were just as friendly as the first time I came.  Tried the pegasus drink and a small apple pie pastry. Both decent; the drink looks so pretty and it tastes like a lemonade. Just wished they had more unique bakery items!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best cafe that I've been to! Arriving at around 11 am, there were very less people so there was a ton of space. The barista kindly recommended the Blueberry Caramel Fog and the Raspberry White Hot Chocolate as one of the most favourites, so that's what we ended up ordering, as well as a delicious almond  (croissant)!   I ordered the small Blueberry Caramel Fog and it was super heartwarming after experiencing the cold weather of Canada outside. It tastes like caramel with hints of blueberry flavour. Subtle sweetness!  My friend got the Raspberry White Hot Chocolate, and compared to the caramel fog, it was waaayy much sweeter. It tastes like how the name says, Raspberry flavoured white hot chocolate! This drink is VERY aesthetically pleasing too.  the buttery almond croissant was filled with a almond tasting custard I think, but anyways it was amaazing."}
{"text":"After seeing this cafe on my feeds multiple time, we headed over to the black gold cafe for a quick pit stop. It is located right at the intersection of Brimley and Sheppard, where you can see the store front right on brimley so you can't miss it.   We went on a Sunday and the cafe was already full with many people studying, working, or having small meetings. I suggest coming alone or with only one friend if you are deciding dine in because otherwise good luck finding seats.   The menu showed a variety of drinks from the average lattes and mochas to some specialities such as raspberry white hot chocolate. They also have sandwiches and salads if you want something to eat as well. The pricing we thought we quite fair for the quality and amount you are getting compared to other cafes or chained coffee joints.   We ordered a raspberry white hot chocolate, a macchiato, and a raspberry danish. The hot chocolate was not too sweet and you can definitely taste the raspberry inside. The danish was very good as well with the cheese balancing the sour/tart flavour from the raspberry.  This cafe definitely deserves a 5/5 and we will come back to try more of their creations."}
{"text":"Ah, BlackGold never fails to satisfy me. Woke up thinking about their Blueberry Caramel Fog and Cajun Chicken Sandwich so I trekked across town with my bf. I typically ask for the blueberry Caramel Fog half sweet and it's the perfect level of sweetness for me. As for their Cajun Chicken Sandwich, it has a bit of a kick but the flavors and melty cheese blend very well together.  My bf got their BlackGold Club Sandwich and a London Fog. He said they're delicious. Not a man of many words.  After the sandwiches, I have a tendency to order a brownie as dessert, and they even help you warm it up. One of the best fudgy brownies I've ever had.  BlackGold also have one of the friendliest staff around and the ambience of an easy going cafe, quiet enough to work at or just chill with a date. 10 out of 10 would come again."}
{"text":"I didn't expect such a cafe in a predominantly asian neighborhood but it's really nice to have such a place in Scarborough. You can never have too many cafes, especially good independent ones.  The place is very modern, clean, and upon entry there were people doing work on their laptops, groups catching up, families, and older folks enjoying their beverages. It wasn't too loud here with light chatter and light music.   We ordered the veggie salad with grilled chicken, the blackgold club sandwich, and the blueberry caramel fog. The price was higher than I expected but everything was pretty good. The veggie salad was loaded with various greens and grilled veggies like artichokes, bell peppers, yams, and beats. There's a lot salad here and the dressing they give you is a ranch dressing. The chicken was quite tasty too and sufficiently spiced. The sandwich was pressed and warm. It was quite cheesy in a good way. I really liked the blueberry caramel fog which is one of the signature drinks. The blueberry was subtle and the caramel wasn't too sweet. It was very creamy from the steamed milk and very light.  Don't forget to check-in for a free cookie or biscotti, and connect to their free wi-fi for 20% discount for your next visit!"}
{"text":"I saw Jennifer's review pop up on my notifications and decided to make a trip here before I dragged myself back to work.   They have a small selection of baked goods. I opted for the chocolate croissant because there wasn't an almond croissant available. The light saltiness of the croissant goes nicely with the sweetness of the chocolate. I was told that their leek and parmesan croissant is really good, but I wasn't in the mood for something savory.  The owner of the café Ali was accommodating with my pickiness about the sweetness level in my drinks. While it doesn't say you can adjust sweetness levels on the menu, I told him I only want my blueberry caramel fog to be lightly sweetened. He said he'd make the drink for me based on what lightly sweet meant to him. He was spot on.   The caramel flavor wasn't cloying and I enjoyed that my tea latte is dominated by the strong flavor of blueberry. The blueberry scent and flavor reminds me of summer. The blueberry caramel fog basically tastes like the hot version of the Royal number 9 milk tea from The Alley in Richmond Hill. This is fantastic news for me because I won't need to make a 20 minute drive if I'm craving milky blueberry goodness from now on!  He gave me a bunch of coupons for free coffee to hand out to my coworkers which was such a generous gesture! I'm sure there will be a lot of willing testers from work and I know I'll be dropping by again soon to try their espresso based drinks."}

{"text":"TBH it was a 2.5 for me. We went as a group (8 people) and all found seats (although separate, we were seated close enough). We ordered:   - 2 different smoothies: average smoothies (only mango pictured)   - sparkling raspberry lemonade: p good but a little too sweet (red)  - iced matcha latte: ..... just... not matcha flavoured enough and tasted like watery milk in the end (green)  - 2 chocolate glaciers: the best out of all of our orders i think. kind of like starbucks but better (only 1 pictured)  - blue gold: looks good, doesn't taste good. it tasted like those QQ coconut jellys (yknow those from the bubble tea stores) but not flavourful enough. like watered down coconut milk. If it didn't look good, i would give it a 1 tbh. (light blue)  - pegasus: really sour. looks good but doesn't taste that good. (purple)   Overall, slightly overpriced for the products. Better off in Starbucks or Chatime. However, might be back to get the chocolate glacier or iced coffee, or try some hot drinks. Maybe a pastry or sandwich.   TLDR: basically, dont order the fancy stuff or the stuff that looks good on the gram (it will not taste good). just stick with the coffee."}
{"text":"The fact that this exists in Scarborough automatically qualifies for good rating. Scarborough is in a dire need of more independent Coffee shops and i hope this sets a good precedent.  Having had no \"Morning Coffee\" for a month because of Ramadan, I was craving an americano by indie cafe since it's usually different from the franchise.  I had a grilled chicken Sandwich and an Americano here. Both of them were good tasting. The Americano was a little weak, but the coffee beans they used had good flavour.  For anybody getting an Americano from here, ask them to put less water so you can have your Americano T H I C C."}
{"text":"Super cute cafe spot in Scarborough. The cafe is located in a little plaza near the asian supermarket. An odd location for sure, but definitely worth coming to try. There aren't too many tables but it doesn't seem to get super busy here (as in like, people waiting in line for a seat). Lots of people order out but my friends and I decided to just chill around. The decor is on point and I'd love to come here, bring my laptop, and do some work here all day.   They offer complimentary flavoured water (the day I went had a mix of lemon, mint, cucumbers and strawberries) and I believe they change the flavor every so often. Staff is very kind, offered suggestions on what to try, and overall just a cheerful bunch. I highly recommend getting the blueberry caramel london fog - a unique flavor and hits the sweet spot! I love the club sandwich too. The portion size is HUGE which was unexpected. If you're feeling a little bit fancy, I recommend getting their salmon bagel too.  Would come again if in the area!"}
{"text":"You won't be dissapointed here. Tasty coffee, cold brew, assorted baked goods, pleasant decor and basically a coffee oasis in an area without any speciality coffee shops. reasonable prices, large and spacious layout. Some couches would make it more cozy especially in the winter."}
{"text":"Who says the deeps of Scarborough or elsewhere like it cannot have the kind of indie coffee shop experience--decor, drinks and all--that is ubiquitous to death downtown?   It might be packed with university kids studying and socializing most days, and housed in a mostly empty commercial building, but BlackGold is quite well decent as a much-needed hangout spot in the area, or just for a quick bite and coffee. They make some great signature drinks, including colourful cold tea beverages like the 'Pegasus' (they serve the Pluck line of teas). I was delighted with some of their baked goods, but they also stock sandwiches and salads to go. Plenty of parking in and around the site.  {TTC: use the 84 or 21 bus to Sheppard at Brimley}"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe and conveniently located right in Scarborough! I recommend the matcha latte and the cajun chicken sandwich. Don't let the pictures on the yelp page fool you, the chicken sandwich is actually huge and can feed 2 people.   PSA: If the cupcakes are on sale (2 for 1) they're probably a few days old. Unfortunately I fell into the trap and bought 2 cupcakes only to find that they were kinda hard and had probably been sitting around for a while ://   But aside from the cupcakes, the sandwich and latte were delicious! :)"}
{"text":"It's my second visit and definitely am coming back more times with my friends.   They have great coffee taste and you have to try latte Mochaccino for sure. It's sweet but not over sweet.   The pastry is very fresh specially the chocolate avalanche and I was really delighted!"}
{"text":"I think I'm in love with this place. I tried a spinach feta danish and their promotional free coffee in regular roast today. The coffee was surprisingly very good on its own! I added a touch of cream, but was still able to get a good taste of the coffee beans. This was very shocking to me! I'm so used to drinking coffee drenched in cream and sugar, where you can't even taste the coffee itself. Also,  the cashier asked me if I wanted my danish warmed up, which I kindly nodded yes. I saw the girl tossing the danish in and out of the oven, but it was still cold. Lol!!! I'm pretty sure they forgot to turn their oven on. My spinach feta danish still tasted good, but would've been a lot tastier warm and flaky."}
{"text":"Decided to finally give this cafe a try. Dropped by on a weekday afternoon. Note that there are two entrances into the cafe (facing Brimley & through the plaza). Upon entering we were greeted by the staff right away. After hearing a few recommendations I decided to go with a hot blueberry london fog. The presentation was nothing fancy (no latte art). The barista offered to serve us two cookies instead of one (if you check in via Yelp you get a complimentary cookie). The drink itself was definitely unique although on the sweeter side. The cafe is quite petite but with plenty of seats (tables and bar top chairs by the window). Possibly a good study place for students. It did however get a bit busier when 4pm rolled around."}
{"text":"Saw the lawn sign and I had go in to check it out.  Staff was friendly. The dark roast brew was perfect.  Price is great too.  Hands down better....A much better option from the regular chains around town.  Very cozy and comfortable atmosphere.  Parking during peak hours might be a challenge though.  If I am in the area and needed a pick me up dose of caffeine...I will most certainly be back to try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing study/work spot in Scarborough. I came in on a Saturday night and was not too busy.  Menu offering is large - aside from the usual tea and coffee (I ordered a jasmine tea which was great), they have cakes, danishes, and sandwiches. Wifi is fast, seating is adequate, and they're open till pretty late (9-10pm). I'd choose this place over Starbucks any day."}
{"text":"I would say compared to downtown there are not a lot of good coffee shops in scarbs. However BlackGold Cafe surprised me. Cute atmosphere, great food, and cool drinks.   All the tea's look amazing, food is all fresh and has that home touch that I love. I wish they would get a couch or some more comfortable seating, that way people could hang out and do some work.   Check them out!   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"I have only tried the drinks from this place and they were so good. Especially the raspberry white hot chocolate! Looks pretty and tastes delicious! The food looks good as well!! Wish they had more veggie options though. The place itself is really pretty and modern. They take a lot of time and put a lot of effort into their drinks. Barista was helpful and quick."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to work/study; a good alternative to Starbucks (but seating is not guaranteed, either). Very spacious and clean. Located at the corner of the 'Health Centre', there is an entrance from the street as well as inside the building.   I ordered a cappuccino (average) and cherry cheese danish (warmed up, good!)."}
{"text":"a great alternative to starbucks.  a typical millennial cafe joint.  young adults on their laptop and smart phones.  a good selection of food both breakfast and lunch and dinner?  friendly staff.  cozy interior.  prices are decent.  a medium mochawhatever goes for $4 taxes in.    yeah, i am a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Been here twice - great Americano and tuna sandwich. Wish they had more food options.   The first time I came here, one of the staff members didn't know anything about their coffee menu and didn't know how to use their POS iPad system. The owner/manager(?) stepped in and was very helpful afterwards.   Nice setup and great wifi if you plan to stay awhile with your laptop. Would recommend this place.   Free parking in the back by the health Centre."}
{"text":"Was super excited after reading all these positive reviews about this cafe, but was met with much disappointment--especially when it came down to customer service; zilch!.   There were 4 people at the counter, 1 girl busy blending drinks (back turned), 1 girl busy making sandwiches (back turned), 1 guy in the backstore, and 1 girl completely dismissing my presence while she ate her instant noodles. After waiting awhile, it was the girl making the sandwiches whom had turned around and asked if I had ordered to which I had answered, no. THEN, all of a sudden as if I've materialized out of thin air did the girl eating noodles acknowledge my existence. If she was taking a break, just let me know (because that's totally fine) that someone other than herself will come and assist me. Leaving a customer standing there is like a like f-you to me.  Waited politely for another 10 minutes for my latte to go; wasn't even reassured with a \"please hang on a bit longer, we'll be getting to your drink soon.\" The store was not even busy.   Noticed the instant noodles girl making the latte was a novice. She let the milk steamer sizzle making a screaming noise for an extended period of time. For one, that's a big no no in the barista manual--because it means not enough air is drawn into the milk which ultimately scalds the milk and makes it sour.   The latte seemed to use Rufino beans and tasted alright if you can overlook the sour steamed milk. For $3.67 (after tax) medium latte it was ok, but will never come back here. Am pretty confident there are other cafes out there who will treat me like a valued customer. Where was the \"amazing customer service\" everyone was taking about?"}
{"text":"Great service, came here on a Wednesday afternoon and there was still some seating left. The almond croissant was delicious and the coffee super rich + creamy. Try their Italian  sodas if you can because they're bubbly and flavourful. I'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least 5 or 6 times since my last review and here are some things I've noticed.  Every time I've come here, it's really loud. The cafe is usually mostly full and it's a small space - that could be part of the reason? It depends on the kind of culture and atmosphere you want to create, I suppose. It's mostly university or high school students chatting and laughing when I go. The clientele leans young though occasionally I see people older than me. Personally, I go to cafes for a relaxing experience and a quiet place to do work - I probably should have known that it would become more popular as I first started going when this place was new. The music is also everywhere which doesn't really set a vibe - I hear things from top 40 to 2010's pop and rock and oldies to... I'm not sure I know because it really is all over the place. And the music is loud, maybe because the people are loud. The volume is a major reason I don't come here anymore. Maybe it's quieter during weekdays? Which is fine - I don't think BlackGold set out to become a hipster minimalistic indie cafe playing indie folk music with a quiet atmosphere anyway. It just doesn't suit my needs.  Don't expect latte art unless the owner is there. I find their lattes/specialty drinks lean sweet. I like sweet so I'm okay with that. However, the very instagrammable raspberry white hot chocolate is a sugar bomb (well it is hot chocolate...). The spinach and feta bistro is a good choice for a snack.  The baristas are really friendly, and how should I say this... they're very chill. They seem quite young (this is not a negative thing) and from what I can tell they seem to be in school, and so perhaps for them this job is not their main focus. They're always chatting (which is great - staff should have a good relationship with each other) but the impression I get is that they don't take their jobs seriously. I can't explain it - it's just the vibe I get. Small things like in my last review, where halfway through my latte they informed me that they had accidentally given me regular milk instead of lactose free. That could have been a very serious error for someone else, but thankfully for me it wasn't. It was quite a while ago, but it made enough of an impression on me to remember it. I've noted other examples before during my visits here, but I can't remember them now. But the baristas are very, very friendly and nice and it's honestly great that they don't look like the super stressed out people who work at Starbucks. I try to be as balanced as possible when I review, and I'm usually not so subjective about a place, and especially the people that work there, but I have enough feelings about it to comment on it.   When you log on to their wifi with your email, the owner sends you discounts and free items from time to time. It's a nice way to keep people coming back and build a loyal fanbase (which they obviously do have) which is an amazing thing for a local, independent cafe. They also do local events here which brings the community together.  I know this review reads like I hate places where young people hang out and have fun, but I've barely hit my mid-twenties. I guess it's just not exactly what I'm looking for in a cafe. For me, I go to cafes for a place to get down to business and be productive and in general, I enjoy quieter spaces. Different strokes for different folks - like many people here, you might love it."}
{"text":"I love that there's a place like this in Scarborough! It's a nice, relatively quiet place to hang out and the drinks are magical. The tea elixir that I had was very refreshing, and I can't wait to try out their other offerings. Checking in gets you a free biscotti! :)"}
{"text":"This is hands down , the best coffee shop in Scarborough.  For those of you looking for real Italian style coffee , this is the place.    So far , I've enjoyed their double shot Americano and single shot espresso.  I must say , excellent coffee.  It's nice to see indie cafes starting up in the GTA."}
{"text":"Friendly service, casual vibe in a quaint cafe. A lot of baristas don't bother with the small details that make an Americano taste better (warming up the cup, having the espresso drop into a cup with hot water already in it) so I was pleasantly surprised when they hit all the check marks. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything is great about this cafe. One thing that really stood out for me was how smooth the coffee was. I'm not much of a coffee drinker but this place makes me want to come back for more."}
{"text":"This cafe is one of it's kind.. love the tea that changes it's colour and their spinach pastry is the best of all. Very vibrant and neat looking shop"}
{"text":"Cute coffee place for something in Scarborough!! From their variety of hot & cold drinks, along with pastries and sandwiches, you can definitely get your coffee fix here. The place itself is spacious, with free wifi & plenty of seating. The workers are also extremely nice!   We ordered the iced blueberry caramel fog drink ($4.85 regular) & a banana loaf ($2.55). The banana loaf was delicious, especially warmed up. The loaf itself was moist, soft & flavourful. Like any good banana bread it had a rich banana flavour. However, this one was covered in oats & just made it that much better. Through the quality of this loaf, I would definitely try the other pastries and food they have to offer.   The iced blueberry caramel fog did, however, disappoint.  The pricing is reasonable in comparison to other coffee shops, but this flavour combination was not good. At first you get a lot of milk flavour, followed by a little caramel & then a strong hit of cherry medicine flavour. It was odd. The ice also started to melt into the drink bc the tea was warm when added in, making the drink more watery & distasteful."}
{"text":"My fiancé has been wanting to go here for some time and we were finally in the area so we dropped by to try their drinks. We tried the 2 drinks that we've seen posted a lot on social media which are Pegasus and Blue Gold. Both drinks are tea-based, they use local Toronto premium tea - Pluck. I think that for these particular drinks, they use the Verbena Blue - which has a lemon ginger flavour.   Blue Gold has coconut milk, flower petals, lavender and elderflower syrup while Pegasus has some flowers as well mixed with lemon and lime. Both drinks tasted great and are very visually appealing, I found that I enjoyed the Blue Gold drink more.   Also, don't forget to check-in as there is an offer for a free cookie or biscotti, had a double chocolate warmed up while my fiancé had an almond croissant, both went well with our drinks. They also had some La Rocca cake slices that I am a sucker for that I will try on our next visit."}
{"text":"It is the first time I've had coffee at this place. I tried their regular coffee and loved it instantly. The medium blend was perfect and I was able to drink the coffee black, which I couldn't do for low grade coffee. It's a great place to catch up with friends or go on a date as the location is quiet and the environment well decorated. Their cheese cake is also great! I tried their blueberry cheese cake and the sweetness was just right, not too sweet and the texture is great. I'll definitely return for future gatherings with friends."}
{"text":"First time here at BlackGold Cafe. Got two matcha green latte, red velvet cup cake and chocolate avalanche.   Start off with the latte, pretty disappointed with how they filled up my latte and the difference in taste between the two cup that I got. The one I got was pretty diluted.   Chocolate avalanche prob my favour. It was so good! I'm not a big fan of chocolate but this is by far the best chocolate pastry I've had.   The red velvet is cup cake is good.   Def go back for the chocolate avalanche. But not sure about the drinks.    ----  Went back for a second time. I was served by Meliza (she was very polite and knows her stuff)  Had the London Fog which was pretty decent! One word \"addicted\"!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into Black Gold Cafe today. First impression was that it's clean, welcoming and bigger than it looks from the outside. The staff were super nice and informative. (I always have to ask a bunch of questions due to allergies.) P.S. If anyone is also lactose intolerant out there, they have lactose free milk. Ordered: iced bluegold latte, iced caramel latte, veggie salad with grilled chicken, pizza pastry (forgot the name and we ate it before I took a picture of it :|) and caramel cookies. The veggie salad was feta cheese with roasted Brussels sprouts, onions and yams atop a bed of spring mix. I added chicken to the salad and the staff forgot to mention that the grilled chicken is also spicy. To be fair I'm a wimp at spicy stuff so it's prob not considered spicy to most. More importantly, it was tasty. The pizza pastry was filled with pizza sauce and three different types of cheeses. Plenty of space to sit and they also have free wifi. If you connect to the wifi, you can receive 20% off your next visit. Also, if you check in, you can get a free cookie. It's a nice cafe with good ambience. I'll definitely be making my way back to it sometime soon."}
{"text":"It's a relatively decent spot to have a catch up date or study which is a diffrent spot from the generic Starbucks or Second Cup. However, I was turned off with the expensive prices of the sandwiches and also came to realize that many of the pastries are jacked up prices of pastries I can find at Michel's Bagguette. The Cajun Chicken sandwich was yummy though but not anything special and that I can't make in my own at home. The drinks however were lovely and something I'd come back for. Loved the iced blu-london fog latte and raspberry mint sparkling lemonade."}
{"text":"5/5  A recently opened cafe with nice decor, spacious environment and friendly people. Coffee was very good and better than the average. Not only do they have coffee, but they also carry pastries one should try. Tried their apple danishes and they were quite good: soft, tasty and not too overwhelming; their cheese and leek was excellent as well.  If you're in Scarborough and not wanting the typical Tim's or McD's coffee, check this place out."}
{"text":"This place opened up not to far from where I live and have been meaning to try this place out. When I finally did, it was so surprise why it has done fairly well. I came here on some last minute plans to grab something to eat and something to drink while I waited for another friend to come meet up.  Originally I was looking at getting something to drink and wait around, but I ended up getting something to eat as well. I ordered a Cajun Chicken Sandwich and a Iced London Fog. Both were great! I REALLY enjoyed the London Fog, and the sandwich was great.  On the day I went, the POS system went down and couldn't do any card transaction for a little bit. I had cash luckily and wasn't mad at it, but the employees apologized and gave us two cookies as a kind gesture; much thanks!  If you're ever in the area, do give this place a try. It's a great place to study, catch up with friends, or just want a great drink."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite cafe. Great place to have deep conversations with your friends, study and even relax. Service is amazing there, people there are super duper friendly and nice. Would definitely recommend you guys to come."}
{"text":"A decent cafe that allows you to relax in the afternoon.   Cajun chicken sandwich is a hit i believe. It tastes good! Crispy and hot bread on the outside with soft and juicy chicken inside, especially love them putting grilled bell pepper in there adding some smokey flavour.  I always wanted to try out their quinoa salad but never got to luck. So i tried their grilled veggie salad and i am satisfied with the tasteful fresh veggie.  And give their brownie a try too if you are ordering coffee, best combination ever!"}
{"text":"Pricey place in a rundown neighborhood. Clean. Friendly service. Nice decor. Service a bit slow. Great sandwiches, fresh and hearty soup and salads, nice drinks. A small cake selection from LaRocca."}
{"text":"Lovely employees as usual :)  I had their new Blue Gold drink and my friend ordered Pegasus. We shared a Cajun chicken sandwich and a Caesar salad with chicken.  Blue Gold: I'm not a fan of the coconut taste, but I got used to it after a while. Otherwise it's okay, though I wouldn't get it again.  Pegasus: Way too sour for my taste, but my friend liked it.  Cajun chicken sandwich: Pretty good. I'm not a total fan of onions, but it worked.  Caesar salad with chicken: Loved it! The girl at the cash register was right: chicken makes the salad taste so much better.  BlackGold is one of my go-to places to get food and relax."}
{"text":"I can't believe I got such a terrible morning. I thought i might be the first client this morning, but I have waited for half hour? Others all got their food earlier than me. Then, I asked her package everything to go. When I got office and started my breakfast I found she forgot my bakeries, only packaged my sandwich."}
{"text":"I have had BlackGold Cafe bookmarked since it opened, but I was never really in the area convenient enough to stop by.  It was a really hot afternoon at around 1:30pm, and I dropped by for a cup of iced coffee after some grocery shopping down the street. I wanted dairy substitutes and some almond milk was placed on the bar for me to pour it myself. Yay for dairy substitutes and I much prefer to \"make my own coffee\". Many cafes either add too little, or too much almond milk. But I noticed that the almond milk they put out was sweetened and I have never been to a cafe that offers sweetened almond milk instead of unsweetened. On the other hand, the coffee was decent.  There were a lot of students / young adults in the cafe studying and chatting way, giving off a very positive vibe; however, the employees here beside the guy who took my order seem to be very unprofessional. I have been to many cafes in downtown Toronto and around the GTA, and the staff here clearly did not seem like they suit to work for a cafe. It seemed more like they were here to attend a high school re-union, or some sort of casual party to have fun."}
{"text":"This is my FAVOURITE independent cafe in Scarborough!! I have gone to this place for about 4-5 times since it opened 6 weeks ago. And since their opening, they've had 2 promotions and both were wonderful!  It was kind of hard to find this place though, as it is inside a small plaza. But there is a billboard sign if you come from finch.  The interior is of course black and gold. I love that it is spacious and you can see everything when you walk in from either entrance. I love that they don't fill up every space in the cafe just to accommodate more seats. They have high chairs, several round tables and some booth chairs. Love that you can also sit around the \"bar\".   The service is excellent! Everyone is super friendly and will help you if you don't know what to order! I have had the lattes, regular brew coffee (both cold and hot) and they were wonderful! At one of my visits, they gave out 2 for 1 near the end of the day. The tomato egg pastry was alright. The banana chocolate muffin was good. I was told that they freshly bake all pastries every morning. They also serve cakes as well. There is also options for food, mostly sandwiches, if you are hungry.  Free high speed wifi, good background music, good place for studying/working, what more can one ask?   I definitely recommend this cafe to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mom, and we ordered a matcha green tea latte, tuna sandwich and their breakfast sandwich. The prices are a bit high from just looking at the menu but the food is delicious. The tuna sandwich I ordered was a lot bigger than I expected, and the green tea latte was presented nicely with a design in the foam.   Despite the prices bring a bit high, I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Came here today at around lunchtime.  It wasn't super busy but there was a steady stream of customers.  There were no line ups and everything was given to us promptly.   The cafe had a nice relaxed atmosphere which I enjoyed. My friends and I were able to chat and linger while enjoying our food and beverages.   I ordered the green tea - there are two varieties. I think I had the jasmine flower one and a spinach and feta pastry, which was light and flaky.  I'm not a coffee drinker so I can't comment on the coffee.  My friends seemed to like their coffees. The tea didn't stand out for me personally."}
{"text":"I had my first ophthalmologist appointment a month ago at Uptown Eye Specialists. I was there for three hours. Naturally, there was lots of waiting and tests.  Although my eyes were dilated sitting in the waiting area, I still noticed other folks waiting with me with coffee cups. Where did they get their coffee?  After my appointment, I just wanted to go home. I vowed to figure out where this coffee place was.  Today, I went back for my second appointment. Less waiting. Same dilated eyes. Guess what? Black Gold Cafe is the place where folks were getting their coffee fixes. It is next door to the eye office. Yep, my vision was that blurry at my last appointment that I had no clue.  It was noon and I was hungry. I headed over to the cafe after my appointment. It's a cozy cafe. If I hadn't got an eye injection, I would have stayed there to eat. Instead, I wanted to go and get some lunch, and enjoy it at home.  I was greeted by two helpful, cheerful folks behind the counter. The iced matcha tea latte had matcha green tea and milk, according to the chalkboard menu. I asked whether I could get soy instead of milk. The gentleman said I could. He even had coconut milk. Yes, please!  Of course, I am a sucker for pastries. One look at the chocolate avalanche, which is a wonderfully flaky croissant with rich chocolate filling, I knew that it had to be mine. I ordered it. It was warmed up for me.  The iced coconut matcha? tea latte was perfect! I love the strong taste of matcha contrasted with the light sweetness of the coconut milk. I got the regular. Now that I know that it's yummy, I will go with the large next time.  The chocolate avalanche was amazing! I had planned to bring it home to eat. I live ten minutes away from this location by car. Instead, I ate it in my car. So tasty!  This cafe also offers sandwiches. I will give the grilled cheese sandwich a try next time.  This place offers free wifi. I didn't give it a try, but I saw the sign. Payment methods include cash, and credit and debit cards.  (113)"}
{"text":"It's really great to see so many cool cafes like BlackGold opening up in the suburbs.   This place is a bit out of the way for us to get to on a regular basis but we'll definitely be visiting Scarborough more often in the future if we are thinking of a nice coffee shop.  The atmosphere is very cozy and comfortable.   I really liked how the tables are nicely spaced apart so that it feels really roomy.  Although the selection of food is very limited, I was really impressed with the food that we ordered.  We had the veggie salad and the 2 sandwiches.  The salad was filled with mix greens topped with grilled red peppers, onions, sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts..absolutely delicious.  We got the smoked salmon and the BlackGold club sandwiches which were perfectly prepared.  To my surprise, I really liked the marble rye bread that was so good especially when it was toasted with melted cheese in the club sandwich.  The lattes were pretty good but it was the dark roast coffee that really stood out for me.  Overall,  we really liked this place and we will definitely be chilling here when we are in the area."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5  Located in the plaza next to Oriental Centre at Brimley Rd & Sheppard Ave E. Plenty of parking spots but a bit of a walk from the parking lot to the main entrance.   [SERVICE] - 4/5 Barista was helpful and friendly. I took a couple minutes to set up my laptop at the table, and my order was ready!   [DÉCOR] - 5/5 Modern and cozy. There are some cute plaques with funny quotes on them. I also love the black & gold theme. Those colours really complement each other.   [FOOD QUALITY] - 4/5 On par with most small and independent cafés, this place also uses high-quality ingredients in the drinks, and baked goods, and other food items.   [ORDER] - Feeling Sick? Drink This. - $3.85: a delicious & soothing concoction of lemon, cinnamon, green tea, lemon ginger tea, honey, topped with mint leaves. Literally warmed me up when I drank this on a cold day. I didn't really like the mint, but I could see how it can add a hint of freshness to the tea.   - Spinach & Feta Danish - $2.95: presentation was on-point! Pastry was flaky and delicious! Spinach & feta were ooey and gooey.   [OVERALL] - 4/5 Overall, a great spot for study sessions, catching up with friends, dates, or rest & relaxation. Food and drinks are delicious, and décor is very aesthetically pleasing."}
{"text":"Pretty nice cafe. Spacious interior, good food and coffee drinks.  I had the soup of the day, which was butternut squash, and the veggie salad with an iced chai and brownie. The soup was fairly cheap and filling, and was flavorful and creamy. The salad was in a large bowl, had a decent amount of toppings and was very healthy. I enjoyed these lunch items! The iced chai was sweet and cinnamony. I think the only things I didn't like were the amount of ice they put in my drink and the drink was sweetened, which is just a personal opinion. It reminded me of the chai latte from Starbucks, so if you're into that then it's perfect for you. We got our brownie heated so it was very soft, chewy and decadent, it was really good!  Good place to study if you are in the area, there are a few outlets and tables. Interesting and unique addition to the Scarborough neighbourhood."}
{"text":"What is this...??  A legit independent coffee spot with good food and super pleasant and friendly baristas?  In the middle of SCARBOROUGH?   Damn.  I honestly want this place to succeed so other potential barista and coffee spot owners can see how it can be done in the GTA.    I'm going to be upfront and say that this open and spacious little spot warmed up my heart because I'm so used to seeing corporate replicas for mediocre coffee in the suburbs.  BlackGold has a nice chill and super clean spot with tons of natural light coming through.  The tables are plentiful and spaced out nicely.  I think they do have wifi on offer but I'm going to be honest that I dont remember cause I was in shock the moment I walked in the door.  They have a fully stocked barista bar where they serve up everything from regular drip coffee to a more fancier specialty drink like Blueberry Caramel Fog Tea Latte (Im sure I got this name wrong) or maple latte.   I have to give full credit to the 2 wonderful and cheerful baristas.  Dear lord... can you work in more places?  There's something just amazing when you talk to someone (even briefly) who is actually genuinely interested, happy, and ready to make your order.   So service and atmosphere is full 5 stars ESPECIALLY for the suburbs.  I was ready to grab a few things for a take out lunch and my arrival at 11 am was no issue.  They quickly explained their food offering and I grabbed a grilled cheese and a vegetarian salad.  For the prices I paid, these were very good and would happily grab another salad if im in the area.  Dirty Chai Latte - An interesting take on the chai latte... it had a different spice than I'm used to but that doesnt take away the fact that this is better than most places.  It's not sugary sweet like other spots but rather have a good spice note.  This one is a bit on the watery side but still good. 4/5  Blueberry Caramel Fog Tea Latte - Oh this is a nice latte... they had a tea bag infused latte that gave off a nice well rounded blueberry scent and flavour in the latte.  This one was not watery or too sweet either.  It was a nice balance. 4.5/5  Vegetarian Salad - Trying to find a salad that isn't laden with heavy sauces or meats is hard... this was just perfect.  A good healthy lunch size salad with many different grilled vegetables including sweet tender sweet potatoes and peppers... perfect.  I thought this was great especially for the price. 4/5  Grilled Cheese - Another cafe staple done well... though nothing screamed wow about this but it was well made and a good portion.  Nice gooey cheese on a crisp bread.  For those who like a gooey one... this would be your sandwich. 4/5  Overall, I'm really happy to see a spot like this north of the 401.  It has great service and good drinks.  It's super rare and unheard of in GTA west... which makes me hopeful one day we'll see one like this over there. Yes"}
{"text":"As soon as I got into this cafe I could picture myself being there often. Friendly staff, clean and a very well done interior making it a comfortable environment. It's not a cafe I'd say you could study in because it was really packed as it's not that spacious. But it's definitely a cafe that you could take your friend to as you catch up over a yummy drink.   The fact that it's halal is one of the main reasons I'd go back. Not being able to have that deli sandwich from Starbucks or any other cafe that doesn't serve halal, this cafe has made decision making super easy.   The sandwiches itself are pretty good. I got the black gold club sandwich which has salami and turkey in it. The basil really hit the spot, I love basil. I do feel like something was missing.. a sauce. A nice chipotle or mustard or even a little spice would do it.   Mango smoothie was made with perfection! I also tried my friends sparkling raspberry lemonade and it was delicious, I'll be getting that next time I'm in. The London fog iced drink wasn't as good as the hot one.    Overall it's a nice cafe with a chill vibe. I wasn't tooooo crazy about the sandwiches because it's something I could have at home any time but if they had a secret sauce I'd probably want to get it  The drinks and halal option got me as a returning customer."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating I originally didn't have a good first impression of this place because when we ordered, they didn't have their featured special new quiona salad (claimed it's sold out but we got there 1hd after opening...). They also had a sign featuring a special drink which they claimed they dont make that drink anymore..then why still hang the sign?   Black Gold club sandwich ($8.95) The club sandwich was good, nicely pressed but nothing special.  Blueberry caramel fog ($4.15 for medium) The blueberry caramel fog was good, quite sweet tbh but really strong in blueberry flavor.  Veggie salad ($7.95) The veggie salad was surprisingly my favorite. It's mixed with fresh greens and cooked vegetables including brussell sprouts, sweet potatoes, onions and peppers. Don't know what salad dressing it was but it was tasty!  Soup of the day which was roasted peppers cheddar cheese ($4.95) The soup was tasty too, had a nice kick to it.    Overall a nice coffee shop. Nice decor, could use a few more tables though.  Oh and don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free cookie or biscotti!"}
{"text":"I was never a fan of cafés.  But I must admit that this place is pretty good.  They offer a list of stuffings for your bread.  I had the smoke salmon.    Surprisingly it tasted better than I thought. The bread is toasted just right. And the combination of sause, meat, tomato, onions are just right.  I would've ordered seconds if I didn't already ate prior to coming.  Their drinks are very delicious as well.  It has a very chocolate taste to it.    The presentation as a whole was very well done.  The workers are very polite as well.    I wonder why there wasn't much people there.  Perhaps it's the location?"}
{"text":"I saw the ice blue drinks and I wanted to come and check it out! Not exactly what I expected...  We had the following:  1. Blue Pegasus (not on their menu):  This was the ice blue drink that I kept seeing pop up on instagram. In brief, it's a blue tea with a lime and sugar water concoction at the bottom. I asked if they could do no sugar, so instead of the sugar water, they just used a lime-lemon substitute. It was definitely pretty, but I'm not sure if it's because I opted for no sugar, but it was TOO sour. My face puckered up immediately and I could only have a few sips. I couldn't really taste the tea itself because it was so tart - maybe I'll come back and try the original.  2. Raspberry White Hot Chocolate: Another instagram-famous photo, which prompted me to come. It was again, very pretty to look at, but instead of too sour, it was too sweet this time. The raspberry was a bit overwhelming so the chocolate taste was barely there - disappointment.  3. Smoked Salmon Sandwich: I liked that they had different bread choices, so I chose the rye. They also have different cream cheese options too. I was surprised by the amount of smoked salmon - I was expecting a little bit more for $8.99. It was average.  4. Grilled Cheese: My friend chose white bread and the sizes of both our sandwiches were the same - but it was the same thing - expected a bit more cheese in the middle. Again, it was average.  Overall, the staff was super nice and knowledgeable, but the tastebud experience was just about average. I would definitely have to come back and try their coffee and maybe their infamous quinoa salad. With that said, I would still say go check them out and have your own opinion about it because they are definitely photo-worthy!"}
{"text":"First time trying the Black Gold Cafe. I had their Blueberry and Caramel Fog (a variation to the London Fog) and it was amazing. It wasn't too sweet with a hint of blueberry."}
{"text":"Delicious veggie sandwich and log fog drink! I highly recommend both! Great place to get food and do some work. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came here around final exam season to study and this place was perfect!  Aside from the bad window view, the cute Christmas decorations and deep aesthetics almost makes up for the fact that it is connected to an asian supermarket, next to oriental centre  The drinks are fairly cheap from an average of 2- 5 dollars   I suggest the Chai Latte with cinnamon!"}
{"text":"Really nice cafe/ coffee shop in Scarborough. I usually go to downtown out of my way but this is a very good location for people who can't go to down town all the time. The drinks are as good as they get also food looks delicious and tastes amazing. Definitely a replacement to all cafes and coffee shops in downtown."}
{"text":"What a relaxing way to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon. This newly opened cafe in the Agincourt area has a charming decor with an inviting feeling. As a local, it's pretty cool that people were constantly walking in right off the street or just hanging out. The food was on point with a nice selection of made-to-order sandwiches, salads and freshly baked pastries. But for me I think the large choice of hot and cold drinks are the real attraction!  My favourite thing from here was their variant on the London Fog - the Blueberry Caramel Fog. It starts with a blueberry caramel rooibos tea with added vanilla & caramel, and topped with steamed milk. It's definitely a sweet drink, but it was just the right sweetness for my taste. The Grilled Veggie Salad is fairly unique (usually my salads are completely raw) and for the better. It's paired with an Avocado Caeser dressing which I've been told is all the rage these days. Finally there's the pastries. Ali, the owner/operator told us that they're made in France and baked fresh in-house daily."}
{"text":"Checked out Blackgold this weekend to grab a cold drink to feel a bit more refreshed with this gross heat we were experiencing. This review is purely based on my drink and snack and not real food.  I ordered a large iced match latte made with skim milk. The drink wasn't very satisfying. Not enough matcha flavour. And it wasn't cold enough. But that could be relative to the heat wave. Also I found this drink to be quite expensive. I should have gone to Starbucks and gotten myself some stars towards a free drink!  The only redeeming factor was that I got a free cookie because I checked in on yelp.  The cookie was also disappointing. Tasted like a store bought cookie from the grocery store. I would have given it one star, but the ladies behind the counter were very nice and answered any questions I had."}
{"text":"Black Gold Cafe, Welcome to the Neighbourhood! A neighbourhood that in desperate need for a decent indie cafe. We have enough of Tim Horton's and Coffee Time and McD. We want some real espresso coffee. We want a real cafe. We want a better experience!  Aside from coffee, rejoice tea lovers! Here you will find tea from Pluck Tea based in Toronto which specialized in small batch, locally grown ingredients and handcrafted blends.  There are also pastries and treats nicely presented and it is hard not to order one to go with your drinks! And they even have sandwich and salad?! Baked good are baked in house daily. Love their Danish!  Americano ($2.20) was well made with nice crema! I am eyeing their Liquid Gold Espresso and even their Affogato!  Grand Opening Special: Free small coffee and $2 Small Latte till end of March!"}
{"text":"Really nice to have a very chill and cool spacious cafe in the brimley and sheppard area thats bot starbucks or tims. Place has a very good selection of teas and coffees. They also make really good chai tea lattes. And the sandwich have all been delicious, even the grilled cheese is really good and really fresh. Nice to see the owner/manager being active on the front end helping clean out the tables and also serving people. Also, great place for instagrams if ya'll lookin for that great coffee/latte shot.  #eatfatkid on ig"}
{"text":"So happy this cafe opened! It was about time that Scarborough opened up a cafe that looks/feels like one in Downtown Toronto.  Upon arrival my friend and I were greeted by the staff. The staff seemed very kind and helpful. The service was pretty fast. I can definitely say that this cafe is clean, however not so spacious. There is limited seating, so you might want to come earlier to get a seat.  I got hot chocolate to drink, which was really good! I also tried two pastries, one was a sweet pastry that had chocolate in it and the other one was a savoury pastry (I forgot both names sorry!). We heated both of the pastries up a bit and both of them were so delicious!  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.  P.S. parking here can be a nightmare at times!"}
{"text":"After seeing all the IG photos I definitely had to try this place house and since it's in Scarborough too.  I had the roasted veggie salad and a matcha latte.  Both very delish.  I really enjoyed the salad.    Also the staff is super friendly and even apologize for the little delay since they had a wave of customers come in.  I can see why.  They also play 80s music which is a big bonus!!!!!!  Great place for something sweet and salty."}
{"text":"BlackGold Cafe is a lovely spot to have a drink, study or eat a snack.  It has a clean and visually appealing atmosphere and friendly baristas.    My boyfriend and I ordered the Cajun Chicken Sandwich and the Smoked Salmon sandwich.  Both of us enjoyed the Cajun Chicken one more, as it had stronger flavours.  The barista forgot to put smoked salmon in our Smoked Salmon Sandwich, but quickly fixed it up when we let her know.  For drinks, we ordered the Raspberry White Hot Chocolate and the Matcha Latte.  The Raspberry White Hot Chocolate tasted like cream soda, which I enjoyed.  It was on the sweeter side but delicious nonetheless.  The Matcha Latte was pretty good as well.  We would both come back and try other sandwiches and salads.  The drinks were to our satisfaction and it would be a nice sit-down spot to just have a drink and chat with friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's exactly what this area of town needed. Most of the coffee places around the Agincourt area are chains (Tim Hortons or Coffee Time), and Scarborough in general severely lacked proper cafés. BlackGold fulfills this void.   First off, I have to commend the service. All the employees I've spoken to so far have been very friendly. I've never had a rude experience so far, and I have high hopes that I probably never will. Plus, sometimes I get emails from BlackGold about specials, so that's nice.  Second, there is a really good variety of drinks and food here. While there were certain items that didn't suit my personal tastes, I could still tell that they were nice quality items. One that stands out in particular is this floral drink. I can't remember the name, but I think it had some mythological background to it. I thought the taste was very unique and that the presentation was aesthetically pleasing.   I just really like what BlackGold has brought to the area. Before the renovations happened, the building BlackGold is located in had almost no business. BlackGold sits where an old aquarium shop used to be. It's brought change to the area in a positive way, and I'm glad to see it happen."}
{"text":"Update to 4.5 stars! Came here around 7 or 7:30 yesterday evening and there were only 2 other people in the cafe. Got the leek-parmesan bistro as well as the spinach-feta again (always a goodie!) and it was so good! The raspberry white hot chocolate was very sweet, but beautiful.   Left very happy because of the great service, staff were very cheerful and amicable. The prices are still just maybe a dollar too high, which is why I still can't give this place a solid 5 stars, but it's well deserving of it. Great atmosphere, they had a Christmas tree up and little plastic trees and candles at each table, Christmas music playing quietly over the speakers. Definitely come by if you're within 10-15 minutes of this place."}
{"text":"A nice cafe in the Scarborough area that has the most instagrammable drinks. I went on a weekday morning and the cafe was quite empty and it was very easy to get a seat. By 10am, a few people had started to come in and it is clear that a lot of people like to come here for a drink and light snack and to get some work done. There are lots of tables and free WiFi so that you can do just that. Staff here are very friendly and warm.   I tried the raspberry hot chocolate and was a little worried that this would be one of those drinks that looked better than it tastes but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I really enjoyed the hot chocolate. The milk was perfectly frothed - creamy and smooth - and the hot chocolate wasn't overly sweet. On my first sip, I could definitely taste the raspberry flavouring, but after I mixed it in with the rest of the drink, it tasted a little more like Strawberry Quick (not that it's a bad thing).  The Cajun chicken sandwich was really good as well. It had two fairly thick pieces of chicken which were juicy and slightly spicy. The bread was nicely toasted and the tomatoes added a sweet freshness to the sandwich.  This cafe is a great addition to the Scarborough area. I will be back."}
{"text":"A new establishment, so it was promoting free small coffee or $2 latte.  This place also has free wifi.  The only thing is that there aren't many tables that have electrical outlets for laptops etc.   The menu is organized into hot and cold drinks.  I decided to order a \"Tea Elixir\", which is essentially green tea with mango flavour.   It's pretty tasty and fragrant.  There were food options as well for those who wanted to eat. The service was ok.  The associate serving me didn't really know the drinks too well, but that's understandable since it's a new shop.   I think as time goes on, the staff will be more knowledgeable and organized with experience.  I am happy with my drink today, so thank you for trying."}
{"text":"The place is cute and has a great atmosphere. Noise level is minimal - there were a couple of people doing work on their laptops and most others were in small groups of 2-3 people. I came here on a recommendation from a friend but I didn't enjoy it at all. My boyfriend ordered one of their signature sandwiches (I can't remember the name of it now) and I got a salad. Both were equally gross. My salad was pretty disgusting. The flavours didn't mesh well and it tasted like vomit. My boyfriend offered to switched dishes and I was so relieved. BUT, when I tried his sandwich, it was just as gross. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice place cool atmosphere and nice pastries / drinks. Not sure about the matcha green tea latte kinda tasted fishy but the London fog is to die for"}
{"text":"This place has a very nice vibe! The staff are super nice and has plenty of space to hang out or do some work. I had a latte and a roasted veggie salad. The latte and espresso tasted nice.   I decided to add chicken to my roasted veggie salad. The flavours were amazing and definitely a must-try if you're looking for a meal. The only downside is that it's a little pricey (around $12) - would be nice if they can reduce the prices in the future.   It's so refreshing to have indie coffee shops in Scarborough! I will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"It's a good sub place. I had the tuna sandwich but less mayo & the tuna is like dry. The chai  and Mancha latte taste good. I even ordered ice chai latte to go. They serve a large portion of everything. Staff is very courteous and nice."}
