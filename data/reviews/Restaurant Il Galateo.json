{"text":"My friends took me to a little gem of an Italian restaurant in Cote-Des-Neiges last evening. The decor is  classy but unpretentious, the service warm, friendly and helpful, and the food - a starter of penne arrabiata perfectly spiced, with a main of sea bass, tender and flavourful, accompanied by perfectly done veggies. A definite must try."}
{"text":"I went here with my parents on a quiet Saturday night. We were seated by an elderly gentleman, who I assume is the owner or manager. He was very polite and attentive. The food was alright. I ordered a penne arrabiata which was fine except I found a few pieces of spaghetti in it, which was a turn-off. The food also took a really long time to arrive, but we were served bruschetta and bread right away so we were able to wait for our food. Overall, the food was just OK for the price. The ambience and customer service was good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to the restaurant on our trip in Montréal. We were wandering where we have the last dinner in Montréal. We asked people working nearby café, and they suggested us to go to the restaurant. The restaurant was excellent. The atmosphere was comfortable, meals were delicious, and staffs were friendly. We had a great time thoroughly and were totally happy with everything we had here. If I get a chance to have dinner with someone in Montréal again, I definitely take them here again."}
