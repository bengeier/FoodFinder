{"text":"Ok realistically 3stars...bar tender was 5 stars, atmosphere was 5 stars...they had ammeter comedy night downstairs didn't go down but sounded like fun...but only appetizers after 10?? And they were ok not super...work on the food chef and this place could rock out!"}
{"text":"This review is based on a lunchtime visit.  Friendly and prompt service.  I have Never tasted a Better Veggie Black bean Burger anywhere."}
{"text":"P.J.'s is arguably the best-looking, most dignified establishment of the Kamm's Corners bar scene, but that's not to say that it doesn't get just as rowdy as some of the other bars. By day, it's family friendly and offers a menu that goes a step beyond standard bar food with substantial entrees and unconventional appetizers (offerings like Irish egg rolls set the tone for this Irish-themed and Irish-frequented place). I've had their wings and bruschetta, among other things, and have felt like their portions are generous and their ingredients fresh.

In terms of nightlife, live bands often grace the stage, back by the wall of stained glass set in dark wood that I have always suspected is there to bring about memories of church and rouse Catholic guilt, whether you were raised in the Catholic church or not. It's loud and usually crowded on the weekends and can even get pretty lively during a weekday evening. Once, when I was getting a beer after work, I marveled at the completely wasted gaggle of twentysomethings who were trying to take bar pictures for Facebook--you know, at six p.m. on a Wednesday.

That being said, I still enjoy P.J.'s, and just consider it to be a very West Park kind of bar, meaning it's pretty homogeneous in a white middle class kind of way. You can watch sports and bond over alumni connections from local schools and dance in the back, and it is what it is. The age demographic is mixed, however; I've seen argyle-clad women in their seventies dancing until last call before, and it's not unheard of for someone fresh out of college to be at the bar with their friends while their parents are socializing in another area.

I just wish the beer selection was larger and more varied--for a bar of its size, the tap choices can be relatively generic and redundant, compared to other bars that offer a wider range of microbrews and seasonals."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my parents when I'm home on leave or pass from the Army. I've had the Paddy Burger a time or two and haven't been disappointed. I think the last time they had a special on appetizers and I ordered the Reuben Dip for the four of us. That was really good with the boxty chips! I was quite amazed.

I wouldn't mind trying the All Day Irish Breakfast as the closest I had to something similar was an English Breakfast at the Rose & Crown in Itaewon, Seoul, South Korea. If PJ McIntyres is anything like that I'm sure I'll like it."}
{"text":"Passing through Cleveland and had s hankering for a great beer and some hearty food.  This place hit it out of the park.  Despite being fairly busy for Wednesday night, the single bartender handled business superbly!!  Will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I was at an event a few weeks ago at PJ's.  It is a neighborhood bar for me.  I had too much to drink.  I think some of the bartenders were unhappy that they were not getting tipped on an open bar.  I bought 2 beers after the open tab closed for $4.  I paid with a $100 bill.  I took the 2 beers to others and came back for my change.  Bartender claimed he put my $96 on the bar.  Not sure why a bartender would put $96 on the bar for someone that was not sitting at the bar before or after they got their drinks.  I come to find out this happens too often with certain bartenders at PJ's.  Be Careful."}
{"text":"Went there for trivia Wednesday, waste of time. Apparently it's considered humorous to take people's entry fees and hand them to your family and friends as prize winnings.
Chicken paprikash was served cold. 
Seating ergonomics are uncomfortable with too few proper bar stools and barrels instead of tables.
Glad they have customers, good luck to them."}
{"text":"Ahh - good ol' P.J. McIntyre.  I have my bf and his rugby team for showing me the ropes to this pub and am pleased to say that this has turned into my usual Saturday hangout thanks to rugby after-game socials.  

If you're looking for a place to just let loose, grab some beers, and stuff your face with some great grub (I'm a big fan of the Irish Egg Rolls), then head out to P.J.'s for a kickin' time.  I don't think I've ever been here when the place isn't packed (and not just with rowdy rugby guys) and the crowd is just filled with people who are ready to have a great time.  

Plenty of beers, a lot of room, a huge bar, and again - the food.  I've tried a variety of items on the menu and I've never had anything bad.  If you're craving great Irish and American bar food, this is your spot.  

And for you sports fanatics, there's always some sort of sport related game playing on one of the huge TV's and last year's OSU/Michigan game was watched here and it was a BLAST!  If you're a live music junky, they've got plenty of that, too.  From fun 80's cover bands to Carlos Jones  - they have it all.  So if you're in the mood to shake your groove thang, you may want to check out the event schedule because you won't be disappointed.  

Whatever your mood, P.J.'s will satisfy it.  They only thing left is to ask: what are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"Incredible service, delicious food and an awesome sound system.

I had called the owner, Patrick, earlier in the week to reserve a table for a party of 15.  This was for a busy Saturday night when they were hosting a popular band.  When I arrived, and was waiting for our tables, at least six people came up to me to see if I needed anything.  They are definitely well staffed!

Our server was Maggie. Although it was loud and packed, She always had a smile on her face AND she never looked stressed!  She is incredible and has her act together!!  After the initial drink order, I didn't need to remind her of what I was drinking when ordering subsequent drinks...and she didn't have our names! She checked on us many times throughout the evening! Patrick is lucky to have her!

I ordered the Guinness meatloaf.  It arrived hot and it was delicious!  Homemade mashed potatoes and just enough gravy.  My friends ordered burgers, wraps and appetizers.  I think its safe to say, all was tasty and satisfying.

The band Faction was lots of fun.  The music was a good mash of 80's to current.  As the evening went on, tables were removed to provide a dance floor...and dance we did!!

Before we wrapped up the evening, we were already discussing our return.

Thanks for a fun night, P.J. McIntyres!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at one of West Parks traditional Irish Pub.  Clean friendly pub with great tasting pints. Ordered the chicken caesar wrap with delicious homemade chips and I had another pint:). What a great place to enjoy spirits music and pub fare. Enjoyed great times with good friends and had another pint ;)  I will be back again and again. The staff was friendly and courteous. A must stop for all."}
{"text":"The pot roast was superb. The mashed potatoes were served with the perfect texture of gravy. The broccoli was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"After many visits to The Harp, we tried P.J. McIntyre's for a change.  We went on Sunday, June 16th. Another reason we chose P.J.'s because when we checked out the on-line menu at The Harp we were a bit disappointed in the price raising that had taken place.

Upon entering the pub, you walk in to a large, rectangular bar with long rails on both sides.  The main dining area is in the back.  Though there is a back entrance, so some may say the front.  LOL!  We were sat by one of the waitresses and were handed a regular menu and a specials menu.  The pub has a nice feel to it and a good bit of ambiance.  It is nothing fancy, but has a real feel of a neighborhood joint!  Our waitress took our drink order first and then came back for our meal order.  All was done in an appropriate amount of time.  There are drink specials and dinner specials which is great!  The owners appear to want to provide value to their customers as well as make it reasonable to dine at.

My mom ordered the baby back ribs and I had the lobster bisque with fish & chips.  We also shared the Irish Egg Roll appetizer.  For drinks I had a Black & Tan and my mom the Miller Lite beer special ($2 for 23 oz.).  The beers were served correctly and were tasty!  The egg roll appetizer was very good.  My mom's ribs were plentiful and tasty!  A nice dry rub with a mild covering of wet sauce.  I swear it was 1.5 racks of ribs!  She finished a 1/2 a rack and was full.  The lobster bisque was very flavorful and my fish & chips was spot on!  The portion of cod I received was huge!  We had another meal from the take-home boxes.  We had to try their bread pudding and were glad we did.  It was awesome and a great ending to the meal!

Our bill was under $50 and would have been over $80 at The Harp with their new pricing.  It is sad to say because we love that place.  I think on future visits to Cleveland, P.J.'s will become a regular stop.  I really like the feel of the place and both the food and service were excellent.  Another place I'd love to relocate to my home town in Maryland..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a traditional neighborhood Irish pub with a great kitchen and even better prices, then you will find this place to be absolutely perfect.

It's not divey at all. Fast food, I was brave enough to try some new foods and loved them!! Their Black and Tan onion rings are a steal at 2.99. Their happy hour accommodates all tastes and is 7 days a week.

Happy to be new to this neighborhood and have such a great place"}
{"text":"The food was fair at best. The Menu said Lobster Bisque. Prove it. No lobster. I know a cream based soup. Bullshit! My wife had the fried perch sandwich. Very soggy. The whiskey BBQ wings were good and I got a dozen for the price,which was nice,
I guess if you stick to burgers you will be ok. 
We should have walked down to the Public House."}
{"text":"last week Danielle and i had dinner at PJ McIntyre's Irish Pub and the food was good. I had the All Day Irish Breakfast. I'd have liked the hash browns to be browned a bit more but every thing else was very good.
I had a great beer that I was sure I wouldn't like - Rochester Mill's Toasted Marshmallow Milkshake Stout. yum. 
i doubt i'll be back, however, as i am not a fan of the atmosphere. I don't like people standing around me drinking and chatting while i'm eating my dinner. i recognize this is a \"pub\" but it was a bit too much for me. who knows? never say never, i guess."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy PJ McIntyre's. The food has been excellent each time we've eaten there, and the service has always been friendly (although sometimes delayed at the bar area). 

Having traveled throughout Ireland multiple times, I can say that this pub really reminds me of some of the larger pubs I've been to. And, unlike many American-Irish 'pubs' that serve soggy bar food, the food here is GOOD! They definitely have an American spin on things, but they bring in Irish influences like rashers (Irish bacon similar to Canadian bacon), shepherd's pie, and fish and chips. The tables are well stocked with HP sauce and malt vinegar, which are a must at any respectable pub!

The decor is beautiful inside, especially the area where you may have session music players gather certain nights. There are lovely murals, stone work, tile floors with Celtic designs, and, of course, the odd Guinness memorabilia on the walls. It has just the right level of not too bright, not too dimly lit inside as well. The bar CAN get a bit loud and rowdy, so just keep that in mind for when you go for dinner in the evening. 

All in all, we definitely recommend this place and will come back with friends and family!"}
{"text":"This Irish pub is very cool looking and very enjoyable overal.  The prices are pretty reasonable and the decor is really great. Lots of cool Irish stuff all around! 

Food was quite decent. Nothing incredible but very solid and not too expensive, which was nice. Good appetizers, decent service. Our waitress messed up a bit and wasn't incredibly fast but no real issues. I will likely go back here, I really like the neighborhood and overall vibe."}
{"text":"really good Irish food in the best Irish atmosphere style bar I've ever been in. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and feel of this place and the food was absolutely fantastic - and oh yea, really nice staff too."}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review where I am confused. However I believe I must write something to understand my experience at PJ McIntyre. This may allow me to be a better person and appreciate more my fellow Irishmen.

I visited for lunch on the last day of February. The visit created a strange tedium with Saint Patrick Day next month. It was like I was groping myself under the bar and PJ McIntyre needed to berate my hapless visit . His effort may have been to negate the last day in the shortest month of the year. 

The waitresses were cheery with excitement sharing conversation with a local afternoon wine swiller about experiences that happen at the bar for the festive holiday. The large dwelling pub empty other than two younger ladies in college that were studying for an exam over a pint.

I ordered food. A reuben and buffalo chicken dip appetizer with tortilla chips. I can say the food was okay. I would not say it was good or bad. The menu is confusing. The options are good however there is not an identity to the pub. There are some items that are identified with a logo, celtic,  to indicate signature dishes. I don't like this practice at this restaurant or others. If location has an Irish theme people will understand details on their own I believe perhaps I am wrong. I will say that I have had a more creative Reuben sandwich. 

I imagine Rocky River suburbanites visiting this place for Ohio State football games, Guiness pours, and a dubious misappropriated nostalgia. I don't understand this place. If you have read Swift's Modest Proposal and understood his humor, this place may be difficult. You will have to pull the smiles inside. 

I may visit again and revisit my review to add another star. They advertise on their website as 'Cleveland Ohio's Most Authentic Irish Pub'. I favor the Old Angle or Harp for food, drink, and friends almost any day."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place after our meeting to stop and have a beer and smoke a cigar outside. This was a great Iris bar, with great food. Our waitress, Jessica, was awesome. I will go back when ever in Cleveland.  Thanks Jessica for your hospitality."}
{"text":"Had the Irish Boxty with corned beef. First time I had one. It was awesome! Pair it with a Guinness for a true authentic experience."}
{"text":"Good food but awful service. Went in for lunch and the waitress was not with it at all. She was rude the moment we walked in. We were the only people there and we had to wait a long time because none of the dishes were clean. Not only that, but I asked for soup and she never brought the soup. She was also suppose to bring out another side but she apparently forgot about that one too. I wouldn't go again simply because the service was so bad."}
{"text":"Never ate here. But the beer on draft was really warm. Selection of beer was decent.  Cool looking place with a huge bar. If I go again probably gonna stay away from draft and hope a bottle is a little colder."}
{"text":"Stopped by during the snow storm yesterday, ordered appetizers, the three burgers were cold, the ribs tasted recycled, the cheese sticks were very good, maybe the weather caused the kitchen to take the night off but  regardless it  was disappointing."}
{"text":"The server was great. The corn beef dinner was bland and the vegetables were not cooked. The spinach and artichoke dip had a strong lemon taste to it as well."}
{"text":"I may be a bit partial, because I live within walking distance of this place, but it is freaking. Awesome.  They have delicious food, and REALLY fresh barrels of Guinness.  Atmosphere in spades, and tons of great folks.  If you leave downtown Cleveland looking for a beer, you should stop here.  Seriously, go.

There is a really great main bar area with tables on the sides.  There is also a stage and they have some pretty decent live music.  There is also a basement that is available for parties.  Did I mention really fresh Guinness?"}
{"text":"There are plenty of faux Irish pubs littering the Cleveland area that think a tap of Guinness and some paper Irish flags are enough. Just because you call your bar Shandy McSomething's or the Gleaming Clover doesn't make for an Irish pub experience. Thankfully, P.J. McIntyre's gets the ambiance right. 

We walked in around 6pm on a Thursday and were greeted with a warm, inviting atmosphere. The centerpiece of the joint has to be the massive double-sided bar that runs the length of the room. It's' shaped like a giant oval, there are plenty of stools for weary, thirsty travelers and it doesn't have one of those really annoying lips that makes it hard to eat at. There's also a selection of tables and at the back of the space sets a fireplace that adds to the ambiance. You definitely get the sense that Ireland is the theme from the bar dividers complete with cut glass inserts to the Guinness barrel tables. It's a little kitschy but it works.

I'm not sure if they have table service or not since we weren't greeted when we walked in so we took a seat at the bar. Within about 5 minutes the bartendress approaced, drink orders taken and menus dropped off. The crowd wasn't exactly large but for an early weeknight there was a comfortable buzz in the air. The beer selection is definitely better than average with nearly 20 taps featuring the requisite Guinness, Harp, Bass etc. to a few notable craft selections like Great Lakes Christmas Ale (of course) and Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA (a personal favorite). I guess the atmosphere got to me because I opted for a Black & Tan to kick off the meal.

We decided that we'd go all out with our meal to really get a sense of the menu. Here's a rundown of our experience:

The Wedge Salad: We've had alot of wedge salads in our day so one develops expectations. This rendition was just OK. A nice share-worthy size it was essentially half an iceberg lettuce head, halved cherry tomatoes, cukes, ribbons of carrot (interesting), bits of real bacon and blue cheese dressing. It was fresh and tasty enough but did little more than it was asked. Oh yeah, and it was served on a warm plate. C'mon guys, that's salads 101.

Beer Cheese Bread - I expected this to be good. After all, how can you go wrong with melted cheese on bread? Six slices of what appeared to be garlic bread covered in bubbly orange cheese came served with a little cup of marinara for dipping. The menu states that the cheese has ale in it but I couldn't pick it up. Not a bad little snack.

The All Day Irish Burger - I believe that the true test of a bar kitchen is how well they cook their burgers. This particular burger comes topped with cheddar cheese, rasher (thin sliced ham-like bacon), LTO and a fried egg. I upgraded to the pretzel bun for a buck more. The meat was cooked perfectly with a nice char character and the seasoning was spot on. The dripping egg juices cascaded over the bacon and made for a nice in situ sauce. As they are expected to do, the pretzel bun just made it better. The generous portion of house chips was warm and crispy. Overall, I thought they did a great job. A solid burger.

Turkey Reuben (aka the Turkey Rachel) with Black & Tan Onion Rings - My wife opted for this classic pairing - sliced turkey breast, Swiss cheese and cole slaw on marble rye. The menu states \"thick cut\" marble rye but I thought it was on the thin side. Check out the pic and judge for yourself. The turkey was tender and flavorful but the sandwich as a whole was very dry. Maybe some more \"juiciness\" to the slaw, which in this case was merely undressed sliced cabbage and carrots, would help. The rings were crispy but underseasoned and I really dug the beer batter. I'm not too sure what the stripes of brown were that decorated the rings but I didn't think they brought much to the party.

Our experience at P.J. McIntyre's was a good one. It's a warm and cozy respite that serves tasty and affordable food with an Irish bent. The service was friendly albeit a bit long between drinks and the food, while not mind-blowingly awesome left me full and satisfied. Me thinks I just might wander in again..."}
{"text":"Hello P.J. McIntyre's. I know I visited you this past summer, but somehow I forgot until now to write a review about you. 

Don't worry. It's nothing against you or anything. I think i just got busy and it slipped my mind. Although I have no idea how...

Your atmosphere and general \"sweet-as-hell Irish pub\" feel made me feel strangely at home for a bar I've only been to once. You housed a hot, tired and hungover group when we were tired of walking around the screaming children at Kamm's Corner Fest. You were a shelter from the sunny afternoon and offered a rather fantastic 'hair of the dog\" remedy to my stomach ache in the form of glorious beer. In essence? A savior. 

So, it's become essential for me to spread the news of this unpretentious, hardwood embellished, Irish pub that rocks. I haven't tried the food, but I'll be back soon to do so. Especially after hearing Murray utter the words \"soft\", \"pretzel\",  and \"cheese\" in the same sentence. Plus, those black and tan onion rings didn't sound too bad either. 

Also, when I return can you please arrange for that 45 year old drunk woman to be right behind me at the bar again? She was hilarious and was totally sloshed when she was supposed to be watching her daughter's baton routine in the parade. I gave her a high-five. She made my night. 

If you're reading this leave with this thought embedded in your brain: Soft pretzel loaf with cheese... mmmmmmmmm....."}
{"text":"Cleveland has a lot of little Irish Pubs.  The one thing that I think that is good about this place is indeed the food and the beer selection.  I have eaten here a few times and was never disappointed (fish and chips are yum, but I realize that is what I always get at Irish pubs).

The staff is indeed friendly, and the service is good overall.  Sometimes you have to wait longer than you like (depending on how busy they are).

The nice thing about this place (and many others) is it is not trying to be something it is not (like the commercial Irish pubs) and comes across as more authentic. I know a lot of people who still frequent here and they too enjoy the ambiance and the vibe."}
{"text":"Tried PJ McIntyre's on a Thursday night recently.  Although we were self-seated and greeted at out table promptly, it was pretty much downhill from there.

Food: Irish egg roll app was solid.  Mains were hit and miss - the fish and chips was pretty good, but my meatloaf appeared to have been leftovers.  It was also so burnt/overcooked on the top that parts of it were inedible.  There was also no vegetable served (just mashed potatoes), which I found a little odd.  Grade: C

Service: friendly, but we were left unattended for long stretches when food/drinks were to be ordered.  In addition, two meals came on time, but the other three did not arrive for about 15 minutes.  Some excuse was given, but nothing was done to rectify the situation.  Grade: D-

Overall grade: D/D+  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Beers, great...great selection.  If you want to get drunk, by all means, check out PJ's.  As for food, make other plans.  I've given PJ's more than a few chances and tonight takes the cake.  I ordered the strip steak, medium.  It was cooked perfectly, however all I tasted was that burned char taste with every bite and had to dunk each bite in A1.  The baked potato had that day old flavor.  Yuk.  I love PJ's...but it's a bar, not a restaurant.  I've been coming here since they opened, back when they let you bring in pizza's etc from the outside, before the kitchen opened.  They should go back to that."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local bars! While the place is usually packed (most times, I cannot find a seat in the place), it is worth it! The atmosphere is great! They often have irish music or bands playing on the stage and traditional Irish features. It's pretty large inside and they gather a large crowd. The patio is nice during the summer. I recently tried the food and the wings are outstanding! I would highly recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Gorgeous Irish Pub! Super close to the airport/ rental car area, and so easy to get to. There is outdoor seating available, but the inside is BEAUTIFUL! Better yet - the Guinness is a close to authentic as my husband has had in the States. Most entrees are in the $11-14  range. The food was great too - the potato pancake dish was yummy and and Shepards pie was to die for!"}
{"text":"Fun little bar, I came a few years ago for St Patricks day. Wanted some corned beef and cabbage. It was decent, nothing amazing. Stopped in today after an emergency room visit with my niece. Good bar food, nothing really Irish authentic. If you're a big drinking and okay with mediocre bar food. This is definitely the place for you.

Meh, I doubt I'll return again. I'm not much of a drinker and literally was stuck in the bathroom for an hour when I got home."}
{"text":"Service was great, waiter was very friendly and gave honest opinions on the entrees that were very descriptive. I had the Boxty my husband had the ribs both were great. Portions were huge and my glass was never empty. I will be back."}
{"text":"Great service! Wings were Eh. Ribs were dry. Salad was OK."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. There were 5 of us. Everything we ordered was overcooked, even though we ordered burgers at medium. My burger was burned so bad I had to send it back. (The re-do was much better) Steak fries were mushy and tasteless. The chicken club was meh.  Service was slow...although they were nice. It was a Monday night and not busy. Won't return."}
{"text":"I used to not like coming here while everyone else did, but that has changed.  Went on a Friday evening and was truly blown away by how good my food was!

Expanded menu from my previous visit The service was great! Beer was fresh and not overpriced, so that wins in my book.

Always enjoy the atmosphere but they mailed it this time, I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Oh, P.J.'s how I love thee.  Let me count the ways.  Your bartenders always pour the perfect pint of Guinness, Smithwicks and Harp along with other Irish and non-Irish beers.  Your food is great, especially if you like traditional Irish pub grub.  Fish and chips heck yes!  The decor is straight out of Ireland.  The inside looks nicer than many pubs I've spent time in in Ireland.  

The owners have put a ton of work into P.J.'s and you can tell.  I'm kind of surprised that it isn't packed every-time.

Make sure to check out P.J's on a Friday or Saturday night.  They have usually have live music, manytimes of the Irish variety.  I've seen my favorite Irish band...Shindig play here many times!"}
{"text":"How have I not written a review on Pj's yet?!  Pat has a great thing goin here.  Great bands, great beer and great food.  Come on a Sunday morning and youll see all the old Irish guys watching hurling.  The peat fire, along with the folks in there is the closest youll get to actually being in Ireland.  Great food and they always have great daily specials.  $2 domestic drafts and .40 curry wings are a good combo.  Whiskey Thurdays are always fun too.  The only downside for me is the neighborhood.  Its very incestual.  Everyone has family on Achill Is and looks exactly the same.  Very weird.  The guys all still think there in high school football and the women should buy stock in Old Navy tech vests and Uggs.  There is two crowds here, the Old Irish guys in the morn and the cookie cutter, Michelobe Ultra \"West Park\" crowd.  I prefer the first option.."}
{"text":"You always support friends, but when friends support you, you double up. Great community involvement, and always the feel of home. 
Fish fry is fantastic, turkey club on pretzel roll is my fav and Smithwicks is always cold. Staff are friendly, remember your name and  your drink and not afraid if a chat. 
My fav hangout."}
{"text":"I have been there twice in the last two months for lunch during work and it was very good. I got the Rueben Briggsy both times and that is some tasty corned beef. Also their homemade chips are really great. 
The only downside for me, as an asthmatic, is the fireplace. While I love the ambiance it provides, they put peat on the fire and it takes me a good 15 minutes to get adjusted to the heavy fragrance. As long as I have my inhaler, I'm solid. 
If you like Hogwarts and anything English  / Old World you will really love the large stone fireplace and the overall feel of the restaurant. I'm even looking into throwing a birthday party there :)"}
{"text":"A pleasant place to hang out at and drink beer. Bartenders work hard."}
{"text":"I partied here this past St. Pat's Day and everyone was feeling real good. Kamm's area, in general, is becoming a good spot for the region. PJ's is my spot whenever I feel like hanging with friends and enjoying myself in a good Irish neighborhood. Not worthy of 4 stars. That's reserved for primo spots. That's how I roll."}
{"text":"Great looking bar- probably my favorite neighborhood place. Not a fan of the food here though (think frozen burger patties- not sure if they actually are but it tasted like preformed frozen to me), but a nice place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Great Music. Guinness, need I say more?

Usually crowded, get there early."}
{"text":"Fabulous. I love this place. The inside is so cozy and comfortable.  The bartenders and servers are typically attentive and have never had any issues with the service. They have specials EVERY DAY on food and drinks. Happy hour is every day from 11-7pm (except Sunday's *think* it starts at 3 on Sundays..?) The specials are always different, so you don't have to do the same thing every day (if you were to go here every day..!). Another thing that this place has a lot of--events. They have their schedule of events out a month ahead of time: you can either find the list at the bar or on their web site. I go here a couple times a year to see two different bands play. I go early, have dinner, and then they move a lot of the tables right before the band starts to have some sort of dancing area. It's a pretty good time.

I went here once on a Wednesday for the chicken paprikash night--VERY good. Not as spicy as my moms, but it was still good, and something I would definitely order again. What appetizers do I recommend? Buffalo chicken dip, beer cheese bread, black and tan onion rings, chicken tenders (the sauce is sooo good). Main dish? The Paddy Burger is a definite must. Yummy. One of the waitress's recommended it to me one time when I was there and I am so glad she did. I had the same waitress a second time (Emily) and she actually recognized my boyfriend and I which was very cool. 

There is a huge parking lot behind the place with a back entrance. This place is so warm and fun and is definitely worth it for you to check out."}
{"text":"Pj McIntyre's. My go to west park bar. I've been here many a night, and for some reason there is always a drunken almost brawl near me. Even when no one else is in the bar. Its totally bizarre-o. Not complaining, just stating a fact. There's always entertainment :D 

     I've only eaten at PJ's once, but their brunch was  amazing. \"Two eggs, hash browns, black and white puddings, bangers, rashers, grilled tomato, baked beans, mushrooms, and toast\". Delish. I loved the brunch. I also love that they make the correct black & tan. Guiness and Smithwicks. Don't mess with it. 

    If you're looking for a nicer place to go in the west park area, Pj's is definitely it."}
{"text":"Always consistent.  Food is good. Staff is attentive, and busy.  Atmosphere is somewhat noisy, but that's ok.  It's a bar/restaurant.  Good neighborhood spot"}
{"text":"PJ's is a great establishment and t's a perfect spot for a chill night out amongst friends having dinner and a few drinks.  My two favorite aspects of PJ's are probably the obvious. 1) They have some of the best specials in the area, every night of the week there's an awesome special, be it taco night, ribs, buffalo everything, or perch - you seriously can't go wrong.  And the food is solid, much akin to upscale bar food, which is fine by me as well as perfectly paired with a Guinness or whiskey, neat.  2) The atmosphere is unique and alot of fun - the architecture is Irish pub-like with an almost medieval castle-esque ambience, which I dig.  As I opened with, if you want to go out for a chill night with friends, eat some good food for a deal, knock back a few pints, all while most-likely listening to a live irish band- stop on by PJ's."}
{"text":"We just came from PJ's - First time visit. Day: Monday Time: 6:30pm(ish) Crowd: Families - surprising amount of younger children. Fortunately, all well behaved. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is two reasons - this was our first time visit, and I like to go at least 3 times at various times/days to test the waters. Service was pretty good considering a rather big Monday night flow, and it appeared there was one lone server who got someone not in uniform to help her. Had that person not pitched in and helped, she'd have been swamped. Plus I want to go back and sit at the bar, and sample their variety of beverages. (Magars and Strongbow on draft? Yes please.)

As an appetizer (on special for $5) my dining companion chose the Reuben Dip. We both expected it to be served with something like crackers or who knows. We were surprised by the huge portion - a crock of dip served all around it with what I think were flat-pressed triangles of potato pancakes, that had been grilled. Um... yes?!

I had read reviews on Yelp and Google that mentioned the generous portions and it looked like that was being confirmed. I don't mind spending money, but I like to *get* something for my dollar, like anyone. Lately, I've been craving fish and had also read it was great here  ---- let me tell you those reviews are NOT wrong. The fish & chips was terrific!!! (**** Fresh haddock, battered and fried, served  with steak fries, tartar sauce and coleslaw  12.99 ****) The fries were run of the mill,  but the fish, omg, the fish. We're talking at least a 1/2 pound breaded, deep fried piece of haddock - but it wasn't Long John Silvers ew greasy deep fried, no way. It was awesome! I usually request a lot of lemons and kind of have some version of lemonade fish, but to my delight (and as any Irish place should) they had malt vinegar on the table. On the fish, it was just the right addition. 

My dining companion got the \"Paddy Burger\" (****Smoked bacon,  cheddar, Black & Tan  onion rings and  Bushmills Irish whisky  BBQ sauce  8.99  ****) and it was cooked just as  he'd requested - the patty itself was pretty thin, so kudos for getting the medium-rare correct. He really liked the Black & Tan onion rings on the burger. He got the homemade chips with his order, and they were rather unimpressive. I've had better of those from local places. But we weren't there for the chips. I had to laugh because he kept eyeballing my fish and saying how big a portion it was - and that he'd have to get it next time. And believe it that there will be a \"next time\".

One other complaint on this night was parking. There is a lot out behind that I think is shared with several other businesses along the row with PJ's. That was all full - so we got a place on the street. With all the snow and ice, I had to walk close to the cars *in* the street, so not the best choice. I can see how on a Friday or Saturday night parking could be a problem. Still, it's worth bitching about the parking to go back and try other menu and drink options. I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"You know, I didn't think I would like this place, but I do. The food is really good, and so are the drinks. The bartenders are knowledgeable, and unobtrusive, which can be more important than you think! They do need to add some more choices of gin, though."}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for a long time as i've heard they invested tons of money into this venture. It looks it. Probably the most gorgeous bar/ eatery within a three mile radius. Not overly Irish, just kind of British Isles-ish. Like the Pub in Rocky River, but not fake. Amazing woodwork abounds in this warm space(stole that from the Sunday morning real estate show). There is a long central bar, a fireplace to gather round, cozy booths, a long banquet table and several bar height tables perched on top of barrels. The table top was a shiny lacquered old Guinness toucan logo. So cool. That is where my wife and i sat. The outdoor option to sit right at the corner of Lorain and Rocky River drive was tempting, but the air conditioning won out.

I ordered a draught Newcastle(duh, my fave ale). The bartender had an Irish accent. Ladies, feel free to swoon. The wife asked me if it was real or did he have to pretend just to work there. Good question. It was past ten and the kitchen was only open for apps. Worked for me. We had black and tan onion rings and soft pretzel with cheese sauce. Rings were good, but OMG those pretzels!! They came as two mini loaves instead of the traditional design. They were awesome.

We want to make it our regular hangout. Very inviting, unpretentious and we call it PJ Calamity's(Mean Girls reference)."}
{"text":"Are you of Irish decent?  If so stop reading and just go because this place has a great pub theme, Guiness, and food you will love!

The beer selection is average, the bar is huge, the seating is nice, service is better than slow, clean bathrooms, nice Pub theme, and live music at times.    

The crowd can be a bit young on the weekend nights.  You get a mix of 30 and 40 somethings with 20 somethings getting drunk. During happy hour it's more of a professional crowd.

I gave it 4 stars because there is nothing i dislike about this place. Normally that means 3 stars from me but i think most people will enjoy going here. 

You won't rant and rave about the place but you will go back.  Great area and amazing place in the summer.  

A must stop on St. Patrick's day regardless of the crowd size."}
{"text":"I just started coming to this area because a friend recommended it to me. There are many establishments to choose from, and I'm very happy that we stumbled upon this place. We got there right when they opened, so we got a chance to talk with the bartender who was super friendly. First of all.....lets talk about the happy hour. 11am to 7pm? You can't beat that! We were there on a Thursday which is craft beer day. All bottle selections are 3 bucks. Oh yeah..... It was time to order food to soak up the alcohol I was about to consume! 

We started off with the reuben dip. Make sure you order this next time you go here. Not so much for the dip itself, but for the boxty chips!  Wow. They were tasty. And they serve you a ton, so I got to take some home with me. They are even good cold. 

I am a sucker for lobster bisque. If it's on the menu, I order it. I'm glad I did.  The flavor is spot on. My only gripe is that I believe they put those fake crab sticks in it instead of real lobster. I didn't really mind because the flavor of the bisque is so good. 

Finally, we split the fish and chips. We only ate a couple of bites being so full from everything else, but this was very good as well. 

I have to apologize to the other restaurants in the area. It will be very difficult to try any of them when I'm in the area because this is my new \"go to\" place!"}
{"text":"If you are in the area, stop by this place immediately! After driving for awhile with my family on a road trip, we really wanted some [good] Irish food. Needless to say, this place really hit the spot. The food was delicious, the place looked great, and the service was wonderful. Did I mention the food was delicious? If only there were more wonderful places like this to eat, I would be one happy foodie."}
