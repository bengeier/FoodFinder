{"text":"A refreshing, homey change from some other bland juiceries in the city.  The joint has a clean, slick vibe with some cool original art.  A great place to check out before/after work or a workout."}
{"text":"The dude who served me was super polite and the juice was great. Barely any pulp sediment AND very beetrooty! A winning combo. Yum."}
{"text":"This place is great. And I say that as someone who generally disapproves of juice bars. It's decent priced, juice is all really good, fresh ingredients and a good size for what you pay for. It's run by a super chill nice young dude and it's nicely laid out and a nice place to hang out. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Try it after seeing it on my friends Instagram, since we went out of our way to try it, we expected more. It was good value for the money, approx. $13 for a big litre of juice. However, we were hoping they would use more veggie or fruits instead of too much coconut water. I tried a couple of other juice places, and I felt that flavours here were lacking. No wow factor, but good value for money."}
{"text":"Juice places are a dime a dozen but the owner of Anti Vice, Joe has crafted some seriously unique and tasty blends. The prices are also amazing compared to a lot of other west end juiceries.  Definitely try the Outer Beauty which has carrot, kiwi, strawberry, lime, red clover and dandelion. They also have an amazing tea selection carefully concocted for both taste and health benefits. Now college street Vams Kombucha fans can also get their favourite fermented tonics right around the corner. And free WiFi makes it a great place to hang and chill all day. Aces."}
{"text":"Great quality product, reasonable price. Just wish they were opened a little later for ppl coming off of work and on their way to the gym right beside, they would profit from staying open that extra hour. Also good to know they deliver  online through foodora!"}
{"text":"My favorite juicery in the city. Great location, friendly staff, fun new products, and most importantly delicious juice!"}
{"text":"Kind quiet funky hip nifty healthy holistic space and stuff... the sandwich board occasionally draws me to stroll in for some foodmedicine."}
{"text":"My purdy posse normally trolls Dundas when walking this stretch of the west, but this past weekend after a park jaunt, we hit up college. I'm sure glad we did. We popped into Anti Vice for some fresh watermelon juice and instantly fell in love with this little, minimalist shop. Pick up a reasonably priced (for the quality) fresh pressed juice or some personal products (teas, natural beauty products) and have yourself a fine afternoon."}
