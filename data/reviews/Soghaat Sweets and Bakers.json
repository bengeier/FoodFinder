{"text":"Very friendly service, and lots of options to choose from. The sweets are great as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful service each time I have visited. Love the layout and design, it feels very spacious. I've only had the desserts and cookies so far, and they always taste nice and fresh."}
{"text":"They have some nice Pakistani methai options, Ghulab Jaman, Amrati, maisu and chum chum I would say better than bismillah sweets     They need to improve on chicken patties,  lacks layers and proper baking (if the owner is reading) white Rus gula had a burnt flavour. Baloshahi was really bad    Beef parties were really good.   Shop ambiance is just amazing."}
