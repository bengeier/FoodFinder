{"text":"What a relief.  

Got used to the trash that KFC puts out two blocks away.

Finally a place that does it right.  Ordered a Family Dinner and it was great.  Even three days later the left over chicken was good.

Only issue not giving 5 stars is the corn on the cob had been sitting there a while.  Tried to give it to the dogs and even they turned away - just does not happen virtually ever."}
{"text":"Should be rated zero order the shrimp meal got a few pieces of shrimp and a hair with my order wtf .... wouldn't go there again .... plus the girl working the drive through had a little attitude ....."}
{"text":"Ordered dinner with ubereats and it was a great experience! We ordered the friends and family special with a side of biscuits and coleslaw. The chicken and biscuits were delish! So fresh and tasty. The coleslaw was pretty bland, not enough seasoning and not tangy like I'm used to coleslaw being. Still worth a visit/order!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something different today so we stopped here and after an unusually long wait time we got our food and went home. It's the worst day food we have had since we moved here. Just threw it all in the trash. A waste 20$."}
{"text":"I mean, I'm not expecting much but...

1. Ask for honey bbq sauce, they gave me buffalo.  
2. Ask for extra gravy, didn't get any.
3. The wings were UNCOOKED  on the inside!!

Feel like I need to spend hundreds  of dollars on doctor bills to check for salmonella after $15 meal."}
{"text":"Fast service. I love getting food here for dinner. I always go through the drive-thru, I have not been in the restaurant at all so I'm just commenting on my experience with drive thru. They always have good deals too. Today, I got 12 pieces of chicken with 2 sides of mashed potatoes. Also got a gallon of water!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. They don't even deserve 1 star. The girls there are not friendly. They always \"ran out\" of something when it's close to closing time. And if you ask to have a fresh one made they noticeably seem annoyed. I walked in tonight thinking the same girls wouldn't be there still...they are. I walked right back out to another location."}
{"text":"Oh how we need negative stars available on here. Church's tastes nothing like it used to like I remember when I was younger. Went there a few weeks back and haven't returned and won't. Ordered chicken strips, fries and mac n cheese. That was a mistake. The chicken had a weird taste to it and the fries were soaked with what tasted like rancid cooking oil. The mac n cheese was runny and bland. I don't get why there are so many Church's locations. If anything there should be more Popeyes."}
{"text":"Church's Chicken is one of the unfamiliar franchise name I wouldn't have known or heard of in SF. But Las Vegas has abundance of fast food franchises I m just gettin to be familiar with or enjoy. Church's Chicken is quite similar to what Popeye's has to offer in menu n flavor wise! But I think Church's Chicken is a little less greasier n healthier!"}
{"text":"worst service ever!!!!!!!!!! spent one hour waiting on my order......wtffffffff!!!!!!!!  they argue with each other, and ask you what you ordered twice and then still say the wrong order back..... what kind of chicken place has no white meat???????  After all of that, the food sucks.  I'm done."}
{"text":"Horrible location staffs dirty place is disgusting they don't have biscuits and spicey chicken ever messed up orders over and over half the crew isn't wearing hairnets and multiple had very long hair mid back level defiantly getting reported to the bbb"}
{"text":"If you know of a place with fried chicken that's not greasy but full of flavor, please let me know. I mean, if you are looking for healthy, you don't start looking at something that starts with the word \"FRIED\". I found this chicken tasty, but not dripping with fat. Better than KFC by far."}
{"text":"I only gave one star because if I could have given zero I would have. The people that work in the Drive-Thru and there's restaurant are the slowest people on earth. And when they get your order wrong they try to make you wait a long time seriously they should fire everyone in the store and start fresh"}
{"text":"Stopped here a few days ago for lunch.  I was a car behind the one ordering at the speaker in the drive-thru with 2 more ahead of them. 5 minutes later the front car finally pulls out and I go up to order. I couldn't understand the employee and she could not understand me so I had to pretty much wait till I got to the window to order which is when she told me what I wanted would take about 10 minutes to come out. I noticed the car that was at the front of the line still sitting off to the side waiting so I decided against it. I can't comment on the good, but the drive thru service was painfully slow/non-existent. They also don't have much of a value meal menu and some of their meal prices are pretty high. I wouldn't recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I have always loved church's chicken since I fell in love with Fried Chicken.  KFC never got my admiration.  Popeyes is an after thought.  But when I went to THIS church's on Rainbow blvd in Las Vegas, I was beyond dissapointment!  The management was ignorant.  The chicken was not seasoned as it should be.  It tasted like greasy non-flavored flour wrapped around a wasted piece of sad chicken.  It's Popeyes for me now or I'll drive to Spring mountain Rd for the good Church's chicken!!  If you live around Rainbow blvd, Take the drive to Spring Mountain Rd for REAL Church's chicken!

{"text":"Very rude girls working here ! Then We got served dry chicken and greasy biscuits  food was really gross, will never ever return to this or any other churches!!!"}
{"text":"I hope you have a lot of time to spare because the service at this place is the slowest I have ever seen.   Lots of people complaining about cold food and wrong orders.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I am pretty disappointed in this Church's Chicken location. I went on 7/29/14  to buy dinner for my family. I used the drive thru. I ordered the 20 strips meal and the woman at the window and on the speaker was very rude. I was not greeted. I was not offered any sauce for the strips I ordered and I waited at the window with no knowledge of what was going on for over 10 minutes. I spent $34.58 on dinner for my family or so I thought. My receipt said $34.58 but my card was charged $41.50! The meal was only $31.99 + tax. I could have easily gone to ANY other fast food chain and spent far less than that. I am taken back by the way I was treated and I have no desire to return. While I have always enjoyed the food from Church's, I'm not willing to accept poor customer service (stating it mildly). 

**Update** 
I was contacted by someone from the store who said she was not the owner but would be handling the complaint.  She proceeded to tell me that the incorrect charge was my banks fault and they accept no responsibility for it.  She offered no apology and no compensation for my trouble.  I will be escalating the complaint with the Corporate Customer Service department today @ 866-345-6788.  Needless to say, CHURCH's has lost  my business and hopefully with social networking, the business of several others.  This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"No rating preferably but it doesn't give me that option. This place sucks! I would want this place shut down and have another food joint replace it. The wait is ridiculously long. Worser than any another fast food place I've ever had to wait for. 

Whats the point of having a fast food joint if your not doing the job right quickly. Gtfo!"}
{"text":"Crawling with bugs! It was definitely not my first time here, but the first time to see the bugs! There was 3-8  roaches at a time coming out of the wood. We told the staff and they said, \"The manager is here, there is nothing we can do.\""}
{"text":"This place is terrible! 9 out of 10 times they are out of spicy chicken.   When you ask why they are always out, you get a snarky reply \"cause every one orders it\".  We'll no duh!! Maybe you should make more of it!!!

I've driven away from this place without ordering for last time.  I can't imagine how much business this place is losing because they fail to plan.  Whoever is in charge of planning for the dinner rush needs to be fired."}
{"text":"I will NEVER go to this location of Church's again!! All I wanted after coming home from a long day at work, was to swing by and grab dinner for my family, so we could all sit down and enjoy dinner together. I spent over $45 for our whole family. While in the drive-thru, the employee was upset with me because I held up the line because I ordered fried okra and it was going to take a little longer. He was rude and rolled his eyes when I asked for more napkins!! When I got home, we sat down for dinner, only to realize the chicken strips I ordered were NOT THERE!!!!! I drove back to the restaurant and when I got there, there was no one in line. The guy that helped me in the drive-thru, saw me walk in and walked to the back of the store! I stood there at the counter for 5min before he came and said sarcastically \"what did we forget?\" I was so taken back by his attitude! He gave me my chicken and I left...no apology or anything!!! Never in my life have I been treated so badly by an employee at a restaurant. Of course when I got back home to have dinner with my family, everyone else was done eating.. :( I will never go back, and I advise everyone else to avoid it as well."}
{"text":"This is the worst church's chicken I've been to in my life. I think they are embezzling money from the sides.

I went to, well first I searched for a Church's chicken. 

Once at churches I ordered  2 5$ meals.
The young cashier charged me for a extra side. When I asked about the extra charge he laughed and said \" sir you ordered the extra sides,\" 
I know I didn't I was on a budget..

So he said \"I'll refund it,\" in a smart disrespectful attitude, then after he gave me a weird look, so I decided to refund the whole meal before it came to the window..

Then I said \" may I speak to your mananger\"?

He said \"who my mom\"? Then laughed at me again, then he said \"Mom drive through\".

Once she arrived she said \"what's the problem?\" I tried telling her, but she wasn't listening, she had made up her mind that she was taking sides of the employee )aka her son) with out even hearing me out.. 

At this point I advised her I would yeLp her and this establishment. 
She said \" I don't care go for it\" 

The managers name is Alma Sandoval.

Her disrespectful son was working register.

I will never go here again until that family crew is fired!

This was my first and last visit!"}
{"text":"This place does not deserve 1 star it just wouldn't let me....We went through drive thru. and asked to do 2 seperate orders said no what is your order? We were like so is she going to take second order?Got to window asked for manager,she said she was and asked why we couldn't do 2 seperate orders she said messes up their time..! Is that all they care about? They said basically the car behind us could not be held up..Guess what just went to Popeyes and spent 80.00 between 2 orders.Lost Sales and also time putting food back.How is that for time,was it worth it?"}
{"text":"I went to Church's Chicken Drive- thru on Rainbow between Robbindale and Windmill, and was waited on immediately.  The lady was very nice, polite and got my order correct - she even remembered my BBQ sauce!  I could tell at the window that customer service was important to her.  This was refreshing since I had just walked into a Popeye's Chicken place and was completely ignored like I was invisible - that was very hurtful.  Church's will get lots of our business from now on!  Thanks for your good service."}
{"text":"Spicy and Extra Crispy

Looking for Cajun style fried chicken.  Staff are friendly.  I had to wait extra long for my order one time, but manager apologized and gave extra chicken pieces and biscuits.  Opt for the extra crispy and spicy chicken."}
{"text":"This place is bad. Like really bad...I was one of the two parties being served and there was chaos in the kitchen, not sure why. There were boxes of all kinds scattered on the floor, plastic bags, etc. Zero cleaninless and organization. Someone out of uniform (Owner?) was sneezing all over the place, yes, without covering his face. I opted for not ordering after seen this disaster."}
{"text":"Went through the drive in and ordered the \"spicy\" chicken leg and thigh special. What a mistake. Chicken was so old that it was chicken jerky and it took a long time to get the order. I contacted the store but didn't get any reply. Save your money and time."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Church's location for many years now and they have the very best chicken in the area. Sometimes you have to wait while they fry up \"fresh\" chicken but that's because they sell a lot of chicken. Older location in old town Glendale, parking lot could use some pavement but the chicken is the best. Staff is tired but friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Today's meal was not very good. The chicken was too dry and cooked too long. I was told it was more than two days ago that the oil was changed.  I have found high-quality meals in the stores in Goodyear and ."}
{"text":"Whenever me and my brother go Church's; their chicken has been very fresh so far. This includes their food not being salty. It always been hot so far.  The customer service is good  also.  They always offer us a drink while we wait. Keep up the good work Churh 's."}
{"text":"It was pretty dAmm good and cheaper than the McDonalds across the street which in my opinion the worst mc Donalds ive ever been to"}
{"text":"Forgot to bring my lunch from home. Presented the online coupon from their website for 2 pcs leg/thigh meal with a biscuit and sm mash potatoes. After waiting for a long time, male employee gave me the order with the sauces I asked for. I was in a hurry and asked for a fork. This employee said he had already put it in the bag. I'm like ok great thanks! I was eating my food at work break room and couldn't find the mash potato and fork!!! I called the restaurant. He said that he didn't notice that mash potato was included! I was like you want ms to send you a screenshot? Or go to your website; it's there! He said he would be glad to give it to me as long as I come back and present my receipt with all the food I already have. Are you kidding me? I only had 30 mins of break and you want me to spit my food and present a missing receipt due to your printer running out of receipt paper?! I was like forget it! Not worth my time! I hate this! Go somewhere else where employees are not slow and not incompetent! Ugh!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this location for the past 3 years. We live out in Buckeye and only \"chicken\" place out there is KFC. We prefer Churches but will reconsider after this last visit. I went through the driver through, the girl asked what I would like. I asked her to give me just a moment as my daughter was asking for something different this trip. She again asked me what I would like. I had to repeat myself and ask her to give me just a moment. Once we decided on what we wanted to order I asked the person if they were ready to take our order. .......Silence..... I had to ask two more times before anyone responded. She took my order without any complications surprisingly. I drove up to the window and she was there to accept my payment. After paying we waited 27 minutes before she came back to the window with our food. By that time there were 4 additional cars behind me so I drover around to the front to check our order, because they always get you in the drive through!!! I had ordered jalapeno's with our chicken and she didn't put them in the bag. I parked and went inside to get them. I told \"Danesha\" that she had forgotten our jalapeno's in our order. She looked at me bewildered and said \"do you have your receipt?\" At that point is when I became very agitated. I told her I was just in the driver through and she said \"okay!\" I went out to my car and got the receipt. Came back in and tossed the receipt on the counter. She looked at it then turned around and pulled the jalapeno's out of the cooler and threw them across the counter at me. I had a few choice words for her and told her I would be contacting management the next day and she said \"SO\". After leaving the store I called to speak with the manager on duty. Well Danesha answered the phone and when I asked to speak to a manager she gave the phone to a coworker named Nelsy and she claimed to be the manager but, she just set the phone down and never said a word. I called back and a gentleman answered this time. I again asked to speak with the manager. He told me he was the evening shift manager. I explained the incident to him and he apologized and said that he was writing everything down to give to the Store Manager Miriam and she would be calling me back the following day. I never received a call from Miriam. It all boils down to customer service. 

These younger people today expect everything to be their way and if it isn't handled the way they think it should be then you the customer are in the wrong for thinking the customer is always right. 

My family and I really prefer Churches Chicken over KFC but with this kind of service we will not be back!!"}
{"text":"I usually like Church's but the chicken was dry and it just wasn't appetizing. I threw my meal away even though I was really hungry. This location is by far the most un satisfied place"}
{"text":"Usually come to this Churchs because of the distance from my house and the food is always fine, service is ok, and my order is always right. Unfortunately today they get 3 stars because I had to wait 20 min for my order.  I don't appreciate waiting so long for a 10 piece. Especially unpleasant since I had my 3 kids with me. I know these places get bust but 20 min seems a bit much to me."}
{"text":"The service is always top notch here. The food is just as great! I usually purchase the 5 piece for $5. The chicken, sides and biscuits are always fresh. My only complaint is that they charge .30 cents for sauces if you do not have strips. Not much of a complaint though."}
{"text":"Today I had the distinct pleasure of watching Emilia  pick her teeth at the counter while talking to another customer.. then she pulled her lip back and showed us all her teeth and gums! Ick! But wait, it gets better... I asked her if she was going to wash her hands.. and she said that she didn't have to she was just taking orders! I know! Makes you feel safe and happy... as I was leaving she came around the corner wiping her hands with a towel. I picked up my order from another employee and said that I was going to call the health department. To Emilia  I said thank you for washing your hands.. and she said she had a card and new what the rules.... well.... maybe not.  
I'm pretty sure as an employee picking your teeth in any restaurant and not what that establishment wants.  So I will file a report with the health department and try to notify the franchise owner. He may not care that customers had very contentious  encounters with his employees... I'm hoping he does."}
{"text":"Because their Chicken is good, one star. Just left the drive thru pissed. I'm by myself and they want to sell me this big ass meal. I said no thanks. I would like a 5 piece can strip meal. He said you can have a 9 piece with two fries for 4 dollars more. I told him he's confusing me. I started over. I want a 5 piece strip meal only... He tells me about 9 piece Again. STUPID! How many people eat 9 pieces and two orders of fries. I had to leave.... No wonder most of their restaurants are closing."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night right before 10pm and the doors were locked. They had friends hanging out at the drive thru socializing but when we walked up and asked why they were closed they all started speaking in Spanish then shook their heads and said 'Closed'. We asked if it was because they were out of food and they didn't respond. We walked all the way there for nothing. Will not return."}
{"text":"Slow, slow service.  I waited 40 minutes in the drive thru line just to be told, when I finally got to the speaker to order, they were out of what I wanted.  Maybe they were having a bad day but that is unacceptable."}
{"text":"WOW! The chicken I got from there was FANTASTIC! If you like crispy chicken, this is the place for you.  The biscuits we got were probably top 5 biscuits of all time.  They have honey on them. The location sucks but it is what it is.  I don't usually eat fried stuff because of my cholesterol but I would go back tomorrow if I could. Really good."}
{"text":"I ordered spicy and original tenders and when I got home there was only original. I called and spoke to the manager and she said she owns it that's why she's able to have bad service I would not recommend this place to anyone, buyer beware!!"}
{"text":"Churches has got to do better. I stopped by the churches on Nellis Blvd for what I thought would be a quick bite to eat, mind you there was no one else in the drive-thru. I only requested a 2 piece mixed & 2 hot peppers. The employee could not get that right. He repeated the order incorrectly at least 5 times. I get to the window and had to waited more than 6 minutes. I'm thinking they were cooking chicken and it would be hot and fresh. Wrong, the chicken was cold and stale. I gave it back and returned the chicken and requested a refund."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just get a hankerin' for tasty bizkits and this is where to come to scratch that itch!  Oh yeah,  they have pretty darn good crispy chicken too!"}

{"text":"I'm from Texas and I love fried chicken...I even have a peculiar affinity for Smith's fried chicken(just dry enough to accept lots of hot sauce.)

Soooo I go through drive through at 8PM and make a couple standard requests... okra?  fries? neither are available...and I finally ask what do you have.

Answer=nothing fried because we turned the fryers off because it's late in the day.
Obvious response=then how do you have fried chicken.
Answer=we made it earlier.
Obvious response=how much earlier.
Answer=after a long pause...10 minutes.
Obvious response=riiiiight...no thanks.

WoW!!!  This place just opened.  I expected so much more....like fried food.  Call me crazy."}
{"text":"25 years ago I tried Churches, and didn't like it then. Tried it Friday, yuk, same fatty-greasy-over cooked chicken . Other yelpers right, mac & cheese is play-dough like in nature.  Mashed potatoes & gravy in one container?? Your mom didn't serve it that way, so where'd you learn it? The only thing good was the corn on the cob! Tender juicy-excellent!  KFC May be out of your neighborhood & a little bit more $$, but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Didn't ask me if I want spicy or non-spicy when she took the order. After I remind her that I wanted all non-spicy, she was very very impatient. After I got home, I realized only one of them was non-spicy. So I had to drive back and ask for an exchange. And this time, there's literally the \"Fu\" word on her face. Still impatient and was trying to argue with me. I would give a 0 star if I could."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service And this is the 3rd time they get my order wrong. Will not be going there no more."}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before going to this location. I drive up and down rainbow 7 days a week and finally today I happen to be with the family and decided to give this location one more time as my wife had gone about 6 months ago. I told her and the kids that I would try this place one last time. The previous time there was too much grease inside.
So we ended up purchasing the $12.99 special (10 piece chicken and 2 sides) The Indian looking guy upgraded us to the biscuits which my kids say are great. 
I think there business is on the rocks because it seems that he penny pinches everywhere he can. Well, they saved a good 2 cents on putting the biscuits in the same box as the chicken. I'm sure you can guess what happened by the time we got home. Yes, they biscuits came out soggy. All for 2 cents? Then I opened the sides. The mashed potatoes were mixed with the gravy. I don't know if this is procedure but guess who didn't get any gravy?
Then I opened the Cajun rice. Not only did he save another 2 cents because it was half full. But the rice we did get was very, very soggy. My wife took a picture of this and said he was going to show it to the owner tomorrow. I told her to be careful because after reading these reviews, he might throw something at her or cuss her out.
Now I know after driving up and down on Rainbow Blvd. why they don't have any customers. Churchs chicken I'm sure is great, but not this location.
BTW I forgot to mention the owner saved another 2 cents by not giving us any napkins.
The moral of the story: don't forget to check your order before you leave and ask for your condiments and napkins!!
NEVER going back. 
BTW they have a now hiring sign out front.??? Beware future employees. Make sure to check your hours when you get your paycheck!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them negative stars!!!!! Horrible customer service! The manager is rude anytime we go to any other church's they allow us to get the pieces we want and just charge us extra for them he won't he'll give you a lot of problems. Today I went through the drive through haven't been to this location in about a year or more I ordered a chicken sandwich meal asked for a pack of mustard and they said no we don't have that then I asked if the sandwich had real chicken or artificial chicken and they lady answered no we don't have grilled chicken! So I just got frustrated and went ahead and ordered my chicken sandwich I figured thy sell real chicken there the sandwiches should be too. I pull up to the window I wait 5 minutes before they open the window to hand me my drink and take my debit card the lady doesn't say a word to me closes the window and I wait another 10-12 minutes no one checks on me or says anything at all then randomly some young kid opens the door with a bag all crumbled up and says is this your food I look at him and say uh yeah I'm guessing he doesn't say thank you or anything just looks at me like he's really confused and shuts the window I drove off to find a tiny dried up artificial chicken sandwich in my crumbled up bag extremely dry with shriveled up lettuce my okra is upside down in the bag my food wasn't even hot and the chicken taste like it was fried in old grease. I bit into God knows what in my chicken but after spending $10 on this crappy food I decided to eat the rest of my food. They need new management and workers here who understand their customers and what kind of food they're selling. I get chik fil a sandwiches they make my food fast the chicken is a real breaded chicken breast they'll add whatever sauce u ask for and they're service is amazing for the same price church's sells they're cheap disgusting food! Never again!"}
{"text":"I had a pregnant craving for fried chicken. My family owns a KFC so I absolutely did NOT want KFC. I went to Church's around twenty minutes ago and couldn't be happier. The girl who took my order was extremely friendly and that put a smile on my face before I even pulled up to the window. The boy working the window was just as pleasant! Very talkative and so polite. Not to mention, the food is fresh and tasty!!! This is going to be my new fried chicken stop for the next few months while having these cravings!!!"}
{"text":"The food is room temperature.  Worse the employees don't wash their hands after using the rest room."}
{"text":"This place would always be my go to place for Churches Chicken. Just today I ordered 15 pieces of chicken. Asked for some sauces and he actually gave me 9 hot sauce and 9 ketchup. Tried to ask for more but he said that's all he can do. But I saw a customer before me, I'm guessing he's a regular, because this employee gave him a handful of sauces. It's not like Churches Chicken will ever close so why are you guys being so cheap. Also asked for napkins but gave only 5 pieces. Told myself not going to this store ever again. Got home and was ready to eat, and found out they recooked some of the chickens cuz it was black due to the reapplied oil."}
{"text":"The food was nothing special.  I think I had better fried chicken at KFC.... the restaurant was pretty new and clean, but the service was slow and somewhat incompetent.  They made several mistakes with our simple order and requests.

Avoid the chicken tenders.  They have no flavour and they're not that crispy...

Go to Popeyes I say!  Better chicken and always fast service."}
{"text":"It was so bad experience!! i dont want to give 1 star if i could!  

I went there around 9:05 the main hall door was closed. So i checked open hour but it suppose to open til 10 but they closed their hall and operate only drive thru.. it was ok until that time

However i tried to order spicy chicken abd original chicken half and half but they said I cannot order spicy chicken . At first i thought maybe it came too late that spicy chicken was sold out but later i found out that i cannot order it because it took 20-30 minutes cook. I went there because of the Spicy chicken and i could wait about 1 hour to get it.

but they just told me absolute NO! 

This location staff was not friendly at all!!!! 

If you want to go Churches chicken then PLEASE go other place"}
{"text":"I moved closer to this location recently and decided to try it again.  First time was fine, ordered the 3 piece tender combo with fries and drink with no issues.  Second time I ordered the $4 box and was given bone in chicken instead of tenders, went in and got a pretty bad attitude because of their mistake.  

Skipping forward two months I went on Sunday and ordered the chicken tender special.  Got to the window, paid and received a curt order to pull forward and they'd bring me the food.  I did so and waited about 5 minutes (assume they were cooked to order) and my food came by someone else who was slightly nicer but still rude.  At home (within 10 minutes) I pulled the tenders out and the breading on two of the three tenders fell off, just slid right off.  The grease contained really can't be explained, I scraped the excess coating off all the tenders and when I went to eat that's when I discovered they were undercooked and crunchy.  So total waste of time and money, at least I could eat the biscuit."}
{"text":"As a fried chicken lover (popeyes / KFC ) this place makes possibly the best spicy chicken sandwich. Try the Mexicana sandwhich it is sooo friken good I'm eating it right now and the spices r spicy!!! 

You may have noticed another chicken place called quik chik - these guys r like a copy of popeyes. Churches Chicken is its own thing , it competes with KFC and POpeys because the flavour and style is different. 


The sandwhich is huge for the same price as popeyes but seems better quality. I did not mention that this has free pop refills ! Also the daily specials are done RIGHT. We r talking Mondays 4.99 any friken sandwhich . Perfect because popeyes sandwhich deal is on Wednesdays and so is the copy cat quik chik. 4.99 is cheaper than popeyes daily deal and is the right price . I am just so happy this place poped up near me because it's ganna get so popular . They even order on one of the apps (uber eats or just eats or skip the dishes - can't remember but they do it).

If you are a spicy chicken sandwhich lover - go her and order the mexicana. Your hunger will thank you and you will b back for more!

Fries look like they r McCain fries but actually taste decent . They have other unique sides like mashed potatoes and jalapeños popers. Just eating the poppers and they r like goood stuff good quality."}
{"text":"I put an order in advance over the phone with owner requesting that the chicken be well-done.

Instead chicken was under cooked and he refused to replace the chicken saying that next time he'll cook it well done, lmao.

Never going back... They'll let anybody open up a business in this country, or is Church's just desperate..."}
{"text":"Went to Church's last night because we were craving some fried chicken, anywayd we got there around 8:40 pm and decided to go inside to order. When we go to the door one of the employees had told us \"could you go through thebdrive thru please? We're just about to close.\" 

In my head I was like what the hell?! The sign on the door says they're open until 10:00 pm. We're nowhere near that time. Well okay so we decided to go to the drive thru. We ordered a 15 piece meal and the lady behind thr intercom tells me, \"I'm sorry ma'am I only have about 2 pieces of chicke. Left since we're about to close.\" 

At this point I was pissed, you guys don't close until 10 PM like it says on the door! If you've changed the closing time why not update it? I left upset and disappointes because we really wanted chicken!"}
{"text":"We eat at Churches a few times a month. The chicken strips are wonderful! The fries are hot and crispy. The staff is friendly even though they are always busy. There's no long wait for food, but they will tell you if something's being made for your order. I use the app for coupons and rewards.
Its a very good experience for us every time. We'll be back to this Churches."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this location, the chicken was dry and kind of hard, like it had been sitting around awhile.  I gave the place the benefit of the doubt and came back a few months later, during the weekend.  Same thing.  I noticed both times the place was empty, so I'm pretty sure the food just sits there until they need to replenish.  I understand they just can't throw out the chicken after a certain amount of time, but seriously...it was not a pleasant experience. I usually go to the one on 35th & Cactus cuz it's on my way home from work--always had fresh chicken there, though the area is so ghetto. 

My bad for giving this place a second chance.  I won't be surprised when they go out of business."}
{"text":"Would give a 0 star rating if possible! This place won't last once KFC opens right down the street. I have gone here maybe 4 times an every single time my order has been incorrect or missing something!! Don't waste your time stopping here!"}
{"text":"It is what it is people. Crap food. I spent $1.99 on a 2pc Tuesday special. Comes with mash and a bisquit. Everything is mediocre but then again I didn't come here for the outstanding quality of food. The guy at the counter hates me cause I asked for ketchup and a fork and I payed for my food with change. I hate him too. All in all cheap and crappy!"}
{"text":"Totally avoid this horrible place. It only runs efficiently when the owner is there, and he's rarely there at night. Totally incompetent staff that were rude, gave us the wrong order and over charged us. I swear that all the lot of them in there were high out of their minds. Drug addicts working with food? No thanks! Plus, it seemed to taste a lot like dish soap. So unsatisfied and rather pissed about it. Forget you, Church's on South Rainbow! Only going to the one on Spring Mountain from now on."}
{"text":"I went against my better judgement and did something I said I'd never do again...I stopped at Church's chicken for dinner. Huge mistake. So the chicken wasn't THAT bad, but the sides made me want to slap them with a lawsuit for cruel and unusual punishment. I got mashed potatoes and some yellow goop they called macaroni and cheese. There's only been 2 times in my life where I couldn't eat some Mac and Cheese...the first time was in 2008 when I had Mexican Macaroni and Cheese from an MRE (I still have nightmares) and this garbage they served me was the second time. They ought to be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"I had to give one star because it wouldnt accept a zero.
Went through the drive through and ordered their special. Person i bought it for said the chicken wasnt cooked. Called Churches and spoke to the manager. SHE SAID SHE COULDNT DO ANYTHING FOR ME WITHOUT THE RECEIPT. It was in the package with the inedible chicken. I was wondering why it took so long so he served chicken that wasnt done. Unacceptable! !! You think im trying to get free chicken? No more of my business anymore. 
I spent a lot of money here in the past but im sure there are other establishments that will take my money and offer better service. 
Churches, check your manager at the West Charleston store. 
I hate Churches now."}
{"text":"This place is trash. I've given it three tries with the time wait and it really doesn't make a difference they are just terrible. First, you drive up to the window to order, there's literally nobody in front of you but they immediately ask you to wait several minutes before taking your order. Then, they will take FOREVER TO fill the order even if there's no one in front of you and hopefully they even get your order right. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Food is good but always seem to be out of the spicy chicken :( . Really long waits . Start as 15 min to 20 min. Customer satisfaction is very poor. Took an extremely long time . I am not coming here again . I do not recommend this location ."}
{"text":"Staff was slow. The guy at the counter didn't understand the concept of a coupon and charged us regular price. We didn't bother with arguing over it because there was a line building behind us. The location isn't the best location. A lot of people that came in wanted to use the restroom but knew the rule of having to purchase something in order to use the facilities. Next time I crave chicken I'd go to a different location."}
{"text":"The most revolting fast food experience I've had... Ever!

My wife and I do fried chicken maybe once a month and she asked me to try churchs. 

This happened on 02/25/10

This location is small. You can see everything happening in the kitchen. I arrived about 8:30 and went to order.
The kid working the register was sweating quite a lot. He also had bad larynghitis (could hardly talk) which happens when you are sick and your throat swells and presses on your vocal chords, it happens to me every winter.

So I order. He has problems hearing me and I am not a quiet person. He can't hear me. Guess his head cold has his ears congested. 

After that I watch him go back into the kitchen (you can see everything) and right next to the chicken... AHH-CHOO! and he sneezes into his HAND and then wipes his NOSE in his shirt...!

I called the manager over and demanded my money back right away.
She asked in Spanish to herself \"oh, porque?\" (\"oh, why?\") and I answered \"porque? Because your employee is sick and just sneezed and wiped his nose on his shirt! It's disgusting is why!\"

she answered with \"well he's no touching the food...\" 

I swear to God this really happened.
Absolutely horrifying.
I am calling the head office of this company this week and maybe even the Clark county health department."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken, sides including corn. Look at this pic! Definitely NOT just smashed. That's a perfect circle... A BITE MARK! We ordered through the drive-thru.. Went home and found this. The manager wanted me to drive all the way back to get the $1.79 or whatever the less than $2 for this corn was - which you know in Vegas, nothing is just 2 minutes away! He didn't offer anything but that! Says you don't have to come back right now but whenever you can so I can give you the $1 something. Wtf?! I said why would I drive back just for that? And he says well that's all he can do. He can't return the payment to the card we used.. He can't refund everything. Doesn't offer something to cover how they grossed us out and inconvenienced us! How about not giving me nasty used food! And refund my whole purchase! Ridiculous! Doesn't care about the customer! Isn't even embarrassed they served that! No integrity! I even wrote to corporate and NO REPLY! This company doesnt't care about anything but selling their salty-ass chicken and chewed up corn!"}
{"text":"Chicken is super good. Moist, big pieces. Love the biscuits,and mashed potatoes. 

Very friendly and quick service. Always go through the drive thru but I always get freshly made, and hot chicken in about 1-3 mins tops.  Only location we go to, and much better than the one on Charleston near Walmart, where you almost always get greasy chicken and not so friendly service (for a pretty baron location,) 

This one on Spring Mountain Road is almost always busy after 5 PM, , this place has GREAT food and service for a fastfood joint. 

Food is consistent and tasty."}
{"text":"Oops! This Church's Chicken Restaurant has been closed for over a year!"}
{"text":"I had the worst drive through service that I have ever received. I was not greeted by an employee, the employees looked super upset and did not smile, my order came out wrong, I was not given any napkins, the gravy inside the bag was open and spilled everywhere, and the service was super slow! I am never coming back to this location and do not recommend it!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why there are bad reviews about this location.  I had a pleasant experience.  Used the drive thru. The employee who was clearly a little overwhelmed, and alone trying to train a new employee, was extremely nice, and apologetic.  The food was good, and the order was correct.  I will come back to this location."}
{"text":"This place was good, I mean I knew it was gonna be greasy fried chicken, but it was juicy! Coleslaw was good and mashed potatoes and gravy was like KFC. Biscuits had a honey glaze on the top, they were good. Overall, its fast food, customer service made me give them 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Ordered from UberEATS & really enjoyed it. The mashed potatoes are pretty generic but the sandwich was delicious and HUGE! You could tell the ingredients are fresh & the chicken was big and moist. Will definitely order again!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this Church's for many years now and have never had any issues with the service or the food.  They are always courteous and prompt when I place my order, especially since my orders are always large orders.  Their prices are on par with most fast food restaurants and unlike KFC, their chicken doesn't upset my stomach.  A little tip for ordering here, if you plan on placing a large order ($30+) call ahead and make them aware so they can have it ready when you arive."}
{"text":"After visiting this location on two occasions and having horrible experiences both times, I feel compelled to write a review. Service at this location is the absolute worst. I spoke with the manager on my first visit, and he blamed me for sitting in the drive-through for 20 minutes. After waiting 20 minutes I got the wrong food. On my second visit, tonight, I pulled up to the drive-thru and no one took my order. I drove up to the window after waiting for 10 minutes and the emoyee never acknowledged my presence to take my order, so I left without getting service. If you want chicken, go to the Church's in the Shell Station at Bethany Home and the I-17. Their employees are helpful, they get your order right and don't make you wait endlessly for service and food."}
{"text":"I ordered Spicy and when I got home it was plain. How hard can it be to get an order right?"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. I have been in line for 45 mins. And there's only 3 cars ahead of me. Terrible terrible location. Just save your gas and money and cook at home. Not even worth it. Not only to mention, there all rude kids working here."}
{"text":"Been raining for 4 days straight so I didn't feel like cooking dinner after work.  Swung through the drive through to get a combo with an extra side and two extra biscuits.  Got home only to find that while I got my extra side, I did not get the two extra biscuits.  Granted, it was only a dollar for the biscuits, but still  considering that I was the only one in the drive through at the time and it didn't look like there was anyone ordering inside, it would have been nice to have gotten my complete order."}
{"text":"As a San Antonio native, I grew up on Church's chicken and am still a reluctant fan although it hasn't been the same since it was bought out in 1989, first merged with Popeye Chicken, and began operations out of New Orleans.  Subsequent  corporate buyouts were by AFC Enterprises Inc. ( Atlanta),  Arcapita, Inc (also Atlanta). and it now appears to be operated, at least internationally, as \"Texas Chicken\" out of New Jersey....of all places.... wasn't that a Pace's salsa TV ad?... \"New Yawk City!!! 

I stayed loyal after they dropped the pineapple fried pies from their  menu back in the 90's.  Recently they stopped providing honey packets; damyankees don't know about fried chicken.  It used to be cheap too but is now  \"competitively priced\".   It still has good fried chicken and is the only fast-food place I know of in greater Phoenix for fried okra.

It beats hell out of KFC, even their \"normal\" fried chicken.  Honestly, though, I now mostly go to El Pollo Loco although their chicken is grilled.  If there was a Pollo Campero on the East Side, I'd be there before Church's now.  I'd rather give my business to a Guatemala group than a New Jersey conglomerate that flies under the \"Texas Chicken\" false flag.  Pollo Campero's chicken is about the same and cheaper.  

Oh, and avoid the corn-on-the-cob at Church's ...it is soft and soggy.   Be sure to ask for honey and pineapple fried pies, I always do, maybe they'll get the message."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and the chicken is always nice and juicy! I've always liked the leg but now I'm a thigh girl. The spicy chicken actually has a very nice kick which I like a lot and I even dip it in more hot sauce! I'm curious to try the hot wings next time."}
{"text":"Staff was nice and food appeared to be fresh and hot. My complaint # 1 is that using the frying oil to do chicken and fish leaves the chicken tasting fishy. Was not happy. # 2 is that mashed potatoes are served with gravy already on them. I don't do gravy. Even more unhappy. So much for trying Church's chicken the 1st time. Definitely the last. KFC is # 1 for a reason....now I know why."}
{"text":"Honestly I was expecting worse.
Its basically a KFC knock off. But I liked the food I got a lot better than KFC. I had a chicken sandwich and fries. The fries were awesome. Perfect crunch factor to them. The chicken wasn't as good as I thought it would be. But it wasn't bad either. 
It was very quiet in there and the girl who was at the counter  was very nice. 
I also liked the more modern look they were going for with the furniture inside. It was pretty clean. Which for a fast food restaurant is usually not common.
I'd go back again for sure."}
{"text":"This place has the worst customer service! They don't mess up the food because there is already a menu!!! I went throught the drive thru. The line was long since I got there, when it was finally time to place my order Im asked to wait a minute. At first I thinks they are just trying to catch up. Then 5 minutes pass and no one has checked up on me. I had to remind them I was still there, I placed my order and when I get to the window, there are no cars in front of me!!! I pay my food and I not told until Im finished paying that I still have to wait on more chicken! I spent about 30 minutes on a drive thru,  if not more! Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"I went here on my lunch break. I was the only person in the drive -thru (now, I see why). I was not satisfied with the drive- thru service. I  tried to give my order , she stop me and \" Just a minute.\"  On that day, it was not crowded. When she was ready to take my order, gave her the order,then there was a five minute pause. Finally, the drive -thru lady said \" Can you repeat that.\" Sure. fine. Maybe I said it too fast. I repeat.  Another long pause.  She did not understand it. I got out of the car and talked directly in the intercom. Finally,  She understood it ,then she asked what kind of drink. I said SPRITE.  I finished my order and pull forward.  Another long wait.  Then she finally gives me my food. I check my food, the order is wrong,and she gave me a Pepsi.  I did not find anything good to say about this place. Definitely, I am not recommending this place. Horrible customer service. 20 minute wait for food. Absolutely not."}
{"text":"Not as good as Popeye's or KFC but it's fried chicken. How bad can fried chicken be? It is impossible, it is fried! LOL. You can either get spicy or regular, I like the spicy. They have the usual sides' corn on the cob, mashed, fries and deep fried okra! Their biscuits are a little too hard but not bad. They usually have great deals and specials for dark meat mixed chicken. I love going to church's on Sundays and pray that I do not get a heart attack soon."}
{"text":"service was ok. but you know you can always expect amazing fried chicken when you go to church's. I will always go here for my fried chicken cravings!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for fried chicken .They are so juicy and fill of tasty flavor.Even other store under the same brand cannot compare this location's. This's store is the best."}
{"text":"I too had a run in with the manager because he got my order wrong.  I ordered all white meat and when I got home I had all legs and thighs and one of my sides were missing.  I had ordered 2 20 piece meals.  When I returned the owner told me that I did not get the chicken in the churchs chicken box from them. I advised him to look at my receipt it has the time and was less than 5 minutes ago and it would take me a lot longer to fry 40 pieces of chicken.  The guy went bonkers and began to yell and said I will give you your money back and asked for my card.  When I gave him my card he returned it by thtowing it into the dinning room. I told him he had five seconds to pick it up or he was going to follow it.  He picked my card up handed it to me and told me to go F&*k myself.  I too advised that I would be calling corporate and was told he owned the f*&@ing place and to kiss his A@$. He also said he made millions and  was going to leave this country so he didn't have to deal with F&^%ing black people like me.  I have never in my whole life been so disrespected.  I will never eat here again.  The owner is the guy wearing the turban."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas so when I saw a Church's Chicken was opening, I had to go!  I wasn't disappointed either!  It was just as I remembered it. 

The chicken is far better than KFC has ever been and the staff were amazing! But the best part is the biscuits, with the honey butter. I even got a dozen to go."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst customer service I have ever seen it any fast food location. Apparently has never heard of the word please or thank you. When told so order was abruptly stopped with \"just a minute\". Once I finished ordering was told to \"pull forward\" very rudely. Maybe she was having a bad day but that's still no way to talk to customers. Will not be visiting this establishment again!

Part 2: after getting home and opening up the box of chicken, was once again disappointed. The chicken was soggy and dripping oil. If no stars was an option, they would have zero!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I made a yelp account as I wait for my food at this place. I put my order for spicy and they gave me original because they \"ran out\" of spicy. She said it would be 11 minutes wait for it. Which I am. And I am looking at the rest of my order sit there on the counter. I told her I wanted everything warm and she simply put it back with the rest of the other chicken. Wow. We shall see how it comes out. Damn my craving for fried chicken."}
{"text":"I am only putting one star because I can not put zero.  This place is a mess and I can't review the food because we never even got to try it.  After being ignored for nearly five minutes as the \"crew\" fooled around in the back of the restaurant, two people walked up and completely ignored us.  They would not even make eye contact with us.  After a few more minutes of waiting for someone to acknowledge us, we walked out.

Fabulous customer service Church's!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Church's Chicken for decades and lost my mind when they came out with the Spicy Chicken recipe. This review isn't about the quality of the chicken, but the quality of the service at this particular store. It seems that every time I come here, there is never any Spicy Chicken cooked and I usually get told that it will be a half hour before any will be ready. The staff is indifferent about customer needs, they mess up orders often and seem to get attitudes when you have large or special requests (like an all white piece meal). The dining room and bathrooms are always dirty, therefore I can only imagine what the employees hygiene is like. I love Church's Chicken, but I would never recommend this store."}
{"text":"Really slow on drive thru my husband and i sat in our car for maybe over 15min. and the past two times I've been there they had no ranch or honey. 
A real horrible experience, never again will I go there."}
{"text":"I went to this location and they were very rude , I was in drive thru and I asked if they had potato wedges and the rude girl from drive thru said \" no this isn't Popeyes's \" like okay I didn't ask you if it was Popeyes's and I especially didn't ask you for your attitude. Then she went on and called me a \"Bitch\" she probably didn't realize she was on the speaker. If the manager allows these type of people to work for her maybe her priorities aren't high enough"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this location. The chicken was almost burnt. It was very dark with that old oil taste. They should never have served it like that. We bought the 18 piece meal. The coleslaw was cold but the Mac was not even warm. It was like room temperature."}
{"text":"Decent chicken sandwiches, fries were okay. Fed two people for under $13 so that's almost a miracle! Not sure I'd say it's the best I've ever had but it's far better than Popeyes."}
{"text":"Sigh. I've always loved Churches Chicken. For the longest I've always said they beat Popeyes or KFC, but this location, I'm always having a problem. I was so excited when I found out there's a Churches opening on my side a year or so ago, but yesterday I had enough.

I ordered a family meal and saw the new jalapeño cheddar biscuit bites, so I wanted to try the 5 piece. I ordered, and when I got to the window, the lady was pretty rude. Snatched my card out of my hand and just swiped it. I had seen her on the window getting my food together and saw that everything was done, but tell me why I had to wait a long time still. They just moved at a very slow pace. When a man came to the window to give me my food, I politely asked \"could I have hot sauce and honey please?\" He looked at me like I was retarded and didn't say a word. I then said, \"well is it in the bag?\" He gave me an annoyed/sarcastic \"yeah!\" So I just said, \"okay thanks, all you had to do is say so.\" I took my food and left. I then wanted to try the biscuit bites and first one I had was burnt and it tasted old. So I went for the next one and I kept chewing on God knows what. I pulled it out of my mouth and placed it in my cup holder. This was night time so I couldn't see what it was when I was driving home. This morning, I saw it in my cup holder and to my surprise it was wood shavings. That's so nasty.

Every other time I've been here it's always dealing with rude employees and very slow service. Guess it's Popeyes from now on, at least it's just a little further up the road."}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten here before and wanted to try it. We walked in like tourists not knowing what was good to order but Larry was great on helping us decide and gave great customer service. We will definitely eat here again because of the good food and great service. Kudos to Larry!"}
{"text":"One of the better churches I've been to.. they are fast .. professional. . Very courteous. . I'm from the east valley and am used to the opposite. .. very clean and organized. ."}
{"text":"Too much to list, management needs help. We weren't offered coupons but the people after us were. They were too busy talking versus trying to help the customers."}
{"text":"church's chicken always is my favorite place to eat fry chicken, I always go to the one by my home, but today I went one on charleston, I ordered special meal with seven pieces chicken , four biscuits and large mash potato when I went back home, just found out they didn't put my mash potato , I was so mad, never want go to that one no more"}
{"text":"If there is any way to give this restaurant a zero I would. I ordered at 11:08 received my food at 11:30 after the three people ordered after me got their food. This place is ridiculous. They were all standing in back and I actually had to yell at them to get their attention. You wonder why places like this people come in and beat the s*** out of the people behind the counter."}
{"text":"I've been to many Church's Chickens and I like this one the best because I always get fresh chicken. Besides that, the manger is super friendly and I always get extra strips :) or an upgrade for free!"}
{"text":"I come here because I'm a fan of this chain and because it's the nearest Church's near my house.  The place is fairly clean as it's fairly new.
   Last time I came though they were advertising a family meal with 2 large sides for $10.99 right upfront streetside of the establishment and unbeknownst to me charged my card $11.99 a day before they changed the price the following day.  Strike one.  Then I go to order and tell the guy I want all spicy, he tells me he only has half my order for the spicy I was like don't worry I'll wait, I want all spicy.  Waited a good 8-10 minutes he tells me okay you're good to go.  Surprise I get home and half is regular.  Like W-T-F you make me wait and still give me what you wanted.  Strike two.  I'll update qt a later day in cqse I go back, their sweet tea tends to draw me in.  Hope I'm not in for strike three."}
{"text":"Stick with Popeye's. 

I ordered fried okras and the quality was not that great. I thought I was chewing on gum. The chicken had tons of fatty parts."}
{"text":"Weak. This location is not good. My wife and I was craving chicken. I decided church's. I went here and drove through drive Thru. Ordering was the worst. The screen was flickering as I was ordering and i couldn't even see what I ordered. The price was jumping all over the place. From $20 to $2,000. Lol here I what I ordered,

10 piece chicken only
5 spicy and 5 regular

4 corn on the cob

First they ran out of legs and thighs so they have breast( I hate breast). I don't get how you can run out of chicken. They didn't even ask if I wanted to wait for it to be done. Nope they just put whatever they wanted. I was in drive thru for 19 mins till I got my food. Chicken was ok and I would not come here again. Nope nope nope!!! I rather go to KFC or Popeyes."}
{"text":"the chicken was awesome, hot, and really fresh.  however i ordered the jalapeno cheese poppers and let me tell you they were a very big disappointment.  the flavor was there however the cheese was very hollow and not what i am used to."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say in previous reviews, I came here three times already and its hands down best Church's in Vegas, the rest are whack.  Although I came at closing time one day , they let me chill there as long as I wanted without rushing me. The whole staff is cool people.  Keep up the good work , I know you really don't care about your work that much but just know that good food after a stressful day is something meaningful to the people you serve."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING. I think that's all I really need to say. They're lucky we can't prove it since after researching a possible lawsuit, I found that you need to bring leftovers to a lab for testing. Unfortunately, we threw the leftovers away. My entire household threw up about 20 times each. I'm not a fan of hospitals but we had no choice but to go. Dehydration level was dangerous, and our stomachs wouldn't hold a drink of water for more than 30 seconds. I should also rate sunrise hospital on here too. They we very nice and professional, but it took 2 hours of waiting and throwing up in the emergency room before we received an iv and pain meds. We were asked our symptoms and pain level by 5 different nurses/doctors assistants. Repetitive much?? But having to wait that long in a room full of people, while throw up every 5-10 minutes was tough. Every time I looked up EVERYONE was looking at me with an expression that said \"I'm glad I'm not that guy\"."}
{"text":"I went into Church's today experience better than 09/28/2016 The staff was better professional smiling and saying welcome to church's, my food was Hot and correct one Breast and one Wing fresh and Hot MILD. I want to thank MISS SUZANNE and STAFF I watch the cashier the whole time waiting on my food they didn't make not one mistake. Thanks for improving the staff and teaching them the different between white meat and dark meat."}
{"text":"So I was forced to come all the way to this location on a Sunday afternoon because the one on Nellis didn't have any spicy chicken. Well as I entered the door there was no kind of greeting or acknowledgement from anyone. So when I did order she aurally p actually was pleasant and nice. She made sure I had fresh hot fries and they had  spicy chicken here. Fries were good and chicken was fresh and spicy n like I wanted n it. 

Guess I will have to drive across town to this one if I want spicy chicken. But they need to work on their customer service skills. Asking $15 per hour you need to stepn it b up  fast food workers."}
{"text":"So I'm here again and they still don't have any spicy chicken. Why ask me what I want if you don't ever have it? The most ridiculous thing ever and people are getting off work such horrible drive. I will never waste my time here again!  This was a last minute thing for me and wanted some spicy chicken."}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about this place and having a whole discussion with some people on the interiorwebs I decided I finally had to try this place out. It is supposed to be like the best fast food chicken ever according to some...or maybe even the best chicken ever I'm not sure.
The existence of this location came as a surprise to many as if you look on the Church's Chicken site it has a locator and it lists 19 locations in Canada all in BC but none in ON.
I decided to go with the Tex Supreme combo after talking - briefly - with the lady behind the counter. I ended the conversation with that lady as quickly as possible because she was not very nice...she acted as if I should know all about the different menu choices and was surprised that I was even asking questions. First off lady, you're franchise is the only location in Canada east of the Rocky Mountains so being a first timer shouldn't be such a surprise and second, you guys don't list your sandwiches' ingredients on the giant billboard on top of your head so how am I supposed to know what's in the sandwiches?
Why did I give it a 2 star \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" rating? Here's a roundup:
- Chicken was pretty damn good.
- Jalapeño Cheese Bombers were delicious.
- Mashed potatoes in gravy were meh at best.
- Surly staff.
- Owner? Manager? doesn't know how to behave to customers.
- Overpriced. My meal + the 4 Jalapeno Cheese Bombers worked out to $11.05 after taxes.

First, the sandwich:  I ordered it spicy and it did have a decent spice to it, not an overpowering spice but a tasty one so good job on that Church's Chicken. It looked quite pale, wasn't golden, had barely any crispy-crunchiness to it but all in all still tasted good. I don't know if I would rate it best chicken ever but it was definitely quite good.
Second, the mashed potatoes and gravy: Meh. I do not recommend trying this if you ever go there. Maybe the fries are the better choice because the gravy was so watery and tasted so processed and out of a box that it just ruined the mashed potatoes for me.
Third, the Jalapeño Cheese Bombers: In a word - Delicious. They could have been bigger and should have been as they cost slightly under $0.75+tax each but I really liked them. Did they taste better than any sports bar's Jalapeño Poppers that I have had in the past? Nope. I am just a fan of deep fried cheese stuffed jalapeños in general so this is probably why I quite enjoyed these. For the price though, they weren't worth it but seeing as I made the trek out there they were the saving grace of the entire experience.

{"text":"I haven't ordered chicken from this location in a while and now I remember why!  First of all, I asked for a spicy chicken strip meal (had to repeat the word \"spicy\" about 5 times because the guy couldn't understand) with a side of bombers and sweet tea.  Then I had to wait in line over 25 minutes.  25 FUCKIN MINUTES!  There were only 2 cars ahead of me.  I get to the window, pay for the order, and wait another 5 minutes.  When I got home, I noticed that my drink was cola, not the tea I ordered.  The bombers were good as usual, but one of my strips felt like a rubber doorstop.  It was UNDERCOOKED and none of them were spicy.  This is absolute crap.  The place is closed so I'm Yelping the hell outta them in hopes that they'll get it together and serve quality food again.  Fire the whole staff and start over if you have to!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've visited this churches and I've been disappointed again. Customer service was poor, food mediocre and overall experience was horrible. What topped off my whole experience was the fact that the drive thru guy (Chelino, he was also the same guy as my first experience) did not want to give me more then 2 ranch for my large order of jalapeño  cheese bombers, 2 chicken tenders and 5 chicken sandwiches! So dumb to want that extra 30 cents a ranch packet then to send me on my way a sort of happy customer. I will not be returning to this location and I would advise all of you reading this to spend your money somewhere it will be more appreciated."}
{"text":"This location is extremely, extremely, extremely slow and the customer service is terrible! Every time my husband and I come here, the workers working the drive thru take 10 minutes to take our order and then once we drive to the window they take 5 minutes to greet us and give us our total then another 5 minutes to give us our food, which the order is always wrong, they forgot to give us our biscuits that came with one of the family meals we ordered, thigh and legs when we order the lemon pepper chicken wings and the hot sauce packets we received were empty. This location won't remain open long if they keep this up!"}
{"text":"Waiting over 5 minutes in a drive thru line for non quality fast food doesn't sit well with me. Especially when the drive thru is right next to a couple giant dumpsters and there is no one in line.

I stopped here since my BF wanted a quick bite to eat while we were on a time crunch. Definitely didn't come to be impressed, yet they still managed to hit below the bar of what I was expecting.

I got the okra bites. It was more fried batter than okra. I ended up eating just a couple bites."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location it's always busy which is a good sign to me. Usually places are busy for a reason and I think because of how good and cheap their chicken is. I like how the chicken is served to you hot, crispy and juicy. Usually every time I stop by Mill mall I visit Church's chicken to get a meal or a quick snack."}
{"text":"Staff was okay. Facility was terrible. Dust all over the shelves near food prep. There was also some very questionable characters out front who made it not a great exit or entry. Work being done on the bathrooms so they were not available to wash hands before eating....Food was just okay. Not sure I would ever go back to this location."}
{"text":"After watching a TV show, decided I wanted some Chicken.  I'm so lucky that this location is open until 10:30... except when I arrived at 10:15 they told me they are closed... but the OPEN sign was still lit up.  Just lazy... lazy lazy lazy.  If they are closed then why would anyone be around on the drive thru speaker to tell us they are closed?  Childish childish childish.  If you're open until 10:30 then be open until 10:30.  Is that too much to ask?"}
{"text":"Worst chicken ever! I ordered a chicken meal in the drive through for my dad in a nursing home. He usually likes Church's so I wanted to bring him some thing special today. It's Memorial Day and he is part of the men who served his country. He was very happy when I walked in with a familiar bag. I ordered the meal he usually gets. The 2 piece bone in with mashed potatoes and an extra side of corn on the cob. I asked for a leg and breast....I got a leg and wing. Really Church's?? No biscuit but when I asked for honey the smug kid in the drive through gave me 4. For what I'm not sure. The chicken was so dry I would swear it was from the night before. Also the corn was so dry and old he could not even eat it. He ate the mashed potatoes which were fine and honestly hard to ruin. If the manager or owner reads this it was ticket # 0391 May 29 at 11:27 pm but I doubt he or she does because of all the previous bad reviews. Church's used to be his favorite but I will never bring him that mess again. Sad Church's....really really sad."}
{"text":"So fuckin gross! I went to this Church's for lunch.
I was eating when I saw 3 roaches on the floor. I went to the restroom to throw up and there was a shit ton of roaches in the restroom. Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"The service is very slow I went last night and waited in line for a whole hour when there was only two cars ahead of me. On top of that they took order quickly but didn't have meal ready until I was at the window. I probably won't be going here again the food was however good and hot since they had decided to put it in once I got to the window."}
{"text":"So gross. Everything about it. The food was terrible and burnt. Im going to vomit right now thinking about it. I just got finished eating two bites and i threw the whole thing away. The building itself is disgusting and filthy. The windows are covered in a nasty film. This place needs to be torn down immediately. There is absolutely no way this place could pass any sort of sanitary regulations. I have never been to a place that serves food that is as gross as this place."}
{"text":"Church's chicken is my favorite place to go when I am craving chicken this particular location is good the service is great and the customer service is always top notch in my honest opinion church's chicken is way better then KFC and on top of that you get a better deal with Churchs then you do with KFC and there mash potatoes are way better then KFC along with the biscuits love it I plan on going back to Churchs again when I start craving chicken again lol."}
{"text":"If you go during the day its not to bad since the owners are there but at night it all falls apart they are always out of something its jus plain horrible"}
{"text":"Ordered their fried chicken meal here for my boyfriend and I because he was craving chicken. After we ate a couple of hours later we started feeling sick like null and wanting to run to the bathroom. This was going on for two days! And I still feel sick! This happened on 11/22/2017 ordered around 8pm. And this was the only thing we had this very day because we've been so busy and jst didn't have time to eat  till it was dinner time. After this whole ordeal I will never return to church's!! Seriously health inspection need to hit this location up!!"}
{"text":"Went there on 8/13/12  Was the worst chicken we ever ate. After our first couple of bites my wife and i looked at each other and both said this chicken doesn't taste right. In fact it tastes like it was spoiled, we just threw the rest away. Was not planning on going back anyway, the service was just as bad as the chicken and its very expensive for what you get considering on those 3 blocks of rainbow there is cane's, Popeye's, albertsons, el pollo loco, and the worst church's. Now I know why its called Church's because you have to pray you don't get sick."}
{"text":"I gave this location 3 chances room for improvement, but to no avail it didn't happen. Twice i got my chickens still red to pinkish meat inside and the taste is not the same as the decatur & S.Mnt. even though the manager/owner says it's the same. Seems like there's an extra taste of curry or weird exotic spices."}
{"text":"I have tried so hard to like this place because it's inexpensive and most of the time when I actually can ORDER my food I enjoy it. But the other day was the final straw. More times than I can remember I've tried to go through the drive-thru only to have to back out and drive away due to a rediculously long wait time. I've gone there with no one in line and waited forever and nobody ever comes on to take my order. The other day I wanted just a chicken sandwhich and a dr. pepper. There was one lady in front of me, and that was all. I didnt see more than one car in the parking lot and a couple people walking out of the place so it was not busy. After about 5 minutes I see the lady in front of me waving her arms...she says she hasn't been waited on. I'm like...this is pathetic. I backed out, drove down to McDonalds and I vowed to never go back to that place again. I can understand if a place is busy you have to wait. But this has happened so many times. I'm not even going to get into the rude customer service I've recieved over the years. They really need some help when it's clear no one likes working there. Next time I'll just go to Popeye's or KFC down the street. Both places are very customer service oriented and the food tastes fresh and yummy."}
{"text":"I saw this Church's Fried Chicken place while filling up with gas at 32nd street.  I couldn't help but try them as I was a Church's Fried Chicken virgin.  My mother used to eat it ALL THE TIME in upper Manhattan in New York City where she ran a store.  I guess it was a quick, cheap lunch, but it had to be more than that as my mother was a good cook who knew how to make good chicken herself.  I walked in for the $2.99 order which seemed cool (two pieces of chicken, one side and one biscuit), but after all was said and done I upgraded to an additional side and an additional biscuit--still a good value for the money.  
Got home with my chicken in tow, thinking of mom all the way since I was carrying her favorite meal. Wondering if I would like it.  
My two pieces of chicken were ample, crispy and not as greasy as I expected.  I have had chicken that begins with a \"K\"  and found it to be greasy around these parts so I was pleasantly surprised with how un-greasy it was.  The biscuits were soft like biscuits should be (not hockey-pucks).  However, they put some type of sweet glaze on it that I would have omitted.  I like my biscuits like biscuits--they are not dessert --they are supposed to complement the chicken.  I would have left that glaze off.  Would I eat them again.  Yup.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good.  Glad I upgraded to an extra side so now I have one in the fridge waiting for me to dig into it.   So there you have it.  Good chicken, good mashed potatoes and a pretty good biscuit.  Yelpers are complaining about the mac and cheese here.  SO DON'T GET IT. Few places make real good mac and cheese.  And some restaurants feel that they have to add four cheeses to the Mac and Cheese to make it good.  NO, NO, NO, NO.  Use sharp cheddar and make a béchamel sauce, etc etc.  (can't give you my whole recipe or you will make mac and cheese as well as I do.  NO CAN DO. I want to remain the Queen of Mac & Cheese in my family!!)   Now you know the real deal---it's the mashed potatoes you should go for when you go to a Church's Chicken.  So despite the complaints by some Yelpers, the \"Boss Lady\" came, bought and ate Church's Chicken and liked it.  There you have it."}
{"text":"Two Words: MyKinda Church

People always assume that I only like fine dining. But nah man I love Fried Chicken. Best (fast food) fried chicken in Vegas. I've been here at least ten times. Moist, succulent, and crispy. 

Homeboy behind the register was hilarious

Other Church's do not compare. Trust me on that!"}
{"text":"I usually go to church's chicken when I want some fried chicken but this location is awful! The customer service is the worst. When i pull through the intercom. The employee working the drive thru mumbled something i could hardly hear him. So I started to tell him my order and he yelled \" You obviously didn't hear me! Ill be right with you!\" I just wanted to drive off but i was already on a time crunch for work. So i let it slide. When i pulled to the window the guy didnt even have my order right. It took them a while to complete my order. They didnt even give me any sauce or asked me if i wanted any sauce. I ordered a #3 the chicken had this weird sticky residue on it. It looked like someone spit on my chicken. I didnt even bother eating it. Id rather starve than eat that garbage!Never again will i go back to this location. Awful service and disgusting!"}
{"text":"They  got  my  order  wrong  and when I  went  back to  get a new order it was wrong.  The manager  was rude."}
{"text":"I work nearby on my break i went and got chicken strip meal.  Got back to work and it was jalapeno poppers.  Called for 20 minutes they have no answering machine p.s than i finally got someone,  was put on hold.  Was then told mame were busy,  whats going on.  I explained i understood it's busy but i want to come back for my meal.  They then literally asked me how nanny poppers were in the box,  and why i didn't like them,  what the box looked like ect like an investigation.  I said ill bring the box back and i haven't eaten any of them i just want what i ordered.  So then she puts the supervisor on the phone and i had to re start my issue.  She said come in, well get it fixed.  Sooo i ran up there with my wrong order expecting a fight but the supervisor MORE than Made up for the issue.  I'll completely go back, but maybe ill check my order before i pull out.  Kudos to that supervisor,  she knew how to de-escalate the issue and make it right."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken.  New coupons with great deal every week.  I used to eat it every week.  The chicken is so juicy and tender.  I wish they could have more different flavors."}
{"text":"I never imagined a chain eatery like Churches could be this good!

I couldn't believe the wait that was ahead of us for chicken, but I soon realized why everyone was ordering large amounts, (probably supplying a big party somewhere).  I just don't know how well their drive-thru works if there is such a wait. 

The chicken is literately being flowered in their yummy recipe and fried to perfection, so these are not pre-packaged frozen chicken pieces. Yay! 

Now onto the biscuits...they are some of the best biscuits I have tried outside of home.  They had just come out of the oven and then a big squirt of honey butter goes right on top.  The biscuits are nice and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   

I will say, that the experience can vary depending on when the chicken and biscuits come out and that they haven't been sitting out too long.  Fresh out of the oven fryer are always best. So that's my tip!  

I am glad they cater to large parties, however I would also like if they equally consider those of us just ordering a 2 piece meal.

Overall, this has to be one of the yummiest chain produced fried chicken joint I've experienced."}
{"text":"I really don't know whats with the low ratings!
Church's is great! I love this one girl that works at the cash register. She is always smiling and is always so cheerful! The chicken here always comes out piping hot and juicy. In fact, everything that comes out of here just seems like it was made fresh for you! Doesn't feel like it's been sitting under a hot lamp for hours. Chicken skin is crispy, mashed potatoes with gravy is to die for, biscuits are fresh out of the oven, and the apple pie tastes like it came out of your grandmother's oven. Another big plus is the low price *cough* cheaper than KFC. They always seem to have a deal going on which I definitely appreciate."}
{"text":"Ordered a Grande Family meal and added 6 Biscuits. Arrived home just in time for the Stanley Cup Playoffs and realized they forgot my biscuits and forgot one out of two sides. The family was so disappointed, and we're finally giving up for sure on this location.  
Management at this location has been poor since it opened.  Nothing but the worst crew year after year.  It is rare to get good customer service here.  The communication alone is always concerning when your greeted with slang terminology, and or the attendant sounds as if they hate their job, and make you feel unwelcome. 
Goodbye Church's on S.Rainbow.  Nothing you offer is worth the grief anymore."}
{"text":"If you can get past the fact that most Church's are located in pretty ghetto areas, it's a decent place to get fried chicken.

I hadn't been to a Church's in probably 20 years and I don't know that I'll return anytime in the next two decades.

Overall, Church's is crispier than KFC but not as flavorful as Popeye's. It tasted good, but its nothing special. 

Similarly, service was... serviceable. They took my order and money and got my food.

If you want basic fried chicken this is a place for you."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest, not the friendliest, and probably a very unremarkable experience but dude, it's Church's.  You have to ask for the ketchup packets which is kind of annoying but I'm assuming there's a reason for everything.  It's probably been a good decade, if not longer, since the last time I went to a Church's ... not too different from the last time I went."}
{"text":"DUUUUUHHHHHHHH yesss... can i have de oter of de small side of bugs bic boisss and how much monneeey you'lo? isa buk lau"}
{"text":"Memories memories. Used to have Churches chicken at home and now I can have it hear in Las Vegas.  Love it."}
{"text":"This place is okay.. Went inside to order take out. Took about 15-20 min to have my order ready. 
The chicken was great nice fresh hot and juicy! Everything was great except my jalapeño bombers  and chicken sandwich which was a bummer! The jalapeño bombers taste like it's been sitting out the cheese inside was dried out... Biting in to it the cheese didn't burst out like it usually do when it's fresh it was just hard.

The chicken sandwich was boo boo nothing exciting... It used to taste better back in the days when it was just a regular bun, mayo, pickles and a piece of chicken tender. Now they make it with a fake frozen chicken patty. 

The inside is dirty and sloppy. Caps and straw wraps all on the counter. No one wiped the tables, I don't think I ever dined anywhere where you would need a key to use the restroom. It just feels unsanitary when you come inside."}
{"text":"Okay... Where do I start. If you are a chicken place than  have good chicken. I know when your chicken is made fresh is good crispy and juicy i had it before. but when your chicken sits there for a while it doesn't taste good. You shouldn't give your paying customers old chicken it doesn't taste good. You are losing paying costumers. 

Thank you"}
{"text":"Great chicken and friendly customer service. Ive never had a problem. People who complain about the wait obviously dont want fresh chicken. There should be a bin of chicken for those complainers. If you dont want to wait in the drive thru park your car and go inside you'll survive"}
{"text":"Much better option than the Popeyes down the road , open later, better service and better chicken."}
{"text":"We appreciated the fact that they were open on New Year's Eve.  And we been buying our Churches from this location for quite sometime.  What we didn't appreciate was the gentleman taking the orders pep talking his staff loud enough for everyone to hear.  His pep talk wasn't designed to hype the employees to work hard and fast so they can make it home to their families.  It was to give the customers within earshot a guilt trip for ordering Churches on New Years Eve.  

Well I'm sorry you had to work on New Years Eve. I do hope you all were able to make it home in time for the countdown.  At least you are able to do so while I on the other hand had to call it a night after having Churches for dinner at 930 PM because I had to work early AM on New Year's Day.  Not only did you make me feel guilty but did you have to give me and my whole family diarrhea?  

I know it wasn't deliberate and I'm sure the folks before me and after me probably got it too.  Were you all in such a hurry to leave that night and not care about making sure our food was not contaminated?  Did you change the oil?  Did you wash your hands before using them to dump the chicken in the fryer?  Did someone put something back in the refrigerator too late?  Or was it just a bad batch of chicken?"}
{"text":"Small, cramped, and serving the same disgusting chicken that this chain always has. Unfortunately, the KFC on Indian School is also a pit, so if you're craving fried chicken in South Scottsdale the only good option you have is LoLo's.

The second star is because the employees were nice."}
{"text":"This by far is the worse churches, the chicken is amazing, if you can get any, the employees are always rude, as well as management, they close every day at 830 even though the sign reads 9, and if you are there after 800 they claim to be out of chicken, this has happened numerous times on different days"}
{"text":"I heard from a friend that Church's sells fried okra.  Being from the south, it is an arduous journey finding okra of any kind in Central Arizona (Lee Lee Market carries fresh okra).  So, off we went to Church's.  I tend to eat mostly vegetarian, so I had a huge serving of fried okra (7.5 out of 10), some delicious cole slaw (10 out of 10), some biscuits (10 out of 10), and some corn on the cob (6 out of 10).  My family ate a lot of chicken and they said it was excellent (9 out of 10).  I will say the Dr. Pepper tasted mostly like sugar water (being from Texas, Dr. Pepper has to taste just right) - almost no flavor.  Service was very, very good.  The restaurant was very clean with lots of clean places to sit and eat.  Overall, an excellent choice for an inexpensive meal out."}
{"text":"Ok I went here last night, the staff was very nice. However... Myself and my girlfriend both got sick from the chicken, been in the bathroom all day, and she was on there all night lol, be warned...."}
{"text":"Oh boy.. OK here we go.. I wasn't gonna write this one but ya know sometimes places just piss me off!. I use to go to churches chicken many time a couple of years back but since it was so far away from my work I stopped going cause ya know.. Lunch time is short.  This day I was talking to a guy at work and he was saying how good KFC was. I said nope my fav is Church's. So that day I looked them up online and low and behold they opened this place a couple of miles away from work. So I went there for lunch.  I walked in and there were 4 people in there. I stepped up and placed my order. Total bill  $8.72. Reached into my wallet and had 9 bucks on me. I thought cool don't have to pull out the credit card. They handed me my .28 cents change and I sat  down to wait for my food. A couple of minutes later The lady informed me they were out of the spicy chicken and it would take about 6 minutes to make it. I said that was fine I would wait. Well the 6 minutes turned into 12... 13.... 14...minutes. Finally called me up.  She asked if I wanted ketchup. I said no but needed some hot sauce and a cup of ranch to dip my okra in. She threw a handful of hot sauce in the bag and informed me that the ranch was 39 cents. I looked at her and said I have never been charged for ranch before. She insisted she would not give me a cup. (remember my change was 28 cents.)So to this place and any other business that is listening. I hope that 39 cents you get for your ranch  is worth it.  I love your chicken but because of this extra charge you can keep you ranch and you chicken and anything else you want because this is one guy that will not return to you place of business. You hand me more hot sauce and ketchup  than I will ever use but not one cup of ranch?  Wow. OK sorry.. you asked for it. one star and another lost customer. Looking at your ratings I am not the first and wont be the last."}
{"text":"I've always used this drive thru, and I always tend to forget to check my order before I drive away... There's always something missing.

I drove on by and ordered a 12 piece mixed (leg and thigh) spicy chicken, that came with two large sides for $13.99. (You can get awesome coupons at church's.com) I also ordered a side of 6 biscuits for about $2. The drive thru was poppin (two cars in front of me) and and it took us about 10 minutes to to get to the window. 

When I got got home my biscuits were missing!! :( Why?!? I literally had a breakdown. LOL JK. No but really. The biscuits are the BEST part. They gave me the honey, charged me, but didn't give me the biscuits. Oh well wah. 

So make sure to double check your order!"}
{"text":"What's the point of keeping the drive through open if only two menu items will be available after closing the doors. I understand trying to limit closing costs and running out of stock but it seems a bit farfetched that they just so happen to not have certain items ready heading into closing hours. I've been to plenty establishments but only had the same issue in the old central location. Sad to see this is becoming the norm of an old childhood favorite."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of fried chicken  this place serves the good really well. The chicken is super crunchy on the outside which I love and on the inside it's just amazing. It's totally worth the buy"}
{"text":"Got a box of 10pcs original recipe mixed chicken pieces. The place was busy. I was out the door in less than two minutes. The food was hot and good. Excellent value.

Easy access off Southern or Country Club, best for northbound or westbound traffic, easy in and out. Good parking. Clean interior. No complaints!"}
{"text":"When I asked for all white meat chicken I thought I was getting what I wanted for the uplift. The cuts of the chicken were items I could not recognize as chicken let alone white meat chicken. The thing that had the Wing was so overcooked I could not recognize as chicken. On the plus side the okra was real good. 

Net net the chicken was not recognizable as chicken. Okra was good the biscuit was stale. So all in all I should have looked for a Kentucky fried chicken cause this place was not good."}
{"text":"This is the worst Churchs Chicken I have ever visited.  This is the second time in two visits that they have been out of chicken at 4:30 in the afternoon!  Had to wait 20 min to get Chicken and old tasting side dishes.  This location has a real bad management issues - avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Worst experience with church's chicken ever. This is why I choose else where for my chicken. I went through the drive thru And was attempting to place my order, but there was another customer behind me, blaring his music which made it impossible to ace my order. The lady who could barely speak English started yelling at me that she can't hear me and I need to turn my music down. When I told her it wasn't my music and try turning her speaker up she completely ignored me. After a few mins passed I yelled into the intercom hello to get some help, and she finally took my first order, she then cut me off and wouldn't let me finish taking my order. As I drove up the window she wouldn't even help me, she had someone else try to charge me for my food. Instead I got her name and the store info and went to corporate with my complaint. I'm which I still haven't heard any thing back from them"}
{"text":"It isn't in the best part of town, but the people who work in this establishment are emphatic about sending you home with happiness in your heart, and a belly full of mmm mmm good chicken!!  

Chicken Tenders or on the bone, Church's has a really decent product that won't wreck your dining budget.  The sides are really good as well.  And the biscuits?  Don't even get me started on that sweet manna from heaven!! :)

The icing on the cake is the leftovers. Tomorrow a.m. when I wake up - it'll be the first thing I think about after my morning prayers...\"How long till I can heat those goodies up?!\"  

I don't drive to KFC...no need to when I have my
neighborhood chicken champ right near by!"}
{"text":"The service was not that great however hubby and I love the chicken. Hopefully it still taste as great as it had did last time ;-)"}
{"text":"5 out of 5 times spicy chicken was ordered, and all 5 times they were \"out\" of spicy chicken.  Obviously their food is good that is the ONLY reason I go back. It is obvious their concern for customer service is not there, no sense of apology for the inconvenience or anything.  I hope their upper management can help with their issue. I recently discovered popeyes chicken and wow 10 times better."}
{"text":"Churches chicken is better then KFC. what else is there to say. 

Also go to the website they have coupons there. 

The spicy chicken is good."}
{"text":"I will tell you why they only got 3 stars....

here it goes the food was good...the chicken was great...but they didnt have fries or corn on the cob...it was like they were out of a lot of stuff...I was like maybe I shouldnt come here at night but damn it was dinner time...

how can you be out of french fries...they are so easy to make...come on!!!  Then he wants to give me some peppers to make up for it...come on buddy...a $0.40 peppers is to make up for your inconvience...umm no! what an insult....

Will I ever be back...yes..because of the chicken...but one more visit like this and I am done.

I think I am coming back only b/c the chicken was really good...
or maybe because I am black and I am predisposed to loving Fried Chicken...I donno lol"}
{"text":"I am new to eating at Churches. This is my second time dining with them and I was pleasantly surprised at how clean this store was. I say this because just across the street is a Jack in the box which accepts food stamps which means this neighborhood may be rough. I can see back into the kitchen floor and on the battering counter where the food was being freshly prepared and they were both clean. Everything in the dining room was freshly clean as well. The young man who I believe is named Ysidro and he was exceptionally nice knowing that we are newcomers. Not being from here I am not used to someone serving me being so nice. Thanks so much for the fresh and tasty food as well as great service!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, probably resulting from Manager who uses profanity to his staff and customers,he could care less who is listening. No problem with our order, I just had to wait 15 minutes for it.  Thanks for making me pay first, which I did with a credit card, then told my order will take 15 minutes.  How about ASKING me FIRST if I can wait that long at a FAST FOOD restaurant BEFORE taking my money!!  Just a thought.  It was fun waiting 15 minutes to see other customers come in and get even more infuriated that I was!"}
{"text":"In line 30 minutes and still got the order WRONG! No utensils, napkins or an apology. Rude and slow workers."}
{"text":"First, I'm being generous with the stars because this is a cheap fast food restaurant. If you expect a delicious shrimp dinner with great service for $4.44, you're overwhelmingly going to be disappointed. They're good for the money.

That said, I do expect to receive unburnt food, utensils, and all of the items in my order. Earlier in the week, I went through the drive thru and ordered the $4.44 shrimp dinner with fries and slaw. When I got home, I realized they didn't give me a fork for the slaw. It wasn't a big deal since I was home; but I couldn't have eaten it if I was eating on the go in my car, or taking it back to work. One of the fries tasted weird, like it was spoiled; but maybe that was the shrimp rubbing off on it.

Today, I ordered the same meal, but with macaroni and cheese. (It was just a utensil and one fry, and I love shrimp.) The mac n cheese was burnt on the top. Someone should have noticed that when they were serving it. Eh, OK. I'll remove the burnt part, and eat the rest. When I flipped it over, there was even More brown, burnt macaroni. Also, I didn't receive the biscuit which is so tasty.

Both times they misheard \"shrimp\" as \"chicken tenders\" and \"Dr. Pepper\" as \"Coke\"; but I caught that. Also, both times I didn't receive the free jalapeno with the meal.

I still like them better than other fast food restaurants. You just have to be alert when you go there to ensure you get everything you ordered, and unburnt."}
{"text":"Came here last week for lunch/ breakfast. My ex-roomate is a big fan of popeyes and I wanted to see how this would stack up. Of course, Im not a huge fan of fried chicken so I opted for the Chicken nugget option. They were good but a little small. fries were nice. Not alot of staff and service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Very surprised at these reviews. In Las Vegas with my wife last month and wanted to get some Church's chicken that was close to the Orleans Hotel and Casino where we were staying.  Google Maps led us to this place and we found the place to be exceptionally clean, the person waiting on us was very polite and friendly, and the chicken was hot and delicious.  We were from Chicago and go to a Church's Chicken on the west side and by comparison we thought this Church's was 10 times cleaner and faster than the one we go to purchase chicken at in Chicago. We enjoyed their chicken so much that we came for lunch a second time here and found the service and food to be the same-excellent!  Will return here for chicken the next time we are in Las Vegas and feeling the urge for Church's chicken."}
{"text":"I remember LOVING to go to this side of town and grabbing Church's Chicken! WOW has things changed. The establishment has always been a bit worn down, but is even more so over the years. The chicken isn't as crispy and juicy as I remembered. They make giant batches of fried chicken at a time so there is barely any guarantee of freshness. The honey-buttered biscuits used to be a crunchy, warm, giant ball of fluff, smothered in oh so sweet honey butter. Now? It's chewy biscuit drenched in honey butter and served at room temperature. WHY or HOW is it chewy?!?!

Not only has the quality dropped, the service is horrible. The gentleman in front of me placed his order and stepped to the side. I proceeded to place mine. The cashier stops me and rudely states that the gentleman is first. He says he already placed his order and she snaps \"Our system is down!\" Finally it's my turn to order and guess what? This was the interesting part... she says \"That's it?\""}
{"text":"The wait is never ending! Why is this place so slow! Two cars ahead of us and we're been waiting about 20 mins already. If we didn't have a car behind us then we would have already been gone! This is just sad and Church's Chicken is suppose to be FAST FOOD!! Wth!"}
{"text":"Great food, great value! I have never been disappointed here. If I am in the \"Chicken\" mood... forget KFC, forget Popeyes (both nearby), skip them, go to Churches. I just had the Shrimp and Tenders deal (added a drink for $1)... I am totally satisfied right now. The Lemon & Herb dipping sauce, was Amazing! I never had that sauce before, but Now I Know, it is Great! Go to Churches Yall"}
{"text":"Best chicken strips around. Great service and the employees go out of their way to make sure that your orders are right and fresh. 2 choices of gravy for the potatoes.  They beat KFC everytime. Just remember that this review is for this location only."}
{"text":"I really like Church's Chicken but this place is a sorry excuse of a Church's Chicken their managers are always rude their workers are rude and their food is undercooked like the chicken will come out with cold and raw do not eat here people if you want to get sick that I seen roaches in this restaurant I think it's just this part of town sucks"}
{"text":"There where roaches and flies in the dinning area, as well as the restroom. The staff was polite but I couldn't eat the food because I was too grossed out."}
{"text":"***ROACHES*** bad case of creepy crawly roaches and not just sewer roaches but the little residential roaches climbing on the walls and food containers. I immediately reported this to the health department. DON'T EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets 3 stars is because the food is always good. The customer service on the other hand is horrendous. They're ALWAYS out of menu items and I had to repeat my order THREE DAMN TIMES to the guy that took it. And he managed to forget my biscuits even after hearing it three times. I honestly don't know how he still has his job."}
{"text":"Every time I bought 10 pc, I just want legs, they give me legs, so I appreciate it, I will coming every week!"}
{"text":"very bad customer service & bad chicken that should have been thrown away instead of given to a customer.  the chicken was very dry, hard, and appeared to have been sitting there for alot longer than it should have.  all the outiside of he chicken couldn't be eaten and the biscuits were so hard as well.  my total was $26.00, and the manager on wanted to replace what wasn't eaten which was most of the order and only give me back 8.99 if i wanted a refund.  manager issac was very rude and has not customer service skills, and is making a good brand a bad name. very bad service for the westside!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I've tasted better, but those little corn side things are yummy. I wish they'd get some gizzards... or at least some buzzards."}
{"text":"Make sure to ask for whatever you need. I think this location practice the \"If they don't ask for it don't offer it!\" Policy! 

Chicken is pretty darn good and their biscuit has gradually gotten bigger or should I say normal size. From the 1st day they open they served these bite size popper biscuits, I guess they were trying to cut some corners or skim and save money. But believe me I was shocked when I saw that and I was like what the h-e-double hockey stick is this. 

Any how I only come here for the drive thru because their dinning room is extremely small and has a weird feeling or vibe to it that I from the get go that drive me away. On one side if the build hasn't even been finished and looks like it still under construction for the pass like 3 or however many years they've been opened. Anyhow if you've had Churches you can expected the same food here for the most part so it is satisfying I only do Drive thru here!"}
{"text":"12:58PM February 19 2018 poooooool customer service. 
I order 14 pieces fried chicken and thigh. At the Drive through.  pulled forward to the window,paid and wait for my order. I ask for if I can get any ranch sauce after the window opened. \"37cent each \" the guy behind the window told me. I told him I can't understand that u guys even charge for the sauce. I pay u 15 more dollars and only get some napkins. He shut the window while I am talking to him.  Of cause there is no even one pack of sauce inside of our order no matter hot sauce or ranch or something else. Pooooool customer service. Never go back again."}
{"text":"Run- do not eat here
Several hours after eating here-I got sick.  From both ends.  This place needs to be shut done.  The owner was an ass - he has problems with either women or Americans. Sad part he tired to tell me what I should order.   The chicken had no season what so ever."}
{"text":"This place is crap! I come here because I like church's chicken a lot and with it not being to far from me I chose this one. But I'm over it, the customer service sucks, no matter what time of day you go you have to wait like literally 15 mins for your food and it's not even fresh like why did I have to wait so long. They NEVER have condiments (honey, honey mustard) every time I would go they were always out of something I wanted, for example the apple pie or okra. Today did it for me when I waited like 20 mins (no joke) for a more for $4 box and to top it off for my wait they have me a coupon paper that expired the same day"}
{"text":"I love me some Church's chicken! I prefer Church's over KFC and Popeye's. The biscuits here are amazing. They have a sweet glaze brushed over the tops of them. Best biscuits ever. Now for the star of the show, the chicken. You can choose spicy or regular flavored chicken. I always get spicy, because it's not very spicy. They always have a special going on and right now it's 2 pieces of chicken and 2 small sides for $2.99. 

I was really hungry, so I ordered a combo with 3 pieces of chicken, a side (coleslaw), and a drink and it was just under $7. I waited about 5 minutes and my food came out. Everything was good. The chicken was crispy and hot. The slaw is mayo based and has a nice tang. I also like the jalapeño poppers and Mac and cheese. They have other offerings like chicken sandwiches and I think fried shrimp, but I haven't tried those items. 

The downside is that this particular location is very small, and gets cramped quickly. When you walk through the front door, the counter is right there just a few feet away. Most of the time they are busy so it gets very cramped when more than 5 people are waiting in line to order or waiting to pick up their food. This location also has a drive thru, but it is also small and cramped so beware. It is very hard to get in and out of this parking lot.

{"text":"The food and service was alright. The staff was friendly. It is a tough spot to get in and out of.  The food is ok, nothing to write home about. It's good for the price, but there is better around town."}
{"text":"Normally I love Churchs Chicken but for some reason today it was tasteless. Was also disappointed that they don't have Cajun Rice here and don't provide butter nor honey for biscuits. Needless to say I cancelled the biscuit order. I'm not hispanic but cashier tried to speak Spanish at the window.  Hopefully when I return there will be more flavor . Don't want to have to drive to S. Rainbow to get my Churchs fix."}
{"text":"I eat here every now and then mainly when I have coupons and have yet to have a bad experience. Sometimes my chicken comes as strips when I order fried but the food still tastes good and has been always fresh. The employees are always nice and give good customer service. Great place to get cheap fried fast food."}
{"text":"I was greeted by this young man named Jose he was really nice and gave me plenty of info and recommended meals that fit my needs ! I ordered a $45.00 piece meal and it took them 8 mins or less. Marconi is so soft she and chewy."}
{"text":"Mexican girl refused to serve us as she stated she didn't have too. 
We left and dos file a formal complaint against the restaurant with all the appropriate authorities. as all we did was place a order and she had attitude. People need to be very careful who and how they conduct theirselves. I don't recommend this restaurant in Chandler as its employees are unprofessional not to imagine what they do to your food if they are upset and unhappy. 
They need to be shut down or fire all the staff their like they have done at several Churches Chx. Take a page out of Popeyes book.

Be kind to all that keep you employed,

Seriously sincere"}
{"text":"First of all, I waited 15 minutes on the drive through. I timed it. Not only they took a fucking leap year, they gave me 2 pieces of the jalapeño cheese bombers, dumped my fries in a plastic bag and hid it under the 20 piece I ordered, and the cap on my spicy rice was loose. They forgot my gravy and I watched every fucking employee walk around doing fucking nothing while 4 cars behind me were waiting. This man asked me if I'd like any ketchup or honey or sauce and I said yes please give me everything. After fucking 15 minutes of waiting, the woman who handed me my order asked me if I wanted any sauce. The communication is fucking garbage and the employees. The only thing good are the food. I actually took time of my own to rate this shitty service store. That's how fucking bad they are."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Church's Chicken a few weeks ago. I finally stopped in for lunch today and was underwhelmed. When I ordered tender strips I was asked the question \"Original?\". I had to ask if there were other choices. After I received my order I was asked if I wanted any sauces. After asking what the options were and receiving a single packet of honey BBQ I had to ask for a second packet. No condiments were available without specifically asking for them. The coating on the tender strips was very pale suggesting that it was a bit undercooked. However, the coating was somewhat crispy. The chicken itself seemed just on the verge of being overcooked."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I've never had something that wasn't good or fresh. The only problem is that the associates are completely incompetent. I had a coupon from online that I printed out and took in 2 separate times. I guess it isn't a coupon they get regularly because they messed up my order BOTH times. One time they forgot to give me the biscuits that came with my meal and the second time they shorted me an order of mashed potatoes. I learned my lesson and checked my order before I left the second time. When I told them they charged me for potatoes that I didn't get they gave me money back...I told them I don't want my money back I want my order of potatoes. They called a manager over...who couldn't speak English and insisted that I take my money back. I calmly explained that I don't want my money. I want my correct order. The thing that really made me angry is that they were not listening to what I wanted. I was very calm, patient, and clear because I also work in customer service but they kept trying to just get me out of their drive through without listening to my problem. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"I usually don't leave reviews on fast food restaurants but the fries were pitiful. How dare you serve cold,old, stale fries to your customers? Majority of people will wait 3 minutes for them to come out of the deep fryer. Goodness."}
{"text":"I love Church's Chicken the food is amazing far better than Popeyes and KFC definitely my favorite chicken place."}
{"text":"Two stars for the Jalapeño cheese bombers because they're bombbb!! Service isn't great which bring down the rating."}
{"text":"Time for fast food and fried chicken.  The line was short and got served promptly.  The skin is always nice and crunchy . The chicken is not overcooked.  They offer good coleslaw and mashed potatoes and  gravy"}
{"text":"This spot is open 24 hours and is a short walk from our house. That means we only visit between 1-4 in the morning on weekends. And when we visit, we're hungry and somewhat desperate.

We always get the same thing. I get a 2-piece chicken leg meal. The Hubster gets a chicken sandwich. We spirit it home and mow it down like a pair of disgusting hyenas. And we love every single minute of it. I find their chicken actually better than KFC and I don't get that instant gut rot upon finishing my meal. The servings are also much larger.

Service is always friendly, which is much more than you say about other spots open late. Because it's not close to an kind of night life, it isn't full of terrible partiers, either.

I hope this place stays around forever."}
{"text":"At least KFC said they didn't have chicken at the moment during rush hour...Churches let me order in the drive thru and I sat for almost 20 minutes for some chicken... I'm over them both!"}
{"text":"Amazingly bad service. I tell the guy my order, he asks what kind of drink I say coke, I get to the window and he's like \"so that was a strawberry fanta right?\" \"no, coke\" comes back like 15 min later hands me a strawberry fanta... at this point we've already been waiting a while so I'm like whatever. I asked for ranch, he charged us for it, we get home, no ranch, and missing the only order of french fries (also charged). Will never go back."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders was alright. The picture on look a lot better than how it was made. The regular chicken has more flavor. Will stick to the fried chicken. And Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Never disappointing, always get my chicken strips made to order, & I don't even have to ask. Friendly service and always recommend this place to my buddy's."}
{"text":"Didn't make it out to Church on Easter Sunday but I did make it to Church's Chicken... so that's close enough. 

Came in with my friend on our way home and were told they were out of chicken for 20 minutes.  

We waited patiently for our food to be prepared.  I noticed, the place wasn't running their AC, which made it a bit uncomfortable and there was no available seating outside, so we manned up and dined here.  At least they had ice available for our drinks, which made the situation manageable. 

When our food came out, my friend and I were pleased with the size and quality.  We had extra condiments as well as napkins, all were needed as their chicken has always known to be more on the greasier side... which explains the great taste. 

I had a four piece meal, fries and their famous honey biscuit.  I left full with extra money in my pocket which was a plus. 

This place needs to improve on inventory and put on the air conditioning.  Las Vegas is hot, granted it was the first of the month, April Fools, but don't mess or joke around with people's comfort when they are dining in your place. 

Kudos to the two member team that worked on Easter Sunday.  They were friendly, hard working and honest.  

I wouldn't hesitate to visit this place when I'm in town, since the food was good, hopefully, management will take my review into consideration and work on improving their establishment. 

See you in a few weeks."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Very good taste to everything, and their 'spicy' is comfortably the spiciest compared to any other chicken chain. That just gives them enough to round up to a 4 star review since I have to choose, but the fact that their chicken isn't too meaty holds them back a bit - which is the same qualm I had with them in BC. I do love that they serve jalapeno poppers and their fries are better than they look.

Better than KFC and Popeye's, but it can't unseat Mary Brown's from the throne of chain fried chicken places."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning not once, but two different times at this location out of the 8 or so times I went here over the last year. 

I will never eat at this location again. 

This wasn't some \"maybe\" food poisoning. It was full on throwing up and not being able to leave the bathroom for a good 48 hours. Both times I had someone else eat w/ me and we both got horribly sick. 

The 2nd time, I called to tell the manager and she just said she would remind her employees to be sure to wash their hands.

There was no apology or recourse offered to me. 

This is clearly a food handling issue, not just a hand washing issue.

Go here if you want to run a high risk of getting food poisoned.

Also, just like other reviews stated - the service here is the worst. They've made me pay and then wait for 15+ min when there's like 1 other customer inside. More than once they've told me they ran out of biscuits.. again AFTER I've paid and sat there waiting 15+ min for my order. 

This location needs to get it's sh*t together. Only reason I went so many times is because it was nearby. Never again."}
{"text":"You have to forgive me as I am a little sad today. One of the cheapest, and best chicken places has gone totally down hill. In the world of fast food chicken places it is normally a choice between KFC or Church 's. In fact until today I would have said Church 's by a mile. Disagree? Then let 's talk price for a minute. 

When you can get eight pieces of chicken, four biscuits,  a side of mashed potatoes and gravy plus coleslaw all four around $10 then there is no choice involved. There is just me asking for some hot sauce and a pile of napkins. (LOL) But after moving to Michigan for a few years and having no choice but to pay the super high prices the colonel commands from his troops (customers),  I was looking forward to moving back to Arizona and some good fried chicken. 

But somehow things are never as great as you remember them. My first experience with Church 's was not only a disappointment but a slap in the face. Forgotten were the memories sweetened by the warm honey butter biscuits I used to enjoy. Gone were the days when I sat with my grandma and feasted on tasty fried chicken. Now all that remains is the smell of burned food that taste like it had been made three days before and reheated till it was almost charcoal.  

I mean come on I like dark meat but this was ridiculous. Maybe to increase profits they were selling this cremated fowl as fuel to KFC to make their grilled chicken with (LOL). But seriously though the food was really bad. The biscuits looked like the kind you buy at the store just with a little smear of honey and were rock hard. This is to bad because they sold one of the better tasting biscuits sold by a chain ( KFC 's taste like they used to much flour, and Popeye 's is way to salty for my taste). 

The bottom line is with great power comes great responsibility. If you have a great product do not mess with it. Just keep cranking it out and offering it at a affordable price. Why? It is simple, because you will make a lot of money.(LOL) I only hope that someone at Church 's will awaken from this nightmare and start making the food that makes good memories instead of just making people sick."}
{"text":"I'm always in the area so it's convient for me to pick up some bomb ass fried chicken on the way home. Hands down Church's is way better than Popeyes or KFC. I got the 12 piece family meal & it came with the 1/2 gallon sweet tea, nothing screams southern comfort like sweet tea & fried chicken!! I never had a problem ordering from the drive thru & the cashier guy was cool. Quick service. Fresh hot crispy chicken. Craving satisfied."}
{"text":"Terrible nothing like the south.  Don't recommend.  I order 3 chicken tenders in the south 5 are in the box hot and good in Arizona I order 12 and they look like crawfish so small and not hot.  Stay away"}
{"text":"I had gone through the drive-thru, the end of October of 2015, where this rude individual behind me kept honking his horn at me and at churches employees. But everyone thought I was the one doing it so I was getting rude comments and rude looks from passersby. And church's chicken employees did nothing but tell me to pull out and park in front of the store so they could attend to this rude customer while pushing me back. They said  no apologies and did nothing to help me but make me wait another twenty minutes for my food. Then when the rude customer got their food decided to yell rude comments at me in front of the store and yet everyone was looking at me like I did something wrong. It was mortifying!! Finally when I got my food I received nothing but cold attitude from the girl handing me the food and the employee on the phone when I try to contact a manager. This has made me boycott all church's chicken. And it's sad because I really did enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Chicken was pretty good and the spices were decent, but I still prefer Popeyes. And this location is too far for me when a Popeyes is literally a five minute drive away. Maybe I'll come back for a spicy chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Was passing through the area on a Thursday night and was looking for some dinner. Saw this Church's chicken and decided to stop, mainly because it looked newer than other Church's locations in town. This is my first experience with a Church's in Vegas, and it was actually pretty good. The only negative came while I was trying to place my order. There was a couple people in front of me, but when it was my turn at the counter, the manager stepped away to help fill some orders while asking me to wait a few min..this was kind of awkward since I was just standing there watching him...Once he was done, my order was taken, I filled my drink cup and sat down. 

Despite the line, my order came out fairly quickly and everything was piping hot and fresh. So hot I might add that I felt like I was buring my fingers when breaking apart pieces of chicken. We had a 10 piece with mac and cheese and jalapeno bombers. The chicken was crispy and juicy, and not overcooked like Smith's. The mac and cheese was good and the jalapeno bombers had a little kick to it, which surprised me as well. All in all it was a good experience and I would come back if in the area again."}
{"text":"I always love churches chicken.. I like the spicy chicken a lot .. Just wish tey cud hv a more clean ambience"}
{"text":"Just downright good greasy food.

Honey biscuit is just sickenly good. Better than Popeye's chicken, which is damn good in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for good southern fried chicken place. Church's may not be perfect, but it is good.

I came in here yesterday to avoid driving through a Dust Storm Haboob. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W4Cx44XKZ4. If you have never seen one, click on the link. It turns a sunny day, into a yellow hazed sunset, or worse. 

The restaurant was clean, service polite and friendly. There was a few other patrons here, who were munching down on their food and seeming to enjoy themselves. As I waited for my order, I started reading the mostly one and two review Yelp'ers, one star take of Church's and began to wonder if I was in the wrong place. Then I came across Javier's brief five star offering which seemed closer to reality. 

The Haboob outside aside, this was a pretty good chicken place. Three and a half stars good, or as they say on Yelp \"A-Okay\". 

I had the Chicken Sandwich, two strips on a thick cut white bread with mayo, lettuce and tomato for $2.99. Not bad, better if it had three, but...  I also tried their three piece boneless wings for $2 something. All this with my drink came to $6.79, which wasn't a steal but I thought fairly priced. 

So I will be back in the near future to try their other offerings. Sadly, the southern delicacy of Liver is not on the menu. Sorry Yelp'er Sue from Ocala, FL!  I'll just need to take a trip and visit you to get some."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Cashier well groomed and friendly. Its been said not healthy. I will indulge every once and awhile. Excellent price for the quantity. Definitely hot food. Blow before eating definitely the mash potatoes. Sweet tea"}
{"text":"OK place to grab a quick lunch - bought the 2 piece lunch special - comes with 2 sides, a biscuit, and a jalapeño

Got a leg and thigh and mashed potatoes/gravy and cole slaw, a biscuit, but no jalapeño.

Chicken was decent, and hard to wreck mashed potatoes and gravy.  Cole slaw was pretty good also.  Biscuit was kind of hard, but tasted pretty good.  

The (missing) jalapeño really didn't have much flavor..."}
{"text":"Simply put, I will not be going back to this location. They are set on charging customers more than they should for food and drink.

Basically the issue comes to an advertised special that I ordered. Drinks were a certain addition more. That would be fine, but when upgrading the drink from the special, they insist on charging that amount plus. All other restaurants, including fast food places I have visited charge a certain amount for their medium size for instance, and then the difference for the upgraded drink. Charging the difference only is the method in which all other restaurants work, but not this Church's Chicken.

I tried discussing this with the person at check out and she didn't want to assist. When the manager came in, he was directed to visit my table and not at my request. He asked if he could sit at my table, I said no thanks and he sat down anyway. After he kept going over the same point that Church's Chicken policy is to charge the promotional price on top of a fully priced drink, I decided it was time to collect my tray, toss out the refuse and leave.

The last words I heard from him were, \"have a nice life.\" Wow, that's A+ customer service. At no time did I ask for a refund or a voucher for a future visit. If this is a company policy, then it should be changed. Customers would appreciate it."}
{"text":"We waited for 25 minutes in drive up with only 1car in front of us and then they didn't even have our drives ready.  We won't be back even through the chicken strips were very tasty!"}

{"text":"We get to the box \" wait time 10 minutes\"

We get to the window \"we ran out again, 20 minutes wait\"

Tells us to come inside and wait

Doesn't apologize for the wait and doesn't give any free upgrades or biscuits.


This is why you have one star."}
{"text":"I like this place. The chicken is decent....not too greasy. It's much better than KFC. I am not a huge fan of chicken with bones (I'm weird that way) so I always get the chicken tenders and they are pretty decent. Especially with their honey mustard sauce. I prefer a side of potatoes and gravy over the French fries. The biscuits are yummy of you get them hot and fresh.
It's fast food but it's decent fast food.
The service here is also pretty good. I try not to go inside fast food locations so I don't get freaked out by what I see and end up going hungry so I can't speak for the cleanliness of the location."}
{"text":"I know the name church is in the name but I pray everytime I'm in there that I don't get sick... again. Service is pretty good but someone back there isn't washing there hands or something"}
{"text":"Had their new menu item, the chicken fingers and shrimp. Nothing special and I wouldn't necessarily order it again, but the price was right. However other reviews were right. This place doesn't offer/give you anything unless you ask for it. Got home and for 3 meals, we got no utensils not any sauces or napkins."}
{"text":"Slow service, lady at drive thru can be brusque. Food is so so. Stingy with the sauces. 
Having once worked for Church's, I know they can do better."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Church's Chicken at 12040 N 35th Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85029 for a while. Every time I go there, I am impressed with Giovanni and his staff. Giovanni is always helpful, courteous, and polite. There is another gentleman with a moustache who is also very polite and helpful. It is a pleasure going there as I always get great food and am treated well. They know what customer service is all about."}
{"text":"I have to agree with my fellow Yelpers on both cleanliness and service.  This location is way under par and needs a thorough scrubbing.  Additionally, the service conveyed the idea that I was a nuisance and that they would rather I not bother them (which, of course, I won't).  Maybe their regulars are accustomed to this, but I cannot imagine I will return (ultimately, this is management issue and since ALL their Charlotte locations score so poorly on Yelp, it's upper management).  Somebody just doesn't give a ****!  

As for quality, my chicken was piping hot just out of the fryer.  I just don't get their butchering techniques (they butcher the chicken across the backbone, so no traditional cuts except the legs).  Therefore, in order to get more white meat, you have to order larger boxes with more pieces, which includes more dark meat which I don't prefer, and at a higher overall cost.  

For me it is quite simple . . . Church's Chicken is neither a Diner, Drive-in or Dive--it's a Dump.  I'll keep going to Price's!  They do chicken right."}
{"text":"Part of the reason I go to a fast food drive-thru is because it's supposed to be fast. There were 4-5 cars ahead of me. It took us 25-30 minutes to get our food. We couldn't escape because we were trapped with other cars behind us. The wait is unacceptable for fast food standards. The food was alright but I'd rather go somewhere else where it's fast."}
{"text":"This is the last stop for the MN crew!! CHURCH'S CHICKEN BAAAAABY! I'm like YOU GOTTA TRY THE SPICY CHICKEN! 
They are closed so we hit the drive thru. 

Anyway, I know this chicken is damn good. It's juicy and spicy and they have good corn and mashed potatoes with gravy. NOM. GET IT!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at how Church's has turned themselves around.  In the eighties it was a hot new property that was opening stores all over the place. I guess over-expansion hit; and didn't they go bankrupt? 

Anyway, we came to this location recently and really enjoyed the food. 

They have a sign inside that states they were judged better then Popeye's.  Now, I find it unusually that a franchise would mention a competitor when you have already made the decision to go there and eat.  

Made me wonder where the nearest Popeye's is located???  But the food was really very good.  And maybe, just maybe as good as Popeye's."}
{"text":"Talking about today the guy that was closing tonight deserves 5star he was on point with customer service he must be new to this location I come to this location  all the time."}
{"text":"Quick, bright, friendly and super yummy! I still prefer Mary Brown's up at Bovaird & Hurontario but when you can't get up there this place is perfect. Forget KFC and super greasy Popeyes. This place is great."}
{"text":"Decided to give it another shot.  Got a 3-piece meal and the dude told me they were out of white meat (how can you be a chicken place and be OUT of white meat chicken?!) didn't matter to me though because I prefer dark meat.  Dude even gave me 4 pieces instead of 3 to make up for it.

HOWEVER, the only flavor was yet again that of old grease.  Disgusting.  This time I DEFINITELY won't be back!!"}
{"text":"Being from the south, I love my Church's chicken, but the service there was amazing. I wish I could remember their names to give them credit but the manager and other employee have us a great experience. Not a fan of the owners since they are known to be cheap but they hire people better than themselves so we will be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and I used the drive thru.  I had to park and wait 10 minutes for my 4 piece strip meal.  I got home and realized my side was missing.  I literally paid $8 for 4 chicken strips only.  I called and they offered to replace my meal.  I tried the chicken though and it was terrible - mushy and bland.  I will not be going back and I'm angry I spent the money in the first place."}
{"text":"I was shorted 2 sides. I spoke to the manager/owner AJ who replied to me with racial sarcastic remarks. I never received an apology or my refund. Even his employees confirmed that he is prejudice. I will never return to this location"}
{"text":"The best chicken in town hands down, and the sides, especially the biscuits, are the best,oh my!!! When you need a fried chicken, mashed potato experience it doesn't dissapoint!"}
{"text":"Went here to get a quick dinner for the kid last night between his karate class and our gym session. Not a particularly good experience. The guy behind the counter was efficient enough, the food came out quick enough (we only bought a small chicken sandwich for the kid), but eating there was a MISTAKE. There was some ghetto-talking girl running the drive through and between customers she engaged in this loud, foul-mouthed diatribe. \"She gon' say she want mah job, well she can go ahead and just take my f^ckin' job.. she say she gon' call child whatever on me that's fahn wid me know wh'am sayin', she k'n go  f^ck herself!\" etc.. then a second later, sweet as molasses, \"Hi, welcome to Church's Chicken, how may I help you?\". My kid's not even 6 yet. I don't want him hearing the f-bomb every ten seconds in a so-called family restaurant.

I've had a good experience once, too - driving through, I spoke to a Sikh gent who may have been the manager, he seemed quite nice and offered me a free drink since I was wearing my karate gi and he thought I was one of the senseis at the karate place just opposite, but they need to work on their hired help and set some ground rules while on duty. Going by what happened to us and to the previous reviewer, they appear to have absolutely no problem in hiring complete ghetto trash. If that's what they talk like, god only knows what sort of biological waste products my kid might have eaten on his sandwich last night. Not planning to return, and if this keeps up I'm expecting the place to fold pretty soon.

Incidentally, I just read the filtered reviews of this place. I suggest you do as well. Wow."}
{"text":"Drove 20 minutes to get to the restaurant because Church's Chicken used to be wonderful. 

This review is for the drive thru. Staff was super friendly though had trouble hearing us in the speaker. We drove up to the window to order.

We just started eating paleo so asked if they did lettuce wrapped chicken sandwiches instead of buns. The staff said yes they do lettuce wraps and so we ordered 2 of them with ice tea for the drink. Can't go wrong with boring basic Lipton tea, that's what we got.

I remember how good Church's chicken was as a kid so really looked forward to this.

In a few moment they gave us one box in a bag and we were on our way home.

When we opened it we find two small salty chicken strips with a small cup of chopped up lettuce on the side. To call them strips is overdoing it. These were like flattened chicken byproduct mcnuggets fried or perhaps microwaved in a thin batter. 

Even with both of these there was definitely not enough meat for a sandwich and this was no wrap. My wife tasted her flat slab of mystery meat and it was pure salt. 

The whole experience was completely unacceptable and we just threw the stuff in the trash. Mine looked so gross I didn't even try it.

Couldn't even give it to the dogs.

I am so sad if this is what Church's has become. I will return some day for chicken 3pc or what not and hope it's better, though my confidence is low.

Parting advice: Do not order chicken wraps."}
{"text":"They overcook the chicken and then put it under 208V heat lamps to further dry it out. Churches used to be quite excellent but the modern cooking methods require DRY leathery chicken. I tried a two piece before placing a twenty piece order. Needless to say, I did NOT want a larger order of substandard food. I surrendered and went to McDonalds for their double quarter pounders with cheese."}
{"text":"On Christmas eve, we were completed unplanned with dinner after driving around looking at Christmas lights. Most places had been closed for hours, but we drove by Church's at around 9pm, maybe later, and we saw folks ordering at the outside window so we came over. We placed our order and waited.
I looked at the door hours for that day, and they were suppose to have closed long before we got there. I looked inside at the employees, thinking they probably hated all of us for continuing to order, but they were all so happy looking, joking with each other....even the family waiting for them in the lobby were patient and courteous. 
The shift leader, Daniel, who was working today March 6th 2016, was also working Christmas eve and I remembered how nice he was and happy and joking with the customers, my husband and myself included. This man Daniel, and his staff were excellent and said as long as people needed food, they would be helping us. I'm sure he knew we didn't have many options to get quick food being it was Christmas eve, but I will always remember how much he and those people cared. The food was freaking great too!"}
{"text":"We went through the drive-thru.  We ordered a 3 pc leg/thigh meal with sides and a 3 pc tenders meal with sides.  The guy asked if he can put them all in one box?  Wth???  We said no because the other order was for our kids who were going to eat it in the backseat.  

Before we leave, we always check our orders.  Everything was right except the guy already closed his window and walked away.  We waited in the car for a while thinking he was getting us what we're missing.  Nope, he never came back.  My husband had to knock on the window several times to get their attention.  They didn't give us any napkins.  No utensils even though we have mashed potatoes in our order.  No sauces were offered at all.  Omg!!!

When the same man came back to the window he was so rude!!!  He was a middle aged middle eastern man.  I can't believe how bad of a service we got here. No wonder there are never customers!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just wanted fries. The drive through smelled like sewer, the warning on the window said they might fry anything in reused fish oil. Ick. I'm vegetarian. I could barely stand the smell of the bag of food, let alone eat more than one fry without thinking of all the rotting fish flesh residue I might be eating. Fortunately family was not bothered by fish and ate the fries for me."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it, but yes, I do eat here occasionally.  About once every couple of months I break all the rules and get some junk food during lunchtime at work.  I happen to love fried chicken and it just so happens that this place is about a ten second drive from my office and is really the only place around.

I get the same thing every time I go:  the chicken strips with ranch dipping sauce and a giant diet coke.  SOOOO good but SOOOO bad for me.  It screws up my stomach for about a day and I always swear I'll never go back but I always do.

It is a bit on the expensive side for fried strips of chicken but whatever.  It is quick and easy and the people that work there are always friendly and quick with your order."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, the food was not fresh, both the orders were wrong. The wait was at least 15 min and the food sat at the window for 5 of them. I didn't even wanna go back to fix the problem I just threw my food away. I will not be returning to this location, and sadly it was my first church's chicken experience. I hope that they aren't all like this. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I got a mixed of original and spicy chicken. Chicken are good, crunchy but juicy inside, and not dry at all! The guy was really nice."}
{"text":"The Chicken is far better than KFC! The menu is almost identical to KFC. This location just opened and the Grand Opening is on Saturday, November 25, 2017. Very clean restaurant and the staff are friendly. The speed of service is quite good; but the restaurant is still new and not much of traffic.

I had had Texas Mexicana as well as a BBQ sandwich combos. Both were mind blowing. The TexMex is made with a spicy Mayo which is quite good on your taste buds. Not soggy and not pasty - if my writing makes sense. The fillings comprise of proper Tomato slices and Onions with Lettuce in a sufficient quantity. Quite the contrast to the Lettuce attacks by KFC and McDonalds. The fries were nicely done with the curly cut.

The Restaurant was very clean during both visits. Friendly staff greets you the moment you open the door. The wait times were less than 10mins.

In all aspects, better than KFC. And I WAS a KFC fan."}
{"text":"Wish I could give them zero stars.  Can't believe I sat in the drive through for almost 30 minutes....and I was sandwiched in between cars...or else I would have left.  I will never come to this location again"}
{"text":"I stop by for the summer meal deal and was expecting everything that comes with it. Instead I only got chicken mashed potatoes and coleslaw when I asked about the drink they said they were out of the Tea. So asked if they can substitute something else for it. They said they could give me biscuits........... REALLY......im supposed to wash my food down with a biscuit...........i asked if they could at least give me a drink to substitute not getting the iced tea smh...they said no. How the hell does that make sense? I will never return to Church until they learn how to  be guest friendly.  To top it off my chicken thighs were dried out tough to eat. Wish I read the reviews first."}
{"text":"I love fried chicken! I'm not from the south. From Hawaii in fact, but I love fried chicken. It's my favorite comfort food. It hits the spot when I can't think of something I'm craving. Nothing beats home cooked but...

I grew up on KFC. Then moving to the mainland, I discovered Church's and I am home. It's a quick fix but a delicious one at that. It's perfectly crispy and the meat is moist and juicy. Not salty like others out there. 

And the biscuits! Oh my goodness the biscuits. Now KFC has theirs but Church's biscuits are memorable! Glazed with butter and honey, it's a heart attack meal waiting to happen. But if you keep it an occasional visit, you're fine.  Their chicken strips are also good. I'm not a fan of them in general but if it's from Church's, it's getting in my belly.

I like to bring home the meal, cook up a pot of rice and feast. Am I Asian or what?! ;)"}
{"text":"I was a fan of Churches chicken till I came to this location. Oh where do I begin. First they no longer have the popcorn chicken my kids liked so I ordered them 3 ( remember that number for later) chicken tenders. I ordered the 3 (not yet) piece meal all dark meat. I got our cups and got drinks for my kids. I wanted ice tea but the dispenser on the counter was empty. The person working the counter said he would fill my cup for me but his dispenser was almost empty. As we waited other customers came in and ordered. All of us were sitting around waiting for them to cook the food nothing was ready. When we got our food my kids 3 (ok now) piece tenders turned into 4 and my all dark meat meal had a breast in it. People who were going through the drive in were now coming inside to find out where there orders were. I went to get a refill on my ice tea but they were out."}
{"text":"The kids and I like Church's Chicken but this location isn't great.  It's inside Arizona Mills Mall food court so not as easy to access for take out.  I was purchasing dinner for 4 adults and 2 children.  I was unable to order what I wanted.  There was no way to specify what type of fried chicken I received, even by paying a premium.  We wanted 12 biscuits and were told even though they had 12 biscuits prepared that we couldn't have them all because they are required to have 4 on display at all times.  When I was there the food court was pretty empty and no one bought food from Church's other than us in the entirety of our stay.  Yet we were told we would have to wait 8 minutes or so to get more than 8 biscuits.  Thought that was crazy and only took the 8.  There were two female employees working at this time.  One was extremely nice and trying to have accommodating customer service.  The other was downright nasty and rude.  When I tried to get her name from her name tag she hid it and went in the back.  I asked the nice gal for her name.  Unfortunately I waited to long to write this review and now can't remember which is which.  One of the employees was Lizbeth and one was Kayla.  Hopefully it is clear to the management which is which."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm a southern belle and my standards for fried chicken are insane

I came across this place and immediately was sold on the idea of fried chicken. When I went in the place was pretty packed, always a good sign! I ordered a two piece combo with the jalapeño poppers and a biscuit. I also decided last minute to throw in some mashed potatoes with gravy. 

The chicken was extremely greasy! I'm talking if I have a hangover the next day and need some grease box food, I will be driving here. The good thing? The Church's here in Canada is exactly the same consisitency in the states. However, the chicken isn't the greatest. The jalapeño poppers were alright however I could see that giving you some bad belly later on. So I stopped at the two poppers. However, the mashed potatoes were not bad. The gravy gave it a little extra oomph and wasn't bad for fast food standards. However, the star for me? Those honey butter biscuits are amazing. Also I should mention I'm a complete biscuit monster. I stole my husbands and I ordered some more. I would come back for the biscuits alone. So those are a must try! 

The place is pretty small for sitting areas so if your lucky to find a spot for eat in, then take it! If not, take out looks like your best bet."}
{"text":"For a not so busy fast food restaurant,  they are constantly out of menu items or you will have to wait at least 10 min for them to prepare your food.  On my final visit, the cashier recognized me and said, \"We always seem to be out of what you want\".  How nice of her to acknowledge my willingness to be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location in Las Vegas! I drive about 20 minutes just to get my food here. Love it and will recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Cheap.  Though my receipt through drive through did not list what I ordered and overcharged me by $2.  Still only paid $20 for 3 pieces of chicken, 7 biscuits, medium baked macaroni & cheese, 2 large mashed potatoes with gravy, x-large Dr. pepper and x-large Strawberry Fanta.  Biscuits are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"I allways come hungry and leave sooooo Happy Thanks to all the employee's , for making me feel welcome, giving me all wonderful smiles. I see they try to make what they can of the small space they got. Kudos to all. I always recommend Churches to my people that come from out of town to visit. And they are never dissatisfied. I will always be back!!"}
{"text":"OK didn't want to cook it was 10pm so thought pick up this to take home yule never go here. Kfc is way better.  This place chicken sucks. All there food sucks."}
{"text":"From 6/10/15
Okay, this was my first time trying Churches Chicken so I will start with the positive.

Pro: Holy wow, their biscuits are delicious! I was not expecting some of the flavors that came off of the biscuits, it was actually sweet- like they had a honey butter drizzle on them. 

Con: The chicken tenders were sort of rubbery, and a bit too salty for my taste.

Pro: The fries were good, fresh, and crispy in a good way.

If I ever come, here again, it will more than likely be for the fries and the biscuits, or maybe I just need to give some of their other chicken meals a try- well see..."}
{"text":"Love church's chicken, this place has the worst customer service. I've been to this location two times last month supposed to open at 10:30 always have an excuse they don't have enough staff to open up usually are always opening a half an hour to an hour when they're supposed to. If I was an owner I would be checking on this location probably losing a lot of customers, and money!"}
{"text":"Don't come here too often but mom was craving their special which was 6 piece shrimp with fries and coleslaw but I substituted the coleslaw for mashed potatoes :-)"}
{"text":"Fries and chicken are obviously refried. The service is horrible. Takes forever at the drive thru. Probably so the poorly trained employees can double fry stuff. Cashier scares the bejesus out of you barking at you and slamming the window open and shut. My fries were tossed into the bag and spilled. Witnessed this barking behavior at the cars in front of me as well so wasn't just me.  I wasn't offered any condiments at all and didn't discover my horrible food until I returned to work to eat and can't return it."}
{"text":"Placed a drive through order and asked for extra sauce since they charged and they said o.k. got it, but they didn't give me any, then just gave me 1 when I said they didn't give me any and then when I asked for more he said he charged for them. Dude that's why I asked for some when I ordered"}
{"text":"Besides the parking lot being empty and the cashier laughing when taking my order, the experience was 'blah'. I had to wait four minutes for a small order of jalapeño cheddar bombers, but they were delicious. Worth the wait, they were savory, juicy, crunchy, and hot."}
{"text":"It is a Church's Chicken. You get what you should expect. Greasy chicken, strawberry soda, and a constant flow of city characters that make us country folks a bit on edge. All in all, this is a great location so long as you do not expect too much."}
{"text":"The manager was rude to his employees at the front counter when we were in. The employees were pleasant with the customers. The place had only four customers in the lobby eating at lunch time. The lobby was filthy. That was the first time we went  there, and we would never go back."}
{"text":"Chicken is good. Price is cheap. Lemon drop biscuits are very nasty. I ordered them to try employee dumped the entire thing of lemon sauce in bag it was terrible!  Customer service could use some help. When I had a question the young girl said yes then the young man said no. No one seem to know what is going on"}
{"text":"I have been patronizing this location for over ten years and during that time their prices have really gone up as well. 

However, they do have some good specials sometimes and if you ever land a coupon that really helps as well.

The quality of the food has gone down a little.  I am not sure if they are using different cooking oil or what but Church's Chicken is not what it used to be back in the day.

But when I want me some greasy chicken and french fries this is the place.

Prices for an individual meal are perfect.  Once you start buying for a family be careful because it adds up quick !

The customer service here is not too bad.  They are hard working.  However, depending on who the manager on duty is at the time dictates the quality of service.

Very small location.  Very busy at times.

Church's Chicken ( This Location ) I'm a fan !"}
{"text":"I love the chicken but the service is really slow!!! It takes 20 minutes to put in an order and another 10 minutes to wait during lunch time. The drive thru is way faster."}
{"text":"The food is good, the customer service is TRASH. All bad, if i could give a zero I would"}
{"text":"Chicken was good and hot. Inexpensive meal, especially w/ coupons."}
{"text":"Sometimes hubby gets a hankering for some ghetto, greasy fried chicken; in the States, Church's was our go to. We were excited to see Church's open up by the Cedarbrae mall. Everything is still brand spanking new. Very helpful and friendly staff. 

Hubby and I split a four piece combo spicy with white meat (upcharged) which comes with a drink and a side, chose the coleslaw. The chicken was hot and juicy, the exterior crunchy but it was more like a slightly greasier version of Louisiana Fried chicken: definitely a different batter used than Stateside. Tried all their dipping sauces and felt that the honey mustard went best. The coleslaw had a nice crunch but was bland. Ordered the mashed potatoes with gravy since the coleslaw disappointed; it was decent and had little pieces of chicken in the gravy. The biscuit with honey butter brushed on top was nice and fluffy with crunchy ridges on top from the caramelized honey butter YUM!

Would come back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad!! Just got home from ordering to go. Rude. Food doesn't taste good. Had to wait for it a bit longer than I should have. Didn't even get all of my order. The guys working we're rude and seemed as though we were bothering them by walking through the door. Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Don't ever come here if you want to be quick about any thing or  have your order taken correctly or even taken at all!!! Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Came through the drive-thru for a quick fix-me-up. I got two pieces of chicken, and they are the best two pieces of fried chicken I have ever had. This place beats KFC, Max's, and Popeye's.

Only kicker is that it costs a little more!"}
{"text":"Love Church's Chicken and this place is the closest one to me.
While I think the best store in town was on Rural and Baseline, this is a strong second. Just got 40 pieces of dark meat and it's awesome as expected!

IT IS NOT CLOSED EITHER."}
{"text":"The food is great and they have amazing specials.  Currently, they have a two biscuit and two dark chicken for $4.99.  I love the spicy chicken and spicy chicken tenders.  The biscuits are amazing and sweet.  I enjoyed the onion rings and jalapeno poppers.

There is room for improvement though. They are slow in cleaning the tables.  You have to ask them to do so.  They don't provide condiments with the fries unless you ask.  The coleslaw and the macaroni salad are just okay.

The food is definitely worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Customer service here leaves a lot to be desired. My mom told the cashier our order and he ignored her and waited for me to tell him the exact same thing. He was very curt and unpleasant with his responses and seemed to be bothered by the fact that he was working. A little girl came in while we waited for our food and told him she wanted the $4.44 deal and he didn't even know what it was until she pointed out the poster on the window that advertised the deal. Then as we were leaving, the girl asked him if she could get her change and he said to her, \"Hold on, okay? I have to get another customer first.\" That's not okay. You shouldn't withhold someone's money regardless of their age. Money has to be dealt with quickly first for obvious reasons. 

The food here has been good though, but I'm not sure I'll be coming back due to customer service alone."}
{"text":"My son begged me for chicken from here, the rudest workers ever! She asked what I wanted told her no lie 7 times and she said Hold Up, what do you want?? I swear on everything. No customer service."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Finger Lickin Good.\" 

This location is always fast and friendly. My experience here has always been walk-in to carry out. It is a busy location but the ladies have it all covered. The restaurant is clean, organized and smells sooooo good. 

Church's for those who don't know is all chicken. Fried Chicken from on the bone to strips. Along with traditional sides such as mash potatoes, fries, fried okra and much more."}
{"text":"So when I feel like cheating and eating something tasty I hit up this location to grab their 99 cent Tacos. Yummy! Worth all the calories. This location is one of the few that still makes them. Fried crispy taco shells with tender juicy marinated chicken topped with lettuce. I don't add the cheese. Great meal deal for lunch. I wish this was not going away. For some reason Church's is taking away the Tacos. 

This location is always clean. The customer service is great and the manager always greats with a smile. I have never dined at this location but I have done to go. There is a walk up ordering or cashiers inside. Many specials for other food items. I have had the chicken and biscuits. Quality service all the time."}
{"text":"The chicken is good, the strips are nice and fresh, but the mac & cheese is just awful.  They started offering a \"baked\" mac&cheese, but it's really just the same crap with a little shredded cheese put in.  They make you ask for tea that if only available behind the counter.  That's not a big deal if it's not busy.  When it is busy, expect to wait and it feels like your bothering them.  I tried the new fish filets as well and lets just say you might want to pass.  This place isn't the cleanest place in the world but the standard chicken is good and not as greasy as say KFC.  The people there have always been very nice and helpful.

*Update* 06-04-2013 :  The so called Texas Chicken was nothing like the advertisement and was just a non-breaded fried half chicken dusted with spices. It was so dry and was something I would never want to get again.  The ads looked so good too."}
{"text":"For a commercially processed meal it's not too bad. I like their spicy greasy chicken from time to time. Their new biscuits are pretty delicious as well. And they're sweet tea hits the spot. Everything else though just doesn't please the senses nor does the dirty tables. I would like to give this place three stars because I will eventually eat churches chicken again but for the 45 minutes that me, my buddy & our kids were dining there no one bothered to clean the joint."}
{"text":"For weeks I had been chicken crazy no pun intended. 

For this fast food restaurant, I wish could leave no stars. This food literally made me sick. It smelt old and, I wish I never took the bite, it even tasted old and overly microwaved. At first I thought it wouldn't be so bad but my gosh I was wrong. 

For weeks, after eatting there, I had a sickening taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Make way for the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. Sorry Bojangles, KFC, and mom. 

Church's is a fast food chain, so there's very little to be said on that front. This particular location is in a food court, so it is even more lacking in a \"location\". That being said, the newly renovated food court is excellent and I love every bit of the design, so no harm there. 

The chicken here ROCKS. The underlying chicken itself is tender and surprisingly juicy - which I like a lot, as other places tend to dry it out - and the breading is absolutely perfect in every way. The breading is outstandingly crunchy and flavorful without being overwhelming or detracting from the juicy chicken. While the usual issues with fried chicken are still present with Church's (too little meat and breading on the bone, a bit pricey, etc)

All in all, a great meal!"}
{"text":"I come here often, sometimes they have it and sometimes they dont. I have never been inside, majority of the time I go thru drive thru. 

It takes a while for the food to come out. Like I said sometimes they have it in stock and sometimes they dont.  I love their jalapeno poppers they actually are better then other places that I go to. The chicken usually isnt greasy its juicy which I love. The set back is their fries typically taste old.

The staff is super friendly and always get our order correct. They really know what they are doing, if they didn't take so much time with the food it would get more stars."}
{"text":"Got the biscuit with honey, it was great!! Although the the honey was not that great :( I also got the apple pie and it was so yummy!!"}
{"text":"I had not had any Church's chicken in roughly ten years when I still lived in Phoenix. All I really could remember was that, at that time, it was dirt cheap chicken.

This outlet is located on the west side of Rainbow Blvd, just north of Windmill Road. I must have driven past here a couple of hundred times before finally giving it a try last night.

 Meh. I've experienced better.

That is truly a good way to sum it up. 

- For all the complaints I see about rudeness or lack of customer service, I did not experience that at all. If anything, the employees were very polite and respectful. I heard lots of \"sirs\" and ma'ams\" as they were helping other patrons.

- Bottom line: the chicken is just too damn greasy! It was downright slimy and slipped around on my plate. Gross. 

All we got was the chicken, so I cannot give an opinion on any of the sides. 

With Popeye's further north on Rainbow and KFC opening very soon right up the road, I just don't think this is a great place to go for your fried chicken fix. 

Unfortunately, I am going to have to consider this a one-and-done experience for me. 

2 stars."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here since I've craved it for so long and because the last time I tried to go here ended up being a super fail attempt..

So why the two stars?

Service was WHACK. I know I'm not coming here to get fine dining service but damn, can a girl get some hot sauce and ketchup? My boyfriend and I came here and got 10pc bucket, some biscuits, and a side of coleslaw. When we had questions while ordering (prices, etc.), all the guy who took our order would do was point to the menu and shake his head. I swear, I did not hear his voice at all until he announced the total price. 

Although we got the order pretty quickly, NOT ONLY did they not ask us if we wanted the chicken original or spicy, they also didn't ask if we wanted condiments, napkins, or even a fork for the coleslaw! They might as well should've left out the top and straw for my drink too! It took us at least 15 minutes to get it. I think these problems could have easily been avoided if there were a station set up already with that stuff, but then again the place is also pretty small.

If those biscuits weren't ON POINT, I would've given this place 1 star. It made me so sad :("}
{"text":"Can't really give a review on the food because they were out of chicken! Went there on a Monday night, not very late, and they had only 1 piece of white meat chicken left, no chicken strips, and a few of the spicy chicken pieces left (we didn't want spicy).

The staff wasn't overly friendly... Not rude, just not real friendly."}
{"text":"This is the worst Churches  Chicken I ever been to. I thought Churches Chicken from the rezervation was bad. This one is bad, no  coleslaw and and NO BISCUITS!! Isn't the Biscuits what makes this place famous..Chicken was ok...Just a poor place to eat. Dont eat there."}
{"text":"Just moved to Chandler, and my first experience here was just fine, so the negative reviews were a little surprising.  The person working the counter was very courteous, and he was happy to accommodate my request for all dark meat.  I watched over and over again how each customer dining in was treated with attentive courtesy.  Chicken, great as always!  Much cleaner than any KFC around, so this is my go-to for fast fried chicken."}
{"text":"Our rule is to never eat at places we can eat at home while on trips so we decide to try Church's Chicken for dinner.

Yes, it's, similar to KFC and also Popeyes.  I prefer KFC, those secret spices make a difference but Church's was maybe better quality.

The chicken was juicy, the biscuit was good even without butter and honey, the corn on the cob was still hot when we got to the hotel."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. Could not believe the ignorance and bliss this place had. The worst service I've ever seen. If I can give negative stars I would. I will never eat here again. I would recommend that you do not too."}
{"text":"I love Church's Chicken, but this location needs to get it together. You would think you would receive a bit faster service going through a drive thru but it took them over 10 minutes to get our food out to yes. Besides giving us warm sweet tea, they never opened the window to let us know why we were waiting so long. I would have appreciated an update. Not sure I'll go through the drive thru at this location."}
{"text":"Cheap. Fresh. Yummy! What more do you want? I wish Church's is closer to home! I always order 4-5 boxes to take home and still taste amazing after a few days! Church's Chicken will always be my pick up when I am in town. It's better than. Popeyes and KFC."}
{"text":"Drive thru person. Was difficult had to repeat the order 4 times . Serve times over  15 mins . Chicken strips were average   portions were for a child  coleslaw was gross . Watered down soda . Just avoid find another churches location"}
{"text":"Ordered the three strip chicken tenders meal.. got the Chicken Chewy meal. Must have sit in the hotbox for hours.. half a teaspoon of gravy on potatoes and NO dipping sauce.. wasn't even asked .. very nasty and a waste of almost $8.00 KFC is right across the street ya'll !!! Don't waste your money here"}
{"text":"Better selection than Popeyes and same great taste, but much cheaper : ) 

I tried the chicken fingers and their sandwich and it was really good. Everything you could ask for. 

It takes about 7 mins per person but you know it's cooked fresh. I love the batter they use."}
{"text":"Quick service, but little customer service. Cleanliness wasn't all that great either. For 5 people, I ordered the 10pc family meal w/an additional side for about $30"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible!!  They recently opened within the last couple months on the lot that used to be Arby's.  They have screwed up mine and two of my co-workers orders the last 3 times we have went.  That's batting 100!  The drive through is slower than molasses and takes a good 15 minutes, even when there is only one car in front of you.  I don't understand how it takes so long to not even make an order right.  I even sat and watched an employee check my bag like 5x so of course, I'd assume it was correct.   And fast food workers want $15/hr?  Yea right!!"}
{"text":"I love Church's fried chicken, but have always wondered why most of the specials and coupons are for dark meat. Our family only eats the white meat and the extra cost for upgrading to white meat makes us drive right by the store. 
The biscuits are terrific. The fries are not very good.
Parking is easy and they have a drive-thru at this location."}
{"text":"I am a fan! They cater to what we needed. Halal Chicken!. Thanks Amjad for being awesome. I think I was served by Taylor who was very polite, helpful and she smiles while serving me. I appreciate it. They have new crews now! My orders were spot on! No incorrect orders. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times but today pulled in to the drive through and was accosted by a bum demanding food. Drove off to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I had to WAIT...when there only were two people ahead of me. Got my food, went home and was shorted 2 items. I called & the guy said he could give me 2 extra biscuits and a family size okra. REALLY??? for wasting my time and gasoline. REALLY??? I did go back the next day and...WAITED & WAITED. This is the crappiest service ever! I occasionally enjoy the food but I will definitely check my order before I leave, IF I go back to that location. These employees have no sense of priority, BIG PERIOD."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst chicken I've eaten.  This chicken is too salty and tastes just like the processed food that we have been counseled not to eat.
The extreme saltiness overpowers the flavor of the chicken. Also, as one of the reviewers mentioned, it's as if they never had a piece of chicken a day in their lives.....let alone know how to cook it.   The chicken was not the nice golden brown color that we expect nor was it crispy.
Save yourself, go to Popeye's!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go to Church's and Popeye's and bring both home and have a taste test. Both had pretty good food, and I really like that I could get fried okra at Church's, but I still have to only give it two stars based on the experience. 

Church's was dirty, the building looked ancient, and it seemed like nothing was upgraded since it opened. There were flies, the door was messed up, and although I didn't notice my husband pointed out that the air conditioning was flawed. That was not the worst problem though. Now before anyone calls me a racist, I have no problem with people who can claim that English is their second language. I do have a problem with someone who can barely speak English, and the English they do speak is impossible to understand. She seemed like a perfectly nice person, but she should be working as a food preparer instead of taking orders. 

I feel the lack of customer service and the ambiance really took away from the experience, and it was not surprising that while Popeye's was doing a rather large lunch business, Church's was empty except for one other customer."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin.  Walked in where 3 employees, one being the manager were on the front line and after standing at the counter for a while I decided to greet them.  The nerve of me to expect to be greeted as a customer.  Who am I? I placed my order and they had to cook mostly everything I ordered. I stood and watched the girl at the drive through take okra that I watched be dropped specifically for me to give to her drive through customer.  The manager said he thought I left.  Seriously??? Lastly I was ran away by the roach crawling on the wall near the register.  I pointed it out to the worker and he smashed it.  No idea where it landed so be aware on your next visit there.  You may find my unhappy ending in your meal because it was very obvious he was not concerned with finding it.  

Yelp, please allow for ZERO ratings."}
{"text":"This is the best Churches ever! Clean, friendly, professional staff who always have a smile for the customer and patience when taking an order or answering questions. Their chicken is excellent, too. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. 
Ask for the creamy jalapeño ranch sauce!
Going to Churches regularly is a spiritual experience."}
{"text":"We came here because they had a higher rating than other Church's Chicken locations. This place ripped us off instead. The cashier was SUPER cool and nice, but the girl in the back messed up our order on purpose. There was a sign on the door saying no fries. Okay fine, we didn't want fries anyway. So we ordered mashed potatoes and Mac n' cheese as our two large sides.  When we got home, our large mash potato container was filled ENTIRELY with gravy!!!! The large sides cost $3.69 EACH! That was enough for me to go back to the store, but other members of the family stopped me. To FILL an entire large container with gravy takes time and the girl knew exactly what she was doing! If you guys didn't have mash potatoes, okay fine! Just tell us! We could get two Mac n' cheese no problem! Geez!"}
{"text":"I guess Church's Chicken is a brand name so you've either made up your mind about that brand, or have yet to try that brand, but for the most part you're going there for the brand name and not a unique experience. On the other hand though, this is an odd one. This used to be Philly Cheese Steak restaurant and it was one of those walk up or drive thru only type of deals that had no dining room. That store went down probably because of it's service. I remember that restaurant had a best Philly Cheese Steak of Las Vegas rating from the Las Vegas Review Journal for like 2 years in a row back in like 2001, 2002 or something like that. Then I remember ordering a a sandwich and waiting 45 freakin' minutes for a freakin turkey cheese steak sandwich and some fries. 45 freakin' minutes in somewhat cold weather because it was just turning into fall and I left the house without a jacket not thinking that it would be so cold, or that I would have to wait 45 freakin' minutes for one sandwich when I was the ONLY ONE standing in front of that place. I actually remember that when I was waiting for my order, a car that was ordering something through the drive thru cursed out one of the employees because he was waiting and it was his lunch break and he was pissed. Needless to say, that place got shut down a few months after. The had a decent sandwich but not worth 45 minutes of waiting... OUTSIDE!    IN LAS VEGAS!!!!! The conditions are never good outside here. It's either too hot, too cold, or windy as hell....It stayed shut down for about 3 years. 
 
   I believe it was somewhere around this time last year when Church's Chicken took over. I don't remember ever going to a Church's Chicken so I figured I'd give it a try. Initially I wanted to dine in but I soon realized that they didn't have a dining room. Either way, I wanted to try it and I walked up to the window. This was around 6-7pm, right in the middle of the night time rush and the window is facing one of the busiest streets in Vegas, Nellis Blvd....PLUS it was windy outside so I basically had to yell my order at the guy three times before he was able to hear what I said and he had to repeat it to me just a many times till he got the #whatever with the beans and extra corn, or whatever I ordered right. 

   As bad as that was, there was already two people that ordered before me. I guess the first person ordered a large order and had to wait a bit for her order. I think she ordered a bucket of something or an office trash can or whatever they put 20 pieces of chicken in. Anyway, both the person after her and eventually my orders came before hers and every time the window would open, that lady would walk up to the window and say \"that's not my order\". Well she was right but they never called her order for pick up in the first place. She did that again with my order and asked where the chicken was ( I ordered some chicken finger meal that all fit in one bag) and once again the guy had to say that it wasn't her order. Again. 

   I already was not liking this place, but I got my order and took it home. I ordered a meal that had the chicken strips, fries, a biscuit and a piece of corn..... The corn was good.... The chicken strips were really dry and all I remember was that NEEDED to eat it with the BBQ sauce and as soon as I ran out I stopped eating the chicken. The fries were garbage. They were this mix of being soggy and hard at the same time. It's as if they fried them and let them sit in the fryer but turned the heat off and just let them sit there. I barely even ate those fries. The biscuit was good though. They have those biscuits with the honey-butter baked into them. I wish I had some extra honey to spread on it instead of butter. The corn was...well it was corn. If they screwed that up then I would have left my house with that corn in my hand, go back to the store and break that window with it but luckily for them it was good. After all, all they had to do was throw it in some boiling water for a while. 

   Overall, I just did not like the place. I know that I didn't get the signature chicken wings that you're supposed to go there for but I still got something they were offering on their menu so either do it good or don't do it at all. There's a KFC, Wing Stop, and a Popeye's all within a block away from this place and any one of those are a better option for your fried chicken needs."}
{"text":"Oh yah, the service here defiantly is awful, they guy took my order for sure has attitude issue, super rude and super impatient, if he dislike his job he should quit."}
{"text":"Church's got expensive! I remember you used to be able to get a 15 pc chicken for like 15 bucks, but now they upped the price. This place though, especially a treat compared to the Church's on Eastway. It seems like the employees here are happier. Don't know what that's all about. This place however, you can easily get hit on randomly by some guy. When I went in here to get my lunch this guy  said to this girl: \"Excuse me, you have a little something on your back\" *pointing at her ass* Oh yeah, real smooth there man. Anyways, I got a little laugh at that.

Anyways, the chicken I thought is always awesome from Church's. I think I like their taste, and dare I say that are a little bit more than Bojangles? I don't know if that's a good idea considering I'm in Bojangles Country. Well, here's my reason though: the chicken and the skin... A lot crispier than Bojo's. I like the seasoning for Church's as well. Of course, this isn't an everyday type of food but every now and again it's good.

This church's is not amazing, but at the same time, it's not bad. I would come here for the laughs and the fast chicken meals. But, next time I'm definitely using coupons because they are some killer deals."}
{"text":"This, food was fresh however we order spicy and I called to tell them of the mistake and Ale the manager would care less of his mistake. He wanted me to drive the food back to the store at 930pm for a replacement instead of issuing a credit for the mistake. Worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"KFC is going to be around the corner pretty soon. I  can't wait til they open. Goodbye Churches.  The employees here are rude and cheap managment."}
{"text":"Good fresh and hot fried chicken. Great new chicken sandwiches Strawberry shortcake should not be missed."}
{"text":"This place sucks! I waited at least ten minutes before placing my order and then I wanted an apple pie and the girl said it was gonna take ten minutes I said okay because I'll probably be waiting in the line for ten minutes, they were busy or stupid i dont know but i understood, then she said it wouldn't be that long so I didn't even want the pie anymore. Turns out I did wait ten minutes before I even got to the window and when I got there I waited at least 5 minutes before even being greeted. When she opened the window the first thing out of her mouth was \"what did you order again?\" At that point I had it and left with NO food. This place is horrible and it is only five minutes away from my house but I will never return to this establishment."}
{"text":"Chicken was good but fries were salty .. ordered via Uber eats .. won't do that any time soon .. foodora service is better"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Church's Chicken. The worst experience terrible food. I ask for chicken tenders got a 2 piece meal. Biscuit I couldn't even bite so hard. The young man at the window rude, then I called to talk to manager he hung up on me.will never try Church's again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the chain and tbh I wasn't really sure what to expect. Albeit, I was pleasantly surprised and quite enjoyed this. I ordered a standard 2 piece spicy chicken meal (thigh and drumstick) with fries and a small gravy (large enough for 2 people).

The coating on the chicken was light and crispy and not greasy, inside the chicken was very moist. The only bad thing is it was under-seasoned compared to its competitors (ie. Popeyes and KFC), but still good nonetheless. They serve crinkle cut fries and these were really good, very crispy on the outside but not overdone. The gravy was also good, slightly peppery and I much prefer it over Popeyes but likely second to KFC. The meal also came with a biscuit which was sweet, buttery and quite moist. This was also surprising in a nice way and I also preferred this over Popeyes biscuit.

Overall this was a very nice fried chicken meal and Churchs will be on my list of options for the future."}
{"text":"I love the fried chicken here.  I've been coming here for years.  19/20 times it was hot, fresh, and juicy.  They make it from scratch everyday.  You can taste the difference between fresh made here and places that use pre-made frozen chicken."}
{"text":"I didn't know Church's had spicy fried chicken, but once I ate it, I was hooked!!!  Forget KFC and popeyes, Church's is where its at!!  Don't even get me started on the biscuits.  Oooooh weee are they good.  Absolutely the best!!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever. Cold food and they combined two separate orders in one large container and acted like they did me a favor. Super uncool!"}
{"text":"Orders wrong again. Food is cold again. Worst chicken spot ever. I got yelp to say this. Good god figure it out."}
{"text":"We didn't go inside but went through the drive thru it seemed like it took them awhile to get us our food. It's not like they're making it fresh for us? All these should've been pre-made and ready all there really is to it is boxing right? I swear they were out chasing the chicken, plucking the feathers, battering it and dropping it in the fryer. Ok so it wasn't quite that long maybe 7-10 mins but it sure seemed like forever in the 110 degree weather 

So the Mac and cheese was partially burnt and hard when I bite into it Bummer.

The honey butter biscuits were over cooked and lacking honey. Must've dried off from being over cooked another bummer.

The struggle is real with these fast food chains. It's always a hit or miss no perfection expected. 

Wasn't worth the calorie gain."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken spot on this side of the tracks! They always have cheap deals on food at this joint. Now they have the 3 tenders 2 sides, a biscuit for 4.44 plus add a drink for a buck. Can't beat it. The lines here can get a little long and they do seem to be a bit slower then other fast food places but there product after all takes longer to cook then at the Golden arches. Just make sure to remind them to put your free jalapeño in your order if you get the above mentioned deal. They are 50 percent on forgetting that with me when I get my order to go! Also the bathrooms are some what clean which is a monumental accomplishment for this neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've always liked Church's fried chicken - however, I haven't eaten fast food fried chicken in years, and this place is not far from where I live and I was listening to my cravings - it said, I want fried chicken.

so, I went.

Honestly, the location is in an area that can draw a sketchy crowd but, I lived in the area for years and I'm used to it.

There were only two people there making the food and I came at a time where it wasn't busy. One car in the drive through, and 3 customers including myself.

The cashier was pleasant. The person in the back may have been a supervisor or manager, he was doing the prepping and cooking. It was a two man show.

The customer service was a pleasant and I was in and out with my meal.

I may come back again in the future when those cravings hit me. Look for another updated review perhaps in the near future!

:]"}
{"text":"Stay away! The chicken isn't worth it and they never give you what you ordered. 

This is my fifth time going to this location, and it's the fifth time my order has been messed up. They seem to always leave things out. This time it was the fries, biscuit, and drink. At this point I'm so sick of correcting  them, or driving back to get it corrected that I've decided to instead drive farther to KFC, where they have necer messed up my order, and the chicken is better. 

If you decide to stop here, make sure you check your order before driving away."}
{"text":"Worst customer service, PERIOD! 
We thought we would try a new highly advertised Smokehouse Chicken. Went to drive through and ordered two orders and some mashed potatoes. 
Tiffany said it would be 16 minutes since they only had one on hand. This was at 5:30 dinner time. So I said OK, I'll wait. 
When the bag was given to me, I took off. 
When I got home, I found that the potatoes weren't there so I called and notified the store. She said that they knew they messed up and took my name and asked me to come back.
Today, only three days later, I returned.
I was greeted by Luis Corona. I explained the situation.
With a crappy attitude, he said \"what's your claim number\". 
\" I didn't get one\", I said. 
\"Did you call?\", he asked
\"Yes, and she took my name\"
He made me wait while he waited on two customers and tried to call the girl who fouled up the order. All this for $3.69. 
I told him that he was making this harder than he had to.
After a stare down that lasted 15 seconds, he opened the register and gave me four bucks with a comment of \"There, I couldn't get through to her to confirm your story.
I told him that \"I felt so blessed by his generosity\" and left never to return."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst church's ever. The employees are rude and seem to care more about socializing with their friends and co workers then take care of the customer. FYI if it wasn't for the customers your rude people wouldn't have a paycheck. You order spicy tenders wait 15 mins and they still give you regular tenders. I have never once gotten spicy tenders like I ordered. It's sad I love church's but this is the closet location. Instead of hiring young punks and all their friends how about hiring people that actually care about their job and the customers. I guess that the owner either doesn't know or doesn't care that these people are costing them money."}
{"text":"This review is not for the food because I never got it, tell you why in a sec. So I have not been to this location in about five years because my last visit the food was horrible. So five years later I give it a try. I place my order and I could tell the clerk was new, he really did not know what he was doing and had to ask for help, no prob I get being new but after standing their for about five minutes waiting for this guy to get the order right, he tells me \"hold on I have to see if we even have any breasts left\". Ok again I get being new but you should already know that especially for the fact I was the only person in line and no one was in the drive thru. Finally he gets it right tells me what I owe and I pull out the debit card, he swipes then says \"Um our register has been having problems so I can't take your card do you have cash\"? I did not but you would think that the cashier would tell me that I have to pay with cash before he wasted my time. I won't be giving this place a third chance."}
{"text":"If they didn't have such good spicy chicken, I wouldn't come here. Every time I have been here, they have run out of spicy chicken and I have to wait 20 minutes. It's 7 pm, expect the dinner crowd."}
{"text":"Slow drive thru ever and the service and food is horrible.  Didn't get anything i asked for and the chicken looked old and tasted bad. never going to this churches again."}
{"text":"Yum! Definition of comfort food.

Ok so I am not a big fan of fast food, and though I looove chicken fingers I am kinda picky about em (no thanks KFC). But Church's is one of those exceptions.Their chicken fingers are awesome because they come in spicy and traditional yay! They are long and covered with yummy crispy batter. On top of that, they have of my all time favorite foods: cheese bombers. Deep fried cheese and jalapeno filled fritters mmm.  Yeah so if your on a diet jus stay far away.

Unfortunately for whatever, reason all the Church's in town (with the exception of rainbow/robindale location) are all extremely run down looking. I don't know why but it seems like the owners do not spend any money on upkeep. Oh well, just pretend it adds to the novelty of the experience."}
{"text":"Slow as hell and no customer service. Ordered and told a long wait for spicy chicken so I said give me the regular chicken. Pay and then told an extended wait for the fries. For a small fast food place they suck balls!"}
{"text":"The general manager Joe is so unprofessional.  I go thru the drive thru and order a #2 with a sprite. The cashier repeats my order and says coke. I say no sprite. I get to the window and again he confirms my order and says coke again! I finally get my food and take off cuz I'm now late getting back to work.  I turn out of the driveway and mash potatoes spill all over my seat!! I asked for fries!!! So I get to work and call the store back I ask for a manager and the guy in the phone says there won't be a manager there until tomorrow afternoon. This was at 2pm by the way. The guy said his name was Joe and he would be in tomorrow. So I go there today at like 12ish and I go inside and wtf Joe is there sayin he remembers me from the phone convo. The odd part his his name tag says General Manager on it!! WTF!! Then instead of replacing my order for the inconvenience I had to go thru, he tries to hand me some burnt ass fries. Then when I say something he gives me attitude saying the only thing wrong with he order was fries!! This place will not be getting any more money from me!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst drive thru places I have been to here in 15  years.  I pulled in to place an order about 5 after 9.  There were no other customers. It took them ten minutes to get my order. They had no chicken breasts, macaroni n cheese. So I adjusted my order n asked for some tea. They basically didn't listen and told me to pull up.  They told me the total I went v to grab change n the cashier couldn't wait 5 seconds to grab a few more pennies and he closed the window  once he decided to reopen the window to take my money I again asked about tea he never answered and didn't give me change right away I stayed another 6 minutes n nobody opened window he opened the window to give me change n shut it so fast I couldn't ask any question. More time passed my food was ready. No beverage so AGAIN I asked could I please have a sweet tea.  Surprise  Surprise no sweet tea. So I asked can I get something else. Hated to bother them and their conversation .  I was not even phased until once home I unpacked dinner for everyone and not only did I only have 7 NOT 8 pieces of chicken they did not included my 4 biscuits and the cheese jalapeno poppers were so overdone their was no cheese left in them.   What a waist of my time and money.  Thank you churches for the lack of service and not even giving me any lube!!! You get 0 STARS from me!!!!!!"}
{"text":"i don't care where you're from or who raised you, I LOVE CHURCHS chicken across the the board anywhere in the United States. And trust me, I have moved from california to indiana to west palm beach to chicago, and even if we visit pensacola, we always eat church's chicken. always!"}
{"text":"So I pull up to the drive thru at 9:56pm, they close at 10:30pm. The middle eastern or Indian guy says he has no more chicken and itll take 15 minutes to make more. I said OK ill wait. Let me get a 3 piece chicken, then cuts me off and says I cant turn on my fryer for a 3 pc, u have to get a 10 peice. WHAT? they r supposed to be open for another 34 mins! He then offers me a soda \"on the house\" so I asked for a large diet and he says No, I was going to give you a small soda. Then gives me a kids cup or free water cup of diet coke! THIS IS THE WORST church's chicken ive ever been to."}
{"text":"Worse chicken i ever eat!!! I got sick with food poisoning, i got the special of $15 with a half of galon of sweet ice t, i end it up in the hospital, I suggest people , spend a litle more but eat better, I DONT EVER COMEBACK!!"}
{"text":"I love The Church! This is the only chicken spot of the big three that does not give me bubble gut itus. There has to be something in the batter with Popeyes and the colonel that has me wishing for death soon after eating their chicken. Church's so far has been friendly with my bowels. Fantastik!!!

I love their chicken, but I am forced to endure the constant disappointment with the service at this Church's Chicken.  It must have been a chore for the chicken technician to get some hot sauce the couple of times I asked for it.  Today I got my regular 2 piece and a biscuit w/ HOT SAUCE... I hurry home with the thoughts of Church's Chicken being devoured by my being with the essence of Louisiana hot sauce being inhaled through my nostrils. SHE THREW IN KETCHUP!!! CHEESE 'N RICE!!!"}
{"text":"I keep driving by this location and seeing an advertisement for the $5 deal. So I finally made the decision to stop and get it. The $5 deal comes with two pieces of chicken or three tenders, biscuits, jalapeño bombers, and two sides of your choice. I asked for the corn nuggets and extra jalapeño bombers. My husband ordered 14 tenders. We get home and I didn't get my extra jalapeño bombers and there was a hair on one of my hubby's chicken tenders.   I promise it's not our hair! It was wrapped around! ? not coming back."}
{"text":"Always friendly & great service. It's does take a while to get the food but I'm always there during busy times (after work) so it's expected. My family likes the crispy chicken not soggy or dry. Biscuits are really good. Main side fav poppers, fried okra, mashed potatoes.Don't forget to ask for hot sauce and ketchup."}
{"text":"Hated it. I accept a certain degree of responsibility for choosing to go here since I never liked Church's. The chicken always seemed pretty flavorless and as a child my sister pronounced it \"hairy\", meaning it was the cheap crap that underwent careless processing so some of the pinfeathers were left intact. Hadn't been to one in years. 

When they opened one near me, I was absolutely not tempted by the flyers advertising specials involving dark meat and sweet tea. Yuk. I am not the demographic they're going for.

BUT. I was on my way home from grocery shopping, it was almost dinner time, and no way was I going to cook the same day I shopped. I actually had dinner plans with friends, so when I passed Church's on the way home, a faint pulse of guilt caused me to turn in to grab some dinner for the Anaconda. (He has been known to happily chomp away on many things I find distasteful; the fact that it might be either \"flavorless\" or \"hairy\" wouldn't slow his roll at all).

Well, considering the fact that I was tired from running errands and in a bit of a hurry, this was the worst mistake of my life. Once I got into the line, I was trapped, and it was NOT moving. After 18 minutes (I timed it), I was finally at the ordering station. No sign of life. So I honked and said \"Excuse me, is anyone there?\", to which I received an exasperated \"Just a minute!\"
So I waited 10, and then called to her again. \"I SAID just a minute!!!\" No apology, no explanation, no civility at all. I assume she eventually came back to (snottily) take my order, but when the traffic crawled forward, I went with it, and when I got towards the front, I had the people waiting in front of me pull up so I could just leave.                                                       

30 minutes of my day and all I got was a brush with high blood pressure. I'm sure they were overwhelmed with the crowd, No one could have expected there were that many people craving feathery chicken legs all at once. But I put this squarely on management for not organizing the flow and making sure employees were at least trying to give basic customer service. Was it a one time mess up? I have no idea. I never went there again an I never will.

Good day, sir!"}
{"text":"So I've gone to this location several times, I pretty much always get the 5 piece chicken special for 5 bucks, and it's always fresh and juicy. It's very very greasy and salty, but then again, it is fried chicken. I've always been helped quickly and the staff has always been courteous to me, but I have seen so upset customers here as well. It seems they treat you how you treat them, so it doesn't ever seem to affect me. This location is also in a tough neighborhood, so who knows what happened. One thing that's a bit odd, the drive thru has a very odd configuration, and has a very tight turn so if you can't drive, just park and go inside. There is a lot of multicolored paint on the drive thru railings, so many people have obviously had trouble with it. Just a friendly warning."}
{"text":"Ok, So went to this location last night. Oct. 20,2015, dropped $30 bucks on some chicken , get my order-then ask for honey. Guy gives me 4 packets of honey. Wow, slow down 4 packets for 14 piece $30 dollar meal. Went home thinking which of my 14 pieces of chicken gets honey drizzled on it. Guy tells me there out of honey. So, I am wondering why my 4 packets are chilled from the refrigerator. Ah, ha!! Maybe there chilled because your not out of honey and your being a Jew about my honey that I asked for... 14 piece $30 dollar meal can I get a dozen packets of honey. No, honey for my biscuits. REALLY......."}
{"text":"not sure if i was eating a fried chicken or a card board box. the damn food was dryer than the Arizona desert!! never coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try this for the first time. 
Big mistake. 
Drive through lady was super rude.
Took 15 minutes to get my order.
Then she gave me my bag and the fries were dumped all over my bag. ( I'll be including the picture) 
The food was okay. 
Wasn't expecting a lot, the food is what I expected. The service was worse than any fast food ever.
This place would succeed if hey had better employees."}
{"text":"When I don't feel like cooking dinner I like to come here and buy some chicken and biscuits. I go to this churchs because it's the closest one to me. The chicken is delicious I like dark meat so it's always legs and thighs that I like to order here. The biscuits are super yummy!!! My kids love them!!! They have honey on the top and are a little crunchy on the top as well but super moist on the bottom. They're the best biscuits! Way better than KFC.

The only reason I gave it a 4 stars is because sometimes if I go too late at night and order a ten piece chicken, they give me mostly thighs and like 3 legs and don't tell me. So now I've learned my lesson, I'll check my order before I leave. One time they did let me know before handing it to me so I was good, as long as I have one leg for each of my kids then I don't mind. Lol... Anyhow other than that you must try if you are a chicken lover like myself!!!;)"}
{"text":"A lot of very efficient young people handling the place and doing to great job of it. Food was hot and fresh. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I haven't had Church's chicken in forever and was very pleasantly surprised by how good it was (again). Church's seems quite similar to Popeye's but I found things were certainly distinct between them. The chicken is less salty, the rolls are mildly sweet, and the mashed and gravy is less tangy. All very, very good.

This location served me super fast with fresh tasty food. I'll be having more Church's much sooner than a couple of decades!"}
{"text":"Having Church's again! The chicken was pretty good again as was the okra. This location is pretty small but good for takeout. One of my items was missing from my family combo. It wasn't something I even wanted (jalapenos) but it was included and shouldn't have been overlooked."}
{"text":"I was going to give a lower rating for incredibly slow service. I mean REALLY slow. 8:30 pm (so beyond the traditional dinner rush) and there was a lineup inside and at the drive-thru. It had to be at least 10 minutes through the drive-thru and I was third in line.

But the freshness of the meal was their redemption. It really was very good. Hopefully it was just they were short-staffed on this occasion and the slowness isn't a regular thing here. But the food's good so no worries there!"}
{"text":"This Church's location is awesome. Been here several times and have had great prompt service. On this occasion I was helped by a nice guy named Uriel. His customer service was top notch. Thanks, Uriel!"}

A side of Cole slaw and mashed potatoes.
Service very fast. These ladies work very
hard........
This is the BEST chicken..........
Better than others brands hands down........
Highly recommended **********"}
{"text":"Not bad but door was open about 5 mins before open not much ready wonder what was going on during opening procedures sitting at our table waiting soda nozzles not on but soaking in a tin next to machine service seemed ok not over the top but what you'd expect I would think the full menu would be a available at open but guess not I would recommend coming later in the day if you want the best or a full menu."}
{"text":"If I could give churches at this location zero stars I would. Stopped at 6:30 PM and they had no spicy white chicken available.What really pisses me off is they weren't even going to make anymore tonight. Will good customer service."}
{"text":"Drive thru is painfully slow still.  And the speaker system where your order is still hard to hear because of all the static.  After you order and pull up to the window it took about 8 minutes or so for me to get the food.  I will say I love eating the food every once in awhile.  Lucky I was the only one in line"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for for the honey biscuits. I was disappointed to find out when we got to the drive thru that they were out, but we ordered anyway.

I got the lemon battered shrimp and fries. My friend got the chicken tenders, mash potatoes, and coleslaw. The six shrimp were very small and about 50% shell tail. The batter on them was tasty but too salty. The fries were okay. My friend said the chicken tenders were blah. Also we got this food on a Friday night. The coleslaw was dated Sunday 10 am. Was that when it was made or when it should be thrown out? The replacement rolls reminded me of an elementary school lunch. Fortunately they aren't on the menu.

The guy working the drive thru was polite and seemed to be in a good mood. You would think that is not with mentioning but I've seen so many people working with the public that seem miserable. He earned the business a second star."}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 piece meal togo.  Specifically requested one of the pieces to be a chicken breast.  When I got home, discovered that we got a thigh,  leg and wing....they still haven't hired competent employees.  I'll probably will not return until they hire /train the employees, which I doubt, so I won't return."}
{"text":"Over 30 years ago as a manager Church's Chicken this store needs a lot of help . This is not the first time I visited the place. I decided to give him another chance first time I went there I ordered an all white meal they said only came in mixed which was kind of funny cuz I said they used to sell all white. But the chicken at least freshly cooked with a little wait this time I went in order the three piece all white meal and the chicken must have been up there for hours except for maybe the wing the first breast was way over its 45-minute holding time the wing must have been right around the 45-minute holding time probably a little over and the last breast I ate was drier than hell and had to be on that rack for over 2 hours both breasts should not have been sold and the wing was borderline. And I went to the drive-thru at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Worst place on earth when the older female (manger/owner not sure )when she is not there. 

When she is there you get everything fast and you get what is advertised. The place is clean !!!

When she is not there it's like another world !!
Rude staff!!!
Dirty!!!
The signs say 2 side with your order they tell you can only have one and there is nothing you can do about it. 

That if the two girls in the back ever stop talking long enough to wait on you!!!

God for bid you want a dipping sauce and they have to quit talking again to do there job. 

So be warned .........."}
{"text":"The chicken nuggets bought today are all soft. I buy many times. Today is the worst and I'm not happy."}
{"text":"Darned good chicken! 

Unlike a previous reviewer I've had nothing but good experiences at Church's Chicken here in Mesa. When it gets too late to go anyplace else and I need something to eat Church's is close and easy and fast and cheap. Not only that but it tastes good. I usually prefer dark meat but sometimes I forget to tell them and get white meat, either way it's extremely moist and tender and juicy.  I've never gotten a bad batch with an unacceptable coating or meat. 

The biscuits are so good I want to eat them like cookies! I've gotten a half gallon of the sweet tea for 2 bucks on sale in hot weather and it lasted me several days in my motel room.  I tried the Apple Turnover once and it was very good. This trip I've gotten the $2.99 special two different times that has a biscuit with 2 pieces of chicken, usually a thigh and leg but today I got a thigh and a breast.  It's a fast easy meal if it's too late to go to a restaurant and it keeps well in the motel fridge too. On past trips I've  sometimes stopped by and gotten 3 or 4 pieces just to keep in the refrigerator so that if I don't feel like going out to eat I've got something on hand.  

Oh, and I went to Popeyes a few weeks ago expecting to get a good fried chicken and it was so horribly salty I couldn't eat it. Church's Chicken has never let me down.  Even the mashed potatoes and gravy weren't bad. They certainly weren't  overly salty even though I know they were made from a mix.

Now if I could just get Church's Chicken to open one near where I live in San Diego....."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly very good!  I went in with negative expectations, but the chicken was crisp outside, not overly salty, plump and dripping with juices on the inside.  The coleslaw was crisp and fresh with a good balance of ingredients, the biscuits were crutchy on the outside and moist as white cake on the inside.  The service was cheerful, friendly and helpful.  I have no complaints."}
{"text":"The wings are ginormous!

We love Church's, wish they had more here in the Valley.  I love the spicy, we get the huge wings only ( oh, there not called huge wings)  I have know idea, where they get chicken with wings like these.  I usually can't even eat both of them in the 2 piece meal. Yes, they will charge you a little more for 2 wings or all wings, WHAT EVER!  It's worth it."}
{"text":"I love Church's I wish there were more of them in town.  It took a little longer than what I'm use to (comparing it to another location) but it was awesome, it was hot, like it just came out of the fryer, the corn on the cobb was hot until the last bite.  
This Churches, is small, and the tables are really close to each other, but other than that, no need in sweeting the small stuff, if everything else is awesome."}
{"text":"Came at 10:00. They close at 10:30, and said they ran out of chicken. Went to Popeyes instead."}
{"text":"Food was good. Drive thru was horrible. My second time coming and literally waited 30 minutes in the drive thru, all I ordered was a 5 piece meal. I felt bad for the cars behind me, they were going to wait even longer. Employee didn't even apologize for the wait and kept talking on the headset while I tried to ask for condiments. Not good service at all."}
{"text":"Horrible service horrible service horrible service horrible service horrible horrible DID I MENTION HORRIBLE. they didn't get our order correct after sitting in line for 20 minutes. Then the guy at the window wants to make jokes ! Just get my food please. Food isn't even good for the prices and half as cooked."}

Yes, its a chain, but hey, I'm a Fan....Don't Judge! On our way to church, we wanted something fast and quick, so we thought Church's would do the trick. We step inside and there's a wait time like you couldn't imagine!

People were ordering by the 50 and 70 pieces, and we were only looking to try this for the first time! People were waiting for their order inside and in the drive thru too!
as we stood in line, we could see the ladies dredging chicken in the seasoned flour trying to keep up with the demand. When it came time for us to order. We were told that it was gonna be about a 15-20 minutes for a fresh batch. Nooooooooo!!!!

We were pressed for time and thank goodness while we were contemplating our decision a worker pulls out a hot tray of biscuits and glazes them with honey, and about 30 seconds later, a fresh batch of fried chicken arrives! \"Legs and thighs okay?\"
the lady asks...\"Perfect!\" we reply, so we both get a two piece meal with some sweet tea and we were set...Crunchy, Juicy, and more finger lickin' good than the colonel's secret recipe, we enjoyed every single bite huffing and puffing from all of that hot, steamy, juicy goodness! The biscuits are some of the softest and tastiest you'll ever sink your teeth into, but the mashed potatoes are instant, so nothing special about those...

Prices are very reasonable, and the taste will definitely bring me back the next time a craving hits!  ALOHA!!!

When in Chinatown, grab Asian food right? Ummmm....how's about some Church's?....as in Church's Fried Chicken?!?!? Yup, why not???

Having only recently discovered Church's, We stopped by this location to see if it was just as good as our last visit at another location. Got a 2 piece original meal with 2 sides and a drink for $5.99...Not bad for a chicken chain! You would have definitely spent double the amount at a soul food joint.

We had two different people help us, and they were both very courteous and helpful regardless of how slammed they were at the moment inside the restaurant AND drive thru! Church's always has a wait for fried chicken, and it was a 15 minute wait this time. I've never seen it this busy at Popeye's, Jolibee, or even at  Colonel Sanders' place! Always crispy, hot, and juicy, their chicken doesn't disappoint and neither do the biscuits...can't get softer, fluffy biscuits anywhere else...sides are okay but its all about the chicken, biscuits, and sweet tea here! 

Next time you're in Chinatown and not feelin' Chinesey, Japanesey, Vietnamesey, or any other type of Asian persuasion, Go get yourself some fried chicken goodness from Church's!

 ALOHA!!!

Does Corporate pay attention?
First time ordering at this store...gave me cold 
chicken tenders instead of 3 piece dark meat that I ordered...and my order was repeated back to me 3 times...I see 1.5 stars for a rating...but I succumbed anyway with hope....I dont know why here in Surprise our fast food restaurants can't step it up....Food is expensive now, 10 dollars for a meal so my expectations should be high!!! Also it's not like you can just turn around and go back as most people lives few miles or more away...Raj is the manager...I left my number...let's see if she calls back! Corporate wake up...Yelp is relevant, even here in Surprise!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken here. The skin is so crispy and the flavor is spot on. The chicken is super juicy. I love that they have spicy chicken or original as options and you can divide your order up. The spicy chicken is spicy enough I wish it was spicier but I guess they make it so everyone can eat it. 

The sides were ok. The mash potatoes were creamy but the flavors were just ok. I wish there was more gravy with the mash. The mac and cheese is gross. It was bland and the noodles were overcooked. The biscuits are good if you like sweet biscuits. They have a hard, candied-like honey flavored crust on the outside. Over all, I would say the KFC's sides are way better. 

The girl that took my order today was really nice and super quick."}
{"text":"Church's Spicy chicken is one of my favorite around the neighborhood and their biscuits are also very tasty. But sometimes when you get here, they might run out of this or that, so you'll have to wait for 10-15min. That's the downside but if it's fresh, you'll not regret coming here."}
{"text":"This location is the closest one to my old shop. 12-15 years ago, after multiple messed up orders and not finding anybody on staff that spoke enough English to fix the orders, I stopped going here.  Recently I was driving down the street and saw the sign and decided chicken was what I wanted for lunch.  The order came out correct, The staff spoke English and service was pleasant."}
{"text":"I am surprised I have never reviewed this place.  It is not a frequent stop, maybe twice a year.  I think I prefer the spices in KFC but Church's comes without all the grease.  

This stop last Saturday about 12:30 I was second in line that turned in to about a dozen people and they had maybe six pieces of chicken in the serving trays so we all got to hang out for a while waiting for the chicken."}
{"text":"CHEAP. CRUNCHY. CHICKEN.

the triple C threat.

Church's chicken is the closest I'll get to being religious and this will be the only church i will voluntarily go to even tho all i do here is sin and pig out. I honestly think you could blind fold a food critic, feed them Church's chicken, and they might think it was cooked by Jose Andres. They might also think I'm being a little dramatic. 

Keep an eye out for their posters to see what special deals they have going on! Last time I was here I got two sides, a biscuit, and two pieces of chicken for $4.44 I believe? DANK.

Oh, and their biscuits will probably make you drool enough to cure the California drought.

The line may be long and move kinda slowly but that's because right when you order, they will give you your food before helping the next customer in line. 

Even if you don't come here, I'd advise rolling down your window as you drive passed it and inhale the deep fried fumes.


GARrgGLLGRLrgLRrrGG so god so good. Shame on you if you think weenie KFC chicken is better."}
{"text":"I walked in the store to grab dinner.  I had not had my fried chicken fix in awhile.  I have a coupon for 10 chicken tenders with 2 sides.  Then I got a call from my husband that he wanted fried chicken not the tenders, so since I already placed my order I had to order a family dinner with sides and the honey butter biscuits.  

The staff was friendly and funny.  A dine-in customer question why is the chicken breast so small.  The girls said yes that is the size of our breast, our wings are normal huge compare to the other stores (KFC).  Then all 3 of us locked eyes and laughed.  The staff said I just said my breast is small.  LOL!!!  

The fried chicken was good, crispy (both tenders and original).  The corn on the cob was just buttery and no flavor.  The mash potatoes were ok.  The honey butter biscuits were yumtastic!  I know, I think my heart stopped beating for a few mins after the my meal."}
{"text":"I grade fast food places on a curve. I'm always amazed at the 1STAR revenge reviews by people who didn't get the correct sauce packet or who waited too long for thier order . Really people? Two suggestions: 1) work at a fast food place yourself for 90 days; it will open your eyes, you South Park Yelpers 2) write your congressman and insist on a $15 per hour minimum wage. Once our selfish corporate overlords have to pay a living wage, they will replace their disposable worker approach and focus on training and developing their valuable staff. 

Sorry 'bout that  LOL

Went here at lunch. The English-is-my-second-language 40-something staff were friendly and efficient.  I got my order fast. The 50 cent \"hot wings\" were crunchy outside,  tender, juicy inside and tasty, with a mild to medium heat. These are not a sauced wing! Just a spiced batter deep fried, good sized wing at a super cheap price. The cole slaw was sweet with a bit a tang and plenty of satisfying crunch.

The facility is worn and dingy. The small dining area was messy and needed cleaning.  The windows havent been washed recently. Typical of Church's in this city. I don't care. I've eaten at many a food cart on side streets in Tijuana. And here we have Health Inspectors."}
{"text":"I got to the drive thru at 8:50pm.  The employee says please wait on the speaker.  10 minutes pass and the cars are lining up behind me.  Finally, I hear a woman's voice say \"Welcome to McDonald's.  May I take your order?\".  I was a little irritated by now so in a not too friendly voice I said \"This is not McDonald's\"  She said sorry. Was she sorry I did not go to McDonald's or that she has no idea where she is working?  I attempted to order the lemon shrimp dinner with a medium diet coke.  She could not get the order straight.  She finally just quit talking so I drove to the pickup window.  A male employee said.  \"She works a second job\"  Gee, I wonder where that could be?  I said she doesn't know the menu either.  He asked me what I ordered and I could see he was changing whatever Ms. McDonald's had entered.  I paid and he closed the window.  I waited and I waited and I waited.  He was doing the orders on the speaker, filling orders and working the pick up window while Ms. McDonald's just stood there laughing.  I finally got my food 25 minutes later.  He opened the window and said \"Sorry.  Some people just can't decide what they want\".  By now there was only 1 car behind me as everyone else had left.  Did I mention this was my first visit to Church's?   Not a good first impression."}

Smushed bun, small chicken patty with mayonnaise and a few bits of shredded lettuce. I ate it in 5 bites. For what I paid for, this is not worth the price. I would expect something like this from the McDonald's dollar menu, not from an actual meal. Also, the service was UNBELIEVABLY slow. It took close to 15 minutes to receive our order from the time we ordered our food. It wasn't even busy. There were no patrons inside, and only three vehicles at the drive thru, including us. They also forgot the mashed potatoes we ordered, thankfully we were paying attention so we could notify them. The whole experience was a huge disappointment.

Numerous tries before they closed at 10pm but to no avail and no receipt.  The same people want $15 and my order is wrong and not FRESH!!!!  Cmon people this is a low skill job not rocket science.

{"text":"I am a first time   Eater at churches. I walked in and everybody turned around behind the counter and looked at me and didn't say anything. I waited there for about five minutes for somebody to even say something to me. When a group of black people walked in after me they were like hey what's up welcome to churches. I am a white female. Two more parties of black people walk in after me. They said something to each of those parties each! I've been ordered the three-piece with two sides now. He didn't bring it up wrong and I asked her mashed potatoes no gravy he clearly saw that there was gravy on - potatoes and still put it in the bag. So then I had to pull it out and give it back to him to make a point of him to give me the right things that I ordered. I will never ever ever going to that church is taking again because of the racism that I felt was there and it the horrible fucking service. I've been asked for Honey he just told me that there was no honey left so I just walked out he never gave me a receipt and I will never go back.

I'm assuming it was the manager had his pants sagged so much you can see his sweaty marks in his undwrwear. I'll definitely be contacting Corp because if that's the manager there's a huge problem. It's weird they are so slow because all the food is already made."}
{"text":"The food is Sooooooooooooo good. I can't stress that enough. The chicks. Is crispy and juicy....perfectly seasoned! The macaroni was so creamy and buttery. Those biscuits though! Man!

I feel like their employees aren't thoroughly trained or something because every time I come here there's always an issue with orders. & one time they gave me this gross chicken strip which was not fried all the way and was still pink and well, lets just say it didnt look like a chicken strip at all. I love Church's on Spring Mountain, I've never had a problem with that one. I think I'll just stick that location."}
{"text":"The only church I've ever attended.... and one of my guilty pleasures.

Fuck KFC. As the urban legend goes, they don't call it Kentucky Fried Chicken anymore because the freakazoid genetically engineered birds they use aren't chickens anymore.

Church's Chicken is where it's at. Their chicken is about 76435987435x  better than KFC. 

Delicious. Crispy. The spicy version is even better. 

They have fried okra as a side! Fast food joint that serves okra. How can you go wrong? The family size okra is about a pint and a half. Think of them as the Church's Chicken holy sacrament.

Their biscuits are perfect. Ask for honey. OK it's not really all honey, but at least honey is one of the ingredients. It doesn't matter. Ask for a handful of their hot sauce packets too, which are kick freaking butt. My only complaint is that they don't have greens on their menu anymore. So long as the okra is still there, so am I motherfucker. Don't miss the mac n cheese, either. It goes great with the hotsauce.

I just noticed this ghetto-ass location, which I can get to in about 3 minutes by heading down Grand Ave as kind of a short cut.  My arteries are cursing me, but my belly is thanking me.

Writing this review made me hungry. I'm going to go go make a donation to the Church right now. If you want Church's late at night I recommend you bring a sidearm (this is Arizona! Yee haw!) or try another location. Any other time it's perfectly safe. I'm not talking about protecting yourself from the neighborhood 7th ave/grand ave/van buren crackheads and pimps, either... I'm referring to the idiot hipsters who frequent the art galleries on that part of Grand. They are too pretentious to eat this heavenly ambrosia known as Church's Chicken. You might just wanna get with the vibe of that 'hood and pop a cap in one these dopes who would rather go waste their daddy's ducats at that shithole known as Fate over at Roosevelt and 3rd, just on principle."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick bite.................................yeah that's all I guess"}
{"text":"At first I was annoyed. The male worker taking my order took to long to get it down and made me feel like it was his first day. He repeated it a few times, which is fine with me, it ensures a correct order. Than the wait. As this was my first visit here I thought this might be my last. I waited about 6mins. 

But when I got home, my food was delicious and correct! It was freshly made, which explained the longer wait. The fries were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. So good! Being that I'm a Fry snob. The 4 chicken tenders were crispy and just right amount of spicy. The inside was nice and tender too! The biscuit was extra honey, which is one thing I love about Church's...and also the reason I stay away. Its hard to stop at just one. 

I'll take the long wait if it means that I get fresh, hot food!"}
{"text":"Longest wait evvvverrrr. Seriously. So so long. The chicken is okay but sometimes it's undercooked."}
{"text":"I've been going out of my way to go to Church's lately rather than KFC because Church's doesn't tend to make me sick. Which is great. 

This isn't really a good location to sit-down at but for anything to-go I am always treated well and the prices are good. If they are out of something and I have to wait, they will usually hook me up with a soda or some extra biscuits for the wait without even having to ask, which is something most places just don't have the sense of service to do anymore.

Lost a star because the place could be cleaner, but it's not that bad.

Give them a try instead of KFC next time!"}
{"text":"What I love most about this place is their biscuits and cheap prices. Biscuits are the best I've had, crispy sweet top with a soft inside, soooo good. Chicken has a very crispy crust. I got the 5 piece with two biscuits for only $5... Such a deal for two people."}
{"text":"Typical chicken. Service was not so great and the spacing to sit in here is very small.

Location is great but pulling in and pulling out is so hard due to Spring Mnt road being so busy."}
{"text":"Went into this location 5 days ago and ordered 28.00 family meal and  gave the cashier 40.00 got change and waited 10 minutes for her tell me that they are out of regular chicken. They only have spicy. I asked how long before next batch of regular chicken is done. She replied there was more at 745 on a Friday?????? So my hubby starts growling for refund. To get rid of us  she gave me a full 40.00 refund.... so yes i made money on the trip thats worth the star. Other than  that will opt for other location to eat"}
{"text":"I love their chicken, that's why I'll give them a star. Horrible service. I waited for about 45 minutes until I was helped in the drive through. There were only five cars and I had to wait around 20 minutes to finally get my order taken and some girl said, give me a sec and I said that's fine. 20 minutes later again, I waited, there was no cars in front of me. I was so angry I just drove to their window and finally they took my order. Can't believe how rude they were. She didn't even say sorry and that's all I wanted was an apology. Best believe, I will never be coming back."}
{"text":"I was definitely stoked to try Church's. It's the closest chicken place to our house here in Vegas and I was hoping it would be great. 

It's your typical drive-through with far too many options on the menu. There was some bucket deal running, but my husband wanted strips, so we didn't opt for it. The chicken is fried, crispy and very moist. The flavors are delightful and it wasn't very greasy. I got a side of fried okra with mine and the serving was enormous. The okra was perfectly fried, not dried out - and made my mouth happy. :) 

My husband wasn't a huge fan - but he's super picky :)"}
{"text":"Ordered 24 pieces of chicken strips. The process of making chicken strips is too damn easy to complain about. A worker yells while I'm in the lobby, \"hurry up! Some f**ker ordered all these chicken strips.\" 

Sorry if that's too damn hard for you. Considering the fact that you're at least 30, you should acquire some skills other than making chicken at a fast food joint. 

Thanks. No thanks.

Oh, but thanks to the cashier who gave me some free drinks. You're cool."}
{"text":"This place is very slow.  No one's knows what they are doing. Chicken overcooked,  didn't have wings.  Order was completely wrong when I got back to the office"}
{"text":"There is no possible way that their chicken is better than Popeye's....or even KFC.  They once were contenders in my book before, but Church's fell waaaaaaaaaay off.  Too much grease on the inside of the pieces...even came across some fat blobs...not appealing at all.  In addition to this, the chicken pieces were cold - like they didn't get cooked all the way.
Biscuits and bombers were good while they were hot - great to snack on during the drive home.  That was about it.
I'm pretty sure I won't be coming back here again - at least not for chicken."}
{"text":"I really like their chicken and biscuits in my opinion and they're still good as ever."}
{"text":"Well, I typically don't eat fast food chicken that often but my wife and I ordered some chicken pieces and strips and I have to say they were good.

We had spicy and original recipe for both and what I liked is how crispy the chicken really was. It was moist, crispy and had great flavor.

Nicely Done"}
{"text":"We stopped on one night on vacation .They were very helpful with my order and made suggestions.The food was cooked to profection and very flavorful. The chicken was moist on the inside and crispy outside. The staff working we're doing great job . They processed orders fast and we're very organized.We ate dinner and had extra we took back to the hotel. The best part was chicken for breakfast. Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"I came by this location right before closing time to order a bunch of fried chicken for my friends.  They were out of a lot of stuff, but the guy was nice enough to throw in what he could.  Chicken was delicious, though.  Worth the drive over the KFC that was around the corner."}
{"text":"Depending on the day of the week and the time, you will have a long wait for chicken. Most recent visit 6/7/15 around 9pm- we went through the drive thru, 4 cars ahead of us and we waited about 5 minutes just to order, we ordered a 15 piece meal deal and waited another 7 minutes to get to the window- just to be told that the chicken would be ready in 15-20 minutes more and if we wanted to wait?! I was like, \"What?\" I asked the young man if he was serious? If we had to wait an additional 15 minutes after we had already been in line for about 12 minutes and he just looked at me and said \"yeah\". 
We decided to wait since we weren't about to go home and cook at 9pm. A 2nd young man asked us to pull forward after we paid and offered us a free beverage while we waited which we gladly accepted. Total wait after that contact was 20 minutes. Chicken was hot and yummy.  
But I can't figure out why they didn't tell us when we ordered that there wasn't any chicken ready and cooking time took 15 minutes more? 2 of the drivers in front of us just pulled out when they got up to the window to pay. 
Now this isn't the first time this has happened; it actually has happened at least 4 times inside as well. 
The food is usually good here, inside cleanliness varies on time of day and how busy they have been. Some of the employees are friendly, but many of the employees seem to be young teens and some aren't too worried about how their customer service."}
{"text":"The deals here are impressive, that is for sure. Very cheap. 

The chicken is tasty. And so are the biscuits, which no healthy human should be consuming, but what the hell -- one has to splurge sometimes, I suppose. 

And this area does not offer much for fast food options with chicken as the primary focus (Cane's nearby, Farm Basket far away, and BFG/Strip N Dip even farther away), or anything really at Church's price-point. 

Stuff like a shrimp basket with french fries for 3.59$, the so-called \"Big Tex\" for 2.49$, and biscuits for 50¢ ea.; manager's special of five chicken strips and two biscuits for 5$; et al.

So, why the two stars, E? 

I do not know: I have experienced better. It is a really dirty restaurant. 

I have seen \"animals\" that should be \"restricted\" scurrying about. I have also been to New York City, so it does not make it prohibitive or forbidden to me, but for fuck's sake ....

On the latest SNHD inspection (http://www.southernnevadahealthdistrict.org/restaurants/inspections.php), they are rocking the infamous Violation 16, which is exactly what my star deductions are based on ... for those unfamiliar (\"pest control\"). 

SNHD still inexplicably permits them, as well as other eateries, to maintain an \"A\" grade even with the suspect V-16. 

Something to keep in mind for those that believe the giant black \"A\" on the piece of white paper comes with a level of certainty that fuckery like this will not be afoot. - E"}
{"text":"The chicken is good. This place has gone downhill since my first review.
Sadly, the same surly, unfriendly people still work here. The ONE friendly person that worked here on my first review has since left. The biscuits are now always too dark (which means overcooked and therefore dry) and when you say something, they say it's within their approved color range. What the heck??...then FIX your friggin color chart, these are dry and sucky!
Tonight Surly-unfriendly-girl didn't even ask us if we wanted any of our pieces spicy, like we usually get. I forgot and my hubby wasn't paying attn. She didn't even ask if we wanted regular--just assumed. We come here often enough that she should recognize us. Horrible customer service. KFC is just down the road. Maybe we will try them next time we have a hankerin for fried chicken."}
{"text":"First time I tried a Church's Chicken was on the east coast. Now, twenty years later, decided to try this one. Does have a few different items on the menu, but the chicken still tastes the same. The Mac n cheese is loaded with salt. Would be better if they added Jalapeños and a Panko crust to it. The mashed potatoes are instant. I know, a shocker! The gravy is somewhat decent with a kick of pepper. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"You're better off going to Raising canes or the new KFC down the street! They never give you the free lemonade that clearly states it COMES with the meal. Tonight I called & the guy who was in drive thru answered & said, \"cuz u didn't ask for it\" & laughed. The menu says you don't have to ask for it, moron. Do not go here until they change the staff."}
{"text":"I waited for a very long time to receive my food. This is the worst chicken I've ever had. The corn also tasted awful. Went all to trash can."}
{"text":"Came in here and it was pretty busy. Two customers in front of me were upset at the service. I understand why. These ladies were on their phone, making fun of their customer's with complaints in clear sight- i had ordered two spicy chicken and they gave me plain. I came up to tell them and they were on their cellphones. LOL management where art thou? Unprofessionalism to it's finest, talking ish in spanish."}
{"text":"Decent ghetto fast food chicken. The place is a little run down and in a part of town where homeless people urinate on the side of the road in broad daylight. (I am NOT kidding!!) However, if you're looking for some decent chicken and don't mind someone asking for your change as you walk back to your car, it's worth a trip. Coming to this place reminds me of that Elvis song... \"It's another hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto!!\""}
{"text":"I don't understand the beef everyone has with this location.  I went through the drive thru and the service was prompt and friendly. My order was correct and I have zero complaints about service, food quality, etc. This location is hands down day and night better than the Spring Mountain and Decatur location! Next time I get an urge for some spicy, fried chicken goodness, this will be my spot!"}
{"text":"Im so happy this opened up in Brampton. More fried chicken options is always welcomed! I grew up eating this when it use to be with Harveys. Anyone remember those days? For me, its part nostalgia. I like the spicy chicken. The plain one is ok but spicy is way better. The honey biscuits are a nice change compared to the salt pucks at popeyes. Chicken was decent in size. The worker was also pretty friendly. I would come back for sure! 4 stars ****"}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience a few days ago. Ordered from the drive through, had a woman take our order and give us our food, but the name on the receipt was Luis. Upon dropping the food off to our friend who was watching and feeding our kids with it, she immediately called us saying the food looks like it'll get us sick. I don't know if we can eat it. I wish we had pictures of the 2 year old looking fries and the pinker chicken. I called the store and asked to speak to a manager, who sounded like a young man, didn't give a name. Asked him what our options were to resolve the situation since I had the receipt but my friend had the food. I had sent her all the receipts and he asked if we wanted a refund or a new order. The kids were hungry so we opted for another order. He sounded like he was going to get it taken care of no problem. Upon getting to the store, my friend was told the chicken was not raw but was supposed to be gray and pink on the inside when it's dark meat. Maybe we have different opinions on how dark meat chicken should be cooked. He proceeded to tell my friend \"I'll remake the chicken to make you feel better.\" Nice. That's why we wanted the chicken remade, to feel better. The second part of the comment was not needed. I think I'll stick to Popeyes not as pink chicken. I wish we took pictures of the meat closer to the bone on a thigh piece, which would show a more comparable difference. The pictures were from the second batch that we were over after dealing with the management."}
{"text":"The last time I had Churchs Chicken..1982, Columbia, SC..while stationed at Ft Jackson. Ah..the crispy crust on the chicken..save that for last when the chicken has all runned out. 2 days before payday, no money..Church's ALWAYS let me get enough chicken to feed my Transportation Squad. FIRST thing when I got paid..I paid them back and left a huge tip too. So, when I moved South..I kept on saying I want me some Church's Chicken. Well last night I did go.

First thing I notice..no smell of chicken grease. Place is clean and smelled clean also. Customer service.. The Manger on duty..my hat goes off to you Madam. It's not easy running a tight ship..dealing with customers. The one who came in after eating 2 pieces of an 8 piece and some of the fries.. I too would have just gave him his money back and hoped in just walks out the door. Who needs the hassle right?

The had fried okra too!! Not enough salt on it to my liking, but hey ya still had it for sale. What? Did they change the recipe, or has my taste buds changed over the many years?

GOOD chicken stands up for itself if.. One, you leave it out..like in a microwave overnight..and it STILL has it's flavor and crispiness in the mid morning. Yep, it passed.

My overall experience..ah, brought back memories. But you know one thing.. Over time I know things change. I wished they could have kept the same design, the same packaging from the early 80's. I wonder if the one in Columbia, SC is still there? I'm planning a trip to find out."}
{"text":"I've been to a Church's once before, but don't quite remember how it was (good thing I'm a Yelper now!), so I'm just comparing this location to other locations of other fast food joints. 

The staff at this location is super friendly, and were kind enough to let me know that my order would've taken 20 minutes, so let me switch. However, the place smells like old grease, which didn't make me feel very good.

Food-wise, nothing special, but nothing bad. I got the 2-piece with fried okra and my s/o got spicy tenders with fries. I think my chicken  tasted better than his, but he doesn't like bone in his meat. The biscuits were definitely the highlight."}
{"text":"I love this place everytime i go they are very friendly and help me get the most for my money. The staff is nice and make sure i always leave with everything from utensils to sauces. Definetly my go to place."}
{"text":"They wouldn't except a coupon that expired a day earlier. Chick fil A takes any coupon even if it not from their store because that's what brought that customer in. Plus that person chose to eat your product. This is bad business."}
{"text":"Is there a ZERO star available?!!! Just picked up what used to be our favorite chicken. ITS HORRIBLE TODAY!!! Just called the \"so called\" manager. She said they are serving someone else's chicken. It's NOT Church's!!!! Who does that?!!!! Fraudulent!!!! I'm calling corporate!!!!  Got Pizza?!!!"}
{"text":"This church's chicken is so stingy!!! First of all, don't even try calling in for a large order, they never pick up the phone. So my co-worker and i ended up just going in to order. We order $75 worth of food for the entire office. Then we ask for sauce and the Indian female manager immediately intervened and said we can only have 8 tiny packets of sauce. Are you kidding me? We just ordered $75 worth of food and we can only have 8 little packets of sauce??? Crazy. Extra sauce $0.25 each. What a complete joke. Manager had the worse attitude too. The Hispanic cashier lady was nicer, but couldn't do anything about the rude manager. Stingy place. Hope you like paying extra for sauce."}
{"text":"I remember every Sunday back home in Chicago, Churches was the place to go if Sunday dinner wasn't prepared. Today, it's still an evening staple to congregate and enjoy with friends or yourself. 

How can you even mess up chicken? Well you can, and you know and both know this. This particular location is across the street from a empty KFC (lol), it is surrounded by homeless people but they want hassle you, you will just see them walking around. Big deal, get over yourself fancy nancy and eat. 
I usually get the spicy chicken when I'm here and evertytime it's always great, the jalapeño poppers are great and I add fries. One tasty tip is that to get the jalapeño cheddar(that's probably not correct) sauce, dip it in your fries. YOU'RE WELCOMMMEEEEE! It's for the poppers but it taste good one the fries and even the chicken. 

Service here is great, I'm not sure if it's because I always enter and call the employees by their name tags(you should do it and watch the difference in there attitude). Suggestions are always given if you ask them and they are nice. 

Deals are always here at Churches such as the $5 box with 2 pieces, 2 sides and a biscuit. Speaking of biscuits, they have always been fresh for me and YES Churches biscuits are better than Popeyes(argue with me). 

It's a small restaurant but the seating is really great, 4 seater tables. Great to take a break, sit, eat and chill before you hit the road again. 

5 stars because I have zero complaints, or improvements. Go here & get food!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad meal here 
Chicken sandwich was good

This place has been there awhile so I'm assuming most people that eat here enjoy it

Not crazy bout the fries, hence the three stars but with that said I'd go back, why not"}
{"text":"The chicken and biscuits are absolutely amazing. 
It was hard for me to give 1 star because it's so good.  

The 1 star is for the awful service. 9/10 times my order is wrong. A simple 2 piece combo. I don't get it. Also, one lady tried to argue with me and say I didn't order something when I know I did. That's really poor customer service. 

Last night is what really made me want to write a review, I sat behind 1 car for 15 minutes while they were at the window. 15 minutes. 1 car. 1 table inside. The car behind me actually backed out and I thought about doing the same. The car finally leaves and I get to the window and the guy doesn't even greet me right away or say sorry. I sat there 5 more minutes, nothing. I drove off. 20 minutes for nothing. 

Also, I agree with the person that said if you don't ask for condiments, you don't get any. 
That goes for everything there: napkins/ketchup/salt/honey/your correct order"}
{"text":"Wow......this chicken has got to be one of the best chicken I've ever tasted.....it's nothing compared to KFC...it has a nice kick to it and a little zingy too!! It's always pipping hot and it beats making them yourself!! Also try their fried okra if you like that!!! Yum Yum!!! I'm getting a craving rt now!!!  Pllsssss bring Church's to SF!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a nine piece. Was wondering why the mixed kid came from the back and was staring at me and the little mexican girl was smiling so hard at me. Got all the way home and these jerks gave me a 5 piece. Thats not even a mistake, thats just hateful. Please give these hateful kids a raise so they can stop eating the customers food."}
{"text":"Baaaaaaad customer service all the way around!!!!! I will not be back here again!. She got my order wrong did it again gave most of my food away and i still waited. This is not customer service."}
{"text":"This is the best churches chicken I have ever been to the mashed potatoes were great with the wonderful gravy, the chicken tenders were so juicy and enjoyable just how I expected them to be service was great they were so kind and respected me BEST CHICKEN EVER"}
{"text":"I like Church's better than other fast chicken places, but this location is horrible. The first time I went, I waited in the drive through almost 40min. By the time I got to the window, they were out of the food I ordered. I waited a year before trying again. Second time I waited almost 20min in the drive through. The chicken sandwich was not good at all. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is poorly run and understaffed. 15 minutes minimum for them fill a simple order for a 3 piece. Completely inept and rude employees. The definition of \"fast food\" is nowhere near what this restaurant represents. Kitchen and lobby consistently filthy with condiments under stocked in the lobby as well. Seriously it should not be this difficult to order and receive food. Wish there was more than in the area, because although I enjoy  the chicken, this particular restaurant and staff leave a lot to be desired. Try it if you like your fast food served slow in a filthy environment with incompetent staff."}
{"text":"They have Honey Butter batter chicken strips 
SOOOOO Delicious there is a special right now 
3 strips 2 side and a biscuit for $4.99 and a drink for $1.00 more try it you wiilllllll love them  the staff are really nice too clean bathroom."}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times.  I always go inside to place my order, so cannot rate the drive-through. The service has always been super.  Inside, the people are always quick to acknowledge me, polite and friendly when processing my order, and it is 99% of the time correct.  (One time they forgot to include the jalapenos...not a biggie.)   The only issue I have with Church's Chicken is the size of the chicken breasts...or do you even serve them anymore?  The white meat segments seem to be nothing but a wing attached to part of a back.  Where is the breast meat?!?"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Good portions and great taste. Location is great (right beside Second Cup). Great menu selection. Staff were very friendly as well (minus one rude young girl who was disrespectful to her manager/supervisor).  I'll definitely be back.  I hope they open more locations! :-)"}
{"text":"Greasy chicken, old oil used apparently havent changed oil. Very disappointed in customer service."}
{"text":"Generally, Church's is not a place to expect much but it's at least adequate.  My order started off with a broken ordering speaker.  Once I received my order I had to turn around and head back because my sides were wrong.  This was the first time I had actually been inside this store and it stinks like rancid grease.  The staff is apologetic and corrects my order so I leave happy enough.  I then have to return again once I open the giant box of chicken strips, only to find the small, cold hard strips of chicken huddling in one forth of the oversized box.  Once again, I return to the grease pit to have chicken over explained to me by a lady I can only assume was in charge.  Her lack of name tag made it impossible to know who she was, but she was the loudest, rudest person in the shop.  After having a good 45 minutes of my day wasted I left with hot, properly sized chicken.  This place is a relic and needs to be shut down."}
{"text":"Worst customer service EVER. 

My boyfriend and I came here just to get 10 pcs chicken. We have been here for 20 min. And the workers have not taken our order. There were only 2 people working. One was taking drive-thru orders and the other one was getting the food ready. 

When I look at the back, I saw 2 workers just talking and chilling. I don't know if there were on break or something, but I know both workers in the back saw that it was busy and didn't have even help their co-workers.. 


I don't think I won't be coming here anymore.... They don't even deserve to get a star. 

FYI, if you want your food faster, just go through drive-thru"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.
Rude manager, seems like they don't even care about their job. Had the experience of witnessing people in front of me getting bad service, and of course I had it too.

Food tastes like it has been cooked for hours.

HORRIBLE place , can't believe they don't understand how they push people away."}
{"text":"My first experience sucked! Food cooked fresh. .I had to wait 10 min. ..... Got home to feed hubby. Eat quick and off to second job. .. And I must of gotten someone else's order!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent! Its very similar to Popeye' s however it tasted less greasy. Glad to have once in the GTA."}
{"text":"Price's Chicken Coop does better in terms of service nad you must read my review of that place. 

But man~ nostalgic for Church's I talked my crew into we must have dinner from here tonight. This place is out of chicken on a Wednesday night at or around 8pm. Told 15minutes on the wait. Left and returned, they were out of chicken again. 

The other customers were the delight of the night. Funny and entertaining in the the worst and stereotypical way. This is for the Church's off Freedom - get it together!"}
{"text":"Be warned: this place is fickle. 
They accept coupons even via phone but I was told today by the Hispanic worker not the SE Asian owner - that the \"We can't charge you for mix if the coupon doesn't say so\"

I expect an upcharge and explained just charge what you all charge as I know white meat is more. Nope! Because the coupon doesn't say this can be mixed.

This is the only location with Dirty Rice so it's worthwhile. The service has been better before when the men and the teenagers are working. I have gotten dry old rice before but brought it back the following time I was in the area and I received an apology no questions asked. Which makes me think this might have happened before so that's why I got no push back. 

I know Church's gets a bad rap for being cheap and greasy but not always the case. I prefer it over all others (except the local Southern Classic) and usually don't have any real issues. West Trade/Beatties Ford location can be rough but they mean well."}
{"text":"The chicken was great. I don't even mind waiting because its worth it. What got me was the employees personal conversations. I and the other customers (about 6 of us) don't care who you're dating and why he keeps calling other women. I was so put off by this and this is the main reason that I'm writing a review. On a positive note, I could see the work ethic through the sideshow. 

This location needs to be expanded or remodeled. The inside looks dated and Its hard as hell to exit the property because of the plethora of traffic traveling south on Rancho. If you're leaving this restaurant you got one direction, South. In my case I had to drive past the freeway and hit a U-turn which took an extra 8 minutes with the light pattern. I made a right on Bonanza which is the same damned intersection which I had left 8 minutes ago!! I drove past Popeyes on the catty corner or in other words diagonal of Church's and that place was a ghost town. 

Church's needs to expand. We'd be happy to have you in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I waited almost 30 minutes in the drive thru for a 2 piece meal. There were only 4 cars in front of me and no reason given for extremely long wait. Got home with my food and I didn't have a spoon for my mashed potatoes and no napkin for my greasy chicken. Team really didn't seem to care!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali and my favorite place for fried chicken is Church's.  I feel as I'm home. Great food! Love their honey biscuits. I like that they offer spicy chicken. Employees are very friendly."}
{"text":"yo, this location is as bad as these other reviews make it out
-staff didn't know menu/ specials that we came for
-dropped one of our orders on the floor in front of us 
-packed so that my food all fell out of containers into bag anyway
-one order of mashed potatoes didn't even have gravy
-lobby a mess
-watched someone order and pay for a large order of spicy only to be told they don't have any 
-no napkins/ utensils
all of these seem minor but all in the course of a 3 minute stop? naw. just go to a different location. this one apparently doesn't even participate in the monthly specials/ promotions which is the reason I go to this chain in the first place"}
{"text":"This place deserves 0 stars. First time here, and definitely the last time. I'm writing to corporate after this, and I suggest you do too.

We were pretty much ignored when we walked in. The workers were too busy complaining how many people they were losing in the drive thru because they ran out of white chicken. 
We placed our order, and the guy didn't even know what buttons to press.
When we got home, SEVERAL items were missing. We called the place and asked how they can serve chicken fried steak without the gravy that goes with it. The girl replied they can still sell it even without the gravy. She didn't care about all the items missing and then hung up the phone on us!

The establishment was very dirty, especially in the kitchen. It might need to be investigated. They get a 0 in customer service!

Bad, bad experience. Shame on you Church's Chicken."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a bucket of fried chicken.   I like their coleslaw.   I would always order the mixed 10 pieces legs and thighs bucket chicken.   The customer service was excellent.   They always pack you extra napkins, ketchup & hot sauce packets in the bag."}
{"text":"Got my throw back thrill of crispy crunchy, AHHHH!"}
{"text":"So I sit in this line for 15 mins before my order was even taken due to computer error so my order was finally taken I do get an apology for waiting for so long but it was because day shift didn't prepare anything  mind u it's 8pm not cool. JUST HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ALL THE WAY AROUND!!!! I always come here , won't be back for a LONG TIME!"}
{"text":"So my debit card was charged twice for 33.00 when I go back to ask where is my money I was told I have to wait until Tomorrow to have my money refunded!!!!!! It took 3 seconds to take it ......unacceptable"}
{"text":"Horrible wait times! Went last night for a quick meal for the family & was in line 40+ mins.. I could've just got out of line and went elsewhere but I was trapped by the car in front of me and car behind me- just horrible definitely won't go back.."}

The biscuit was different than what I am accustomed to but it was good.

I enjoyed the baked macaroni & cheese."}

{"text":"Their chickens are always fresh! And i love their biscuits, it is a must have every time i go there. i dont go to popeyes or KFC or CNJ anymore"}
{"text":"Only because I have yo give at least one. Please if you care about what you're putting in your body stay away from this location and place. Please horrible customer service. I seen the cook in the back drop some chicken then put it back into where the chicken goes up front sorry I witnessed that I will not be back"}
{"text":"How DARE you all give this place two stars... It's AT LEAST three!

I think their food tasted pretty good, actually. But that is only specifying taste. You can tell it was looking just a little suspect, but I regularly find myself walking up and down the danger zone, so I went for it. Got some fried chicken with both Macaroni and Mashed potatoes as sides, and again suspect aesthetics or not... it tasted good.

Problem came internally afterwards. My stomach going full Adele with the aching noises for quite a bit. That was until the bowels accompanied the backup vocals. Wasn't pleasant.

But that's when you take the highway to the danger zone. I'm gonna be safe for a little bit before I find myself making more bad decisions.

If it looks suspect, it probably is suspect."}
{"text":"Terrible. First time I've eaten at churches and I realized was missing nothing. Honestly I rather have KFC and I'm not a fan of KFC."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 piece chicken. Had to throw the entire meal away because they all had weird dark areas on them and one had a tag cooked along with it!!! Disgusting"}
{"text":"The bomb.com !  I don't get the point of comparing it to Popeye's.  If you want that type of chicken GO THERE!  I love this Church's.  Always hot and on point!  Service is pretty fast.  The location is slightly ratchet but the service and food is worth it."}
{"text":"It's crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. It's fast food priced decent. Their counter people are rather impersonal robots. I didn't like the drive thru girl when I drove up 10 mins before close. As soon as I get to the speaker she asked what I wanted and said I have to look at the menu first. Then she had the audacity to remind me they were closing in 10 mins. LIKE I'M GOING TO TAKE 10 MINUTES DECIDING! MY GAWD YOU MILLENNIALS HAVE NO CLASS, NO CONSIDERATION AND ARE SO STUPID!"}
{"text":"Stop by tonight at 9 pm. Not a customer in the place. Employee tells me no white meat chicken 20 minutes to cook. What type of chicken place doesn't have chicken ready? It's fast food not a restaurant...stick with Popeyes or KFC!"}
{"text":"When I was a kid, my dad used to fry bologna for dinner. 
I hated it. 
It was so greasy, it left a film in my mouth...as if my tongue was coated with some sort of lard.
Well if you like this sort of thing, I highly recommend going to Church's. 

I ate there last week. Afterward, one of the women in my office asked if I lost a bet.
When I pressed, asking why she'd say something like that,  she responded;

 \"I noticed you had lip gloss on.\""}
{"text":"Great chicken my favorite. This place here on flamingo is my go to spot . Delicious crispy tasty chicken . Beats Popeyes by a mile ."}
{"text":"Boneless bbq wings= yum..... They rest is as expected....I like the new hush puppies they serve."}
{"text":"The manager ignores your complaints. Customer support an service are completely wrong! I can't believe how they treated me. Then again I guess I can accept the fact I am black an someone must have pissed them off before hand. Idk  I hate being ignored especially after my order was wrong. They didn't great me like they did other customers. And totally forgot she asked me what size drink- I told her what kind an she said it's self serve, Okay cool'! She was no help by not charging me for it! Then had to charge my card twice. Wouldn't mind if my bank didn't charges fees every time I swipe. Pissed me off! Then I asked for the manager number and she ignored me. I noticed she had an iPhone I texted. Ignored. Then blocked.  I hope her business never successfully succeed. I just wanted her to hear how her staff are with customers. I declined the free meal just to speak to her. Smh"}
{"text":"They just can never get a simple order right! You order $25 dollars worth of food, and they can only give you two little ranch dipping sauces! I should have just gone across the street to The Mexican joint!"}
{"text":"I am an absolute junkie for fast food chicken and Church's is a restaurant chain I have not visited in over a decade. Not by choice but because  they have closed all the locations that were even remotely near me. 

I was quite happy that I found a location near my hotel and was excited to visit this old friend. Sad to say that it didn't have the same taste that I remembered. Maybe I am tasting through rose colored glasses but I found the coating of the chicken to be bland. The crunch was there, the moist chicken was there but the flavor of the coating was not. Once I doused hot sauce on it it came back to life a little but that shouldn't be the case as I want my chicken to stand on its own.

The sides were the best part. I love crinkle cut fries (not as much as tater) and theirs delivered potato taste and a crunchy exterior and creamy interior. The Honey Butter Biscuit is flat out the best biscuit in the fast food market and puts the competitors to shame.

It was nice to catch up with an old friend. But one of us has changed."}
{"text":"worthless staff,food,atmosphere. no greeting. in other words it sucks!!!!
never again there out of business, they just don't know it yet"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I last had fried chicken.  As a matter of fact I haven't even tried Church's chicken either.  Picked some up today because my mother in law had a request some chicken for dinner.  

Came to this location since it was the closest to home.  As I recall, fried chicken, generally speaking of the main stream ones, are expensive.  I picked up a family meal of 15 pcs with 3 sides and bread rolls for $25.  Honestly, wouldn't come back to pay that much because I can get much better tasting meals at that price, but just fulfilling a request today.

Satisfactory customer service at this location.  Chicken-dark meat was crispy and hot when I got home, bread I must say was tastiest compared to other competitors, mash and cole slaw isn't nothing out of this world.  Was just too expensive for fried chicken."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY, so many things wrong, vomit on the floor, EVERY table dirty, toilet flooded, wrong food delivered, had to ask for napkins.  When I took the food up to get it fix, the manager gave an \"I don't care, but i will fix it if I have to,\" attitude."}
{"text":"This location sucks. They messed up my order twice in one night and didn't even offer to compensate me. Never going back."}
{"text":"I've frequented this location for the last 8 years so I'm sad that the food quality has been so poor lately I will not go back.  Our chicken breasts were all cold and tasted old. The okra was cold and squishy. The only good thing was the girl who took our order was very friendly. Please fix this place!"}
{"text":"Walked in. Saw a worker step out of the bathroom with his pants half down and then he zipped them up as he entered the kitchen. Proceeded to walk directly out the door."}
{"text":"It was Saturday night and wanted to grab something for the family. I usually love this place because I can get off the bus, order and get food in plenty of time for the next bus. Tonight was a totally different experience, I walk in around 6pm, tell the cashier I want a 15 piece all white meat meal, which costs considerably more and price always varies depending who is at the register but usually by a couple of bucks however they are quick and friendly so I always look past it. After placing my initial request the cashier gets a confused looks on his face and runs back to ask someone if they do \"all white\" meals, he comes back out with another gentleman and he says all they have are wings but if I wait 15 minutes they are cooking 2 breasts. I asked if I could get it discounted since it wont be an all white meal and he said no, he inquired why I could not wait and I told him I needed to catch the next bus or I would be stranded 6 miles from home. He then suggested I go across the street to Jack in the box that they might be quicker, he said they were better then JIB. AT this point im getting upset and asked to speak with his manager, he said he was the manager, then I requested a corporate number to which he said there was no corporate, I asked who was above him and he said the owner but he refused to give me any contact info for him. I have always been treated great here so I am shocked that this has happened, I never complain but this time it seems necessary so this guy doesnt get away with treating customers in such and manor and giving Churches a bad name. By the way I have already spoke to their corporate office, the one he said did not exist and I will NOT be returning and no we did not eat jack in the box for dinner."}
{"text":"Waited forever for my order to be taken, forever to receive it.  Of course. ..it was horrible.  I dont know what part of the chicken I was given, but it was not a wing. Almost $9 for a 3 piece combo that should have been wings. At least everything was hot. That's the only reason I am not giving one star."}
{"text":"People got this chicken place hyped. Upside was their bomb biscuits! It was flaky and sweet and just good. Their chicken was just like Popeyes chicken! The only difference is, their chicken here is about 1$ a piece. Which I found pricy."}
{"text":"I love Church's Chicken.  This location is horrible.  I've been in the drive-thru line for the last 25 minutes.  This is how I found the time to write this review.  There was only about 5 cars in front of us when we got here.  No big line.  When we finally got to order,  they tell us that they don't have what we want (any spicy chicken).  They tell us it will be another 15-20 minutes.  Horrible location.  Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"A better version of KFC, cheap authentically trashy but that's fine. The mashed potatoes were their \"recommended side\" stiffer than Summer 98 at band camp. Overall a 4 though"}
{"text":"Worst church's chicken EVER. I'm new to the avondale area so I figured I'd try the nearest church's chicken. BIG mistake. I was literally in line for 45 mins and when we got up to the window, there were 3 girls standing around talking. We got home only to find out that they forgot all of our biscuits. Worst part, the chicken was disgusting. It was the toughest piece of chicken I've ever had. I took 1 bite and didn't touch the rest b/c it didn't even look like it was cooked right. I didn't even feed that chicken to my dog. I will NEVER go back to this location & the manager will be getting an ear full tomorrow morning."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Church's I've been to. I've been here 4 times now and this will be my last (I only gave them so many shots because I LOVE Church's, I've never had what i would classify as a good experience here). The customer service is horrible, they dont honor promotions being advertised nation wide, they're slow, and this last time i actually went in to order and the dining room was filthy. I would normally not take issue with that last one, but there was nobody in there except me, nobody in the drive through, and 3 employees just talking in the back. If you are absolutely craving fast food chicken do yourself a favor and go to either KFC or Popeye's down the street. Neither or them are world class either, but they're miles ahead of this sh.. show."}
{"text":"Church's Chicken is excellent by comparison to other fast food industry chains.  The Country Club Dr. store in Mesa, AZ is small for the customer base they have. They sell a lot of meals at this store and it gets so busy that their is a line to the door for customers to be served at the single cash register on the counter. The Church's Chicken Corporation should do several things, first realize that they have an almost a cult following of their product and honor that in a way the reflects in their stores, by second; updating their facilities, restrooms, and expanding their dining areas and service counters. That's probably a hard sell, but with the volume of business that is done, certainly taking a leap forward and building stores that are more roomy, modern, cleanly, and have more space for employees to operate in kitchens should become a priority.  I can easily see Church's Chicken become a nation wide franchising operation, as they are not currently operating in my state. When they do start, I hope they will have read this post and open modern stores with modern design. If you don't each at Church's you should, because their fried chicken is excellent as are their biscuits with honey! 4 stars on the chicken and biscuits!"}
{"text":"This place is horribly good...Went here a few weeks ago, got the spicy, came home and had a few bloody marys with this greasy chicken.  I hardly ever eat fried chicken but this place most likely will change my mind.  i can appreciate other reviews about this place but i think that if a place is running out of stuff, i would think that its because it's so good, right? Workers there worked hard and were super nice."}
{"text":"Usually Church's is ok food.  Tonight the service and the food were the worst I have had anywhere in months.  I guess its because all the employees were paying more attention  to the basketball game and not to the customers.  They told me my extra long wait was for my fries, but when I got them, they were luke warm,.  confusing since I was told they just came out of the fryer.  The girl at the counter called me when my order was ready, but gave me only half of what I wanted.   Then, when she finally assembled the order, they put it in a bag so small, it would not hold everything.  When I got home, I found that the extra biscuit I had ordered had my jalapeno in the same bag.  All the jalapeno juice had leaked onto the biscuit, so i had a sack of wet dough.  It just annoys me to no end when employees will not pay attention th why customers come to their restaurants.  I eat out 85% of my meals, and I can go anywhere.  I happen to like chicken, but am tires of Church's and their give a shit attitude towards the customer.  I know I spend too much on Fast food, but that is what these people want.  Stay away from this one, It is ridiculous."}
{"text":"So if you come to this Churches... Make sure to smell your chicken before consuming it. And when you do, EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!  They don't actually get any stars. 

For real, We just got a whole chicken meal for dinner worth $43 dollars, so we get home to start to enjoy our dinner only to find out that the ones my sister began to eat were some nasty sour smelling and tasting pieces of chicken. We had already eaten like 5 pieces, which were ok, then my sister smelled another and same funky taste and smell. So my sister called churches and the rudest manager answers the phone and then tells us in order to fix the issue we have to bring back all the chicken, to bring back all the food to get our money back. Which would have been fine, we gladly would have BUT Miriam (the manager) answers and is a complete smart a** B**** (forgive my language but there is no way to explain how awful she was on the phone) so we asked to speak to someone above her and she said that we could call her mother, but if we did she would tell us the same thing. So we stop eating, packed what was left, (which was half of the order) and went back to show them how yucky it really was. 
We got there, went in and asked for the manager. When my sister says that she just called, a woman walks up with a loud bitchy voice and crappy attitude. After calling my sister babe a couple times, she asked us what was the problem so we told her, and asked her to smell the chicken. She refused to at the very least to smell it to know what exactly we were talking about. In a rude and loud tone she proceeded to say that she would switch it out, but we told her that we just wanted our refund like she said she would give us if we brought it back on the phone. We told her she didn't need to raise her voice at us which apparently only made her yell louder at us. Every time we tried to get in a few words she talked over us, and shut us down by continuing being rude. Then she pulls off a fresh piece of chicken and tells the next customer to have a piece on her, to see if he thinks it's good. But I was like that's a fresh piece! You just cooked that. Both my sister and I say, that's not what is in the box. Then she tells us that we could go into her freezer to check all the other chicken. And my sister said we brought back the chicken and just wanted the refund she said that she'd give us. But she refused to do so and then finally said she would refund the pieces we brought back, so we said that's fine.
But that point I wasn't so bother by getting nasty ass sour smelling chicken anymore I was more surprised, annoyed and irritated by her attitude, tone, and volume. Never have I ever dealt with a manager of a place with such awful, and I mean AWFUL customer service. And I'm the nice one. I'm the patient, calm one when it comes to speaking to managers about a place service. So that's gotta say something, when I get pissed and I even begin to raise my voice something is really wrong. I feel bad that if she talked to us like that I wonder how she is with her employees.

So eat here at your own risk and know that the manager Miriam domes not have any idea what good customer service is. And know that even if you are nice about an issue she's going to still be rude and loud. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK. We def won't be going back, cuz chicken should not smell or taste like it did. That's can not be good and safe to eat. Make sure to smell it and Eat at your own risk. I for sure will be calling to make sure that corporate knows how bad the food and service was, and on top of that the managers crappy customer service. I for 1 will not be feeding my family with this nastiness. And 2 no one should have to pay for foul smelling and tasting chicken and a awful attitude from the manager. 

I get we all have crappy days, and dealing with customers sometimes is really difficult and frustrating at times, the customer isn't always right, but it's customer service. In any case the manager shouldn't have been rude and just been calm and fix the situation, but nope she was plain rude and unhelpful."}
{"text":"This review is for a takeout order.  I hadn't had Church's fried chicken in what, 20 years? 30 years?  I remember avoiding it because the rolls were those terrible, heat-n-serve dinner rolls I've always hated.  Well, the rolls aren't bad anymore.  They're sweet, which is a little weird since it's not a dessert bread, but they taste good.  The chicken is delicious.  I enjoy the fried okra a lot.  The macaroni and cheese is sort of lackluster.  The mashed potatoes are not nearly as good as my mom's, but what do you expect at a fast food joint?  The gravy is tasty and saves the mashed potatoes.  
They also have spicy chicken, which I can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Way too good. I had my reservations about the place, but a couple of family members have already been and recommend Church's Chicken over Popeyes and KFC and I can see why now!

Their chicken is spicy, but not too overly spicy and it's pleasantly surprising. Give the place a try. :)"}
{"text":"Stars are for the chicken! There tenders are very good! They didn't get 5 stars tho cause their employee has a shitty attitude & is lucky I went through drive through. Little chick wouldn't have liked it if I went inside, asked for some sauce and instead she walks away, we are hanging at the window trying to wave her down thinking maybe she didn't hear us, but instead she grabbed a rag and went in the lobby. Oh & she seen us."}
{"text":"Food was good, fresh and hot. Customer service was solid, but the location is pretty dresdful."}
{"text":"Poor employees. Nice, but really as dumb as a sack of hammers. It is what it is I guess.
Service in the DT was mind numbingly SLOW, but the food was good, hot and correct."}
{"text":"Slow service and the guy behind the counter seemed to care less about being at work. Waited quite a long time for food when other people who ordered after us got their food before us. One of the workers had their friends in there as a distraction as well."}
{"text":"I've always heard raving reviews about this chicken, and finally I am able to add to the lists of its fanfare. I was completely amazed at the quality for the price. I ordered a 3 piece meal, extra biscuits (which by the way were mouthwatering) and as a bonus I threw in an apple pie! If first impressions still matter then I'm completely sold. I see lots of visits in my future."}
{"text":"I wouldn't eat there if they gave the food away. Poor service, rude employees, undercooked chicken, rowdy customers and drug dealers in the parking lot. If you're not a regular customer they'll give you dried out food that's been under the lights for hours. The absolute tragedy is the shoot out and killing that happened there in February 2018. This location is a plight on the rapidly changing neighborhood and should close immediately. I must rate it one star to submit this review. Unfortunately, I can't rate this location a zero. Do not frequent this store..."}

THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN YOU CAN GET IN THE WEST COAST!!!"}

But the management is sooo cheap!!! I ask for ketchup and hot sauce, he gave me 5 hot sauce. I ask where is the ketchup, he took 3 hot sauce away and have me 4 ketchup!!! I said I need more hot sauce. He replied you already have hot sauce there....seriously!!!! I gave him back 2 ketchup, he have me 2 hot sauce back!!!! Omg!!! Why do I have to barter condiment at a fast food place!!! I never heard of bartering condiment before at any place, seriously management.....STOP BEING SO CHEAP!!!"}
{"text":"If I can put no stars I would. I ordered 20pc meal 4 sides being 2 mash, mac n cheese, coleslaw, 8 biscuits and another 20pc chicken on the side with 12 extra biscuits. (I have a huge family.) Before I had left They had my order wrong on the receipt so I had told the guy at the window that it was wrong so he corrected my order not on the receipt but he had gave me another box of chicken with 10pc. It wasn't til I got home that I knew the sides were missing. Mac n Cheese n mash was missing. Not to mention the chicken was burnt, it tasted burnt not one but all the pcs we received. I had called to let them know that they forgot 2 sides and the chicken is burnt. I asked for a manager and the lady replied they were not there, I asked for her name and she said she didn't know.  This was at 8:30pm today. We do not live near churchs so I drove 20min thinking its just like back home. But it was not worth it to go bck for 2 sides and it wouldnt make sense to take bck chicken that was burnt when my family was already waiting. I was real disappointed in the service. The service and quality of the food was disappointing, will not be going to churchs again after this experience. I would like to speak to a manager from this location. The worker by the name Desire Diaz who worked the Tuesday night shift needs more training on how to speak to customers and whoever else was working needs training on giving the correct orders when it was a simple order."}
{"text":"Just went Churchs Chicken in Surprise Arizona and was called a skinhead and he thanks us for our people eating there. This is because I told him that they got my order wrong. He said F@#$ YOU you didn't order what you think you did. I told him I was calling corporate he said F@#$ them I own this place not them. I paid a million dollars for this place not you. There is the road now go away you F#$%ing skinhead. This is very nice for my first and last time ever eating there. Now everyone will know what a raciest this owner is. Just because I am white and have short hair Im a skinhead. WOW -If there was a zero star that is what they would get."}
{"text":"This place is just ok!

It's no Popeyes but I love their French fries. Something about crinkle cut fries brings me back to childhood lol

Their chicken needs some spice and seasoning and Color. It's cooked but its so pale, it lacking seasoning I think.
It's no Popeyes lol
I like the honey butter glazed biscuits! 

This place is just ok. I would go if I was on st. Clair didn't want to spend much money and was Starving!"}
{"text":"I've literally never been treated worse in my life. I've come in here twice and both times it took a century for them to even notice that I was standing there. They would look at me and just walk past me and continue what they were doing. They wouldn't even smile. They just look at you and pretend you're not there.

After I ordered, I stood there waiting for twenty minutes and watched as person after person approached the counter and was treated the exact same way. When I said something about my long wait, the lady cut me off and pretended like she hadn't heard anything I just said. THIS IS THE EXACT SAME THING THE LADY DID THE FIRST TIME when she charged me twice for one meal and I tried to bring it to her attention. 

These ladies have no idea how to serve people and the whole restaurant was full of people complaining because they were being completely ignored and no one was even making their food. Someone needs to notice what terrible employees these chicks are because I've never seen so many angry people in one store at once in my life."}
{"text":"No drive thru at this location, but true-to-form Church's chicken. Not the healthest for you, but the original recipe is a good fried chicken fix. And their biscuits are the bomb."}
{"text":"The location is as old as I can remember.  Been there for at least two decades.  It always looks like it is in need of a remodel.  The service varies from good to just okay (due to the wait time being markedly long sometimes).  There are some menu items that are always sure to please such as:  honey biscuits, okra, corn nuggets and the original fried chicken.  There have been several new side items added to the menu over the past few years that does help keep this franchise afloat.  Remodel and hire more people so it isn't run with a minimal crew (which adds to longer wait times) and I would frequent the place more often."}
{"text":"Man, that was bad. Literally just finished eating my drive-thru order with the fam. We ordered a mixed 12 piece w/ 2 sides. The drumsticks were hard as a rock. Not crunchy, hard. Felt like they had been sitting out for hours. The chicken strips on the other hand were severely under cooked. Breading was almost soggy and the chicken was hard in the middle...strange! Overall food was disgusting and the wait was excessive considering there was only 1 car in front of me and we still waited 20 minutes. Other church's are usually good I won't EVER return to this one no matter how close to home it is. You probably shouldn't either. Serious dissapointment!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. It's the customer service in this location that is truly rotten. Maybe the drive through audio system is bad, but I was still in the middle of placing my order when the employee suddenly blurts out \"okay it will be (price)\". I would have added to my order still but the gesture turned me off. Good thing, as I said, that the food is good (or it was as expected, at least)."}
{"text":"Yuck!  The greasiest chicken I have ever had it made my stomach upset had to give it to the dog ! The mac and cheese was so nasty it was like soup.. more like slop ! The corn on the cob and the biscuit was the only thing eatable! Will never go here again... Sticking to Popeyes or KFC . Churches your chicken is NASTY !"}
{"text":"Went there last night.  First time in a while at this place and I know why I have not been back in so long... the store is full of incompetent people.   I used a coupon that clearly indicated what was included.   They took forever to get the order ready (7 piece mixed with large side and 4 biscuits). When I got the order I assumed it was all there.  NOPE.  Missing large side -Okra.  Well tried to call the store and notify them but phone number on the receipt was invalid.  Left a review on the app they now have and asked for a manager to call me back.  Nothing yet.  Just avoid this place and maybe they will just go out of business and a proper food joint can take its place.   By the way, not sure who cuts up their chicken, but the piece that supposed to be a breast was NOT."}
{"text":"Surprised how good it was. It's amazing how they can take a piece of chicken the size of a pencil...coat it ..deep fry it and make it look very big. Nice magic trick. The okra was a little too salty...but good. The service was attentive and fast. It is extremely rare that I ever eat fast food...maybe once a year...but gf informed me about the fried okra..which I find better than any french fries. The rest room could have used more maintenance."}
{"text":"Yes, Church's.  There is no KFC in my neck of the woods and that's fine so long as this place is here.  Whenever I'm jonesin' for chicken, I come here for the strip meal and sides (the best deal really--all white meat, no bones, no mess).  They also have fried okra, which is a real plus.

The only real problem that I have with this place is how long it takes to get your food.  I've had it take up to 15 minutes.  Once you get home and taste that chicken however, you forget about all that.

Great comfort food.  If you're a little depressed, there's nothing that Church's chicken, potatoes, and a little mac 'n' cheese can't fix.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great service!  Always takes our mobile coupons.  Chicken is fresh and fries are hot!"}
{"text":"Great chicken strips, fries, and biscuits. Wait is a little long, probably because they get a lot of business, but getting my food fresh makes up for it."}
{"text":"12:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. Frustrated from driving around looking for this place that is located inside the food court in the mall but relieved that I finally found it. Only to be told that a 10 piece chicken only order would take 20 minutes. Lunch hour and I am asked to wait 20 minutes. Not happening, I had to get back to the office. So many businesses and food establishments are guilty of not having inventory on hand. I left which equals no sale.

{"text":"Well where do I even start? I wish Yelp had -0 stars as an option. Running errands I decided to go here. Initially I wanted to go in, better opportunities to have fresh food but the parking lot was under construction. Drive thru. Two cars were ahead of me. I got to order rather quickly. This is the fun part. After ordering it took 15 min to get to the window!!! This place is SLOW AS HELL! I thought this was fast food people? I think two cars ahead of me just took off based on the wait time. 20 min I finally get the order. I get home (5 min) and the food is COLD! OMG! So pissed! I will NEVER go back! They suck!!"}
{"text":"There are much better chicken places to go to these days. They're slow and most of the sides come out cold. I leave with heartburn every time, even with the non spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Horrible service my food was messed up and got zero service or help from the staff that was extremely rude. Go to KFC"}
{"text":"Good greasy fried chicken! Yum!

Cole slaw is pretty good by fast food standards, it's a nice side to compliment greasy chicken. 

Service is fine, nothing more than what I would expect from a fast food joint.

I personally like their chicken strips the BEST!

I read the restaurant reports from the country health inspections and this restaurant usually gets an \"A \" rating for a clean inspection and no problems, which makes me feel a little more at ease about the cleanliness and consistency of the food. Plus, it's usually busy at his location too!

I like Church's WAY better than KFC!"}
{"text":"Pamela is just great, she had a smile on the whole time,   food is always hot and fresh.   and other then it being an old building it is always clean.   glad to see the employees keep it up thanks"}
{"text":"Their chicken is always fresh and crispy, don't care for most of their side, but love the chicken.  today we just got the 10 piece mix, and as usual it was good."}
{"text":"-Drive Thru Review-

Definitely a cheap price for what you get. I needed a small meal before heading back to my hotel so I wanted to get their 2 pc meal, but since they were out I had to opt for the tenders. 

Tenders were good, biscuit dense and slightly sweetened and a soda to wash it all down. Pretty cheap, compared to what I'm used to at drive thru's in California and tastes a lot better than Popeye's IMO. The only con is that I barely got any napkins and no ketchup/sauce."}
{"text":"FOOD POISON

Waited 30 minutes for cold biscuits and frozen chicken. And this was not my order.

When I told the manager, he looked at me and shrugged his shoulders. He could care less. Then I spoke with the senior manager and he was no help.

Moral of the story DO NOT come here. You might get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Are you freaking serious!? Ordered just a mashed potato and gravy and waited on the drive thru window for more than 10 mins! They didnt say they ran out or making another batch. Its just that nobody came in the window until my order was ready. Food was food but service was terrible!"}
{"text":"Late night thought, hungry after work, drive through Church's Chicken, ordered 1- 3 piece meal with mashed and coke, and 1-2 piece meal, leg and wing with mashed and coke.  Received 1 3 piece chicken strips with fries, with coke, and 1 2 piece meal with big hunk of white meat, and one leg with mashed and sprite.

Train your staff to LISTEN and get the order correct!  Didn't realize the mixup until we opened the bag at home, the strips (not ordered, were stale and definitely set on the shelf for some time.  Service mediocre, food poor, order correct- NOT!  won't be back.  Frustrating to get it home and anticipate our order and get something completely different."}
{"text":"Last night me and my friend went to Churches Drive through at 730pm we waited in line 30 minutes for our food and watched people inside hat arrives after us get their food before ours. We watched the girl working the drive up window and the register inside by herself. So when we got to the window to complain about the wait she responded \"Your attitude is not with me it's with the owner\" (granted she was correct) she was the only one to help us at the time so she was the only one that could explain what was happening once we gave this response she said technically I don't anymore because I just quit and removes her headset and walked away from the window so needless to say we never got our food and I will NEVER visit this location again"}
{"text":"Store has moved to a new, free-standing building on a pad in front of 99 Only; on Van Buren, just west of Central.
Clean, fast and friendly service. Love the Lemon pie and jalapeno bombers and of course the spicy chicken."}
{"text":"Being a fan of fried chicken, I wanted to give Church's a try.  

It has a good crunch, but no flavour, and the spicy is bland as well.

Popeye's spicy is still the best of the fried chicken franchises and better than a lot of restaurants too!"}
{"text":"We have tried a couple of other locations and always come back to this one. The manager is a really nice person.+1.
If you like fried chicken give this location a try. It is way above the others.
The only downside is that some of the staff don't understand my English accent at all."}
{"text":"worse ever!!!!...from the person in drive through taking the order all wrong waiting over 15 minutes to get ur food!!...never again will i come or recommend anyone to come here!!!"}
{"text":"Very slow drive-thru.... there were only two cars in front of us and we waited over 25 minutes. And then when we got to the window, the lady told us it would be another 10 more minutes for the SPICY chicken we had ordered. I asked why it was taking so long and they said they only had two cooks in the back. Pretty ridiculous for a 3-piece chicken tender strip meal."}
{"text":"For years, I have heard of Church's Chicken. There used to be more locations in the GTA, but I never truly got into fried chicken until now.

On Groupon, there are a few deals at two different Church's Chicken places. This location had a deal for two chicken sandwiches, two sides, and two drinks for $6. I decided to give it a try.

I didn't realize that this Church's location is at Cedarbrae Mall until I pulled into the lot. It brought back odd memories of my mom taking me to my orthodontist's Scarborough location in this mall to get teeth moulds. I was in grade 5, so it was an open parking lot where this chicken place now stands.

There is plenty of parking, although you do have to watch where you are going. Traffic can get a bit chaotic if you aren't paying attention and folks seemed confused at times.

I parked and walked in. Every table was taken at around 12:30 pm. There is limited seating. One person was ordering as I approached the counter. I showed my Groupon and then placed my order.

I got a BBQ chicken sandwich, a Tex Supreme chicken sandwich, corn, mashed potatoes, and two fountain drinks. I only had to pay for taxes, which came to $1.56. I gave the friendly person handling my order $2.05. He apologized and pulled out his calculator on his phone. I said that he owes me 50 cents. Wow. Our smartphones and technology are truly making us lazy with mind math.

My order didn't take long to process. I filled my beverage cups with Diet Coke and Barq's root beer. I got a couple of straw, which made me think that I should get recyclable straws.

I did takeout. I had the BBQ chicken sandwich. It had a nice crunch and the sesame bun was soft. I liked the barbeque sauce. It has iceberg lettuce, which I am starting to not like these days, likely because I have had an overdose of it. Other than that, it was a decent sandwich with a generous chicken breast that was juicy and nicely seasoned.

I ate the corn, which was one of my sides. It was on the cob. I loved it. I also had the mashed potatoes, which had a slight kick to it. It was comfort food in a small container.

I couldn't eat the other sandwich, so I had the Tex Supreme chicken sandwich for dinner. I liked the spicy mayo. It didn't have a ton of heat, but I enjoyed it. You get the same generous chicken breast on a sesame bun.

I would go back to have some fried chicken with honey-butter biscuits and macaroni salad. All of that is up my alley. The Groupon was a decent introduction to this chain and I want more.

{"text":"Awful.  Chicken was raw and manager argued about giving a refund because we ate a couple of spoons of the soupy mac-n-cheese.  The excuse for raw chicken was that they were \"in a hurry.\"  Subsequent calls to Church's management showed their antagonistic attitude towards customers.  We won't be eating there ever again."}
{"text":"Fast food? More like SLOW FOOD! 


Dang they are slow! This place isn't going to survive long if they keep their slow service going! And I always order the 14pc leg and thigh but they never offer the half gal of drinks they advertise. I hate ordering here but then again I like their chicken and biscuits."}
{"text":"Ordered the big 14piece tenders meal and half the batch still had the cartilages, purple veins inside. Called to complain and she said this was the first she has heard of this, and that she just checked the chicken none of them had it. I told her well I was unfortunate to be the lucky one with the bad chicken pieces with big purple veins. They had no jalapeño cheese dip when I went , she stated they'd been outta stock for two weeks. She asked if we could bring in the chicken, I guess she didn't believe me. I would have been more than happy to if I wasn't already a mom coming out of work rushing to get some dinner my kids and leaving our only car for my husband to go to work. So I was unable to bring the chicken in to get my money back. The manager or hand out lady a bit older on March, 14,2015 stated \"I don't know what you want me to do on the phone , which was hilarious to me if your in the business of customer service you should have something to figure out and not ask me - to give you the evidence. Churches is definitely going down hill. High prices for low quality food and service . She took my name down and phone number and basically that's all she did . Never going here again I'll just go to Raisin Canes on stapley. Which is sad because I grew up on churches"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to buy chicken! If you like tasty, crispy chicken...then come here! You MUST try the honey biscuits nom nom nom"}
{"text":"They say they have green beans on the menu yet they don't! The servers were slow and unfriendly. We purchased Mac and cheese and received no fork or spoon. I don't have much else to say except I don't plan on coming back!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, average to slightly above average in my opinion. It does seem a little overpriced for what you get. The best thing we do is try to take advantage of any coupons that are available. The help is usually pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Simply tooooo slow always a line, between orders cashier walk away and just ignore the next person. Bad manor when taking order"}
{"text":"What a joke. I went there after receiving a coupon in the mail. After waiting at the drive through window for 8 minutes the dumb Filipino lady finally asked me what I want and her accent was so strong I didn't even understand what she was saying. After ordering I proceeding through the drive-through line. After waiting another five minutes the dumb Filipino lady opened the window and told me they were out of chicken that it would be about 20 minutes until the chicken was ready."}
{"text":"I went here to get a family dinner paid $39.99, got home, and realized they gave me 12 pieces of chicken. I ordered 20. I called to let them know and the rude man on the phone tells me that i was only charged for 10. I paid $39.99 and you really think you only get 10 pieces of chicken. If you are going to run a restaurant know your menu and prices. I live 15 minutes away but i am going to get my 8 pieces of chicken."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is decent. A bit dry but good flavor. Mashed potatoes are really good. Coleslaw sucks. Biscuits are the bomb!!! They put a light glaze over them which adds a perfect sweetness to the soft warm center. 

We arrived around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and the dining room was already closed so we went through the drive through. There were three cars ahead of us and we waited for about 20 minutes. Twenty minutes in the drive through is a long time. Finally got our food, which was still nice and hot so we were okay. 

The \"more for $4.44\" deal is a good price. Two pieces of chicken with mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a biscuit for less than $5 with tax. No drink though."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Sometimes it's the best chicken you've ever had, sometimes it's a greasy mess with oddly shaped parts. Today i missed out. From burnt dried out macaroni and okra to small, dry yet still greasy pieces of chicken. At least the biscuit was good... of course I'll be back, but i feel a bit cheated out of my money this time."}
{"text":"I always have great experiences here. The food is cooked just right. The service is always great. Today for instance the car in front of mine made a huge order causing a slight delay for me. The cashier was so apologetic and even upgraded my meal without me even asking."}
{"text":"Love the spicy fried chicken and the honey biscuits but it's hit or miss as it relates to the freshness. Customer service needs to improve."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Church's Chicken. I got the chicken fingers with mac & cheese and a biscuit. I ordered the 3-piece but I ended up with 4. I thought they were alright. Better than Popeye's but nowhere near Raising Cane's. The baked mac & cheese was pretty good. The biscuit was cold and somewhat disappointing."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I've gotten a pissed off cashier all three times I've ordered from this location."}
{"text":"We came here before we headed over to Golf mart. I've been craving some Spicy fried chicken for a while and even though it was a Monday I still wanted some. Couldn't wait for The Tuesday special. Hardly any line because we were
So early. We ordered a spicy 3 piece combo which comes with a side and soda and biscuit. My hubby and I always share. They gave us a Wing, drumstick and a breast. We also got red beans and
Rice. The drumstick I are was good but it was so small. Must have been a small chicken. The red beans and rice is always good. They have that recipe down pat. The breast was too dry for me. You would think being so early In the Morning - about 11am - everything would be crispy And succulent. Don't get me wrong - I'll still eat at Popeyes but maybe try a different location."}
{"text":"I went in today and bought the shrimp and tenders and I when I opened the box there was 4 tiny pieces of shrimp in the box. No sauce for the shrimp."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick stop to get some strips to snack on throughout the night. It is definitely fast food like you'd expect. While I can't say it is bad, I also can't say it was good.

Next time I will stick to Cane's instead of using Church's."}
{"text":"Staff is not very friendly. Esp MARY! No smile, no thank you, the list can go on and on....in short very poor customer service! She works like she hates the job. The dining area is dirty. A mess everywhere. Totally not recommending this place for dining. Drive thru should be ok because you won't have to deal with the sight of dirty floor and tables."}
{"text":"At 10:15 on Thursday I stopped by because all the lights were on including the flashing \"OPEN\" sign. Pulled into the drive through and after repeated asking if they were open or if I could order still received no response. I pulled around to leave or see what was up and caught the curb. A one inch high curb that pointlessly separates the drive thru from parking with no paint to indicate its presence if you're not paying close attention. Tire popped and I park under the billboard at the edge of the parking lot. Staff all stared as I began changing my tire. Then, without asking if everything was okay or if I needed help, they turned off all the lights and left. Luckily the billboard provided light and had I chosen any other part of the lot I would have screwed. 

I don't know about their food, but the staff clearly doesn't care. If your lights are on, be prepared to say \"sorry we're closed\" or at least turn off the open sign! Then be a descent human being if someone gets stranded in your lot. What if I didn't have a spare and had to leave my car overnight? Would they have towed it away as trespassing?"}
{"text":"Horrible service to start off she asked me to repeat my order back to her and then chicken was dry like beef jerky but chicken jerky! Didn't get no napkins or utensils? Thought I was bringing dinner home to the family but ended up being a floss party"}
{"text":"One time I'm the drive thru waiting. I look in the window and I see a fire starting. No one noticed until I said something lmfao. They had to put it out with a fire extinguisher you just see a puff of white powder go flying everywhere. Pure comedy. I couldn't order that time because of the fire retardant being all over the chicken now but any ways, Im giving this place 5 stars because its Church's and its delicious."}
{"text":"It has been some time since I had patronage Churches Chicken and now I remember why. I ordered the chicken strips, fries and a drink. I ordered a mixture of original chicken and spicy chicken. Well, to be honest it was all bland, that was the taste I remembered and why I had not been back. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Love church's but the service here is a joke always slow, you would think at noon they would be prepared for lunch. The staff is always very impersonal and act put out to serve you. This location needs some serious help"}
{"text":"The worst service ever actually non service!!! My first time eating Church's chicken and I just sat in the drive thru for 12 minutes and no one ever came to take my order. They helped someone in front of me and there were people behind me so I was boxed in. I honked and yelled so they could hear me. I could hear them laughing and goofing off in the intercom but no help! I even tried calling and the phone rang for 2 minutes straight. I'm am so upset!! I will never go there again!!! 0 stars for this place!!!!"}
{"text":"So it's been a while since I've been to a Church's, this one recently opened in our 'hood. I think I know why I stayed away so long. 
We used the drive thru for our order. Service time was reasonable. Staff was friendly and answered our questions. We ended up ordering an 8 peice Mixed Chicken Special, we asked to make sure that it included 2 breasts since that's what my husband likes. LOL. They assured us it would.
Well there was one breast so my hubby got screwed but he is willing to eat dark meat too. We got the chicken original style, so we could gauge how good the chicken is without heat. Well it was moist inside; crunchy outside, not too greasy but utterly tasteless. The mashed potatoes and gravy were worse than school cafeteria potatoes. The coleslaw was okay. The biscuits are super small, but they were the best thing we had. $15 for that, I'm sad.
 I will not be returning. Popeye's and KFC are better by far and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"Cheap, consistent fried chicken. I have always had great customer service here. This has been my goto Church's for over 5 years... Sometimes tbe dining area is a little trashed, but i tally that to the customers, and not necessarily the employees, as when it slows diwn, i have seen them cone out and clean up.. Just when they are super busy..

Thats my 2c anyways.."}
{"text":"Yikes. This Church's only got business from me because of its location and because we had a coupon.

Customer service needs a lot of work. Walked in, no greeting. Walked up to order, still no greeting. Am I talking to a wall or what? I made sure to come inside to make sure they accepted my coupon and good thing I did. I showed my coupon (7pcs, 1 large side, and 4 biscuits for $9.99) and he punched it in. When I took my phone back, he asked \"How much was the coupon?\". He's lucky I'm a good person cus any other dishonest person could've lied...

Service was okay; maybe it seemed quicker because I was in the process of writing this review. But I wasn't paying attention until I heard \"order up!\" Like wut... am I supposed to respond to that? 

The one star is only because their chicken wasn't bad and I like the top part of the honey biscuit. Never will I go out of my way to come here, only because customer service is a key thing for me."}
{"text":"Been our Church's for over 15 years. The chicken here is quality with great sides. Love the specials they have including the summer special currently."}
{"text":"Location for me was good as I got china town frequently. I picked up at 10 piece mixed meal with half spicy and half original. I love the spicy chicken here. The chicken is usually about the same as other churches but this one seemed to have just a bit more heat in the spicy chicken. The inside as clean and the service was friendly. I'll more then likely be back"}
{"text":"I don't eat fried chicken very often, as a kid growing up in Texas, I remember my father having Church's once a week for lunch.  I would come in from school and he'd be at the table eating, reading his new paper, and there in the chair next to him, our family cat, waiting patiently for a nibble.  

So today while out and about town, my husband had a great idea, let's try Church's. The Louisiana chicken place by the house had closed for some time now, so it made sense to try it again.

Crunchy, juicy, hot out of the fryer, this chicken is delicious. I had a side of fried okra and enjoyed my meal.  I haven't had Church's in such a long time, I had forgotten how it tasted."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst run.  Last three visits I tried they were out of SPICY - so when I ordered again today I said I sure hope you are not out of spicy, and the cashier said \"oh well I'll have to check that.  And sure enough they were out.  

I asked, what would I know if I worked here as to why they are always out of spicy?

Cashier says \"that's because people don't order very much of it, they order the original white and dark more.\"

My logical response was.. \"they must be ordering it, if you are out of it.\" 

Cashier says... \"oh well I guess that's true.  

He proceeded to tell me, IF I WANT SPICY, CALL AHEAD NEXT TIME!

Wow!  Haha."}
{"text":"Good overall chicken. Everything else was rather bland! Oh yeah, bring lunch to wait for your lunch too! Service took for eveeeeeeeeer!"}
{"text":"I agree with another post I saw...why low ratings?!? For one thing cheaper than Popeyes and KFC...2nd the taste is actually better than both! They have a lot of sides choices and their honey biscuits are awesome! They frequently have both meal deals and chicken only deals. I really like this location because its clean and the line is fairly quick."}
{"text":"This is the worst location I have ever been to. The customer service is horrible, The guy that was in the drive-thru was so miserable and took forever to take an order. And their biscuits were not even baked correctly like the other locations there was no honey on them no butter no nothing. And with a three piece chicken strip dinner you don't have a choice of sides you have to get the sides that come with it this is the only location that does that. I would rather drive 10 miles then to come to this location again."}
{"text":"Drive through. Love the chicken strips, okra, and sweet tea! The window clerk was courteous, and efficient."}
{"text":"Being that we don't have this restaurant on maui, we decided to try it out. The restaurant was fairly clean and at the time we visited wasn't busy. We weren't greeted and the cashier Odalis wasn't friendly or helpful with item suggestions. The food was delicious, but disappointed my first visit here wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"Well, I decided to start the year off right. And go to Church. I have to admit I hadn't been to Church in quite awhile. Such a sin. I know. I didn't get all dressed up but I did do the sign of the cross when I entered Church's. Oh. I meant to say Church's earlier in the review. Not church. My bad. How silly. What a silly yelper am I? Church's. You know. Double battered fried chicken. Deep fried okra. Powderd mashed potatoes. And the mac n cheese. Why the latter is indeed heavenly. And a sin at the same time. I'm not gonna compare the grease sticks here to the grease sticks at KFC or Popeye's. All kinda the same to me. But I can tell you the offering from Church's soaked up the booze from ringing out 07 the night before. Grease be with you. And also with you."}
{"text":"This is the worst Church's in the valley! The window clerk/manager was so rude! He threw my credit card back into my face and closed the window when I asked to speak up as I could not hear him.  There were three cars behind me so he had to deal with me. I wanted to talk to the owner or file a police report. He slammed the window again after calling me an \"a-hole\"...I waited for my order over 20 minutes! So did the 3 cars behind me. I wasn't surprised to see all the low star ratings for this location. Seems I am not alone.
When it comes to churches you have options so avoid this location and the rude condescending treatment.
I complained to the corporate office in Atlanta. I am hoping for some resolution from them as this location hates it's customers.
Nothing here was embellished. This actually happened!
Shame on you Miguel! Shame."}
{"text":"I ordered TO GO 8 pcs Merry meal: legs and thighs only, with okra, fries and biscuits. What I received is: 4 breasts with wings (I don't like it!) and only 2 legs and 2 thighs. 
They packed fries and okra in plastic bags and when I got home (less than 5 minutes!!!) both were soaking wet from condensation- NASTY!! 
Okra tasted bitter as well. 
Biscuits were stale. 
No condiments offered at all. 
Poor customer service, we were not acknowledged or greeted at all!
Overall highly disappointed and upset!"}
{"text":"I stopped eating KFC after getting mild food poisoning from it the last 2 times, and there aren't a whole lot of options for fried chicken in North Phoenix, so I decided to make the 20 minute drive to this Church's, which has been at this location for at least 30 years (I believe). When the girl told me it would be about a 10 minute wait for chicken, I did not mind at all. They make fresh small batches, so waiting is good in this case. The chicken was nice and crunchy (I wish they seasoned it closer to KFC, but oh well). Mac and Cheese was very good, and their honey-butter biscuits are amazing. There were three people working and seemed to be mostly professional and efficient. One girl however, didn't acknowledge a customer that had just walked in. He stood there for several minutes and she ignored him until he said something to her. I don't care if you're busy, it is the easiest thing in the world to say, \"Hi, I'll be with you in a moment. \" Seriously, use your head!"}
{"text":"Tried them again, their serving sizes got a lot bigger. The chicken strips were actually strips this time and the food was fresh & hot. Service was a million times faster. I think they are ok, but their prices are a bit high still."}
{"text":"I was craving some fried chicken, and I hadn't been to a Church's since I was back in Alabama a few years back.  I signed up for their app and they instantly provide you with coupons.  The coupon was for 4 chicken strips, small fries and a biscuit for $3.99.  Not bad...not bad at all.  I drove down, got my food and took it back to work.  Here is how it was...........

Chicken Strips-  They were very tasty!  Church's uses a real light batter but it's still plenty crunchy and tasty.  My chicken strips were a little uneven though.  I had 2 giant strips and then 2 super skinny strips.  I guess they evened each other out, but if you got all 4 skinny strips, that would suck.  I got some honey mustard and honey BBQ for the dipping sauces.  They were both really good and worked well with the juicy chicken strips!

Small Fries-  Crinkle cut.  Salted well.  They were alright.

Biscuit-  My favorite part of the meal.  Church's kind of dips/glazes their biscuits in honey.  They have a slight crunch when you bite into them but then they are soft in the middle.  They are kind of in the shape of a large macaroon cookie.  The biscuit was very good!

Service was extremely fast and friendly.  Not sure how often I will be coming back down here, but if a chicken craving hits, I could definitely see myself coming back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what I wanted for lunch, so I was playing on my phone about to open the Yelp App and look for something to eat around work.  Right next to my Yelp App was my Church's Chicken App.  I had downloaded it awhile ago but it kind of gets lost in the shuffle.  They usually have pretty good coupons on the app and some chicken actually sounded good.  I browsed their coupons (download the app btw...it really does have good coupons!), and came across one that was for 5 pieces of chicken or strips, 2 small sides and 2 biscuits for only $6.00.  Score!   Drove down to this one since I hadn't been before, and decided to use the coupon.

When I pulled up, the first thing I noticed was that this was a tiny ass Church's!  No drive thru, real small storefront with maybe 5 tables total.  The place seemed a little run down, dingy and sad to say, kind of dirty!  The floor was sticky and you could see all the footprint marks on the ground.  The tables and chairs seemed coated with a film of years of old chicken grease lol.  I decided to place my order to go.  I went with 5 spicy strips, mac and cheese and mashed potatoes as my sides, and it came with the 2 biscuits.  Total was $6.51.  Can't beat the price!  Here is how the food was................

Spicy Strips-  These were very good!  They hooked me up with 5 nice sized strips.  They were freshly cooked, crunchy outside and moist inside.  They had a little kick to them, but they definitely weren't \"spicy\" per say.  Very good and I would definitely get them again!

Mac and Cheese-  Took the lid off and it didn't look too great.  One bite in though, and I was happily surprised.  It was very creamy and delicious.  Some of the cheese on top was almost even \"broiled\" so it added a nice texture.  Some of the better fast food mac and cheese I have sampled. I wouldn't have thought so by the initial look of it, but I would definitely get it again.

Mashed Potatoes-  Pretty simple and to the point.  Smooth, whipped potatoes, topped with a nice brown gravy.  Tasted very good.  Not as good as Popeye's mashed potatoes and gravy, but still very good.

Biscuits-  The biscuits today were just a tad \"off\".  They were hot and seemed fresh, but they were a bit hard today and seemed a little bit stale.  The flavor of them was not as buttery as past Church's biscuits either.  I ate them, but was not too impressed. 

Overall, it was a pretty good lunch.  I doubt I would come back to this specific one again (there is another one about a mile away on Peoria Ave which is better) because of the lack of drive thru and the grimy interior.  The food was good though and the cashier was friendly.  A-OK by me!"}
{"text":"It's like watching an episode of \"Cheater's\"

Or listening to talk radio.

Or peeing out by the dumpster because it's quicker than finding a bathroom.

Or going through the medicine cabinet at my friends hou...perhaps I've over-shared!

But you get the idea. 

It's a guilty \"pleasure\"...OK, I'm not sure \"Pleasure\" and Church's really go together (unless you really like rolling around in chicken fat, like I do...oop's! over-sharing again!)...more of a guilty \"thing\"

At any rate, I know I shouldn't, but there are times when only a bucket (or in Church's case, a box) of greasy fried chicken will do.

And when that happens, well...it's Church's instead of the 11 herbs and spices that theoretically go into KFC (or Kitchen Fresh Chicken...or Kentucky Fried Chicken, or whatever the hell they call themselves these days).

A bunch of people showed up for dinner tonight and Church's is the go-to for that kind of thing (at least it is when they all suggest I cook and I say \"thanks, no\" and they give me the \"eeew\" face when I suggest pizza).

As the consummate host, I reminded my guests that Church's:

 -  Has never given me the trot's, unlike KFC...important since it's my house and me lighting a match is \"optional\";

 - Is less expensive than KFC, since I'm buying the feast;

 - Goes well with pretty much any wine (OK, I made this last one up but, I figure they won't notice once they have drunk enough of my wine)

So Church's...perfectly average \"fried\" chicken, for cheap low prices.

Don't even try to tell me that you haven't done it, too!"}
{"text":"The only things I have tried here are the chicken strips and the okra. Chicken was good. Okra is better at Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Hit or miss...
Sometimes it's the best chicken you've ever tasted. Sometimes the chicken is raw and they refuse to refund you. There is zero consistency or happy medium."}
{"text":"I like their Chicken. I'm not gonna lie but the service is probably the worst that I've had in many years.  I was there for Lunch, around 1pm today February 20th 2015.  I've decided to go inside in person. The girl, a darker, short and sort of skinny girl was stocking some sauces but facing me. For 2 minutes not even a hello or a I'll be there with you.  Then she comes to the register but she has the headsets on, still not eye contact, says can I help you but just looking at the register and totally rude and grumpy.  I had to tell her. Are you talking to me?  And she says all rude yeah!  Still rude and not even looking at me.  Whatever I order my meal, give her my card and she says all rude. We dont take American Express. I was like, it would  be nice if you guys have a sign that way I'm not in line ordering food.  And she is like. Oh well!!!!!   This place sucks. Worst service ever"}
{"text":"We had a coupon ..had 12 pieces of chicken and a large jalapeno breaded cheese poppers..... as I drove home, The chicken had a really weird smell to it. Anyways the chicken LOOKED okay, had a bit of an ofd taste to it which wasn't obvious. .i was scared so didn't eat anymore. Was it dirty chicken, why did it smell like actual chicken? Yuck. The jalpeno poppers were really good....but the chicken? DIRTY?"}
{"text":"So not much has changed in the last year and a half at this Church's.... We're still there all the time, they still have good chicken, and the building is still nice and cold. In my 2.5 years of coming here have never really had any problems... I think the worst thing that had happened was when they were out of boneless wings. Which does kinda stink because they're great.... which by the way order 3 sets of the 3 boneless for less than the 6 boneless cost... just sayin ;)"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. I have been sitting in the front of the restaraunt for 20 minutes waiting for our order."}
{"text":"First of all, I ordered a grande chicken meal which comes with a quart sweet tea. We pull up to the window in which I was informed they ran out of sweet tea quarts, but said they can do 2 large cups in place of it. LOL! Two seconds later, she came back to the window and asked if she can just give us sugar since they \"ran out\" of sweet tea! What the? It's the dinner rush and you're already out of sweet tea? We asked how long it would take to get it brewed and she said \"5 minutes\"... and to park in the front. We pull around to the front and of course no sign of parking! 15 minutes later, the cashier comes outside with the food along with 2 large cups of sweet tea LOL! I was like, \"Wow! I wasn't able to get the quart since a new batch was made?\" Her response... \"We ran out of the containers too!\" Lmaoooooo!!! SMH!!! We looked in the bag (after she walked away) and the biscuits were missing that was ordered on the side! Ugggghhhhhhh!! We went back thru the drive thru since there were no cars and ordered 6 biscuits! We pulled up to the window (a new cashier) and I handed him my receipt and said my biscuits were missing! His face got all SOUR as if it was MY fault the biscuits jumped out of the bag! We could see him thru the window stuffing 6 biscuits into the bag as if he wanted them to break apart! 

NEVER AGAIN AT THIS LOCATION!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm....I actually forget what day I came here, but they had the delivery truck unloading late at night when I came by. First of all...this place probably has the worst drive-through path. Since the delivery truck was here at the time of my visit, I could not hear/understand the person on the intercom. Pulled over to the front and the food I wanted to order was not the amount of chicken I expected nor the same price that was on their website. The staff said that the websites are behind and they don't get updated right away. Ugh!!! So...I just left.

Horrible, HORRIBLE experience! I don't even want to give this place any star."}
{"text":"Waited in line on a Thursday night for over 15 minutes before I could order. I would have left but I had another car behind me"}
{"text":"Ooops, bad experience here with Churchs and I usually like their chicken. Came in about 830pm (only customers there) and there was a mountain of chicken in the warming tray. Asked the cashier if it had been sitting for long and he assured me that it hadn't. But our dinners came and sure enough the chicken was hard and only semi warm. It was actually pretty disgusting when I do enjoy their chicken normally. Also the restroom was thoroughly soaked with bleach water on everything in there. Good chicken horrible execution. Don't think I'll come back to this location again."}
{"text":"We've always frequented church's from TX to AZ and prefer it over the other fried chicken places. But the service at this location is INSANELY TERRIBLE. Church's itself deserve 5 stars but this location is 0 stars. 

The manager at this location is always there with her little grumpy attitude 24/7. She's also a sauce nazi. Ordered a big family meal (10+ chicken)... could I please get some creamy jalapeño sauce?  \"Sigh\" you can only get one, do you want it?\" 
Uhh as if I'm going to say.. no I can't then. My family will have to fight it out on who gets the one sauce... DUH lady give me it. Either church's theirselves have strict sauce policies or she just likes to take it home at night to bathe in it."}
{"text":"Church's has way better food than KFC, in both selection and flavor, not to mention a better price.
This one is a small store that gets busy, so they are a little slow at times.
The crew at this Church's is hard working, and there are never any quality issues.
The honey-butter biscuits are better than the other guy's too, but they recently stopped having packets of honey available for dripping over them (they say they have more honey cooked onto the biscuit now)."}
{"text":"I don't know if you've heard but they came out with a new Chicken . I would tell you the name of it or upload a picture but I devoured it already , absolutely no evidence remaining ! I went earlier today to try it out not knowing what it taste like , man was it bomb! I didn't want to seem like a pig and go get some more right away so I waited until I knew they had a shift change and I wouldn't be recognized. I just got home filled with nothing but hunger and regret ...guess what happened...THEY RAN OUT OF MY NEW NOW FAVORITE CHICKEN !! Who does that ? What chicken place runs out of chicken ?! The word chicken is in the name of the place ! Now I have to reminisce on my earlier meal, hopefully that will fill my belly ."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times and it seems that everytime you go in there the manager has an attitude problem. This particular day last week I visited and she was talking very rude and disrespectful to a customer. Some of them should have customer service training! The food was horrible this day as well. Its hit or miss. Some times its good some times its bad tasting."}
{"text":"Can't really never go wrong with Church's! Look for their daily deals to save a few bucks. I would choose Church's over Popeye's. Although we don't go here a lot(because it's super greasy) lol A family meal usually pops up on the kitchen table at least once a month. Haha 
After writing this review I now am craving their chicken. Time to go now!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it's alright. Like Ryan mentioned, it's better than KFC.

Anyway, that's where the compliments stop. The people who dine here have to be the trashiest on the West side of Phoenix. And by trashy, I mean they leave their trash EVERYWHERE in this area! I've seen empty cups, chicken bones and carryout bags all along 35th Ave and Cactus. You'll always see it in front of Moon Valley High School, too. It's pretty obvious to spot given Church's logo. Fuck this place and its litterbug patrons."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. Waited exactly 12 minutes in the drive thru with just one car ahead of me. Ordered spicy strips with medium mashed potatoes. Got my food after a long wait and had to eat it on my way to work. Turns out they gave me extremely undercooked raw soggy regular strips and a small mashed potatoes without gravy. So irritating to spend your money on food that is not even edible. You think for as long as I waited the food would atleast be cooked properly. I will never give that location another dime!"}
{"text":"I love Churches Chicken but I hate going to this location. Every time its the same thing. They get our order incorrect, the cashier is rude and doesn't ask if you need any sauces or condiments. The Mac and cheese is ALWAYS horrible here, I think they cook it with spoiled milk or something so definitely stay away from that. EVERYTIME our order is wrong and when we go back to get our missing food, they're impolite and just throw it in a bag and give it to you with no apology or anything. Worst customer service and Mac n cheese ever."}
{"text":"This morning went to church chicken and we ordered 20 pcs spicy. We have to wait 20-30 minutes to be ready,  we know we bit early.  The staff inform us that we can order before we arrived so we don't need to wait. That is nice touch!  
Their chicken different from other places,  their chicken much more bigger, juicier and more tastier. 
But so sad the location is bit far from our place but worth to drive and fight for looking the parking in St Clair Toronto."}
{"text":"The chicken is good...the service on the other hand not so much.  I've been here about three times since moving to Charlotte and I've had three different cashiers.  Okay every cashier gets my order wrong.  They repeat what you say about 10 times (not sure why they can't maintain the information and type it in as you're ordering...guess it's too much to ask for) then type it in wrong and it comes out wrong.
For this I definitely recommend not going through the drive through.  You'll be home by the time you realized that this is not your order at all or you didn't' get what you paid for.  The place doesn't look that clean also (it's on the old side) and again....service (well...)
It's not that their rude or anything like (some not all) just kinda...well how can I put it...dumb (sorry)"}
{"text":"This fried chicken is really good, it is very full, but when the order is taken, the waiter mistakes lead me to buy a big one. Although it is delicious, it is not so beautiful."}
{"text":"So I'd never been to a Church's before, but got a flier and the bourbon chicken looked good so I wanted to try it.  First time, it was about 7:30 pm last week and they were out of this chicken!  I therefore had to wait in the drive thru for some time, having ordered nothing.  

After that annoying waste of time and gas, I decided to call and make sure they had this advertised chicken before going there.  No one was answering, but I ran errands while I kept calling. Someone finally answered 25 minutes into calling, I asked about the chicken and he said they had it. Within 10 minutes, I was at the drive thru asking for 2 bourbon half chickens. His reply was that he only had one half chicken left, until he made more. I said I had called to make sure they had this chicken before driving over, his response was unapologetic and said it would take 20 minutes to make more. Should've told me that when I called!! 

I said to just give me the half he had, which seemed to surprise him..not sure why.  I ordered it with fried okra and a biscuit. When I get my order, I check it before driving off and there's the okra...there's the biscuit...but there's NO CHICKEN!!!  Are you fuckin kidding me?!  So here I am honking to get their attention to get the half.chicken I paid for. I would've been so angry if I had not checked and gotten home, after all that, with okra and a damn biscuit and no chicken!! This place is ridiculous"}
{"text":"Sat in drive through and ordered. When I reached the window, woman seemed nice enough, took my card and ran it. Took her a few minutes to bring me back my card. When she came back with it, she was giggling and told me there was a sign on the drive thru menu that stated they were taking cash only as their card services were down. Not only was there no such sign, but why in the world would she take my card to run it if she already knew there was a problem? Funny because it was my first time coming back in about 12 years because I had a hankering for some fried okra. Maybe I'll give them another chance in 12 years or so."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place less than 1 star.....THEY SERVED ME RAW CHICKEN STRIPS!!!!! This churches is horrible find another! YUCK!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time in today. First impression was how sticky the floor was. With every step my shoes felt glued to floor. The place was a little dirty on the tables. Only three staff members on. One peeping food in the back one at register and one possibly in charge at drive through. Ordered my meal the wait was a little longer than expected chicken was done and sitting in basket on tray at counter but had to wait for a fresh batch of fries. About 7 minutes. So the meal itself blah not that great. Chicken was just not appealing at all Canes blows this dump away. The best part of the meal was the fries I had to wait 7 mins for. The biscuit was sub par as well. While waiting for my meal I watched another patron come to order get so frustrated with the counter help he turned and walked off and left. Should have followed him out. Don't waste your time and pass on by this place unless your looking for a semi decent fry and soft drink. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was the worse service I've had at a fast food store.  I had a large potato/gravy. I asked for more gravy the manager said it's $.50 for more it only comes with 1 scoop. Which is funny had I ordered a small that 1 scoop would of been enough gravy.  The people behind me said they didn't get everything. The manager looked at the receipt and said \"nope you have everything, have a good day\" and shoved the tray toward them. Never go to churches chicken again. Bad service."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken tenders and biscuits.  I also like the fish combo they have for Lent.

Lobby was nice and clean."}
{"text":"I went to this church's September 12th around 6pm. I received horrible service and was blatantly disrespected. I went through the drive through window and a young women let me place my order and then asked me to come to the window. When I arrived at the window this women tells Me she didn't take my order.

So this women let me tell her my entire order and was not listening to me. I am so pissed off. It does not end there. I proceeded to tell the women my order again, for a second time.  I have to wait until they get my order straight. I get my order and the girl apologized.

I get home and my order was wrong. I was missing food. I had to go back to this location. When I get there I went into this location. The young women that initially helped me looked scared to see me back, but she knew she screwed up. She gave me the food they forgot to give me and said I am sorry. I asked to speak with the manager. 

This women walks over to the manger and let's her know. The manager proceeds to take a order. She didn't acknowledge me or say she would be right with me. So this manager turns around with an attitude, and the look on her face, was like she didn't care  about the service I have received.

I was so pissed off. This women cut me off and I told her as a manager she should of apologized for the service I received. Not look at me like you don't give a shit. She gave me a half ass I am sorry and proceeded to rudely cut me off and started talking to my niece who was with me, that was in my face blatantly disrespectful. She just ignored me.

I work in the service industry and I would never treat a customer this way.  I have never been treated like this. I am going to call church's corporate office and let them know about the service I received and they need to hold this store and it's workers accountable. I can only image the service people get here. I will not be back to this location and I will NOT recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with churches crispy chicken. The brought back a dipping sauce that i used to have as a kid, the purple pepper sauce. You have to try it with the chicken tenders they are delicious"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews for fast food but when I do it'll be for fried chicken. Let me start off by confessing I'm a recent Popeyes convert. I've told some of my friends but everybody doesn't know yet. The chicken is definitely more crispy and the spicy seasoning more pronounced. You don't need Cajun sprinkle but Texas Pete's hits the spot. You may be thinking why I give you this location two stars? At least three of my last five visits something is missing or messed up on the order. To top it off they never seem to have apple pies ready to go. Those things are like crack and on this corner I dont see how they couldnt be selling them like crazy. I can smell it in the air when I'm nearby and it just draws me in. Why can't they have em cookin or keeping them warm under hot lamps. The frost icing on top is literally the icing on the cake. Mickey d's doesnt do that and I dont even know if Popeyes or KFC has apple pies but these are memorable and its sad when they dont have it. Yes I know its empty calories carbs and it nots good for you but its not like I was expecting a healthy meal from Churchs right?"}
{"text":"They get a bad rep for being slow.... It's true. Although, you need to take into account that:

1. Drive thru line is long bc of the cheap deals

2. Bunch of the workers are HS or college kids. Who does not give a... 

3. I went inside to get my chicken- saw 3 workers (1 I believe is the mgr). 3 workers manning the dinner rush?! Crazy.... 

Meh, whateva... Ppl love to rant and complain, everyone likes to be pampered, everyone is in a rush to nowhere. lol

Despite that fact- you can't knock the super cheap price for decent fried chicken. It's not better than Popeyes but I rather have Church's lightly battered chicken than KFC's more expensive and heavily battered chicken.

Tip: reheat in your toaster oven for a bit once you get home. Just wait for it! It'll be worth it. That crispy bite (!) and the waffles will be nice and toasty too! It's not roscoes but hey! It's not bad! Don't knock it til you try it!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 45 minutes. Horrible experience. The speaker at the drive-thru doesn't work. The guys couldn't/wouldn't take our order. So, after the 45 minute wait we still have to place our order. Smells like pee also. Save yourself the time and headache go to KFC."}
{"text":"Super hot chicken and drive through it used to be Rally's ... Popper are crispy and hot love hot sauce and fried chicken. It
Must be a southern thing. Fast Service and inexpensive artery clogging good."}
{"text":"Negative stars for this Church's Chicken location. Your lobby is \"closed for repair\" and in the drive thru the handwritten paper sign says that they are out of 
Mashed potatoes
Cajun rice
Corn
Macaroni and cheese

When placing our order the girl says \"oh sorry busy weekend\" like that's an excuse. Who does your purchasing and why don't they pay attention to the needs / business demands of your customers?"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Wasted my lunch break. Didn't get what I ordered. Chicken wasn't cooked all the way. I was the only one in the drive thru and had to wait 20 mins for something I didn't order. Couldn't raise issue because I had to get back to work. Horrible. Annoyed. Not going back. And I will tell everyone at work not to go here either."}
{"text":"I just found a big ass bug  in my 4 piece tender!!! Don't eat here this place and people who work there are disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"order our food at 6:40 15pc meal half spicy half regular with 3 family sides potatoes, cole slaw, mac and cheese and lg drink $40. was told 5 minutes later it would be 8  minutes. watched others come in and leave with their large meals thought nothing of it. finally after 10 or so minutes when up to the counter and they said their oven broke cant get you mac n cheese we got poppers. then they said don't have any biscuits left for you either. at that point I asked for my money back and was going elsewhere. I looked over and saw biscuits and asked what about those. she didn't see those and gave them to us fine. then i asked how we know the difference between the spicy and the regular she said she isn't sure she didn't pack it looks at the kid next to her and he said I didn't put spicy in there. we said never mind were leaving after 25 minutes we got home and it was so greasy the box fell apart. Needless to say we went back out and got another dinner. I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"What a bad experience got to the restaurant store was dirty didn't mind it may appear to be busy order the 20-piece strip meal waited 25 minutes to receive just to find out they were literally pink and raw in the middle."}
{"text":"I know why they call it churches. It's because every time I eat there the deliciousness makes me praise god."}
{"text":"i went there last week...2nd week open they will need some time...the crew has not been fully trained...the cashier has no idea how the chicken is made..hand dipped, buttermilk, double dipped etc...thats a management problem
i love the biscuits but they are way too small, the coleslaw was good but my special order was 1 breast 1 leg and shades of kfc the chicken has 4 breasts with ribs and spine attached...ugh that being exactly why i no longer eat at kfc...add to that cooking A breast that has been cut in half changes the cooking time for the rib spine section which means the meat is so dry and overcooked u will choke on it even with your drink. hopefully this manager will take the time to have staff properly trained and get full breasts and not cheap it out will give them a second chance in about a month"}
{"text":"God freakin awful!!
There were four tables and three of them were filthy, thats never a good sign.  The staff was friendly but the chicken tenders were fried too light, the chicken was salty, and the rest of the sides left a lot to be desired.  I now understand why the ones in my hometown all closed."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and the first time i asked for no pickles i still ended up with them on my sandwich, after making them aware they then handed me a sandwich with the pickles taken off by hand. Now on my second go round i ordered the same things only to be given a chicken sandwhich with a processed chicken patty they see of my palm which is not very big... overall disappointed with there service and the food has really gone down hill. DONT GO HERE"}
{"text":"Im a huge Popeyes chicken fan so it kills me to say this chicken is just slightly better in my opinion. 

The biscuits here are an acquired taste im not sure I like. They are honey glazed. Popeye's definitely has them beat on biscuits and sides. 

I may just have to go there to grab a red beans and rice, some biscuits and a mountain dew from the gas station so I can have a proper fried chicken lunch! 

Its worth a stop in and the customer service is improving since their first week open. I wish them nothing but success."}
{"text":"Attempted to use drive thru, after 5 minute left without order.  Must be understaffed but it wasn't busy???  Poor customer service."}
{"text":"Have come to this location twice now and was happily surprised that both times I ordered here, the chicken came out fresh and juicy and the biscuits were to die for. Most places you get dried out chicken that has been sitting under the heat lamp for a while, not the case here. Hopefully any future visits here, I get the same results!"}
{"text":"I eat at this location very often because the food is always perfect. But today when I went in I was disappointed. There were two kids In the lobby that went into the kitchen and started helping prepare food. They were in regular clothes, they were not wearing gloves while handling the food areas and in the kitchen, and they certainly were not of working age. I had already ordered before they went in there or else I wouldn't have ordered in the first place. The whole thing seems so unsanitary and I will not be back. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Bad customer  service. Marie and Diego were rude and unprofessional. Will not return  to this location"}
{"text":"I walked in last week and asked to place four orders of 20 piece mixed, one 10 piece dinner and one order for me to eat while there. Oh and 8 orders of the 5 jalapenos for $1.something.

The cashier walked to the back after explaining to me, he had to talk to his manager. She came up front with a pleasant demeanor and explained as long as I didn't mind waiting 30 minutes, that they would be able to complete my order.

My order was cooked fresh and they pushed it out fast. All the while, they servicied other customers and had their orders ready in a timely manner.

They were polite and courteous and very helpful. They did suggest that if I have a big order for the future that I can call it in ahead of time. But none the less, they serviced my needs and provided great excellent service.

The chicken was hot and fresh and everyone at my job was a happy camper. And as I happily munched away on fried okra while waiting for my chicken, I was a happy camper myself."}
{"text":"worst service EVER. why hasnt this placed closed? why is it still open?? 
never get my order right worst service"}
{"text":"This is the worst churches chicken in Las Vegas. They're the most disrespectful non-caring employees. Yesterday 9.13.17 about 4:30pm, none of the employees was wearing gloves when handling money and food, the restaurant is completely filthy. I came to this location a few times before because it was a new location. But every time I go they don't have something that's being advertising on the menu. And the employees are just rude. The food is never hot, it's like they're serving you food that's been sitting there all day. And when you kindly ask them to make it fresh they have an attitude or they will say no. The manager is never available, and the owner always seem to never order enough food to accommodate the demand. Please, I ask you all don't eat at this location. Popeyes is you best choice. I hate KFC but I would consider that before Churches again."}
{"text":"Will never go back.  I had a High School discount card I bought from my nephew and tried to use it there for a BOGO combo offer and the guy at the drive-in window said they don't accept those.  I said, \"It says it's good at ALL Las Vegas locations??\"  to which I hear in the background from the rude manager, \"We don't do that!\"  He wouldn't even come to the window to tell me directly!  I should have drove off, but Nooooo... I waited about 10-15 minutes at the window for my food, with cars behind me honking their horns!  Finally get home and NO SAUCE!  And the food isn't that great either.  Just makes me love Cane's that much more!"}
{"text":"Although I've been to this location several times, last night was the final time I'm going to this restaurant. Only 3 pieces of spicy chicken left to fill my 10-piece order. And none of it tasted fresh. The mac and cheese was good, and the fried okra wasn't bad. But, man, that chicken was vile!

The crew here seems to be mastering the skill of the vacant stare."}
{"text":"Overall good service when I come here!!   Food was hot & good!!    I would come again & recommend to a friend :-) 

I ordered the 2 piece mixed special for $2.99."}
{"text":"Boy oh boy!...What a BIG disappointment from the last time I visited a Church's. We went to the one in Chandler and ordered the 12 piece family dinner with a coupon I received in the mail for $16.99. It included 12 legs and thighs OR 12 tender strips, large mashed potatoes, large Cole slaw and 4 biscuits. Sounds like a good deal doesn't it?  Keep reading...First the chicken..The pieces were of decent size (bigger than KFC) but was absolutely flavorless..the meat AND the crust and really greasy. I got a bad stomach ache later. The large mashed potatoes is notably smaller now and has the gravy on top so the first 2 scoops get all the gravy. The Cole slaw is cut in larger chunks now than I remember and also markedly smaller in portion size. Now for the biscuits...way way smaller now, about the size of a golf ball and about 2 small bites is all you get. What a rip off even with the coupon included. I can only assume they are all like this now unfortunately. But on the brighter side I got a free stomach ache.  The total amount paid for all this pleasure with tax was $18.38. Since it was a to go order I asked for some paper plates and received small paper boats...like the kind made for french fries and some 3 inch flimsy toy like plastic sporks. I could only laugh at that point.  Last visit to Church's but I wish it wasn't!  Sad"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, chicken wasn't too bad and wasn't greasy or cold. Used 2 coupons, one for 4 chicken tenders and a biscuit ($3.99) one for 5 pieces legs and thighs, 2 sides (got mashed potatoes and gravy and cole slaw) and 2 biscuits. ( $5.99) Asked for all thighs no problem. Everything was hot and correct. Only problem was the taste of the chicken...very bland. Applied liberal amounts of garlic salt and lemon pepper it helped somewhat also the tenders are kinda dry and pale looking. I think if you cook the all white meat tenders to a crisp golden brown the meat will be way over cooked. Hence the paleness. In all fairness not bad for $10 and change and fed 3 hungry adults."}
{"text":"You truly can never go wrong with Church's Fried Chicken.  Is it healthy? Nope, but man, is it good.  Their flavor for the chicken is just so consistent every time and so tasty.  Their mashed potatoes are also great along with the fried okra.  The corn has always been bad every time we buy it...it always looks so good, but every time, it's bland and soggy.  There is a girl that works there that is quite obnoxious.  She's loud, talks to herself, and talks randomly to people with the strangest remarks.  Though she's happy...you can clearly tell her co-workers can't stand her.  Poor girl.  Anyway, for the few times we get CFC, it beats out any other fried chicken place such as KFC or Popeye's."}
{"text":"So was in the area again and in the need of lunch. Started to think the excellent food I received the first time around was a fluke.  One car in the parking lot, one car in the drive thru. On a Friday at noon, it's almost unheard off.

They have a special, 2 pieces of chicken, small mash, small coleslaw, one biscuit and one pepper all for $4.44. I asked for all white and he didn't up charge me. A small breast, one very large wing later and I was on my way. 

It wasn't a fluke! The food was every bit as good the 2nd go around and the gentleman that took my order and packed it was A+.

I have a feeling I am going to get addicted to this place!"}

{"text":"I was in the St Clair/Dufferin area for work with a coworker and we needed something relatively fast for our lunch break. Church's Chicken? Why not! Looked pretty tasty and the Tuesday special of two pc chicken and a biscuit for 4 bucks seemed pretty decent.

chirch's chicken reminds me a lot of Popeye's Chicken, which is tops for fast food chicken in my book. I got the spicy here, but sadly there wasn't much of a kick. The skin/batter was super crunchy and I love it. Taste-wise it's on the bland side. It was very tender and moist inside though.

It came with a small buttermilk biscuit glazed with a bit of honey. 

Considering I don't see this chain around much, I wouldn't go out of my way to get it.  Their daily specials are pretty reasonable though and I wouldn't mind having it again if ever I was in the area."}
