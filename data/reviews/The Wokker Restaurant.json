{"text":"Just goes to show that you should always trust your intuition. Empty Chinese restaurant next door to bustling Thai + Vietnamese restaurant. If I had more time I would have waited for a table at Spoon & Fork Thai & Vietnamese. As it was, I needed something quick and this fit the bill.   Unfortunately, this is a spot that should really just offer take-out. While clean and friendly, the food is on par with Manchu-Wok. To be fair I had a dinner special, Crispy Beef. It came with a vegetarian spring roll, yawn. I ordered egg drop soup. You should not be able to ruin it, but mine came dangerously close...really...really close. The beef was much too sweet and where were the vegetables.  For $20, no wine, you would have expected a bit better. Next time I will drive a few more minutes to the mall to be equally disappointed or just wait to find out how Thai + Vietnamese makes sense for so many people on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"The Wokker is the best, most authentic Chinese food you can find in Mississauga for take-out or dining in. I've been to countless Chinese restaurants in the area, and the food here is top notch without contest. Whenever I'm craving Chinese, I always come here - the staff is great, the food is awesome."}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery from this restaurant for years. Tonight the manager made a mistake and assumed we'd come to pick it up, even though he confirmed my address and the words ''I will pick it up'' did not come up in sequence or individually during our 2 minute telephone conversation. I was given a price and an estimated delivery time of 25 minutes. The manager called back after 30 minutes to ask why I hadn't come to pick up the order. The error was cleared up and I was told the food was on its way. It arrived 20 minutes later with a different price than I was quoted. I called the manager to ask why the price difference and he blamed me for the mistake and hung up on me. Now we have expensive, cold food and a bad taste in our mouths - figuratively and literally. Odd customer service methodology in a town with tons of good restaurants."}
{"text":"Terrible. Hardly authentic. The knife and fork table settings should have been enough to warn me to stay away. Came here for a quick dinner and ordered the Cantonese chow mein with chicken and shrimp, as well as pineapple and tomato fried rice as I was feeling nostalgic. Both were absolutely terrible!  First of all, the portion sizes are small. The server suggested we get the regular size so that we could share. What came out was a small dinner plate that could have passed for a single serving.   Now onto the food. The chow mein was ok. The vegetables were definitely fresh and numerous, but the shrimp was soggy. Definitely not enough noodles in the dish. The fried rice was a joke. Not only was there diced tomatoes in it instead of a tomato sauce, the whole dish was bland! It tasted like I was eating plain white rice. As for the pineapple? You'd think you could taste the sweetness, even if it was canned. Nope, the pineapple had NO FLAVOUR whatsoever, making suspect that they store it in water. The chicken chunks were few and very dry.   All in all, will never return here again, even if I'm desperate for Chinese food. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere. Even Chinese fast food from food courts taste better than this."}
{"text":"After looking at positive reviews, decided to give it a go. Highly disappointed with the food quality. Ordered sweet and sour chicken \"lunch special\" and it was the worst I ever had. Feel like wasted $9. There are plenty of better places around. Save your money don't bother going  here."}
{"text":"The Wokker is my favourite Chinese delivery place. Their food is a cut above your run of the mill Chinese delivery and take out restaurants. People on the phone are professional, courteous and speak English well. But it's the food that makes this place. Best quality Chinese delivery I have had, seriously."}
{"text":"I was here with some coworkers for lunch and  I would say the food was not bad.  The service was a bit slow but the server was friendly. The restaurant is pretty nicely decorated.   I ordered their chilli chicken and it was indeed a good choice....The food was hot and tasty and they had used large pieces of chicken not too breaded and can be enjoyed properly. The quantity was quite good and you won't feel bloated.   Decent food---lot of choices on the menu!   For my Muslim bothers and sisters - they serve halal meat mentioned on their site and stated on their door."}
{"text":"I ordered manchrurian chicken and wonton soup for lunch today and was really happy with the taste and quality. Meat pieces were big and most dishes could serve atleast 2 people. Only downside is rice is usually extra in the side. Fast delivery as well if you work around the area."}
{"text":"We visited Toronto and stayed at the Hampton. It is an easy walk to this restaurant. It is an unassuming building structure, but make no mistake - delicious food is served here. The staff were helpful and efficient. I have an egg allergy and they accommodated it. I would go back the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Got a quick take out a few days ago. First thing....it smelled terrific!! When i dug in, it tasted as good as it smelled.  When i try a new place, I usually just get my typical staple, beef chow mein. From that, I'll judge whether or not I'd want to go back and try other things too. Three important factors for me in choosing the beef chow mein. 1) the beef. Is is chewy and fatty, or tender and yummy? 2) is there enough veg? and 3) the sauce, flavour and quantity. For The Wokker it passed all three. The beef was good, there were lots of veggies (I hate when it's just onions and a few sparse carrots. There were tons of peppers, broccoli, and water chestnuts too!) and the sauce was soooo yummy. I'll admit it, my quilty pleasure is sipping a little of the sauce at the end of the bowl when it's gone cold. Mmm.... cold salty garlic-y sauce.  I'd try this place again."}
{"text":"Like below, it's a decent place with good price for food. I'm glad we came here instead of the bar across the street that didn't serve us for 10 mins.  For about $7-10 you can get a dish, with steamed rice and a veggie spring roll.  I gott he crsipy beef ($9.75) and it was quite good.  Everything else on the menu (not lunch special) was quite expensive.   When we came in, a few of the tables weren't clean, but they had enough seating for everyone.   The lighting was a bit dim. The wait staff was normal, nothing special."}
{"text":"Ordered a hot and sour soup and Szechuan beef for delivery to a nearby hotel. Delivery was fast and the guy was friendly. Food arrived pretty hot. Soup was not good at all. Neither hot, nor sour. More like a tofu and tomato soup. Beef was completely boring and faaaar away from tasting like Chinese food. Last but not least, the rice that I paid for came with a piece of plastic in it.  Overall a waste of money."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. This is a nice little restaurant. Nothing too fancy, but it was nice and clean. This is a great place for a group or corporate lunch/dinner.  I had the Szechuan Jumbo Shrimps. It was good but I wish it had a little bit more flavor as it was a bit on the bland side."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I have only had take-out from this place, but the past two visits have been exceptional. It was also nice to see the \"voice\" I order from and he's very nice. The food was amazing. Super flavourful, fresh, and the meat is of good quality. I've tried the curry beef chow mein, the kung pao beef, and the shanghai noodles; they were all amazing!  I cannot wait to try another set of dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"We ordered the Cantonese style chow mien and the lemon chicken dish for the lunch special(ends at 4pm but one online place said 5pm) We also ordered the chicken stickers. All of it was very good. My wife and I enjoyed it a lot. Its always a nice surprise when a place exceeds your expectations. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"ORDER In (Delivery) Review  I discovered this place from the front desk of the airport hotel and they recommended it highly. I called to place my order for Delivery to my room. They were very accommodating.  Won Ton Soup - nice broth and tender won tons.  Chicken with Diced vegetables and Cashews - again, fresh vegetables were used, and good sized pieces of chicken.  Crispy Beef - much like a Ginger Beef, nice serving of Beef with a sweet chilli sauce. Very tasty.  Broccoli in Garlic sauce - came with peppers,Onions , Broccoli was not over done.  All in all for Delivery , this was really good. I am used to going to Authentic Asian in Vancouver. This hit the spot, and they also sent me a nice tub of Chilli Oil because I like it Hot."}
{"text":"This place was our saving grace! We were stuck during the blizzard at our hotel and couldn't get a flight home. There was literally just a Tim Horton's and a Hero Burger with a gas station and we went to all three on the first day. We were lucky that with the storm Wokker Restaurant still delivered to our hotel. The food was average and the menu was a little complicated at first, but it didn't matter to us. We still enjoyed the food very much and appreciated the driver battling the ice to deliver. This review would have been a five star, but the food was just okay. All their items are a la carte so you have to order your proteins and your rice separately. Wish they had a combo meal with fried rice and meats like most restaurants."}
{"text":"I had some good spicy vegetables here. The staff was very friendly. They bring plate warmers to the tables to keep the dishes warm, which is nice. They have Chinese beer, other cocktails and such. I feel the prices were higher than other Chinese restaurants. The atmosphere is calmer and quieter than average, but the food is par."}
{"text":"In Toronto on business. Ordered for room service. Let's just say the flavor was lacking taste and just overall, not good. Ordered a few dishes to have left overs for the next night. Ate a couple bites of each dish and decided to toss all of it. I love chinese food but this is not good. I would never eat here again. Maybe you will like it but if you don't ....You were warned."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food we've ever had. Clean and pleasant atmosphere. reasonable prices and good service. Small but charming place. Very generous portions."}
{"text":"I had lunch at The Wokker the other day with a couple of my friends and I have to say that we were all quite impressed.  First, the interior is not your typical Chinese restaurant. Rather, it's a quaint, cozy little spot with tables, booths and white table clothes. Although the lunch crowd was beginning to pick up, the service was fairly quick so good for those who need to get back to the office. The menu is extensive and would be great for a group if everyone wanted to try different dishes. We, however, just ordered off the lunch menu. My one friend and I had the crispy beef ($10) and my other friend had the chili shrimp ($11). All entrées came with steamed rice and a spring roll. I really enjoyed the crispy beef as it was, in fact, crispy but not chewy and the sauce had the right balance of sweet and savory. Sometimes I find crispy beef can be too much like candied beef, if that makes sense. My friend that had the shrimp enjoyed it as well; she said the shrimp were very fresh. The only downside is that the beef dishes could have been hotter in temperature but that won't stop me from returning."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials with awesome quality and made within 10 minutes! I tend to go for the S&S chicken- so tasty! The restaurant itself is small with 4 people booths and tables, so takeout would be my preference."}
{"text":"Their lunchtime specials are great. Try out the Spicy Schezuan Shrimp with rice. THe food is really quite good, and the portions are large. The focus here is on authenticity and quality ingredients. The ambiance is also quite relaxing. Definitely one of the better Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Nice little joint. Went for a weekday dinner alone as I was on a business trip.  Ambiance is very simple but elegant.  Food was good. Had their Wanton soup, Spicy and Salty Shrimp and a Schezwan Noodle dish.  I like thin egg noodles and they happily substituted the regular noodles for what I like.  Best part of the restaurant was that they offer 'small' and 'large' portions.  For those dining alone, NOTHING like it.  You get to try a few different things and yet not pay close to double.  Also serve their house wine by the glass (6 oz) or even by the 1/2 litre (close to 18 OZ).  What a great deal.  Mix and match as you please and pay a reasonable price.  Only reason for a 4 was I felt the service was a bit 'rushed'.  Would prefer to have had plates, dishes, glasses taken away at leisure, but maybe it was late and so they wanted to get the dishes done sooner than later.  All in all, a good dinner."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant a 3.5-star rating.  I visited this restaurant a while back for lunch with my colleagues from work. I have only been here once. This restaurant is a five-minute drive from my workplace.  It was a Friday. It's wasn't all that busy when we came at around noon. However, the phone was pretty busy catering to takeout orders, which fascinated me.  The restaurant has a bunch of lunch specials. I went with the crispy beef special. It came with rice and a spring roll. The beef had sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I enjoyed my food. It was tasty and filling.  My manager thought that the food was okay. I don't recall what he had ordered, though.  I recall how nice the tablecloth was. Service was fast that day.  (52)"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent place to get a $10 chinese food lunch.  Their location is pretty small so get there early if you want a seat.  Their take-out lunch specials are reasonable priced at $7-10 and include you choice of meat, rice, and a spring roll or you can order a-la-carte.  The decor is modern and simple.  The staff are polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Middle of the road fare. The chicken wonton soup had rubbery wontons, flavorless but filling otherwise. Had Shanghai noodles with chicken, which was supposed to be spicy and wasn't. Lots of chicken and shrimp but also light on flavour.  All in all, I would still come back, but more authentic Chinese fast food can be had in the area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. Ordered fish chilly and chicken Manchurian. Both the items were excellent. Good, fresh food with good service. It is a small cozy place. Would recommend it. The pricing was good as well. Very affordable. Good quantities as well."}
