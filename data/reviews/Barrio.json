{"text":"Amazing tacos! A must try if you're in the area. Quaint place with great service! We visited before a Cav's game! Awesome location."}
{"text":"Best tacos for price there are. They brought food trucks to my wedding. Ill always love this place. Good drinks too. Way laid back dining spot in area full of great fine dining."}
{"text":"Our latest visit to The Barrio was to their new location in Lakewood. Dare I say, it is even cooler than the Tremont restaurant, or at least larger and much easier to get seated. The decor is very fun with Day of the Dead murals on all walls, a bicycling skeleton suspended above head, festive lights, and a unique chandelier made out of liquor bottles.  The menu is the same with build-your-own custom tacos, which were delicious, although we agreed they were a little spicier than Tremont's version. Then again, one person at our table ordered the Ghost-Pepper sauce, so... caliente doesn't cover it. First he began turning red and sweating, and finally admitted he was on fire.  Anyway, a great addition to Lakewood, the Barrio delivers a cool and interesting twist on the taco experience."}
{"text":"Upon recommendation of trusted foodie friends, we checked out The Barrio in Tremont. Our friends did not steer us wrong!  The Barrio is located in the old 806 Winebar on Literary Avenue. They redecorated with fun Day of the Dead murals on the walls and a grunge-goth vibe on the menus.  You are provided menus and pencils to check off toppings to build your own tacos, and to choose from starters such as guacamole (4 creative variations), tortilla soup, salad and sides. The ingredients are fresh and eclectic and mix and match makes the taco options seem endless.  They brought us chips and salsa to start. The salsa roja was muy caliente - actually a little too hot for us - so we moved onto guacamole. We ordered the Tuscan guacamole which was finished with a balsamic reduction and pine nuts. It was fresh, generously portioned, and an interesting mix of sweet and spice. I was also tempted to try the mango guacamole, but that will have to wait until next time.  We built our tacos knowing we'd be back to try other varieties, because the options sounded so intriguing (ie: jicama slaw with strawberries, cilantro pesto, chipotle honey...)  Also there were plenty of vegetarian options with tofu and black beans on the protein list. The tacos are actually small, but so is the price of $3. We wished after so carefully choosing the toppings for each taco that there would have been a larger version for a few more dinaro.  They have quite a happy hour - daily from 5-7pm and then reverse happy hour later on - in fact only a few hours in the evening are not \"happy\"! Tequila and whiskey seem to be the house drinks, but we didn't indulge as we stuck to our usual wine.  Overall, we loved the vibe and concept, and look forward to returning! Oh, and of course they inherited the nice patio from 806 with an open air fireplace for those chilled evenings."}
{"text":"Fun and tasty!  Turkey Dinner Taco was very \"yummy\" (per my wife). I enjoyed a chicken taco with the salsa roja and Barrio Secret Sauce."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, the \"secret sauce\" is delicious and if you have the chance to try the Tuscan guac you should defiantly do it! So good! Happy hour is a decent deal and they have a late night one and regular 4-6pm happy hour."}
{"text":"The mojitos are great, and the tacos are amazing and reasonably priced, the guacamole dip is the best and the service in general is spot on"}
{"text":"For a place who's main focus is tacos, I was not impressed.  The highlights:  great patio, salsa's, sauces & toppings  The lowlights:  the protein.  The braised beef was very sweet.  Too sweet.  Pulled Pollo did not appear as pulled chicken.  It appeared as pre cooked chicken in chunks like you would buy at the grocery store that had some seasoning thrown on as an afterthought.  Not much flavor at all.  While the pulled pork was the best of the three, it was cold !  Now that I think about it, all the meats were cold !  I'll give it some time before I go back, I hope they get things sorted out as the concept is great and who doesn't love a good taco ?"}
{"text":"Barrio is amazing! I have never had anything here I did not like. The tacos are amazing and very original. I've never had tacos like this before. They don't claim to be authentic street tacos- they market their brand as something original and it's definitely working for them! The line is insanely busy during peak hours so I recommend going at like 3 pm on a weekend day if you don't want to wait.  I love their patio and in their main seating area they have awesome skeleton art and a charming fireplace which they actually turn on when its cold out. You can make your own tacos or try one of their amazing suggestions. I noticed they recently added peppers next to their sauces so if you can't handle the heat, you know what to stay away from. After writing this review I am now craving their dirty taco! Might have to stop by this weekend..."}
{"text":"Throughout the last year, I've made it back to Barrio a number of times (quite a few, actually). I have to say the food has improved significantly  since the beginning. They are always experimenting with new taco fillings and shells, and have stepped up the tastiness game on their tofu taco. The guac and chips are great too, and the salsa has just the right amount of kick. This summer the patio is finally open, which helps relieve some of the business that can happen inside in the evenings as Barrio is bumping pretty much every night of the week."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Cleveland. When i first started working in Tremont I went there for $2 tacos 23 out of the 30 days the first month.  No matter what you get, you MUST get it on their famous stoner shell."}
{"text":"Pros: -I love the food -location  Cons: -Could lay off the hipster attitude of the hostesses -decor is uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. Which honestly is such a shame since I love the Tremont location. After a concert last night we eventually made our way to barrio. It was our last stop before ending the night. We recognized that we were entering barrio at 1:15 am, 45 mins before closing time. We know the people working don't necessarily like when people come in so late, so I made it a point to ask the hostess if we could still be seated and order food. She said yes, but we have to order food at the bar. I said, no problem and thanked her. I rushed my friends to fill out the taco slips so we wouldn't hold the staff up, and I took mine and my spouses slip to the bar as instructed. When I eventually got a bartenders attention, a short skinny brown haired female, who was focused on cleaning rather than taking any orders she gave me An attitude for even asking her to take our slips. Another girl behind the bar who also was cleaning, also stood with the bartender staring at me like we were interrupting them. At this point it was 1:20 am. The bartender grudgingly took my slips from me and I asked if I could also put a drink order in. She demanded my ID and card, which is normal and I gladly handed it over but she asked for it very, very rudely. I still just handed it over because we wanted our order put in. She then realized, after I have her my Id, credit card and full order that we were sitting at a table and informed me a server will serve the table and to give my order to him. I was annoyed at this point because I put up with her bad attitude and put my full order in with her only to be told to put it in again with the server. I informed the bartender, the hostess is misinforming everyone, because everyone in my party was told to order food at the bar! The server , a male with long dark hair in a ponytail, had less of an attitude but still was very pushy and annoyed that we decided to come in after 1.... his attitude wasn't as bad as the bartenders. I know servers, bartenders, etc want to go home but... you are open until two.. so don't treat customers like it's an inconvenience for YOU that we came in, politely trying to abide by the rules when all we want to do is spend money in your establishment. On top of that, my spouse didn't get the correct tacos that he ordered. His order was completely wrong but again, we didn't complain because the server and bartender made it clear they didn't want our business to begin with. We won't be back, and the Tremont establishment that we have visited many times and had GREAT service with will lose our business too because it's the same company. It's sad. If you work downtown and are walking distance from the Q, expect to be busy.. until closing time!"}
{"text":"Cool Hispanic urban vibe.  Love the Dio de los Muertes wall art.  Great designer tacos and guac."}
{"text":"food is awesome. lack service many problems/ empty glasses/ wrong order/ waited for drinks. asked for the manager through the hostess. The hostess just went to the server. sever came over and never spoke with the manager."}
{"text":"Stopped in Barrio with a friend following a Browns game based on the recommendation of our hotel bartender.  Was fairly busy, but not packed.  Sat at the bar because as that seemed like the best seats to view the tvs.  Both bartenders that took care of us were very good.  We both ordered the build your own tacos.  Tacos were good and reasonably priced at $3 per. They arrived to us quickly and were hot.  They have a great selection of tap beer that ranges from $4-$6.  I didnt count the selections,  but seemed like at leat 25-30 taps plus another 30+ different bottled brews.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Lolita was crammed and the hostess recommended Barrio. I'm very glad she did. Loved the tacos and the margaritas hit the spot."}
{"text":"I love everything about Barrio! The food is delicious and there are so many combinations that you can make something new every time you are in. The drink menu is pretty extensive as well so that is always a plus. It can get a little crowded so be prepared for a wait time if you are going at peak hours."}
{"text":"Beer selection is great. Love the atmosphere as well. We had great device and the food was wonderful. A \"go to\" spot for great food and drinks."}
{"text":"I love this place - I come here every time I visit Cleveland!  The make-your-own tacos are excellent and reasonably priced.  Try the Stoner taco (softshell and hardshell with chorizo in between) and any of the meat options with their cilantro-lime aioli.  Delicious.  I've found the service to be quick and enthusiastic, and helpful if you have questions.  The only issue - and I'm not docking any stars for this - is the drink specials are rather expensive.  Still, it's downtown Cleveland here, so take that into consideration.  If you like tacos, give Barrio a try."}
{"text":"Fav happy hour-hands down! I'm so happy we finally have one on the East Side. The margaritas are the best around and they come up with some really cool, creative queso. The ONLY complaint I have is that they got rid of the crabby cake off the brunch menu. However, I can always find something good here, so it's not too big of a complaint."}
{"text":"The best tacos in all of Cleveland, Ohio. Stoner taco is probably my favorite, the half margaritas aren't bad either. Great place and atmosphere."}
{"text":"great tacos. beer is pricey and served in ruddy mason jars(its not hip, its douchey) so i always get it to go."}
{"text":"The food here is great don't get me wrong however this is the second time in a row I have placed a to go order, went home only to find out I have three less tacos then I ordered... Make sure to check your bag before you leave every time"}
{"text":"Either I went on an \"off\" day, or something happened here.  The service I received the 2nd time around was not good.  Not terrible but not good at all.  Our server was hard to get a hold of & the place was not busy at all, maybe 4 or 5 other tables there and another server was there to help her.  I asked for a water refill & the girl came back with a bottle of water & slammed it on the table, kind of like saying \"don't bother me again.\"    Had the stoner queso which in my mind is the only thing worth eating here.  I made 2 tacos & honestly they weren't that good.  There are so many places in Cleveland with amazing tacos that I'd rather go in the future.  The only plus here is you can build your own the way you like it.    Also, not a good place to bring kids. They have no high chairs or booster seats."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Barrio.  The perfect was delicious.  Do not waste your time with the house margaritas if you want a real drink this is perfect! Tacos were tasty and very cool that you can create your own.  Queso isn't the best but not bad if you need a cheese fix."}
{"text":"Barrio is an awesome, hipster, build-your-own taco bar with a ton of delicious options and an extensive drink list. It's hard to mess up your order because everything goes together perfectly! Paired with a fun Día de Muertos atmosphere, it's a great place for lunch, dinner or drinks."}
{"text":"For casual tacos and a good drink, head to Barrio in Lakewood. The food is fresh but the service model is a step away from Chipotle. I hated the process for \"build your own.\" Very confusing but maybe because it wasn't explained to us. The server was aloof if not \"put out\" by us being in her section. Again, don't go for the typical restaurant experience; go for the novelty."}
{"text":"ALWAYS excellent...Bar staff is very personable and friendly and helpful and fun!  The food is always fresh and good and consistent. I have never been disappointed....and Brunch is great too!!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and drinks. It can get very crowded on certain nights, but there is usually somewhere to sit. It's a great place to grab a drink, hang with friends, or take a date. The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio twice so far. Once with my girlfriend on a late Tuesday night. Everything was excellent, from the food to the friendly staff. There were only a half-dozen other couples and small groups, so it was quiet. I especially liked the build-you-own taco sheets and the long beer list. We were excited to come back, and surprised to find they're open late 7 days a week.  The second time was a Thursday, maybe 7-9pm, and we had a group of 5-6. It was pretty noisy and crowded, not that I can really blame them for drawing business. The tables all seemed to be set up for groups of 4 so we had to cram, and keep menus and unnecessary items on the floor. Fortunately the service was still prompt and friendly and the food was great. We split some salmon guacamole before the tacos and it was tasty and looked good too.  I made sure to try a variety of taco ingredients and liked them all! There are maybe 7 meat choices including pulled pork, chorizo, and fish. Careful with the salsas and sauces if you're sensitive to capsaicin ;) The chipotle crema and chipotle honey are tasty but not short on heat. Others are even hotter.  My biggest disappointment would probably be that beers are all served in mason jars and all kind of tasted the same. I guess it's fine if you love IPA exclusively but for a long list I expected more variety and proper glassware. Or lower prices... beers were all $1-2 more than I'm used to paying.  I think on both visits my tab came to ~$30. That's with 3 tacos and 2-3 beers.  Overall I was quite happy (esp. with the food and service) and will definitely go back... probably with a smaller group, late or on a Sunday night when most other places are closed."}
{"text":"Got a basic strawberry margarita on the rocks. No tequila opinions and I left for the bathroom, I got well. All I'm tasting is nasty tequila. No bueno. We got some traditional guacamole and of course their salsa. It's ok. Just ok, and that's it. Too bad. We'll stick to other Mexican joints in Westpark and Ohio City."}
{"text":"I love this place. This is my go to for Tacos. Every time I go here there is great service and a good beer selection.  You cant go wrong with the suggested tacos or just making your own."}
{"text":"Maybe some people like soggy tacos that taste crappy. I would rather eat at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Being open until 2am is a plus for those with late night munchies. The El Filadelfia & Carne Trozo tacos were good."}
{"text":"My favorite tacos! Lots of choices at a pretty decent price. Wait staff are always friendly and open to answering questions about specials and menu items. My only complaint is that the music tends to be on the overly loud side."}
{"text":"I was excited to go and try Barrio given that I've heard good things about the other locations.   While the appetizer was amazing, I was disappointed with their mediocre service and the cold tacos.   We ordered off of the restaurant week menu and got our appetizer within a reasonable amount of time. We then waited twenty minutes before we saw the server again and asked her to check on our meal. She came back and told us it would be another twenty minutes. She never apologized, all she said was that they were busy which is why it was taking so long. A forty minute turnaround time seems unreasonable, even when busy. Five minutes after she left our tacos arrived, although cold, so we can only assume they were sitting out for a while.   The main reason I was so disappointed is at the lack of courtesy. My parents were in town and I wanted them to try something new. A food runner brought out our meals and then told us he had two orders for the old couple and then looked directly at my parents to serve them their food.   If I hear their service improves, I would give them another shot. For now, it won't be a place where I take people to."}
{"text":"I give them credit for great vibe at the Lakewood restaurant. I was excited about trying out this place. However, I was really disappointed by the super soggy, greasy tacos. Obviously they do not drain their meat. If you like greasy spoon restaurants then this is the place for you. Not impressed with the quality of the tacos. Dripping wet and cold - I'm kind to give them 2 stars. I'm sure the alcohol masts the quality for the drinking customers."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience and have been here at least 5 times. With all the options to create your own tacos you would think they would mess one up. Out of all the times the orders are exact and always good. Good margaritas too!!"}
{"text":"Margaritas are fab, especially at a happy hour price. Dissappointed there are no soft corn tortillas. But they make up for it in flavor. Fish tacos were excellent. So was the jicama slaw. Besides being a bit lukewarm, was really satisfied with the dinner."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 tacos for $15. Tacos took an hour to come out of the kitchen, and they were on the cold side of warm. With 11 people at our table 3 people refused to go past their second taco...7 people said they will never come back including myself"}
{"text":"Have made several visits and has been consistently good every time.  Lots of variations of tacos to make and large beer selection.  Can get noisy and crowded on the weekend but the food has always been on point regardless of the crowd."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I don't ever do this. In fact, I initially created a Yelp account to combat the frivolous and irresponsible panning of establishments online. But after my last experience at Barrio (and when I say last, I also mean the LAST time I will ever go there), I felt I should say a few words.  I have been to Barrio probably five or six times since I moved to Cleveland. Each time we have managed to enjoy ourselves despite the increasingly deteriorating quality of food and service. When I mention this to people I encounter in the world when the subject of Barrio comes up in conversation, we all commiserate and laugh. The general feeling is that the atmosphere is fun, the food is decent, and the service is terrible. Notoriously so. But no one seems to care. And I really didn't either. I have worked in restaurants of all kinds from top to bottom for over a decade. I've seen the good, the bad, and everything in between. And I am generally content in any environment unless there is something or someone that it totally exceptional that wholly interferes with my ability to enjoy myself.  A friend and I wanted food late night in Tremont around 11 and at that time, the options are fairly limited. Someone suggested Barrio and unable to think of another spot, we decided to grab some tacos and a few beers. When we walked in the door, the host was doubled over laughing, gesturing wildly, and holding onto the host stand for support. We asked for a table and she led us to a two-top in the back of the bar. Looking around, we asked if the patio was open and if we might sit out there instead. She was visibly annoyed and said \"fuck it, lets go outside then\" to my friend. Again, neither of us cared. We just wanted tacos and beer. As we followed her, I noticed she wasn't exactly walking straight, and I rapidly realized that she was totally shit-faced wasted. When we got out onto the patio where it was much more quiet, this was confirmed by the fact that I could barely understand what she was saying. As she sloppily gestured to our table, she asked my friend through a heavy slur and in an angry tone if he wanted to \"try out the table first so [she didn't] have to move [him] again\". I think she was trying to be funny but was at that point in the night with her liquor that it was beginning to turn on and she was getting nasty. My friend and I exchanged a look between us as if to say \"is this girl serious?\" right now and we sat down. He told her she couldn't hold her liquor very well and she became upset and left the patio. Whatever. WE JUST WANTED TACOS AND BEER.  It was probably 15 minutes before anyone came over to our table. When someone did, it was a busser that we flagged down and asked for chips and salsa. 10 minutes. still nothing. We asked another busser for chips and salsa. Another couple of minutes. At this point, we weren't annoyed. We both work in the industry and have for a very long time. It was funny to us in that absurd kind of way. When our server finally did come over (probably not her fault as I'm sure the wasted host didn't tell her to take our table), she was also visibly drunk and slurring her words to the point that it was interfering with my comprehension of her speech. I mean, cmon dude. I've certainly done by fair share of drinking on the clock, but never at the gross expense of good service. So she takes our paper ticket that we have filled out and disappears.  Let me say while I'm at it that the \"build your own taco\" thing that everyone is so crazy about at Barrio is fucking ridiculous. When the novelty of it inevitably wears off, you realized that your \"server\" (who doesn't 1. verbally take your order, 2. deliver food, 3. refill/replenish food/drink, or 4. buss your table) doesn't actually DO any serving AT ALL. They are in actuality a paper-delivery person.  Next time we saw her, she was more drunk than before. We moved to the bar when it got cold. The bartender who took our order was super rude. This tall white guy with stubble and a right arm sleeve was visibly offended by my friend asking about the Avion tap handle and stormed off. Another guest joined us shortly there after (mind you, we are 3 of 10 people in the bar) and he never came over. Never came back to our table. What a prick. Another bartender (white, female, short blonde hair, tattoos) came over when she noticed we were being intentionally ignored. She was not drunk (surprised) and actually really nice.  If I could give Barrio less than one star, I would. The food is ABSURDLY MEDIOCRE and the staff are a bunch of drunken dopehead hipsters who think their shit doesn't stink. Its a shame that the beautiful building housing this glorified taco truck is wasted on this business. The best thing I took from the night was the Ticonderoga pencil I walked out with behind my ear. Never going back."}
{"text":"It's probably just me, but I remember when $3 bucks was steep for a small cold taco. Having traversed various bars for many years, this is the first place happy hour existed only at the bar, not for dinner guests. I guess 'hipstermex' has it's price, but when I'm spending that much for tacos the least I could get is the same price the bar squatters get on drinks."}
{"text":"Three stars for beer selection, good chips, and fun atmosphere. Been here three times, always ordering something new. WHY are the tacos always cold?? And soggy? And the meat devoid of flavor? Gave it three honest tries, but was not thrilled. Good place for chips and craft beers though."}
{"text":"We keep saying that we need to go to Barrio but only think about it on Friday nights when no one should be thinking about eating at a trendy location.  I was super excited when a friend opted to have a going-away gathering here on a Wednesday evening.   First--this place is TRENDY.  Time it right and I'm sure that you can get a table right away but if you're going on normal nights at normal meal times--you're going to have to wait a bit.  It's ok, I'm glad they're getting good business.   Once we were seated, our server was prompt and attentive if not overly concerned.  She was busy.  Everything was busy.  We filled out our menu cards.  I am not a pro at building my own anything as I tend to be overwhelmed with things I want to try and end up with a mess of things that just don't go. Fortunately, Barrio cares for people like me with a short list of items the chef has put together.  I opted for his vegan creation and enjoyed it immensely.  Between the chips, salsa, and guacamole--one taco was plenty.  We ordered a trio of guacs but the classic one was our favorite.  The fancy one had too much fruit and the pineapple salsa was basically just pineapple.   Their salsa was great.  Even our Cilantro-Tastes-Like-Soap-Person enjoyed it in tiny doses.   My taco was full of mushrooms, sauces, and pickley things.  I would not have ordered any of those things on my own and was very thankful that the chef thought to put them together.  It was delicious and just spicy enough.  Loved it. Nice beer list, would love to try one of their cocktails or something.  Will definitely be back in the not so distant future."}
{"text":"Since the first time I went, Barrio has always been one of my favorites... I didn't always have time to make it to the downtown locations and then they opened this gem! Been several times and every single time has been a positive experience. From the wait staff to the bartenders to the hosts and hostesses it's always friendly and seamless.  The beer selection is tremendous and the build your own taco is my favorite as I like to try several combinations of flavors to appease my tastebuds. This remains one of my favorite restaurants around and you can't beat the delicious food and drink and friendly atmosphere, especially for the price. Keep up the good work. I'll be back soon lol!"}
{"text":"The Tuscan gauc with goat cheese and balsamic is nothing you have ever tasted before! I love the coca cola steak although I have gotten pieces that are fatty and chewy which is never enjoyable when eating finger foods. Their taco shells with queso and gauc in them tastes great. Ive eaten here many times and overall one of my favorite places to go to."}
{"text":"I live in Tremont right down the street from Barrio and was very excited about its opening.   Needless to say, our visit was terrible. The server was less than enthusiastic, the food was bland and the margaritas tasted like a mix instead of freshly made. While the tacos are reasonably priced at $3 each, the portion of meat and fixin's is minimal and the tacos arrived cold; also, the salsa was watery and didn't have any flavor.  I won't return until the fall and will hope for a better experience. Tremont is a great neighborhood for dining so I advise checking out another restaurant and give Barrio some time to mature."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is below satisfactory...... I was never told about there happy hour or the specials. The tables are small so when they brought my food/chips and salsa they failed to grab the things we were finished with before leaving. So we were sitting trying to eat with a pile of trash on our table....."}
{"text":"I was kinda of skeptical of this place but after giving it a shot it was worth it. If you like tacos and chips and salsa and what not YOU HAVE TO STOP HERE!!  Load atmosphere but kinda of goes with the feel of the bar.. most stop in Cleveland"}
{"text":"I have to say the food is a three but the service pushed it to solid four, Jess was our server very attentive and quickly greeted us and had a really good flow with timing of drinks and food clearing table.  I also liked that the  guy who brought us water was friendly and the manager as well.   The tacos are good I had a pork and beef, the beef was somewhat dry if you didn't get all the other toppings in a bite.  Sauces are tasty other toppings good as well.   I would go back to try the different combinations and the cheese sauce, I was not crazy about the guac but I am really picky about quac."}
{"text":"Barrio is amazing. The tacos are always worth it and the staff is welcoming as well. I like the happy hour specials and the quaintness of the restraint on Literary. I give Barrio's food and staff five-stars but three-stars for the Mexican theme of the eatery but the lack of people who belong to the culture involved in the local businesses."}
{"text":"This review is for the food truck.  I was really anxious to try some of these tacos, haven't yet gotten to the physical restaurant, but when I saw the truck would be at an event I decided to try the offerings, knowing that there would be a limited menu rather than the \"make your own\" concept.  I was expecting something along the lines of Touch Supper Truck where they have some unusual and tasty taco combinations on the truck.  Or maybe MOGO Korean Fusion Tacos in Asbury Park.  In short, a small menu with some really zingy tastes.   After waiting in the super long Barrio truck line, I ordered one of each taco (chorizo, black bean and chicken).  I was very disappointed to find that they (a) all tasted pretty much the same - no real attempt to adapt the ingredients for a different fun taste for each variety taco -  and (b) were LOADED with \"Barrio slaw\".  There was so much slaw on these that in the case of the black bean and chicken, I actually had difficulty finding the beans and the chicken in the taco.  It was basically like a cole slaw sandwich for 3 dollars and change.  It tasted like nothing.  I actually wondered whether the truck was running short on fillings due to a larger than anticipated crowd and just slawed the heck out of everything so they could get away with putting in a teaspoon of beans.   Disappointing to stand in such a long line expecting something great and get something that's way worse than even Chipotle.  I'll still try the physical restaurant but I will be sure to do the \"make your own\" option and avoid that slaw like the plague."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Tremont location but tonight was my first time visiting the downtown Barrio. My overall experience was decent I much prefer the environment of the Tremont Barrio but I must commend the establishment on their ability to choose great bartenders...My evening was made so much better by the superb customer service I received from Gia (I believe that's her name) I work in an environment where I am aware of the difficulty involved in maintaining high customer volume while being friendly and sociable with each person and she handled herself very well! I will definitely be back just because of the level of service she supplied. Kudos to the hiring staff! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!  Lots of options love that you can chose everything that goes in the taco. That hard shell with the hair in between the soft shell is amazing.  Tofu is also really good for the vegetarians my tacos turned out great. The trio with the guac and cheese I can just live off of!! Love it will be back again soon"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here this weekend. Everyone who worked here from the host to the bartenders to the waiters were extremely rude and unprofessional. We have been long time customers but after this weekend, we will never be back and give them anymore of our business. The drinks tasted terrible and we found foreign objects in our drinks. If this place wants to keep up its business they need to pay attention to the customers who are actually providing them with this business. Absolutely horrific experience here. Save your money and go ANYWHERE else. The manager Heather also did a terrible job trying to deal with our complaints."}
{"text":"Told my party we had 40 minutes until a table opened for us and put is on the waiting list. They notified us after 10 minutes that a table had opened, however by this time we had walked a decent bit away. Our table was given away the minute we walked in.  The food is okay though."}
{"text":"After a lot of hype from co-worker who LOVES Barrio, we decided to give it a try for dinner tonight. I have lived in several Mexican neighborhoods in Chicago and I often crave authentic, Mexican food, but have not really found anything to satisfy that craving in the Cleveland area yet. I was really excited to build my own tacos with a decent variety of ingredients. We walked in at dinner time (7pm) on a Saturday. It was busy but we could see that there were a few seats open and there were no other customers waiting for a table. From the minute we walked in, we felt COMPLETELY unwelcome. The hostess just stared at us when we approached her, never greeting us or asking how many were in our party. I had to tell her we had 2 in our party after a long, awkward pause. She looked at the bar and said there might be seats in there and walked away. When she returned to us she told us, 'Yeah, there's a table in the bar' and asked if we wanted it. We said ok and she took awhile to focus on us again but eventually responded with, 'I'll be with you in a minute' walked away briefly and then had another hostess seat us. We sat and never had anyone ask if we'd ever been there or how to order our food. We figured it out on our own but a little intro to the food at Barrio would not have taken much effort at all. We were able to figure out the order forms and checked our selections, only knowing that there were specials by finding the small sign tucked behind another sign on the table. Our server took our order for tacos and queso blanco. Chips and salsa were delivered soon after and a few minutes later our queso was practically dropped on our table as if the guy delivering it couldn't be bothered to kindly serve it to us. The guy who delivered our food was the first person to give us reasonable service telling us to 'enjoy our meal.' The guy who took our empty trays was also friendly, asking how our food was. Neither of these guys were our server. She was clearly uninterested in us. After our food trays were cleared away she walked by us about 5 times, making eye contact, but never asking if we needed or wanted anything else to drink, any dessert or even our check despite the fact that we had only chips and salsa left. We had to ask for our check after waiting way too long for her to get the hint. I have worked as a hostess, bartender and a server in busy downtown Chicago restaurants and my fiance has worked in a few busy restaurants, as well.  We both know what a busy weekend dinner service entails but we never once felt like we were really worth anyone's time or effort. It was like the staff was way too cool to be bothered to provide good service. We also usually tip really well-often at least 25%, but neither of us could justify paying more than 15% tip to our server and that NEVER happens. We both thought the food was ok, not the best tacos ever, but good enough. It seemed like the staff was more concerned with themselves than providing any customer service to us. We are really patient, understanding diners usually and our experience tonight really left something to be desired.  We live in Lakewood but might be trying the Tremont location next time to see if the service is better. Hoping they can impress us enough to make us return. So far not a fan and still looking for somewhere to eat good Mexican food, while actually getting good customer service."}
{"text":"Manager needs training in customer service . We are frequent customers that will continue to visit Barrio, just not in Lakewood as long as Bart is employed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Happy Hour is amazing- Just moved to Cleveland and brought my friends here recently from out of town. Wish the patio was open,,, Cant wait to sit on it in the spring. I love that you can build your own tacos. Our waiter was super helpful with picking choices. Great service and amazing food and drinks!!"}
{"text":"Always a winner!   We hopped in for a quick bite at 4:10 yesterday. By 4:25 the place was packed with a line out the door. You can not have a bad experience at Barrio. Drinks are delicious, food is beyond delicious, service is consistently good. I was glad our dinner reservation was late so we could hop in to Barrio at 4:00 and enjoy a little something. I wish we had one close to home - I'd be there multiple times a week!"}
{"text":"Neat place. I was confused as to how exactly to order during my first visit and didn't want to take too many chances with adding the wrong items on my tacos, it gets better as I continue to go back. Service is ok. Nothing horrible but nothing special"}
{"text":"Er ma gerhd! Beware the tequila ninja's!  Broke my own rule by going to a new restaurant in the first few months-but it was worth it. Not a fan of tequila in general but got into the spirit of Barrio and had a couple fru-fru margarita's (El Diablo?) Amazing!  We split a chorizo queso dip; ordered a second margarita; then did the Happy Dog and built two tacos.  Went for the flour tortilla ( I'm ashamed of myself as well) and mixed up the protein...chorizo and beef brisket.  I can't remember what else I put on there because by that time I had a good start on my second drink...hence the tequila ninja's.  Whatever it was, I made some very wise choices.  Sides of black beans and pickled veg topped off the meal, and at the urging of our server, an order of sopapilla chips. Holy crap! Fried and topped with honey, cinnamon, and sugar...er ma gerhd...we devoured the bag. Signs all over the place say \"Brunch Coming Soon\" and soon cannot come fast enough for me."}
{"text":"I went to Barrio's with may wife and a group of friends after considering going to a Tex-Mex style restaurant. I am sure glad we chose Barrio's instead. We all built tacos and had them on their corn tortilla's that was very good, and the taco's were just right. The pork and chicken I had was moist and flavorful, I could have stood a little more heat, from the sauce that said muy caliente. Everyone in my group really liked their tacos. I first ordered a Margarita which I don't remember the name and I could not drink it. I just did not like it, but my wife did. So Mo the bartender said to pick a new one and the other one she would take off the bill. I then gave mine to my wife and she made me a new Margarita that I really liked and if fact I had a second one. Mo really took care of us. We all had a good time and left satisfied, and would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Barrio is a pretty good place to go for happy hour. Their margaritas are half price, but not that great or that strong. Their tacos are really good and inexpensive. Their chips and salsa/guacamole are also pretty good, but not the best I've had. This is somewhere that I would probably go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way. Overall, I would rate Barrio as \"above average\"."}
{"text":"Barrio is sooooooo OVERRATED. I really don't understand the love for this place.  Yes, it's cheap. But service is usually pretty mediocre and the food is, in my opinion, hit or miss. Last time I came the tacos I received were cold. Tonight, I ordered the fish of the day and received one tiny piece of fish in my taco. What gives? Not cool.   However, their chips and salsa are addicting and I always find the margaritas to be top notch."}
{"text":"I would love to eat here again. The style and feel of the restaurant. The build-your-own taco menu makes you want to try things you other wise wouldn't of. The service was fast and friendly. There was a patio next to the building that offered a tasteful view as we ate our tacos next to a fire place. Come here for tacos!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost monthly and have always had great food.  Most recently I visited on a Saturday around 5:00 pm and they were VERY busy.  We were told there was only one group ahead of us and the wait shouldn't be very long.  We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table which doesn't seem so bad, but when we were lead to our table we passed 3 or 4 empty and cleaned tables that had just been sitting there.  Anyway, by the time we were seated we were VERY hungry so we ordered the Potato and Leak guacamole.  One of the kitchen staff brought it out a few minutes later and we were several chips into it  when our server returned and told us we had the wrong guac.  We had ordered the Potato and Leak but we were given the Tuscan guac.  She apologized and asked if we'd like to have the P/L instead, but the Tuscan was so delicious we asked if we could keep it and she said yes.  A few minutes later she brought us a smaller complimentary bowl of the Potato and Leak just so we could see the difference (the P/L was good, but the Tuscan was BETTER).  We put in our order for a total of 8 tacos and then we waited.  After about 45 minutes our food arrived.  It was all delicious and everything was exactly as ordered but I've never had to wait that long at Barrio before.  Reading some of the comments about cold tacos, I will say that the salsa was ice cold (as it should be) but all the proteins were all at least warm, if not hot.  So I doubt our food had just been sitting there, but a 45 minute turn-around time for an order is just WAY too long.  Our server and the food were both excellent (it was a very classy move to bring us an extra bowl of guac after the mix up) and it's INCREDIBLY reasonably priced.  It's just the wait time for a table and an even longer wait time for our food that keeps Barrio Lakewood from a perfect score."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town for a wedding recently.  Another friend attending the wedding went to Barrio a couple nights before and recommended it.  So, we decided to check it out and loved it as well.  We tried 5 different tacos between us as well as the chips and guacamole.  All were outstanding.  The place is very affordable too.  If this was near our home, we would dine here extremely regularly.  Only downside was the service was pretty snotty.  And it wasn't just our server, but the person that gave us our food as well.  And we waited a very long time to be waited on after being seated.  However, the food was so great it was still a fantastic experience overall.  To be honest, my biggest issue with Barrio is that it is all the way in Cleveland and so far away from our home..."}
{"text":"Make the trip over to get Happy Hour that I see advertised on their website.  It's a nice day so my friend and I wanted to eat out side, however you can ONLY order happy hour when you sit at the bar.  Wait staff and bartender were rude, so I decided to walk across the street where there was a real happy hour.  Had a much better experience there.  Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Best margaritas in town, awesome authentic mexican, cool vibes, friendly bartenders & staff. Cheap prices too, never have more than a $40 bill for 2 ($3 a taco). I come here probably once a month"}
{"text":"I've had several different experiences here. And I have to be honest, the 1st few, we're TERRIBLE. Bad service and horribly snobby hipster servers that made it seem like you were bothering them when you asked for anything, and my food was kind of cold when it was brought out. Another time, I had called ahead and placed an order then came to pick-up my food, and then sat there for 45 minutes waiting, while it turned out my food was behind the bar the whole time and no one bothered to tell me it was even there. I was also pick-pocketed at the bar one night while picking up a to go order.  Since then, I had never gone back, until about 1 year later. And I must say the quality of service GREATLY improved. The food had always been great (a little over priced for what it is) but it's always been good. Definetly recomend the chorizo queso."}
{"text":"Well priced delicious tacos with fun and inventive ingredients. Admittedly, as some other reviews have stated, the tacos seem to be thrown together a bit haphazardly sometimes as if the kitchen can't keep up with the high pace in the front of the house. Speaking of which, I avoid this place at all costs on Friday or Saturday nights as you have to wait in line outside just to get in through the door to the hostess stand. If you do make it in, be prepared to be visually assaulted by plaid shirts and mountain man beards as this place is hipster heaven and your tacos will be as described above. Love the place, but only on weeknights or better yet, weekdays."}
{"text":"Custom tacos, extremely good, only around $4 each!! Are you kidding me it's amazing!! 3 tacos filled me up easly"}
{"text":"The first time i ate at Bario, I was very disappointed. I was at the Lakewood location and had the wild boar dinner plate...... Horrible. I ate wild boar plenty of times prepared in different styles, but this was something gone horribly wrong.   I moved to tremont and started going to the local Bario there. Over the years the tacos and service have much improved. The biggest complaint was the hispster service ( rude, and monotone), which improved significantly over the years. There are people there that actually are nice and care about their job. I recently tried the breakfast brunch tacos- Amazing! The breakfast tacos were a pleasant surprise! ( If you never had Barios bacon, you need to try it !!!!!)     The restaurant is fun, I like the art on the walls, and the new patio is great for the summer and fall!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm going to miss Whiskey Wednesdays when I move to Boston. The Tuscan Guacamole is my favorite and never enough!!! The build-your-own tacos are great. Try a Stoner Shell! The staff is very friendly and the artsy feel to the place is fantastic. I would highly recommend this place for their several happy hour specials and food. The drinks can get expensive, but they are original combinations to at least try. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Best location out of all! Great service! I order to go a lot and even having to sit at the bar and order is comfortable. Always offered a water and they're so sweet about our three different gift card payment the one time! Love it, must go! Great for any occasion."}
{"text":"Great food. Very reasonable. The worst bartender before the Indians game and the bar was not even crowded...rude, condescending, and the reason for the 1 star"}
{"text":"This place has pretty good Tex-Mex with a twist in a casual setting. The free chips and salsa are fresh and the salsa actually has some spice, so bonus points for that.  Actually, all the sauces and condiments I tried were flavorful.  You can construct your own taco from a selection of tortillas, sauces, meats, etc.  Or they have some suggested options available.  It's $3-5 for one taco, but they are pretty filling.    This location is open till 1 am, we came late on a Friday night and staff were kind and friendly, even when they needed to let us know it was closing time."}
{"text":"Tonight was Friday's Eve, ie, Thursday night., and my first time at Barrios. I'd give it five stars if it weren't for the slightly awkward order-at-the-bar experience that was a slight put off. But the food was really that good at a great price and enough of a stop gap from subtracting more stars.  When I first came in, I just didn't like how the bartender kept carrying on with other patrons at the bar for what seemed like forever. Funny how I wouldn't have minded if I was just ordering a drink and hunkered down at the bar with the rest of them. But I'm here for the food and my expectations are all, \"I wanna order food!!! TALK TO ME NOW!\"   I seated myself as requested by the sign at the door and my bartender brought my food out but she never came by to ask if I needed my check. I just sat there and waited and waited. My dishes and eating utensils got were bussed away and I'm thinking, \"Ok, she's gonna bring my check.\" No such luck. I still waited. I finally just went up to the bar and asked for my check. She smiled sweetly and gave it to me. Going to the bar and asking for the check is not a problem but Barrio has to train their bartenders on customer awareness and education so customers (especially new ones) are not left hanging.  It is possible for bartenders to smoothly pull double duty as attentive food server while slinging drinks as I have been the recipient of such good service in the past, Just not that night my first time at Barrios.   The food? I ordered a couple tacos and their drink special for that night, a $4 Margarita. The tacos were very good which basically were a chicken taco with the hard corn shell and the pork wtih the soft corn shell. The chipotle adobo cream sauce that the pork taco came with had a little more heat than I expected but I sucked down some ice cubes to ease the heat. Overall, both tacos were pretty freshly made and filling.   When I return (as I must as the patio closed for the winter is probably pretty sickening in the warm summer months) I'll try their tacos with the flour tortilla. Based off of tonight alone, however, the hard corn taco shell is a real star. It's warmth and light crispiness just made for a really pleasing tactile sensation in the mouth.  Other than the awkward misses with service, I am looking forward to coming back to trying more of the inexpensive taco options that are as delicious as they are diverse."}
{"text":"Waitress was really quick and friendly. Tacos were ok. my friend said there's meat in here somewhere. Small but tasty. I ordered a Mango Margarita and it was green! I said I have never had a mango any thing that was green! NO Mango flavor at all! They have a premixed margarita slushy machine! Nothing authentic about this place! Would NOT go back.Nice atmosphere Only soft tacos! You write your order on paper and hand it to waitress! IF YOU' RE JUST DOING TACOS MAKE SOFT AND HARD AND MAKE REAL DRINKS!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in Cleveland other than La Plaza. Modern tacos that are by no means traditional Latin American flavor profiles but definitely worth a visit if you're willing to wait in a line. Each location I've tried has matched the others for wait staff, taste, and overall experience. Tons of vegan and GFree options which is another huge bonus! As a heat seeker, their ghost pepper sauce is UH-MOZ. NOT for those who shy away from burn your eyebrows off heat but extremely complex flavors that provide more than just a shock to the tongue."}
{"text":"The ambience is really what sells Barrio. The decor, the staff, and the overall atmosphere really make this place. The big thing here is the build-your-own tacos which offers you everything you could possibly want for $3 per taco. There's options for everyone: vegan, vegetarian, spicy lovers, and even picky eaters. Service was extremely fast and attentive. This is definitely a great hang out spot with great food to munch on but I wouldn't go in expecting gourmet tacos. Compared to other similar taco joints, Barrio was kind of bland, and my tacos were ice cold. If you're looking for a fun taco night with friends, Barrio is definitely a great spot to hit up! But if you're looking for a more authentic Mexican or taco experience, I'd look elsewhere. Regardless, it's worth a try! You're bound to find something you'll like!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I try to make it here a least once a month if not more.  They have great veggie options and awesome drinks. I usually sit at the bar or bar area and always have outstanding service. Was in this past Sunday and had a wonderful experience as usual.  Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I love barrio. I have been here multiple times with friends and the waiters are amazing and kind and relatable. Wait times around dinner are a little hectic but its so worth it."}
{"text":"Tacos and salsa were awesome - good options, sauces tasted fresh and meat was cooked perfectly.  Margaritas could have been stronger and rice was overly sticky - probably from being in a pot for a while.  Great vibe and Mexican for Cleveland though.  This is definitely on the list of places to return.  Note: I now live in LA, so I am extra qualified to review tacos."}
{"text":"By far my favorite barrio location. My server Angela was absolutely amazing and attentive. I got the curd ferguson and it was delicious. The margs were the right amount of sweet and tequila. I even caught a little buzz! Can't wait to return back and sit on the patio this time!"}
{"text":"My husband and I loveeee barrio so we decided to check out the new location. It looks much like the one tremont- skeletons and skeletons on bikes. It was packed and loud!!! Could barely hear myself think it was so loud. Our margaritas were just as awesome as the other location but our tacos just werent as good as the tremont location. I don't know if it's jut along time to perfect everything but it was sort of disappointing and barrio has NEVER disappointed us before. Well give it another shot sometime or stick with the tremont location."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I LOVE Barrio! We travel from 45 minutes away to eat here pretty regularly. Barrio is great because they are accommodating to many dietary restrictions. We like to bring our friends here so that we don't have to struggle to find a restaurant with good vegan and vegetarian options.   We usually have to wait a bit for a table, but there is lots to do in the area. The hosts usually take your number and call when your table is ready.   For those who haven't been to Barrio before, the menu is based on create your own tacos. You are given a menu, and you choose what you want on the taco. And the best part is, it's insanely cheap and good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are frequent visitors at this Barrio, so I felt like it was time to finally write a great review for them! This place is a really great place to grab tacos and be in and out! So if you're somewhat in a \"hurry\" the wait for food isn't terrible! But of course if you go on a Friday or Saturday, be prepared to wait an hour or so for a table! It does get busy on those nights which isn't a shocker!  The chips and salsa are amazing, so be careful, you will totally fill up on them!!!  The tacos are incredible and come out very quickly (you won't be waiting long!) They also serve margaritas which are amazing, and come in a variety of favors my favorite is the pomegranate flavor! The staff is always very friendly, and for the most part check on you throughout your visit there, tho on busy nights I'm sure it gets a little hectic for them!  Overall this is a great place to grab tacos at! So if you're looking to try something new, I absolutely recommend giving this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Came for happy hour on a Friday, everyone was really friendly and explained how everything worked. I got the stoner and the green goddess , I wish I would have gotten two stoners. The gauc was just ok for $6. The have good happy hour prices on drinks in the bar area. I can't wait to go back for another stoner!"}
{"text":"There are too many good restaurants and servers in Tremont for us to be wasting our time and money here. Sadly, bad service and getting the wrong order have become the norm at Barrio.   We live in the neighborhood and have frequented Barrio since it 1st opened. We've never come here for the service, but the good food at a good price has kept us coming back (and bringing all our friends) for years.   However, in the past 5+ months, things have really started to slip (although we at first thought it might be our imaginations). The food has gone downhill (sloppy tacos and bowls that have become more condiments than ingredients) and we regularly suffer from \"Barrio belly\" the morning after eating here. (Think: \"Delhi Belly\")  Also, the service has become unbearable. Although we've become accustomed to waiting forever before being greeted and poorly timed drinks and food at Barrio, they're now getting our orders completely wrong and always forgetting things. The past two times we've gone, they've swapped my vegetarian order with a taco full-o-meat and we have yet to crack the code that will get us a damn glass of water.   We're not sure whether the problems lie in the efficiency (or lack-there-of) of the bar itself, the kitchen, waitstaff or management (if they even have management) but Barrio has used up all its chances with us."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I think to myself \"Why don't I eat here every day?\"  Honestly my only quip with this place is that if you come after like 6:30pm it just gets really cramped, and we ended up having to stand outside on the street for roughly 20 minutes on a chilly night - it was a Tuesday and we came during Happy Hour, so the bar area was packed. But really, the fact that it's too popular is probably the only thing wrong with this place, and is that really a bad thing?  Tacos look small at first glance but are extremely filling, service is very fast and efficient, the chips and salsa keep flowing; I've never had a bad food/service experience here.  And get the Choco Taco. It's like what you would get from an ice cream truck, only x500 times better."}
{"text":"Had nachos at the Indians game.  Some of the best nachos ever. This is a great addition to the ballpark.  Never get regular nachos at Tribe game again."}
{"text":"The tacos are tasty, with some interesting combinations.  The margaritas are also good.  But my best memory of the meal was fresh nachos with the special guacamole. ... They were amazing and crisp but I must warn you, it can be a hit and miss, the first batch of nachos we got were slightly soggy... But the one that came after was worth the entire visit. That and the special pork belly tacos :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant ruined my birthday. I was from out of town and after some woman with green hair promised on the phone that she had a table available she gave my table away two minutes later and I had to drive around a city I didn't know to find a another restaurant. #unprofessional"}
{"text":"The main reasons I gave this restaurant a 4 star rating is two fold: 1) the staff was incredibly attentive and friendly (my glass of water never hit the bottom and I was always well stocked on chips). 2) The affordability. I cannot speak much on the alcohol prices because I do not drink but $3 for a well stocked taco worked incredibly well for me. Along with the chips and salsa the 2 tacos I ordered filled me up leaving me with a bill a little over $6 and a fairly satisfied stomach. I took off one star because they have a lot of sweet taco toppings that I do not feel work the best and some salsas are very wet and end up covering your hands. Overall great place for some cost effective eating."}
{"text":"Great decor / atmosphere / location / drinks.  Tacos...covered in sauce and aluminum foil. Stick w/ chips and drinks! Amazing service! They comped my tacos as they agreed they looked like something out of a crockpot."}
{"text":"This is easily the best taco place I have ever been to. I arrived at around midnight and was still greeted in a friendly manner. There are a variety of different topping selections for the tacos and they are fairly priced at $3. The tacos are also filled with very generous portions. Another key aspect of this place is the service. It has a friendly atmosphere and my server came over many times to refill drinks and chips and salsa. My favorite part of the tacos was easily the sauce. The pineapple salsa is to die for and it really adds that moisture necessary for a perfect mix of toppings. I greatly enjoyed my visit and will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can believe in global warming simply because Barrio's tacos are always cold.   Seriously, why are the tacos always cold?  Two thumbs up (and two stars) for the queso though."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good reasonably priced taco,  Barrio is the place. The service at the bar was good,  not outstanding but good.  They have a large selecting of beer and Jameson on tap, that's a first.  As usual Mexican style restaurants they give your some chips and salsa to munch on. The chips were ok, seemed slightly old but had a good salt.   What you go here for are amazing tacos at $3 - $4 each,  build your own or choose from their house selection.   I wish I had a Barrio near home."}
{"text":"Great location! Service is wonderful despite how busy it can get. Friendly and delicious!"}
{"text":"The chips are awesome. The salsa is great. The thai-chili tofu is amazing. The draft beer selection is impressive. Yes, the tacos are cold, but it has never bothered me or anyone I've brought with me.  I've logged the most hours at the Lakewood location since it's a short walk from my current place but in terms of food the original Tremont location and newer Gateway location are just as good.  One of the reasons I love Barrio so much is because I can eat for around the same price that a beer costs. It is easily one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have yet to find the right combo of ingredients for a taco that could result in a hot taco. First try, I thought the taco was ice cold because of the toppings I chose. Second try, I ordered warm or hot toppings, hoping to avoid the ice cold taco. Still cold.  Decent beer selection but the bar service is poor to non-existent"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place and glad we did tacos are awesome and service was top notch my daughter has dairy allergies and they made sure it wasn't an issue my only complaint is its 500 miles from home and we probably won't be back for a while"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland! There happy hour is amazing as well. A must go if you are in town"}
{"text":"I have always been happy with the food at the Barrio restaurants. Recently, I booked the taco truck for a birthday party. The guys on the truck were so helpful and friendly, the food was fantastic, and our guests were thrilled! The entire experience was seamless and Jake (VP Operations) was awesome through the whole process."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere !!  Love the selection and variety of tacos/toppings - rice is also delicious  The pork is amazing!   Service was a tad slow, but they were super slammed - my friends and I sat at the bar, the company was great so we did not mind a little bit of a wait at all.   I brought some tacos home to my husband and they were perfectly tasty reheated :)"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the only star I gave was because our server was nice.   History: We visited Barrio, Tremont during its first months open, and had a terrible experience. The food was bland and cold, and our server was subpar, to say the least. We never had any intention of going back. We know what doesn't work for our palette pretty quickly and generally just won't patronize as opposed to giving bad written reviews.  Now, a couple of years and locations later, we decide Wednesday night, mainly through lack of close late night eating options to give Barrio Lakewood a chance. We knew we should have just gone home and cooked, but we did this to ourselves anyway. Like I said, our server was fine, she got her 20% on the original order sum as opposed to 20% on the sum we ended up paying after we had half of the tacos sent back, but that food; no other word than disgusting. I suppose this being Ohio, you can get away with calling yourselves a taco spot, but serve tacos with no flavor of any sort and still be a \"hot spot\", which is shameful, but whatever.   When I say bland, I mean bland in that not only was there no Latin flavor to these tacos, there wasn't even the American taco flavor that you can pick up from a supermarket. These were what I imagine a British or Irish taco would taste like. Just nothing but old chopped tomatoes, watery lettuce, and meat boiled in plain water served on a cold flour tortilla.  Barrio was THOROUGHLY  unimpressive, bordering on offensive. Compound that with their pre-mixed, heavy on the bottled sour, \"margaritas\", I'm mad at ourselves for even putting us in the position to give Barrio a chance to prove us so right about our first impressions and sentiments. I'd recommend going to just about ANY other taco spot but this one, unless you like bland food. In that case, party!!!  *6 tacos ordered. 3 sent back, 2 taken with, 2 minus one bite tacos thrown away at home. Total consumption withstood, 1 taco, 4 bites of 5 other other tacos sent back or discarded, tongue still recovering from sour burn a la single margarita withstood*"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait... even though it was an hour and a half. Service was great and the tacos were amazing! Tried both the beef and chicken- so good! As well as the guac, cheese dip and margs!"}
{"text":"The margaritas are a little pricey, and they aren't quality for the price. But the queso is excellent, and the build your own taco is neat. I do like all the options they have, and the decor is cool. Not my favorite, but when my friends want to go I'll tagalong."}
{"text":"I wish I could go to a Barrio at least once and have my taco be warm... I don't even order salsa on it. Just cheese and meat or veggies, so I'm not sure what else to do. The queso is always fantastic! It is the only thing that I return for. Margaritas? Forget it.... Why should I pay an insane amount for sour mix? The staff is decent I suppose. Much better here in Treemont than Lakewood. But they always seem understaffed, even during the slow periods. I know this review will be over looked, and they probably won't change anything. I just wanted them to know they aren't doing the best job the could."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the one in Tremont but this location is great! I've been three times and gotten completely different tacos each time. This is the perfect place for me because I have a really hard time deciding what I want to order at restaurants.  I tend to want a little bit of everything.  With tacos (Happy Dog Style) I can have everything I want!  The last time I discovered the Stoner (hard taco wrapped with a soft taco with queso and chorizo in between) and the Green Goddess (hard taco wrapped with a soft taco with queso and guac in between).  Holy cow, do yourself a favor and get one of each."}
{"text":"The build your own taco is my kinda thing, great food quality, great service. I recommend this place"}
{"text":"It's a nice (formerly-) hipsterish spot in Tremont with good food.  If you were weirded out by the hipster servers before, they've all gone to the new Hot Dog place in North Olmsted.  Try out the guac and tacos of the day--some very peculiar choices, but nearly always a home run."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but I just can't. I'd rather get a mystery taco from Taco Bell than eat this slop. Their tacos are always cold and thrown together like a 5 year old made them. I once went there after a night of bar hopping with my husband and our best friend. Needless to say, I ordered two tacos, ate half of one and immediately rushed to the bathroom. Watery spit while taking what would be the last bite of my taco, was an indication that I was going to vomit all over the fancy women's bathroom."}
{"text":"Barrio is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Lakewood, or the west side in general. My go to is always the El Jefe taco.  Probably the single best taco I've ever enjoyed. Actually craving some barrio right about now...."}
{"text":"My sister was in from out of town and was very excited to come back to Barrio one of her favorite spots. When we walked in and asked for a table for three on a not so busy Sunday afternoon we felt as if it was closing time and we asked for a table for 12. So right away we didn't feel like it was a warm welcome. She said our server would be right with us and 15 minutes later we finally got a server. (I have to say my one star is for the guy who brought the chips he could gather from our faces we were not having a good experience  and was loading us up with chips) 20 min later she came back with waters after we asked our friend (chip guy) for waters.  The food was great I will say but we got a total of four tacos and it took about 45 minutes. During that 45 min our server was no where to be found. I understand when it's busy I've worked in the service industry but it was no where near Barrio packed. We had been done with our 4 tacos for 10 or 15 minutes and me chip guy was on his a game and cleared off our table for us. As our server was circling the restaurant looking like she needed something to do aka bring us our check! She then disappeared to the kitchen and we finally said something to another server who seemed busy but he stopped and went to go find our check. Which we appreciated but 10 min later we finally got the check, paid cash and got the hell out of there. Don't think we will be back for awhile."}
{"text":"My husband and I live in Tremont, and frequently stop for Happy Hour dinner and drinks because the food is great and the prices are low enough that we can afford a weekly trip.  Love the \"build your own taco\" concept - so fun!  For those who don't want to put thought into it, they also have tacos they suggest that they can make for you.  We've been here enough that we've tried almost everything on the menu; my husband loves the pineapple salsa and I love the corn salsa.  Oddly, one of our most favorite things at this place is the free salsa they put in front of you when you sit down.  It actually might be working against them, because I love love love guacamole but never order it here since their free salsa is the most delicious appetizer of all!  Really not joking, its my favorite salsa, idk if its just me, but I like it better than any Mexican restaurant salsa I've ever had.    My only negative comments are that I wish they had a bigger beer selection and that I wish they would tone down the onion and garlic in their tacos or add more options for those who don't enjoy those flavors.  Not bad enough that it ruins the food, bc obviously I keep going back, but I would never go here if I had something important going on the next day; that flavor lingers long after you brush your teeth!"}
{"text":"Barrio is always so tasty and filling, and it won't break the bank. Our new past-time is to get a giant bag of Barrio to go and then nibble on pure deliciousness at the Metroparks Zoo. Two favorites in one! Their fish of the day special is always super fresh and seared perfectly, and I like that they serve something other than tilapia. So glad CLE has Barrio!"}
{"text":"Very cheap, very good tacos. The interior design of this place is also very unique and cool. Great outdoor patio as well. I got two specialty tacos and they were delicious. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been to the lakewood location several times and always had a great experience. The atmosphere, food and drinks are always excellent.   They have a list of taco suggestions to chose from which are delicious. If you don't have a high tolerance for spicy food (like myself!) I would suggest making your own taco. They have so many great ingredients to choose from, I haven't made a combo yet that I didn't love. The taco suggestions are great but most of them are quite spicy.  Also of note, if you love guacamole as much as I do, they have unique guac combos which change everyday. They also have a green goddess taco shell- with guac sandwiched between the two shells- which is a great addition to any taco. I would highly suggest barrio to anyone in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for tacos. My wife and I eat here at least once a month. The food has been excellent every time. I am a big fan of the coca-cola marinated steak and the chorizo for your protein choice. The stoner and green goddess shell/tortilla choices are so tasty. Their margaritas are delicious, definitely a big fan of the mango. The only downside is that they are almost always busy. That is certainly a testament to how good they are. Barrio is definitely not your average American-Mexican restaurant, it is a big step beyond."}
{"text":"First Barrio experience.  The only negative is that there's no reservations and you will have a wait. Bathrooms also pretty small.  Besides that, everything else is top notch. Got the mango house margs - so good. Not overwhelmingly sweet, not too strong.  Chips - just get the queso. Such a good pre-meal compliment with the margs.  Tacos - It's why you come here. Got the Taco of the Month, a pork and pineapple with some heat, as well as an El Jefe. Both were insanely good."}
{"text":"I am absolutely in love with Barrio!!! I held off on going there for months until coworkers told me I had to go. Since then, I have been several times and have enjoyed both. The prices are affordable and the dips and salsas are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Barrio never fails. Every location is great, every meal is great, 98% of the staff is amazing. Mackin at this location is always there with a smile, as are every other server, hostess, and bartender. The prices can't be beat and neither can the selection. If you screw up a taco it's because you're being overzealous. There isn't a bad thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I go to a Barrio at least once a week .. And we usually have a pleasant experience. I felt like I had to mention this one particular experience in Tremont, however, as it was very poor. We felt like everyone working (especially our waiter waiting on bar area tables) did not want to be there. There were several points where I made eye contact with him (we needed something) and he kept waking basically ignoring me, because he was so busy. I hate feeling like I'm being a bother bc a server is too busy .. And we were definitely made to feel like that. The food was also not up to par, as it usually is. I will stick to downtown and Lakewood."}
{"text":"We LOVED our first time Barrio experience! Such a cute little spot with amazing food! The guac and queso were so great .. And the waitress even gave us chips and a little more guac to take home! The drink and taco selections were really fun and unique. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The crispy fried tofu is unrivaled, the cocktail menu is better than one might expect, and the french toast at brunch is my favorite french toast ever."}
{"text":"You can't beat $2 happy hour tacos at the bar only! The selection includes everything from braised beef to jicama-strawberry-salsa for toppings.  Tons of different types of salsa and aioli!  Great place to just hang out in Tremont, especially on their Patio!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday (a lot different birthday experience than the one for El Tango for another birthday member). It was a Wednesday night about 8:30 and there was a 30 minute wait for a table. the place was hopping with a fairly big hipster crowd. The weather was great and we waited outside. Once we were seated our server was fairly prompt with our order. the three of us had a mix of tacos and most of them were very good. Dirty taco was pretty darn good, as was the chorizo taco. For me the only taco that i didn't care for was one i created with pineapple based salso. Not their fault, i just didn't care for the salsa. But the place was pretty nifty looking inside, the clientele  definitely had a high hipster quotient. I am definitely now in the hipster age bracket (I also am not necessarily a fan of hipsters), but everyone was very solid. The staff was okay, not great or highly personable, but professional enough that it didn't put any negative spin on my experience. The ambiance was very good. I would think this place really hops on a weekend night. If you do get one of their hotter tacos make sure to have plenty of liquid beverages around because some of the tacos are very hot.  I definitely would go there again. I didn't have a margarita this time, but next time i go i will give it a shot."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon and still had to wait for 30 minutes for a table which I think is a good sign!  It was packed but our food was out quickly, although lukewarm.  Since we had to wait for a table we had margaritas at the bar and they were great and very colorful!  The concept of make your own taco is a great one.  Unlike at burger places where there are so many choices and you have to think critically about which cheese goes with which toppings, everything on Barrio's menu would go together if you pick one from each section.  They also have pre-designed tacos for those of you that are indecisive!  I'll definitely be going again next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I visit this location each time I come in town.  Food has been good! As of late, I've noticed so many things have changed the chorizo is actually sweet it doesn't even resemble mexican chorizo I've eaten everywhere else.  In fact, most tacos I have ordered making them as spicy as possible come out sweet and COLD-how does chorizo or steak with cilantro/lime sauce, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese and hot sauce make sweet? I sent back the cold tacos (the server said I put too many toppings on it?? Since when is 4 toppings and hot salsa an excuse for a cold taco?)  The meat was ice cold, he even touched it and agreed.  The 2nd batch came out, cold again...put the meat in the microwave at this point please!  I didn't say anything again just ate the cold meat taco...I keep hoping the next time I come it will change and was just a fluke but this is the 2nd or 3rd time with cold sweet tacos...bummer it's time to move on.  P.S. I think the salsa may have changed too it's kind of bland and milky looking not that fresh vibrant red green color it used to be."}
{"text":"Barrio is the most bad ass taco/margarita place in the entire world. I am from Atlanta, but have family up there and Barrio changed my life forever, for the better.  It all started with an El Diablo maragarita, that I thought had a cayenne rim, but later found out it was a mixture of highly addictive coke and the essence of the Devil harvested by Jesus after he kicked the Devil's ass.  The tacos were so amazing, that they literally altered my DNA making me immune to diabetes and allowing my body to survive only on Barrio tacos. My dark soul was also restored after my first experience here, and I am left a loving and compassionate person with the spark in my life back forever.  Not only that, it altered my brain to think about Barrio 4 times a day: 1. Before breakfast. 2. Before lunch 3. Before dinner 4. Any time while pooping inferior tacos from anywhere else, as my body reminds me that I should have chosen Barrio.  I have postpartum depression now from being 800 miles away from this establishment, but take great solace in the fact that I will attend Barrio, possibly twice a day, every time I'm in Cleveland visiting family.  Thank you for not only providing me with epic drinks and mouth-watering, tortilla-filled goodness, but also for giving me hope and restoring balance to the universe.   I would give this place 100/5 stars if I could. Anyone rating this below 5 stars are fibbers and over-entitled, a-holes."}
{"text":"I have been to Barrio exactly twice- once, about three days after they opened, and yesterday. I am so, so pleased with the positive changes that have been made there. Whereas the service was once sorely lacking, they have really stepped their game up. My server yesterday was very kind and accommodating when I screwed up part of my own order, even offering a free drink while I waited. She was very attentive, always making sure our glasses were full and our table was cleared. This is a great place for vegetarians/vegans, as they have many great non-meat options, however, no vegan cheese is offered. The beer selection is very good, but more importantly, the cocktails are fabulous! You have to try the Sassafras Park (root beer & Basil Hayden's). There still seem to be some bugs that need worked out in the kitchen, and I do believe once that happens, Barrio will become the regular Taco Tuesday spot."}
{"text":"The tacos are flavorful and filling! I usually have to stop after two and I consider myself a large eater.  They always have new and interesting guacamoles. If available, I would definitely give the watermelon guac a try!!"}
{"text":"I wish they were open for lunch more often. Create your own taco. Brilliant."}
{"text":"I have had two very nice happy hour experiences here. However, when we went there for dinner we sat for over 10 minutes without anyone coming over to take a drink order or to assure us that our server would be with us eventually. Unfortunate because I'm sure with service we would have enjoyed dinner and drinks...but we had to leave and go to Touch where we could get service (Touch's tacos were very good)."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy paying $5 for a cold taco while surrounded by douche-bag hipsters sipping craft-brewed India Piss Ales, and listening to 'Chad' talk about where he got his latest 'tribal' full-sleeve tattoo, how much it hurt to get, while sending selfies to everyone at the table?  This is your place, then.  ...It's shame they don't include \"Make my food hot\" as on option on the order cards you fill out for your taco(s), in what can only be described as the Mexican version of Happy-Dog, where, incidentally, they know how to keep food warm.  Here's an idea:  They have other stores that sell food; They're called grocers. Go there, buy all the same ingredients for tacos (and maybe a beer that is NOT an IPA), go home and prepare tacos, save yourself a few bucks, put your cell-phone down for five fucking minutes (I promise the Internet will still be there when you get back) and have a conversation with someone that won't leave you bleeding out your ears at the end of it."}
{"text":"Had for the first time last night. Fantastic food!! Ingredients were very fresh and flavorful. Will be back frequently."}
{"text":"As an administrative assistant I've ordered hundreds of catering meals and the meal that we received from Barrio was not only the best meal I've EVER ordered it was also the one of the most professional exchanges with a restaurant I've ever had.   We ordered a catered meal (the 3 meat option) for 20. The meal was on time (actually early!), and it was WILDLY popular with everyone. They definitely do NOT skimp on the sauces, queso, and guac. Everyone raved about the pulled pork.   The delivery person helped set up the meal and brought everything that we could possibly need. Even though this restaurant does many catering orders, every email I sent with questions/logistics etc. was responded to within minutes.  I wish I could order every catering meal from here, but our company likes \"diversity\" with their meals. However, any time they want tacos we will most certainly be ordering from here."}
{"text":"The service...the staff and food are fantastic...the beer list is fantastic and they have so many good bourbon's to choose from"}
{"text":"I love Barrio for a quick bite - the tacos are cheap and the margs are good. Although sometimes it's not \"quick\" if you go at prime time and have to wait for a table, but we live nearby and are usually there on off days.   The service is usually the downfall of this place - the servers are nice enough but are usually forgetful and can be a bit slow. So if you're there on a Friday night, you'll need to be patient. I recommend sitting at the bar if you're with a small group, you'll get better attention. Just my two cents.  The build-your-own taco concept is fun and Barrio offers a lot of delicious options. The tacos are so good you feel like you're stealing them for $3, but that's why I love it. It's a great value and a really tasty night out. That said, we are repeat customers!"}
{"text":"I stopped in last night and ordered a few tacos. The Spiced Marinated Chicken was good. However, it was served on a cold tortilla. Yup, a cold tortilla. Who wants to eat a cold taco? I don't understand. Why would anyone NOT heat tortillas?   For future reference, warm tortillas do make a difference and only takes 3 seconds to heat!"}
{"text":"In the mood for chips and tacos?  Then head to Barrio.    My first experience here was with the bf after a day of tailgaiting, which brought on some serious munchies.  Two tacos and a glass of sangria later, I was more than happy with my full tummy of delicious eats.  And no - this wasn't just a clouded judgement call or because I was so incredibly hungry - this place is that good.  The set up kind of takes cue from Happy Dog - you order by taking a sheet and filling in the little bubbles next to the items you want.  Each taco is $3 and made to order - can't really beat it.  Lots of different wraps, fillings and toppings to create our very own or if you're too lazy try one of the tacos of the dia (I'm leaving that because while I was thinking day, dia is what came out - my Mexican food craving as I write this is literally taking over my body).  Anyways, not only are the tacos great but the chips are addicting, and so is the guac.  I'm warning you - you won't be able to stop eating them.    Now you can't have a taco without a margarita, and fear not - there are plenty to choose from.  I just stick to the classic, but I've heard the flavored ones are pretty damn good.  There's also a full bar stocked with spirits, wine, and beer if you're looking for something else.  The vibe is laid back and fun and there's a great little patio for the warmer weather (or day drinking).  I will warn that the place is a little cramped and can feel pretty tight on a Friday or Saturday night, but it definitely won't ruin your time.  We've also tried a large group and it's worked out, but not with some slight hiccups.  I would call ahead to make sure they can accommodate your party without having to split you up (we were eventually able to get a table for all of our party of 10, in case you were wondering). Besides, you'll be too busy drinking, talking, and eating to notice."}
{"text":"I was excited for Barrio because the Tremont area is lacking in Mexican food options. Unfortunately I was a bit underwhelmed. The \"a la carte\" taco theme is a really good idea, but some of the ingredients just don't go together. The ambiance is really awesome though and the margs were pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from SoCal and wanted to try some local Mexican fare. It was happy hour but we chose to sit at a regular table. Jay, our server, was amazing. He pulled up a chair and spent time going over the taco ordering process and drink menu. I've had servers who have been attentive and patient with a newcomer, but Jay went above and beyond. He has the kind of personality that's fun and engaging but not over the top and pushy. NOTE: If you're expecting Cal/Mex taco experience, this is NOT the place. Nor should it be. We appreciated a Midwest spin rather than posing as something they are not. The Tuscan guacamole was awesome and I never expected pine nuts, sundried tomatoes and balsamic to taste so good on top of guac.  I had one bean and rice taco and one pulled pork taco. They were both delicious. I'll admit the flour tortillas were a little strange (we're accustomed to warm corn torts as a vessel) but Jay expertly explained that due to the nature of service, it just wasn't efficient to heat up corn tortillas as fast they would need them; however, he did offer to do this since we were there before the rush began. Also the tortillas they use are larger than your typical 6\" corn tort and anything larger in corn is rare. So, thank you Jay, for making our Barrio maiden voyage so enjoyable!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Cleveland hands down. Not only are the tacos very good and prepared in a timely fashion, but the staff is youthful, polite, and makes sure your experience is worthwhile.   The salsa + chips at the beginning is nice (and possibly the best salsa I've ever had), and the process of ordering is well thought out and refreshing. The many different combinations of ingredients you can put into your taco is impressive, and I have yet to have a less than amazing experience with the food.   The staff is very kind, and they realize that the restaurant is small and hectic. They help you out in any way you need, and make it feel like you are their only customer that night.   It gets crowded easily, so either set up a reservation or get there early! If all else fails, it will definitely be worth the wait."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love Barrio, I live 5 minutes walking distance from the place, and find myself there quite a bit for happy hour after work.   The food is awesome, the drinks are great, and for the most part the atmosphere is very welcoming. The best thing about Barrio is the price you pay for what you get, it has to be the best priced [good] food in Lakewood, bar none.   My issue though is with the bar service...yes I am usually there for happy hour, and they are slammed busy, but It is damn near impossible to make eye contact with the bartenders. They just look down and rush past you, I sat down tonight and could not make eye contact or at least get a \"Hello, be right with you\" for ten minutes.   Well, no big deal I use that time to decide what tacos, and drinks I am going to get for the night, and I get some service, place my order, and get my beer. All is good.  Roughly 15 minutes later a large group of girls congregates next to where I am sitting, and my bartender starts taking orders for shots, and margaritas and whatever else. I look at the clock because my beer is nearing its end, and I want to get another drink under their happy hour special, because if you didn't already know their happy hour kicks ass.  Well here I am again at 6:51 (according to the clock next to the bar) trying to make eye contact with my bartender who is pouring shots, and making margaritas for the group next to me, and I can't seem to get his attention. So finally I kindly interrupt his flow, and ask if I could get a happy hour margarita when he gets a chance. His response was I am not sure what time it is...it was 6:56 according to that bar clock I mentioned earlier...its not like we had seconds to spare before happy hour ended. But a girl he was serving blurts out \"It is seven on the dot\"  So because the bartender was too lazy to turn his head 90 degrees to the right so he could check the time, he listens to some other patron at the bar. He then looked at me and said \"Sorry Buddy\" and walked away before I even got a word out.   I was extremely pissed at this point, and contemplated what exactly I should do. Should I not tip? Should I ask for a manager? Should I never eat Barrios delicious tacos again? Ahhh...none of the above. I'll just hop on Yelp and make a review to get it out there. I was pretty bummed on Barrio tonight, but I might be back, maybe I just need to check out the other locations.  Also, thanks Barrio staff for driving me to do my first yelp review!"}
{"text":"I refuse to go back to the downtown location. I always have a great experience at the Tremont and Lakewood locations, but never at the downtown location. Last time I was there I was with a group of friends. We waited an hour plus for a table on a Friday night. We had no problem with that because we ordered some drinks at the bar. 45 minutes go by and our table is ready, not! They made a 'mistake' and our table wasn't ready. We all had seats at the bar and got up because we thought our table was ready. 20-30 minutes go by our table was ready. Then we get the worst server. His name was Jae. He was so rude and disrespectful. He tried to pick a fight. Blaming my friend for saying something about his friend server, which she was also rude. Nothing was ever said. On top of all of that we got soggy tacos."}
{"text":"That was fun! My wife had a couple of versions of the fish taco and I had a couple of versions of the pulled pork. Since it was \"build your own\" -- what's not to love?  The drinks were good -- the service was very good and the food was amazing. My favorite part though- was the place and the people. It was electric with people everywhere - but it never felt too crowded. We will be back again and again.  Didn't get five stars - because I didn't LOVE the guacamole. It was ok - but it didn't blow my hair back -- otherwise it was a great experience. I will be taking friends and clients and family there for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for about a year. I've hear great reviews and was super excited.  To start is a very small location there barely for your drinks chips salsa and dinner. Still excited I grabbed the menu card and started to create my very own taco.. i put my order in and wait.. my tacos come out .. 1 stoner and 1 regular beef.  I was not impressed at all in fact very disappointed  on the stoner it had a Cinnamon taste to it and I asked the waitress what was used to make it she had no clue.. she even said  it should have Cinnamon but who knows what the cook does. Needless to say in did not finish my meal was was very disappointed.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Whats up guys!    Short and sweet I may drink there but my taste buds are sobering me up to the fact that your food is starting to slip into a chasm- A rift.     Be very careful. People do come there for the food as well for the drinks!"}
{"text":"Love it here! Food is awesome, except for the white rice, but that's not a big deal. Everything else is great."}
{"text":"I haven been with my wife here, last week, it was one of the bext place to be have relax drink and tasty taco/chips/salsa..wow what a taste for the price you pay   I would go back very soon..."}
{"text":"This review is about my dining experience on Saturday. Its not my personal problem but I had over heard the confrontation and I that's why I'm writing today. Myself and my friend were eating in the front corner and we enjoyed our food and drinks as usual! What there was a brief confrontation at the bar area with two ladies and the make bartender. He had long brown grungy looking hair. He was short and I think he may have had a beard. Any who the ladies didn't want the food so they walked out. At this time the cops were walking in. Next thing I know the cops were brought the ladies back in.  I really couldn't hear any exchange of words until I was in the midst of going to the bathroom. I heard the bartender say pay for the fuckin chips! And I was astonished. It was unbelievable to me. I was so disgusted by this time I was no longer interested and anything. I use to work in a restaurant and no matter how wrong a guest is, you never talk to a customer like that ever!!!! I'm no longer going to this location I'll travel the extra length to Lakewood to get my fix."}
{"text":"Excellent food options and great margaritas. Fresh tasty ,fun place to be. Beats all the other taco type places."}
{"text":"I stood at the bar right in front of two bartenders with my order card for at least 3 minutes, and I wasn't acknowledged. One served a guy immediately who came up behind me two minutes after me. The other bartender continued washing glasses and talking to someone about nothing. Finally I ASKED if I could please place an order. I have been waiting and waiting for 20 minutes for my to go stuff, No tip for them. I am furious."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  The grouper tacos are outstanding and pork was great too. Seriously fresh ingredients. Chips, queso and guacamole yum!  Enjoyed my favorite blood orange margarita with sugar on the rim!   Great value too.  My daughter's first stop after coming home from a 4 month stay in Spain was Barrio! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"awesome tacos. disappointed with the bar service- we felt rushed and they got our drinks wrong twice. will definitely come back but probably will stick to sitting at a table"}
{"text":"Every single time income here I leave happy. Tacos are fantastic, chips/salsa is great, the vibe is good and the drinks are strong. Happy hour is a beast so try it out. I eat here at LEAST once a week. The art on the wall is interesting, a game is always on and the patio is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I walked over from the Greyhound station on Chester at about 11 pm.   Barrio was busy then -- for sure the bar was full.  The service was terrific.   I had the Vegan Stoner and Curd Ferguson.  The latter had pineapple salsa, jicama apple slaw, and salsa.   So it was tasty, but I have to say that all the cold, wet ingredients made eating it a cool, wet mess.    Everything was very tasty, and I'd go again."}
{"text":"The hard part is finding the right combination of taco that you like (takes a few visits) - since there are a lot of topping options and an ingredient you choose may or may not work. Once you do - though - you'll keep going back.   Good salsa also.   The wait times for tacos can be a bit long when they are busy."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding taqueria. The tacos are large and delicious. When we went, the place was packed and we had a 20 minute. No problem, on Tuesdays, there are margarita specials, and Barrio has some really good margarita offerings, which are served in mason jars.  Ordering is done on a pre-printed tablet like you find in sushi bars. You can pick from a variety of a la carte tacos, or you can build your own. They have about a half dozen sides to go with your tacos.  I ordered 3 tacos and 2 sides. I was stuffed, and I am not a small man. The servers were friendly  and engaging. The decor was Mexican Death (skeletons). The atmosphere was boisterous, and everyone was having a good time.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Very slow service  & prices were high in my opinion. The food was only ok. The decor and atmosphere was the best part."}
{"text":"Love...Love...Love.. This joint.  Absolutely best place if you want some good Mexican tacos.  This is a 2 to 3 times a month trip and we drive a half hour.  Love the Blood orange margaritas.  They keep replenishing your chips and salsa until their falling out your ears.  Honestly what a great place and concept.  Never had a bad meal.  Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"The best place...great atmosphere, awesome tacos and great margaritas...definitely try the blood orange...wife and I go to this place at least twice a month... You will definitely not be disappointed....check out all their locations..."}
{"text":"Yes and yes. Amazing flavors, fast service. I absolutely loved this place. I took a star away because our table was sticky. Lol. But we will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Barrio on a Saturday night.  We were seated right away and our waitress was very friendly.  We both ordered margaritas which were very good (as were the chips and salsa...)  The atmosphere and decor was pretty cool as well.  We both ordered 3 tacos and an order of queso to share - The tacos were OK, but nothing amazing and the queso wasn't quite as good as we were hoping. My tacos were actually kind of cold.  Also, it was hard to situate all of the food on our table (the high top tables by the bar are really crowded for all of the \"stuff\" that is on your table).  It wasn't a bad experience, but if we were to go back, it would probably just be for a margarita or 2 and some chips and salsa."}
{"text":"NEW BRUNCH!!!!!!!!  The new brunch is fantastic. The same great atmosphere and delicious Margs with new great food. The shrimp and grits bowl and the chimi taco is outstanding. As Always the staff is personable and friendly. Will be back next week"}
{"text":"These are my favorite tacos anywhere.  It is one of the places I hit whenever I come back home to Cleveland from Tampa.  The Green Goddess shell is amazing with a perfect combination of their guac and queso between a crunchy and soft shell.  The beer selection is great.  My entire family loves coming to this place.  There is usually a wait but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos in Cleveland! I consider myself a taco enthusiast and I cannot say enough about Barrio's menu. I would definitely recommend the stoner (hard shell dipped in queso  and wrapped in a soft shell), the Tuscan guac (traditional guac with balsamic, feta, sundried tomatoes and Italian herbs) and the cilantro & lime aioli (great on every taco and even for dipping tortilla chips). Great 4pm-7pm Happy Hour as well!  Entire menu is affordable & filling, service is always great, and can't beat the central Tremont location."}
{"text":"People hype this up for no reason. It's for teenagers and college kids. It's loud, and very busy. Exceptional service is not their strongpoint."}
{"text":"I had some tacos, they were ok. I might try it one more time but I was pretty unimpressed. The onions/peppers topping was so greasy that the grease was running out of the taco. The tofu protein choice was just a handful of little breaded and fried dice-sized pieces that just tasted like chewy fried whatevers. They are supposed to have some sort of chili flavor, but I could not detect it. I liked the guacamole,  the Barrio Secret Taco Sauce (hot), the nice servers, and the atmosphere of the restaurant.  I would suggest adding fresh onions/peppers as a topping, soft corn tortillas, and regular tofu with seasoning instead of the little fried things."}
{"text":"Good, fun place. No liquor on Sundays, just beer and wine. I talked with the owner after ordering one of their guacamole dips, he said they make everything in house, fresh. Good beer selection. Cool art on the walls too!"}
{"text":"These tacos are the bomb!!! The restaurant is cool. We were a larger group and only I had been there before. This led to some confusion in ordering and happy hour vs regular pricing."}
{"text":"$3 Tacos and cheap drinks.  This place is awesome.  Service is slow but you deal with that by pregaming at Shooters all day.  When you're hammered you don't notice slow service."}
{"text":"Love making my own tacos and interesting combinations! They have a great patio too in the summertime. Usually pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights. It is a super casual place- Definitely recommend it for weekend fun."}
{"text":"Always a fun spot to go to...this place stays busy for a reason. Love the variety of tacos and the Blood Orange Margarita. Also has a great happy hour!  Thanks Forrest for the great service this afternoon!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, novel concept, cheap.  This is one of my all time favorite places.  The tacos are amazing but may take you a few rounds to figure out your exact preferences.  The food is a great value and you have total dominion over what goes on your tacos.  I haven't had a bad trip yet and don't expect I will."}
{"text":"We had the Barrio food truck for our grad party. It really added the \"cool\" factor. Everyone loves Barrio. And the  employees on the truck are top notch."}
{"text":"Would strongly recommend Jae! He's a very good waiter and made a potentially negative experience very positive. He saw that my boyfriend and I were stuck in the back of the restaurant next to a loud table and he moved us into a quieter table. He was also more than willing to answer any of my questions regarding my peanut/shell fish allergies. I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Barrio, I still love you, but I had to update my review after my recent takeout order. I highly suggest NOT getting takeout here! Eating in will be quicker and easier. My SO and I ordered three tacos to go. We were told 15 minutes and we hovered around the bar because we didn't want to take up stools that someone might want to sit and eat or drink at (it was fairly busy; not insane, but a good number of people). After 35 minutes, I had to tell the bartender that if the food wasn't coming soon I would have to cancel. I felt awful, but the 15 minute estimate was so far off. It seems like they just aren't very well-equipped to handle carry out service. I will be doing dine-in only from here on out!"}
{"text":"Awesome Brunch spot if you want tacos, tequila and some killer salsa. We went to Barrio for the first time and was very pleased. The El Puerco and El Jefe are awesome choices if you like savory and sweet. I did try the Crab Cake taco last time and was not a fan so I'm pretty much sticking to what I know. The blood orange margarita is also yummy so I highly recommend getting margarita when you visit."}
{"text":"Really amazing tacos. Good margarita too.  The ordering process was interesting.  You essentially fill out a check list of what kind of taco you want and how many.  They could have explained it a little better when you first sit down, because it wasn't immediately clear how their system works.   Other than that, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Have been to this location for happy hour and every time was a wonderful experience!  Friendly staff, strong margaritas, and great food.  You can't beat 2 margaritas and 2 made to order tacos for under $15 (happy hour prices)!!"}
{"text":"Margaritas were solid, tacos were delicious, atmosphere is energizing."}
{"text":"This kicks every taco shop I have been to straight to the curb.  First of all, I am not from Cleveland, I am an Indy gal.  I recently got to experience a tip of what Cleveland has to offer and surprise surprise this was on the first nights stop.  We went out for a few drinks and then wante d agreat late night snack.  Where do I begin.  I know that lots of people talk about this place but for me someone who loves tacos this was heaven!! I got their veggie taco for a late night snack.  The price was absolutely amazing for the size of these tacos.  Let me just say that I am really glad that I did not buy two.  The size is massive considering it is just a few dollars for each taco.  The veggies were fresh and the taco made a memorable impact on me!  I love these tacos and will be going back to visit everytime I make my way to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"food: amazing, full of flavor, soft on your wallet  and great quality cocktails: inventive and strong  and, if i was grading based on these two qualities, the place would surely get a 4 or 5. but, DEAR LORD the service is atrocious. you'd think my beau and i were asking our server to donate her kidney to one of us from the look we got when asked for silverware, water, and a refill on chips. chips that we specifically ordered a side of guacamole for.  i will however, say that there is one mystery server who, when he waited on the table next to use told them the specials and gave them a carafe of water. we had no idea specials even existed...  when i went back a few nights later with a friend and sat at the bar, the service was just as poor.  i'll absolutely come back to barrio. the food is amazing, the drinks are top notch, and it's walking distance from my house. but i will not go in to barrio expecting great, timely service. and i certainly wont go in when i'm hungry/crabby and want my chips and salsa refill with a smile."}
{"text":"My 1st time here, drinks were ok little smaller than other places I've been. I did enjoy the build your own tacos a tad juicy but very tasteful"}
{"text":"Very interesting decor and fabulous food. Love the unique idea of the build your own tacos on little slips of paper. The salsa and margueritas are soo good. Good value also."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, really good house-made sauce at a great price. Good beer selection also for the beer snobs like myself."}
{"text":"This is literally the best tacos Ive ever had.  The drinks were great too!  Not too keen on the actual margarita, but everything else was amazing.  I ordered some very unusual tacos (tofu, smoked cheddar, mango salsa, etc) and it was amazing.  We had never heard of this place until a friend recommended it and will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Interesting take on tacos. Nicely priced, about 3-4 dollars a taco and they can be stacked with ingredients. Follows a model of creating your own off a menu pad and golf pencils from selections. Some ingredients require an upgrade of $1, the taco shell upgrades are worth it, particularly the green goodness and stoner. It did through me off at first too that the ingredients may be cold on the taco, making it seem like it's a cold taco, but it's all based on what you order, such as the sauces and some of the lettuce.  They also have a huge beer selection with lots of local beers. Margaritas and other cocktails too, however I found the pitcher of regular margs to be watered down."}
{"text":"It has been three days and I am still unnerved about the tacos and the service I had....lets start with the service. A bartender too busy to make eye contact for ten or fifteen minutes gives us menus to fill out, we had to finally ask him, \"would it be alright if we placed our order now?\" after a second interminable wait. He grimaced and said it might take a sec.  But forget the service...they took our orders, which included refried beans and it was not until our food actually came out that we were told refried beans (they offer two kinds) are no longer offered because they were, \"drying out too much.\"  So, the ambiance is awesome. Truly a marvel, very beautiful and authentically Mexican decor. It may be the coolest feeling dining room I've ever been in.  The food----seriously!!!!!! $3 bucks per taco---one little bite of meat and a hardly filled and very not heated up shell. Whether you get crunchy or soft, (we got both) they will be cold shells. The chicken, you had to keep picking the cartilidge out of your mouth. The beef, it was so stringy it all came out in one bite and only the hungriest diner would bother to chew it long enough to get it into your eating tube. The pork was best, tho it was lukewarm and you begin to wonder about health and safety.  Do not go there to eat. Go there to hang out, have a drink (their margaritas are mainly triple sec) so get a top shelf margarita and some friends but do not order food."}
{"text":"I had never been here before but liked the vibe...definately for a millennial crowd. I ended up building my own taco with a few too many ingredients so it was difficult to consume without a knife and fork, but yummy nonetheless. The service was really slow the night we went. Apparently, they were switching over their computer system so it took forever to get our drinks which were served in small mason jars....i do like my wine in a wine glass!"}
{"text":"So We came here on a Friday for lunch.....as you know it's a hipster bar hang out.  Take that for what you will were not Hipsters . I don't judge people that's my MO and always appreciate the same in return!!   We belly-Up'ed at the bar as usual....Andrea was our bartender/server.  She handles the room like a  Boss taking care of everyone. Our group hit it off like a 10yr reunion with the chick you never had a convo with in Highschool but always wanted too . Totally awesome. We all laughed Sooo hard throughout the banter that everyone left feeling like a dis-function-able family.   And that's what's keep me coming back, Not the bad ass tacos or the delicious Melted cheese (couldnt spell Casso right)  Whatever....it's the bad ass service that Andrea provides each and every time.....You want great service and better Banter check out Bario Tremont on Fridays."}

{"text":"Passion fruit mimosa is amazing. Chips and salsa are on point. Brunch tacos are awesome - good solid food and the atmosphere is awesome. We loved sitting by the fire!! Kathryn was our server and she was SO sweet. She heard my fiancé and I were getting married this fall and before we left she came back and wished is a very heartfelt wedding/life together. We had an amazing experience here and will be back next time we visit!"}
{"text":"Some of the best chips and guac I have ever had! Went the build your own taco route that was suggested by the waiter. Hard corn tortillas and they put so much meat in the tacos. Cannot wait to get back to Cleveland to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Seriously not a fan. Been here many many times trying to give it the benefit of the doubt because of friends but this is one of the most overrated places ever. The whole \"order your taco\" like chipotle thing aside the service is at best mediocre. The number of times it takes, without, exaggeration 10 minutes to get approached to even order a drink (and they are always out of half of the selections) is ridiculous. Good thing they are open late and serve alcohol.   This is not a Mexican restaurant. It's a hipster chipotle with a full liquor license."}
{"text":"Never had the chance to eat there, went on a busy night after a show. I Asked if the patio was fcfs, nope. I said ok and put my name in. A group came in way after us, and just sat down at a patio table. Table wasn't even bussed yet. Server said, you have to put your name in. They lied and said they did, which they didn't because I was standing there a half hour before they got there and could hear them working it. I went in to complain,  server knew what was up and told me she got the manager. Then I saw one of the group tip the hostess. I walked up to the hostess and asked if they were really going to let that happen. She said it was her mistake and yes. I said take my name off the list, I don't appreciate  being treated that way. They just lied to you and tipped you to shut you up. Not worth staying...."}
{"text":"Love it here.  I go once a week and my taco is fabulous every time.  Pick your own toppings so it's everything you like!  Super cheap, and get the queso to start.  Good for a quicker dinner and for big groups."}
{"text":"Although there have been times I did not like what I ordered, it was really my own fault.  You pick all of the toppings and sauces for each of your tacos yourself so if you aren't good at that sort of thing, you may want to reconsider.  I had wished that there was a suggestion page to guide you!  Our server was really nice and pretty attentive and the margaritas weren't bad either.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the guacamole was amazing! I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Barrio.  I was randomly in Cleveland to make a craigslist purchase (okay, I lived to tell about it and it was a fixed gear bicycle, so you get where this is going/why I was at Barrio), so we stopped here.  I was instantly blown away at how good this place is.  It was absolute pandemonium in the restaurant when the lovely host took my order for takeout without batting an eyelash at the ensuing chaos surrounding us.  Between the service, price, quality of food, and ambience, this place is 10/10 goodness.  We even made a second trip up a few weeks later --  me on a Friday night at 730pm: \"we could do Cleveland tonight?\" g/f: \"Barrio is worth the 150 mile drive - let's go.\"  Ended up going twice that weekend -- it's that good.  Super dope to let us keep our dog, Ollie, on the patio on a packed Friday night, too, who managed not to piss on anything for an hour -- a new record for him.  He's down with Barrio.  Lifelong customer, for sure.  The stoner taco is a must, and the breakfast tacos were especially delicious (breakfast tacos normally gravitating from shitty to underwhelming and overrated, Barrio being the exception to the rule), but realistically, you can't go wrong -- anything and  everything on the menu is A+."}
{"text":"Probably among my favorite mexi style places in the Cleveland area.  It's always fun to design my own meals and the prices aren't bad.  One star off because it gets pretty crowded and wrecked/messy.  Keep up with the cleaning and I'll up it to 5 stars."}
{"text":"The tacos here make you feel like Kazaam made it start raining candy bars!! Sooo good! Respectable beer selection too.  Just keep walking past City Tap ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome place! From start to finish its the best. Chips and salsa are great, and it's so much fun picking out your favorite taco toppings. The margaritas and sangria are delish. This place is great."}
{"text":"I went with 3 other friends on Sunday evening around 6:30.  We sat in the second side room and it filled up fast.  I like the fact that you can pick and choose exactly how you want your taco made with fillings/toppings etc... We ordered the basic house guacamole and it was really good and so was the chips and salsa you get when you sit down. All the tacos we ordered were tasty and we were really pleased with them.  The vibe was casual and relaxed and the service was good.  The only drawbacks that I thought worth mentioning is that it was very hot in the room we were in, we ate, had margaritas and left because we wanted to go outside for some fresh air.  Also the margaritas are good but a tad pricey for a basic pitcher.  The price goes up as you get the higher end tequilas as well.  Overall all the food was really good and I'd like to try their Tremont location as well sometime soon."}
{"text":"Went during lunch time on a Saturday.  They were busy, but we were sat right away.  Our drink orders and chips and salsa arrived in a timely manner as well as the queso dip.  Then it took over 30 minutes for 3 tacos and a bread pudding.  The server told us twice that our tacos would be right out.   When the tacos finally came they were somewhat warm and not worth the price, although the Chimi Steak was quite tasty.  I would have liked an apology from the server for the long wait, but did not get one. Then we waited another 20 minutes to get the bill.  We had to ask another server for our bill since our server was too busy to check on us. We were there over an hour which is just too long for a few tacos (we did not order dessert). First and last visit."}
{"text":"I had Barrio food truck at a graduation party on Saturday and I got food poisoning. At least 40 others did as well."}
{"text":"I really can't do it anymore. I just can't. It's just mind blowing how every-single-visit whatever I CLEARLY mark on the menu doesn't translate very well to BOH.   I order twice, 2 tacos each time. First time was one steak taco and one chicken taco. Instead of chicken, I got the pork. Which actually was very good. I'm beyond giving passes to the server or the kitchen because it is a problem every-single-time. So second time I order 2 CHICKEN tacos. And I get 2 PORK TACOS again!!!  Another time I ordered a stoner with pork, a soft with beef, and 2 softs with chicken...all the same condiments. What do I get? Stoner with beef, one pork, one chicken, and another beef. Seriously?   How the FUCK that doesn't seem to mesh with a simple system of reading once, double, and triple checking for order accuracy by the kitchen is way beyond me. I don't give a shit if its busy anywhere in Barrio. There is simply no reason why ANY order can't be done properly. The other major issue is the service. Not only do your orders either get put in wrong, or made wrong and not checked, politely pointing out a discrepancy to your service is the biggest inconvenience for them and is bound to make them unreasonably shitty towards you. Like when you clearly say you want separate checks when asked how the bill should be, receive one, kindly remind them it was separate, and then have the ticket ripped out of your hands and returned slammed down on the table. Un-fucking-real.  Don't even waste the time and energy trying to come here, more often than not it is just not worth it. Should you bother to actually go, I strongly advise you check your stuff before whoever leaves, and for fucks sake say something and make them fix the dumb mistake. Trust me, it REALLY gets old."}
{"text":"Barrio is my favorite casual restaurant downtown. I've been there countless times and I always leave stuffed and satisfied.  The guac and queso with your chips are a must. While cheap, the tacos are very filling and have great flavor. I always recommend newcomers order 2-3 tacos.  The green goddess shell is awesome. I usually pair it with pulled pork, pineapple salsa, cheese, and lettuce. While on the plainer side, it still has a lot of flavor.  The margaritas are sweet and addicting. The peach marg with a sugar rim is my go-to. Can't go wrong with any flavor.  Good selection of beer on tap. (Not my forte, so not a lot to say here)  Anyone new to Cleveland should definitely check out Barrio!"}
{"text":"Went to enjoy a sunny patio experience in tremont and having eaten at Barrio before but never having been on patio we were excited to try it. The server, Hope, was bubbly and fun and made us want to stay longer. The patio is gorgeous views in almost every direction.  Hope made some great suggestions for food and we ordered more than we normally woul DC because her recommendations were so scrumptious sounding. We tried the tofu, Mahi Mahi (pescado design dia) complete vegetarian concoctions and shredded pulled pork. We thought the pulled pork screamed to be in a tamale but the crunch wrap was incredible. The tofu was delicious and the veggie concoctions were very good. The star was the Mahi in a crunch wrap with Hope's recommended pineapple salsa we added mango salsa and it just sang we will be ordering that again. The mojito concoction made from taquilla was so good it was followed with a few more. The only miss was the traditional guacamole but Hope accommodated our tastes by bringing some fresh Pico de Gallo that we mixed in and it came to life. We will definitely be back and hope Hope is working when we return with friends. Great food incredible patio in tremont and wonderful staff. Perfect experience thank you.  I highly recommend this place to everyone, if you can't tell, we really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, and great drinks and food.  The corn queso is wonderful. The tacos were excellent, fresh ingredients with just enough heat. Will be back."}
{"text":"So I stopped by Barrio in Lakewood after a night of celebrating for a food nightcap. I have frequented the location in Tremont so I knew what I was in for......an anemic taco, skimpy on the filling and lukewarm at best, enjoyed in a drunken haze, doused in the hottest sauce just to see if I could do it.  I don't know what they are doing in this location, but Barrio Tremont should take note....the tacos here were AMAZING!!!! I got two tacos....the filling overflowing from their shells. Meat was hot, flavorful and generous. All the ingredients I selected were visible in the taco and the presented like a cornucopia spilling its bounty. AWESOME!!! Service was great too, but kudos to the kitchen...keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I still like the tacos and the margaritas, but don't care for the new patio.  The outside area use to have some character and now it looks and feels like a mall food  court."}
{"text":"Why does this place exist? Food is uniformly bland, chips always stale, drinks taste like Mountain Dew, decor is pointlessly dumb, clientele makes skin crawl. Best part - happy hour only applies at the bar. On a stool. Nowhere else. Fuck you."}
{"text":"Great food, every time! I love their pre-created Taco selections and love that they give you the opportunity to create your own. The chips and multiple dip selections are amazing. The margaritas are incredible and there's no way to stop at one!"}
{"text":"Seriously, go out of your way to drive the extra miles and skip the Lakewood location. After over a dozen visits, I have yet to have a problem with the original Barrio location, unlike Lakewood. I mostly go for happy hour for the value, BUT, if I can't make happy hour and want my Barrio taco fix by paying full price then I get my money's worth here and am glad to do so. Orders, while pretty simple have always been on point and taste great. They got their shit on lockdown here!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place in Cleveland, hands down. You must have the \"stoner\" taco (soft shell/hard shell with queso and chorizo layered in, then stuffed) - El Jefe is my personal fav! Date and Bacon guac should be a full time thing in my opinion, but catch their rotating fun twists on guacamole. Never had a bad one, try the creative specials - they rock!  Margs are amazing and the happy hour specials are a good deal to catch.  Side note: Nachos from Barrio at the ballpark are also completely amazing and worth every calorie too!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials, amazing service, friendly all around, constant attention from multiple servers, chatty bartenders, and AMAZING tacos! And they are only 3 dollars each! Thai chili tofu is my boyfriend. Xoxoxoxoxoxxoxoxo"}
{"text":"I am mostly vegan and have tried this place Three times!!!!! All three times I have done build your own taco  with NO meat and all three  times my tacos have had MEAT on them ! WTF!!!'  just saying I was there  on Monday and then again on  Wednesday.... major fail!"}
{"text":"Good place with decently priced alcohol. Tacos are fun but they can do better in taste."}
{"text":"$3 tacos.  Good atmosphere, and really good tacos.  This is a cool place."}
{"text":"Quality food and fully customizable. Always busy but the staff works together to provide good service. Margaritas are fantastic and they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"We came here on Saturday. The food was pretty good, guac was great. The only disappointment was that the corn tortillas are fried, crunchy tortillas. Not soft, warm corn tortillas like they really use in Mexico. Will try the flour tortillas next time we're there. The margaritas were pretty good!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute FAVORITE restaurant!  I love how the tacos are completely customizable, it has totally spoiled me for other Mexican places.  Once you find the right combination, you will love it.  It took me about 3 visits to get it perfect, and now, no other taco compares.  The queso elote (with sweet corn) is amazing as well.  And the traditional guacamole is smooth and not too spicy.  Also, everything on the menu goes perfect with a jalapeno margarita!  Sounds weird, but try it!  You won't go back to fruity margs ever again!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last Friday.  The wait was not bad and food was great.   A good experience.  If you like tacos this is good place."}
{"text":"IF YOU ARE BLACK I wouldn't go here. I was totally mistreated from everyone in the place except for Paris the manager. She helped out the best she could but the entire staff was rude and racist in my opinion. I came in from Atlanta, Ga to visit family and they chose this place to go to and it was horrible service but the food was good. Margaritas were too sweet but other than that I will NEVER go back again."}
{"text":"Really impressed with Barrio. This was my first time there. Sat at the bar and was taken care of by a great team - Dez, Jenn and another very nice young blonde woman whose name I don't recall. I went in for a quick dinner and ended up sticking around for 3+ hours.  I went dealer's choice on the tacos and was not dissapointed. At $4/ea I thought it was a great value. These aren't skimpy Taco Bell tacos - I had 3 and it filled me up.  Awesome tap list. I am a big IPA drinker and there were a few really nice double IPAs, which was impressive. Very different from other 4th Street establishments claiming to have a great beer selection.  My coworker had the Barrio food truck at his wedding and gave the restaurant very high remarks. My high expectations were absolutely exceeded.  I will be back every time I am in Cleveland. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"If you haven't eaten at Barrio, you have been missing out on an opportunity to thank the Lord for His kindness to mankind. Customizable tacos and specialty queso (along with complementary Chips & Salsa), along with a kitchen that's open late have led to many delicious date nights over the past several months. The Service is fantastic as well, with friendly and knowledgable servers and kitchen staff! Stop in as quickly as you can (be prepared though as it's not exactly a secret anymore, so there's sometimes a wait...) and enjoy some fantastic tacos!"}
{"text":"We were super excited about this place opening, as we have been frequent patrons of the Tremont location. I'm sad to write such a negative review but we have been here MANY times to give it a fair chance. The bartenders (really, several of them, during several different visits) are unbelievably rude!!!! I have never in my life experienced such consistently terrible service; it almost seems like it must part of their training: being an asshole. And I don't mean just inattentive (though they are that, as well) but profoundly rude to customers. Just to clarify though, the wait staff- after we have been seated- have always been good. No complaints there.  One other thing that this Barrio is incredibly consistent with is getting orders wrong. Every time. Seriously. EVERY TIME. It almost makes you wish that you could write down exactly what you want on your taco and give them a piece of paper with the information on it so they could check.....oooohhh...waaaaiiit......."}
{"text":"Loving the Curd Ferguson! El Jefe is also very tasty.  Great place for tacos and margaritas - cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great tacos and great cheese dip. I wasn't too thrilled when I first went but once I found my taco I fell in love with the place. It's my go to place when I want some good cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Great build your own tacos...sauces are also great!!!!!!..plenty of different combos to make!!!!...something for everyone And tasty Margheritas. Happy Hour is the best bang for your buck"}
{"text":"I went in with high expectations after hearing great things and was not disappointed. As busy as it was on a Saturday night, they offered us a table by the bar to seat us as quickly as possible. Our waiter was attentive and made sure we were happy even though it was clear he was super busy and had many people to take care of. Overall a fun place (bubble in taco orders!), great (and cheap!) food and drinks, and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"The taco ingredients are fresh and high quality, with endless combination possibilities. Our bartender Lauren and her co-workers behind the bar were attentive and efficient, even during a busy weekend night. She makes an excellent Manhattan! Our server was friendly and also very attentive. We'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Spend just a few minutes at Barrio and you'll recognize why this Mexican Restaurant is different. It begins with the chef's respect for the ingredients and passion for excellence in the kitchen. That care, value, and enthusiasm translate to deliciousness on the plate. Every morning the staff prepares the staples for the day: salsa, pico de gallo, sauces, guacamole. Nothing comes from a can or from the freezer.  Real Mexican food, the kind my parents and grandparents prepared, is really healthy. At Barrio, everything is made fresh and every Taco is individually cooked to order. It may take a little longer, but you'll find it's worth the wait.  This place is very good."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for late night tacos and drinks. We indicated to the hostess , whose presence seemed unnecessary given the late hour, that we would go to the bar and sat down at a table in the bar area. She followed us over there to sass us condescendingly and inform us \"excuse you. I am the hostess and I am in charge of seating the tables, I'm sorry if that's confusing for you to understand.\"   I COULD  understand if the place was busy and we had bumped others waiting for a table but they weren't busy at all. It's pretty normal for tables in a bar area to be open to seat yourself. And it could have been handled in a way that didn't leave us feeling like we had pissed on a rug by some hostess on a power trip. Her one job is to be cordial and friendly. We were so off put by her attitude that we left.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"3 bartenders in a empty bar talking to each other,10 mins to order a beer and never coming back to check for another round. Thank god u fill the food order by ur self. Add another 10 to close the tab.Must try to belive it!!"}
{"text":"Definitely returning, was my first time at the Tremont location. We had Cano (very unique, cool name, and i only know how to spell cause of our reciept). But he was very knowledgeable about the menu, taught us how to order.  Referred some good cocktails.  We had a marigold and an el diablo which were amazing like he said theyd be. While he was cleaning off the table next to us, he must of seen my daughter spill salsa (which is delicious) on yourself and he immediately stopped what he was doing searched for a clean towel and brought a cup of soda water and helped clean off her shirt. Now thats above and beyond service.  I didnt even see it happen lol. We will definitely be back to this location, it instantly became our fav out of the three and he instantly became our favorite server. You guys should let him bartend because while we waited for our table we got a drink and the guys at the bar were not pretty happy. Cano made us feel very comfortable and it felt right at home. He definitely set the bar and since then weve been to other restaurants and we always say, wish the server was more like Cano. 5 stars for food and service. Your coca cola steak is phenominal by the way. And so is the chorizo queso!"}
{"text":"Drinks are like water....did not enjoy....food was very well...i mean very well.....customer service was like shyt....ordered a pitcher of margarita"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. I went with my boyfriend to barrio because it was highly recommended to us by a few people. The server was pretty inattentive and didn't seem to eager to get our order in. The food was good, but despite being able to check off exactly what we wanted they left some things off. Also I ordered the mushrooms for my \"meat\" and there were barely any in my bowl. To be honest it was mostly lettuce.   Despite all that the atmosphere is very cool and for the price I guess you get what you get. I probably will go back because I love the tremont area and it's a cheap place in a trendy and usually expensive area. I still want to be impressed by barrio so hopefully my next experience is better! From reading others reviews it seems like it's hit or miss."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and the tacos are amazing. They have one of the best chips and salsa around. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well. My party and I were a little confused at first on how to build the taco but the server I had (carly was her name) made it very simple for us and was a great help."}
{"text":"Terrible service - ordered carryout - showed up on time and was provided bill, which I promptly paid. The bartender \"checked\" on the order and told me it would be 5 more minutes. She then \"checked\" on it twice more over 20 minutes before telling me they had lost my order. Unclear when in the process they lost it, but curious what she was actually checking on. Had them cancel my check so I could take my business elsewhere. Can't recommend based on my experience."}
{"text":"I used to love Barrio, but lately I've had some horrible experiences and I will now be going to the Barrio in Tremont instead of the one on Madison in Lakewood.  The food is always excellent, besides the occasional mishap when they're super busy. Overall, very good quality and awesome portions.  My first bad experience here happened a few months ago. I went with my best friend from out of town. We each got one taco during happy hour and the total was less than 5 bucks. However, when the server (Audrey, idk if she still works there) came back to the bar to hand me my debit card she informed me that she accidentally ran my card with the bill for the table behind us. Their bill was $24. I knew I was going to be overdrawn and wasn't exactly sure if my card would be accepted (I was waiting for a check to clear and only had $20 in that account.) Anyways, she apologized a few times, but didn't really seem to care or realize how big of a mistake she had just made. She informed me the money would be refunded onto the card in a few days. Before leaving, I asked for both receipts. She had thrown them in the trash and had to dig them out for me.  A few days passed, no refund. A week passed and no refund. I began calling the restaurant every day, speaking with multiple servers and managers, but I was not receiving any luck. Instead, everyone seemed annoyed by my calls and were not concerned about their server swiping the wrong card for a bill. Over a month had went by and my sister and I decided to go inside to talk to someone in person. And also to get some tacos, because hey, tacos. Matt was very nice and helpful, asked me to write down my number and said a manager would call me once the situation was figured out. Nobody ever called me. I called them and I was told I had given them the wrong number, even though I wrote the number down myself...after a big list of excuses, a Manger I never spoke to before finally took the time to figure out why I was charged over 20 bucks for a bill that was no more than 5 dollars. He said there were no records of either bill at all. Which indicates the server completely erased all of the evidence. Luckily, I had both of the receipts. FINALLY, my account was refunded a week later.  A week after this my sister and I decided to once again eat here. Everything was great, service, food, etc. THEN, as the server is handing me the bill she holds it up to me and rudely says, \"Is this okay? The total? I just need to make sure this is okay before I run YOUR card.\" Um, excuse me? We knew this was due to the prior incident and we will not be returning to this specific location."}
{"text":"Taco paradise! If you are in Cleveland and you need tacos, this needs to be your one and only stop! Very cool place too with enthusiastic staff!"}
{"text":"The food here is simply to die for.  Fresh ingredients, great price, and a wonderful bar.  Excellent ambiance and a superb location right in the heart of Gateway next to E. 4th, Progressive Field, and The Q.  A must visit when in Downtown Cleveland, especially at night."}
{"text":"As Barrio becomes more popular they care less about customer service. A group of us went in late and ordered tacos and drinks. At 1:15 our mostly full drinks were taken out of our hands rudely-by a woman who was not our waitress- and we were told their liquor license ends at one. We asked if we could quickly finish the drinks we payed for since we weren't alerted about this before and promptly told no. We were treated like we should have known yet we were allowed to stay and finish our tacos. When I told me waitress about what had happened she just said she didn't know the license ended at that time. Their staff seems untrained and unconcerned about their customers experience. We won't be returning to Barrio to waste our money again and treated poorly."}
{"text":"Excellent food, even better service. Everyone knows their food is excellent, but the service at the Cleveland heights location is awesome. They do a great job, and will be back many many times"}
{"text":"Have never once had good service here. Even if its a slower night I've watched customers come in after me, get served, and eating before my order is taken. However, the food is amazing and i go back."}
{"text":"Its a lil expensive, but worth it. We did the crest your own tacos, they were amazing.  And they're white queso dip and chips was amazing too. Hubby put it on his tacos too, lol. Oh and great margaritas.  Definitely going back whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and always want to like it so much more. The margaritas are awesome! Unfortunately 4 out of 5 times my tacos have been really soggy :( with room temp fillings."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland and it was recommended. We were seated quickly but then no one came to take drink order and after 20 minutes we just got up and left after having no one coming to get the food and drink coming.  It was disappointing because they were not even busy busy yet."}
{"text":"This place is ok at the absolute best, known for tacos, really? I don't think these people have been down south or ever been to South of the Border... because then  they would know what tacos are supposed to be like, and more importantly what they taste like. I gave this place a couple of chances but every time I've been there I've been disappointed,  I guess the $2 Taco is good desl but even that seems like a waste a couple of times that I give these guys a shot, I guess I've been spoiled having been down in Texas, Louisiana and Cali; the south in general where the do tacos well and with a ton of flavor ! The service staff tries but I guess if the product isn't that great... the team can only so much! My suggestion is to keep it simple keeping original and don't try and do too too much to the tacos, there's supposed to be enjoyed plain and simple but with lot of flavor and some cilantro and some lime !"}
{"text":"GREAT.  Make your own tacos and fantastic margaritas - what's not to like? Ask for Jae at this location."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night based on all the rave reviews I've heard from other people. It was average at best. The taco selection and create your own is nice, but the queso, guac, and margaritas were all rather bland and  boring. Service was not great either. Our server was very rushed and didn't take any time to explain how it works or go over any specials or recommendations. Ok if you want an inexpensive meal downtown, but go in with low expectations."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations of Barrio (Tremont and this one) and have left extremely satisfied.    First - Barrio is not meant to be an \"authentic\" mexican restaurant.  It's more of a modern day american mexican fusion - and it does not disappoint.  Next - All of the ingredients are fresh.  I've not had the salsa roja (what they bring to your table with chips) taste the same on two visits, EVER.  The taste of cilantro is strong and fresh and the heat is juuuuust right.  The tofu is the best I've ever had and their salsas and sauces (hint no. 1 that this is not \"authentic:\" salsa means sauce in spanish) are delicious.  Tortillas are never going to hold up to tons of sauce, so if tortilla strength is what matters to you, get a green goddess or a stoner OR get less sauces.  Don't forget that the tacos are YOUR creation.    One More Thing - The staff is great.  I've only had one server who was less than attentive to my table...but it was a Friday night and it's a divey taco place with an AMAZING bar.  I have to plan to get a margarita, every time.  I just created this Yelp account because of Jae at this location.  Very friendly, knowledgable, and attentive.    I've not had a bad experience at either location of Barrio.  It comes highly recommended by myself and all of my friends!  One of my girlfriends just declared it our go-to \"date\" location.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came to Barrio for their Stone Brewing tap takeover during Cleveland Beer Week. My girlfriend and I specifically came for happy hour as an employee posted on Facebook that the featured beers would be included in happy hour pricing ($1 off). The beer was on the expensive side, even for some of the rarer stuff they were selling, so when I saw that I was charged full price for both, I had to check to see if a mistake was made. I was told by... someone (? Maybe a manager? He was sitting and having a beer at the bar) that they could not afford to take a dollar off for the Stone beers. I understand that, the beer was probably not cheap to obtain, but don't advertise it on the internet if you can't do it. I really felt stupid, like I showed up under false pretense.  Anyway, the beer was very good, though they serve all craft beer in 16 oz mason jars, which is weird. Not only is it bad for the high quality beer to be served like that, but I really don't understand how it fits into the whole Mexican food theme.  Overall, thumbs down Barrio."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and decided to give Barrio a try with a few friends and couldn't have been more happy with my experience! The tacos are very affordable $3-$5 depending upon what you put on them. I opted to get 2 tacos, the stoner taco and the green goddess, from the other reviews with varying add ons and rice and beans on the side. They were both delicious and filling, I can normally eat 3-4 tacos at your regular mom & pop Mexican joint and I left stuffed after only 2. The decor on the inside is pretty eccentric and different but I liked it because it presented a more relaxed atmosphere. Our server was really nice, friendly, and knew the menu and favorites well, so he was able to lead us in the right direction on how to order or what we might want.  We got there at about 7 and it was pretty crowded. I agree with some of the other reviews in that there is not much room to wait for a table but we managed to find a spot by the bar to stand where we weren't in the way too much. I'd recommend getting there before 7 if possible. The only downside I found was that the drinks were slightly expensive $4-$4.50 for a beer and $5-$9 for a margarita, but for the price and quality of the tacos and service it's well worth it. If I lived in the area, I'd for sure go back!"}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious.  You can build your own or pick some from the menu.  They are $3 and $4-5 with some of the add ons, but so good."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because I've heard so many good things. But honestly the two tacos I had were not that good. By no means was it disgusting, I just wouldn't order them again. I like the idea of building your own taco in theory, but when you don't know how the sauces, salsas, and meats are flavored, its hard to pair them on your own. The premade choices were also mostly listed as spicy. I know people like spicy and that's fine, but I don't, and the one or two non spicy options were not that appealing.   We also sat inside because we didn't want to wait for an outdoor table, and I regretted that. It was way too dark inside. I'm not a vampire. The extra wait for a patio table would have been worth it.  I didn't hate it, but wouldn't choose to go back unless a friend really wanted to go there."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed is that the atmosphere is great! Fun decor and a fun crowd. Secondly though, service at the Lakewood location is questionable. I found the working hostess to be notably rude. Buck up, buttercup.   The tacos are just strange. I had high hopes for great tacos with unique flavors, but the meat was cold, the toppings that should have been cold were warm, and they were all-in-all kind of soggy. I gave it two chances, and both times found some of mine to be almost inedible, even when I tried suggested combinations.    The queso, though? Oh lord, keep it comin'. Notably, the corn queso. Heart be still.  This is the perfect place for drinks and chips with a group!   Cool concept, but meh tacos. Go here for the queso. Such queso. Wow."}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times and it has been great each time.  Especially the bartender Sarah she was awesome and probably one of the most professional bartenders I've ever dealt with."}
{"text":"Tacos are so flavorful, reasonably priced, and nicely sized.   If you like spicy things, try their El Chupacabra. Spiciest drink I've had, ever. Burns so good."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and my friends took me to Barrio for brunch on Saturday. It seems like the place fills up pretty quickly but we got there shortly after they opened and had no problem getting a table. Loved the decor! I wish I had a chandelier full of liquor bottles.  My group of 4 split a pitcher of the blood orange margarita to start. I'm not usually a morning drinker but it really hit the spot! I also like how you get to fill out your own food menus and the server just picks all of them up and takes them to the kitchen. I got the biscuits and gravy and a spicy Sapanaro taco. Both were really good! I was a little disappointed the taco wasn't spicier but maybe my taste buds are shot.  Very cool place! Good atmosphere, good service and good food. That's all you can ask for really."}
{"text":"Yaaay I must say that the tacos here are yummy. This is my second time coming here and I enjoy the selection they have for the vegan peeps. I was able to create my own taco with an array of items to choose from and I must say my special little combo was delish! Only problem I have is the tacos don't make it very far, they get soggy really quick."}
{"text":"Went to GRONAN's Taco world with my GIRLfriend (she's a catch) and really enjoyed. Try this before you    die"}
{"text":"Seriously love Barrio. There are just so many endless possibilities when you eat here. Good margs, chips, salsa, queso, TACOS ... you name it, it's delicious. I just love how you can customize your order, so you never get the same thing twice (which can sometimes be bad if you like something and then don't remember what it is when you come back). A Cleveland staple."}
{"text":"I went for lunch a couple weeks ago with husband, sister, and baby.  One negative that I never would have noticed a few months ago, before I was pushing a stroller everywhere, is that this place is not accessible.  We had to lift the stroller up some steps to get onto the patio.  Doable for us, but maybe not for everyone.  And according to a previous review, it seems like it's a good thing we brought the stroller because they don't have anything to accomodate a baby.  I had a standard margarita (good, but not noteworthy), and we got guac (same) to start.  My sister had been here before and already knew what she liked on her tacos.  My husband tried some of the breakfast tacos, which he liked.  I made up my own.  I don't remember exactly what I got, but one of them had the tofu and pineapple salsa and a bunch of other stuff (very similar to one of the suggested tacos), and it was awesome!  The other had chorizo, which I disliked enough to not eat (which is saying something).  I gave it to my husband (a true sausage lover) and he also did not like it.  It was a bit greasy, but the real problem was the flavor.  They must use some seasoning that I can't place.  My husband said the sausage used in the breakfast tacos was different and very good, so keep an eye out for that!  I enjoy the format of designing my own tacos, and wouldn't mind eating here again, but I am satisfied with having tried it once and don't see a need to go back."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the place. The food is okay, and priced relatively well. I thought the ordering format was good. But the margaritas are definitely below average. I had much higher expectations of them.   A tip: if you're hungry, go with the soft taco as they contain a *lot* more than the hard shell versions.   They do have a decent selection of gluten-free ingredients, and do an admirable job of calling out GF items."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Barrio for the first time Sunday night. it was not a terribly busy night, but there were still plenty of people there. We were impressed with the food. We both ordered a variety of tacos and everything was excellent. The food came out fast and piping hot and everything was fresh and delicious. Our server was Sarah and she rocked. She was friendly, attentive and cool. We ended up chatting a bit at the end of our dinner. The ambiance and music were. cool too. We dug the vibe.  We will definitely be there again."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by the tacos here, I prefer authentic Mexican tacos but am always open to try new kinds...of the 5 tacos we ordered two were okay and three were pretty gross - a very americanized version of tacos I guess - also they were quite large for tacos. The marg's were okay, the chips and guac also just okay. Overall, I wasn't too excited and probably won't bother going back on my next visit."}
{"text":"Great place for tacos. Service is usually fast and friendly. Definitely recommend going for happy hour. Who can beat $2 tacos?"}
{"text":"The first time we came, the food was OUT OF THIS WORLD. The second time (only a week later -- we were hooked!), it was just okay. I couldn't really believe the difference in how the tacos tasted and I pretty much ordered the same thing. Either the toppings were really cold when put on or it had been sitting out for awhile, but they were pretty unsavory. Chips and salsa is among the best I've had. Like the environment and they dealt with my kids. So...4 stars for now."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch date last weekend. I mean, tacos, that you choose yourself -- what could be bad? Nothing was bad really, but the service could have been more consistent. Overly in your face for a half hour and then unable to be flagged down for the next half hour. Chips and salsa were great. Guacamole was tasty but tasted slightly like the stuff you get at Costco as opposed to the fresh, made-at-your-table concoctions I have grown to love. Margs tasted okay but not strong, so order a pitcher if you're looking for a buzz."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I was in Cleveland on business in March of this year and ate at Barrio three times during my short trip! We got into town late on our first night and there wasn't much open at that time, so we decided to give this place a try. Love the build your own tacos menu. So many awesome choices for meat/veggies and any topping you could think of, along with choices for different styles of tortilla. Good chips and salsa, good service, and GREAT margaritas. Love the decor too. Overall an awesome place."}
{"text":"The food, while not traditional Mexican, is creative and excellent. Some growing pains when this location opened, but that's normal. I think the ordering system is unnecessarily awkward, but kind of fun once you get used to it. Probably helps minimize confusion in placing your order when the music is too loud to hear normal speech ;-)"}
{"text":"Had Barrio out of one of their mobile trucks a while back and just recently I went into the prospect location. I was aware that they were popular and that the wait would be a while so I can't even speak negatively about it. Once we were seated we're given a traditional menu and order cards are on the table. Having order cards is an amazing idea because of how loud the location is, which isn't a bad thing. It adds to the great atmosphere seeing as to how they have a full service bar with a few TVs running. You can either build your own tacos, or you can have the special menu tacos. In either situation you can't go wrong. And their queso blanco with chorizo is to die for."}
{"text":"Tacos were good, at $3.00 a piece can't beat it.But where did we go wrong, 10 min wait, seated 4 of us at 12:53, waited on server,chips,food&refills, waited for bill, strolled out 2:28!Between us we had 6 tacos=$18.00, 3 margaritas one ice tea w/refill add $40.00 to the bill nice expensive lunch 58.50 +tip we left with a hefty bill. Service was terrible!High priced margaritas No alcohol taste more like flavored water! Eat tacos drink water, their food truck is better option, I'll give 1 more try"}
{"text":"Finally a Barrio with more seating! I'm glad they put this downtown location in. The food is the same great, fully customizable tacos. The chips are salsa make for great appetizers. Happy hour has nice deals."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of the barrios taco truck catering one of our wedding events this past summer. The tacos we got were all delicious - sweet potato, roasted veggies, chicken.   The guys in the truck were so pleasant and responsive. All of our guests were thrilled with the food.   Recommend these guys heartily."}
{"text":"There is always a great debate among friends and locals as to which place serves the best tacos.  Well the debate ends here...Barrio is the top of the taco food chain.  The idea of basically constructing every taco to your exact liking is a great concept and part of the draw to this place.  You want Coca-Cola braised steak tacos...check, you want Salsa Verde...check, want veggies only or gluten-free...check.  You get the idea.  I always make the mistake of ordering three tacos, while plowing through chips and quac only to discover that 3rd taco is going home to serve as a great late night snack.  I always go to this location, because the waits seem shorter and the servers are all pretty great.  The other great thing about Barrio, is their large and ever-evolving stable of beers.  No matter your particular tastes, they will have something you like.  Cleveland has taco places popping up everywhere, but Barrio is still king,"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Simply outstanding.   Came in about 5:45 on a Saturday night. Place was packed. Waited about 5 minutes and took a seat at the bar.   We started with a salsa of some sort and a guac with blue cheese and bacon. Unbelievable.   I had 2 tacos, daughter had 1. We chose to order off the menu rather than build our own. I have no idea what I got, but it was delish!  Daughter got some taco with tofu that was as good if not better than my meaty ones.    Not to be outdone, we both had Margarettas. Mine was traditional top shelf, daughter had strawberry on the rocks. Both rocked my world.   For desert, I had a glass on Blantons on the rocks. I would come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Cleveland hands down. Great atmosphere, outdoor patio, and beers on tap. Always high quality at a pretty decent price."}
{"text":"I love Barrio. The tacos are really delicious. The only downside is how greasy they are. It's like they're made of 90% water but it doesn't really affect the taste of the taco in my opinion. The customer service was fantastic. We didn't need for a thing because there was always someone there. Always a crowded place to eat, though but we didn't have to wait for a table or anything. The drinks were good - really strong, though but that's how I like them. I could drink the prickle pear margarita all day like it's kool-aid, it's that good."}
{"text":"Last night busted barrio with nine others and was happy to be greeted by the staff who worked well together to make sure we never ran out of chips. Our server was patient and well organized for a large group. Tacos were amazing our server even check with us to make sure we knew how many we were ordering since it gets a little tricky with the number you fill in for special tacos. The Queso was one of the tables favorite. Some of the tables first time so it was great to have such a great experience."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! My favorite casual restaurant downtown, food is GREAT. Ordered delivery before too. Food was made correctly and ON TIME. They may want to invest in more bartenders on the weekend though. White Widow is my favorite taco! Also THEY DON'T GIVE YOU A BAG OF AIR when ordering chips to go! It's great!"}
{"text":"First things first, I absolutely will give this place another shot, but I was pretty disappointed by my first visit.  I went on a Tuesday with a group of friends who regularly visit local taco nights (Which we take very seriously.  There's even a blog).  I was very excited to check it out.  It was definitely very busy, and we were told it would be 20-30 minutes for a table.  We were okay with that since we had a larger group.  We eventually got some seats at the bar and grabbed some drinks.  They have a great happy hour, and I LOVED the margarita.  Plus, their draft beer selection is pretty impressive.  Service was pretty slow, but, again, they were very busy.  45 minutes later, we check on our table because we are noticing quite a few people leaving.  The hostess tells us that they are waiting on a group to leave and they will seat us.  At this point, we're pretty hungry and the bartender brings us chips & salsa, which we quickly devoured.  I could tell the bartender (who we learned was also the owner) could see is growing impatient.  They offer us a shot of tequila.  Yeah, alright.  Eventually, we learn the kitchen is completely overwhelmed and backed up and tacos are taking up to 45 minutes.  They are not seating anyone until they're back on track.  A friend goes to Edison's to get a slice of pizza then returns after eating.  Over an hour and a half after our arrival, we finally get a table.  Over and hour after we expected to get a table.  Our server, Patrick, was absolutely fantastic.  Super personable (and I think he was told about our group and made sure he took good care of us).  He warned us that drinks and tacos were taking a while. So, we order drinks and tacos.  Drinks take a while, but we had already consumed enough that it was okay for us.  I could see others getting frustrated.    Patrick comes over a little while and tells me awful news.  They were out of tofu.  I'm a vegetarian.  Not a problem, just make them with black beans.  Five minutes later, they are also out of black beans.  Ah hell.  We had already been there for two hours, and I was starving, and that's when I officially became frustrated.  How does a mexican place run out of black beans?!  We had already been there for two hours with no tacos.  It was 9:30 at this point.  They offer to buy our tacos.  I assumed it was just the tacos that were on my tab.  So, tacos come out, and everyone loves them.  They made mine with the fixings I had selected and rice.  The sauces are very good, and I liked the shells.  I was underwhelmed due to the lack of protein, but I was starving and would have eaten nearly anything at that point.    Ultimately, they actually bought the entire tables' tacos, which wasn't necessary, but it was a very nice gesture.  We thanked the bartender/owner before we left because I think he knew the night had been a bit of a disaster, especially for our group.  The place has a lot going for it. The atmosphere is great, the patio is fantastic, and the tacos and guacamole were great.  I think they need to work out the new restaurant kinks... Then I'll go back."}
{"text":"Checked out Barrio last weekend and the food is great!  Made our own tacos and all the ingredients were fresh and tacos were a perfect size.  We also had one of the guacamole's which was fabulous as well. They also give you free chips and salsa.  We did try going once on a Saturday night around 8 a few weeks back and there was a 9 table wait, so I recommend getting there early.  The wait staff is very \"hipster\" but I thought the service was good.  They are opening a location in Lakewood, which I'm afraid will tempt me to go more often since it's right in my neighborhood.  I would go all the time if it wasn't for trying to eat healthy most of the time!"}
{"text":"I've visited both the Tremont and Lakewood locations, having had great experiences at both. I usually try and get up there for happy hour (4-7) on Tuesdays when they offer half off margaritas and $1 off tacos. Be advised - get up there early because the place fills up fast!  Barrio offers complimentary chips and salsa to start you off while you look over the menu. You get a sheet of paper with options for the kind of shell, meat (or vegetarian subs), cheese, toppings, salsa, and sauce. I like having the choice to build each taco and think about what toppings would pair and taste delicious. Each time you go in you can switch it up and try something new. I tend to always go with the stoner shell (soft shell with a crunch, chorizo, and queso) and the green goddess (soft shell with a crunch, guac, and queso). I ordered chorizo and pulled pork tacos and switched up all the toppings. I really like their adobo creme sauce. Besides a pretty solid margarita, tequila, and whiskey selection - they offer a huge list of draft and bottled beer.   The decor at both locations is really modern and different. It has a sort of Mexican Day of the Dead theme going on, with large skeleton murals painted throughout the building. The Tremont location has an awesome skeleton riding a bicycle hanging from the ceiling in the bar room. The staff is always very quick, attentive, and friendly. Don't be afraid to ask them for suggestions!  Barrio is a Westside staple, and definitely a go-to for tacos! I highly recommend checking out both locations. You will never get bored with the menu!"}
{"text":"This place was only okay in my book.  The tacos were really good but I honestly wasn't blown away.  I think there were too many sauces on the tacos.  Our waitress was great though."}
{"text":"If you don't like your food here, you have nobody to blame but yourself. If you like spicy food, this place doesn't disappoint. Sit down, order a drink and fill out your order form. Choose your tortilla, meat, cheese, condiments, house made sauce and sides. I tried their chicken, corn tortilla, chipotle cream sauce, queso fresco cheese, corn, pico and I added sour cream and guac. I wouldn't be surprised if everything is organic here, great quality ingredients. Friendly staff and patrons and definitely not too uptight like some restaurants in the area can be. I really had a good time here. My margarita was bangin'. Five stars for what it is, a quick, affordable, taco place with a full bar. If you are a chipotle lover, you will agree that this place blows them out of the water, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We came for guacamole, tacos and margaritas. After leaving with a 50 dollar bill, we were disappointed.  Horrible service, old and mushy guacamole and practically nothing in our tacos (pictured).  The Fairmount (next door) has tacos and margs that are 10 times better."}
{"text":"Love Barrio, but this one is not Barrio at all. I've visited this one several times, very disappointing. The drinks tasted watery during happy hour. It takes forever for the bartender to take ours orders. Probably won't go back again. Location (for people who live at east Cleveland) is probably the only good thing I can say about this Barrio."}
{"text":"I came here once with some friends awhile ago for brunch and was kind of grossed out by the brunch tacos. In the end, we all left feeling horrible and spending the day concerned with bathroom trips.  I came back for some tacos one weekend recently and found that I just can't handle this place. The decor is cool, the build your own taco set up is unique, the staff is friendly, but I just...don't like it. Call me crazy, but Barrio is just not my favorite thing in Cleveland, especially for tacos. The chips and salsa are delicious, but even the drinks here aren't what I expect (pretty much every time I go to any Barrio). The real problem, though, is how tiny and loud this place gets. It's impossible to hear your own thoughts when the bar is packed. My husband and I ate our tacos and downed our drinks as quickly as possible because we could only stare at each other--no words because we wouldn't be able to hear each other anyways.  Overall, I think there's some value to Barrio, but it's just not my thing. Tremont has far better options and when parking is so difficult around here, I want my visit to be worth it."}
{"text":"This place is just OK--I think there's a huge difference between coming here for happy hour and wasting money and time otherwise. The happy hour deals--half off margaritas and $1 off tacos--really help the appreciation for the otherwise lackluster...everything, if you ask me.  The tacos are kind of a crap shoot, as they're mostly up to the customer and if one doesn't taste good, it's probably your fault. But, the quality of ingredients and assembly also play a part. I can say that the Coca Cola marinated steak is fantastic, but that's really the only impressive part of the menu. Better yet, just stick to the chips and salsa. The salsa is actually delicious and probably the only redeeming factor here--the guacamole was pretty meh and the queso was just queso, kind of hard to mess that up. Also, a huge problem--for my husband, not me so much--is the lack of soft corn shells. He's all about traditional tacos (think La Plaza) and he was hoping to mirror some of their options one night, but ended up without a soft corn option. We discovered that they have suggested tacos with soft corn shells, but they're just not on the regular menu. I imagine if you ask for those specifically, they'd make your taco with them...hopefully.   The El Diablo margarita is probably the best cocktail here, but beware any mixed drinks. We witnessed a large amount of watering down from one bartender. He didn't measure things and to make up for it, ended up just tossing a bunch of soda water into cocktails. But, that's only if you get a chance to put an order in. The service is a tad slow, but I can't blame them too much, because it gets pretty busy here after typical office hours.   Not my favorite place, but not the worst. I'll probably never turn down a $3.50 margarita during happy hour, but otherwise, it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Barrio! Such a tasty place in Lakewood. It is quick and easy and very very tasty. The tacos were amazing, definitely fresh and original. I loved that I could make my own on their unique ordering card. There were so many options!  The only thing I didn't love was the service. I hadn't been there before and I wasn't sure how to the ordering system worked and whether we would have a waiter, because we sat there and waited so long. Once the waiter came around, it was very quick service.   I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time visiting.  The tacos were very fresh and delicious.  They are a great deal for the price.  The margaritas were pretty weak, but they do use decent tequila.  The guac was a little bland for me, but I did like the salsa.  I would go back for happy hour or a late lunch."}
{"text":"Great experiences all 5 times. Fresh ingredients, great atmosphere, good servers. Love how you can build everything your self. I think some ingredient should change but overall great."}
{"text":"Barrio is a Cleveland staple. The tacos are the main attraction for sure. I recommend the stoner shell because it is simply really tasty. The blood orange margaritas are to die for as well. They also have a bunch of different types of queso. You wouldn't think melted cheese could get any better... yet somehow, they've done it!  Barrio has a large selection of drinks and quick service. They deal well with larger parties, however having less people will probably get you seated more quickly. The only real downside, and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that there has always been a long wait when I've gone. Not so bad if you're getting drinks to pass the time, but I hope Barrio chooses to open up even more locations than they already have and soon! Barrio also does phone orders, which is convenient for Cavs watch parties at my apartment!"}
{"text":"Kyle suggested a Marigold margarita which is out of my comfort zone but I loved it!! The selection was different but better than expected. I had a shrimp taco, el jefe taco and pork taco and I loved every bite!   Ask for Kyle. Have a margarita and enjoy the atmosphere. :)   We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I love barrio. I always get the same thing, and my favorite is the braised beef taco or bowl. It's good with chips and salsa. I also had the buffalo chicken taco (which is seasonal) and that was awesome. They never disappoint and are always quick! And I'm so glad they are open late... I get off work late and sometimes tacos are just screaming my name... beats taco bell any day of the week! I just wish they had a brunch. That would be awesome"}
{"text":"Loved the eclectic tacos and fun environment of the bar. Very attentive wait staff. I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a couple of drinks while we waited for our reservation at Red next door. They had a good selection of beers and something I'd never seen before, Jameson on tap. I'm very curious as to how liquor on tap works (and why a Mexican restaurant had whiskey on tap instead of tequila) but we didn't have the time to stay and investigate. The salsa and chips they gave us were excellent and I browsed the menu when we waited and it looked really good.  If we ever find ourselves in this neighborhood again, I'd love to stop in and try the food!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday. We sat outside. The chips have shaved salt  and are fresh made. The salsa is also very good. We ordered the margarita perfecto - yum! -  and guacamole to start. My husband ordered the El Jefe and I built vegetarian tacos. There was also a brunch menu but honestly there are sooo many choice and options that you can't go wrong. Great food, great drinks, and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos--delicious.  The chicken was tender and flavorful and the mango salsa was a nice combo of sweet and spicy.  Server/Bartender--so very friendly and took the time to explain some of the menu options to me when I asked (first timer!).  I didn't drink, but I should have after seeing them make sangria right in front of me.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The tacos here are great and have a fantastically huge variety of toppings to choose from.  The specials are always creative and and I've tried have been delicious.  The guacamoles have all been perfect every time I've ordered any one of them.  It can get really busy, especially in the summertime, but that's kind of expected when you serve great, affordable food.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is that they serve drinks in mason jars.  I don't know why that's a trend, but I think its annoying.  Its still well worth it."}
{"text":"Solid taco place, love the queso, especially the one with the corn.  This is the place I go to when I want something decadent and cheesy.  There is another places I go to for really solid authentic tacos.  The cocktails are good and they have a pretty nice beer list.  The patio is nice in the summer.  I have gone with my kids before but wouldn't prefer it, as it's not super kid-friendly in its design."}
{"text":"So good. We go here all the time and simply love it. The food is fresh and so reasonable and because it's so well priced, you can essentially stuff yourself with various tacos and queso. They have feature tacos of the month and also feature queso of the Month as well. When we went recently there was a mushroom and onion queso that was incredible.  The bar scene here in Tremont is great , but he warned that this Barrio is super small and gets sooooo crowded. The line can be two hours at times and for me, no taco is worth that.  Now that the patio is running, it's way easier and the lines are non existent. As for the drinks.... yum. They have a great selection of artisan margaritas and some great craft brews. Happy hour boasts half off the margaritas and tacos are one dollar less. Just great to go and really fun ."}
{"text":"Our first time there and we will be sure to come back. Good food at a good price. The build your own taco selection is perfect, not overwhelming and some very unique selections. Chef specials are great combinations as well. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. The chili tofu was outstanding and I'm not even a vegetarian. Our server Brian was great helped us understand the order process and was very knowledgable of the menu. We never wanted for drinks!  Thanks Brian!"}
{"text":"Building your own tacos is extremely fun.  The margaritas are awesome also.  The best time to go is during the summer so you can take advantage of the outside seating.  The first front room can get a little noisey when it's packed but not enough to have any issues for me.  The happy hour specials are amazing and definitely makes you want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Visited here a few weeks ago around 5pm and got some drinks while they were having some kitchen issues. Had to wait to be able to order food, no big deal. The drinks were decent and priced average for tremont, with some interesting selections. I liked the patio a lot, and the day of the dead decor. For an appetizer we attempted to order the queso, which they didn't have because of the kitchen issues, so we went with the salsa trio. It was okay at best, not much flavor like say orale or momocho but also priced at $15 not worth it at all. The verde salsa was identified on the menu as \"mild\". In actuality it was quite spicy (which we liked), but was warm (not room temp, WARM), and had a stringy consistency. The red salsa separated about 2 minutes after we got it. We both ordered the build your own tacos, a really cool concept pretty cheap at $3 each. The tacos were pretty good, it was difficult to taste the sauces and salsas, how on Earth a tasteless chipotle pepper sauce came to be, I have no idea. It was slow when we were there maybe 6 people in the entire place, and service was slow. Our server had no personality, and took away a drink that was still half full. Overall it wasn't worth the money, and I ended up sick."}
{"text":"Average food experience, poor staff interactions, hip location/vibe.   Came as a duo the night before Labor Day, which I know from experience as a server is a hellish shift, everyone's pre-gaming. Lucked out with 2 seats at the bar as opposed to a ~1hr wait. Bartender was busy, maybe swamped, and I had to ask him how to order food about 10 min after he gave us our sodas. To order food, you basically grab a pencil (provided) and fill out a paper application where the menu is listed, specifying which and how much taco you want. We turned in our homework and the bartender typed our order into the computer while publicly and kinda loudly expressing his frustrations about how his shift was progressing to another coworker. The bar was loud but there was definitely some palpable tension. I wanted to hop back there and help the guy, or at least tell him he was doing a good job, but I just tried to not be a needy customer. He apologized profusely to customers beside us about late food & drinks, overall gave us everything we needed. Except comfort.   Our chips& queso came out after about 10 minutes (and was so good), and our tacos came out about 30 minutes after that. I ordered a pulled pork taco that was designed by the kitchen, as well as a chicken taco from the same pre-designed plates menu. They were ok. The salsa that came in my taco made the whole thing kind of cold, which I wasn't pumped about. Not my thing, but maybe it could be yours?"}
{"text":"Best tacos anywhere. Was introduced to this place a few months back and find myself there almost once a week since then. Specials are awesome. Staff is quick."}
{"text":"Tacos taco tacos! So many flavor combinations will have you coming back again and again and the $3 price tag can't be beat. The construct your own menu style has something for everyone. Some favorite items are the stoner taco shell, chorizo and chipotle crema sauce.  If the idea of build your own is daunting and your looking for something delicious look no further than their monthly taco and queso specials. They also have delicious drink specials and flavored margaritas!  The happy hour form 4-7 p.m. cannot be beat $2 tacos and $3 margaritas. If you are more of a night owl they also have late night specials!"}
{"text":"You pick your own ingredients for tacos and the food was really good. Our server at the table was very good. The bar service however was not. It was a Friday night and the bar was busy and the 3 people working had a negative attitude. I would have docked them more, but the overall vibe and atmosphere was cool."}
{"text":"Love this location, food, service!  I'm a true Mexican and I love this place! Try the chorizo, bed tacos and the lobster queso!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. Friendly staff. A must try for any foodie in Cleveland."}
{"text":"No corn tortillas. Over-priced extras for rice ($1 for under a Tbsp). Okay vegetarian options (tofu)"}
{"text":"Everything from the eclectic decor to the delicious tacos was top notch. The wait wasn't too long (about 30 min) for a weekend night. It was well worth it! It was our first time but certainly won't be our last!"}
{"text":"Best value Mexican food in Cleveland. All tacos between $3-4.  Flavor and food quality are fantastic. The vibe is funky cool day of the dead chic. Bar is always hopping. Environment is great for all types (young, old, couples, families). Their catering service is great too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I live close by and it took me a little while to warm up to this place. Once I pretty much tested every taco combination on the menu I love this place. The queso is amazing and every month they have a flavor of the month queso. Recently it was bruschetta queso and it was amazing!   The staff and service are always quick and they now have a patio. Which from what I hear from my apt is very popular.   I recommend this place for a quick bite to eat when you just can't really decide what you want."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! They make it very easy with the sheets to customize what you want and try something new. Margaritas were great. Chips and salsa provided. It all adds up, but they have a pretty stellar happy hour deal.   This place has been highly recommended to me. No wonder it's so popular. Waited about 45 min for a table for two on a Wednesday, so definitely plan on a wait."}
{"text":"The service was great but the food was gross. I ordered custom tacos that had about 5 little pieces or chicken in it, which was literally nothing. Being Mexican it's one of the worst Mexican places I've been to and I love tacos. Don't go here if you want good authentic tacos. It would only be good if you were drunk. Extremely disappointed how horrible the food was."}
{"text":"I love their concept and the food. I'm always up for a good taco, and of the many choices in Lakewood, they're easily in the top 2.  I'd give them 4 stars, except that they're always packed, and I don't like loud, crowded places. If they could install some soundproofing it might help."}
{"text":"Only had drinks here so can't comment on the food (other than the free chips and salsa which were tasty).  GREAT beer selection, both bottles and on tap.  Unlike some other reviews, we had very good service while sitting at the bar.  This even though it was only an hour before a home Tribe game.  Both the margarita and sangria were excellent.  Will have to stop back and try to tacos."}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos at this place. I tried the braised beef, shredded chicken and shredded pork. Loved them all! A lot of places seem to have tasteless chicken but not Barrio. You can build your tacos with a nice selection of toppings, salsas, and sauces to get them just the way you want. Best queso dip I've ever had, too! The margaritas are a little weak, but good. You can get them with an excellent cayenne-sugar mixture on the rim. Has a bit of that hole in the wall dive atmosphere and parking is mostly on the street but well worth a little extra effort."}
{"text":"Two Words: Amazing Margaritas!  Oh yeah, and the food is really good too!  I love the design-your-own style of the menu. Adventurous people might end up with a taco they don't totally love if they try to pile every possible topping on at one time.  Its a place with infinite possibilities, so plan to go back many times.    The atmosphere is great and they have very good beer & spirits offerings."}
{"text":"Great hipster little place. Build your own tacos or order a specialty one. Great flavor. Would go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we are HUGE Barrio fans. We have been to the Tremont & Lakewood locations numerous times. Our whole family loves it. We are Eastsiders and we were thrilled to see they were coming to CH. waited a few months after opening to let them get the \" kinks\" out. Went last weekend- what a disappointment !!  Service was fine. Tacos were swimming in grease. Pork and brisket were so salty they were inedible! We are hoping the other locations have not gone down the same road. Won't be returning to CH location anytime soon"}
{"text":"Great build your own tacos via checklist.  Tacos are large and flavorful for $3 each.  Unique and tasty shells, proteins, veggies, salsas and sauces.  My only complaint is that they only do lunch on Friday out of the five-day week."}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Finally, the perfect patio in the Cleve. The patio is large enough that you can usually get a seat but not adjacent to a dirty parking lot. The inside dining area is chill, funky, and a bit edgy. You don't feel like you are slumming it, but you also don't feel like you need a jacket in order to dine. Can we say 1st date spot? 2nd date spot? Fake date spot? Night out with your sisters? Olé!    I came twice in 24 hours. My only suggestion? A milder salsa with the chips. The second time I came I requested a milder salsa, which is the salsa verde. I'm not a wimp when it comes to spice, but the roja is crazy hot for dipping chips. Both trips my dining partners agreed. We couldn't stop ourselves from dipping but then we regretted it by drinking all our water and having to flag down a server for water refills. I don't think it would be too hot for me on a taco, but it is too much by itself. Perhaps management has already remedied the spicy salsa roja situation, but I'd ask your server when you first sit down on how hot the salsa served with chips will be.   I had so much fun creating my taco from the menu that I kept my order slip and brought it with me for next time. Yes, I actually did this.  And there are tons of gluten free options, señoritas! (You guys, I just spent 20 minutes looking up how to add a tilde! Congrats to Amy for doing it! Olé)"}
{"text":"Food is Good but the hype about this place is way way more than the food..prices are a bit much for the amount of food and its a create you're taco kind of place...place is very small and good luck on parking."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in and were pleasantly surprised. We were there for brunch in a Saturday. He raved about the cheddar jalapeño biscuit with chorizo gravy. He also enjoyed the sangria. I took a sip and found it to be a little sweet for my taste... but I thought my margarita was also a tad too sweet. The chili lime salt rim really upped my margarita a notch. I created two tacos. I loved the innards but my poor corn tortillas started falling apart quickly. It appears they needed to be heated up a little more before being filled with goodies. I did require my food to be gluten free so I don't know if the non heated/minimally heated tortillas were to avoid cross contamination or not but it could use improvement.   Also, we'll be bringing our own silverware next time. The plastic sporks didn't cut it for us."}
{"text":"Good, cheap and fun. Trendy and quirky. We liked it, we'll be back. The steak and shrimp tacos were great, and also the chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because why don't I think of this stuff?     ---   ---   ---  My Mom always told me I was smart, so why is it that my brain didn't invent a Build Your Own Taco Menu? Who would hear about something like that and react with anything other than euphoria? Not someone I want to hang out with, that's for sure.  I couldn't even tell you what exactly I ordered. There were so many choices, I gave up on logic and just filled out the card with my heart. I know that one had a shrimp base, one had a Coca-Cola marinated steak base. I believe the other one was pulled pork. It doesn't really matter, because they were all wonderful.   You know what else was wonderful? The chips and guac. Also, our server.  Oh, and you know what else was wonderful? After Barrio, we went and watched the Cavs decimate the Warriors in Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals at the Q. And then you know what happened a couple days later.  I credit tacos."}
{"text":"Was there on a packed Saturday night. Been there at least 3x and food to us has always been out quickly and tastes awesome! They carry Clevelands Blaze sauces, which if you haven't had them, are awesome!  The tap beers are great and the drinks are as well.  Their service at the bar, was outstanding!  For as busy as they were, they were attentive to us and everyone else like there were 5 people there.  That's amazing when you consider how small the bar area is."}
{"text":"Barrio is a Cleveland must! It's also a must to go back more than once, as you need 3 or 4 trips to really try all of the different options. I'm all about mixing and matching so this place is a dream come true. Ingredients seem high quality and fresh. Their different guacs are all worth a try too. I've also tried 2 of their signature cocktails, which I can't remember the name now, they're on the expensive side but definitely unique enough to be worth it."}
{"text":"I would give them 5 stars but the waits are ridiculous and I waited over 15 minutes at the bar just for guacamole, which wasn't that good. Besides the wait, the tacos are great and affordable!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic meal!  Great atmosphere, great service.  Food was original and spectacular- guacomole is amazing, and creating your own tacos from those choices will be a treat for anyone."}
{"text":"I live this place. The drinks, the atmosphere, the food. I like building my own tacos. The fact the drinks are sizable and come in mason jars is a big win for me. I wish the place was slightly bigger. I can get a little crowded."}
{"text":"Good food in Lakewood, bathroom are very dirty"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing and so are the margaritas. I truly do believe Barrio's has the best margaritas at every location.  However, I'm not particularly fond of this location. Last time we went, the service was poor. I came in with my boyfriend and his best friend and I believe our waitress assumed I was their daughter. We all ordered pop at first and mine was the only one to come in a mason jar like they serve to kids while the others had normal glasses. Once we got our food, I ordered a margarita. I was the only one ID'ed in our group. Both the others were clearly under 40 and while I do look very young, I was actually pretty insulted to be treated like a kid. Especially because I am pretty sure I was older than the server. She didn't seem to spend much time at our table either, trying to avoid us as much as possible.   I really dislike this location based on this experience. But I still love the other ones."}
{"text":"It's a very hip, lively atmosphere. So sorry, Michael, but Barrio is a misnomer. No corn tortillas. Anyone who has been to barrio in any Hispanic country knows what I am talking about. It's culture vulture-dom at its worst (vs at its best, i.e. Pok Pok). I wasn't able to enjoy a listed taco recipe or self-created one, ordered 5. Perhaps the cook at the grill didn't realize he was over cooking everything."}
{"text":"We were visiting to see a show at Quicken Loans Arena and were looking for an inexpensive yet quick and delicious place to eat before the show. That's when yelp found us Barrio. We were there mid day around three pm so we got seated right away. The menu is very simple. Tacos. Either build your own or choose from the pre-created options. Our party of 4 all created our own. All were fresh and delicious! Super reasonable priced at $3 to $4 a piece. Plus you get unlimited chips and salsa for the table. Great local beers too. Highly recommended!! Would definitely revisit when we are in town again."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. Food is tasty. There is a bit of a wait on a Saturday night, but they cycle through tables quickly because the service is so quick. So don't be deterred if you see a long line outside. The interiors are super cool and hip. Young crowd. Rock music. Good size margaritas. I'm definitely coming back.   My mother hated it."}
{"text":"Tacos are good. Best I've had locally. Guacamole average. Had the traditional. Great beer selection. Service was prompt, efficient, accurate, attentive, but oddly cold and detached, from bar tender, food runners, and waitress. Eye contact and a genuine engagement doesn't take much. Maybe I'm not hipster compatible. Prices are surprisingly reasonable. Will be back."}
{"text":"Though I was not feeling tacos I'm glad my friends dragged me here. First off this is not your average taco especially when you build it yourself and load em up gooood!  Got 3 tacos, steak was one of my fav., then lamb (special), then fish of the day, not a huge fish fan but it wasn't bad at all.   In regards to the shells the stoner was a nice double decker (hard+soft), the widow had a nice creamy add to it due to the sour cream and guac. The plain flour was your standard soft flour tortilla and wasn't bad due to all the add-ons in me taco.  The Carolina reaper was a perfect habanero hot with great flavor. Enough to make you sweat and have a runny nose but not enough to make you die. Unfortunately when I asked for it in 2 of my tacos they gave it to me on the side and only 1/4 of a sauce cup so had to ask for extra (given the wrong one the first time when I asked). The secret sauce for one of the tacos wasn't on the side so don't know if they put it in or not : / also there was some of my fish in my lamb taco which made it weird.  Their tequila selection is on point, however they did put a lime in my anejo without asking which was slightly upsetting but I was too tired TL to complain.  If there were no mishaps then 5 stars all day. Otherwise I'd say a 3.75 stars."}
{"text":"gave it another chance. tried a suggested taco and it was the best ive had there yet.."}
{"text":"Late night craving, check.  Solid tacos check, cool neighborhood, check.  Cool spot to meet friends for dinner or drinks and it checks off a lot of the boxes.  One of the better taco joints in cleveland."}
{"text":"Barrio's gives me life.   You cannot beat the happy hour here by a long shot. $2 tacos and $4 mason jar margaritas.    I have been to this place 3 times and I have yet to be disappointed. The food is always delicious and caters to any and every kind of food palette.   I like the idea of filling out a card for what you want in your taco(s). There are so many combinations. My favorite has to be the braised beef in the corn tortilla with the corn salsa, onions, lettuce, and the cilantro lime aioli.   Since it is so busy from open to close, it can take a little bit to get your tacos, but in Barrio's case that's ok because: 1.You can't rush quality tacos and these, my friends, are top quality 2.They give you bottomless complimentary chips and salsa while you wait.   I haven't explored the margarita menu as much as I have wanted, but I do feel confident stating that the Jade Olmec has to be the best drink I have ever had. In my opinion, it feels like it is a cross between a mojito and a margarita.  It is so refreshing and crisp.    Keep doing what you're doing, Barrio's."}
{"text":"Barrio is a true icon, and nothing beats the downtown location. Hands down the best tacos I've ever had, and the guacamole is pretty incredible too.  I've been here at least ten times and I've never had even a single bad experience. The staff are friendly, the food is great, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Walked by this place on a sunny Saturday afternoon and decided we wanted tacos. Sat outside on the patio and watched the peeps passing by looking for places to eat or heading to Progressive field or even the casino. You order your custom taco by filling out a slip that allows you to pick everything you want on your taco; I liked that system. We each picked a made to order taco and I also ordered a dirty taco off their menu. I enjoyed both and my wife enjoyed hers as well. Also enjoyed a Lagunitas brew on the sunny patio. All for about $20, a good deal. Looking forward to coming back here in the near future."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! The margaritas are awesome and I love that the tacos are only $3!! The pineapple salsa is SOO good! Also you really can't go wrong with queso, salsa, and tortilla chips!!"}
{"text":"Three dollar tacos; (the best) free chips & salsa.  I mean, what else is there to say? You can pretty much customize your food however you'd like, they give you a check list with so many options. Somethings like rice are a dollar add on- but they pack'em enough to be satisfying. Also, there's a massive drink selection including a bunch of local brews as well as some great mix drinks- did I mention there's $2 margs during happy hour? It's honestly the bomb, but usually there is a wait time since it gets so packed during the time everyone craves a taco-- but if you can wait it out, it's always been a good experience! Choose from the many options wisely my friend and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh Barrio, how I love your build-your-own taco concept, your delicious margaritas, large wine pours, and yummy guacamole. However, to keep a 5 star rating you are going to have to up your service game. It took 25 minutes from sitting down to get 3/3 drinks for our table, another 15 or so to get waters. The waitress forgot about the guacamole order, but this was comped. Super slow and fragmented service overall. Our waitress said they opened the patio without adequate staff today, and it could take over an hour to get our tacos when we ordered - at that point we had already waited 25 mins. Uhh thanks for the heads up. Luckily it didn't take that long, but that soured the experience. If they let us know when checking in at the restaurant, it would have managed our expectations. The food overall was on par for Barrio - the pescado del dia, a cornflake crusted mahi mahi, was delicious! The service is in need of attention."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars/restaurants to visit, it also helps that my fiance is borderline obsessed with Mexican food. Have been here for both brunch and dinner, and have always been pleased. Be prepared to wait here because it's a popular place, but the waits are rarely unreasonable. I have never had bad service here. Only once do I remember a longish wait for food, and it wasn't long, just long for Barrio. The last time we were here was for brunch, and I always forget how good it is. For brunch I usually get tacos off the special brunch taco menu, but I always like their build-your-own tacos menu, and it is easy to get the proper order since you fill out and hand them the sheet. Last time I tried the chicken and waffles taco, as a big fan of chicken and waffles. It was average, but the other tacos are very good. My necessity is to always order one of the seasonal french toast bowls, which I would recommend to anyone. I usually wash this all down with a house margarita. Definitely a worthwhile restaurant that I would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner recently, and this was reconfirmed as my favorite local Mexican restaurant. Be it for brunch, lunch, or dinner, Barrio will always please. As with the other locations, if not here early, be prepared to wait as it is a popular spot. As always, a personal favorite here is their menu, where you fill it out and turn it in to your server to eliminate the possibility of a miscommunication or error in the kitchen. for the indecisive people, there is always a current menu with preset tacos which usually have a tasty combo of ingredients. As with most Mexican restaurants, the premeal chips and salsa are solid. My fiance always seems to fill up on these, although she will consistently claim that next time she won't. The draft list is pretty solid and margaritas are both tasty and a reasonable price/size. Taco wise, I usually go for the Green Goddess shells (picture a Taco Bell cheesy gordita crunch with guacamole replacing the cheese). I have never been disappointed with an order, and there are a variety of toppings to accommodate any taste and fans of any level of heat on their tacos. This is a favorite of ours, and always one that is considered when we go out. A personal favorite plan of our is to come here for brunch before a matinee for the tribe. No matter when you come, Barrio will never disappoint"}
{"text":"Great place, awesome food!!! Very reasonable price with satisfying variety of tacos  the chihuahua cheese is definitely one of the best cheese I've ever had  definitely will be back here again next time I visit Cleveland area"}
{"text":"Yeah, no.  We waited and waited for an outside table.  We were finally on our way there and then we ran into some old neighbors.  Said hello, went to our table and someone else took it.  They apologized, you get the next one.  WTH, 20 minutes later there is one and they gave it to someone else.  The old neighbor went to ask for management.  No one knew who manager was.  Then after one hour of losing the first table we had a table.  Problem, cold, sun going down. Nearly dark.  Three kinds of wine.  Really don't you make more money of alcohol?  They are like we are tequilla bar.  Fair enough, i'll do water.  Food not the best.  Freezing cold outside.  You know the hostess is the most important job.  Figure it out.  Won't be back.  Lovely setting out back, if it wasn't 9:00 when we got a table...."}
{"text":"always good eats.  Grab a sheet, select your stuff and place your order.  Not confident in your ability to mix and match your own ingredients?  Shame on you first of all, but go with one of the Barrio pre-fab taco ideas. Whatever you do, get the White Widow taco shell to start. And don't forget the queso appetizer with elote.  Darn good food, bustling atmosphere, and a good time will be had by all."}
{"text":"Out of all the Barrios, I think the Tremont one is the best. Fast service, great patio, and they STUFF their tacos (seriously - the tacos you'd get at the downtown location are half the fillings). Get the queso and a jalapeño margarita, and try the El Jefe selections if you can't make up your mind about what combo to try."}
{"text":"Cool place with good interesting Mexican styled tacos. Great for the evening or weekend bar scene.   Good services as well."}
{"text":"THE BEST FOOD IN TOWN. It's pointless to order tacos anywhere else in Cleveland. Tacos are unbelievable, super affordable, and free chips! Service is often poor and servers are more than likely going to be rude but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, but service was so-so, maybe due to a large population coming in to eat!"}
{"text":"Came in with a group of 6 or so. Not too late, 11pm for a city, not late enough to SCREW UP MY ORDER....you know, the order that you literally WRITE down yourself? And have for reference in case you forget?  Whatever. Big deal. Au contraire, we have more for you, first time visitor! What's that you say? Roll your eyes at the patron?  There's more!  Let's take 15 minutes to come back with the bill, long enough for me to preemptively call my card company and say, yeah I'm pretty sure the bartender who looks like she came out of The Warriors outtake has sold my CC online. They asked me what I ate in the \"neighborhood\", I said three tacos that tasted like metal and salsa, thanks though   Establishments should look or feel sticky. Minus 100 points for flipping the lights on 15 minutes prior to last call, any more light and I would have thought I was going to heaven."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here for the first time, the food was great. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what all the hype is about this place. I guess the \"build your own tacos\" sounds very appealing. The wait wasn't too bad, we waited about 20 min to be seated. So you basically have a check list of what you want. You can pick what kind of tortilla, protein, toppings, sauces, and so on. The quality of the food was not as expected. I got the green goddess tortilla which sounded so good when I read it and it was a 1 extra but when I got it there was like a teaspoon of each ingredient in the tortilla and I could taste that the guacamole was old. They really don't put much in your tacos so make sure you check a lot of things because they literally put like a teaspoon of whatever you want. I had the shrimp and it was gross, very fishy tasting. The cola marinated steak was good. But that's about it. I would not go back to that place. There are better places to go eat in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"The reviews are accurate! It was a great experience...went there on a Wednesday for happy hour (4-7pm) and ordered two $2 tacos. Both were delicious and super filling. I love how many options they offer for customizing your tacos at the low price! The best part was the guac though....and the 1/2 priced margaritas. We got the Tuscan guacamole and it was SOOO GEWD. Creamy but chunky and full of flavor and texture. The goat cheese definitely adds to it. Also...definitely order the jalapeno margarita if you like a little kick to your beverage. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I was so stoked when I learned that a Barrio was opening on the east side. I've had two really fantastic meals at their Tremont location, and countless drinks in Lakewood. Unfortunately, they've really screwed the pooch at this location.   Last night some guys and I went out for a drink. None of us had been to the new Barrio yet so we were really excited.  The place was packed, but since we were just having drinks we were very happy to stand. Be warned, however, that the layout for standing there sucks -- they have a mini-ledge for drinks along the front wall, but then their hostess will just keep shoving you if you try to stand there. Whatever. Again, I tried not to let it bother me and I chalked it up to the fact they're so new.   Eventually we all sat down at the bar and ordered a queso to accompany our third round of drinks. (We'd been there about 2 hours already.) The bartender who first got to us seemed cool, but he definitely had a hearing problem. (Perhaps a disability, but more likely just couldn't hear us -- something about the way the speakers are setup made the ambient noise ridiculously echo-ish in and around the bar.)  So he screwed up two of our beers, and put the entire round on someone else's tab. (Not one of the four of us in my party.)  When a check didn't come, I gave him my card and requested that he bill us properly. He fixed that, and the two beers, really promptly. His attitude was exactly as it should have been -- not too apologetic, but definitely like \"sorry man couldn't hear you. yeah thanks for letting me know.\" etc.   Then the appetizer came, delivered by someone from the kitchen (not one of the bartenders). It was the wrong one. Before he set it down, I told him \"I think you've got the wrong order - that's not ours.\" Then I looked at everyone in my group and asked, \"Did anyone order guacamole?\" Everyone shook their head no, so I clarified to him, \"I ordered Queso Blanco.\" The kitchen guy said, \"Oh, no problem. Well you guys can have the guacaomole and I'll get you the queso too.\" We asked, \"You sure?\" He said, \"Yeah man, of course. Our bad.\" So everyone was happy. UNTIL the queso arrived.   It was brought out a few minutes later by a third person, a woman from the kitchen or front end. She stood there looking at us eating the guacamole as though we were a bunch of deceitful hyenas. I said, \"You're at the right place -- thanks for bringing the queso.\" She replied, with a really mean tone (I'd use a different word, but I don't like gendered language) \"Ummmm, I'm not setting this down until you give me the guacamole.\"  And we were all like, \"huh?\" She repeated herself, \"You can't have both. You're not getting both. Give me the guacamole.\" I laughed and began to hand her the small plastic molcajete, but halfway there one of my friends grabbed my arm and took it. He was NOT HAPPY with this development. None of us were. But this was his firstime there, he's lived in Cle Hts his hole life, and it just seemed like he couldn't fathom such rude customer service at a restaurant in his hometown. So he asked her, in a much friendlier but clearly indignant tone, \"The guy who dropped it off told us to eat it. We didn't order it, but its here now and you told us to enjoy it. So what do you want it for now? Are you just going to throw that away.\" She said, \"Yeah, and you're not getting another bite.\" We couldn't believe her attitude. He quickly relented, gave her the guac, and complained to the bartender -- who had overheard the whole thing. My friend said, \"Dude, are you kidding me?!? That's really messed up.\" The bartender just said, \"Yeah. I agree.\"    Needless to say, that was our last round of drinks, and we went over to the Fairmont."}
{"text":"It's just the \"go to\" spot in cleveland is the easiest way I can put it. Whether it's midnight and your just craving some bomb tacos. Or happy hour where they have half off margaritas. I always loved coming to the Tremont location in the summer, there back patio just gives you feels- the lights, seeing the stars, eating tacos. What more can you ask? The concept of making your own is fun because you can always mix it up or just stick to your recipe once you've perfected it (speaking for myself). The decor inside is original with a cute fireplace in the winter. It's in the perfect locations in all three cities- downtown, Tremont, and Lakewood. Any location, you really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place....always delicious and fun...fantastic place to meet up for drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times mostly for happy hour which starts at 4 (make sure you go early!). Despite their margaritas being on the sugary side, you can't beat their happy hour price. I also really like their tacos. If you get enough filling, two tacos are more than enough to make you full.   The reason why this barrio gets 3/5 is because their tacos are so watery. I don't know if it's because they don't drain their vegetables, but when I picked up my taco, liquid was pouring out from the ends, which made the taco shell soggy and made all the salsa slide off. There was so much liquid that the entire bottom of my tray was covered in a layer.   I was a little disappointed because I used to come to this location quite often, and it's sad to see the quality go down. The drinks are the same as before, but I don't remember the tacos being that watery.   All in all, I will still come to this location only for happy hour because of its close proximity to campus and its prices."}
{"text":"Was staying in Ohio for the weekend and was told that there was a great Mexican restaurant local. Barrio is located downtown and the bright lights and wording Tacos and Tequila drug me right in. The decor is amazing. Night of the Dead Mexican theme. The bar celling light area is like a coffin. The music playing was great and atmosphere was awesome. I brought my kids who are teens and they loved it. ESP my daughter who is totally into this stuff.   We were greeted immediately and they made seating available for a party of 6. Ordering is different than most restaurants. You get to fill out an ordering slip on what tacos you would like and hand it into the waitress. So many good selections to choose from!    The food was amazing. We all had tacos with many different selections inside. Their adult drinks come in a mason jar which is awesome!   I so wish these restaurants were in my area. I highly recommend this place if your visiting Ohio!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I are both restaurant workers and yelp is the bane of our existence but after our experience today, I downloaded the app just to tell my story. We were attending a concert and really wanted to try barrio for the first time. There was a tribe game and we waited 35 minutes for a table. I had been told that the portions were small so we ordered 6 tacos a person for 3 people. FYI unless you are a glutton the portions are lovely. We definitely over ordered. The guacamole was fresh and bright and delicious. I could definitely taste (and feel) the liquor in the drinks. The server was on point and had plenty of help. The food took close to an hour. We had to leave. I should've allowed more time for dinner. When we informed a manager of our dilemma, he had our tacos boxed and comped therm. All 16. You can imagine it was substantial. I was blown away. In this business, sh!t happens and it's all about the recovery. Nice recovery guys. The tacos were SUPERB and we really appreciate the gesture. We'll be back soon and with ample time for the experience. Thank you again"}
{"text":"Great tacos, drinks, and guacamole! Very lively bar like atmosphere, so it can get a little crazy but has a nice vib. as well as cool design. Lots of great vegetarian selections, including vegan. I think I've heard that they originated as a food truck business which I guess accounts for limiting their menu to tacos, chips, and salsas. It would be nice if they offered some other items for variety's sake. What they do offer is very good. I've only been to the Lakewood location."}
{"text":"This place has a cool atmosphere and is overall good. I gave it 3 stars because the chips and salsas were very salty along with some of the tacos and the hostess was extremely rude."}
{"text":"This place has awesome margaritas served in mason jars for a very good price.  Their tacos are delicious.  I love the ability to personalize as many tacos you can manage to happily eat.  If you have a spicy to tongue, the food isn't spicy.  But you're in luck, they have a wide selection of hot sauces including one that had ghost chilies (I was terrified when one of my friends brought it to the table...I think my stomach was quivering in fear of the thought of trying it).  If you manage to save room for desert, the sopapillas and choco-tacos are delicious.   Service was good and friendly, but getting a table is tough especially on Friday and Saturday evenings."}
{"text":"I went to the Madison Ave location with my boyfriend for dinner this past week. I wish I could tell you how the food was but no one came over to serve us! Overall this was probably the most awkward restaurant experience I have ever had. When we got there we were seated right away and brought chips shortly after.  After 10 minutes several waitresses and what I assume to be the manager had walked by, looked at our table, then walked away. Now another couple, who had come in after us, had been seated and waited on. After 15 minutes of trying to get someone attention, we had finished the chips and had our order tickets ready to go. At this point we had been awkwardly side eyed by waitresses and waiters 10+ times.  After 20 minutes the couple directly next to us had their food and it was so uncomfortable being there that we decided to leave. No one stopped us either. I have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant. I would not go back to this location not because of the food (Still wondering how it is) but because of how uncomfortable to staff made me and my boyfriend feel."}
{"text":"very neat! this is how my grandma writes me e-mails, so i have adopted her style. this place rocks!! my socks off (i hate socks, so it works out). always have been a big sandal guy, except those adidas sandals, with the bumps on them, i never really understood those, but i did own a pair. i am rambling the tacos here taste like a tiny slice of hell (the good part, like the drugs and stuff) and a tiny slice of heaven (the angels/chicks).  no joke tho, these tacos are bomb, prices are good, cool vibe/atmosphere (whichever word you rather use), and margs are pretty much on point as well.  ive been to this one and the one in treemont, both legit!!  theres one coming to downtown, which im pumped about, since i work there (for money), yelp"}
{"text":"Been here several times and is definitely a favorite in the Cle area. Full package here. Great food, great/quick service and unbeatable prices for fresh and quality food."}
{"text":"I am absolutely addicted to this place. The only downside is driving to Lakewood. I wish they had a location more west.   My favorite thing is being able to pick my own items. I have some food allergies (gluten, avocado), so that setup makes my life so much easier. Each item is so flavorful all on its own. Even the sour cream is the freshest thing I've ever tasted.   There's usually a wait, but it goes fast and is SO worth it. As I said, my only suggestion is to open more on the west side. Keep up the good work (although my waist line would disagree)."}
{"text":"What can I say? Amazing food, amazing booze, great service and wonderful atmosphere. One of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"The reason why I am giving this review 1 star is only because my Co-workers and I have tried to have lunch here 5 TIMES! And the wait has been CRAZY! PLEASE DO ONE OF TWO THINGS...  allow reservation or open a second day for Lunch!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite place to eat.  Even the one time that I recieved the wrong order, I still liked it! Lol  And, it's right at the bottom of my street!"}
{"text":"Build your own taco is fun. But the margaritas are the reason to go here.  Not wimpy.  Have their own blend of margarita mix just right."}
{"text":"Brenden the bartender was rude and disrespectful!!! At the Lakewood location my friends and I were waiting for a table near the service ally. Brenden yelled and rudely told us to move which I get, we were in the way. We moved and tried to order drinks.Forced to move from the bar due to my ID Supposly not looking like me..... right.... thank god Im a bartender and server myself. I was able handle the situation well and get my margaritas!! Our server was amazing!! It's sad though she saw what happened to me and said \"yea he's always an asshole, try working with him.\" You obviously need to attitude check your bartenders if their not only being rude to customers but their fellow coworkers. UNACCEPTABLE"}
{"text":"Build your own tacos! Great atmosphere. Cool staff. Sometimes requires a little patience but usually worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I loves tacos and I love guacamole with all my heart.  They are two of the simplest, easiest things to make delicious in this hard, unforgiving life.  Sometimes I think guacamole is all I have to get me through the day.  That said you fuck with guacamole, you fuck with my life.  Barrio'a guac is the texture and color of baby poo only it is less flavorful.  (Assuming baby poo has a flavor which it certainly smells like I would.  What I am saying is, I've never actually eaten baby poo)  I have a feeling they make it a day or two ahead of time.  That's really infuriating. Guyzzz!  Guacamole is such a simple thing to make delicious!!  WHY DOES IT NOT TASTE DELICIOUS AT BARRIO???  I have been to both locations a few times.  The second time I had an actual living bug walk out of my taco to say hello.  Still, I came back when the Lakewood location opened.  I ordered a guacamole with peach preserves and shaved chocolate on top thinking even if it sucks, at least it will be interesting tasting.  I was wrong.  It was not interesting tasting at all, in fact it had no flavor.  How is this possible??  Do they have a flavor zapping machine in the kitchen??   Lastly, I ordered a choco taco from the Tremont location and almost broke my tooth on the freezer burned monstrosity that was served to me.  Guys.  It was a prepackaged frozen choco taco, not some artisan creation.  I'm fine with that, though slightly disappointed,  but you should not be able to fuck up a prepackaged frozen dessert!!    And I ask myself, how in the world are they able to open up a second location?? The only answer I can think of is: Clevelanders are drunk most of the time and suffer from severe low self esteem.  We don't think we deserve better.  And maybe we don't.  Wait, I thought I was done but I forgot to bitch about the service.  Seriously slow.  Y'all are making tacos.  Happy Dog will have my stupid hotdog made in like two minutes with a packed bar.  Take some lessons from them."}
{"text":"I am surprise to see so many good reviews!!! The place itself it's okay but the food it's awful! I can understand if you have never tried real Mexican food but if you did just avoid this place!  I went there with 3 friends and none of them enjoyed this place. The food was gross and and fat and the chicken smelled. I build my own bowl...and I got a coffee cup that looked like an appetizer! Seriously guys?  At least it's very cheap, but I would have eat better going to a fast food!  If you like real good food, avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Barrio is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I've been many times, and never been disappointed. Margaritas and tacos are fresh, there are countless options for mixing and matching tacos, and it is easy to make a big group of people with varying dietary needs (e.g., vegetarian, vegan, GF, etc.) happy. The house salsa (served automatically upon being seated) is spicier than most, but fantastic! I would recommend skipping the queso and investing in guacamole instead, which is a pretty generous scoop."}
{"text":"Taco's are okay, gaucamole is decent. I actually found a piece of glass in my salsa or gaucamole last time :/.  I have had terrible service there as well. Its an okay place, I'd just go there for the cheap tacos and happy hour.  I feel like the tacos and gauc use to be good when they first opened but the taste is going downhill."}
{"text":"This was the rudest wait staff I have ever experienced. We were waiting for a table and got some drinks at the bar. Every member of the staff that walked through complained about where we were waiting. I asked a waiter where else to wait and he said \"Anywhere else.\" After we we're seated our waitress was average. If we should not wait by the bar please provide an alternate place to wait or tell us you do not want our business."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place today! We are from Dallas Texas, where you can throw a rock up in the air and it will probably land on a taco joint. Since we are new to Cleveland, and haven't found much for authentic Mexican cuisine, my husband and I were thrilled to hear about Barrio. Today we tried one of each of the brunch tacos, as well as chips and salsa and guacamole. The chips were fresh, and this place even gave us chip refills without us needing to ask. They are not stingy with the chips! Pretty good salsa as well. The brunch tacos seemed rather experimental. The chicken and waffles taco was kind of gross.. especially with the collard greens. The salmon taco was weird but.. I mean.. what do you expect ordering a salmon taco? I enjoyed my other two brunch tacos of huevos rancheros and huevos con machaca. They could have been warmer and had a little too much sour cream for my taste.. We will definitely return to try the regular tacos! I also loved the atmosphere! Really cool walls and decor overall.   One suggestion: soft corn tortillas would be much appreciated and make these tacos more authentic.  Update: I have eaten at Barrio two more times and tried all sorts of tacos and both times were disappointing because I feel this restaurant has potential to be so much better. Are cold and creamy tacos the hip cool popular thing here in Cleveland? I didn't want to finish mine. I couldn't. For the price, these tacos should be much more fresh, and definitely hot! The last time I visited Barrio, they didn't even get our order right. I'm confused. On a cold rainy weekend night, people pile into Barrio by the bunches and stand around with mediocre margaritas waiting for a seat at the bar or a table. So good for Barrio! The demand is there. I think the issues here is Barrio's ability to deliver quality tacos to such a continuous high capacity and demand.   So again, Barrio, I may return in a year to see if the tacos have improved because I really want to like this place but I have had really below average tacos here 3 times in a row."}
{"text":"The margaritas are SO good. And the tacos come out hot, fresh, and quickly. The wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, really good beer selection, and free stand up comedy every so often. Their super hot sauce is actually really friggin' hot and not a gimmick like most places. You must try their tacos."}
{"text":"I was here meeting a friend and we sat on the patio. Chips and salsa were there when I got there and were very good, the queso is a must. The drinks were awesome and the tacos were so stellar. I got one hard shell and one of the other ones...the one that's like a double taco, so yummy. The service was sub par. The server was pretty clear that it was time to leave \"Are you ready for your check yet\" I didn't even get to finish my food. She dropped our check and came back very quickly asking if we were ready, I've never been kicked out of a place before it was very off putting. Maybe I'll try Tremont next time or just get take out."}
{"text":"I went back here and wanted to up my rating a bit since I did have an overall good experience this time but I will still say that the service is not so hot here!   What I love about this place is the food - really fantastic stuff. I have yet to be disappointed by these tacos. I forget what they call it but they have a hard/soft shell combo with guac and queso that is insanely good. Really reasonably priced, as well, I think. The appetizers are a little pricey and I'm not sure if they're worth it but this may be my favorite taco place in the area at this point.   Like I mentioned, services is still just meh. I ate at the bar so we had no real issues but they just weren't terribly friendly or attentive. Better than last time but still room for improvement. Just be prepared for the possibility that the service will suck but the food will definitely be tasty!"}
{"text":"Stopped last night late as most other places were closed and have been meaning to check it out.  Not going to be redundant and explain the interior or other things at have already been mentioned - this review is about food, beer and service.   Food - I was fairly impressed. Sure, it is tough to blow a taco, but these were very good. I had one crunchy shell with pulled pork, red cabbage, soft white cheese and the hot salsa and one soft with beef, slaw, smoked cheddar and the special sauce. First was better but both good. Wife had some kind of chorizo deal and one of the specials - the fish with a jalapeño tartar. she liked both, especially the fish.  Beer - Meh, not that impressive. A few Great Lakes beers, but mostly out of state stuff that isn't very good. Been to Whiskey Dogg and the tap list is lacking locals as well. You might say it is better to have the out of state stuff because it is harder to come by, but it isn't and can all be found at the local store. Besides, the beer being brewed in Ohio is better than 95 percent of other states' beer, so that is what I prefer.  Service  - Pretty good, no problems. Bartender actually was helpful with some food queries."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The bartender was very rude and ignored us for over an hour. Never experienced this at the other locations. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great tacos, fantastic drinks, cool bar...I can't think of another place that's comparable which is why Barrio deserves 5 stars.   Recommend getting here before happy hour on the weekends b/c it can get very crowded. Half price margs and draft beers from 5 - 7. Margs are dangerously good and lots of micro brews to chose from.   Build your own tacos which gives you options. The Coca Cola Marinated Steak is the bomb and so is the pulled pork and chorizo. Tons of toppings and delicious sauces to choose from. I have had almost every variety of taco you can think of and I haven't had one bad meal. My fav spot to meet up with friends in the Lakewood area!!!!"}
{"text":"So we sit, and ten minutes minutes later, three young guys sit. We order drinks, they're ok. Nothing special. We put down the taco order. She ignores it. The three guys next to us get chips. We never get any.   Our taco order still sits there. She takes these other orders. Our still sit here. Still no food and three guys already ate and got their checks."}
{"text":"Was a huge fan of the other locations and now we have our own in dtw! The prices are good, food is fresh and lots of different options. Green goddess and stoner shells are must haves. I love the margarita with the Chile powder rim. There has been quite a wait to get in even on weeknights, that is the only downside."}
{"text":"We ate here on Thursday eve, 8:00pm. It was crowded but we were seated without a wait, three of us. It is loud, music is blaring and a lot of crowd noise. We had to shout at our table to have any kind of conversation. I ordered a blood orange margarita which was good. Service was quick and our waitress was friendly. The two tacos I ordered were good although cold, which I guess is how they're served.   To sum up, I would say the food and drinks are good and well priced. It is geared to a younger crowd. Saturday or Sunday brunch might be a quieter experience. Otherwise expect to do a lot of shouting."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and this place was a great choice for lunch. Fast service and really tasty tacos. Really like the El Filadelfia steak taco. Nicely done!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! EVERYTHING on their menu is delicious. I usually make my own tacos with tofu and a crunchy shell. They also serve brunch - omg their cinnamon french toast and shrimp and grits are mouth watering. Plus the prices are so cheap! I go every chance I get."}
{"text":"Wow. I wasn't sure about trying this place since I'm a Texan who loves her Tex Mex and tacos. If you're familiar with Torchy's then this is your place. You order off a printed menu with pencils at the table. It was crowded as we went before an Indians vs Astros game. Great service. The Paloma margarita was really good and refreshing. It's very close to Quicken Arena for Cavs games too. Order the trio of appetizers. The pic shows pineapple salsa, traditional guacamole and queso with chorizo."}
{"text":"Very good, build your own tacos. Margaritas are fabulous!  Guac, what can i say??  I'm not into guacamole dip like my husband, but here, it is AWESOME and you get a real serving!!!  Queso & salsa are fabulous!! Staff is great and answer any questions, even though it's pretty self explanatory with your pencils and forms on the table. Definitely coming back on our next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Wednesday is happy hour. $3 margaritas and discounts on tacos until midnight. Get here!"}
{"text":"Barrio is great for a reasonably priced, delicious meal! Start by having one of their fun margaritas paired with their interesting guacamole choices. I almost always get the seasonal/special guac and I have never been let down.   Next you choose from a list of different shells, meats, cheeses, fillings and sauces so the options are just about endless. My recommendation: Get the Green goddess shell or the stoner shell, you won't be sorry. The green goddess is filled with guac and queso and the stoner shell is filled with chorizo and queso, YUM! Some of their sauces are spicy which I love but make sure you look or you may be drinking more margaritas than you planned (which is also fine). Their secret sauce is a must! If you don't feel like being creative or the other list just scares you (I've been there), they have a pre-planned list of tacos too.   Great happy hour in the bar until 7, $3 Margaritas!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of our top three favorite places to go in cleveland. Taco selection is awesome and for brunch they will have breakfast tacos as well. We have had the dip trio and may favorite was the guac. Also drinks are a little expensive for my taste (typical tremont pricing) but they were worth it! We keep coming back and I hear they also have a downtown location now."}
{"text":"I will just never understand the Barrio hype. The food is average. It's the most American Mexican food you can possibly create (most of the ingredients are probably purchased at Gordon Food Service). It's not bad food...its just not good. It is simply average. Certainly never worth an hour wait.   Another point - they don't have simple soft corn tortillas...??! If you want a real taco, go to La Plaza.   On a positive note, I am very happy to see a thriving local business and the margaritas are decent."}
{"text":"A little expensive for slightly above average tacos. I guess I enjoy the simple taste of Taco Bell. Don't get me wrong the food was good. I feel the upside to this place is the following of hipsters it has. The menu layout was different and cool."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with friends! Had an extremely positive experience. Servers seemed tired, but continually refilled cups of water and chips and salsa.  The breakfast tacos were large. 3 were enough to fill you up. I got the crab cake, chorizo hash, and chimi churri. The crab cake and slaw were my favorite of the 3, but all were good.  Got a blood orange mimosa, but wouldn't recommend it. It's mixed with cider, not champagne, and the drink felt heavy for brunch."}
{"text":"Great deal for amazing tacos. $3 each and you get to build a fantastic taco.  Worth the upgrade to make your tortilla a green goddess (soft taco plus hard taco plus queso plus grac - only $1!  Their house made chorizo is to die for.  Also for appetizers order the cheese and chorizo dip - you won't be sorry!  The jicama slaw is also a great add on to the tacos and for no extra they let you add one or more of their variety of sauces like chipotle crema, guajillo sauce, cilantro pesto and cilantro/lime aioli amongs many others.  I will tell you that my fave combo is the green goddess taco with pulled portk, rice, middlefield smoked cheddar, jicama slaw, with salsa verde and cilantro pesto sauce.  YUM!  Great funky athmosphere and drinks at the bar were yummy too."}
{"text":"I love barrio! Probably my favorite place to eat ever! The staff is so friendly too. There is always quick service. The only complaint is how crowded it gets and how little room is in the restaurant. It gets crammed at dinner time. Other than that it's fantastic!!"}
{"text":"This place is off the chart amazing!!!!! I ordered the vegan stoner and the dirty taco! Both were amazing and I would definitely order both of them again. The tacos were $4 each or $3 for the build your own. The stoner quest was the best quest I have ever had! So good! Also, the environment is super chill and super fun. Overall, I loved this place and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Barrio is a great place to go when you want tacos and margaritas and don't want to spend to much money. The Lakewood location is my favorite one to go to! Their queso is always hot and melted, their chips are always fresh and their tacos are the best. The atmosphere is always great. It's my go to place when I'm hungry!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a date, cocktail hour, or to take out of town guests.  I've been here countless times and it has yet to disappoint.  Word to the wise - happy hour is JUST in the bar area - so if you want to take advantage of 1/2 price margaritas and $2 tacos... get a space in the front.  All of the staff have always been professional, quick, and pleasant.  The service is not extraordinary, but it also does not lack. Always ask about the \"special\" taco of the month... often it's pretty delicious!    Onto the food... the elote dip (corn and cheese) is to die for.  IT is the best item on their menu... and it always disappears from the table quickly.  The margaritas are pretty tasty, but at $8 a piece they seem expensive (especially when you you don't \"feel\" it after a few of them).  Onto the tacos... they are \"build your own\" via Happy Dog style.   Mine have always come out well, I have not experienced the \"soggy\" tacos that other people have written about.  This is a great place to hang out.  It's not going to \"knock your socks off\" - but you are going to have an awesome time and some good food for a very reasonable price.  Their patio is one of my favorite places to spend an evening..."}
{"text":"We absolutely love barrio and frequently come here for our taco fix. However, recently we had such a great customer service experience, I wanted to add another review. First, the food.  The guac is always on point. Their rotating specials (both food and drink) are always awesome. And the tacos.... the tacos are awesome and customizable to whatever you like or don't like.  The customer service is also awesome. Despite the fact that they are always busy, they really try to get to everyone as quick as possible. Recently, my fiancé and I were eating there and the bartender overheard  us say we are recently engaged and she just couldn't have been nicer. She celebrated with us and made the whole experience that much more fun. Love Barrio!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a tequila crawl with come friends.  Tequila selection was ok, not a lot of knowledge from our server which i found odd.  Overall the tacos were just ok, I feel like they were just thrown together and overpriced, just not blown away.  The weirdest thing though was the murals on the wall, it was dark and dank and really kind of depressing, not where I want to be for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! I am specifically reviewing the truck. We had one visit us at work, courtesy of or very kind owner. The menu was limited but amazing. The offered the soft tacos with chorizo, chicken or black beans. I had a black bean and chicken. I liked both very much. I think the black bean was my favorite. Mild, filled with great flavors, it was a real winner.  The chips and guacamole were great, but a little on the salty side. I prefer my guac with a good lime punch, but this was very good.  The gents running the truck today were gracious and friendly and probably in shock that a large group of mostly women could pound down so many tacos!  Bravo Barrio! I can't wait to visit the new location on Fairmount."}
{"text":"I love barrio...All of the locations!  Cedar Fairmount Pros: I live closest to this branch and it's in a great location. There's parking in the back, outside seating options (but not as good as the Tremont location).   Downtown Pros: .... it's near everything downtown.   Tremont Pros: The patio is so cute and nice. I would go to this branch if you want to eat outside.   The wait times for all of the branches are very similar.   Food is AMAZING! Price is awesome. Free chips and salsa. I recommend getting the queso too. Even though the queso can be pricey, if you split amongst a big group, it's so worth the price!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Barrio. Love. This was my first visit to the Tremont location. The patio is amazing and the staff could not have been nicer. I ordered the special of the month taco which was a barbecue chicken. It was not good. Thankfully I'd ordered a backup, my own creation (stoner, braised beef, chihuahua, jicama slaw, salsa verde, honey chipotle sauce) and it was awesome! I also ordered the cocktail special called The Dog Days: Jameson, cold brew and molasses bitters. So nice, I did it twice. Despite being really disappointed by the taco special, Barrio is still my favorite taco in the Land. I'll be back asap. PS: loved that the patio is dog friendly! It really adds to the community vibe."}
{"text":"Our server was kind. The food was what was lacking. The guacamole tastes like the store bought stuff you get in plastic packages. The house marg is an average marg that's definitely made with pre-made artificially flavored mix. Also, they're not very strong because after my third marg all I was feeling was nauseous from all the sugar. My tacos were cold and soggy when I got them and maybe if the margs were stronger I would have been able to take more than a bite without being grossed out."}
{"text":"Everyone will be happy at Barrio- pretty bold statement, I know, but there's literally a taco combo to please the whole group. My family was in Cleveland for two nights and I made sure that this was a place they made it to. Both my vegetarian self and meat loving father could get tacos we were both crazy about, plus the fun/novelty of getting to check off your toppings on a paper notepad is great.  And oh how the tortilla chips overfloweth. The salsa  (and especially chips) alone are enough to warrant coming here. Queso isn't necessary but it's dang good too. Then add a house marg and I'm pretty sure I'm in some sort of heaven. (And we haven't even gotten to the tacos yet!) Like I said, enough options to please everyone- including vegans! Tofu is amaze, so is the crackhead sauce, and slaw.  I've been to this location twice and ambiance also is quirky fun. Nice big window, great bar, outdoor seating. Service super duper friendly. Drink options = also tons.  So overall, I'm kind of echoing the hype, but believe it. (Or maybe I'm just craving tacos... nope, definitely just a really good and fun restaurant.)"}
{"text":"I spend more money here than I do for rent in Tremont!! Mainly because is absolutely delicious, the staff is great, and you just can't get enough. Moving within walking distance to this place was the best thing I did in 2014. Great Drinks, amazing tacos, Monthly specials, and an incredible happy hour. Need I say more?  One of these days I'll get the recipe for the Barrio secret sauce..."}
{"text":"I take all of my friends to barrio when they visit and everyone loves it! The green goddess is my favorite. The queso, salsa, and guac are all amazing too. They have a wide selection of margarita flavors. The only bad thing is that there is normally a wait."}
{"text":"Came here after and Indians game. Although the crowd is awesome...these are the worst tacos I've ever had in my life. Food as terrible."}
{"text":"As a Native Texan living in Ohio, I am a little bit of a taco snob. But I think I've finally found a taco place that reminds me of home. The simplicity is there, the flavors are there, the margaritas are there, the price is right, therefore, I am there! The secret taco sauce is great on just about anything. My boyfriend raved about the pulled pork. This probably going to end up on my Cleveland's Best Taco list.   The only downfall of this place is that they are only open for lunch on the weekends. With the downtown location, they should really be taking advantage of the lunch crowd during the week. If they were open, my co-workers and I would probably go there more often since we are right down the street.  My advice: If you are not that hungry, only get one taco. You will save money and you know you're going to fill up on chips anyway. And try the secret taco sauce!"}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new Barrio Location in Willoughby. Overall not a good experience compared to the other locations. A group of 3 arrived around 4:50 pm was told 30-45mins. Not a big deal for the happy hour seating. However the problem was, my group was blatantly skip for some odd reason. Similar groups of three's who walked in well over 20-30 mins after us were seated. Larger groups walked in and were seated as well for both happy hour and regular dining. After an hour and 10 minutes someone finally tries to seat us. At this point we have waited out for ppl to leave the bar to seat ourselves. I don't really know what the deal was or why we weren't seated but it looked as we just didn't exist to the hostesses. Needless to say if I want my barrio fix, I'd probably go to the other locations like I have before."}
{"text":"Wow went here on a Sunday after church. I'd heard amazing things about them but figured there was no way they could top Bakersfield.   Different and wonderful in their own rite. We had the brunch chicken & waffle taco with super thick flavorful bacon on it. I had a bowl. Loved the way the order forms are on the table, I went check happy marking off some of everything.   Atmosphere was great and that Cleveland Heights will be the go to spot on a warm sunny day. Margaritas have one or two."}
{"text":"The ambience is good. We had cranberry margarita's and they were also good.  The tacos were so so but I am used to tacos from a taco truck in NorCal and Mexico so I'm a bit biased!  Overall, it's worth a stop since its location is a block from Quicken Loans arena in downtown Cleveland"}
{"text":"I've had good experiences at this Barrio location before but the last time I was here, it was awful. The waitress was so rude! I will never waste my lunch hour to pick up an order again! I left there disliking the waitress so much that I don't plan on going to the Tremont location again. She looked familiar, like another waitress from the downtown location. I'm not sure if they can move between the locations as needed or what, but if she is the same person than she was terrible at the downtown location too."}
{"text":"I really do love Barrio.  Good Tacos with a nice level of diversity of flavor and content, good service and the bar area is stocked with some of the finest stuff around. I also love their \"brunch tacos\" (I got a chicken and waffle, which was more chicken than waffle, but not bad.)   Parking is mostly street, and if you're going to get there, do so early as seating is ALWAYS at a premium, but over all, a nice place to visit for tasty tacos, good conversation, and a libation or two.   So, for Tacos of delight, make mine BARRIO!"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp and thought we'd walk in for a late lunch at 2:00pm Saturday. Wrong...40 min wait! But we eventually found a seat at the bar and had a house Margarita ($6) and Bloody Mary ($5) which were basic but good. Once seated, we Ordered the queso appetizer (average) and 4 tacos. Two premade, two build your own. All were great even though the build your own choices are overwhelming. The double shells (like Green Goddess) really set the tacos apart. Great prices too, $3-5 per taco."}
{"text":"Very tasty and huge tacos here. You can build your own with tons of options for protein, vegetables, toppings, sauces, cheese etc. They can get a bit bulky if you go crazy on the options. 2 filled tacos here are very filling. Beware of the reaper sauce. Plenty of bars nearby to pop over for a drink while you wait for a table. Definitely want to explore more toppings here next time."}
{"text":"I live about an hour away from the closest Barrio but the food is so good I make the drive a couple times a month. I always have great service from the servers. Most recently I had Kris from the Lakewood location as my server and he was so friendly and prompt. But the last 3 times I have been in the wait was really long so we ordered drinks while we waited. Every time I have received extremely terrible service at the bar. I understand they are very busy but the attitude Brenden gave me was out of hand. The first time he yelled at my for standing in the way and I was understanding so I moved over and he wouldn't take my order until I moved. He couldn't just politely told me I was in the servers way but instead he handled it by being rude and refusing to take my order until I stood in the right spot...... No I didn't complain then, I let it go. But I came in again tonight and received poor service again from the same guy so I felt the need to report this. I have seen multiple bad reviews on the same person so I know it's not just me. Brendan is extremely rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"I'd seen a few bad reviews online (slow service) and wanted to try Barrio out myself.  The concept of serving tacos Happy Dog-style seems like it would be confusing, and to be honest, the menu was a little confusing for a first-timer.  Unlike Happy Dog, the mixing and matching affects just about every level of your taco - from what type of taco (soft, hard, corn, flour), to what filling (chorizo, beef, chicken, fish, veggie, etc.), to salsas, sauces, cheeses.  The choices are pretty overwhelming, and I think that after you get over the initial confusion, it's what makes Barrio unique.  We tried the chorizo, and fish, and they were absolutely delicious.  The meal was also served with complimentary chips and salsa.  I appreciated that the salsa was spicy and flavorful, and not some watered down tomatoey goop.  The margaritas weren't spectacular (ie from a mix and super sweet), but they did the job.  We also ordered guacamole which came with even more chips.  We sat on their patio, which is pretty big and I think they could add some more tables.  The service was attentive, but not pushy, and we had no problems at all with the service being slow.  It has more of a dive-y feel than 806 Wine bar did, and I think it's somewhere I'd like to linger over drinks (as we did the other night) and continue to stuff our faces with chips and drinks.  Overall, I had a great experience and am looking forward to my next tacos there."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Open late! Highly recommend the taco shells that are soft on outside with a hard shell inside. Not like those small boutique tacos - they are a good size and queso is great!"}
{"text":"Came here after a game one night. The place was busy and it was my first time. I liked how you ordered on a piece of paper and could make your own tacos. The server kept the chips and salsa coming which was nice because we were eating them so fast. The tacos came out so quickly and were AMAZING! Highly recommend, super affordable too."}
{"text":"Pretty sure my credit card got stolen here. And it was way to freakin loud. Seriously sounded like a concert in there. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life. Queso was not hot the cilantro pesto was nasty.everthing was served Luke warm and the lemonade was watery"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. 2 $3 tacos are a substantial meal for one person. I love the choices available on the build your own tacos. Ingredients are very fresh and interesting like pulled pork and smoked cheeses. There are also substantial vegetarian and vegan options for those who like such things"}
{"text":"Sure it takes a couple of trips here to perfect your ordering, but once you do, this might have the best price-to-quality ratio in Cleveland, if not all of Ohio. All the ingredients always seem vibrantly fresh and the various sauces and salsas are correctly mixed and seasoned. And I'm betting the tacos on the menu are equally well thought-out though I've always done the create-your-own tacos (which I initially regretted). Our most recent trip here was on Sunday and I had two of my now-perfected taco -- pulled pork (double meat) with Middlefield Cheddar and red cabbage with chipotle crema poured over it on a soft flour tortilla. I also usually check out the fish of the day taco and lucky me, it happened to be Grouper. The pulled pork tacos were $5 each due to the double meat while the grouper was the standard $3. That's right -- I had a load of pulled pork and a high-end fish for $13 (plus a nonstop supply of chips and salsa).  Now, sure, you have to pay for the margaritas ($6 to $9) or other alcoholic beverages, but the drinks aren't watered down and your final bill still isn't going to be painful. As you can imagine, this place always seems to be busy and the seating is cramped inside so it can be a bit noisy but it has a kind of festive atmosphere. In the warmer months you can choose between the huge outdoor patio or the the wall-to-wall Day of the Day artwork on the interior walls."}
{"text":"I'm from Southern California and didn't have too much of an expectation when finding Mexican food in Ohio. We stopped in after an Indians game and I was pleasantly surprised. You are able to create your own tacos, so it's all about what you choose. However, the ingredients were fresh and service was good so that helped. I had the best shrimp tacos at this place, so much in fact that I ordered more before I was done with what I had. I would recommend this place, especially since it's so close to the stadiums it's an easy stop."}
{"text":"I really would love to give Barrio more stars, but I can't bring myself to actually do it. I've been here 3 times - I'm 1 for 3. My first experience (last year) was terrific, but I haven't had a great experience since. I keep TRYING to love this place, I really do.   The staff has always been uber friendly and I've never had a single problem with service. The interior is interesting, hipster Mexican \"hipexican\" maybe? The drinks are pretty good, although are not very strong. The chips and salsa are hit or miss. The salsa is really good and the chips CAN be equally great, but as it usually is with home made tortilla chips, sometimes they are salty and crunchy and sometimes they are bland and chewy.   My biggest complaint with Barrio is with the tacos. If I were to describe the tacos in one word it would be \"wet\" - if I were to describe them in two words they would be \"cold\"  & \"wet.\" Salivating yet? They do have a few salsa options, but I don't think they strain the salsas at all, leaving your taco literally dripping salsa water and leaving a nice pale cloudy pool of wetness at the bottom of your tray (yak). I prefer hard shell tacos and it's really unappetizing to have to set your hard shell in a puddle in between bites. The shells get (I apologize for using this next word) moist and start to break apart. If you are not a fast eater, it's a serious shit show by the time you are nearing the end of your taco. Now, I understand everyone doesn't prefer hard shell, but my fiance had the same complaint about his soft shells being too juicy. (blurp)  I would also like to point out that their inability to make a decision on the \"fish\" tacos is a detriment to their restaurant. When I first went to Barrio I believe they had a grilled shrimp which was excellent. Shortly after I went back to indulge, but when I was given my tacos I send them back because I thought they had brought me the wrong order. I was then informed that their \"fish\" option changes and that what they served me was, in fact, the day's fish taco - it was WALLEYE. I'm a Midwest girl. I love walleye, but not on a taco! I hadn't \"dressed\" my taco accordingly, although I'm not even sure how I would've done that. Gross. I had no idea that the fish option changed. I recently had shrimp ceviche, which was also terrible. Again, cold and dripping with shrimp & onion water. No thanks.   If you're feeling up for an adventure - go for it. I know that some people LOVE this place and I get it. I just don't think my personal tastes are on track with what they offer. Maybe I should just stick with traditional beef, lettuce, sour cream and cheese... Maybe it really is safest inside the box.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"Was recommended this place by a few people. I just moved to town and live nearby, so I came here for an impromptu taco date. Cleveland Heights currently has a lot of construction going on, so the \"sidewalk\" in front of the restaurant is a series of plywood boards, but that's hardly their fault.  On a busy Friday night, the wait was only about 20 min for two people (\"waiting\" invokes standing outside on the plywood, awkwardly staring at hungry people). Once inside, you fill out a checklist for tacos (like at a sushi place) and I was pleasantly surprised to see a number of vegetarian options. The tofu was especially delicious--crispy and well-flavored--and the portobellos were also lovely (not at all bland and complemented well by the other flavor options for sauces and salsas).  There did seem to be some confusion with the order (one of my date's tacos had beef when he ordered tofu, but he didn't care enough to tell the waiter and he said it was still delicious).  Other caveat is that the staff seemed rushed, which is to be expected on a busy night. Food came quickly, as did the check. The waiter was pretty eager to shuffle people through and actually tried to take the bill back before we'd paid. I'd definitely go back, but I might go at a less busy time or grab takeout instead to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"My buddies and I just got done working out an are always looking for new places to try out.  My experience started out great, friendly people for sure. After we got sat our server then began to explain how the ordering process worked. I go circling away at what I thought was going to be a scrumptious meal. I get my food. Boy was I DEVASTATED. I asked for 3 bowls of food instead of 3 tacos. My food came in little salsa containers (bowls) you would receive as an appetizer from a Mexican restaurant. I ordered double chicken on all my bowls. Boy was I lucky to inherit crumbs on a good day. Food was very plain and had no taste. Here's the kicker. I receive my bill. It came to $32. $32 for 3 tacos. I thought there had to be some sort of a mistake. The server than showed me my card I ordered from. I got charged the base price of what already came on the tacos PLUS *Charged $2 per taco to replace in a bowl. (Even though I'm saving them food cost by not eating their tortillas) *$2.25 per taco to get extra meat ON TOP OF WHAT YOURE ALREADY PAYING FOR YOUR ORIGINAL MEAT (when I didn't get any meat in the first place) *0.50-$1 per topping you want to add via. Sour cream, tomatoes, Sauce.  Great place to hangout Just don't go there when you're hungry"}
{"text":"This is going to be bad. With my move to Tremont happening in December I have a feeling I am going to be stopping in here a lot!   We headed up on a Friday night and tried to hit happy hour for $2 tacos but we did miss it. That doesn't get us down since normally they are $3 so still an awesome deal.   This place isn't that large and on a Friday night it definitely was packed and even though he told us a 20 minute wait and it was more like 40, we still had a wonderful time. We ordered some drinks at the bar which were delicious and when we were finally sat we were ready to eat!   The tacos here are SO good, like I am craving them good and want to go RIGHT NOW. I ordered 2, one of them being the stoner taco mmm mmm mmm! Def. get that, its amazing!   At this price skip taco bell and come here! It's SO good."}
{"text":"THE BEST margaritas! If anyone says they have better, please let me know! Tacos could have been better though. They were a little bland and it was like i was biting into cardboard at times. Fun atmosphere, very high energy."}
{"text":"Just give me a half gallon of their queso blanco, a few of these incredible tacos, and don't watch me eat it. It's for your own good."}
{"text":"Great tacos, love the build your own style of ordering. A little bothered that you need to pay extra for a second protein (I like beans AND meat) which really adds up if you're getting multiple tacos."}
{"text":"If you're planning to come for happy hour or before a game plan ahead. Amazing margaritas and build your own tacos. I love the stoner shell. You can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. If you question a sauce ask for a few on the side. Free chips and salsa make this joint near E4 a no brainer."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like tacos! I've had tacos in so many different bars, malls, restaurants, in different cities and states & countries! this on being in my hometown I was looking forward to but was disappointed fu fu tacos with a fu fu price$$$. Will not be returning for a fourth time."}
{"text":"steaming Cleveland summer day and I have a taste for taco and margarita. oh yeah buddy. I like my instincts when I visit a restaurant with an idea of when a rush of people and wait time is to come. I seemingly always miss the crowd which is good by me because I am not one for crowds of hungry, drunk people.  I'm sorry to disappoint, place is not all that creative. Bartenders, wait staff somewhat aloof, feigning urban maladroit boredom. Nothing to be very stoked for even for a Saturday night. Trace elements of Melt and Happy Dog. What is with stupid kitsch fetish and these places? Some kind of misappropriated sloppy bohemian aesthetic that makes the kids dumber and the surburbanites ready for 'try something different'. People in Cleveland seem to love this though. That is okay, do your thing. There is also Taco Bell, gas station, and CVS in short walking distance. Only place in Cleveland that I've visited that has aesthetic well is Palookaville, read previous review if you like..  Chips and salsa, meh. Tacos were good enough. I was definitely full on two tacos and two margueritas. I enjoyed view of several people trying to open locked door on bar side of restaurant as the crowd backed up. pick up the tab hardly any butterflies leaving my wallet. cheers."}
{"text":"Sorry, long review but I was actually skeptical about Barrio before I tried it! Everyone had recommended it but I wasn't entirely convinced that it'd be worth it being from California. Boy was I wrong. But I was probably sold when I was introduced to the Tres Amigos. I mean, who can resist trying unique twists on guacamole? It also helps that I can order two $3 build your own tacos and be completely satisfied. They also give you tortilla chips and salsa, of course.   I love the fact that you can customize your order. (Also hate it because you can sometimes miss the taste factor if you get the wrong combination of ingredients). It's also overwhelming because I LOVE sauces and immediately want to add them all. Luckily, I was with seasoned Barrio customers and they called me off my impending saucy (and probably soggy) taco.   Can we also talk about the guacamole!? This just tugs at my California girl heart. My favorite is the Tuscan guac. Something about the sweet balsamic sauce mixed with the basil on the salty tortilla chip just hits the spot. They also have the pineapple guac but it doesn't surpass the Tuscan one for me. Especially when the chunks of pineapple get scooped out of the bowl and accidentally fall on the table. The smoked salmon special was also great when they had it, though a little salty. The new special as of March is the cauliflower leek guac. Honestly, I don't think the cauliflower goes well with the guac - it gives it a sort of a smelly vegetable taste? (If that's a thing). The fried leeks on top were a nice touch but didn't add to the guac at all, and overall, it just tasted like salty avocados. They've always been so great about us asking to split the Tres Amigos between our group of three to four usually.   I've been to the Tremont and the one in downtown Cleveland. If it's cold and you're coming during peak hours, you probably don't want to go to the Tremont one because you might be huddled by the door, or if you don't like to be pushed and feel like you're in the way, we stood outside while we waited. At least the one in downtown has a bigger waiting area, plus the arcade area has some tables and chairs. We took our buzzer there for a few minutes to get out of the way and then went back when we felt like we might be called. Not sure if the buzzer reaches there, but the area is right next to Barrio if you want to take a chance. Or, if you find space at the bar, you can get your drink on.   They just added a few new things to the menu! I had to try the garlic cream shrimp - AMAZING. They also added a few new sauces."}
{"text":"Need a way to get me out of bed? Just say \"Barrio?\" and I'm in! The Cleveland Heights location was just the best thing to come to the Cedar Fairmount area. You can make your meal as cheap as possible with their $3 basic tacos. Or, spice it up with that Green Goddess goodness, which is $1 extra. (California girl in me is a little biased to guac on/in everything). They have one menu where you can customize your tacos - it took me about 3 visits to pin down *the one*. Or, if you aren't as adventurous (c'mon...), they do have another menu with tacos that you can just order.   My favorite is the Green Goddess with the Shrimp with Garlic Cream and mango habanero and the toppings depends on how I feel that night. They have monthly specials that get pretty creative... They can be a hit or a miss honestly, but I usually am willing to try it. If you're like me, I usually am eagerly watching out for their post on social media for the guac of the month. They'll have a unique taco, queso, guac, and two drink choices for the month on a separate menu. I usually like to get the \"Tres Amigos\" and get the special queso, special guac, and the Tuscan guac (my fave). This way, I can try the special queso and guac in smaller portions, without having to share :P.   If you want some dessert, they don't have churros unfortunately, but they do have chocotacos (vanilla or cayenne). They mix cayenne pepper in the vanilla ice cream for the latter. If you're afraid of it being spicy, I don't think it is - though I have a high tolerance for spice. It doesn't change the flavor so I'd recommend it. It can easily be shared by two, since they cut it in half.   I'm personally not a fan of tequila drinks, but I do love their raspberry marg with the cayenne sugar rim.   I usually come during the late night happy hour from 9 - 11 PM on weekdays (someone double check me on that but I know they usually advertise their 4 - 7 PM happy hour on weekdays as well). This discount only works IF YOU SIT IN THE BAR AREA. They discount $1 on tacos, $1 off drafts, and half off margaritas - but you can get a flavored marg for $1 more, or upgrade to a top shelf margarita for $1 extra. Or both! This is usually when I'll \"splurge\" and get the Green Goddess taco with the Coca-Cola marinated steak, both of which are $1 extra. But, there's the $1 discount during happy hour, so it makes me feel better about it. Barrio usually isn't as packed during the late night hours, so I've never had a problem getting a table within 5 minutes.   I frequent their weekend brunch as well. I love me some chicken and waffle taco *drool* - but it is not for everyone. I like the bitterness of the collard greens contrasted with the sweet maple syrup on the waffle crusted chicken and strips of bacon. I'd recommend the French Toast bowl and the Biscuits and Gravy bowl, as they seem to be well-received by everyone that I've persuaded to join me for brunch there. They also serve mimosas during brunch, so win-win.   Now the gripes..  * Be warned that if you try to come during peak dining hours that you will likely have a wait. If you have a group larger than 6, that wait can be long. You have the option of hanging out at the bar, but the place is so small and everyone crowds inside if it is too hot or too cold outside. They do have a small outdoor patio in the back, which is nice when the weather is nice.  * Because of the nature of the custom tacos, it is very easy to find yourself with a taco isn't what you ordered. Please do me a favor - check your tacos (they will check your ticket) and if something is off, tell the waiter/waittress - they're very receptive to getting you the right taco. Don't be a dick. If you're hangry, just eat more of the chips and salsa and save your complaining.  * Barrio isn't really \"authentic\" Mexican food so it bothers me when people try to knock it down for that. Go somewhere else then.  * The Cleveland Heights location closes at 1 AM, so all alcohol has to be consumed by midnight. Just be warned..we had to finish off a pitcher because we didn't know this. The waitress was nice about letting us know about that - they'll take your drinks away if you don't finish it, I think.. * Parking around this area is tricky during peak hours. There are metered parking lots up Grandview and next to Nighttown, down the street - so carpool when you can and bring quarters."}
{"text":"I know, you Yelpers love your Barrio, but today I was underwhelmed and unimpressed.  Today I thought I'd take my mom out for lunch for Mexican.  My mom could eat Mexican food everyday so I was hoping she and I would have found a new, fun place to eat.  We came toward the tail end of brunch and were seated fairly quickly.  Brunch occurs on Sat & Sunday until 3pm.  You can get the regular menu during brunch too.  Basically brunch is more \"breakfast\"-inspired tacos.  I was excited for the brunchy tacos & they all sounded delish.  I ordered two tacos (one brunchy, one not), my mom ordered two tacos.  I also ordered the guac of the day special and a mojito.  The service was good & quick.  The guac came out & the toppings on the guac was wonderful, the guac itself....not so much.  It seriously tasted like the pre-packaged del monte guac you can buy in the store.  When I asked if the quac was fresh & made in house, I was told yes.  I question this or wonder if they're putting a preservative in it to keep it from browning.  The flavor profile was so off-putting to me, I couldn't eat it.  At $8 it wasn't a cheap mistake either.  The tacos came out quickly.  I was excited to taste the breakfasty taco first and when I bit into it I got a mouthful of white rice and no flavor.  What a disappointment.  White rice?  Really?  Come-on Barrio.  Add some seasoning or something but a white rice burrito with a small scrambled egg and a couple of black beans does not a taco make.  Not even with the $1 avocado added did it taste good.  All sides were approximately $1 and I'm not sure that price was worth it either.  They've got to be making a killing on the sour cream and beans alone.  Taco #2 was a crisp taco shell, but aside from the meat tasting very-well seasoned, was un-inspired too.  Mom didn't mind her taco and took the 2nd one home.    Baririo, I'm just not thrilled.  For what I paid, I feel I got raped for a bland, boring, and mediocre product.  Would I go back, maybe, if someone wanted to, but I certainly wouldn't suggest it.    On a service note, our server was sweet, attentive (for the most part).  Service was quick.    Be prepared to eat with plastic sporks and over cardboard carryout containers.  You might feel like you're at a taco truck (where Barrio perhaps should have stayed.),    Go if you must.  I shall say I warned you though."}
{"text":"Pros: Good tacos once you find out what combinations work. Good drinks and beer list. Reasonable prices.   Cons: The standard house salsa and guac are terrible.  Seriously,  how has someone else not mentioned this and how does a taco joint mess these items up? The salsa is always too tart/citrusy and lacks cilantro. The guac also lack cilantro or much other flavor at all. Maybe the other flavors are better?   Service is not always great but better the last few times. Not had a problem with cold food or missing ingredients."}
{"text":"What a great happy hour!  Mon.-Fri. 4-7 at the bar area, half off margaritas and $1 off tacos (excluding the monthly flavors).  They have other deals too, but these ones are the ones that speak to me.  I'm not really all that good at creating my own tacos so I usually go with one of the recommendations.  I am a total fan of the pineapple jalapeno margarita.  If you've never had one, it's a must, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"Take this place for what it is... The best taco joint around. It's simple, I can't eat there every day but its fun and inexpensive. Just use the taco chit wisely (don't add a ton of things to your taco) The crew who works there is great once you get to know them. Always try the specials, I've never been dissatisfied. Barrio has a great happy hour as well, I must say Wednesday is my favorite where whiskey, bourbon and scotch are all half off until 7pm! Great little place."}
{"text":"So effing good. Super cheap too. Did the build your own tacos, pulled pork was so good! Fun atmosphere and good service"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Exterior of the food containers were dirty, with dried food stuck to it. Food is good here. Dirty taco is great."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, this place might look like and feel like barrio(which is a stretch). But it is not. Go to either Cleveland or Lakewood to actually experience a real barrio. This is a sad excuse. Anyone that rates higher than 2 start has ever been to either."}
{"text":"we were excited to bring an out of state artist here for brunch. unfortunately we had a terrible experience. the waiter greeted us with 'wow you guys smell like loud pack' and 'hope you get home safe'. excuse me? what kind of customer service/experience is this? we are paying for drinks and food at your establishment, yet are confronted with an immature staff, leading to an underwhelming experience. not only was our food served room temperature, but the bacon/pork belly was extremely over done (barely chewable). white middle class suburbia adopting other cultures to pass as 'cultural' and 'trendy' summed up our experience. no thanks."}
{"text":"Are you serious? Can you be more consistent with your portions? The first time I came, I actually got a $4 taco with loaded ingredients. Today, I paid $8 for 2 shrimp tacos with 2 shrimps in each taco. Sad. I will not be returning to this establishment despite having good tacos."}
{"text":"Chill place with build your own tacos and a variety of margaritas. The food was pretty good, there was a nice patio out back, the atmosphere and staff were super chill. Liked it a lot!"}
{"text":"This is one of, if not the best, barrio location. Went there on a Tuesday around 5 and missed the rush, because when we left around 6:30, there was a line outside  We tried out a few new menu items including the taco shell with Queso and bacon. It was phenomena, definitely worth a try.   I got a peach margarita which tasted great but I find there isn't much alcohol in their drinks.   But my food was fresh and the service was great. A great taco spot! Also- always get the Queso!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love the Lakewood Barrio location.  I really really did.  But after Saturday's visit, I think I'll stick to other taco joints going forward.    My cousin and I dined at 6:00 pm Saturday.  I was expecting a long wait, but was surprised to see we were the only name on the wait list.  Maybe that should have been my warning sign. When our pager flashed, the hostess asked if we wanted the seat right next to the door.  Since it was a blustery Saturday, I declined and she took us to a better table on the other side of the restaurant.  Why offer the awful table if there is another vacant?  Customer service at this location isn't great.  Our waiter seemed just generally confused.  When I asked what the pescado del dia was, he stumbled over the description.  Numerous times we ran out of chips or water or drinks and had to get his attention to swing by our table.    The tipping point for me was our food.  Normally I can forgive poor customer service for outstanding food, but our tacos were delivered cold and lacking in quantity.  Again, we had to flag our server down to bring our missing taco. When I say cold, I don't meant with a hint of heat.  I mean COLD.  Did our absent minded server let these sit in the window for too long?  It wouldn't surprise me if he had.  Ignoring the temperature, the flavors and meat was spot on.    I'll give it another go because it is a convenient location and the flavors were there, but I've had a better experience at the Fired Up Taco Truck."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos. I wish the side of rice was bot plain white rice. The margaritas are good and the tacos are great. Much variety. I recommend the place to anyone. It was a cool atmosphere and the wait staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've gone to Barrio twice, once in a large group a few months ago and yesterday for Mother's Day - it was great both times. Even with it being very busy for Mother's Day and estimating a 30-40 minute wait we were seated in 15 minutes. Tacos were great and we loved the french toast bowl with bananas. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Whenever someone from out of town comes to visit- this is where I send them. PERIOD. It is the absolute best taco place in town. The margaritas are a whole bucket of goodness on their own, but their tacos are most impressive. I'm the kind of person who is always modifying food at restaurants to my perfect liking but feel guilty afterwards so this place gives the customer so much independence in creating the perfect taco. They also have suggested tacos for those who like others to make the decision, which are fabulous.   After many, many visits to both locations I have to suggest the specialty tortillas (stoner shell!!)  that come with sour cream and guacamole with crunch built in between two tortillas. The crunch and guacamole make it over the top tasty. I love the mango salsa and pulled chicken but I can say that the pesto pork is definitely unique. They are very filling and you do feel that you get your money's worth with the unlimited salsa and chips. I highly suggest the breakfast tacos they have too. The atmosphere is eclectic and fun. Go for happy hour and sit at the bar for an even better bargain. A best of Cleveland, for sure."}
{"text":"Barrio may have outgrown itself. Our most recent visit was a one hour wait for cold tacos. There is definitely a lot to be said for Barrio's atmosphere, but there are plenty of other taco places in this area  (taco tanto, el carnicero, bomba) with comparable food minus the absurd crowds."}
{"text":"This location is much larger than the others, so the wait for a table (which seems to be inevitable) is not too bad. The happy hour specials are awesome (4-6pm M-F). This is a fun place for large groups and out of town visitors. There are always new combinations to try. Plus, the chips and salsa (free!!) are awesome!! Keep it up Barrio!"}
{"text":"Tons of choices here. Never had a bad taco. Service is good. Good place if you can find a empty seat. Always packed."}
{"text":"Called 4 times kept getting put on hold and never picked back up. Employees are kind of rude. Managers are a waste of $ they actually just walk around and do nothing. The cooks are the only ones working hard. When they finally answered to take my order they said 25 mins well it actually was 45 mins to make 3 tacos lol. They need to rehire a whole new staff w the exception of the cooks. That's why I gave 2 stars cause the food tasted so good. Hire managers, servers, and hostesses that actually smile. Nobody wants to pay to see resting bitch face.    My tacos were very good. El Jeffe was delicious. I recommend Barrio, just not this location."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go to Barrio for a while because many friends have talked it up. Went to the Lakewood location because we weren't up for going into the city today. Loved the atmosphere, first of all. Sugar skull mariachi band wall mural? Count me in! Also loved the ordering style, where they have a handful of suggested tacos and then the create your own option on pencil and paper. I did two create your own, a friend did one of each, and my boyfriend did two of the suggested. We were feeling extra hungry so we did the 3 amigos of dips and had balsamic guac, pineapple salsa, and queso. I've gotta say, I'm normally a queso girl and it was quite good but the balsamic guac was to die for. That flavor combination is something I'd never try, plus it had pine nuts. It kind of seemed like too many favors from opposite ends of the spectrum to me, but the others in my party wanted to try it and I was elated we did. It was my favorite of the three. My tacos were delicious, as were the others. We also split a pitcher of the house margs on the rocks.   The tacos were well priced and a good size. Perfect to have one and chips and be content, or push it to the limits like we did and go 2, be stuffed, but not regret a savory bite of it all. Trio of dips was also well worth it. Margs were very tasty, but $24 a pitcher is a little steep in my opinion, especially given the rest of the prices being pretty spot on. The pitcher was more than half full of ice. We all got about 1 1/2 glasses full. A pitcher at most other Mexican restaurants usually runs around $16-$18 tops and I think that would be much more reasonable. Our waiter was also pretty inattentive. I asked for a water refill after my particularly spicy taco when he checked in on us and he forgot. I asked again when he returned 15 minutes later when we were done eating and he quickly dropped it off so we didn't have time to ask for the check. We then sat another 15 minutes to get it and pay. The restaurant was busy with most tables full, but not overly packed at rush hour with people waiting to be seated. But other than him being a bit more attentive and a better priced marg, we were all delighted with the experience. Would definitely recommend and am already looking forward to a return trip!"}
{"text":"I've always been a huge fan of Barrio, but lately I've been very disappointed with their restaurants. I went to the one in Tremont, and our server was wonderful, but everyone else who seemed to work was very unfriendly. When I walked in, the hostess never greeted me and I sat down with my friend who was already there. The whole time when she was answering phones she was rolling her eyes while talking to the customer. At one point she said \"6 people? We defiantly can't seat you now. Probably like an hour wait\" when the whole restaurant was empty. I thought the tacos were good, as usual, but the vibe that Barrio gave off before is just not there anymore. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"First time at the new barrio in Cleveland Hts. Great staff and helpful service! Julia was amazing. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Slippery and sloppy tacos that were pretty much impossible to eat even with the SPORK they provided. We tried a few that we \"made on our own\" with the sheets provided and then we tried a few from their specials list. None of it was really that great but if I had to choose a favorite, I'd go with the stoner shell and chorizo, lettuce and pepper contents. Still though, it was impossible to eat because of how messily made they were and how they stuffed them into a small basket to only drip all over each other.   We have much better selections here in Columbus, Ohio."}
{"text":"Sitting here eating lobster roll guac and drinking fresh watermelon magaritas. This place is amazing and you really can't go wrong. Definitely build your own! I love the speciality taco shells that they have with sour cream, chorizo and gauc. They have a beautiful patio that's open in the summer. Usually have a 30min wait on the weekends but it's worth the wait. It's a truly unique taco experience unlike anywhere else in cleveland. Definitely reccomend!"}
{"text":"If I could rate the Food and Customer Service separately here is how it would go  Food: 5 stars Because it tastes so damn good!  Food Preparation: 3 stars I'm pretty sure every time I'm there at least 1 of my tacos isn't prepared as I requested. I cant be 100% cause I've usually had 2 margaritas and I never got my sheet back :)   Customer Service : 3 stars I went in for takeout sat at the bar and asked for a water while I waited. Never got my water and half my order wasn't relayed to the kitchen. So once we figured that out. I waited some more. Still no water  This wont keep me from dining at Barrio but I just wish the service could be more consistent and maybe give back the bubble sheet with the food. Better Yet. Do you have an APP FOR THAT YET?!"}
{"text":"Make my own tacos why the heck not!! Food is great, price is great! Now to the drinks! I love the banana marg BUT there is almost always never any tequila in it! So I order myself an extra shot! Maybe one day I won't have to."}
{"text":"Few times in life where meals are so artfully crafted, because here I made my own taco."}
{"text":"Barrio has the best mix of tacos and margaritas. The lakewood location has an amazing atmosphere and in the summer they open the ceiling to floor doors to get that lovely breeze. The salsa and home made chips are fantastic, although I wish they would give you more right away because it is so good. I love that you get to pick exactly what goes on the tacos, mixing and matching items until you get the perfect combination.  The monthly specials are always amazing, stop by in the summer for watermelon guacamole and margaritas. Speaking of margaritas... Barrio has the best in Cleveland. End of story, perfect every time."}
{"text":"I was visiting the city from Seattle and I LOVED this place!!! (partially because the area and atmosphere reminded me so much of the swank bars in Seattle) Our waitress was great, super friendly and helpful as we told her we were first timers. The build your own tacos were delicious and the Jackarita was perfect! I also got a margarita but it was pretty weak. Overall though, love this place. Would recommend for date night or night out with the girls."}
{"text":"Friggin fantastic. Totally worth the hassle of parking in downtown Cleveland. Went in just hoping to get some good chips and Queso dip and instead ended up having some of the BEST chips and dip (and salsa!) we've ever had! And this is coming from someone who lived in Tucson AZ for a year, and takes pride in how many different Mexican restaurants I've tried!   The chips are similar to chipotle where they are slightly smaller than usual, but thicker and nice and salty. The salsa was flavorful and fresh tasting. They had four kinds of cheese dip and we only tried one - and it was splendid.  I usually get Fajitas when I go to Mexican joints, but this place pretty much only has tacos. I was disappointed at first - but then when I designed my own tacos (by choosing from a generous list of potential ingredients on a note card sitting at the table), I was blown away. I order soft tacos with chicken and a bunch of other goodies inside and they were better than any fajitas I could have ordered. They hit the spot flawlessly. I could have eaten a dozen of them! But alas, I filled up on chips and could only eat 2 and a half =|  Lastly, service was great. Our waitress never let the chips run out, and refilled my water at least 6 times (I drink a lot of water at Mexican joints).   So yeah, well done. This is one of the few five stars I have ever left on Yelp, and this place definitely deserves that honor!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best taco place in the world. Happy hour is the best! Try the pomegranate margarita & the queso!!"}
{"text":"Tacos were okay, not very authentic.  Flour tortillas?  WTF.  Beer was good!"}
{"text":"I much prefer the cozy feel of the Lakewood location over the Tremont one.  The tacos are spot on at both locations, but the atmosphere is more in line with what a great taco joint should be.  I crave the dirty tacos!"}
{"text":"Rudest general manager I've ever dealt with. My friends and I asked to change the channel to watch the Browns draft. We checked with the tables behind us to make sure they were okay with it and they were but they still would not let us change the channel because of some strange policy they have. They instead told us to get out of our seats and move to stand behind people on the other side of the bar to watch the channel we wanted even though we had just been served food. The food is good but the staff is very rude"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Cleveland hands down. Always have fresh chips and salsa, tacos are delicious and not to mention cheap! The food always comes out really fast and it's excellent. When my family visit they beg me to take them there"}
{"text":"Wow was the food in this place a delightful surprise! I went on the recommendation of a good friend who used to live here, and it solidified that she really knows her Cleveland game.  The decor is colorful Mexican kitsch, and there is plenty of outdoor seating. Given I went on a 91 degree day, I parked myself right inside in the A/C. Our server was very friendly and attentive. My star deduction is for cleanliness (we had to clean off the table and seats when we got there, and the floor was covered in broken tortilla chip crumbs).  The food is phenomenal. We started with the Tuscan guac, which has balsamic vinegar, goat cheese and pine nuts mixed into the regular guac. I'm always hesitant to order guacamole because I hate cilantro (tastes like soap), but this was some of the best I've ever had. The balsamic and goat cheese cut the flavor of the cilantro so all you taste is vinegar-y, salty avocado goodness. I wish I had this where I live.  The star of the show is the stoner shell, whether you order it on a suggested taco or make your own. There is a list of El Jefe's suggested taco combos you can choose from, or you can make your own. The stoner shell is a mix of soft tortilla and hard corn with queso and chorizo ALREADY IN IT BEFORE YOU EVEN PICK YOUR TACO FILLINGS. So good. A party in your mouth. There's also a bombshell with bacon bits instead of chorizo, but I didn't get to it this time. I made my own tacos, my boyfriend ordered 2 El Jefe suggestions, and we both agree the best ones are whatever goes into a stoner shell. Mine had jalapeno lime shrimp, chihuahua cheese, pineapple salse and mango habanero sauce. I died from the flavor burst. I was sad when there was none left to put in my mouth any longer. I wish Barrio would open a location in NYC.  The food and drinks were all really reasonably priced. Tacos ranged from $3-$5 each depending on your toppings, and the guacamole was $7. Not bad for filling, flavorful food. I will absolutely be back on my next trip to Cleveland, and recommend it highly to anyone who hasn't yet been."}
{"text":"Dinner service here is hectic and the place is too loud to hold a conversation .  The food presentation is overall good. Other highlights , the salsa and the guacamole were freshly made and full of flavor .  The tacos were ok , not bad but not remarkable . The last thing we ordered were cocktails which lacked flavor.  Perhaps this would be a better place to try for lunch if you don't like noise ? Recommended for younger hipsters or those who like to yell or not hold conversation at all ."}
{"text":"I love Barrio tacos. I love how you can customize the tacos to whatever you could possibly want in a taco. Starting at $3 a taco, the bargain is hard to beat. It's so inexpensive but so good and filling.   Along with the tacos chips and salsa are complimentary. However I highly recommend the queso. It is such a big bowl. You can seriously eat several bowls of chips and it looks like you haven't put a dent in it. Really good for groups. I also love their margaritas. You can even mix the flavors together. And the rims are a perfect accompaniment when you can start to taste the tequila. You can get a sugar or salt rim. Sugar is my favorite. I also like to mix mango and guava flavors if you need a suggestion for a nice tropical drink.  The only downside to Barrio is that it's pretty small. So call ahead if you're coming with a group or even just two people. You're gonna wait a bit. But trust me the wait is definitely worth it. The food and service is phenomenal. Barrio is a great place for a good time with friends."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a must! 1/2 off margaritas and $1 off tacos. The guac is legit. Try the braised beef. Have never had a bad taco here."}
{"text":"Awesome. I'm from Texas, but this little Cleveland taco joint shines wherever you put it. Thai chili tofu? Incredible. Barrio slaw? Phee-nom. Barrio Secret Taco Sauce? The best. AND, it's very veggie friendly!  Hot tip: sit at the bar after 9:00 pm for 1/2 price tacos."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Barrio since the first time I tried it.* I suggest the dirty taco as one of the tacos you HAVE to try (it does have a kick. But for me, the perfect amount). Then I'll choose one where I pick my own contents. I usually do a pork or chorizo with white widow taco and various other toppings and sauces.   They have a reasonable beer, cocktail, and margarita list. If you're going to get a margarita, try one with a flavoring added. It's delish!     *Although, I couldn't taste any of the food because I poured one of their hottest bottled sauces on the wall all over my tacos before I tried a little first. They have a wall of hot sauces ranging from not spicy at all (mango, blueberry, pineapple) to medium (dirty taco) to extremely hot...(bottled sauce with plain white handwriting on it was the one I doused my food in the first time!)"}
{"text":"It's Barrio.  I don't think anything else needs to be said."}
{"text":"If you've visited the Barrio in Tremont or Lakewood, you get it. They're still offering their great margaritas and delicious create your own tacos. They're skinny skeleton margarita is awesome and since its a lightened up version I don't feel bad about ordering two (or four).  I enjoy trying out new combinations for the tacos, and they luckily always turn out delicious. For that I'll credit the good food and quality ingredients, not my superb taco creating skills. The thai chili tofu is one of my favorites- it's just so gosh darn delicious and flavorful. They also have great guac, which is pretty much the biggest selling point for me. If you order it as an app the portion is huge- we had to take half home.  I'm so excited to have this new location downtown. And there will soon be a fourth location in progressive stadium?!!! Amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down I love this place! Lauren was our bartender and she was so personable and very attentive. The other bartenders were super nice as well. Yes it's crowded but hey that's Barrio."}
{"text":"Fun vibe and great food. Very accommodating to vegans. Their staff is great and their bar is top notch."}
{"text":"The food was excellent yes. The truly excellent part of my experience was the service. I didn't get their names but all three of the bartenders were wonderful. They were helpful and very knowledgeable. Being in the service industry myself I really appreciate people that know what they're talking about."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous -- best tacos ever. It's loud, crowded, and tough to get a table/seat at peak business hours, but oh-so-worth the wait. I loved my Marigold margarita and tacos (the El Jefe and El Puerco) so much, I brought my friends to another location the next night of the trip and ordered the exact same thing again. This is a can't-miss business in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, excellent service. I love the margaritas and the build your own taco menu. If you get a chance, their brunch is really great too."}
{"text":"I love how many vegetarian and vegan options there are on the menu here.  There's tofu galore. And everything is clearly labeled vegetarian or vegan. This place knows how to offer veg options the right way. The make-your-own-taco idea is great for folks who like options. For that it's worth coming back to and worth a third star.  However, I wish the food were better.  I ordered two tacos and a vegan taco salad.  All were served not just lukewarm but cold. I get why a salad is cold but when you bite into what you think will be a hot (or at least very warm) taco and instead get a mouthful of cold filling is startling.  Did I mention the filling was cold? Not room temperature. Cold! It makes no sense.  The special guacamole of the day was very good, as were the chips, although we were served a basket of broken pieces that made it hard to scoop up the guac.  The service could not have been friendlier."}
{"text":"I've been to the Barrio downtown a number of times but this was the first time I went to the Lakewood location.  Parking is pretty easy on Madison Avenue or on one of the side streets.  We ordered the traditional guacamole with chips to start.  It was delicious!  And they refilled out chips when we ran out.  There is a selection of tacos that are ready to order or you can make your own tacos.  We each picked two tacos from the ready to order selections and we liked them all!  One of mine was a little too spicy for me but that was my own fault -- I didn't pay close enough attention to the note next to the taco saying it was spicy!  We didn't order drinks this time but I've had margaritas at the downtown location and they were delicious.  Barrio is a great spot for an affordable lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites!  I've never had anything that was less than excellent. The tequila selection is expansive and the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful.  I can't speak highly enough about this place!"}
{"text":"Very cute Mexican restaurant / taco bar in Cleveland. The option to make my own tacos was awesome! Everything was delicious and the staff was friendly. Definitely use caution when trying their hottest taco sauce. My stomach was on fire.  I especially recommend trying their chips and guacamole!"}
{"text":"What can I say? This is a regular spot for us. Build your own tacos with a cute day of the dead vibe. Usually very busy on weekends. Expect a wait. The queso is to die for. A must-order. Pulled pork taco is very tasty."}
{"text":"Came here a few more times since my last review, once for dinner on a Monday, once on Sunday for lunch.  The service is still pretty decent. A lot of people have been discussing the flavoring problem (salt), but for me, I haven't had any experiences where it wasn't salty enough. Now that I've come back a few times, I think Barrio is trying too hard to make some of the taco combinations work. Some of the cheeses don't match up well with the flavors and for some reason, they don't taste authentic to me. Some of the sauces are creative, but they are on the odd side. I don't understand the strawberries and jicama combo when most of the flavors on the tacos are savory. I appreciate the desire to be the happy dog of tacos, but some of the flavors just aren't working out.  I think they also changed their fish taco to a shrimp taco. It's ok, but I miss the fish!  I do appreciate the cheap prices, but if you're not careful, it will get expensive fast!"}
{"text":"Barrio takes me back to a time and place that takes me to a time and place between heaven and earth where I am truly free. When one vanquishes the fear of the unknown you will leave the sins of your past behind. The shrimp here is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Oh Tremont. I remember the days circa 2007 before it was uber hipster and still dangerous. My first attempt to eat at Barrio was a fail last summer. I was at a Tribe game that got rained out on a weekday and my friend suggested we eat here. It was over and an hour wait so we decided to go elsewhere.   I just recently went back with a group of friends. We waited almost 2 hours to get in and barhopped/window-shopped in the meantime. Barrio is well worth the wait! I got chicken tacos that were fabulous. My friends also enjoyed their meals. I really liked the décor with the skeleton paintings on the wall. Great place to eat in Tremont!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Monday service was A1. I don't think it even needs to be said but I'll just say it barrio has hands down the best tacos"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I live in Vegas and when I come home I eat here once or twice every time I am home. However this time it was horrible! They don't know how to seat tables! They sat two tops at a table ready for 6-8 people. Made parties of 6-8 wait way longer then they said. The hostesses don't know what they are doing. But the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"sat down. salsa and chips came out same time as taco box. which the tortillas amd chicken was ice cold as the toppings....piss poor service by management which looked around and said well its packed every other night.....i never write reviews but this d-bag pissed me off. please contact me via email barrio of you ever change management and service."}
{"text":"Loved everything, the food was great and reasonably priced. Even the free chips and salsa were a cut above. I tried so many different toppings, sauces ect. I doubt you could go wrong no matter what you choose. I will definitely return when I come back to Cleveland"}
{"text":"Probably the worst lunch I have ever had in Cleveland, no wonder they are only open on Fridays.  It took a full hour to get two tacos and they charge extra for black beans, really???   We had to beg for water and chips.  The tacos tasted weird and the service was even worse.  The capper was my friend ordering a Choco-taco for dessert only to be told they ran out.  They offered nothing for their lack of service and interminable wait for street tacos.  Never going back."}
{"text":"I love going here! Always satisfied and the atmosphere is nice. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the happy hour section sucks and some of the waiters need to invest in a mirror."}
{"text":"This was a fun, hip take on tacos. Loved the create your own option, experimenting with different meats and ingredients was delish and made me want more. The mango Margarita was perfect and refreshing. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me just say that I love barrio just not this one! The brown haired hostess is rude and has an attitude problem and not only did I witness her being rude to me but I also witnessed her being rude to another customer and talking about other customers. And after eating at the Tremont location frequently the quality of the food and customer service is no comparison and I would not return.  It wouldn't let me post this without putting a star so don't count that star because They didn't earn it !"}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about Barrio. Probably my favorite casual restaurant in all of Cleveland. Amazing tacos (go for the coca-cola marinated steak), amazing guac + salsa, great drinks, all at a really reasonable price."}
{"text":"Super good tacos!  I highly suggest paying the extra dollar or two to get the specials.  The kitchen knows what it's doing!  Atmosphere is spectacular and service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Lived my taco I got when I came for a visit.  Had the chicken with cilantro and Omg could eat more.  Right now."}
{"text":"It goes to show I shouldn't always look at Yelp first.  I thought the food and tacos were awesome. Definitely add sauces, and the chefs specials are great."}
{"text":"We love this place and eat here regularly. I don't know about other locations but this one is great! Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty good. Drinks are good. Everything is overpriced. If you want mind blowing tacos. Go to la plaza when they have their cart out front or inside when they dont.  Barrio seems like a place people go to because it is trendy and the hipster flavor of the month. It is ok but not mind blowing."}
{"text":"Chris and I stopped into Barrio on a rainy Saturday morning for brunch. I have heard a lot about Barrio from friends who live in and have visited Cleveland. I was super excited to see that they had a brunch menu that look pretty unique!   When we arrived right at 11, the place was almost empty other than 5 or 6 other people who were seated by us. This décor is very cool inside and different from Mexican places in Pittsburgh. Immediately, we were greeted by our super nice waitress with a serving of fresh tortilla chips & homemade salsa. Yes! The chips were amazing and the salsa was even better! I could not get enough of it. Another thing I couldn't get enough of was the blood orange Mimosa- perfect hair of the dog! Chris ordered the Bloody Maria (made with tequila instead of vodka)- which he said was a bit too \"peppery\" for his liking of Bloody Marys.  I am a fan of their menu at Barrio- the \"build your own\" style. The brunch menu was a bit more set but I think it's a cool & fun idea to fill out your own menu. We decided on ordering a few things and splitting them between the two of us.  We both agreed that the biscuits + gravy was our favorite thing that we ordered. It was made with jalapeno biscuits and had a chorizo gravy with a fried egg on top. The gravy was amazing- it would be even better if they were more generous with the gravy! We also ordered 3 tacos: Machaca con Huevos, Huevos Rancehros, and Chicken & Waffle and last but not least- a side of bacon. The tacos were all just OK- they seemed to be lacking a little bit of flavor for how unique they sounded on paper. I am giving Barrio a 3-star for now... BUT I plan to be back and order off their regular menu... seems to be the better choice!!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot when I'm going out to dinner with friends. Great staff, great food, and great margaritas! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"GREATEST TACOS EVERRRR! waited 2 hours for a table and let me say it was soooooo worth it. We started out with the chorizo queso blanco, to die for, I'm still trying to figure out if they put cinnamon in it or if my taste buds deceived me! Next I had 3 different tacos custom built with chorizo, shrimp and steak. Presentation was good, pricing was good, the atmosphere was hip and very interesting, skulls everywhere. Definitely will be visiting again the next time I take in a Cavs game."}
{"text":"I enjoy the build your own tacos. I'm very picky so it's nice to have the options right in front of you. The guacamole is also excellent! We liked barrio so much they catered our small wedding reception for a terrific price! I have a had an issue with a to go order one night but the manager was great when I told him about it the next time I went in. I will be back!"}
{"text":"How can I complain about Barrios? Hard crafted tacos with fresh ingredients at $3 a pop? It's mostly build your own, but they also have suggestions and specials. Their queso is something special. Good selection of beers, and homemade margs that aren't overly sweet."}
{"text":"Decent service, great drinks and good food.  Definitely wouldn't come here for a salad."}
{"text":"One of our go-to happy hour spots. Can't get much better than make it yourself tacos at these prices. Tasty margaritas as well, and a great selection of beer. The different quesos and guacs always keep things interesting!"}
{"text":"went for happy hour with coworkers. nice outside patio area for a nice day out. once again made my own tacos and half off margaritas. amazing!"}
{"text":"great tacos! loved that i could make my own tacos. the combination shells are delicious! definitely order the ghost sauce or the secret taco sauce on the side! great margaritas"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town visiting friends; they talk about Barrio all the time! So, they made it a must stop during this visit, and can i just say AMAZING! I love a good taco, but this place has got to be one of my favorites! We went relatively later in the night, so parking was okay, and the wait was less than 10 minutes. Even though it was a full house, service was great as well. I cannot wait to come back to visit again because this will definitely will on the list of things to do!"}
{"text":"Adding a star because now that I've been her a few times, they do have some killer tacos. I still don't like how crowded the tables feel though and the service wasn't great."}
{"text":"Barrio takes a few tries to warm up to their food. You have to find the perfect taco creation order. Once you do be sure to take a picture of your order and keep it saved to your phone so you can remember to order it's perfected recipe next time.  Their margs are awesome, their beers are cheap and their service is always on point. I personally prefer the atmosphere of this Barrio location in Tremont, but I do enjoy all the location's tacos.   Also don't forget to split the guac & queso for the table. It's well worth it!  Barrio is Bae. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area. I always take friends from out of town here because I've never been disappointed with the food. And if you are looking for a place to go to for amazing margaritas, this is the place to go. I HIGHLY recommend the peach margaritas. A pitcher is $28 and they don't water it down whatsoever. The only negative thing is that it is always busy, so don't go if you are looking to sit down right away. Every time I go there it's at least a 45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Best tacos around, and you can mix it up every time you go so you never get bored. Always great beers on tap too!"}
{"text":"What do you want first, the good news or the bad news? Ok. The good news: everything here tastes delicious. The bad news: as sure as night follows day, the kitchen will screw up your order, and you will be served something that bears only a passing resemblance to what you ordered. This will not be your server's fault, because you will have filled out the order slip.   But, do not despair. Though you may have wanted a chicken taco with hot sauce on a corn tortilla, your steak taco on a hard shell with queso will be delicious.  Update: I went again yesterday.  Like Babe Ruth famously calling his home run shot, I informed my guests during the ordering process that they should be prepared for a botched fulfillment -- and Barrio delivered big time. Not only were 3 of 8 tacos orders wrong, this time we were shorted a taco! But, as before, never have mistakes tasted so good! Barrio is like an idiot brother: it will consistently screw things up, but you will love it anyways."}
{"text":"The one downside to this place is it gets packed on any given evening, especially the  weekend.  Knowing that, a Saturday afternoon was our best bet.  Sat down instantly, service was great, chips were on point, and drinks came fast.  We ordered some regular queso, and some salsa verde that was very tasty.    Tacos were ordered, and came out within minutes (literally minutes, just as fast as any other mexican restaurant).  The options are amazing, and you can really customize what your tacos taste like.  I chose a chicken and pork taco, with the other half choosing a taco and a bowl.  Both were amazing, but then again we know mexican and know what our palette's like.  If you are just ordering a little blind from the menu, it's easy to  get a foreign taste.  If you like tacos, do yourself a favor and make it out here!"}
{"text":"Very unique atmosphere and ordering setup. Great, big draft beer menu. Tons of whiskeys and tequilas to choose from as well.   Awesome food."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at Barrio in Lakewood was a enjoyable time. We arrived just before noon and the place was already full, the good news is that we only had a five minute wait for a table. A few general informational items parking is on the street with a small public lot just across from the restaurant. The interior has a Mexican \"Day of the Dead\" festival feel that is not overdone - no fear of scaring small kids. The sound level was a bit loud but you could have a conversation in normal voice.  We started with margaritas, chips, salsa and a order of guacamole. The drinks were well made and the salsa and guacamole were excellent. I was surprised by the portion size of the guacamole - there was enough to share between 4 adults. The drink menu was surprisingly large with draft and bottled beers and large tequila and whiskey list along with mixed drinks.  For our main course we opted for the El Jeffe recommend taco selections leaning to the combos that were on the spicier side of the menu. You can also order your taco any way you want, selection of ingredients and styles are infinite. Our taco were tasty and I would rate them on tops for tacos that I've had on the west side of Cleveland. Final note our server was prompt, accurate and checked in enough to be attentive but not overbearing."}
{"text":"Heading into Cleveland for the first time, we stopped at Grove City, Pennsylvania, and a guy working at one of the shops told us about Barrio.   As Canadians who love Mexican food, naturally we said hell yeah we're going to check it out.  Not a single regret.  Personally, I like how this restaurant focuses on taco's only, allowing you to either get what they offer to put together or building your own custom taco.  I can't remember now what I had, but I can remember the happiness in each bite. If I come back to Cleveland again, you bet I'm coming back to Barrio."}
{"text":"Tacos = Good. Cocktails = Mostly uninspired.  Get a beer instead. Happy Hour = Always loud and crowded.  After ordering, expect no further service from bartenders.  A check is out of the question.  Bring cash and keep track of your happy hour tab: pay and leave.  (Or figure a 20 minute wait for the check.)"}
{"text":"These tacos make me drool. I dream about them. I would eat here daily if I could. The servers are amazing too"}
{"text":"In terms of entrees I've only ordered Build Your Own Tacos here. For this you get a pencil and an order sheet and choose the type of tortilla, meat/protein, cheese, toppings, and salsa you want on your taco(s). I unfortunately am not a fan of the tacos since they resemble something I could slap together in my own kitchen if I bought the ingredients. Build Your Own Tacos are $3 each, which is a little expensive in my opinion. My friend got queso and chips which was a little pricey at $8 but the queso was delicious. One plus is that you get free chips with salsa regardless of what you order. Happy hour here has reasonable prices on margaritas, which are offered in a variety of flavors."}
{"text":"The first time we went, it was OK. It was a Friday night. About an hour wait, but the bar, although busy, was attentive. They also found us amongst the sea of people when our table was ready. I realized I put way too much on my tacos that night. Sauce, salsa... They were super mucky, but my bad for being over ambitious. The same story the second time around, but I had learned my lesson on taco creation. Two tacos- shrimp, jicama slaw, cheese, & tomato soft taco, & the beef, cheese, corn salsa tomato soft taco. Brilliant! The shrimp /jicama combo is crunchy, sweet & perfect. Love the corn salsa. Paired with blood orange margaritas, it was perfect. Not the best tacos ever, but worth the weekend wait. It's pretty hipster, but that hasn't negatively impacted our experience."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated.  I feel like this is what happens everytime someone tries to have \"designer\" tacos.  Tacos are not meant to be designer.  It's already a perfect food!  I came here with a group of four after the Ale Fest and after biting into my first taco automatically wished I was more drunk so I wouldn't be thinking as hard about what it was that I was eating.  The tacos here are sooooooo boring!  Everything tastes the same.  And the men/ordering form is kind of confusing.  Only bonus is that this place is cheap."}
{"text":"If you are indecisive, be warned. Lots of delish options here. Had the shrimp taco, blueberry margarita and the tres locos guac. Chips were fresh and salty margarita was good, wanted to try the jalapeño but thought I should what until next time.  Maybe tomorrow there can be a next time...."}
{"text":"Worst Service ever. First time i went took over an hour after i ordered to get the food the place was pretty empty and it came out cold. They didnt charge me for the tacos but i didnt eat them ether. Left starving and swore I'd never go back. Was convinced that i should give it another try and basically the same thing happened, except the tacos were luke warm. Margaritas are good."}
{"text":"I come here for drinks and chips/salsa. The tacos are a bit gimmicky and lackluster. Fun environment though."}
{"text":"Favorite taco spot in Cleveland!! I love creating my own tacos with the creamy garlic shrimp, cilantro jasmine rice, pineapple and creamy garlic sauce... Alec, Kristina and Gia are my favorite servers here. They are always working so hard with a smile and friendly attitude. Barrio is my home away from home."}
{"text":"Customizable tacos, delicious margaritas, queso and guac that are to die for, and bottomless chips and salsa...all for a low price!  Their happy hour is great too - I believe it's $3 margaritas and $1 off tacos (or something like that).  Yes it's almost always busy and you're probably going to have to wait for a table, but in my opinion it's definitely worth it.  Overall, this Barrio is a great addition to the neighborhood and you can never go wrong by eating here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. I guess it's always crowded because it's the cheapest, trendiest place in Tremont. I have a had time believing people come here for the tacos.   I ordered two tacos, one pulled pork and one beef. I have never had such empty tacos. There were only two bites of meat on each. The beef was also sitting in a pool of tomato-y water.  Not so yummy. Speaking of water, my margarita tasted like H2O. I'm pretty sure they forgot to add tequila.   They also messed up my table's check, ringing up my credit card twice."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!! I was going to go anyway after seeing in on Yelp but 2 people mentioned it and I was impressed. Great food, great margarita and atmosphere. Would go again in a second!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night. The specials were only at the bar. Major bummer considering bar was full and we were only ones in dining room. Tacos ordered a-la-worksheet was nice. Would benefit from some pre-selected ones. Flavors were pretty good. Margaritas were diverse. I'd go back. In fact, I will definitely go back and take my mom. The decor is phenomenal. The skulls and murals are so cool to look at while drinking and eating. The patio looked very interesting too."}
{"text":"I loved this place before we even got our food, simply because their windows advertise \"tacos, tequila, whiskey\" and that is almost literally all they serve. Too many restaurants have walmart syndrome and have an enormous menu of mediocre food but Barrio features a minimalist menu, and everything we had was great.   The menu the waitress handed us was about as big as an average food menu, but it's entire contents were tequila and whiskey. We got a pitcher of mango margaritas which were as good as any I've ever had. The chips and salsa were above average as well.   The food \"menu\" is a paper pad that has all of the taco options, you go through and tick off boxes of ingredients to add to yours. It's like a taco SAT. The shells were all good, the meat was exceptional (the steak was actual steak. Even had a hint of pink in it), the salsas are awesome and there are a variety of unique sauces to add on top. They also don't skimp on ingredients, at a mere $3 a piece they fill the shells as much as they can.   I'm not from the area, and I love trying new restaurants, but it will be hard not to come to Barrio again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Another fun place to make a home in Lakewood. There is also a Barrio in Tremont and it has the same menu and vibe. You fill out your order on a piece of paper like a sushi place or happy dog. I wish they gave it back so I knew what I ordered. The salsa is awesome and definitely has a kick. I didn't care for the fish of the day taco which was a baby shrimp ceviche. And the chicken was just OK too. The chipotle cream was great an surprisingly spicy. 2 tacos were plenty for me, but my boyfriend could probably eat 4 easily.   Their pick a flavor margaritas were super syrupy sweet, and tasted like sour patch kids or the peach gummies covered in sugar, but the specialty ones were delicious and fresh, especially the grapefruit. I look forward to going back and trying other taco combinations."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite taco places I've ever been to. I always make sure to visit when I'm in town. The food is great, the margaritas are awesome, the decor is super fun, great music, and fast, friendly service. However, the wait to be seated is usually quite long and there is limited space in the waiting area and the bar. Over all, definitely my favorite tacos in the Cleveland area! I always crave this when I'm back in NYC and would love to see a place like this there!"}
{"text":"Build your own tacos for three dollars! They are two dollars during happy hour! This place is called the \"Happy Dog of tacos\" for good reason--you check the ingredients you want on a list, including type of tortilla and side items, and it is promptly delivered to your table. A common complaint I noticed while skimming other reviews is that the food is not salty enough. What? My tacos were not lacking on any flavor, and the other people I have gone with (have been here four times total) all agree with me.   Excellent margaritas as well, with infused flavors such as pear, blood orange, and pomegranate. They are served in mason jars, which brings a little hipster class.  The only complaint I have is one of the nights, our server was not attentive and kind of rude. It wasn't busy that night. Maybe she was having an off day. I'll let it go for now.  When building your tacos, don't get TOO many ingredients. If your taco is soggy from piling on the sauces and salsas, you only have yourself to blame."}
{"text":"I've been to this location about 5 times and not once have I been disappointed in any way!  Unbelievably my best experience here was before a Cavs home game that I forgot about. The place was jam packed so the two of us sat at the bar. Bartenders got to us right away. Food came out super quick and as usual was delicious! Kudos to this bar and kitchen staff I was amazed at your service even at a busy time you impressed this customer"}
{"text":"I went to cleveland hts lovation with three friends. The service was. Slow and rude.the food was less then average. .bathrooms were. Dirty. You would think being new location it should be top notch We will not return"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos.  Thought two would be too little but I could only finish one and a quarter. Build your own taco was clutch and writing down your own order was a nice, unique touch!"}
{"text":"Hmm. I'm torn.   Barrio is located in the old 806 space. I love what they've done with the place.  I had a GREAT time at Barrio last Friday night with a big group of loud, obnoxious friends. (I was probably the loudest and most obnoxious.) I think there were 14 of us. Service was great. No gripes there. Our server was efficient, friendly, and informative.  The atmosphere was also great. I always thought the patio at 806 was one of the best in the city and they have kept that same great patio at Barrio. We were lucky enough to be seated out there.  I have to mostly agree with Habby on the food. It was pretty bland. We must have dumped half of a salt shaker into the guacamole and the salsas. Most restaurants that I frequent don't even put salt on the tables because they know how to spice their food properly. Barrio needs a bit of help in that department. Even their *hot* salsa was bland. Disappointing. I like HOT and I didn't get HOT here.   I LOVE the build-your-own taco concept. Just keep in mind: if you order several different sauces / toppings you should be okay spice wise. But yeah, like Habby said, the soft tacos came out soggy which was kind of a bummer. Had they not been soggy they would have been good.   I loved my dranks but they could've used some more tequila in them. (Maybe I'm just too much of a lush?) Whatev.   Another thing.... be aware that they can't split up a check. Normally, this kind of thing doesn't bother me in the slightest. But when people are out in a giant group and they want to nickle and dime the shit out of the bill instead of splitting it all like adults --- yeah, then the rest of us are left paying for everyone else.   I'll give Barrio a bit more time to spice things up before I return."}
{"text":"Great tacos ! Very good service !long waits during busy hours ! Go figure for such a popular place !"}
{"text":"Service was good delicious flavorful Tacos and  good Vegetarian options I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure my experience here rates two stars, but I'm giving Barrio the benefit of doubt. We were here late (around 12 AM on a Tuesday) and maybe that impacted the food and service negatively. I'll Barrio one star for location and another star for beer selection, the fact that they make a decent drink, and the place is pretty cheap. Service gets zero stars. It's inattentive at best. The food we ordered was awful. We order two different types of vegetarian tacos as well as queso. The queso was so thick and goopy it seemed more like a roux cheese sauce that you'd use for macaroni and cheese. The taco featured a good amount of uncooked rice and congealed queso. Even after having a few drinks and being extremely hungry, the tacos were barely edible."}
{"text":"Great fun place with a definite laid back, but cool Tremont type atmosphere. You know what I mean. I mean, you do if you are cool ;)  It has a limited food menu, but a good one. It's a happy dog-ish, choose-your-own-adventure, taco menu. I would like if they took a cue from happy dog and offered some barrio special suggestions, I always order a weird mix on those things. But what I got was good.   There was also great guacamole and the salsa that came with the chips was really good too. Just the right amount of heat and super fresh.   My only negatives were the patio was full so we didn't get to partake and I wish the soft taco shells were heated. But otherwise great staff and atmosphere.   The margaritas were S-T-R-O-N-G-AH. And that's coming from the alcoholic at the table. Like she only could have one and still drive coherently kind of strong, and that's saying something. I'll go back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you have read other reviews of mine, you can notice that I really like Mexican food, and Barrio to me falls at the top of my list.   I have been numerous times to this location, as well as a few times to the Tremont location and I am always given a consistent product.  It's like Chipotle, Piada or any of the other 'make your own' concepts.  It may take a taco or two to really figure out what you like, but once you get your taco you could eat it every day.    Everything is fresh, one time I went and we ordered Guacamole and they said their delivery of avocados were not up to standards and they apologize but are technically \"out.\"  While I was very disappointed, I was very satisfied that they were not going to serve a product that was not good enough for them.    As far as guac goes, they have this one with panchetta, pine nuts, and some sort of cheese with a balsamic glaze and it is absolutely delicious!  I love their traditional one as well, but lately I have only been able to order this special one.  I can guarantee you there will not be a bite left and they give you a HUGE portion.    Their tacos are fresh and delicious, you can get whatever you want.  One of my favorite tacos is their pulled pork, with slaw, cilantro and onion, corn, and the first two sauces listed.  It is so good!  I will say I am not a big fan of the cheeses, but I am also not a big fan of cheese in general, they have a little different flavor than another 'traditional\" Mexican cheese.  Also, their house taco sauce, stay away!  With all the fresh ingredients you can get on your taco, it seems to ruin it.    The best part of Barrio is HAPPY HOUR! It goes until 7, and it is $3 margs (half off) and then $1 off tacos.  You can get two margs and two tacos and leave with a bill of $10."}
{"text":"Barrio is seriously the bee's knees. A friend suggested this place while we were visiting. It was packed for a Thursday night. My gosh. The margaritas are amazing. Went down like water ( But lets be honest, when dont they?! )  It's a build your own taco deal. They give you a paper and you check off all these super yummy and unique things to build your taco. They are massive tacos, could hardly finish 2 of them.  The place itself is super cute. Right by progressive field. The patio is the perfect people watching spot!"}
{"text":"Great chips, great margaritas, nice service but the tacos could use some work. If you want a place to socialize and get drinks I recommend it. If you want to focus on great food well I might check out a couple other options. Still I'm always happy when I leave there so I'm sure I'll return for the margaritas. Happy means buzzed."}
{"text":"Barrio is my favorite place to eat in Cleveland. It's cheap and delicious. Also the environment is pretty rad. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap Mexican food. Tacos are only $3 and have some amazing sauces! I got a pulled pork rice bowl with crack sauce and it was delicious. I love the aioli sauce as well. Awesome margaritas too."}
{"text":"Made my own veggie taco... And it was awesome!The green goddess tacco .. With the soft and Hard taco is a must try with whatever toppings you like! Great ambience... Good drinks and really resonabally priced! I am going to go back once I am done trying new restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh ingredients.  Loved the house specialty tacos, they are full of flavor.  The make your own tacos was a fun process.  Loved the salsa that accompanies the chips- not your typical plain, tomato based mexican salsa.  Great stop"}
{"text":"How this place is always packed, let alone gets returning customers is a mystery. Worst tacos ever. The braised beef tasted like dry roadkill. The service was worse than the BMV. Our server was extremely annoyed every time we needed something, didn't come to our table for 45 mins. We had to eat our dry roadkill without drinks because getting a refill was apparently just impossible. All-around horrible experience. The hostess was really nice though."}
{"text":"Very happy that Barrio added this location! They have such incredible food and a fun atmosphere   The past couple times I've been in, there have been problems with their frozen margaritas but other than that, I would 100% recommend this location!  Very good options for vegetarians too! Try the mushrooms  for a unique twist!"}
{"text":"Too many flavors going on. The tacos seem way too complicated. Trying too hard. I couldn't identify all of the flavors in my tacos. Yes, lots of flavors, but if you like simple, good Mexican food, I wouldn't recommend it. Very hard to eat it, because it is so messy, and the portions for the rice and beans were insanely small."}
{"text":"Bad service, worse tacos. I wanted to like this place but it's just a pretentious wannabe taco place. But the margaritas are good"}
{"text":"Great price, big servings, and super tasty ($4.50 for a large specialty taco). Definitely not what I would call authentic Mexican , but some of the best bar food I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour, and it was awesome! Tacos are $1 off, and most of the margaritas are half off! After coming from an underwhelming happy hour elsewhere, this one was fantastic! The drinks were sizeable, and the tacos, as always were delicious. Also, with the supplement of free chips and salsa, you really don't need to order too much to get full!! Food was delicious, and you really can't beat the happy hour prices here. 5 stars without a doubt, and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Mexican/Taco fan but I appreciated being able to make my own and get something I enjoyed. Everyone else at my table really loved theirs. Might not be worth the wait for me (again, I'd rather go for just about any other cuisine), but I think my group enjoyed there's enough to come back."}
{"text":"I used to love Barrio. But lately it's so jam packed it's really tough to get in. Two times in the past week I happened to go there and both times the employees were rude. First the server I had one day snapped at me because I wanted some guac on something, \"well that's why it's under 'sides' they won't do that.\" Last night I went and I stood right in front of the hostess while she proceeded to \"not see\" me. When she finally saw me she seemed entirely disinterested and said \"it's an hour wait\" and went back to ignoring me. We went somewhere else. Tacos are good but they're not THAT good. Usually soggy anyway. This place is getting too big for it's britches. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"There is perhaps no greater indictment against Cleveland's reputation as a \"food destination\" than our continued celebration and support of Barrio, a local-chain (with 3 locations in a 5-mile radius -- whyyyyy?!) that your suburban parents will definitely love. No authentic corn tortillas even offered here - just your basic-ass flour tortillas and the Ortega-style \"hard tacos\" that you were served as a kid. Welcome to the comfort and conservatism of Cleveland dining.   Also, an honest question: why is it completely acceptable for us white folks (who the Barrio owner/operators are) to appropriate Mexican culture to such a high degree?  Mexican folk-art is plastered all over these locations. If I were to, say, open a bastardized African restaurant (like Barrio's bastardized \"Mexican\" restaurant), would it be acceptable for me to have African tribal art all over the walls? (No, it would not - it would be creepy and weird)."}
{"text":"Exceptional taco joint! Cool atmosphere, full bar, small cozy dining room, large outdoor patio and great customer service. They have a few different ways to order your tacos, one you can order off their suggested list or you can build you own. They also have brunch list as well and the tacos are very inexpensive so you can order a few.  We ordered:  Strawberry goat cheese guacamole with a balsamic reduction. This had great creamyness and texture. It was just a tad to sweet for my taste. But I did eat the whole thing.    Smoked salmon brunch taco (caper & scallion cream cheese, chopped egg, red onion, dill crema and everything bagel spice). Fantastic what a great take on bagel & Lox.   Chicken & Waffle taco (orange-thyme waffle battered chicken, collard greens, bacon and bourbon cinnamon maple glaze). For some reason these flavors just did not work for me. At first bite it tasted like the bottom of a fire pit.   Then we built our own tacos  One was their stoner tortilla (soft flour tortilla layered with queso & chorizzo and topped with a hard corn tortilla). Filled with Coca-Cola marinated steak, smoked cheddar, cilantro, onions, corn & pepper salsa and a cilantro crema). The steak was absolutely pheonomimal. Don't get me wrong the whole thing was spectacular but that steak. Wow!   Next was Green Goddess tortilla (soft and hard shell with queso & guac center). Filled with shrimp, garlic crema, queso fresco, apple jicama slaw and pineapple salsa. Delicious! All the flavors melded perfectly. If your in the mood for fun and tacos this is the place."}
{"text":"I've now visited this Barrio several times. I'd been to one of the locations on the west side, and I was delighted that they'd expanded to my part of town.   The food at Barrio is delightful - their only real food is tacos, and during happy hour, they're super cheap - $1 off. The best deal in the place, though, is their margaritas. At $3 during happy hour, they're a steal, and they're quite delicious. Try the jalapeno flavor, and consider mixing it with another fruit flavor!  Their tacos are delicious and truly hit the spot. There's a ton of variety insofar as what you can put inside them, and the choices I am able to enjoy (I'm a pescatarian), the fish, shrimp, and tofu, are all fantastic.   My one big complaint is the lack of happy hour tables. As I mentioned, their happy hour specials are a big draw to coming here, but they have a limited number of happy hour tables when compared to regular tables. The bar is also an option, but if you're there with a group, it can be quite difficult to get a table as the wait is often an hour or more. The staff is honest about it, which helps, but it's still disappointing to go to a place expecting happy hour and then effectively be forced to sit at a regular table.  I'll be back despite these shortcomings. Barrio is too good to pass up."}
{"text":"Decent spot, but was a tad underwhelmed with the salsa.  Overall, though the staff was friendly and taco's were very good!"}
{"text":"Margarita paradise! We were in the area for an event at Quicken Loans arena which is literally across the street and saw the great reviews on Yelp and stopped in. Initially we were told there would be a 30 minute wait and given it was an event night thought that wasn't bad. It started raining/storming outside and patrons didn't move from their tables and 30 minutes turned into 90 mins but we held out because we had plenty of time prior to the event and had already been waiting too long at that point. I am happy we waited!  We were sat and brought some excellent fresh and warm tortilla chips and traditional salsa. We got the sampler with Queso blanco, pineapple salsa and traditional guacamole - all of which were excellent. The pineapple salsa was so bright and sweet - perfect with the salty chips and mixed in the guacamole. My husband and I made our own taco concoctions and all the proteins (Fish, Shrimp, Cola marinated Steak and Chicken) were flavorful and cooked well. There is a great list of toppings and sauces to choose from. Food orders came out fast and as ordered.   Food was excellent but the Margaritas were outstanding! There are a nice selection of rimmers to compliment your margarita flavor choice. I personally loved the jalapeno margarita with smoked salt rim and Pomegranate with cayenne sugar rim.   Prices were very reasonable, service was fast (once seated) and friendly. Food was excellent with tons of options to please everyone!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos, and very good value....especially during happy hour. Very good amount of beers and half price margherita's during happy hour are a bonus. Service was a little spotty but not terrible."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best taco destinations I've ever been to. Create any number of taco concoctions based on your tastes and. Just. Wait. Sauces are phenomenal. Warm chips. Perfect destination before a game...but plan for a wait. Bar is first come first served and is often the best bet for getting in. It IS LOUD however - the one drawback- thus the 4 stars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Nice atmosphere and decor. Margaritas and sangrias are on point and delish. I love that I can make my own tacos the way I like it. I have never been disappointed and always bring visitors here. they love it. It's pretty packed in the summer on wknds but u can always take it to go. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest, my expectations really weren't too high for this place. Don't get me wrong, it was not bad, but I have definitely had better.  We got the app sampler with chips and guac and salsa. The salsa was a-ok but the guac just had too much extra stuff in my opinion. I had to dig around just to get the guac itself.  Onto the tacos. I am no expert but I love tacos that 1. has a shell that tastes homemade 2.  seasoned and flavorful meat and 3. can't put it down until I am finished.  The tacos here fulfilled almost 1 of the three.  The shell definitely tasted like it was bought at the Mexican aisle at a grocery store, the meat was ok, but there was just so much added watery sauce that it was difficult to keep it from dripping. I did not have any issue putting them down and not looking at them for a while.  Apologies for sounding like a taco snob, but tacos are literally the best and this is just my own opinion. Overall, I don't know if I would come back unless convinced."}
{"text":"Absolutely exceeded our expectations. Portions are big for the price (we went during happy hour). The coca cola steak was great...the pulled pork and chorizo are equally good! Make sure to try the jicama slaw condiment!   Even the salsa that comes with house made chips for free is great.   We had a top shelf margarita and high end draft...4 loaded (choose your own) tacos and got out under $30!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Lakewood Barrio is amazing! The restaurant is on the small size but the service is very fast and efficient the customer turn over is fast. I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. They always start with complimentary chips and salsa, which are amazing! The salsa is homemade daily and has a fantastic smokey taste to it! The servers are very quick, they come by get your drink order and when they come back they take your food order. Food almost always comes out in under 7 minutes. And it is Delicious!   They have a garage type door that they replaced wall windows with so when it's nice outside they open that up and have tables on the \"patio/sidewalk\"! It's such a wonderful place and the environment is so hipster! I literally eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great selection to make your own tacos and each one is a great size! Also the white queso is muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"This is my 5th trip to Barrio and this is the first time I was truly disappointed if it had been my first visit I wouldn't return. I always try to at least taste the new Taco of the month but yesterday's was so disappointing that I took one bite and told my waitress I just didn't like it instead of offering to bring me something else she said, \"well I guess you'll know better next time.\" She was the only waitress I've ever had at Barrio who just didn't care- took forever to get refills never brought part of our order after multiple requests- just couldn't get it right she just was not interested in us.  Oh well maybe we'll try one of the other locations if this is the level of service they're going to provide at Tremont."}
{"text":"If you are an Aries like myself....you know what you want. At Barrio...you get what you want. This build your own taqueria is a perfect addition to the neighborhood. Since my first time, I have brought many friends to try this gem and I have heard how they go back time after time. Actually, last night I spotted a friend who brought her bf for date night on the patio! Perfect!  The atmosphere is chill and the staff are friendly and will get you whatever you are looking for from a marg, to your choice of hot sauce or more chips and salsa if you haven't had enough after your first basket.  The tacos are literally going to be what you want. You pick. Soft? Hard? Beans/Tofu/or your choice of meat then you add on your toppings, salsas, cheeses. It really is that easy. And they aren't these wimpy tacos. they are packed. And you can add on extra beans, rice, cheese, sour cream...whatever you want.  It is first come first served. You have been warned. So if you need a table for a group I suggest getting someone to go early, put your name in, then sit at the bar and have a drink and relax. There is a list of drinks to choose from. I've never been disappointed but always head back to the signature or blueberry marg.  Obviously I've been a few times....and plan on going back many more! Def want to try their new brunch menu. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"No one greeted us. I've been sitting here for 20 mins.....no one approached me asking if I wanted anything yet. Honestly, that is the worst thing you can do to an avid yelper such as myself. This is 2018....how has an establishment not mastered basic customer service.....? I will never return. I suggest you don't either.  Negative star."}
{"text":"Omg amazing tacos (get a special taco shell!) and delicious margaritas for a very reasonable price! Ended up eating and drinking at the bar due to the wait but no complaints overall! The bartender was attentive and did not rush us. Very much enjoyed the vibe too. Would defs come back!"}
{"text":"My most favorite food in the world. If I could eat here every day I would. Really good tacos, well priced with unique flavors."}
{"text":"I think I'm the last person in the area to try at least one of the Barrio restaurants. Last night, that all changed! My husband and I met another couple here on a Saturday evening at 7ish.  I was really impressed with their wait list process where we check in at the host stand with our cell # and we can leave the establishment if we would like to avoid the shoulder to shoulder crowd in the bar area. We stepped away and enjoyed cocktails in the bar next door. We were given a wait time of an hour and 20 minutes. My phone rang an hour and 15 minutes after we gave them our name/number, as our table was ready! Once seated, we were immediately greeted by our awesome server, Emily! She spent a good amount of time with me going over the ordering process and made some great suggestions since she asked if we'd all visited Barrio before. The place hopping, tables were being turned around time after time. There wasn't an empty table the entire we were there. We took Emily's suggestion in trying the the special queso, which was Crab Rangoon Queso. Yep, that's what I said, 2 of my all time FAVORITE ooey gooey goodness creations combined! I thought I was being punked and kinda expected Ashton to hop out of the back room yelling at me that this was all a joke and I would not be receiving anything of the sort! He didn't. The queso dip came out and was devoured by 3 of us (fortunately my friends husband isn't a fan of crab)! It was the perfect blend crab rangoon flavor with the thick creamy queso. The only mini-complaint was it came out luke warm and quickly chilled to a thick glob that broke our tortilla chips when we tried scooping it into our gaping mouths.  We ordered a pitcher of regular margaritas. It had great flavor, seemed to have fresh lime juice but I don't think there was too much tequila. All four of us know our margaritas and none of us thought there was any or too much libations  We weren't expecting margaritas similar to other places where all you taste is tequila, rather, a taste of tequila complimenting the natural ingredients. But we got over it and finished the pitcher!!  I ordered a chicken taco with the green goddess (or green goodness, according to my friend) shell, meaning you have a hard taco slathered on the outside with guacamole and queso then wrapped with a soft tortilla!! The taco was huge! There's no way I could have finished two. Everyone else at the table ordered 2 & were very very full. I had chicken, peppers, onions, tomatoes, pineapple salsa and queso wrapped up in the green goddess shell! I would do it all over again today if I could!!!! My first visit to Barrio was pretty good! Next time, we're going to get there a little earlier to enjoy the bar area and enjoy the total Barrio experience!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite taco place in town! Definitely not an authentic Mexican food experience by any means but the quality is great. The tacos are quite cheap for how large they are - starting at $3. Monthly guacamole, queso, and taco options are always creative and delicious. Always endless possibilities for tacos as you can pick and choose exactly what you want in them.  The wait can be a bit long depending on what time you arrive, but the food usually comes quickly once you place your order. I would highly recommend Barrio to someone who is visiting Cleveland and looking for a delicious, reasonably priced restaurant!"}
{"text":"You say tacos and I am there in an instant.  We passed Barrio walking into town and were told its a really popular spot with great food so we stopped in on a Saturday night around 730.  Off the bat, it definitely seemed like our kind of place - large, bustling and duh, with tacos!  We started with a margarita and the trio that comes with your choice of salsa, guac and other dip...We chose the corn salsa, white cheese queso and their special of the day guac.  All were very good.  Chips were fresh but in a smaller bowl so we had to keep getting refills for the size of the serving of the dips.  Next, we ordered 3 tacos each. One taco of the day, one make your own and one off the menu.  The taco of the day (it was made with pork belly) was by far, the best.  Others were just OK.  Neither of us finished the other two tacos.  I think this place is amazing for a happy hour spot where you can get appetizers and fun food, but I think the tacos are really lacking.  I have been to a LOT of taco spots and normally I will only eat at them if they have a soft, authentic corn tortilla option.  I think it makes such a difference.  Unfortunately, here they only serve them on soft flour or hard corn (or you can order a combination of the two).  It seems basic to me and underwhelming compared to what I think they could do with corn tortillas.  I will say the meats on the tacos were cooked well, and the tacos themselves had great flavor, but it just wasn't all there for either of us.  The atmosphere and service get 5 stars, but probably wouldn't go back for a sit-down meal.  Definitely would try somewhere else I think."}
{"text":"I love the food at Barrio including the queso! I went for happy hour to enjoy some margs and tacos but it was difficult to enjoy the food I love due to the service! Took 25 minutes to get water refills and more chips since we were not given any with the queso (after asking). Oddly our waitress literally ignored us only coming to take our order and give our checks. To get water and chips we had to ask another waiter. I give this review with hesitation because I really enjoy the food and usually atmosphere but today the service was just nonexistent and left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite restaurant anywhere! The tacos are amazing & at a great price! The margaritas are always changing. Not to mention, during happy hour you get those margaritas half-off. The salsa is delicious.   I ask my boyfriend to take me here for valentine's day. When I die, bury me in stoner shells."}
{"text":"Was in Cleveland visiting relatives and decided to give this place a try. As someone who lived in California and is used to good authentic Mexican food, I have to say their tacos and margaritas are pretty damn good.  The chips and specifically salsa they bring for the table are very good.   I don't care for all the gimmicky toppings but the simple chicken, onion and cilantro tacos were very tasty. The green salsa was a little sweet but not too bad. Overall I'd recommend this place and will probably be back."}
{"text":"Great concept of ordering your own tacos just how you like them.  I loved being able to pick out my own toppings, sauces, meats, etc.  It was also a perfect option for my vegan friend offering tofu tacos.  Very cool decor inside and outdoor patio would be great on a warm day.    I'm not giving this 5 stars due to not so great service.  Our waitress had no personality and was just about the least friendly server I have ever had.  She was hard to track down and service was very slow.  I wanted to make this 3 stars because of her, but the tacos were just so darn good so I will keep it at 4 stars for this particular visit."}
{"text":"The food is amazing... The service not so much. If you can overlook the long waiting, and only seeing your waiter maybe twice the entire night, then it's worth it. I go because of the amazing food, just wish the staff was better."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hours in Cleveland! The food, service, and atmosphere are fantastic. Easy parking. Elaine was an amazing waitress who was super efficient and took care of our busy party of 7 very well."}
{"text":"While I wish that I could have improved upon my previous rating, alas I cannot.  Not for lack of trying though!   It's nothing against Barrio. I still love my favorite hipster taco joint. BUT the inconsistency across locations and from visit to visit makes it really hard to give any of the locations (other than the Tremont one) more than a solidly mediocre rating.   I will say that the drinks are consistently delicious, although I'm sure that this is due to the marg mix that they make at all the locations and the fact that they have very specific recipes for the signature margaritas.   As for the tacos they are all over the place, and the service if the place is busy is kind of awful. Like I waited so long for a check once that we could have left and the server wouldn't have known for 10 or so minutes,"}
{"text":"Always the best   The queso and Guac of the month is always amazing - margarita perfectos  My big dog baby gets to join me on the patio. Best tacos hands down."}
{"text":"This place blew me away! We ordered a few tacos and we had to order more. The price is unbeatable for amazingly good tacos. The cocktail menu also had great options but the prices were standard. Worth it though. Our margaritas were perfectly blended and not overly sweet."}
{"text":"This place just kicks ass, from the decor to the drinks to the food. You order like you do at The Happy Dog - you fill out a checklist of things you want on your taco and give it to the bartender (or server, but we always sit at the bar). Get the pork with the pineapple salsa, you won't be sorry! :-)"}
{"text":"Date of my visit: 4-January-2017 Time of my visit: Very late dinner  After the Bulls-Cavs game, we were in a mood for Mexican food.  Again, with a help of Siri, we found this joint.  It was within a walking distance from the Q.  We arrived, checked in with the hostess and waited for about 20 minutes.  Once seated, our waiter came over right away, took our drink orders and explained how the ordering system works.  Let's start with that, its tacos only Mexican, you get a piece of paper, where you will mark your order, either by popular items or create your own taco.  Almost felt like adults playing with crayons...  Well, we placed our order.  I took 4 tacos (a pair of them had mushrooms, but I specifically asked the waiter not to have them) and my girlfriend ordered 3 tacos.  We also took Queso Dip for our chips.  It was endless chips and free for the table.  Chips came with salsa.  Our food arrived relatively quickly.  The tacos were very interesting....  Some came in soft shell, others came in hard shell and others came in both...  I took a bit of my tacos and the first thing I tasted was a mushroom...  The good news was, the waiter had them both remade very quickly.  Overall, it was a B experience.  It's one of those hippies/man bun wearing type of place.  Food was good, service was good, a sold B."}
{"text":"Meg is a fantastic server! That young woman was awesome. my husband, myself, and our three young girls were in today and she made the entire meal so enjoyable! She was polite, funny, and nice to the girls even when we could tell she was starting to get a little busy. The food was great and the drinks were even better. The only thing I wished for when I left was a larger table! Squeezing a family of 5 in a 4 person table was a bit hectic but it was a great experience all around."}
{"text":"One of those rare gems that serves good food late.  I love their tacos.  A long list of options guarantees lots of tasty combinations, something for everyone.  My main complaint is the noise level, which on an average night is somewhere around the decibel level of the back row of a rock concert.  If you're sensitive to noise at all, eating inside is a no-go.  Thankfully they have a patio, unfortunately the patio closes early.  However, if you're willing to go in and order at the bar and wait, they'll let you take your food out to the patio and eat (sans server, you're on your own and you need to clean up after yourself) and that suits me just fine.  Definitely a good choice for a late night meal."}
{"text":"Great tacos!  It's all a la carte and you can make your own taco if you're a picky eater like me!"}
{"text":"I think I might just be too loyal to the Tremont location because other than the fact that there is no outdoor seating I had a perfectly good experience at the Downtown location. Despite this, I can't help but feel a little meh about it. The location feels a little weird, like kinda mall-y since it's connected to the Galleria and you can see the other places from the bar area. The decor is pretty typical Barrio and the food and drinks were great.  Considering it's proximity to E 4th its strange that there is no outdoor seating. I'll definitely be here before games and for cheap late night eats when I'm downtown. I don't think I'll make the trek downtown for Barrio though, I'd rather go to the Tremont location."}
{"text":"Interesting decor, fun way to order, and very cheap. The food quality is excellent for what it costs. A very fun place to be."}
{"text":"There was nothing that I didn't like about this visit to Barrio.  I went as part of a group for work, and Barrio didn't disappoint.  We had a reservation and our party of 8 was seated immediately.  Our server approached shortly thereafter for drink orders, while we contemplated our taco choices.  I opted for the peach margarita, sugar rim, on the rocks and the El Jefe taco (2).  Shortly after taking our order, the server returned with fresh tortilla chips and spicy, yummy salsa.  The El Jefe tacos were excellent, sweet, spicy, crunchy, juicy and oh so satisfying.  The peach margarita was the perfect accompaniment.  We finished our meal with shared desserts.  There are only 2 on the menu, chocolate taco and sopapillas.  I didn't taste the chocolate taco, but the sopapillas were very tasty.  I'll definitely return to Barrio."}
{"text":"This is the Lakewood restaurant. It has great vibe. Always crowded and we were lucky to be seated within 45min on a Tuesday evening. Service is efficient.   Cocktails are between $8-$10 per glass and the pitcher are $24. $10 margarita was pretty strong.   Coming to the appetizer. Complimentary tortilla chips and salsa are fresh and tasty. The $6guac was standard fare. There are bottles of sauces by the wall with a lot of variety but unfortunately most of the bottles were empty!  Coming to the tacos one can go with the menu item or if you are adventurous make your own. They are $3-4 but anything extra prepare to pay more. The tacos can be hit or miss depending on the ingredients you select. The Thai villi tofu was little hard and chewy. The white widow tortilla was  ok. Chipotle crema sauce is more sweet than spicy. The combo of spice marinated chicken wither the salsa verde and barrio secret sauce was the killer. I wish I had put the barrio secret sauce to all the tortillas ordered. It's not spicy for my palate. Next time will try the Carolina reaper, it's described as 'hot! Hot! Hot!' So is this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really great food. It was late and the ordering system was a bit tough for a newbie, but the Taco's were amazing! You're likely to have a wait during prime time, but it is worth it! Atmosphere is fun an casual."}
{"text":"Our favorite pre-game Tribe win meal near Progressive Field.  The perfecto margarita was very good, since it's not all sugary.  Worth paying a little more.   Not crazy about their chips, as I prefer thin and crispy, but the salsa is terrific.   Had the taco special, fried green tomato taco and built my own for #2.  Picked the stoner tortilla shell, which is the best shell I've ever had.   Now, GO TRIBE!!"}
{"text":"I've been to barrio a few times now and when they get your taco order correct, it is amazing. I've had a few of the chef specialty tacos and they are delicious as well. Unfortunately it seems they only get your order right half the time, which is a bummer. On one instance they brought me an incorrect order and when they took it back to correct it, it came out wrong again. I would give it 5 stars if they could consistently get your order correct."}
{"text":"I'm a whore for tacos and as soon as I heard about Barrio's happy hour, I knew I would be in love.  Well, so far I have not been disappointed. Even without happy hour, Barrio is an excellent value, but happy hour is 4-7PM, $1 off of tacos and half price margaritas....what else do you need? Oh yeah, free chips and salsa! Ole!  Their margaritas are legit, I always get the casa on the rocks, I do wish that they had a couple of specialty margaritas that had a more traditional flavor profile.  Most of their specialties have grapefruit, berries, or mint.  I'd love to see a traditional marg with a spicy profile.  So, the tacos.... they are perfect.  However, at Barrio, it's all about knowing what to order, my husband and I have both found the chicken to be bland, the pork to be too sticky/sweet (think cheap bbq), but the beef is life-changing and the chorizo is also top notch.  You can add as many toppings as you'd like and I recommend that you get the green goddess or stoner shell, treat yo'self.   The chipotle (hot) crema is one of my fave toppings and you can't go wrong with the cilantro pesto and the cilantro and onion topping.  The free chips and salsa are a great way to start the meal, the salsa has a wonderful soft and smoky heat and the chips are freshly fried and topped with a generous handful of sea salt.    Service is always top notch and the clientele and decor is hip without trying too hard."}
{"text":"What can I say I was disappointed. My wife and our friends went here after hopping down from the Beer Engine for drinks (margaritas) and salsa and was totally met by a rude server on the bar side of the house.   Most places that have a separation between sitting area and the bar area allow patrons to sit at a high rise table. Well unbeknownst to us this was not the case and we were practically no served. The guy who was the waiter came by and told us to either put reservations in to sit down or leave.  For first timers to this place and being told that the food is great I was deeply disappointed with the staff. I'm still on the wall if I want to give them a second chance. Hopefully the management will reach out and learn from my visit to their place. Rude workers will cripple the communities opinion of your establishment.    My wife and I do not get out a lot so we were ready to drop a hundred or so for some good food and some late nite drinks. What a pity that server could have made some good tips off of us."}
{"text":"I used to think this place was decent enough, but with each subsequent visit, I've been increasingly disappointed! I love the atmosphere/decor, and service is always fine. The tacos themselves are what is lacking! The ingredients are always room temperature at best (often cold, cheese not melted at all) and soggy. Initially I blamed myself for my filling choices, maybe I put too much sauce or things that drip, but it seems like no matter what I order, I have this same issue. The taco shell with the guacamole in it (green goddess? Sorry I can't remember the name) was their saving grace but last night when I got it, there was literally a square inch of the shell that was what I ordered- the rest was a regular flour tortilla. It also had barely any meat in it. I'm sure I'll be back for just margaritas and the guacamole (love the ones with goat cheese in them!) but that is it. Normally I wouldn't complain about such inexpensive tacos but everyone hypes it up so much, I had to bring it down a notch!"}
{"text":"Food: 3.5/5 Environment: 4/5 Service: 4/5   Verdict: Wouldn't mind going back. Especially if the corn salsa changes.  Food: So let me be honest.... The first time I was here, it was after a night drinking with a couple friends to celebrate a reunion but I really don't like Mexican food much. But then being able to customize my own tacos for a decent price definitely helped change my mind. The food was well-made and delicious, ALTHOUGH the one main exception to my disliking of Mexican food are corn salsas.I loooooove a good corn salsa. The portion for it here is amazing but that definitely didn't matter much because it tasted like straight vinegar. I was about to ask the waitress if it always tasted like that but I thought that would have been too rude.  Environment: One of those dim-lit sort of restaurants that establish a decent mood. Granted it was like 1:30AM on a Saturday but it was cool enough. The painting on the wall were pretty cool -- very \"Dia de los Muertos\" and we were seated by a fireplace near the back. It looked like they had a great patio outside too but since it was pretty cold, they obviously wouldn't be using that!  Service: Not bad. When it's busy, it's busy. Can't really help it but it was sufficient. Our waitress was really helpful since I hadn't been there before."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Very loud and it wasn't that busy. Black beans so salty I couldn't eat them. Totilla chips super greasy and salty. Poor cuts of meat in the spicy chicken. Asked for sauce on the side and it never showed. Inattentive servers. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Cauliflower and leeks in guacamole? Who would've thought it makes for quite a tasty combination. It's been some months since I've been to Barrio, but I felt compelled to write a review after being thoroughly disappointed with a trip to Bomba. Eating their lackluster tacos wishing I was at Barrio with a green goddess creation..."}
{"text":"Barrio is a great casual location for cheap, but delicious tacos. it is a unique custom order concept where you check off the items that you want to build your perfect taco. I think that it is the sauces that really make the tacos great. I recommend the cilantro lime aioli, it is my favorite but they have other great ones too. I also recommend the stoner queso, it is a little over priced, but is best to split with friends.  I love to go during happy hour. Tacos are $1 off making them $2 each and margaritas are half off making them $3 for house and $4 for a flavor. The only problem with happy hour is that it is almost always packed, especially during weekends. The deals are only in the bar area as well so you either have to wait longer or be lucky enough to grab a bar stool seat.  Overall its a great place with a fun, hip ambiance. The only reason I wouldnt give it a 5 is because its a little over rated. The tacos are good, but they are still just tacos.The wait is also sometimes a turn off for me since usually they have no good area to wait around in especially during the winter.   Definitely try it out, especially if you are not from Cleveland. All the Clevelanders love it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before the Indians game for a quick bite and I have to say we loved this place! Great food and excellent service! The chips and salsa they bring out were great, chips are fresh made and salsa was good with a bit of a kick which I appreciate as I feel like you don't always get that. We also had the queso which was perfect.  On to the tacos, as others have said you get to build your own. There a so many options for meat and toppings. They start as $3 which is a steal as they are decent size. For one of mine I paid the $1 for the white widow which added queso, Guac and crunchies and also did the Coca Cola marinated steak with some other toppings and salsas. The steak was so good and tender! I also had a shrimp taco with mango habanero salsa which was also yummy though the shrimp were a bit small (but for $3 this was okay by me). Everyone else in our party loved their creations. Oh and if you aren't feeling creative they offer some house favorites. We would hit this place up again for sure!"}
{"text":"I am so picky when it comes to tacos and Mexican food & Barrio really hit the nail on the head when it comes to customizing a taco all for ME-- the possibilities are endless! The salsas, sauces, various meats and shell options (at least the ones that I selected) were different from any taco I have ever tasted and the combinations all meshed so perfectly. They give you sheets with all the options in which you check what you would like and give it to your server. No questions, no complications and NO chances of any surprises- it's that simple. I had the diablo margarita which also was totally different from anything else and so refreshing. I love casual spots like Barrio and the inside, as well as the outside patio are SO cool. Oh, did I mention  I could drink the salsa they give you with the chips when you first sit down?? I went on a Wednesday night and it was so busy (but not too busy) and that's how you know it's good! 5 stars for customization, innovation, temptation and gratification!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about these expensive soggy tacos. Both locations were crowded each visit and the tables are so close that if you backup in your chair, you'll hit the person behind you.  This is like the mature adult version of going to Taco Bell after a night of fun and drinking because nothing else is open. You still pay for it in the morning, you just paid a heck of a lot more per taco."}
{"text":"Great food. Horrible parking. Rude staff.  1st time I thought because so busy and new. 2nd time I thought hmmmmmm.  3rd time is a pattern.  Staff at the bar are rude and poor service. You have to open a tab at the bar at least that is what I was told.  I ordered a blue moon, the bartender didn't offer a glass which is ok but the beer was not cold so I asked if there where any colder beers and he said they were all the same so I asked for a glass, some ice and orange slice.  I could tell he labeled me 'the pain in the ass' customer.  When my friend showed up, we waited to see if he would notice her and come over.  He was watching sports on TV. I had to eventually interrupt him to get a drink order.  So the food is good, poor service so I thought next time get the food to go.  Well the tacos get soggy to fast, need to be eaten at the restaurant for the best experience."}
{"text":"Great cheap eats.  Know what you are getting when you go here.  Crowded restaurant so you usually have to wait.  But good drinks and fun time."}
{"text":"They  have everything it takes to make it great but never quite get there. I ordered two tacos to go (my bad). Both were the wrong ingredients, completely wrong proteins and they even return the order checklist with stuff circled. No onions meant they put extra onions on both tacos. Sadly I was too far away when I opened the bag. I recommend checking everything before leaving with to go orders."}
{"text":"Fun bar. All the tacos were excellent. I love that they let you mix your own flavors for margaritas.  I usually don't like house made ships because they are normally too greasy but their chips were perfect (not greasy or too salty).  Our waitress was super kind and helpful too."}
{"text":"Cleveland is tied with Gary, Indiana as one of the worst places to ever find yourself so it does not surprise me that this disastrous chain is thriving here. The tacos are disgusting and the tequila-less margaritas are clearly $6 for a reason. That all would've been terrible on its own but then during the middle of my \"meal\" I came to find a man at the end of the bar taking his orthopedic boot OFF in the middle of a busy dining room during dinner service. I then watched a sever hand him a shoe with a sock in it for the man to put on. A couple times throughout the \"meal\" this booted man put the boot on and took it off MORE THAN ONCE. Bare foot for all to see. Video to follow.   0/10 stay out of Cleveland."}
{"text":"We live super close, and eat here at least once a week it seems! The green-goddess shell changed my life. I've tried all the meats on the menu and in my opinion the pulled pork is by far the best - nothing else even compares. A lot of the taco sauces are pretty spicy. I go for the chipotle honey if I want a little kick, or the cilantro lime aioili if I don't. The Tuscan and pineapple guac are so amazing - the traditional guac is nothing special. Their seasonal quesos/guac/tacos are usually pretty good too. Tacos are super filling - especially if you get chips/salsa. 2 is way enough for me! Only complaint is that they don't have online ordering for take out and going through the menu check-list over the phone can be cumbersome (and they've gotten my order wrong a few times because of it)"}
{"text":"Having been to Condado in Columbus many times, I pretty much knew what to expect: día de los muertos style decor and great customizable food.  Some notable advantages of Barrio are free chips and salsa, something Condado does not provide. The queso was also delicious.  I had two tacos, one each with braised beef and the coca-cola marinated steak. They were both fantastic. Get the Green Goddess shell - it adds a lot. I also especially enjoyed the apple jicama slaw."}
{"text":"Barrio was good! We have Condado Tacos in Columbus so I was curious to peep Barrio out. We got queso and guacamole to split and each got a taco which was great! The feel of the place is very cool and you pretty much get what you paid for - affordable and a step up from fast food dining. I'd definitely go back to Barrio next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"If you are in Cleveland, you have to stop here. We just stumbled across it last night and went in - not knowing anything about it. Sure glad we did!  We were seated immediately. No wait - but the place was rocking and had people everywhere.  The staff quickly helped us understand the menu - which the have a build your own taco order card that they are mostly known for! Really cool idea and made ordering a breeze.  The food was incredible - and the queso was the best!   Stop in. Give them a try! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer, Jameson on tap, for those who need that  Great food, build your own or choose from a set of prebuilt options, that we're very tasty. Hopping busy on a slow Wednesday night.  Staff seemed a little burnt out, though did not take a way from the atmosphere, food or drinks."}
{"text":"I want to give more stars, but the last three times I've come to Barrio, they've messed up the order. I get that it's busy, but they've been around long enough not to F it up regularly. Wrong items, missing takeout items, whatever, it's not like this is a new place. If you can't handle a crowd, it isn't worth the hype."}
{"text":"I was at Barrio for drinks and tacos. The drink menu is expansive, as is the pick-your-own topping selection of tacos. I had the stoner and green goddess shell selections, and found them both very light and flavorful. I was a bit skeptical at first because I have been to taco places where the portions end up very small with few toppings placed in each taco, but here each taco was very filling and a good value in my opinion. All of the toppings I chose were delicious, especially a number of the sauces. I am a big fan of the rice and cheese sauce served with tortilla chips."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place because of its Yelp reviews. We keep coming back for more! We love the build your own taco concept and the prices! We also love their out of the ordinary guacamole combinations when the it's the special of the day."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and my friends recommended that we check out Barrio- their favorite taco bar in Cleveland. We arrived before a show around 6 on Saturday night and waited about 10 minutes for a table- beware this place is PACKED! By the time we left their had to be a 40+ min wait.  Upon sitting we were greeted by our server and she walked us through the menu, which consisted mainly of BYO tacos. We started with the trio of queso (really good and cheesy), the pineapple salsa and the pineapple guac. The guac had a really funky taste to it, which we decided was the pickled red onion, that gave it a spoiled taste. I think the red onion was way too vinegary - so be aware when ordering it.   We all did BYO tacos and I was blown away by the different options you could get- from taco shell, protein, toppings, salsa/sauces. Here's what I ordered:  TACO 1: Corn tortilla, grilled portobellos mushrooms, queso fresco, cilantro, sautéed peppers+onions, salda verde with the cilantro line aioli This was my favorite taco. The portobellos we're cooked perfectly, and the cilantro lime really brought it together. Great options here for vegetarians.   TACO 2: Corn tortilla, braised beef, queso fresco, cilantro + onions, pineapple salsa The braised beef was very flavorful and I loved the sweet combination of it with the pineapple salsa.  TACO 3: Corn tortilla, spice chicken, cilantro, onions, salsa roja, chipotle crema This was a basic taco, but again, it was really good and I throughly enjoyed it.   After the food came to the table I instantly regretted (but did I really?) getting 3 tacos. I'm from Charlotte and most of our 'street tacos' are very small (4\") so I was expecting that, but these tacos were huge and stuffed with toppings. I mean, with endless toppings how could they not be stuffed?!  Overall, Barrio was good (loved the large selection of taco options), service was fast and the margaritas were tasty! I would def return if I was back in the area again."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio downtown and visit the Willoughby location.  The night of our visit Barrio was very busy.  At the bar we had the nachos which were served warm in some spots and cold in others.  We were seated at the table and my tacos were cold and they should have been hot.  The atmosphere is electric and very loud.  So loud you have to shout to be heard but the person across from you.  We finished our dinner and headed elsewhere in DTW.  I expect this location is hot because its new; unless they improve their quality Barrio will not longer be a hot spot."}
{"text":"We got the Barrio food truck to come to our offices recently, and the food was okay. I got two chicken tacos and one black bean taco. First, the black bean was okay, but very salty imho. Next the chicken tacos were not highly flavorful other than the sauce which had a little kick to it. Why three stars? The chicken had small, but very hard pieces of chicken bone, which doesn't ruin it for me, but it's definitely something I'd do everything that I could to avoid as a restaurant cook/chef."}
{"text":"this is the place to be. the decor is kinda weird but has it's own flavor. flying skeletons on bicycles lit up in christmas lights. i've only ever sat at the bar. the bar is where i like to be. it can get pretty busy here and sometimes people are waiting for tables. have not had to wait for a seat at the bar yet. this is a great place for vegetarians. the thai chili tofu is soooo goooooooddddd. the portabella is delicious. you build your own so don't blame anyone else if your taco is bland bc their ingredients and sauces/salsas are the bomb. don't even understand the people out there saying they got bland tacos. did you just get cheese and chicken? there's like 6 different kinds of sauces and 3 salsas. the drinks are also amazing. i've had their margaritas and their cocktails. love the agave mule, and the figgy bourbon. yum. happy hour is amazing for half off margaritas and dollar off tacos. the tacos are already cheap, but during happy hour it's cheap af. you can eat and drink like a king here on the regular, and even more during happy hour. eat here, leave happy."}
{"text":"alright barrio, you have won me over.  your happy hour is amazing. I'm not sure if I will ever come when it's not happy hour bc the happy hour makes me so happy.  I don't understand the decor. skeletons on bikes lit up with Christmas lights. yeah ok.  the key here is to make a good taco. easy right? I mean, you can create your own masterpiece and pick your own toppings, but that can be dangerous when you're like me and want ALL OF THE TOPPINGS. I made that mistake the first time I went and my tacos were real weird tasting. today I found my perfect combination. unfortunately I have no idea what I marked off on the paper so I'll never be able to recreate it.  I must say though the green goddess is the way to go. ugh so delish. they also have tofu which is great. although their tofu is fried tofu and the texture can be a little weird. I wish they had regular tofu. it's still yummy.  and the margaritas! half price during happy hour between 4-7. beware the + $1 for flavored is not half off! I can live with that. they make them strong and tasty. you can also just get tequila straight up. that's half off too.  I can get full and drunk for $10 plus tip? yeah I'm in.  oh yeah I need to come back for Sunday brunch soon."}
{"text":"Easy 4 stars for the price. Young crowd, good beer, big selection and food timely and good.  They actually missed my order out of 5 and made up for it by delivering within 5 minutes.   The waitresses were nice, prompt with the water and beer.  Not a formal place so don't take the suit and tie client there."}
{"text":"I come to Cleveland on business fairly often and I try to always eat someplace local. I like to try new things and support local businesses. I had a craving for Mexican food so I found Barrio and decided to go for it. I had some meetings until late in the day and I arrived around 8:30 pm. I was blown away that on a Monday night after 8:30 there was a wait at this place! I figured it must be insanely good.   The hostess took my name and gave me a pager. Within a few minutes, a seat at the bar opened up and she ushered me over. She said I could eat dinner there or have a drink while I wait for my table. I decided to just eat there. That actually might not have been a wise idea because soon enough, a couple decided to share the one chair next to me. On the other side of me was a group of intoxicated college students. I felt, quite literally, stuck in the middle.   The bartender took my order. As the hipsters usually are, if you aren't one of them, they aren't particularly friendly to you. I got a jalapeno house margarita, guacamole and chips, and three tacos. Three tacos was way too much, probably because I underestimated the size of the guacamole serving. It is HUGE! For $6, damn. Unfortunately it was pretty blah. The chips were too salty as well. So luckily the guacamole wasn't salty because otherwise it would have been a bad situation.  The margarita was my favorite thing. It was very spicy and I liked that. The flavor was good but not much alcohol. As for the tacos, I got the spicy saparano, the el filadelphia, and carne trozo. The el filadelphia was actually my favorite. The taco held up well, the Portobello and steak were grilled perfectly. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The spicy saparano was a hot mess. The whole thing fell apart in 2 seconds. Basically all the toppings toppled off. It was really yummy but it was a nightmare eating it. By the last taco, the carne trozo, I was pretty full. I took a bite to get the full flavor and it was underwhelming. The meat was really delicious and I picked all that out and ate it.   I think the way they serve the tacos could be improved upon. Everything was juicy and sloppy and eating at a bar sandwiched between super annoying people just kind of put a damper on things. If they served the tacos on a tray or with one of those taco stands, I think it would be so much better. Wrapping the tacos in tinfoil just causes them to get more soggy. I can't imagine getting carryout. You'd have taco soup by the time you got home."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio twice. The first time was with friends and was shortly after the opening. I chalked the poor experience up to growing pains and didn't write a review at the time. I went back last night and now feel comfortable that this is how the place is run.  Speed of service does not exist at Barrio. Because of the limited amount seating, this quickly cascades into a train wreck. We were quoted a 30 minute wait time for a table and were only the 2nd people in line. 45 minutes later, we were finally seated. One might assume that the kitchen would operate assembly line style since the options for building your taco are fairly limited. You would be incorrect. Both times, it took over an hour to get our food. Like other reviewers, by the time the check arrived, I didn't want them to drop the check and run for fear that I wouldn't see the wait staff again for another 30 minutes.  I've given this place two takes and there won't be a third. The food was OK but nothing to rave about. That I could tolerate as it is at least affordable. For what the style of food, speed of service should really offset it. That never happens here so you're left with a local version of Chipotle that somehow takes an hour to make a taco."}
{"text":"This is a simple review. Been here a bunch of times. Always fun and informative servers. Simple menu, quality food, and reasonable prices.   We love love love the decor here, so focused and makes you look around the whole time you are there, I mean how cool is it to have a skeleton wearing a sombrero riding a bike above your head while you eat tacos? The tacos are great sizes and portions for the price. I love the beef, pineapple slaw, and chipotle honey glaze especially!! They also have fun hot sauces on a shelf on the wall so ask for those or go walk up and grab something fun.   Only downside is the parking is hit or miss, location is very tiny, and the wait is usually extremely long making it hard to show large groups this place due to no reservations."}
{"text":"I think this place is HYPED up, bigtime. The atmosphere is OK, service could have been better as ND honestly,  the food tasted better the 3rd day....however they've been there so obviously they're doing something right."}
{"text":"Bestvtaco spot ive ever been to they have a wide range of flavors. I love this spot lol"}
{"text":"Amazing what this does for Downtown Willoughby. Already a growing area with amazing restaurants surrounding, this just tops it all off. It attracts young professional people. Keep me coming."}
{"text":"We went at 11am and it wasn't too busy.  The brunch tacos were amazing.   The French toast seasonal bowl was delicious.    The dirty taco was so good.   The service was friendly and on point"}
{"text":"Nice place. Great atmosphere and food, but I have to give them 2 stars for my Tuesday night visit. Tuesday is supposed to be 1/2 off Margaritas, which the hostess confirmed before she seated us. However after enjoying our meal and drinks, our smiles quickly faded. Apparently only certain tables are included in the Tuesday deal, which AGAIN we inquired about before being seated. Seems kinda shady to leave that part out. I guess we sat in the expensive Tuesday section."}
{"text":"Never disappoints! Favorite spot for a midnight snacking or even grabbing just drinks with a few friends. If you're looking for good food and good vibes, Barrio is definitely the place to be. Just a tip: ask for sauce on the side, that way you can decide how much sauce/where you want it (if at all). Some of my favorite tacos have been DIY ones (you can't go wrong with bubbling in your choices!), and although their seasonal guac might sound weird (think cranberry sauce guac, dates and goat cheee guacamole, etc.) give it a try! I have yet to try a unique guac here that I haven't liked."}
{"text":"Omg where do I start! My husband and I went here awhile back and had a terrible experience and said we will never go back. Fast forward to tonight, out with friends they said give it a try again maybe it was a bad night. NOPE! Service was terrible, it took 35 minutes for one taco and one bowl and the queso dip was cold. Asked server why it was taking so long he tried blaming it on how crowded it was and kinda blew us off. That's twice now.  I think I am done.   I normally don't write reviews but I felt that I needed to this time.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Great drinks and decent tacos. The tacos aren't served hot so that takes away from their potential. The restaurant is kind of small but the environment is really laid back. The waitresses are friendly and explain how ordering works for first timers."}
{"text":"I mean, c'mon. It's Barrio. It's really freaking good. When people ask me why I love Cleveland, I just say \"Barrio.\" It's cheap (if you don't get drinks), food comes out quick, and chances are, you will always see someone you know. Barrio is definitely a go-to for pretty much every Clevelander I know."}
{"text":"Did not get food, and it was the second stop of the day for a nice Friday liquid lunch. I don't even remember the drink I ordered, but it did have an orange slice in it. My point here is the waiter was super friendly, knew the menu and was able to suggest something I would like and it was a very relaxing environment."}
{"text":"This is my second favorite of all the Barrio spots (Tremont is last place).  Everyone's reviewed this one to death just like the Tremont location, so I'm only going to say a couple things.  Service is good, food is fresh and good, and they even have comedy on some nights.  If I'm in Lakewood and I want a taco or a great Tequila-based drink, I  stop here.  The Whiskey is spot on here too, BTW.  Whiskey Wednesday's in the bar is reason enough to stop by even if you don't like tacos.  The only reason why I knock off a star is because service at the bar gets a slow and spotty when they are busy.  I don't like having to hail down service like I'm trying to get a cab when I'm seated at the bar."}
{"text":"Holy chip and dip! I love this place. I always heard my friends talking about going and I finally went with them! I love the food, but the chip and salsa are so damn addictive. Went during breast cancer awareness month and the chips were pink. I thought that was pretty cool. Tacos are amazing as well. I like how you can customize them, and their super fast to get your food out."}
{"text":"Tacos! I don't go downtown often, and Tremont even more rarely, so a Barrio opening up on the east side was possibly the best part of 2017 to date.  It's ridiculously crowded right now, but I imagine it'll die down a bit eventually.  In good news, the hostesses are nice and they'll give you a pager that works as long as you stay within a block or so radius, so you could always grab a drink somewhere nearby while you wait for your turn.  They've got a great bar menu, with a good selection of tequila and margaritas.  A pitcher is approximately 4-5 glasses, which isn't a bad deal.  We split two pitchers with another  couple-- one guava and one blood orange-- and it worked out pretty perfectly.  I liked both, but the blood orange was definitely my favorite of the two.  If you're not a margarita person, I'm confused, but they have other good drinks and a nice beer menu as well.  As far as appetizers go, the queso blanco is excellent.  It reminded me a lot of Moe's queso.  Tacos, however, are the important part of Barrio.  You need 2-3 tacos for a good meal, depending on how hungry you are.  They're only $3-$4 each, so it's a really reasonable night out.  They have a menu of suggested tacos as well as create-your-own.  From the El Jefe suggestion list, I really liked the El Filadelfia steak taco, but my husband didn't care for the braised beef in the Carne Trozo.  Creating your own tacos is more fun, in my opinion. I will warn you not to go overboard on the toppings even though they all sound delicious.  You can bubble in as many items as you like, but if you overload your taco it nets you a giant soggy mess.  Another item worthy of note is that the Green Goddess tortilla option is a calorically terrible choice but also Barrio's gift to the taco world; it has the crispiness of a hard corn tortilla, the structural integrity of a soft flour tortilla, and guacamole and queso to bring it all together.  I'm already perusing the Build Your Own Taco menu to plan out my next visit.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Barrio is famous in Cleveland, and for good reason. These are great tacos! I tried them for the first time at their truck at the Fabulous Food Festival a few months ago.  I was excited to end up here for lunch with friends last weekend.  You can get create-your-own tacos or choose from their specialty menu. I did one of each, and while designing my own was fun, I didn't do the best job. The shrimp was great, and the barrio secret sauce and queso fresco were too, but the cabbage topping kind of overwhelmed the whole thing.  Also, next time I'm making more adventurous tortilla decisions, because my friend's green goddess with queso and guacamole looked excellent.  I also had the huevos rancheros taco and loved it, but I think I'd ask for more hot sauce next time.  Speaking of which, if you're a hot sauce fan don't hesitate to go big and don't be intimidated by their pepper symbols; the sauces all have great flavor but to me the three-pepper secret sauce didn't pack much of a punch.  It's crowded, so plan on waiting a bit, unless you get there before noon. Even though they were slammed, service was great, and we got in and out and back to our conference in around an hour.  I don't go downtown too often, but I'd make the trip for more tacos, and I can't wait until the new location opens in Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, service was great and the food was even better.  Two people in my group, took copies of the order sheet, to remember what they had and the food was so good i cant blame them. The stoner shell...amazing. The jicama slaw will be in my dreams, along with the pork and sopapillas for the next week. The interior was gorgeous too. Did I mention the tacos were only $3!!!!!!! And two will fill you up. I am surprised at the quality, I will never go to Taco Bell again in Cleveland. The chips and salsa were excellent. The interior was gorgeous and the patio looked beautiful. So many great things to say, you have to try this place."}
{"text":"Some days I rave about Barrio and other days like today I'm underwhelmed with Barrio. It's more so/so than rave lately. Now that I think of it, I think I rather just make tacos at home. I hate that they charge a $1 for rice and $1 for sour cream. I'll just go to Chipotle and get more for less money than Barrio.   Service is always so/so. Our waitress shift ended right after we paid. We were still talking and I was finishing my last taco. She never passed us off to anyone. (So we could get checked on) All I wanted was more water. I wanna hydrate.   The atmosphere is dialed here. I love the murals on the wall, and how dark it is inside. A lot to look at and admire.  Barrio is good every few months when you need reminded how so/so it is."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the Cleveland area with a fun atmosphere. Recommend going at an odd time, because it can get quite busy and loud. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"Finally got a good spot for tacos in the east side!!! Yeah! Pretty self-explanatory menus. There's a \"build your own taco\" menu where you have your choice of tortillas, a long list of proteins, then toppings. The tacos are only $3 ea., but are pretty big and filling. 2 of these can make a meal. Then you have a pre-fixed list of tacos, in case your brain doesn't have the capacity to make delicious decisions late at night. They also have a weekend brunch menu. I tried the biscuits and gravy. I was skeptical at first... ordering B&G from a Mexican joint... but let me tell you, this ain't your Bob Evans B&G. Try homemade jalapeño cheddar biscuits, chorizo gravy, cilantro, topped with a fried egg. Wow!! Talk about flavor explosion!! We also tried the French toast bowl. A pleasant surprise that it came out more as bread pudding, topped with bananas. It was our dessert! Overall, awesome experience. You can easily fill up for less than $10 per person. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This should more than makeup for having the Browns!! You control your own destiny at Barrio. You would have to suck pretty hard at controlling to find yourself unhappy."}
{"text":"Like many gals in my life - won't text me back... after putting name in   Weak/tart margs  good tacos - compliments to the creator  mediocre hipster service  dank queso   will probably go back soon"}
{"text":"We had such high hopes for this place after several good reviews; however, I was not happy with the tacos. I had a hunch going in that these were not going to be authentic, but was hoping that the flavors would be good enough to distract me from this fact.   We tried the braised beef and pulled pork. Both were very dry, but the tacos were also too cold.  The tortillas were cold, and did not hold up to the moisture of the toppings.   I will say that the queso blanco was tasty, and the beer/bar selection was pretty good. We would consider going back for drinks and queso if friends were going, but we will not be going back for tacos....and the quest for good Mexican food in Ohio continues."}
{"text":"Please do not waste your time or money, Everybody who work here have drug addictions and that why the service is so poor . I have gave this location plenty of chances. Food is always wrong ,nasty and soggy . Customer service is beyond terrible. I was there with my family party of 7 trying trying to celebrate my nephew college graduation, and the staff treated us like we smelled like shit. I have never been so humiliated at a place where I an spending my money  . I told my server that I am allergic to chicken , they still gave me chicken in my tacos, everybody who ordered tacos , food was mixed up and wrong and nobody cared. If I was the owner of this location and witness the staff treating customers like this , I would have fired them all . People who work in these places have no clue about good customer service or how to treat people , they must don't like money, they probably only need a few to get their drugs at the end of the night. The assisted manager stood by our table harassing us while we sat there , and told us that she was instructed to do so. When I asked for the manager , she said she was the manager and that their was no one to talk to . Places like this don't need to be in business because even a kid know how to make tacos and be nice while doing it."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick bite when visiting Cleveland. The wait was only 20 minutes which was impressive because the place was packed but we ended up finding bar seats immediately available so we just took those! 1. They have purse hooks which I always appreciate 2. Their staff were so attentive and helpful! We had at least 3 servers consistently checking on us and ensuring our food was good. 3. The food was PHENOMENAL! I didn't make the best choices with my \"make your own taco\" combo but that was totally just me - their preselected tacos, queso, and guacamole was SOOOO GOOD! Drool-worthy. They were also very happy and quick to refill our chips for free!"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual. The waiting list is not well organized. Busy during weekends and there is no parking. Service is not consistent, somedays we get phenomenal service while other days the polar opposite of a good service."}
{"text":"The tacos are great! The only negative thing I could say is that some of the tables are really crammed next to one another."}
{"text":"First time I've been to this Barrio. Just as good as the one in Tremont. Nice outdoor seating as well. Server was very friendly and quick too."}
{"text":"I've been several times now. Delicious tacos. Great margaritas. Service was pretty good. The first time the service and food were both great. It was a pretty busy Friday night but everything ran smooth. The second time was a Thursday and while the service was great it did take a little longer for our food to come out and one of our orders was incorrect. We had no problem getting it replaced though. Over all a great place to eat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite late night bars to go to with great tacos it can be spicy but just trust the combinations. you should try the stoner or the green goddess taco.  They have a great patio for summer time where you can bring your dogs and just relax if that is more your type of thing however there is also bar seating and tables whatever your mood suites."}
{"text":"Some of the suggested tacos were a little dry. Dry tacos aren't awesome. Make your own seems to be the way to go. If you don't love spicy, probably stay away from Bario's secret sauce.  Took a shot of the ghost chili sauce. Probably don't do that unless you want a little heartburn.  Service was great, margaritas we're perfectly adequate."}
{"text":"Great prices fast service! Wish they would Open up more seating in the \"bar area\" for happy hour."}
{"text":"Amazing taco & margarita bar open late - serving right up until last call. You can fill out a ticket to build your own tacos any way you choose with lots of options. Build your own tacos are $3 each. Gluten free and vegan options are available too. They serve fresh chips and salsa when you get to your seat. The margs are not too shabby either! I've been to 2 of their Cleveland locations and the service is friendly and quick. Great original Cleveland spot!"}
{"text":"Personally, I think the food is somehow better at the other two locations (Tremont and Lakewood) but really how can you go wrong with three dollar tacos and great margaritas?!"}
{"text":"If you love tacos like I do this is the place to go servers are always great the food is always awesome and they have this jalapeno margarita that is to die for"}
{"text":"I like that Barrio open late night. With tacos, chips and environment, this is one of the best place for dinner......  Brunch on Weekend---great as well  ------Update----- They have changed their hours. Now they open until 1AM....so sad. I wish they would open til2 or 2.30 like they did."}
{"text":"You probably know about Barrio tacos.  They're delicious, cheap \"build your own\" offerings.  However, the Lakewood location has consistently lagged on service & quality compared to their Downtown & Tremont locations.  I love me some Barrio - that's a 5 star joint - but we won't even *go* to the Lakewood location any more."}
{"text":"I'm not nearly cool or hip enough to be a customer of Barrio. Lucky for me, they don't have a policy that prevents me from paying them a visit once and awhile. Barrio is one of those places that's that's just a bit off the more crowded paths of Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood. That's not to say that it's a quiet place to hang out, actually quite the opposite.  On the day of our visit, a Friday, probably about 6:30ish, the place was packed. The inside space is pretty tiny and we had to weave and bob our way through to the hostess. We were happy to find out that there were still a few empty tables out on the patio. Speaking of which, if you are able and the weather's cooperating, sit on the patio. It's one of the best in Tremont.  My first complaint, and I know, it's something I tend to complain about alot in my reviews, is that it was really freakin' loud on the patio. They've got these giant PA system speakers set up outside and I'm pretty sure they were cranked to 11. I'm a firm believer that music, especially in restaurants, should be in the background. It's not a dance club people. I'm sure they do this so that people won't hang around too long.  Next, lets talk about their schtick. Sort of like a Happy Dog for tacos, Barrio has crafted a menu that allows you to build your own tacos from a list of ingredients and toppings. It's basically all they serve aside from a small selection of salsas, guacs and the like. I really dig the concept of keeping it simple but offering essentially unlimited variations on a single theme. The ingredients list is amazing, filled with fresh fixins and just exotic enough to keep it interesting. Oh yeah, and at only $3 each, you can kinda go a little crazy. If you haven't been here before, they've even offered up a selection of pre-designed tacos to help you get started.  Our server busted her ass throughout our time there. I swear I don't think I ever saw her stop moving. The place was busy so we waited a bit for our food order, but we didn't notice too much. The weather was nice, the music was good and our drinks never ran dry. The chips and salsa we had to munch on were just as tasty as all get out. I'm pretty sure they're the reason I could barely finish my third taco.  And the tacos, my god the tacos. These things are among the most amazing things I've ever shoved into my mouth. I didn't even mind the fact that most of the sauces wound up in my beard. Just gave me some for later. Anyway, these things are so damn good. I got the Spicy Sapanaro from the recommended tacos list. That Barrio Sauce, I don't know what's in it, but I need it every day.   The rest were creations of our own that included the Stoner, White Widow and Green Goddess tortillas (a taco encased in a soft flour tortilla, smeared with white queso sauce and then wrapped around a crispy taco? drool) and just about every protein they had on the menu. Get the lengua, trust me. Once you go tongue you'll never go back.  The beer list, while not that large, does offer some great rotating and seasonal craft beer selections from in and around the region. On the eve of our visit I pounced on the chance to sample a Cleveland-brewed beer from Platform Beer Co. called The Juice - a light, refreshing fruit beer that helped to tame the heat from the tacos. Another thing I wasn't too keen on - serving beer in mason jars. C'mon. This trend needs to go away. Craft beer deserves better.  Yeah, we had a pretty damn good experience at Barrio. We're old, so the loud music was bound to irritate and annoy us, and I am a bit of a craft beer snob so the glassware thing was a small thorn in my side, but the food, those tacos, I could eat them every day of my life. Great service, friendly and attentive even at their busiest.  I'm pretty sure they'll be seeing us again soon. Ole mis amigos. Ole indeed."}
{"text":"This is THE restaurant for tacos!! I come here all the time. I have brought all my friends here to try the tacos and everyone says they are the best. One of my friends even said that barrio's tacos were better than tacos he had in mexico...  Not only are the tacos bomb the price is great! $3 for a taco?? Yes please. Any time I go out to dinner with my friends they ask if we can go to Barrio. You have to go here if you're in the area, even if you aren't in the area go here!!! It's worth it"}
{"text":"BEST TACOS EVER. You know what's better than building your own tacos and smothering it in queso? NOTHING.   Salsas are fresh and delicious, the chips are warm (and bottomless), queso is fucking life, and the margaritas pack a punch!   There are so many options to knock your tacos out of this world! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"WHAT IS BETTER THAN TACOS AND TEQUILA?   NOTHING.   ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.   Well, maybe queso too, but Barrio has some bomb ass queso.   You can create your own tacos, or you can choose from a few menu suggestions. I suggest creating your own.   Service is always super friendly and top notch. They're also not super stingy over water refills like the Barrio in Lakewood, and your glasses will always stay full."}
{"text":"Frozen margarita machine is always broken at the Tremont location. At the steep price they charge for a marg you would think they could afford to replace it. Get it together barrio!"}
{"text":"Though it was a busy Friday night and the Indians were playing down the street, we were seated in a timely fashion. The young hostess was not as pleasant as she could have been.  Our waitress was prompt in taking our order.  On to food- the restaurant's 2 strengths were the guacamole and mixed drinks. Chips and salsa come with every order. My friend had a marigold margarita which was delicious and mixed so well that several would have gone down easily.  After that, the food was marginal at best. Being from Milwaukee, we are used to great Mexican American cuisine. The tacos had excessive salsa/liquid running out of them and were very salty but did not have much flavor beyond the salty taste.  Tortillas were definitely bought not homemade. We both ordered rice and these very tiny servings (roughly 2 tbsp) were served for $1 each. Rice is cheap and the rice was plain... there should have been much more rice!!!  The side of beans we ordered tasted love Je they were from the can.  If you're looking for good drinks, this place is a go. This place did not have good tacos-especially if you're familiar with Bel Air in MKE.  I would not go to this restaurant for food again."}
{"text":"This place is so good! We're not from here and I'm truly going to miss it once we leave. However if you get the frozen margarita you won't taste the liquor, so definitely get on the rocks. The patio is gorgeous and the food is delicious and I highly recommend it! Try the chorizo, the Greek goddess shell, and the cilantro lime aioli sauce!!! Did I mention it's only $3 a taco"}
{"text":"Love love love Barrio! I prefer Lakewood locale in the winter and the Tremont location in the summer (amazing patio!).  Admittedly, I'm a bit of a picky eater... the insanely customizable ordering process allows me to get just what I want!   Margaritas are to die for, too."}
{"text":"Out in Cleveland on a business trip and wanted to try something away from the hotel... stumbled upon this cool place and wasn't disappointed. 7pm, no wait time... Drinks were decent. The only complaint, if you even wanna call it that, was that the waitress assumed we knew how to order in the do it yourself order sheet. She kinda explained, but I think we just rolled with it and picked a bunch of stuff. Turned out to be pretty good tho. Nice environment and cool music. Will be back when we visit Cleveland again."}
{"text":"I'm really torn with this review... The food is great, and the drinks are better. I wanted to review Barrio because it is a very popular place (well deserved, too), but I am a picky eater when it comes to certain things. With that being said, there are several items on the menu that I would like to try, but cannot. Therefore, my tacos seem to taste the same every time without being able to expand my menu choices. If you are a picky, like me, check the menu out beforehand... You'll find something to enjoy, but it might be sub-par... If you are not a picky eater (lucky!) then you'll love it here."}
{"text":"Awesome vegan tacos!!! Next time I'm in Cleveland I'm there! I wish my stomach was bigger so I could have eaten more!"}
{"text":"If you can describe this place in as little words as possible its \"DIY tacos\". I came here with 4 others on a weekday after work. It was quite busy at the time. I believe they have happy hour specials until 7pm on the weekdays, but only at the bar. I think its $1 or $2 tacos and $4 margaritas.  Anyhow, if you've been to Happy Dog, you'll be familiar with the concept here. You get a piece of paper and you check off a list of toppings you want on your tacos. Then you wait...and wait (it took about 25 mins for the food). While you wait you can order one of their many delicious margaritas. They can be made with house tequila or top shelf. They are served in a mason jar. They tasted pretty good, but don't let the taste fool you, there's quite a lot of alcohol in them!  Back to the tacos. I ordered 3 tacos, beef, pulled pork, and the lamb special ($4). They were all pretty good, but I felt that the lamb special was lacking in toppings and flavor. The beef and pulled pork was pretty delicious. I had them in soft flour tortillas with lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar, medium salsa, and chipotle honey sauce. I patented this combination, so don't steal it!  I will definitely return and go for their happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Such amazing food. However I got seated at the WORST possible table. I am currently squished between the waiting seats and the wall!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Barrio. They're specials are insane. Everything is really good there. I really enjoy it. My experiences are completely different than some of the reviews I read. Perhaps, I'm not expecting the gospel of tacos, and fine dining service. It's a casual, laid back place that serves tacos and margaritas. But yeah, they're super busy, and sometimes you have to wait. I expect that during happy hour, because of their half-off and dollar-off specials.   I seriously really enjoy this place and it's laughable to have read how some people nitpick this place because they don't carry something as trivial as soft corn tortillas. I wish McDonalds would sell curly fries, but they don't, so I eat the fries they serve, and don't let it completely ruin my experience.   Over all of the times I've eaten there, I've only once seen someone's taco missing an ingredient. I was sitting at the bar, they mentioned it to the bartender, who got the manager, who came over and verified they were missing something and had a new, fresh taco made for them super fast. I was really impressed."}
{"text":"I kept seeing mostly good reviews of this place and decided to try it despite the overpriced menu and the few people that were giving honest reviews of the place stating the food was cold and generally just not good.  I felt like I had been ripped off after eating their food.  $3 for a tiny taco no bigger than Taco Bell.  If the taco was hot it probably would have been good.  The issue is it's not just the toppings that are cold, they pull the meat from the refrigeration unit and place the cold meat on the taco as well.  Every single aspect of these tacos are cold.  We tried a few make your own, we tried a few suggested tacos, we tried the tacos of the day, and chips and guacamole.  The tacos I ordered I had good flavor, but like I said were stone cold from the refrigerator when they served them to me.  The taco of the day was an overly sweet steak and potato taco (at least they said it was steak).  It was actually left over grizzle and fat from a steak one of their employees ordered and didn't want to eat.  The guacamole is the nastiest I've ever had.  I don't like baby food consistency to my guacamole which is what they serve.  To top off the baby food guacamole there is absolutely no seasoning to it.  I guarantee even though I live within walking distance to this place, they will never get the chance to rip me off like they did today.  Save your money and go get good tacos at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Cano is the best bartender! Best margaritas! The tacos are amazing! Sat at the bar and had great service! Chips and salsa are to die for!"}
{"text":"Stopped in pretty late after a game.  Good food, the pork belly was jerky style which kinda threw me.  The hipster bartender warned up after a few minutes and recommended a spicy chix taco that rocked.  Good beer selection.  A good addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Took some family down Saturday afternoon (opening weekend) and we had a good experience.  The waitress was polite, took her time to explain, and was attentive.  Like the other Bario's, you create your own tacos from the check list.  They also have some pre-configured ones if you're not feeling creative. Wasn't impressed with the mellon margarita's, but everything else was on point. Guac and Queso were also good.  Only complaint was the chips... seemed every time they brought them out the basket was full of small broken pieces too small for our dips. Complained about it, but subsequent baskets were identical."}
{"text":"Went to Barrio after the Cavs- Knicks game around midnight and I'm so glad i did! What a hip and colorful spot this is for Cleveland night owls! You walk in and you immediately peep the Dia de Los Muertos decor with the large paintings of skulls and Mariachi band skeletons. I knew it was going to be packed due to the game but we were quickly seated in a spacious but quaint corner table. You are immediately given bottomless chips and salsa.  Diners are asked to order via pencil and paper. The menu is very customizable.  Try the frozen mango Margarita! It was perfect. All drinks are served in cute mason jars. I had the El Puerco tacos. $4 each. Really good and semi sweet and filling. All in all, The Barrio is a really cool concept and the food is really worth a try. I want to try their brunch next time."}
{"text":"I tend to only review restaurant if they really make an impression on me, and Barrio definitely did that. I love tacos in all their glorious forms and this place has quite the extensive menu. Their taco suggestion menu is on par, but my favorite is the create-your-own option. I've eaten here when I ate meat, when I was a vegetarian, and even when I transitioned to vegan and I have never been disappointed in what I got. Definitely a must try if you love tacos and margaritas!"}
{"text":"After many people told us to try Barrio while we were in Cleveland, we made our way to the downtown location on a Tuesday night. We called ahead to see if our party of seven would have a hard time getting a table around 7 p.m. and were surprised to hear the restaurant was almost full! I guess everyone really does love Barrio!   When we arrived we sat outside (it was an abnormally nice October night). Our waiter suggested the marigold and the margarita perfecto. I got the margarita perfecto, which was good, and heavy on the Espolon Blanco.   We started out with Los Tres Amigos of  salsa, guac and queso (we weren't messing around). My favorite was the stoner queso and the traditional guac. For my meal I had the El Jefe and the Dirty Taco. The Dirty Taco was wayyy to hot for me and I couldn't finish it, I should have paid more attention to the spicy meter on the side...woops.   Overall, great service and great food! Yum!"}
{"text":"The El Jefe Taco was the best Taco I have ever had. Seriously amazing, plus the waiter was very courteous and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I would rate this as a must if you are in Cleveland. I got a shrimp taco and braised beef. Both were delicious. Fun, laid back place. Two tacos and a specialty margarita was only $13 but the cost is not the draw, those great tacos are! I would have ate more if I could of!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Awesome tacos and drinks. Very good service and will definitely go back. FYI... The ghosts pepper sauce isn't that hot."}
{"text":"Cool and hip. What a unique place with a great selection of good eats. Stopped in on a Friday and it was busy. Very busy. We were seated right away and the waitress knew her stuff. Margaritas were delicious and big. Ordered from the Chefs favorites section. You check off the items you want on a chit and list the quantity you desire. Easy. There are three items worth mentioning:  The Spicy Saparano which is a soft flour taco with chicken, queso fresco. lettuce, tomatoes and their secret sauce. Delicious. El Filadelfia which is a soft taco with steak, portobello mushrooms, peppers, onions, queso fresco and salsa verde. This is their take on a classic! Carne Trozo, a hard shell taco with braised beef, smoked cheddar, lettuce, tomato, cilantro, onion, corn salsa, salsa verde and their secret sauce.  They also feature a taco of the month. Chips and salsa come out hot and fresh. The salsa is thick and tasty. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen-5 stars! I try to keep them for places that have excellent food, good drinks, great customer service, atmosphere and cleanliness. I'm obsessed with the location. I'm pretty sure heaven could be sitting on the patio, drinking a Marigold margarita eating an El Jefe over looking the Q waiting to go to an Indians game."}
{"text":"Love their tacos! Very fresh ingredients and deliciously prepared. They were even good from a food truck as they were running out of ingredients. Their restaurants are ridiculously crowded so be prepared to wait or try to get there at odd times. As good as anything I've had in Mexico and at Rick Bayless's restaurants."}
{"text":"Tacos are ok but my wife loves them! I dont come anymore(been here 20ish times) for tacos, but the margs. are out of this world and queso is Muy Bueno!"}
{"text":"Put a taco and a marg in front of me and I'm a happy camper. I always go for HH, you get $1 off tacos and half-priced margaritas and some specials on other cocktails. Unlimited chips and salsa, but we usually need to ask the serve to bring more. I love splurging the extra dollar for the green goddess shell--guacamole sandwiched between a hard and soft shell. I also really like their shrimp, which is now a constant on the menu (it used to be one of their fish of the day). Tacos are small, but with all the chips, I usually get 1-2 tacos.   They have special pre-made tacos but these are more expensive than making your own custom one--just copy the ingredients on the special tacos into your custom form. It's the exact same thing, just a dollar or two cheaper!  Also been there for brunch as well, and had one of their breakfast tacos. It was good, but I definitely prefer their regular tacos. Next time, I'll try one of their brunch bowls.   This location closes at 1am, and they need to clear the whole room of alcohol I think 30 or 60 minutes before that. As in, they will take away your cups and pitchers at that time. Just be aware of this! They also have a small patio are for when it's nice out!  Free parking in the shared lot behind the store- don't park on the Dave's side. Also metered parking on the street."}
{"text":"We ate at the bar. I have experienced better food it was very average. The special guac had the oddest flavor. Service is the only thing saving this review. The bartenders were very good. Some bartenders seem to not be able to scan the crowd & see customers waiting to order drinks. That was not the case here - they greeted people waiting and did a great job making rounds."}
{"text":"There are not a lot of bars open on a Sunday night in downtown Cleveland, but this place was so we walked in.  Glad we did.  Bartender was pleasant and fast, and the tacos were great.  You write out your order on a form and hand it to the bartender, which is genius!  Will definitely come back next time I am in Cleveland..."}
{"text":"The tacos are ok. I wish the chicken was a bit more seasoned and less smoky. I love the interior design though. The place has cool vibes."}
{"text":"I was there on a business trip. And this was the only place that seemed to be open past midnight on a Thursday night.  The jack and cokes were like 2.50. Amazing price. The tacos were really good as well. I am not sure what taco I ate because I had to many Jack and cokes but I do know they were great. I also really liked their salsa.   Way to go."}
{"text":"Great tacos, margaritas, and the Buffalo chicken queso is amazing.  Have always had decent service and a great time.  The only down side is that it is usually pretty busy when I go and there is a wait but it's always well worth it."}
{"text":"An abomination against god, Beelzebub, and man.  White people owe Mexico yet another apology for this one. How the hell are there multiple locations for this restaurant. Absolutely shameful. Everything tastes like a child getting creative with store bought, pre made taco ingredients. Nothing authentic about it at all. Everything was either too sweet or too salty (including the quacamole). Honestly, don't come here. If you want Ortega brand taco spices, pre shredded bag cheese, and canned beans... go to the supermarket. Nothing is cooked right, and even the tortillas are bad. At 4 bucks a pop, I'd rather get punched in the dick than ever eat here again. The wait stuff is nice and fast, but seriously, the food is worse than vomit. You will like this food if you enjoy being chained up in a basement and hit in the mouth over and over again with a lead pipe. Seriously, cool angst music and sugar skulls don't make food good. What the fuck? There really must not be a god. The most fun we had eating here is trashing the trash food. If you fed it to your dog I would call the ASPCA on you. It is the Chef Boy-r-D of Mexican food, if Chef Boy-r-D was Pietro Manzoni, that artist who pooped in cans."}
{"text":"I don't dislike Barrio, but wasn't a huge win for my group of friends.   First, the place is tiny and fills up super fast. We were seated in the bar at a high-top table, which meant there were people right up against us.  LOVE the concept of create-your-own-taco, and I was quite happy with my choices (pulled pork with cheese, guac, and jicama slaw), but the rest of my group weren't so thrilled. It would have been easier if the server had taken a second to explain the menu sheets. We thought we understood, but when we had a question, she seemed kinda rushed and didn't really answer. We also didn't realize right away that there are two sheets for your order, one for fillings and one for sauces.  On a nit-picky note, we had 5 people (they only have like 2 tables that can seat 5 - it's THAT small), but ther server brought one small basket of chips & salsa. Took 10 minutes to get a second basket. That should have been a given with 5 people.  But, the atmosphere is pretty cool...someone called in \"Hipexican\" in a previous review and I agree. It was definitely on the hipster side. Our bartender also had a porn 'stache - not sure how that fits into this review, but it stands out in my mind. :)  Nice place to try...might head back on a date night, but not with a group of people."}
{"text":"This is my go-to taco place in Cleveland!   Pros: Custom ordered tacos My order: - Tacos: Green Goddess taco, spice rubbed chicken, cilantro-lime rice, chihuahua cheese, lettuce. The green goddess shell is absolutely my favorite, with a perfect balance of queso and quac. The marinated chicken is not too strong, but much better than plain, grilled chicken. 2 tacos is too few for me, but 3 tacos is too much. So I put in a second order of a coca-cola steak taco. It didn't overwhelm me, especially compared to the chicken. It had a tougher feel and the special marinade didn't do it for me. - Blood Orange Frozen Margarita with Sugar on the rim: I love. Classic blood orange margarita. Comes in mason jar.   Barrio definitely sets the bar for \"make your own\" taco places (**cough, cough better than Condados**). The chips and salsa are included, and the restaurant has a better set up of seating with the individual rooms. It helps with the noise, which is a concern because it's always packed at nights. Also, the spice rubbed chicken raises the bar compared to other places.  Cons: I gave it 4/5 stars because... 1. The service is questionable some nights. We waited a long time for our tacos last night. But if you're ok kicking back and working on your margarita for a while, it won't bother you. Also, sometimes the wait staff seems grumpy, but I think that's part of the charm and something you come to expect.  2. The wait. Sometimes there are open tables but the wait is still crazy.  You can get a drink at the bar, but be prepared to fight for a seat or somewhere to stand. The space is busy, packed with patrons, tables, and waitstaff rushing around with tacos.   Pro tip: Sometimes if I am the only one eating quac with the chips, I order a side of quac with my taco (instead of a full order of quac). Then I put a little on my taco and eat the rest with the chips! The perfect amount to satisfy my craving."}
{"text":"The best way I can sum up this experience is by saying that I really didn't want to tell anyone about this place at first. No one. Then I tried the food and drinks and realized that just wouldn't be fair. If you have found this review by randomly looking up information on this place, let me save you a little bit of time. Stop reading reviews, and get there! If you have read this far, you have already missed two minutes of amazing guacamole, queso, salsa, create-your-own tacos and wonderful drinks.  You won't be disappointed. The atmosphere and service matches the high quality of food and drinks served. My personal tip is to try the Barrio secret sauce, which is the house spicy sauce. It goes perfectly with a Rogue Dead Guy Ale, which of course goes even better with the Day of the Dead Murals."}
{"text":"After hearing amazing things about Barrio from my husband, I decided to give it a try and I AM A FAN FOR LIFE! Seriously, Barrio is amazing! But YOU MUST time out your visit because it gets PACKED!!!   I love the way you order your meal... (see pictures)! There is a checklist of options for your tacos to include the kind of tortilla, meat, sauce, condiments etc.   I love love the queso blanco at this restaurant. Make sure to order that in addition to the house salsa!   I really don't think you can go wrong ordering; everything I tried was great! Good luck & enjoy!"}
{"text":"The standard chips and salsa are delicious, but we ordered the chorizo queso which was amazing!! We both had tacos from the suggested menu (I was too scared to try to make my own) and we loved them! I would highly recommend barrio."}
{"text":"Okay, so I love Barrio but this is my least favorite location. The bar area isn't bad. But the dining room is horrible. They have terrible acoustics, so I can never hear the people around me. I'm also not a fan of the patio area. If you are looking for just the food, come to this location. But if you are looking for a good atmosphere, try a different location."}
{"text":"Come prepared for a big crowd, tasty Americanized tacos, great drinks, and delicious queso!  This place is always hoppin with a crowd. I have yet to try happy hour, but the deal is amazing, $2 tacos? They are the biggest tacos too. I can usually get away with just 2, unless I'm really starving then 3 is just right.  They have quite a few beers on tap, lots of specialty drinks. I find the atmosphere warm and cozy and great for either just dinner,  a night of fun at the bar, or both.  Parking is kind of a disaster but if you're lucky you'll find a spot on the street or on one of the side streets, but be prepared to walk a bit."}
{"text":"The chorizo tastes of so much cinnamon.  So I don't order that anymore.  The tacos are great and the ghost sauce is actually hot.  I want tacos now."}
{"text":"I would eat barrio every week if I could. Cheap overstuffed tacos, great drinks and endless amounts of chips and salsa. Get the green goddess wrap and queso. And stop by for happy hour for 3 dollar margaritas and discounted tacos. My favorite taco spot in CLEVELAND."}
{"text":"I don't think there are enough words to describe my love for (or maybe addiction to) Barrio Lakewood. The ingredients are always fresh, and I absolutely love that you can pick all of your own toppings. The house salsa is incredible and my favorite drink is the skinny skeleton (a shot of tequila, triple sec, fresh lime juice and a splash of soda). The service is always good, although occasionally slow if you are in the bar area during happy hour. And did I mention happy hour? Amazing deals, half off margaritas and $1 off tacos. The only downfall is parking, which is problematic throughout Lakewood in general."}
{"text":"My little sister now drags me to Barrio at least once a week. I forgive them their original hipster sins. The food is great and well priced."}
{"text":"I am in the middle of the road about this place. Yes I think it is cool you can create your own taco and they have different toping choices than some places.  This is not the only Mexican place that does this. Are the tacos good, yes they are. My personal opinion is its nothing above and beyond than other establishments. I have been here twice. They do also have tacos that are already built and you can pick from those. One disappointment was I ordered a side of rice and it came in a cup that you get when you get ketchup in. So it was really small. Same thing happened when I ordered a side of beans. I was hoping to get an actual side of rice, not two fork fulls. The margaritas are not over powering either, we ordered a pitcher once and we both got two or more drinks out of it and we did not even feel anything. Happy hour is  a good deal but its only available in the bar, if you can find room or a seat."}
{"text":"The vibe is urban hipster and trendy, the drinks were very watery and the service was slow.  Their peach guacamole was top notch and tacos are customized to every extent !! May come again !!"}
{"text":"Nice location but wish it had outdoor seating. First things first, the margaritas are delicious (though maybe a taaad on the weak side). I love the Jade Olmec!! The house marg with Jack Daniels is ok as well. Now, the tacos are amazing! Don't be fooled, these aren't your ordinary tacos! You have an abundance of meats and toppings to choose from to make your own or you can order some of the specials .. All good! Queso is good! Guac is good!   I will return just for margs and chips and salsa!!"}
{"text":"I want to give more stars because the food was almost excellent. The problem was SALT! Most of the food was so salty we could barely eat it. The tomato salsa especially. We had to leave the last bowl of it because it was inedible. Please tone down the salt so we can come back because the food was otherwise delicious."}
{"text":"I loved barrio, it was my second of three dinners for my one night in Cleveland! The build your own taco is a great way to order!"}
{"text":"Soooo good...couldn't find a Mexican place in Cleveland for my life and this place looked casual and quick so we tried it. And it was BOMB."}
{"text":"This place is so quaint & trendy. Love the decor. The service was horrible, but management makes a definite effort to correct. Which makes me want to give a 2nd chance. We ordered smoked trout guacamole and it was ok. Once you get beyond the trout, bacon, etc the guac itself was bland. As for tacos; all inclusive was good. They definitely like to smoke their fish & meat @ Barrio. Hasta la Vista was yummy. Prices are more than reasonable!  Can't argue that. Hopefully next time around, we will get a food network worthy experience from Barrio."}
{"text":"Delicious. Especially the queso dip for the tortillas and the cilantro lime sauce on the tacos."}
{"text":"First off, tacos were great! 3 tacos filled me up to the max. I love the salsa!! Had a chipotle smoke to it and it was delicious!   House margaritas did the job just right.  Our waitress was super busy and I totally understand her frustration...however I asked for 3 different tequilas to and they were out of all them.  This bothers me. Inform the wait staff, cross them off the list. Do something other than waste my time."}
{"text":"I'm going to write this review with a disclaimer: I am from Texas.. the land of the best tacos in the world (challenge me, I dare you). Now it might not be fair to rate a taco restaurant in land where people think people in Mexico eat daily at Chipotle, but this restaurant tries to present itself as a legit taco eatery. As such, I'm about to keep it real.   My BIGGEST complaint... the tortillas are NOT made in house. They taste like an employee picked them up at Target on their way in to work. The queso (a TexMex delicacy) was disgusting... not even worth calories. The Salsa might be flavorful and spicy by Ohio standards, but to me it may as well had been Ragu. Finally, the guac was pretty bland (shameful).   If you're looking for a few decent drinks and maybe some light mexican cuisine in Treemont and nearby, this is the place for you. If you're looking for some legit tacos to hit the spot, I'd go ahead and stop by the grocery store and prepare to DIY."}
{"text":"this place has bangin' tacos. there's a whole bunch of options, including brunch tacos with fried eggs, and even a DIY menu where you construct your own own. you speak my language, Barrio.  chimichurri-marinated steak taco + fried egg +avocado = awesome hangover cure. the El Jefe (chorizo AND chicken within a hard shell with a soft shell around it) was also excellent.  the menus are pieces of paper that you fill out with a pencil. simple and effective. prices aren't bad, averaging 4 or 5 bucks each for a sizable taco. since you can add on to the menu defaults or make your own, it's really up to you.  the bacon bloody Mary was delicious. a nice slab of thick-cut bacon made extra-crispy is the centerpiece of this drink. and it moderate kick to it in terms of both spice and potency.  outdoor dining on a warm day, with tacos and booze in hand, with your family. you just can't beat that."}
{"text":"Very good food and perfect portions. Love all of the customization options. The margarita options are wide and all of the flavors I have tried have been delicious. The only downside to this spot is that the restaurant can get a bit loud at times."}
{"text":"Barrio has the best guacamole in Cleveland.  I have never tried any guacamole better than this. The tacos are good. I've had tacos with meat and also vegetarian tacos and they are all bomb. The only con I would say would be they do not offer happy hour options."}
{"text":"It was national taco day yesterday so it was most appropriate to try Barrio. Ordering from the checklist menu is a bit confusing, the selections looks great, but a unless you really know food it might be hard to pair the flavors all together.  I could see someone ending up with a big mess.  I ordered a chicken taco on a corn tortilla- the tortilla was cold and the chicken was kinda dry.  The braised beef taco with chipolte honey sauce was better but not amazing.  We also had the queso if the day which was mac n cheese- kinda weird- we think hints of nutmeg in it?  I guess I would go back for a happy hour.  We sat at the bar- and the service as OK, but again not great."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. So many creative taco options! Or you can keep it simple too. That's the best part, it's totally up to you! The hard part is remembering what you had last time and what combos you really love. Usually a decent beer selection. Service is sometimes slow - but I think that's just because they understaff for how busy they are. Also they get a 6th star from our dog Oscar for their dog friendly patio."}
{"text":"I got food from their food truck yesterday at the Fabulous Food event at the IX Center.  The food was not only unappetizing in appearance and awful in taste, but it made me sick.  After waiting in line over 30 minutes,  the three taco -- chicken, pork, and mushroom-veggie -- were all served at room temperature - a health hazard - and the soft shells were all saturated with greasy water.  The pork and chicken were mediocre and tasteless. The veggie taco, after looking at it I didn't even have the appetite to eat it. I picked at it and it tasted awful.  My stomach has been hurting for over 18 hours now, I have made at least 10 trips to the toilet and I can't hold down food.  In summary, one of the worst meals I've had in years and the first case of gastroenteritis (possibly food poisoning) in over 20 years. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good build-your-own tacos with amazing Caribbean drinks. Try their slaw with pulled pork on corn tortillas. Also the guacamole rocks!"}
{"text":"Cool little bar with a great atmosphere and good food.  Started with chips, salsa and chorizo queso. Good tasting salsa, queso was good because of the chorizo.  They have a taco list to select from or build your own.  I had Coke marinated steak.  Very good overall.  Said they had Carolina Reaper sauce, but really, its habanero and not that hot, only reason I gave them a downgrade to 4 stars"}
{"text":"Went last year with some girlfriends as the one girl is a bit obsessed with it. After our dinner here we did go back late night for some more on that trip. Just delicious.   More recently went in August with my boyfriend who is VERY picky.  The customization allowed us to enjoy exactly what we want. I mean I have to get BACON on every taco. Not only did the picky significant other enjoy the place, but when we were wondering what to eat the following day he described his hunger by how many Barrio tacos he could eat. I sadly had to advise him they aren't open for lunch. Will definitely return every time I'm in Cleveland. Now if only we could get them to put a location in Buffalo, NY..."}
{"text":"I went here during the Indians World Series game 6. It had a great vibe and the service was pretty impressive considering how busy it was. The tacos here are made to order and very reasonable prices. It's a bit loud and there is s TV is every direction so for this night, it was perfect. Most of the time I would have found it distracting. If you want good tacos or Mexican food, I would suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I LOVE barrio. Usually. Tonight my visit was problem after problem. We came to see a comedy show and right away it was a run around. They claimed my friends had to sit at a table outside the show to order, while I had no problem sitting down in the show and getting served. I tried to track down the server to change their orders to our table in the show and he gave me attitude about the table number even though we were standing literally next to it. When my friend went back to her old table THEY LEFT HER CREDIT CARD standing there at the empty table in plain sight. They didn't give us chips and salsa and I can usually forgive that- but when they finally DID get the chips they didn't give us salsa and we were not about to share old salsa that the table before us had left behind. And even after that, they STILL dropped the tacos at the EMPTY TABLE with no belongings. So confusing! From now on I will stick to Tremont."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to back and back again. I stumble upon this place while visiting family in Ohio and they knew of this great Mexican restaurant to get amazing tacos. Since I love tacos, my lady and I decided to go. The place is nice and spacious an definitely crowded (of course) due to it popularity. The way to order, one gets a sheet with different styles of making your own tacos. After you select what you want, you give it to your waiter and behold, delicious tacos. The tacos are amazing, juicy and flavorful. Overall, next time we go to Cleveland, Barrio is going to be our stop to eat."}
{"text":"create your own tacos!! super yummy. the green goddess tortilla was phenomenal - how can you not love queso!? our server was the sweetest girl ever and took great care of us. to the cute vegan girl with bangs and long brown hair, thank you :) we thought the blood orange margs were delicious! would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"While Barrio was good and everything about it was good, I wouldn't say that it's the best taco I've ever had.   We went on a Saturday night and thankfully, we didn't have to wait too long. We were seated and our waitress so so friendly and attentive. They have a \"build your own taco\" check list and it was easy to figure out! I was pretty bummed that they didn't have soft corn tortillas since I really don't like flour tortillas, or hard corn tortillas, so I went with a taco Bowl. The waitress looked over our taco selections and said, \"Great Choice!\" or something of the variation to all of us. It made me feel like, \"oh yea! I made the right taco choice.\" lol   We also got \"stoner queso\" which is melty white cheese, but they add rice in it. I'm still indifferent on how I feel about adding the rice. It did make it thicker and I could really scoop that cheese on my chips, but then again, it was just rice... I don't know.   Unfortunately, the kitchen was backed up and I regrettably continued to say, \"yea! Sure we will take more chips!\" until I ate so many chips, but stomach was not having it! The dinner came and I ate it, but I suffered through the rookie mistake of eating too much chips.   I will give it another try since I feel like the combinations are really endless! I'd like to try more! The bathroom was small but clean. The sinks have a \"faux rock\" look to them and the faucets were cute. I enjoy small features like that!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The only thing is that it's really loud and usually really crowded especially for happy hour but the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very nice.  It's definitely a place that I will continue to frequent. Also, the tacos are very good!"}
{"text":"I'm ok with the 45 min to an hour wait for a table but I'm not ok with waiting 25 minutes for a drink at the bar.  There didn't seem to be enough servers circulating around the place, glad we left and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I eat here about twice a week since they've opened their doors. The tacos are delicious! First you chow down on some complementary chips and salsa while sipping on a pint of good craft beer. Then order the tacos. I recommend 2 since they're very filling, and I'm a big guy. One of them needs to be the pescado de dia. Last time it was cornflake crusted mahi mahi and before that was seared swordfish. There are not many places you can order great tacos for only $3 each. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I have never been to the Barrio in Tremont, but decided to give this place a try since I live in Lakewood and heard good things. I must say, I was very impressed!   A place that specializes in tacos only...genius. I like the way they give you pads of paper and you're able to create-your-own taco or if you're feeling indecisive, they have a list of \"specialty tacos\" to choose from. I was feeling indecisive this past week and went with the Spicy Saponara (my favorite!) and the Dirty Taco, also very good.   They have many different types of margaritas you can select from. We went with the house margarita and thought it was great. Not too sugary, not too sweet, just right. I've also had the skinny margarita which is my favorite. My friend tried the mint margarita that is like a mojito-margarita, yum!    They also have different salsas, quesos and guacamoles that you can choose from, but we weren't starving to begin with, so it would've been too much.   They do give you free chips and regular salsa, which should be expected at a mexican restaurant, but not always the case. The salsa tasted fresh and not like it was out of a jar and the tortilla chips were perfectly fried.   I'm excited to go back and try more of the stuff on the menu. Love the concept here. Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Where did hipsters eat before Lakewood's Barrio opened? Barrio is a perfect addition to the Lakewood food scene.  A huge variety of tacos, great salsa and guac and a great tequila, whiskey and craft beer selection!  Usually a good crowd, sometimes packed at peak hours.  Love this play and definitely worth checking out!    Even though I'm a carnivore the black bean taco is great/possibly my favorite.  They have build your own so all tastes accounted for as well as veggie options.    Tacos are $3-$4, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"So good. I mean it. We came in at 10:30 PM and were seated immediately. The drinks came promptly and our food order went in shortly after. The build your own menu is wonderful. I ordered 4 tacos and was only able to finish 2. They were even really good the next day. The chips and salsa were a highlight. Super smoky flavor had us eating thru 3 refills. Excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Sorry Cleveland but this joint just doesn't hang with other similar places in the country.  Someone mentioned in a review about Condado in Columbus and said Barrio is better. I wholly disagree. Our barrio tacos were mediocre. The margaritas were mediocre (house marg is wayyyy too sweet and the 'skinny version' is super bland).  Service was fine.  I'm sure for a late night drinking adventure, this place is great. But sans buzz, this is just ok."}
{"text":"I like this place! I personally think that they're put together made to order tacos taste better than making your own. They have great guacamole and it's a pretty big bowl of guac versus the usual. I like the restaurant and the food was good but nothing where I am head over heels. But it's perfect for a late night bite!"}
{"text":"Our second visit to the new Barrio in Willoughby was a little disappointing. We went for happy hour on a Friday in Lent, knowing they had some good non-meat options as well as phenomenal queso. We arrived around 3:45 PM and asked to sit in the bar area. The hostess shared that we could sit anywhere, so we chose a table next to the bar. However, another hostess came to the table and shared that these tables were to be seated by the hostess, but she would let us sit there. There was only one other table occupied at that time. Our waitress came to the table a few minutes later and indicated that we would have to wait 10 more minutes for happy hour, which was fine as she did bring chips and water and we also ordered queso to go along with the salsa. We waited almost 20 minutes for her to return and then placed our drink and taco order. The tacos were good, though a little slim on the apple slaw, which is one of my favorite parts of the taco. I ate far too much queso and the waitress refilled our chips several times. Overall, it was good, not great, hopefully they will continue to improve."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Cleveland with some friends for a Cleveland Indians baseball game. When speaking with a street vendor, he suggested that we try Barrio. So, after getting twisted around town and a little lost, we finally found it. It was very crowded and I fell in love with the feel of the place. I thought it would be the greatest experience, but it was not the case.   First, the waiter was very irritated that we didn't know the ordering procedures. He temper was short and was not very helpful. We've never been to a Barrio and didn't know that you had to fill out an order form.   I did like the fact that you could either chose tacos that were predetermined or you can build your own. The taco come in soft or hard. The toppings are endless and were fresh and delicious. A bit on the small side, so maybe order more than one.   But the place was hopping and the seating was collective, spacious and comfortable. I loved the painting on the walls and the feel of the Mexican spirits and skeletons. It was very different and something very unique.   The place attracted a younger crowd but was not uncomfortable for the \"older\" crowd.   The bar area was large, bright and festive looking. The energy of the place definitely sparked from this area. I'm not a drinker, but if I were, that is where I would have been.   The one thing about eateries in the center of town is the parking, especially before a baseball game or any event. We had to pay $25 just for parking. That did suck, but we were going to the game- so that was a plus. If we were not going to the game, I don't think we would have paid the parking just to go eat. I guess planning is a big deal when going  here to eat.   Would I go back and try it again? YES!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are our favorite. So affordable for custom tacos that are so good every single time. The pork and braised beef are our favorites, and all the toppings are worth trying! The guacamole is spot on and could never be duplicated."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and very reasonably priced. Many different flavor combinations to choose from for everyone. The only downside, and a big one, is don't try showing up when they are busy as you will not get in and the staff will not give you a wait time, while being rude I might add. Very pompous and full of themselves is how I would describe them when they are busy. I must add that I have only experienced this at their tremont location only a few times."}
{"text":"Taco options are interesting/nice twist but the taste is not all that impressive.  Overall service was lackluster."}
{"text":"Barrio's tacos are the \"revelations about life\" type. Absolutely amazing food and it's unbelievably cheap (2-5$/taco).   The wait staff is fun and upbeat. Ticket times are pretty short and the food comes out a good temperature.   Selection is great especially for parties of mixed carnivores, veggie burglars, and vegans. Almost all of the tacos can be mixed and matched to cater to specific diets or food allergies.   Definitely a regular place we love to go and will continue taking our out of town guests there as a \"welcome to Cleveland's food scene.\"  Note: you can expect to wait a minimum of an hour and a half, however it is worth the wait and there is pretty much always a wait."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a reason to go to Barrio. This is one of my favorite places in Cleveland!!  I love the create your own tacos as well as their suggestions. The tofu bits are delicious and their pumpkin guacamole is the strangest yet most delicious dip ever. I love how vegetarian friendly this place is.  They have tasty strong margaritas as well.  The inside can get a little loud, but the patio is so enjoyable during the summer time.  I even had my birthday dinner here.  This is the place to go if you're looking for a reasonably priced foodie taco experience."}
{"text":"Everyone loves to build there on taco and drink margaritas. This is the place to go. Little Hint watch out for the Bario secret sauce can be a little spicy."}
{"text":"I've gone to Barrio for years! The best thing you can do for yourself is spend a happy hour here. $2 tacos can't be beat anyplace else.   I recommend the Jame-o-rita. It's not a happy hour option but if you're already receiving $2 tacos you can splurge on the rita.   My last visit was for Cindo de Mayo. I was apprehensive that we'd get a seat fast, especially during happy hour. But they sat us in less than 15 minutes.   OOh, and dare I add - GREAT people watching. I saw (and heard) a couple fight, she walked out on him, and he didn't even run after her. He just sat there and continued to eat his taco. (Which means the tacos must REALLY be THAT good.)   Priceless. Go for the people watching."}
{"text":"Great vibe, food, and service! Friends were raving about it, so we couldn't pass it up. A little small, but they got us right in and we very accommodating to our 6 month old. You wouldn't think it would be a good place to take a baby/kids, but they have highchairs and the group behind us also had kids with them. As for the food- you can't beat the price for the quality! We opted for the make your own tacos which was really fun mixing and matching flavors. The menu also looked good with lots of variety to choose from. Great drinks to top it all off. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"There is nothing like a great Barrio taco, or two... or three... Good god! I love the fact they have one of my fave meads (Zombie Killer, if you're asking) and have a wide variety of craft beer options."}
{"text":"Cool place. Fast service. Great experience. Unfortunately the salsa was a bit too hot for me but it was complimentary so I cant complain too much!!! & the guac was a bit too salty for me. Salsa verde was amazing though!"}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us went to Barrio last night. The patio had one other group on it. The hostess sat us at two tables since there were a lot of us. We all ordered food, appetizers, and drinks. We were having a great time, minus the fact that every time she got into our line of vision, she gave us all dirty looks. After our tacos came out, she had the audacity to come up to our second table and tell our friends she needed to seat people there, so they had to move. EXCUSE ME? Who seats someone, mean mugs them, and then tells you to move in the middle of a meal. Needless to say, we will not ever be going back there. I'd rather spend $100 at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Round 1: we go in on a Monday night, and only have to wait for about 5 minutes for a table to be cleared for us. We each order a drink and some queso for the table, everything shows up pretty quickly, and we each order 2 tacos using the create-your-own sheets on the table. During our wait, a group of four fratty lookin' dudes at the next table shouted commentary at people outside (on the other side of the windows they must not have noticed were there) and swigged cheap happy hour beer like they'd never been allowed out without their moms before. We ignored how loud and annoying they were being (constantly screeching out catchphrases over and over, then giggling like fifth grade girls at the lunch table in the cafeteria, glancing around to see how many other diners they'd been successful at annoying). It was like being transported back to when The Mask came out and every idiot dude you knew was going around saying SMOKINNNNN over and over. Gawwwd. We were glad when our tacos came out because we intended to eat and get the eff out of there, as we hadn't expected to sit in the middle of an all-out drunk bro-down. So the tacos came, and we each took a bite.  We were not even through chewing that first bite when the guy closest to us put his feet on the bottom rungs of his bar stool, lifted himself up off the seat, then bared down and proceeded to let the loudest, longest, bubbliest fart I have ever heard in a public place rip out of his precious asshole. He was directly in my line of sight so I sat there, dumbfounded and staring, bits of taco bite in my mouth. Then this dude cups his hands and starts FANNING HIS FART IN OUR DIRECTION. Laughter, oh rampant, unbridled joy escapes the rest of The Brothers Frat and they struggle to hide smarmy smiles behind shitty $2 beers as we sit there completely agape, the taste of tacos now hideously intermingled with the rotten egg smell of this guy's guts. I can tell you now, whoever that dude is, he needs to think about changing his diet. (I would also suggest re-thinking the strategy of wearing both backwards hat AND backwards sunglasses resting on bill of backwards hat...both of these things are meant to be worn facing forward, Toddmeister, protecting the front of your head from the sun, neither are doing much for your neck, which was, oddly enough, quite red.)  We flagged down our waitress, paid our check and got the hell out of there, leaving half full drinks and entire tacos behind, as the fart smell and the laughter were not dissipating. I hate to be all \"never in my life\" about things, but oh my god, I've never had to smell someone's asshole in the drive through of a damn McDonald's where you'd expect lower standards, but to have some drunk idiot assault me with the noxious fumes from his rancid butthole while I drink an $8 cocktail in a restaurant where people are at least expected to excuse themselves if they need to shit their pants, it was just too much. \"Hey, farts are talent\" The Toddmeister said to our backs as we left, which is not even a complete sentence.  Turns out, I wasn't missing much. Round 2: Went to the other location with coworkers and tried to place my same order again. I hadn't noticed the first time around (probably because of the fart attack??) that no matter what fillings you order for your custom taco, the majority of what comes in the taco is about a half to 3/4 cup of white rice, not mentioned anywhere on the order form. White. Rice. Who puts white rice on tacos?! Poor people, that's who. It's so they can get away with putting about 2 tablespoons of whichever protein you ordered under that rice. \"What a huge taco, and for only three dollars!\" you say. \"I am getting such a deal!\" Maybe you are, if some giggling, whitebread tit isn't forcing you to smell his flatulence while you eat ball after ball of sticky Minute Rice and tortillas. Either way, I thought it was flavorless and gross, though the farting added a bonus layer to the grossness.  2 stars because the drinks were not bad, just expensive for what they were, and obviously nobody is keeping an eye on the kids during happy hour. Maybe we should just nail the door to the BOYZ ONLEEY clubhouse shut so they can choke on their own gases."}
{"text":"Barrio is ok.  I'm not sure if these guys know what they're getting themselves into by opening another location on Madison Rd, probably about as good an idea as opening an ice factory in the depths of hell, but not my call.  The first time I went I had to leave because the hostess said that there would be an undisclosed wait time. The second time, I got in quickly.  The tacos are good, they are not amazing. They are not worth $4 a piece, by any means. But the genius that the Barrio team employ is that surely people will get goonface wasted and $4.00 won't seem like such a bad price when you're drunk and hungry. And with the smaller sized taco, you could probably smash down at least three in a drunken haze, in addition to racking up a monster booze tab. Well played.  I wanted to give this place more stars, everybody seems to really love it. When I heard the \"Portlandia\" theme playing over the speakers and I got really depressed and knew that it would cost them at least one star. Cleveland as an East Coast fixed gear mecca is a sad thought. I told Denny I'd save them from deuces just because she likes it, so Barrio you are on thin ice with me!   Their tofu game is rough, if you're vegetarian definitely try to avoid it. The sauces and other toppings are pretty good though."}
{"text":"Great Tacos!!  Cheap on Tuesdays, but packed to the hilt.  Can get in and out for about $10/person (unless you drink a lot)"}
{"text":"There is very little that I can say in this review that will make you understand what Barrio is all about.  You've either been there or you haven't...and if you haven't, hurry up already!    This Cleveland gem has gained popularity in recent year and is currently about to open it's 4th location.  I'll just keep it simple and say the tacos are something else.  You custom make your own taco by filling out the pencil and paper form.  If you don't want to do the work, choose one of their speciality tacos.  They will have a special Guacamole almost daily (at least every day that I've ever been there) and it all starts with an incredible fresh guac and gets creative and funky from there.    Make sure to pair your food with one of the excellent margaritas served in fitting mason jars to match the atmosphere.    Lastly, don't dare leave without eating a choco-taco.  There are two versions, vanilla and cayenne.  They are both the same with the latter simply adding a nice element of heat to your cool dessert.    Anyway, it doesn't matter which of the locations you head to as they are all consistent and give the same feel.  They also have a spot in Progressive Field which is more incentive to head to a Tribe game while in town."}
{"text":"Came to Barrio after hearing great reviews of this place. Located right near the Q and Progressive Field, it's a popular place to hit up before games so it can get crowded. When we came not during a game day, we were seated within 5 minutes. They have plenty of seating and a really nice open bar space for happy hour. Loved that you can customize your tacos with whatever ingredients that you want. We tried their house margarita which tasted strong and delicious! I was expecting small tacos so I ordered three however, I was surprised at how big the tacos were! I was full after my first one (after eating a bunch of complimentary chips and dip) that I had to take two of them home. Will definitely have to try their happy hour sometime!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here as a random walk-in. Oh my goodness I love this place. We've been back several times. You are seated, then you check off what you would like on the menu cards on the table. They have options for every kind of appetite or dietary restriction at very fair prices.   I hope you like sugar skulls living all kinds of lives because they are painted in murals all over the walls doing various things like riding horses and getting married."}
{"text":"So you have to build your taco and there's relatively small menu (all taco too). I wish they offered more options other than taco. The food in itself was good but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Cleveland. Moist and flavorful, never lacking spice ave texture. Amazing quesoand margaritas. Only complaint is the wait and the effort to park. Try the pulled porkwith the pineapple salsa, and the dirty taco for sure, and don't skip the guac. Lots of veggie options too, and they ever make to-go a plausible option, mine didn't even get soggy. The servers are quick and accurate."}
{"text":"Great place! If you're looking for a taco spot this is definitely it. Barrio does fully customizable tacos with an array of different ingredients ( havent tried them all but very tasty). Dare I say the food also seems relatively healthy so thats a plus. Ive always loved the service as well. The patio is a place to be for summertime. When I think Tremont I think Barrio. Also not bad on the wallet! 5stars"}
{"text":"Where to begin....? of course we showed up on a Friday night with no reservation. So we were expecting to get on a wait list. No problem right? 40 minute wait? Sure. My friend and I went on to the Chocolate bar and had a couple of drinks while the wait time flew by. 40 minutes passed and no call yet, so we walked back only to find out that we had to wait an additional 45 minutes!!!   Fast forward, our waitress was AWESOME! I wish I could remember her name. I remember her having a short cut style with blonde-ish hair. Service was up to par. The margarita pitcher was fabulous. A little pricy though. But it was enough for at least 4 people. The street tacos are great, must try the steak with the red salsa and cheese!. The chorizo though? That was a bit of a disappointment. It had no flavor to it. I felt like I was having ground beef or something... just too dry for my taste. I tried to add some salsa and it was just no help.  If you ask for a side of rice, expect to receive a 4oz soufflé cup :) just FYI. If I were to come back to Cleveland I'd probably swing by this place again. I'd probably not wait and hour and some though. Lol. Stars are for service and margarita!!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, if I lived in the area I'd eat here all of the time. Hands down best tacos in the world. That is all."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is very popular in Cleveland - but don't both going to other places because this place has the best tacos every DAY for an exceptional price. The flavor and abundance of toppings is unmatched. They also have a kick ass beer selection (I'm not a margarita or drinks kinda girl) with Rogue, Lagunita's and others on tap I've never heard of as well as a large variety of off the beaten path types in bottle and can. As far as the atmosphere and design it's like day of the dead/hipster-ish with some very unique pieces. My boyfriend and I described how we would take their angle on design with our new place - go around collecting at various places and just have at it!  We highly enjoyed the entire experience as it was fun to pick your own toppings, taco shells and more! Enjoy the combinations you dream up."}
{"text":"The only visit I had at this location was an afternoon when there was both an Indians and Cavs playoff game at the same time (1pm) on a Sunday. The place was swamped so we had to wait for a table, but overall I thought the service and quality of the food was excellent considering how busy they were. I selected 2 of the house tacos, which was more than enough food for me. You can also build your own if that's more your speed. Lengthy beer list and good cocktails, everything I felt was priced reasonably."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the decorations and painting ok the wall! So unique. Their food is amazing and the tacos are massive! Hahah I'm full off of just 1!"}
{"text":"Barrio is an awesome restaurant & bar.  My buddies and I were recently in downtown Cleveland, exploring the city when we came across Barrio. The wait was wild, but we decided to stick it out because the food must have been good.  Similar to a Condado (central Ohio's version of Barrio), customers create their own tacos. Each taco stands at about $3-$4 each. Various meats and a wide selection make this place a fun experiment. The chorizo was my personal favorite.  Our server was condescending since we'd never been there and were very curious on what to do. Because of her attitude, I knocked this down to a 4-star review, but other than that I have no complaints. Really solid place."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a drink to kill some time. My husband says this was the best salsa he's ever had.  The classic margarita I ordered was great and pretty cheap which was great! Huge round bar inside and looks like it had a great build your own taco menu. We didn't stay for food but would definitely return!"}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about barrio is the fact that they don't have real authentic Mexican food. It's an Americanized version of Mexican. Like a hipster Taco Bell. No lengua. Breaks my heart. No soft shell corn tortillas. Boo.   This is isn't to say that their food isn't good. It is. It's just not authentic."}
{"text":"great mexican food, some of the best in cleveland. love the menu style of a notepad and being able to customize exactly what you want! queso is great, definitely try the white widow style tacos, they're fantastic. also stellar service and they do a great job of moving people in and out quickly and efficiently. can't wait to go back to try their margaritas and guac!"}
{"text":"So...I came here a lot, like a lot a lot. Mainly for two reasons:  1. Amazing happy hour (raise your hand if you're a starving student)  2. And friends loved it.    So the first time I came here I loved it. Even though I piled on way too much and my taco was mush (I can get carried away with tasty options). I was also intrigued by the whole theme of the restaurant and great prices.   Second time I came here, I began noticing things I didn't like. Did I mention mushy tacos? Well yeah, kept happening with fewer and fewer ingredients. But like who wants a plain taco?! (Def not me)   Also their guac is super salty and has no onions or cilantro. Uhm Mr. Barrio, this isn't guac okay?!  Third time I came here, well...you get the picture...  Prepare to wait on busy nights or on the peak of HH. Although, like I said, prices are amazing and food isn't bad. Definitely worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Cleveland and the prospect location is my favorite. Fast and friendly service, rather spacious and love the decor. The El Jefe is my favorite taco on the menu and they come up with some pretty kick ass specials each month. The chicken and waffle taco was divine and I loved the peach guac they had last month. Margaritas are great and they have a full bar as well. Overall, this is my go-to spot. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.   I wish we had one in columbus.  Omg everything was Good  i still think about the tacos.  Will definitely recommend and go again.  The guacamole was amazing the salsa had a sweet taste to it.  I love the option of you building your own food."}
{"text":"I came in on a Friday night and the server I had was well below average. My beer was like warm actually my tacos were colder than my beer. Some dude came and plopped my tacos on the table and she casually turned and said those are your tacos. Never showed back to my table I had to hunt for a manager to get my check."}
{"text":"Their food is great but service is slow and gets crowded with long wait times. Their prices and portion sizes are wonderful though! MUST TRY THEIR QUESO--best stuff ever!!!"}
{"text":"Usually  I am a huge fan of Barrio, but on this day it was a horrible experience. Stopped in for an after work happy hour with my wife. They have a great happy hour. There service was horrible, though. We ordered Queso and after 25 minutes we asked our bartender if it was coming, and she told us she forgot to put it in. 20 minutes later it still had not arrived, and we asked for the check. It was not on the check, and she never said anything about it. We were there for two hours and were only able to get two drinks."}
{"text":"Great tacos!!! My wife and I had drinks and tacos before a concert here. The employee working behind the bar had no idea how to change the channel or any relevance of sports."}
{"text":"So happy we stopped here while visiting Cleveland. The best margaritas we have ever had. The food was awesome and the prices were very reasonable. If your in the area you won't be sorry you stop."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and I think it's an A-Okay place. I like the special queso, salsa, and drinks, but I have had better tacos and I didn't care for the regular guac. During happy hour tacos are a dollar off so while they might not be the best tacos I've ever had you can still fill up for a decent price. Also nice that you can build your tacos just the way you like. You can choose from various meets, sauces, cheeses, etc.   This place is usually busy and a lot of people love it, and maybe you might too, I just think it's a bit overhyped. Again, it's a good spot for drinks and chips when you're downtown, but I like getting my tacos elsewhere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Barrio, their menu is different and I liked how you get to fill out exactly what you want. It is small and loud inside but the food was interesting and tasty. The tacos may seem small in size but they pack them full of food. We tried chicken and beef and enjoyed both. Their guac, salsa and queso were all awesome and the queso with rice was my favorite thing that day. Definitely try the queso with rice and chips, you'll be surprised how well it all works together."}
{"text":"Always a 10/10 experience. The atmosphere is wonderful & the tacos are very, very tasty. Get a skinny skeleton!"}
{"text":"Quality food, the freedom to build my own taco, and inexpensive prices makes Barrio a go to place for me.  I built a taco that packed a little bit of heat and mixed in a little sweet coolness to cool it down and I loved it.  I felt like a chef creating my own taco!  What is also cool about Barrio's on Prospect is that it is so close to Progressive Field. My sister and I arrived early on the day the game and felt really good about filling our bellies with Barrio tacos for less than what we would pay for inside the ballpark with tip included."}
{"text":"Good stuff    Veg friendly.     Friendly staff.    Good drinks   Love this place!   All locations are great!  Thx for coming to Willoughby!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever. Ghost pepper hot sauce is awesome. Service is great. Vegan and vegetation options.  Love this place. Cheap good food."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was awful.   Come for the drinks but stop by Taco Bell to eat before you get here."}
{"text":"Always pleased with the food. Staff .... had some good experiences with them. Margaritas are on point."}
{"text":"The food is always so good and so fairly priced that it makes up for the wait and the service at times."}
{"text":"Barrio is probably one of our favorite places in all of Cleveland. First of all I love Day of the Dead decor and they go all out. Black and white murals in the main dining hall of skeletons and in the bar large paintings of skulls and some skeletons on bikes suspended from the ceiling. We usually go during the week (the weekends are madness) and have no problems getting a seat at the bar with quick service. We usually get our free chips and salsa and drinks within 5 minutes and our orders out in less than an additional 5 minutes after ordering. Plus they serve food until 2am! The food is fun (even have make your own)  and damn delicious. The margaritas are fabulously freaking yummy! Seems like they're all made from juice and fresh ingredients. The blood orange margarita has failed no one I've ever had try it. Tart & tangy! Plus they have happy hour specials on tacos and margaritas 3pm-7pm and 9pm-2am M-F at the bar!"}
{"text":"The people who work here are actually pretty great... y'all deserve a raise. Honestly though, this place is so white, I'm surprised they don't put mayo on their shitty replica of a taco. And what's with the fake graffiti in the bathroom? Really has that white appropriation smell all over it. I waited in line for their tacos for damn near an hour and paid $7 for one beer for this? Nope. Not today satan. Never again."}
{"text":"Nice place downtown..good atmosphere..we can also customize taco and it's interesting..price is also very good..will bring my friend next time"}
{"text":"We visited the downtown Barrio location, and I was very impressed. After being used to waiting 60 minutes + in Tremont, I was thrilled to be seated immediately at this location. The food was great, as usual. I actually think it's better than the Tremont location, which has a tendency to make sloppy tacos and mess up your ingredient choices. Margaritas are some of the best in Cleveland. I definitely recommend the blood orange margaritas, queso, and either the pulled pork or steak tacos. This location had a HUGE bar and the space to accommodate tons of guests. Service was friendly and attentive, which is often not the case in Tremont, as well."}
{"text":"Since when did all the people on Yelp become crabby old folks.  It's a bar in Lakewood that serves tacos. Regardless of your experience in quaint old Tremont it delivers what one might expect. Rockin tacos, great guac, solid tequila section and unique decor.  If you want quiet you can  always try the early bird special somewhere."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a wait if you go at peak times but we like to pop in between 2-4 on a weekend when you can skip the wait (even then it's far from empty though!)   The food is more than worth it, the prices are fantastic, particularly considering the amazing quality!   I NEVER eat tofu and am not a vegan, vegetarian or health nut and I LOVE the curd ferguson! It's my all time favorite and I highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We dropped by because of the excellent Yelp reviews, and they were right.  So many fresh ingredients to build your own taco and the prices were more than fair for what you get.  The place was slammed with long waits to get in, slow service, and tables packed on top of each other.  But with food that good, it's very hard to be upset."}
{"text":"Barrio is a life changing experience. When I tell you I am addicted I mean it. Tacos are amazing and so are their margaritas. I go at least once a week. If you are not a patient person you better get here early. You are going to be  waiting for at least 15-30 minutes. But in my opinion it is so worth it. Only downfall for me is the fact that their patio is not big at all but the restaurant has a day of the dead type theme which I love."}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I decided to try Barrio in Lakewood for our weekly date night. Neither of us had ever been to the one in Tremont either, so we went in not quite knowing what to expect (except that we had heard it was a taco place).   Being the planner that I am, earlier in the day I had looked at Barrio's menu online to see what I might be having for dinner later that evening. The menu was interesting. Tacos only. That's fine-- we love tacos! I was just surprised there weren't any taco salads or any other options. But hey, if you don't like tacos, I guess this just isn't the place for you.  Anyway, looking at the menu I kind of expected our date night to be fairly inexpensive. Tacos are generally $3 each, with $1 extra here and there for guacamole, sour cream, or rice.   When we arrived, we found the restaurant was quite small-- cozy and quaint, as realtors like to say. We got sat immediately (this was at 6:30 p.m. on a Wednesday).  They serve customers water and free chips and salsa (which is always a nice perk). Although I didn't really like the salsa. It had a strange consistency and sort of tasted like a spicy ketchup. Our server was awesome. His name was Jay. Very attentive, yet chill, and had plenty to say about the food at Barrio. He told his his favorite \"appetizer\" was the chorizo queso ($8). So we decided to try that. It was very good, so I would also recommend that dip! (Although I don't really think it's worth $8)   Boyfriend and I both got margaritas, which were $7 and $8 each.   To order the tacos, there's little worksheets you fill out at your table where you can choose the tortilla type, the meat, the salsa, the cheese, etc.  They also have some tacos they recommend that are already pre-decided with all of the toppings. I chose one from the premade list and one of my own creation.  Boyfriend ordered four tacos. They were pretty tasty. Small, normal-sized tacos wrapped with tin-foil to stay together. I say that they're small, but they are really filling.   One of the things I thought was really cool about this place was that the servers have hand-held devices to type in their orders. Our server was still standing at our table right after we ordered our appetizer, and our appetizer came out of the kitchen.   The decor is very fun. Lots of skeletons and Day-of-the-Dead type stuff paintings all over the walls. Skeletons sitting on bicycles hung from the ceiling near the bar area.  The only major con to this place is the parking. It's Lakewood, so of course it's mainly street parking, and with a good restaurant like this, parking gets crowded. We ended up finding a street spot about two blocks down, so it wasn't too bad.  Back to my original thought about this place being inexpensive, for our date night it didn't quite turn out that way. Our bill was $50. Seems crazy when you're expecting to eat $3 tacos! In total, here's what was on our bill.  6 tacos 1 chorizo queso dip 2 margaritas 1 beer 1 guacamole  1 rice   $60 (once you include the tip) for dinner for two is a little expensive for my liking (and for my wallet) but I'm glad we tried it.   I wouldn't say Barrio is on my top-5 favorite restaurants, but it's definitely something worth checking out. It has a fun atmosphere and the food is good (if you like tacos)."}
{"text":"I gave them a 5 star previously for how good there tacos taste however the last time I went I asked for no pork on my tacos and they had pork on it 3 times in a row! Make sure if you ask for the no pork that there's actually no pork on it. Double check your orders"}
{"text":"It was ok. Margaritas are terrible. Server was great and tacos were good. But $4 a taco is not a good price."}
{"text":"Outrageous wait, mediocre food that upset everyone's stomach in my group. Also $4 for one taco is absurd. Hard pass on this spot."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 4 stars, but the consistent mediocre service makes me have to deduct a star. I have gone here multiple times and the service ranges from average to sucky.  I love the food, the ingredients & the atmosphere. The drinks are pricey, but the food is reasonable, so it evens out. If you want a cheap night, stick to water or pop. The music selection is usually pretty top notch as well, which always makes dinner nicer!  Come for the food, but don't expect the service to match. Enjoy the décor and the music and expect to be underwhelmed by the server"}
{"text":"Barrio, i love to food and the atmosphere , but you need to decide are you a bar or a restaurant? If you are a bar, i understand that food is secondary. If you are a restaurant, you need to work on the service, because the multiple times i have been there it is truly hit or miss. Sometimes the servers are not to be found, or act as if they are doing you a favor. Sometimes you need to beg for silverware.Other times, they forget to add your gauc to your bill and tell you nevermind(that i liked).It seems like they are running between the bar and the floor and have no clue. Other times i have ordered guac, and goten it after the meal. Timing and continuity are very helpful when eating out, at least in my opinion I love the tacos, although on occasion they have been soggy. I still keep coming back, so you must be doing something right, but one day i may just give up. As others have said, it is the happy dog of tacos. However, it also seems to be following the service at happy dog, which is not the best idea."}
{"text":"First time , great atmosphere, hostess was very friendly, waitress was exceptional.  Everything we ordered was amazing   no complaints. From the chips and guacamole to the custom ordered tacos everything was spot on."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a fun and inexpensive night out. If you don't like your food it's your own fault because it's a build-your-own taco place. But not just a taco, a gourmet taco! They have delish toppings to choose from and each taco is only $3. Some of the add-ons are extra but not much, and the tacos are really filling! They were so nice about my sisters baby being in there even that's not really a kids place.   The drink menu is really good as well. They have regular margaritas, unique margaritas and seasonal cocktails.   Whenever company comes in from out of town we always hit this place up and everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"I like this place because the food and environment is worth the dollar. You can fill up on fresh tasting tacos and drink a lot and not leave broke. The only complaint I had is when it is warm out there seemed to be a lot of gnats/flies by the bar area.."}
{"text":"Hard to go wrong with any of the Barrio locations.  Barrio Lakewood on Madison is almost always crowded and always comes through with the goods.  When you enter the bar runs the whole length of the right side of the restaurant with plenty of tables.  The decor is divey Mexican bar, but the tables are clean with the menu sheets and plenty of paper towels.  You start with a basket of fresh and tasty chips and a zippy salsa.  These will get your taste buds going.  There are plenty of drink options, with one of the best selections of tequilas in town.    The menu is simple but with plenty of options as you decide what kind of tacos you want and set the whole thing out on the order sheet.  I favor the fish of the day and the mushroom tacos.  Add some pepper and onions, some cheese and your choice of salsas and you have great meal.  I tried the Thai marinated tofu today and it was excellent with a nice firm texture and a sweet and spicy taste.    With tacos at $3 each ($2 each during Happy Hour) Barrio is one of the best deals in town, providing high quality very flavorful food at an economical price.  Hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Once again Barrio delivers a great experience.  Finally managed to find a time when I could get to the new Barrio and actually get inside.  Since Barrio opened at the top of Cedar Hill it has been incredibly busy with big crowds; there were times I couldn't even find a parking spot.  On a Monday at about 4:30pm made it in for Happy Hour and while not full, they already had a pretty big crowd.    The decor is similar to the other locations with the Day of The Dead motif mostly in black, grey and white; here it seems a little less organic and more like part of a chain.  The Lakewood location feels more like a dive bar and Tremont feels like a cool hangout, here we have a really nice and interesting execution of a theme.  Look up at the skeletons on the bikes and the cool stained glass and other lighting pieces.  The layout is a high ceiling room with a central bar and a bunch of dining areas at different levels and in different nooks.  A large staff is hustling hard to make sure that everyone is taken care of.  Barrio Cleveland Heights brings the same great food and drinks to the East Side, the tacos are great, although I noticed that while the protein in the tacos seemed to be the same, it seemed as if they were putting a little less other items in, the result is a slightly less messy taco, yet the flavors are still great.   Chips and an excellent salsa are great and just add to the value.  It will be interesting to see how the crowds hold up, right now it would be best to try to find the off times to try and get in. When the good weather comes and they will open up the front windows and the back patio and it will be huge crowds once again.   Truly a great addition to the East Side and if it continues the way it is going, they will have to look for another East Side location."}
{"text":"Barrio is outstanding.  If you have visited you know how good their tacos are, serious culinary skill served at a reasonable price.  Each location is a bit different in decor, but they all have the Day of the Dead theme going.     Once in you select exactly what you want using the order pads.  I always favor the fish of the day, the mushroom and even the marinated tofu are really good.  I also really enjoy the fresh crisp chips and the zesty salsa with a perfect level of heat.  What I have to talk about here is the Sunday Brunch; in addition to the regular menu they add some special items that are outstanding.  The Crab Cake taco takes a well seasoned patty of sweet crab meat with enough bread crumbs to hold it together.  Layered with avocado, a zesty slaw and a well balanced remoulade you have one of the better crab cakes in town.  What I would not miss is the Barrio French Toast Bowl, a hearty serving of the lushest bread pudding you will find topped with whipped cream.  Just sweet enough to hit the taste buds, with hints of cinnamon and vanilla, this is extremely satisfying.   When you hit some of the crunchy caramelized bits on top you will be in heaven.  If you like Mexican, Tacos or are just seeking some great food at a reasonable price you have to go to Barrio."}
{"text":"Al a carte. Service isn't always great, but the food is phenomenal, ALWAYS !! Best salsa around. Love the margaritas. Great menu options for anyone's taste buds"}
{"text":"It was pretty good, My 10 year old little girl really liked it and i was afraid she would not but she was pretty happy."}
{"text":"Disappointed in this location, first time visit. I stopped in on a whim last night at 6:15 seeing people outside eating chips and guac. Asked the bartender how long it would take to get an order to go, then which type of guac he'd recommend. He said it would take less than 5 minutes and recommended the special tuscan guac which has avocado, pine nuts, balsamic glaze and sundried tomatoes. My first thought was that it would be a weird flavor combination and too sweet for our taste, but took him up on his recommendation. I asked how much it would be for a half order of salsa to go with it. He charged me $9.50. 25 minutes later I was still waiting at the bar for my take-out order, and after I asked the other girl at the bar how long it would be (twice), she gave me a glazed look and said \"I'm packing your order now\". It came out chips/guac only. After 5 more minutes validating the cost for my order with the guy I ordered it from (he was patronizing me trying to state I'd ordered a full order of guac and corn salsa, which did not amount to $9.50 but  $13.00), I showed him the $9.50 ticket charge, then he said \"Cool!\" Got home and I was right on the guac, it was so sweet we could not eat it. It was not super busy and there was no sense of customer service here. Very disappointed in this experience and would not recommend. The guac wasn't the issue it was the service. Tremont location is better."}
{"text":"Lord have mercy, I love Barrio. The food is wonderful and the margarita selection is perfection. Willoughby location wait may be long but worth it."}
{"text":"So..this is one of those places that the \"hipster\" likes to wait more than a hour for a table (actually is was about a hour and 15min, no lie) then sit down and get served.. well imitation Mexican food? It was horrible don't get me wrong, but Mezcal up the street kills it. I'm not sure what the attraction is to this and places like Chipotle, but it's not for me."}
{"text":"Holy yummo tacos! Today was my first time at Barrio in my lifetime. I know what your thinking, I've been living under a rock. My bother and sister in law rave about Barrio. This was the first place I suggested we go to together! Great choice on my part and great recommendation from them! This new location opened up here back in January of this year so it's very new and very popular. I got here 450 pm and I'm glad I got there when I did. I got a table in the bar area and waited for my plus 2s to get there. It was happy hour! Bonus! Drink specials and 1$ off tacos from 4-7! Prime time! I don't drink so I cant tell you about the drinks but I can tell you about the food! The waitress was so nice enough to explain the ordering process and the options available. There is a score card type sheet at the table and you fill out how you want your tacos prepared with all the fixings you want. So many to choose from! You are also given free chips and salsa when you sit down. Refills kept coming! I'm not vegetarian or vegan but the Thai chili tofu and portobello mushrooms sounded fantastic! I got a soft taco with Thai chili tofu with pineapple salsa apple jicama and sautéed peppers and onions. I also got a soft taco with portobello mushrooms with lettuce sautéed peppers and onions and cilantro pesto sauce. Love that sauce! Both were fantastic! The tofu was spicier than I hoped but the sweetness of the apple jicama and pineapple salsa leveled it out. 3 bucks a taco which was 2$ a taco during happy hour. There are specialty tacos for 4$ and up-charges for certain ingredients. We also ordered the corn salsa queso and the traditional guacamole! Both were so good but the queso is top notch. Get it! You won't regret it! The price is unbeatable during happy hour and regular pricing is not bad. 3$ or 4$ for a custom made taco with fresh ingredients made the way you want to?! Can't beat it. Of course the drinks will set you back some cash but better choice to come during happy hour. The 3 of us was only 35$ not including tip. Great deal This is a great place to hang out with friends and family but it gets busy..like really really busy! Don't come here if you are in a hurry. The wait is worth it though so don't leave if you aren't in a rush. Parking can be a biotch. Road parking and 2 lots but certain days valet starts ridiculously early for the brewing company  and Sol in the back so parking spots are reserved. Bullshit. People aren't going there. They want Barrio yo! Come here Nowwweeee!"}
{"text":"Best tacos and queso in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Gosh i've been to barrio no joke about 50+ times and i've only had about 5 bad experiences (so I will gladly take those odds) and the last time the food was just ehhhh.   Has it lost it's delicious luster I don't know we'll see next time?"}
{"text":"Been to barrio like a million times I usually go at least (min) once a week! Can't say enough good things however there is one bartender who looks like a knock off Seth Rogan (he works behind the bar at Lakewood location)... He's super unfriendly and simply kind of rude! Not sure why your in the customer service business if you act like you hate people and life itself!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for dinner with two friends and was very happy with the meal.  I like the build your own taco concept, so if you end up hating it, well, it's your fault!  I got 3, and for $3 each, you walk out with a full belly and a still full wallet.  Do yourself a favor and pay the extra buck to get the stoner taco, it's amazing!!    One taco had pulled pork that had just the right amount of heat to it, another with grilled chicken and the jicama strawberry slaw on that was fantastic, and the third (stoner taco) I got with chorizo, and that taco already comes with it so the double dose was the best.  We also got the guacamole special of the day, I believe it was mango with candied bacon.  Generous portion for about $6.  Drinks were not crazy expensive, and I got the skinny skeleton margarita (about as basic a margarita you can get) and the R1 Caramelo.  It was $6 of nearly nothing but alcohol, so good deal.  The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the tacos weren't as hot as I would have liked, and the Caramelo didn't really taste anything like caramel as our server had suggested.  However, we did walk out of there stuffed to the point of being uncomfortable, so that's a win in my book!  Would definitely go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Friendly staff and amazing Tacos! Their happy hour is a great thing to take advantage of. This is our usual stop before a show downtown. They are very accommodating to large groups and have a wonderful patio when it is nice outside. Their menu is a build your own style with plenty of options to choose from. You may also want to take advantage of their pre-picked taco options if you are feeling less creative. They have a fully stocked bar with many tequila options and margarita specials. Tacos and margaritas by the pitcher... What more can you ask for!!!"}
{"text":"Wandered into Barrio on my first trip to Cleveland and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, customizable tacos, queso, and sangria. A must try if you're in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to eat in Cleveland! Tacos are incredible. The only negative is it's usually pretty busy and it's a small place. However, it's worth the wait and makes for a great environment."}
{"text":"This place is buzzing for good reasons. The tacos were unique and delicious. The decor is super trendy and this location is closer to east side suburbs than the others. However I probably won't be back for several reasons or I'll at least wait until the hype dies down.  My first problem with Barrio is the fact that it was packed when I went on a Saturday around 6pm. We had to wait for 45 minutes for a table and then were there for close to 3 hours between ordering, eating and then waiting for our server to get back to us. Seriously they need to hire more staff! The other thing to note about the employees is that the host and hostess were so unfriendly. They might have been overwhelmed by the amount of ppl but it was such an unwelcoming vibe to walk into.  The food was not the best taco experience I've had in my life but it was solid. We got free chips and salsa from the beginning which is always nice, I hate places that make you pay for it and we got several refills of our chips for free too. We ended up ordering the jalepeno queso which was basically a plain queso with some fried jalepenos on top and it was just okay.   The actual tacos were very flavorful and filling and we liked the fact that you could build your own or choose from the chef created versions. It is nice that you order by filling out an order form and then handing it over to your waiter but then it also makes me think like what is the point of having a waiter in the first place.   In terms of pricing, this place is way overpriced. Each taco is between 3-4$ and certain extras bring that price up even higher. Everything is a la cart which I personally am not a fan of. Like I said though, the food was decent but for all of the negatives I can't see myself becoming a regular. In the end the total for 3 people without drinks was $65 and for me that is too much for a taco."}
{"text":"Tacos are good but usually cold.  And that's not what's keeping me from going there again. The service is less than mediocre and I shit you not our server accused me of stealing a taco. And I am no thief. Especially of tacos.   Me and boyfriend went there and both ordered three tacos, we were hungry! So when we got our order he got his 3 tacos and I received 2. I thought hey no big deal When the server comes back around I'll let her know. She ghosted us through our whole meal. Only came back around when she gave us our check which to my surprise had a total of 6 tacos.  When I brought up the whole \"didn't get my other taco\" thing she said and I quote \"well how are we supposed to know\" like pretty much saying how are we supposed to know you didn't eat the third taco? I was appalled, I couldn't help but laugh. She did fix the mistake but not before she told me that \"next time\" to let them know. Which would be great if their servers actually did their job.   Barrio your food is pretty good but your servers and hostesses are a nightmare."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant in my Cleveland visit! As others have noted, you build your own tacos for $3 per. I had 2 for lunch, perfect portion for lunch.  There is an option to mix a hard and soft shell for $1 extra and I highly recommend you choose this option. Whoever thought to pair the hard & soft shell together for that extra crunch is GENIUS. (Another genius thought was to wrap and serve the tacos in foil - what a simple life hack but still so smart!)  We also had fun choosing the salsas and sauces (you can get more than 1!) and ended up with tacos packed with flavor... Next time though I might refrain from too many sauces, as I couldn't discern the flavors all that much having mixed the sauces. I opted for fish of the day for both tacos, and the catfish was meaty and salty, almost like tuna.   Chips and salsa on the house."}
{"text":"Yummy non-traditional tacos, great drinks, and best of all, OPEN LATE!"}
{"text":"I'm going to be real blunt on this. I've had a few tacos from their truck and it's been \"decent\". When I went to their restaurant which recently opened in my neighborhood I was very disappointed.   First of all it was a Monday night and the music was SO LOUD my waitress had to shout the info on how to order and believe me I love to blast my music too just not to the point where people at the table have to yell for their conversation. And I'm not old   In terms of the appetizers the \"queso\" was lukewarm and just unappetizing . It looked like liquid watery white cheese wiz (and that is giving it too much credit) . It was really disgusting. We sent it back.  The taco with the tofu had a Sweet pineapple sauce with cabbage that it literally tasted like I was eating sweet and sour sauce from a Chinese restaurant and it was WAY TOO SWEET. Not anything like eating Mexican food.   Last the tacos we got came with dirty sauce. I could see if they just added a little to enhance the taco but it was soaked into the taco and it was so hot that we couldn't eat more than one bite.   What else....when u order sides of beans and rice the serve them to u in small to-go condiment containers with plastic fork/spoon. Unclassy....and no thought. Maybe that crap works on a truck when u serve people but not at a sit down restaurant.   You guys really need to rethink all this stuff. I'm not an expert but I've traveled all over the world and I have a great palate, not to mention I'm Mexican and I split my time between Cleveland heights and my hometown of LA.   I live in the Fairmount area but I don't think I'll be coming back unless you guys make serious changes. Too bad it's a decent idea.   By the way....less is more. Make food with just the basics and it would taste better. Adding all the extra stuff makes it just plain nasty."}
{"text":"I have now been here (to the Lakewood location) twice.  The first time, the service was remarkably bad. The waitress doesn't even need to take an order or deliver food, yet she managed to not bring us water and not bring us a drink.  The deliciousness of the food lured me back....last night we had excellent service.  Maybe we just got the one good server, but she was attentive and nice and brought everything we asked for.   Yum......already craving it again!"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes for a beer menu then never got served even a beer as people were getting served all around us!  When we asked to speak to a manager, a very young waiter \"helped\" us, not not really. Total waste of time!!!  Will NOT be back to this location ever again!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. They claim to have all types of whiskey and Bourbon yet when you order one they pour you one shot over a few half melted ice cubes. The server immediately started whining about how long she had been there that day and how she didn't want to review the specials for us. When it was time for the check she disappeared and then came back without the check after asked for it. The larger restaurant takes away from the charm of the original in Lakewood. Feels more like a chain now. Food is still excellent but service and lack of bar tending skills are something to keep me away from this sellout spot."}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing Barrio and I liked it.  It is an open-air eatery with a young and helpful staff.  It was busy but we were seated faster than expected.  And the staff was also accommodating when we requested different seating.  Our waitress was timely and personable.  There are two kinds of menus.  One menu had pre-packaged options and the other is kind of DIY.  I chose the latter.  Knowing what you like and how to put your taco together makes a difference in your experience.   The Coca Cola steak was the BOMB!  I look forward to eating there again."}
{"text":"So what's so popular about a place that sells tacos and tequila?  It doesn't sound like a recipe for huge success, but this local chain does a great job and this newest location does well.  Indoor and outdoor seating are available weather permitting.  There are several chef suggested tacos or you can design your own.  Don't miss the queso, as it is outstanding.  There are occasional features, including nachos, which should not be missed.  The Sunday brunch, featuring smoked salmon tacos is worth a trip.  And yes, there are the margaritas.  All are well made and flavorful.  Service is attentive.  Overall, a fun place with good food.  Parking has been a challenge, but I recently saw a valet parking sign on a Saturday evening...."}
{"text":"loved it...worth the drive and (possible) wait.  service was attentive...and the tacos to die for.  i had chicken, green goddess, jicama slaw, corn salsa, chipotle honey aloli.  my daughter had green goddess shell with chicken, tomatoes, cilantro, onions corn salsa, cilantro lim aoili.....and my margarita was perfect.  i will be back."}
{"text":"Well Lauren F, what a winner you must be. I work in the service industry and received my college degree in hospitality management. I was also at barrio that night and would beg to differ. The staff was attentive and I thought the hostess did a fine job. I think Lauren might have been confused on who the brain dead one was. First of all what restaurant have you been to that the hostess takes a food order? Secondly, when you have an issue how about asking to speak to manage/ownership (which I did) to find out what was going on with the patio. The logical explanation I received was it was a MANAGEMENT choice to close the second half of the patio so the kitchen would not get too backed up. It absolutely disgust me that we in the industry are suppose to help people that hide behind a computer and bash us but don't have the guts to say it.You really went out of your way to bash a beautiful, and from my interaction with her,intelligent young woman, maybe your husband was too busy gawking at her and that's why you were so mad. Either way I was more than satisfied with my visit to Barrio and Lauren maybe taco bell would be more suiting to you."}
{"text":"I am from Atlanta and I been drinking alcohol 20 years nows this is the worst bar I ever visit. All drinks I have order I couldn't test any alcohol. When I complained to the manager he was like that's how we make it. If you really do make this kind of drinks then you need to learn again. Horrible drinks   I do like the food though. Best pork tacos."}
{"text":"We were in town this weekend for the Cavs game and decided to give Barrio a try.  I like tacos, and chips and salsa, as much as I like any food on earth, so I was very excited about this visit.    Due to this being a game night we arrived about 4:15 on Saturday and did so due to what we believed would be quite a crowd after 5:00 p.m.  This proved to be a good approach since Barrio was already packed at this early hour, but nevertheless we were able to get a table for two without wait.  The interior is very eclectic - think Melt Bar and Grilled.  The two dining areas are very large and there is a bar in the east room.  Volume was very loud and it is stressful.  We are greeted quickly by our waitress, Victoria, and I ask what the process is to order.  On our table was a drink menu and specialty taco menu, but no regular menu.  We were instructed to complete the order sheet ourselves as this is the actual menu.  I can see the advantage to this approach since it removes the possibility for miscommunication between the customer and wait staff.  My wife orders a strawberry margarita and two crunchy tacos with chicken, lettuce, and queso on the side.  I try chicken soft tacos with cilantro-lime rice and western reserve smoked cheddar cheese.  Shortly after ordering, chips and salsa arrive at our table.  We found these to be the best version we have ever tried.  Chips were perfect and the salsa was superb.  The salsa was, in fact, so good that I'm not sure if I will ever look at salsa the same way again.  Unfortunately, the chips and salsa were the beginning and end of the positives.  Our food arrives in 15-20 minutes and we were not overly impressed.  The flavors in my simple soft tacos were out of whack.  I could not taste the rice at all, the cheddar cheese overwhelmed the other ingredients, and the seasoning on the chicken was not great.  My wife's crunchy tacos were fried a minute, or two, too long which made the predominant flavor a burnt taste.  Her strawberry margarita was okay until she got to the bottom 1/4 of the drink; it became nearly pure strawberry syrup at this point which was not pleasant.      Our waitress was maybe 18 or 19 years old and was not personable, friendly, or attentive.  When we were done eating she promised to be back with our check... which she did, however, it took about fifteen minutes to receive it and I had to remind her that we were still waiting for it.  To play devil's advocate, they were very busy and I can see how that may have been overwhelming.  Final bill was $28 - tip not included.  Due to my undying love affair with tacos we will be back, but will probably try the Lakewood location.  I would probably try a different cheese (three are offered) and a different type of meat.  Three stars for GREAT chips and salsa, an interesting interior decor, great location, and fresh high quality ingredients.  Only three stars due to so-so flavors and sub-par service.  Wanted to love this place.  It definitely has the potential to be something special."}
{"text":"Looking for overpriced underwhelming tacos?  Then this is your spot!  This place has a lot of the hipster lifestyle down.  It's more expensive than you think.  When it's all put together it's kind of a mess.  Most of us would rather look than experience.  The drinks are weak and the food is bland.  Most of their hot sauces would barely make the Scoville scale and do even less to add flavor.  The great news is the layout and patio.  This place has some real potential, but not until they redo their recipes and rethink their drink prices."}
{"text":"I had the best taco I've ever had yesterday at warped tour. And it was vegan. Love it. It may have been the best thing I've ever eaten in my life."}
{"text":"Hands down this is one of the best places to eat and have drinks downtown! The staff is always kind and at the top of their game no matter how busy things get with games and whatnot. Anytime I visit the Land this is a must stop! The jalepeno margarita and shrimp tacos are some of my favorites! A special thank you to last evenings staff after game 6! I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check out Barrio on a Saturday night about 8pm.  We got seated right away in the dining area and the restaurant was hopping.  There were a lot of staff walking around however our server was pretty casual,  this wasn't a bad thing!  We didn't have to wait to be served and if we wanted to having a quick dinner I'm sure we could have.  It was nice to take our time and just relax, maybe this was because it was later in the evening, but we never felt rushed to turn over our table to another customer.  I got a margarita and it was ok; good, but not great.  You can add flavors to the margarita so I'll have to try that next time.  My boyfriend got the margarita with Jack Daniels and then a beer.  He enjoyed both of those.  They have a pretty extensive drink menu with beer, tequila and whiskey.  We were served salsa and chips while we decided on our food order.  They were both yummy.  For tacos we both ordered 3 with a side of rice.  They are build your own tacos with a few things if you double up like meat are extra.  Just 2 tacos would have been enough.  I don't remember what all I put on them, but they were both good.  The one was spicier than expected.  So, I wish there was a heat scale on the menu or something similar.  I loved their decor!  It was very pleasant to look at and different than your normal mexican decor.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've been all over the country and I've never had better tacos. Barrio is the place to go for tacos, queso, guac, and margs.  It is relatively inexpensive and fantastic.  There are four locations currently around the Cleveland area, I have been to 3/4 and had great experiences. The tacos are build your own tacos and are only $3.00 each.  There are specialty tacos as well that are $4.00 each.   The queso blanco is my favorite appetizer to start off with.  The traditional guacamole is also good.  Their chips are always warm.  There are also specials of different kinds of tacos, guac, and queso that changes on a monthly basis.   Their margaritas start at $6.00 a glass (an extra $1.00 to add a flavor) and are delicious favorite flavors are mango and blood orange.  Their are also seasonal margarita flavors as well.  If margaritas aren't your choice of drink there is a full service bar that can make you whatever you'd like.  Caution here, they do not accept reservations and this place is always busy. If you are going just for the restaurant make sure it is not before or after an Indians or Cavs game or you could be waiting upwards of an hour as the restaurant is not that big."}
{"text":"The drinks are pretty terrible - get a beer instead. The food is great. The last time I was there, though, the hostess sat us on the patio and we sat there for 25 minutes before getting up and leaving because no one ever came to our table. No hello, no water, nothing - despite seeing two or three employees tending to surrounding tables during that time. Uh, k, bye."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go with friends. You can make each taco suitable to your own tastes. For an extra dollar, I got a taco bowl. The bowl, it seems, comes with more food and is more filling than if you would order it with a tortilla. They give out unlimited salsa and chips that taste fresh and crispy. However, I would highly recommend their guacamole."}
{"text":"Wow Sat there for 10 minutes and had multiple servers and hostess walk by and was not even greeted"}
{"text":"I love this location the patio is awesome the service is always good Angela the bartender was cool AF.  She was super friendly and knowledgeable after a bad experience at the Cleveland Hts location Angela made me really want to keep coming back to Barrio."}
{"text":"Recently moved to the Lakewood/Cleveland area from Columbus. A co-worker referred me to Barrio. Everything Ive ever had here is so tasty. I am a sucker for blood orange and their blood orange margaritas are top notch. The variety of tacos are unreal. Chips, salsa, guac oh my...all so good. Finally, recently had friends from Columbus up here visiting, decided to do a late lunch here on a saturday afternoon. All 3 ladies said they wished there was a taco place like this in Columbus!"}
{"text":"I personally prefer this location over Tremont and Lakewood. More available tables and bar seating. Same great service and food as the other locations. And even being downtown the parking isnt that bad. Ive always been able to find a spot on the street. Well worth the drive from Lakewood"}
{"text":"Yummy! Made-to-order tacos with a create-your-own menu.   The Green Goddess is what I find most intriguing - a hard taco shell wrapped in a layer of guac and then wrapped in soft shell. Fan-tastic!"}
{"text":"The food was not all that good, wine was wattered down, margaritas were also bad, we were charged for taco sides that were listed as included with taco price, soggy soft taco shells, taco meat was very bland. Food served cold, some orders were incorrect, slow to bring food and check on a night that was not busy at all. Will not go back. Only good points were that the food was edible and it was clean."}
{"text":"Not your typical taqueria or street taco joint, however satisfying none the less.   The tacos we ordered all tasted great, however the ordering process is so bizarre and confusing. Even with the waitress explaining how to order I still messed up the sheet you feel out.  You essentially build your own tacos...  I was also disappointed to not see lengua as an option for meat and no churros for dessert.  Not the best tacos I've had, but good enough"}
{"text":"Loved their tacos!  Happy hour is awesome. 2$ tacos and half off margaritas.  The stoner is amazing, soft taco queso then hard taco.  The chorizo is fantastic, its my favorite protein selection.  The ingredients overall are very fresh.  The fish taco was also great.  The complimentary chips and salsa are flavorful.  3 tacos are more than enough for dinner and would probably just recommend 2 for a light eater."}
{"text":"One of the best place to get tacos in Cleveland! Trendy, many delicious specialty tacos, which I would recommend if you're a first timer to barrio. With so many options for a build your own taco- it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Definitely recommend the green goddess shell! Make sure you try their brunch!! The crab cake taco is my absolute favorite but only served at brunch! Happy hour is also an amazing deal"}
{"text":"I cannot believe it took me 3.5 years to make it to Barrio. What the heck was I thinking? Happy hour was unbelievably great. Half off margaritas and $1 off tacos. I think I spend the same amount of money at Taco Bell, which blows my mind. Cary S. gave me the genius idea to get a half mango/half jalapeño margarita (on the rocks) and it was soooooo good. It was a perfect mix of spicy and sweet, but not too sweet like most margs can be. We ordered the queso with chorizo, which was absolutely divine. The three of us destroyed it in minutes. The salsa that came with the chips was particularly delicious. I can't say I get that impressed with house salsa as much as I did with this one.   I created two tacos, which made me a little nervous cause I'm not the best at create-your-own foods due to my over zealous nature of wanting to put everyyyything on my taco/hot dog/burrito. I kept things simple, and my tacos were on point. Don't miss the green goddess (lives up to the hype), or the jicama slaw and red cabbage if you like crispy veggies. The Barrio secret taco sauce definitely had a great kick to it. The chorizo and braised beef were perfection.   Seriously, if you like tacos and happy hour, you can't miss Barrio. I had no complaints with my meal. Service was spot on the we barely had to wait for our food. You will find me here every week from here on out.  Pro Tip: Come here for weeknight HH. I once tried to grab dinner on a Saturday and the wait was over 3 hours. Welp."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tacos and margaritas!!! Great happy hour!  They have the chef's selections or build your own. I've never had anything I didn't like!"}
{"text":"Scolded by young hostess that we sat ourselves after coming in back door.  No sign  to see hostess existed nor did she bother to great us until spoken to as she cleaned tables inches from where we sat in a completely empty dining room until she seated another party.  She was a young person with some control issues and lack of customer service skills. Once a server was assigned, service was pleasant if succinct.  Decent beer selection. Went with a couple of the suggested tacos which were decent tasting but cold.  Not room temp, but as if prepped hours before and then pulled out of a fridge and placed on a plate bypassing even a microwave.  No one likes cold chicken tacos.  The habanero sauce is legit.   Back door locked upon trying to exit.  Unlocked to depart.  Hope they were OK."}
{"text":"Barrio has the best tacos and margaritas that I've ever had. I had gone to the locations downtown and in Treemont multiple times, and was excited to try the new one in Cleveland Heights. Similar to the Treemont location, the Cleveland Heights barrio has delicious food and drinks with a great casual atmosphere.   Barrio is known for their incredible happy hour during which margaritas and tacos are $3 and $1, respectively. If you are near Cleveland Heights, make sure to check out this location."}
{"text":"Great concept restaurant. Tacos. Nothing more. The build your own is a pretty easy way to go and at $3 a pop they are very well priced. I've got a healthy appetite and after 2 taco bowls I was pretty stuffed.   I will echo comments about food coming out  sorta cold. Not horribly cold but just not piping hot. May be related to cold sauces and guac they use, I don't know.   Margarita was standard. Maybe a little weak. Atmosphere was excellent. A bit of a hipster joint but not over the top. I'd go back"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and overall:  Fun spin on tacos.  The specials are always interesting sounding and I've honestly only had the guts try one or two.  My only complaint:  the salsa is really good some days and not good others.  The wall murals provide for a good vibe- I mean who doesn't love day of the dead stuff?!?!  This place is with checking out."}
{"text":"Love all of the vegetarian and even vegan options. Service is always personal and outstanding !"}
{"text":"Lakewood has a lot of mexican fare. A LOT! But Barrio really sets itself out from the crowd. The tacos are amazing! It's build your own tacos, from shell (I recommend the Green Goddess shell) to meat to salsa, veggies and cheeses. They also have recommended options and the daily taco, both of which are stellar. I have never had a bad taco at Barrio.   Every weekday, from 4-7, they have $1 tacos (which a fairly priced to begin with). Also, one Wednesday they have Whiskey Wednesday (half off all their whiskeys). Aka, top shelf whiskey for the cheapest you'll find it anywhere (ex: 18 year single malt Macallan = $10 a pour). Just last week, I got 12 year single malt Tullamore Dew for $3.5. It's a deal you cannot beat. Every weekday they have half off margaritas and tequila (no tequila special on Wed though). Also during their happy hour, they have $1 off drafts. All the specials are in the bar area only, but it is a rather large bar area so it's easy to find a seat.   My friends and I love tacos and we love whiskey. And we love cheap. So we make sure to be at Barrio at least twice a month on Wed, if not weekly.   The Lakewood location just opened within the last few months and already it's one of my favorite spots in a city with a lot going on. This is a must try restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been here two times including last night 7/3. We had a pretty large group and everything came out quickly and the waiter was friendly and even have us some shot recommendations. The pulled pork is easily the best filler and the green goddess tortilla is the bomb. Also, I love the fact that there is a place to eat in the Cleveland area other than Denny's or Panini's after 9:30pm."}
{"text":"HOLY GUACAMOLE, literally.  I just wanted to update but I'm not going to lie, I fell in love with their CALABAZA PUMPKIN, BUTTERNUT SQUASH GUAC  \"spanish pumpkin, butternut squash, carrots, red peppers roasted with pickled serrano peppers & scallions; topped with pepita seed crunch\"  They always have some really cool guacs but this and maybe the watermelon have been my favorite so far.  I can't wait to see what December brings.  Get it Barrio!"}
{"text":"Barrio is one of our favorite spots in Cleveland! If you're looking for a fun atmosphere, with quick food and drinks at good prices, then this is the Mexican Bar for you!  The crowd is typically young professionals, and young people out on fun/casual dates. While I've never personally eaten on the patio or the \"sit down\" portion of the restaurant, they are offered if you want a more classic dining experience.  Otherwise, I'd recommend sitting in the bar area and grabbing a couple stools between you and your friends.   The staff is mostly nice and friendly.  We did have one host get a bit huffy when we snagged a table after some people left at a busy time. Most places the whole bar area is first come, first serve, but you do have to wait for these tables -- only the actual bar is first come first serve. If you want to avoid dealing with this come early, or even better, come late! The later crews we have been around are much more laid back and like to socialize. My fiancee and I went on a date there a few months back and had a GREAT waitress who told us about their margaritas and the creative process they had in \"designing\" their signature drink. Very cool if you're foodies like we are!  The ordering couldn't be more simple. There's quite a few straightforward choices for Margaritas and sometimes they have a daily special.  If they ever have the Thyme and Blackberry Margarita, you should go for it...delicious. My personal favorite, go for the El Diablo for a nice change from the fabulous Margarita! Yum!  The food is of course the highlight.  They're the best street tacos in Cleveland, starting at $3 a taco for the most basic offerings. Many times, I'm full after two...these aren't sisssy foods we're talking about. This is tacos Cleveland style baby. Check out the stoner and go crazy trying different combinations. All you have to do is fill out one of their simple order notepads at any table or corner of the bar and hand it to a staff member walking by.  If you ever have a problem, don't be afraid to speak up. We've had little things happen like a cold taco and a margarita without salt (OH THE HUMANITY!!) and the staff have always taken care of us. Really the only issues we've had are with the long waits...and a few of the hot sauces burning my mouth! I can handle my spice...but their rack of sauces doesn't mess around!  So, as you can tell, we are huge fans of this place. If you're looking for a fun casual 3rd+ date place and you can handle a bit of noise, take your squeeze here and enjoy the atmosphere. If you're hanging with some friends and want a chill place to watch sports or chew the fat, come later and experience a more laid back vibe.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love Barrio. A little pricey compared to other taco/Tex-mex eats, but worth it.  Friendly service, and excellent food and drink in a super fun, evening out atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I really like this place.  The other reviewers have already described how it works - you write your order on a card and hand it in.  My food has always been delicious and well worth the $3/taco (and even better if you catch happy hour and get them for $2).  I went with a friend last time and we caught the tail end of happy hour.  Between us we got 6 tacos, chips and guac, and three drinks (technically four, but more about that in a minute), all for $25.  Can't beat that.    The service can be a little spotty, but considering that it's only a month old, I'm willing to continue giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Our server last time forgot to put my second drink in, but she voluntarily comped it.  I was watching her run around a very crowded bar, and my friend and I weren't in a hurry, so it wasn't a big deal to me at all, but I appreciate that she took the initiative.  The kinks should work themselves out as they're open longer, but if you're in a hurry or a demanding customer, you might wanna avoid this place for a while.  If you just want to hang out on a nice patio drinking margaritas and eating cheap, delicious tacos, then you''d be hard pressed to find a better spot."}
{"text":"Food was great and the tacos are dirt cheap. Wait time to be seated is quite long. During happy hour it is even worse."}
{"text":"Brunch was exceptional and the server, Andrea was awesome. Always order a little less food than you think; so filling. The jojo's are a great choice to share, or as an entree. The chips are def deep fried! Egg tacos are a favorite of mine and they did not disappoint. It seems nobody really knows about the brunch yet, because it was pretttyyy empty. So go and enjoy some great breakfast tacos, quick service and quiet scene with no wait... While it's still a \"secret\"."}
{"text":"Barrio is a weekly spot for me. I go with my co-workers, husband and bring out of town guests. The atmosphere is PERFECT!! Casual yet trendy, hoppin but not too loud and the perfect prices for quick, fresh and delicious food.  And now that it's warming up, whew is it beautiful?? Barrio has these beautiful garage doors that completely slide into the ceiling to expose diners to the sunshine in the front of the restaurant. AND they have an outdoor patio :)   The tacos are spectacular, cocktails are made with fresh ingredients and the beer options are crafty and endless.  I love barrio and since its opening in Cleveland Heights my life has improved by 80% ;)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to go with friends. The amount of times I've been to barrio is literally countless. You cannot beat the price or the flavor. 3 dollar tacos with nearly anything you want on them? What could be better? I would recommend the Thai grilled tofu, and trust me it's the best protein they have by far. The only things I think they could improve is the serving times, some times it can be especially long."}
{"text":"I came with a group of 5 around 10:30 and we sat in the front bar area. We had 2 pitchers of margaritas - the flavor was good but our first pitcher was mostly ice and there wasn't enough there for all 5 of us (we got 4 small glasses out of it)! When we ordered the second pitcher I requested less ice and it was appropriately filled.  My friends did the \"Build Your Own Taco\" menu and were happy but I ordered the \"suggested\" taco combinations. I had the Moooo-chas Gracias, the Hasta la Vista, Baby, and the Remember the Alamo - all were very tasty.There is a whole rack of hot sauces on a wall so it was fun to sample all of them. Our orders came out quickly and our waiter was attentive and accommodating. The interior was trending and the whole scene was lively. There are tables in a back area with a fireplace that seemed very cozy. I would come again and recommend others."}
{"text":"Walked into Barrio and immediately felt like a void in Tremont had been filled.  No longer does one have to wait for Tuesday to get great tacos!  First the art work is amazing.  We had a chance to talk to the artist and he described how the mural is telling a story.  You start on the left side of the room and work your way around as it tells of a guy who meets a girl, they get pregnant, get married, have kids and thus the cycle starts over.  It's super creative and fun. They have a creative drink list with plenty of tequila drinks.  I didn't drink during my visit but my friends both had a couple and loved each one.  We got to try a wide variety of tacos and a bunch of the different toppings.  We also got complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa was fresh tasting and the chips were addicting, but a little greasy.  You get a pen and a checklist and decide if you want hard corn taco, soft corn taco or soft flour taco.  Then choose your meat, salsa, toppings and sauces.  I tried a soft corn taco, hard corn taco, the chorizo, braised beep and pork.  I also tried a bunch of the salsas and sauces.  I put cilantro, onion, cabbage tomato on each taco.   By far my favorite was the hard corn taco shell with braised beef.  The beef was full of flavor and tender.  It was so good.  The pork was delicious as well.  All the toppings were yummy.  The sauces were creative (sorry I honestly cannot remember any of them except some had mango habernaro and cilantro something)  Foodwise I can see myself coming back quite a bit seeing as they serve food til 2 am.  However,  the main irk I had was that it was lacking in spice.  The chorizo lacked it and even the spiciest salsa seemed mild.  We even asked our server for the spiciest salsa they had.  She came back with their house hot sauce saying the kitchen wouldn't give us the hottest because it was too hot.  Even their house hot sauce was pretty mild.  Trust me, if I'm ordering the hottest salsa and sauce you have, I can handle it.  Bring it on.  Also, we tried the queso and it was too cheesy (if that makes sense)  It was like eating a bowl of melted American cheese.  Not my favorite either.    For just opening things were pretty smooth.  The servers were all extremely nice.  It was a little odd because we had two full-time servers.  Everytime one came over, the other would come right after and ask the same question.  We had servers take our drink orders twice, food orders twice, were checked on twice as much.  Kinda odd. But oh well.   I'm really excited this place has opened and look forward to coming back often!"}
{"text":"I first discovered this amazing Taco place two years ago and I couldn't be more pleased with the food and the atmosphere of the place on Madison in Lakewood,oh.  So a friend and I decided to check out their Tremont location yesterday. We dined on the patio, ordered drinks and we started to notice that there was a couple with a small dog sitting in the lap of a lady while she was eating. As we looked around we could see several more guests with dogs.  I think its a great thing to take your dog along with you places. But, to dinner on a enclosed patio ?? Then I started to notice a group of sparrows sitting on the string of lights above  of our table and many other guest tables. Which was interesting to watch as they flew between people to get food on uncleared tables. But what caught me attention was the amount of dog hair that was on the patio floor and the bottom of our chairs !      It was nasty ...  I took a pic for you to see"}
{"text":"You're gonna hear it a million times, but I'll say it here first: this is basically the Happy Dog of tacos.   You get a little check sheet with all of their available ingredients and you can build your own taco for $3. The ingredients are all fresh and tasty and there are plenty of ways to make your taco vegetarian or vegan. They have awesome chips, guac, and queso that you can make a sampler platter out of.  I had two specialty drinks- both of which were served in Ball glass jars- a nice touch in my book. They weren't too sweet and had quality ingredients, but were a little pricier than I prefer for a drink ($8-$9.)  The waitstaff was very attentive and sweet. They're also open until 2am for all of your non-fastfoody 4th meal needs!  Great patio, beautiful bar, totally destined to become super crowded and full of whiny white suburban folk who will probably force management to change the Spanish words on the menu to English. Its gonna blow up once it catches on- get there fast!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop in Cleveland. This is my first time visiting and I was very impressed. The tacos were amazing, staff was very nice, and margaritas too good for just one."}
{"text":"The tacos and drinks are amazing. They don't even need anything else on their menu other than tacos. The place is super small and it can get quite loud, and the wait time can be brutal if you get there during happy hours. The tacos are 100% worth it, and I wish we had artisan tacos back home in Utah. I would eat here every day, all day."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm being a tad generous with five stars, but when you taste the Chicken and Waffles Taco and the Seasonal French Toast Bowl, you will forgive me. The taco is soul food sweet and savory heaven. The bowl is almost as good, but why argue about perfection? Both items are on the Weekend Brunch menu (Saturdays and Sundays 11am - 3 pm). Hopefully, they'll find there way to the everyday menu because I could eat both EVERYDAY.   I ate here for dinner on another night and enjoyed the experience. The main dining room has a festive Dios de Los Muertos look that goes well with the crowded and noisy nature of the place. Great for groups, inexpensive and okay for children. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I love the option of making your own tacos. I'll admit my creation was kind of strange, but all of the different toppings seem to work out perfectly.  There were plenty of options that were vegetarian friendly, as well as other dietary restrictions. All dietary options were clearly laid out on the menu. Hands down, probably the best tacos I've ever had. Our server was nice and attentive and explained everything to us since we had never been there before. Cannot wait to go back the next time I'm downtown for a game."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this place but here's what happened the last time I went - and I mean the last! It was my mom's bday and super cold out. no one was sitting at the table by the door. The waitress made a big deal about how it wasn't that cold and we should take that table. I should have left then. I asked if we could have one of the empty tables in the back. She said they needed to be cleaned and we said we'd be happy to wait. She scurried off to clean it. When she took us over, the waiter started giving us attitude because I wanted to try my sauces on the side - which I had done the dozen other times I'd been there. It was a bad experience. On my moms bday. The food wasn't that great that day either. My friends and I used to come here for happy hour. I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"Service was awful. My food was cold when I got it. Our bill was wrong and the waitress tried to fix it twice - never got it right. We also ordered food to go. Took 40 minutes to get it and the order was wrong."}
{"text":"Went to a Mexican restaurant with my wife and it was bad. All around bad. We knew we should have eaten at Barrio. After eating at a horrible place, we walked around the corner, waited an hour in line, and ate something else to get better food taste in our mouth :) You live and learn and remember that there's a reason places like Barrio are packed all the time and some others are not.  Barrio is literally the best restaurant in Cleveland, Ohio. I recommend it to everyone! Barrio is like Disneyland for Adults featuring tacos and good food all around. I don't think my wife and I have ever had a bad experience at any Barrio. The downtown restaurant location is our favorite to eat at, but every single location we've ever gone to has been amazing, every single time. If you have not tried out Barrio, YOU ARE MISSING OUT.   Go. Right now. Drop what you are doing. And go eat the best Tacos ever created. #Amazing"}

{"text":"I wish I could give this place negative stars. I'm in town for work and seeing that this place was next door and had good reviews I thought I would try it. I ordered the guacamole which was really a large piece of avocado with extremely salty guac around it. The piece of avocado was so hard I couldn't even pierce it with my fork ..I mean how is this even possible? Next came the el filidelpia with rubbery steak and a weird mix of other items that should be be put together. This place is terrible...save your money. I don't know if the food in Chicago have spoiled me but I ended up throwing out everything and going to hodges."}
{"text":"Amazing guac, great tacos, tasty drinks...I think we've found our newest taco joint (and I say this as someone who once spent a whole week in Austin, Texas eating nothing but tacos)! The house salsa that came with the perfectly crispy, fresh chips was worth going for just by itself."}
{"text":"I hate this place and everything it represents. It is a hipster bastardization of tacos. I wouldn't be so outraged if the tacos tasted good at least, but they don't. I have tried every possible concoction because friends keep wanting to come here, and I have never eaten one single good taco. The only good thing about this place is the Carolina Reaper & the strong drinks so 2 stars for them."}
{"text":"This is my favorite of all the Barrio locations (except on game day).  It's big, service is great, the drink and tap selection is huge, they have gluten free beer for celiacs like me, and the tacos are great!  The late night happy hour is great too.  When if first opened, service was a little rough/slow, but I think everyone's gotten the hang of the massive bar.  Service is always quick and friendly too.  I especially love that servers know the menu and are willing to check with the kitchen about ingredient questions without hesitation.  I'm celiac and gluten destroys my insides, literally, andI questioned why the cheese was not listed as gluten free.  Turns out they just wanted to be safe in case they ever have to use pre-shredded cheese that used flour as an anti-caking agent. Since they normally shred the cheese themselves, it's safe for me to eat.  Although, the smoked cheddar might not be gluten free and that's understandable.  This place only turns into a mess during home games, but only because of the crowd.  It gets packed to capacity and that just ain't my scene.  If you don't like long waits for a seat and wall-to-wall people, avoid it immediately before and after a home-game.  Like all Bario locations, I wish the bowl option didn't cost an extra $1 for what seems like the same amount of food as a regular taco, and I wish they had nachos.  I can use the bowl option and the free tortilla chips to DIY some nachos, but it's not the same because you won't have the gooey mess of cheese like normal nachos.  Even with those complaints, I love this spot."}
{"text":"Everyone's reviewed this place to death, so I'm not going to rehash it all.  The tacos are good.  I've never had bland tacos... I've never had bad food period.  Well, the chaco taco wasn't all that awesome--seemed like it had been in the freezer a while.  The guac was just ok, not awesome.  But ouside of that, the food is great.  The service is hit or miss.  I've had it be amazing, and I've had it be a little poor (slow and without much attention).  I've found it best to sit at or near the bar to get proper attention.  Speaking of the bar, I'm a fan.  They got a good selection of the hard stuff.  the beer selection isn't amazing, but it gets the job done quite well.  I don't need hundreds of beers from which to choose, just a selection of quality items.  They have some quality items.  It works.  Overall, I enjoy the place.  That's why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"The place was upbeat and the drinks were really good. The margaritas we ordered were excellent. But tacos were very disappointing. Coming from Texas, and having eaten so much Mexican food, authentic and Tex-Mex, I was sorely disappointed. I had tried their chicken and shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Best Tacos Ever.   I mean really? Check this place out.   Build your own tacos is the best idea ever. Their braised beef - must have crack in it, because I'm surely addicted."}
{"text":"Every single time this place is amazing! Their jalapeño margarita is my absolute favorite and is actually pretty spicy!! I love that you can create bowls out of your favorite tacos and can also create original bowls/tacos with all of their ingredients! Right now they have a really good falafel taco on their specials menu that I'm obsessed with!!!!"}
{"text":"I love that you just pay for what you want, not a bunch of sides that you may or may not want. Service is always great..BEST house margarita in Cleveland (in my humble opinion).  I definately recommend...This place puts Zocalo to shame."}
{"text":"Good Food, good service and reasonable prices...  What's not to like.  I would come again.  It's also Family friendly.  If you like Guacamole, then this is the place!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Tremont location and was very excited to hear that they were opening a location just around the corner from my apartment downtown.  It took MONTHS longer to open than expected and I can tell that they are still working out the kinks - bar service was slow the first time I went, the entire tap system was out the second time, but by my third and fourth visits things seem to be going more smoothly. Yes, I've visited 4 times in the couple of weeks they've been open - the grub is worth it!  Happy hour is a great deal - half off margaritas and whiskey, dollar off drafts,  dollar off tacos. You have to be sitting in the bar area so just ask for a table there. Their margaritas are great, but the long whiskey menu really surprised me and whetted my happy hour appetite.  If you aren't familiar with Barrio, you build your own tacos with a checklist separated out into shell type, filling, topping, salsa, sauces.  They also have a list of premade favorites. I'm not a vegetarian but for some reason prefer meat free tacos so I almost always get the marinated mushroom filling with the jicama slaw and raw onions for crunch, the salsa verde for heat (one of my favorite things in life and theirs is fresh and delicious) and the pesto to add a little garlic zing. I could easily eat 4 tacos but try to limit myself to two with the free chips and salsa to fill me up. If I'm feeling indulgent I love the stoner queso - their regular queso with rice in it - I thought it'd be weird the first time I tried it, but it makes for a thicker texture that is really nice.  I've also been for the Saturday brunch. The Bloody Maria was absolutely the highlight. (A Bloody Mary made with tequila). Perfectly spiced with a thick salt and pepper rim, garnished with a thick slice of bacon, cheese, and olive. Our waitress warned us that the bacon was addicting - after one thick-cut, crisp, peppery bite, I knew she was right! For brunch I had the shrimp and grits, which were cooked nicely but could've used a little more spice. I also had one of my usual tacos because I like what I like. My dining companions tried the brunch tacos and found them satisfying.  I think the downtown location will keep getting better with time and the service is already improving. Bottom line is the ingredients are fresh and the tacos make me smile - will definitely keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Have been going to Barrio's pretty much weekly for the last month/moth and a half. The first time eating at Barrio's was at the Cleveland Heights location. Great food and service, then tried Barrio's in Tremont and Lakewood, same great food and service. Returned back to the Cleveland Heights location last night ( 9/3) and two weeks prior to this. The service was slow both times. Last night was seated right away on the patio, but then took the waiter at least 10 if not 15 minutes to come to the time. Was about to just get up and leave. Ordered queso for the chips that took about 10-15 minutes to come after ordering. Food was alright but not as great as it has been the first couple times we had Barrio's/"}
{"text":"I walked in one thursday around noon and the hostess had the nerve to ask me if I needed a table.. as if I'm stupid and didn't know how to seat myself ! I found the fast service to be terribly inconvenient.. I didn't even have time to steal a bottle of hot sauce before my tacos were out. As for the food.. too good to be made that quickly. It has to be a lie. Over all an awful experience. If you like good service great food and hundreds of baskets of chips this is the perfect place for you. I just couldn't stand it..  What's up with that playlist ?"}
{"text":"Barrio was well worth the trip to Tremont from our eastern suburb. The salsa was very tasty, as was the queso and guacamole we tried. Everyone designed their own tacos and they were all a huge hit. Our server was more than patient with our numerous questions. A great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Well of course I had to try the new Barrio in Willoughby.  I've been to the one downtown and loved it.  I met some of my girlfriends for happy hour. The restaurant is SO loud you can't even talk across the table let alone to the person next to you.  I ordered one of the special tacos and it was just okay.  I also ordered one of the small bowls and that was good.  Drinks were fine and waitress was good, very attentive.  If it weren't for how loud it was I would give it a better rating.  Not sure if I would go back to this location.  Zero ambiance!!  I miss Olivor  Twist (old restaurant in this location)."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get some good margs and good food. The price is right and food is yummy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when we are downtown. You can make your own taco combinations or you can try one of the suggested combos. My favorite is the shrimp tacos! You would think that you need a few of these to fill you up, but one and half and I am stuffed. I have tried a few different combos and all have been decent, but the shrimp are by far my favorite."}
{"text":"I love them so much the best tacos ever! Friend service and fresh chips and salsa every time I come. Great bar selection and the best thing about it is you make it your way. Love the bar area and it's really homey. It's a one of a kind business and I live for the chorizo white widow with mild sauce x cheese and jicama slaw omg the die for! Love these guys xoxo"}
{"text":"We stopped in today for a late lunch and found the place hopping. The menu consists of special tacos or the option to build your own. There is a good selection of tequilas, mixed drinks, and beer. The hubs and I started with the regular guacamole which was a good sized portion for two. The chips and salsa that were complimentary were good: warm, crunchy tortilla chips with a chunky, smoky salsa. The guac was a miss for me on seasoning. It needed more salt, acid, and spice. It included jalapeños but I couldn't taste that heat. In terms of tacos, I got a special and built my own. I got the El Peurco with pulled pork and chipotle honey in a flour tortilla inside a hard shell. I love pulled pork but again this was a miss for me. The pork didn't have a lot of flavor and the meat was room temp. I didn't finish it. \"My\" taco was really good though. I had the braised beef with grilled onion and peppers in a flour tortilla with chipotle creama. Yummy! The meat was piping hot and well seasoned. The onions and peppers added some sweetness and the creama gave it that warm heat.   Our server was very nice and attentive. Overall, this was a good quick meal but your satisfaction is really dependent on what you order."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Def my fav mexican joint in the CLE area. superrrrrrrrrr cute set up & great patio.  The salsa and queso dip were fab and the build your own taco concept was so fun! The fish tacos were the best Ohio has to offer. The special sauce was so spicy and the rice and bean combo was delish. Awesome margartias and super friendly staff. This place was PACKED on a thursday @ 8pm & i can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love barrio. I'm a regular and this is my go-to place for tacos in Cleveland. That being said, I will say that dining experiences have varied. I've been there a lot, probably close to 20 times. If it's busy, good luck, there is virtually no where to stand and wait in the narrow bar area. Several times I have been seated in the bar area after waiting, and the other patrons are standing so close to your table they may as well join in on your conversation and meal.   If you can get a table on the restaurant side, good for you. The atmosphere is very casual and a good place to come for drinks (margaritas oh yes) and they have a nice variety of beers both on draft and bottle. The tacos, well, I'm obsessed. I do think it depends on what you get though, I recommend the shredded beef.   Servers have generally been very good.  Overall, go on a weeknight and avoid the mass chaos."}
{"text":"Absolutely addicting! Cheap, delicious and always great service whether at the bar or sitting down to dine I have absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. I live right by the Lakewood Barrio so I used to eat there all the time. I've had really inconsistent food the last several times I went. The brisket, which I used to order every time, has been so salty it's inedible the last three times I got it. The tacos frequently don't come out as ordered. I hesitated to give Barrio just a three star rating, but I just can't justify any higher until they get their quality back up to the old standards."}
{"text":"Long waits. Below average tacos. Expensive margaritas. Hipsters everywhere. Dont get why its so \"cool\""}
{"text":"So when people told me this place was amazing i had to try it. It's crowded and super loud. The interior is awesome. It's day of the dead themed, with a large pAtio area. But the food was a  * big fart sound* 3/10.  Sloppy wet tacos with bad topping options. Just did not blow my mind for the money. But great place to drink and have queso!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Stop by on Wednesday, Heather and Francesca work and are both super friendly. Specialty queso is always out of this world!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hot dogs are to Happy Dog as tacos are to Barrio!  Barrio has truly been a gift to the East 4th area. It's only been open for a few weeks, but I've been there enough to call myself a regular. You can't beat margs and tacos!  I opted to create my own tacos, which turned out to be fantastic. The green goddess shell was my favorite taco shell. I filled it with all sorts of delicious things - shredded chicken, chihuahua cheese, mango salsa, and onions and cilantro. Try it...I would not lead you astray. I am also a big fan of fish tacos in a soft shell with onions, cilantro and the crema sauce.  Chris got the recommended tacos and was a big fan of the dirty taco, which surprisingly enough is a vegetarian option. Being the meat-eater he is, he opted to add some chorizo to it. If you like spicy, you'll like this.  As far as drinks go, I tried the sangria and was a huge fan. I also had a pear margarita, but found it to be a little too sweet. I'll be trying one of the other margarita flavors next time I go though!  The service was only so-so. We went on opening night and the server, while really friendly, was a little slow and forgot quite a few things. I think she was overwhelmed. Our second trip out, the waitress wasn't really sure of any of the specials.   I am hoping once the weather starts to warm up, they will consider adding a patio to this space. It would be a prime people-watching area during sporting events and concerts!"}
{"text":"Solid tacos, it's nice that they have some house ones but also build your own option. The salsa and queso are both great for snacking with chips, and margaritas are delicious and come in many flavors."}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. I love the \"create your own\" taco idea. I'm not a huge fan of their margaritas - too much of an alcohol flavor for me personally - but their happy hour deals are amazing."}
{"text":"Barrio Taco was a pleasant experience. Our server, Stefanie, was so pleasurable!! Makes all the difference in any restaurant visit!! Omg....making up your own taco is the BEST idea, plus it was so much fun! Natalie, Jason & Mark were on the food line, preparing our food and did an excellent job! The Rosa salsa is awesome, the cilantro lime suace..... There's a vast list of choices of salsas, cheeses, suaces, not to mention the choices of meats, poultry & Fish! If you enjoy a taco, this restaurant is a must! The ambiance is delightful.  #satisfiedcustomer  p.s. try pickled veggies. Yummy!"}
{"text":"First let me tell you that you are way better then the Lakewood location in my opinion. I understand you guys are a chain now and are in high demand.   It does really suck that you guys decided to become a chain. I think when the lakewood location first opened the food was fantastic. Because it wasn't yet a chain. Now, moving on to my evening at Barrio. The service was extremely slow and the wait staff seemed like they didn't want to be there. No one smiled, it was sad actually.   We placed our orders and when they arrived they were just thrown together. I know there are a lot of people out there that would like a messy taco. But, I'm not one of them. I ended up having to eat with a fork. Which ducked because I wanted finger food. (We crave that sometimes) but, the entire evening was a bust. The wait staff refusing to look even remotely happy they have a job, to messy tacos I had to eat with a fork. I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered their black bean tacos from the food truck at the Tallmadge Food Truck festival. They were so salty they were inedible."}
{"text":"Chipotle doesn't have anything on this place. The best tacos I have ever had in my entire life. the atmosphere is also great, staff is very friendly, and they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Took the short walk from the hotel for dinner. A coworker recommended  the restaurant. Very nice atmosphere with a friendly staff. The tacos are very tasty. I ordered two off the menu. There is an option to \"build your own\". There is a great selection of beer and other drinks. Definitely worth paying this place a visit if you're in town."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Definitely would recommend any of their queso & guacamole. Tacos are yummy too -- they are build your own so you really can only blame yourself if you don't love your flavor combo :)"}
{"text":"Best place for tacos in Cleveland. inexpensive, high quality ingredients, upbeat environment, trendy decor.  Great beer selection on draft.  Stoner taco with braised beef, red cabbage and tomatoes, barrio sauce, mild cheddar style cheese... Off the chain. Really really good ..."}
{"text":"I love the build your own tacos! They have great drinks, and awesome queso! Great prices too :)"}
{"text":"There is always a ridiculous wait and it is never worth it.  I have been to this location and others and have always found something to be wrong with my food. I am vocal about being vegan whenever I order, and the most recent time I have gone to this Barrio, I ordered the vegan stoner and had very little time to eat, I was almost completely through my tacos when I noticed that what I thought were savory mushrooms was actually massive chunks of steak."}
{"text":"They have good food and it's a different take on mexican. However, it is a swing or a miss day by day. Sometimes, they give you a quality taco. Sometimes it's fairly half-assed. There is no consistency. I do enjoy their food and unique flavors of margaritas. The place is always packed so expect to wait - there is never room at the bar so be prepared to stand. Definitely worth it for a $3 taco though."}
{"text":"Great tacos ,beer,service,and atmosphere. Enjoyed the patio and the front garage door opening up on a warm day."}
{"text":"I have been to Barrio SEVERAL times and I really need to give it an honest review. It is decent and just OK. The tacos are cheap and tasty; however, they are NOT authentic. Also, they are only good if you have an eye for picking the right ingredients for a build-your-own taco. Certain mixtures of ingredients and sauces are just not good. The margaritas are definitely tasty and adequately strong, but overpriced! The only time they are worth it is at Happy Hour. I am vegetarian and it makes me extremely angry that I have to pay extra for rice and beans on my tacos. These simple additions make an otherwise cheap taco quite expensive and definitely not worth the money. If I can't have beans for free, what's the point? The ambiance here is pretty cool and the new Fairmount location is spacious, that's nice."}
{"text":"So, I'm a regular here (says my yelp check-ins). Over the course of dining here several times, I've noticed some faults that you should all be aware of.   This weekend, I had some exceptionally bad service.   The waittress wasn't very attentive. She didn't bring us silverwear til the end of the meal, when my friend finally asked for a fork to eat her side of black beans. She never really checked on us either.   And something else I've always noticed every time I eat here (and I always forget before I go) is that service is generally slow. Be prepared to wait for your food. You would think they have all the taco components prepped and ready to assemble so that they could serve it up quicker. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas (for 4 of us) and we all basically had nearly finised our drinks before dinner arrived. We each got 2-3 tacos and nothing else.   I'm kind of torn because I totally loved it here until recently."}
{"text":"Update as of 4/8/18  Sadly this location continues to suffer. Drinks are not up to standard and bartenders are more interested in talking to each other about how hungover they are than interacting with customers. It feels a little like Vanderpump Rules without the cameras to justify why this is going on. Absence of management in any capacity at the downtown location. Continues to be a disappointment.   ------   Barrio downtown USED TO BE good. It kind of hurts my heart to write this because we were regulars-but no longer.   We came in again after moving downtown hoping things had changed but the service was terrible besides the red head at the bar and the bar itself was dirty. Honestly the whole place feels dirty now. It also took a much longer time to get food and check than previously. We miss the old crew. This used to run smoother.  We used to love this place so much. So disappointed in what It has become, clearly neglected by management. Hope they are reading this. Please revitalize downtown Barrio!"}
{"text":"Loved the tacos. Good food, good service and reasonably priced. Pretty famous spot too!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place based on some reviews and after seeing them on TV this week. I am here in Cleveland on business and was looking to explore the local fare as I always do. The tacos are not real tacos, this is more like Taco Bell with style, in fact, I think I had better tacos there then here. True Mexican tacos are half the size of these, the tortilla is warm and flavorful. The tacos also are not warm enough, the toppings sit on a cold station, so once you add onions and cilantro (to make it traditional and not other things they have on their menu) it will completely destroy it. I have ordered the desert taco and did not eat. It was rock solid and almost broke my teeth.  The environment is good, it is always packed, the wait can be long and I would not wait for this. Parking is also difficult."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Lunch before the Cav's playoff game. Good but.....They ONLY have TACOS. Huge selection of TACOS; you can build your own. This would be a great place for picky TACO eaters.  Fresh ingredients, wide selection of toppings.  This is a bar that happens to make really good Tacos."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food but \"hope\" gave use a bad taste in our mouth for horrible service. Hope for better next time"}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to belly up for an amazing taco.  guacamole choices are superb. different but delish. cheese queso. creamy delicious goodness. may i get more chips PUHLEEZE?! tacos. design your own. i mean how cool and fun is that? they have a monthly (weekly?) special or you can order your own. choose from so many different toppings and variations.  i usually always order 3, yes 3. i am a piggy. but as mentioned so many times, i like choices. i love being able to sample many things. tacos are inexpensive so this is totally an option. oh wait, did i mention the amazing margarita flavors???? i love different margs. i love all things tequila, so make you try one of each. kidding. but at least two.  barrio is fun, delicious and will always be on my list of places to hit up for tacos.  just a side note. they get super busy. so be prepared for a little wait ;)"}
{"text":"Barrio is awesome.  every location has provided a great experience.  I also had their truck come to my wedding for late night food.  Everyone was impressed, especially out of towners that got to experience just one of our local gems."}
{"text":"This is a cleveland must. Affordable. Fresh. Tasty. And unique. We've been in Cleveland only 2 weeks...  and have visited 3 times. The el jeffe, pulled pork, and coke marinated steak tacos are my favorite. You can make your own also. The queso and salsas are all great...and the guacamole with smoked tomato and goat cheese.....wow. great staff great service. Great decor."}
{"text":"Great environment. Mimosas are sized right with great flavors and my brunch taco was fantastic for a great price."}
{"text":"Design your own tacos, very good, very good quality foods and sauces for everyone's palette.   Good offering of whiskey's in addition to the traditional Margaritas and beers.  Best of all it is Inexpensive."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Fresh ingredients made your way.  Service is quick, flavors are bold.  Prices are perfect.  If you want a great atmosphere and like Mexican with a trendy twist, this is for you."}
{"text":"Wow, where do I start with Barrio...a true gem. The Lakewood one is pretty easy to miss, but once you find it, you'll never want to eat another taco or drink another margarita unless it's from here!  It has such a fun and chill vibe. A great place to catch up with some friends. The only downside: the extremely long waits, buuuut it's also a good thing because you know the business must be doing so well. I wish Cleveland had more restaurants like this.  My friend introduced me to Barrio and it quickly became our go-to spot every time I come home.  You get to build your own tacos-I HIGHLY recommend ordering the shrimp tacos with a guac+queso shell. It's both a soft AND hard shell taco with guac and queso in the middle. My mouth waters every time I think about it.  Their blackberry margaritas are on a whole other level. Also, they're half priced (around $4-5 each) if you order during happy hour!! Each taco is about $3-4.  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant and I can't wait to go back soon!!"}
{"text":"Good service, delicious tacos, but the margaritas left a lot to be desired. If you want a fun place for DIY tacos, its perfect. If you're looking for good margs, skip it and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Lakewood location as I usually go to Tremont. I was glad the parking was better here!! Food was as good as it always is, if not better. The guac was so creamy and delicious!! Even though it was crazy busy , as it was a Saturday,  Bartender Michael kept the busy bar area flowing seamlessly. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday afternoon, and while it was quite busy, the staff was on point. The food especially the guac, was outstanding! I love the decor! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very cool concept to build your own tacos. The variety of proteins, veggies, cheeses and salsa was incredible. Server hustled and good came out quick. Atmosphere was loud and fun. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"The best location with the best customer service is the one downtown. This location isn't really welcoming or pleasant at all. I ordered a taco and queso to go. The taco was fresh and phenomenal! However, I am trying to figure out did I order soup or  queso? (Pictures attached) I ordered the chorizo queso but when I opened it they failed to drain the terrible grease, leaving my queso tasting and looking like a greasy soup. It was awful!   I will never return to this location or recommend anyone to this particular location."}
{"text":"We love tacos and we tried this place. We ate here around 4:30 which I recommend because after 5pm it was a 2 hour wait. The tacos were amazing!! Can not go wrong here. Everythings great!!"}
{"text":"Nothing blew my mind here. I don't think its worth being on a waitlist. Thankfully, it was thursday and no wait. Always hear Barrio this and Barrio that from people. Nothing bad in the experience. It was nice to customize what you wanted. I wasn't blow away by the flavors or anything. There is a great craft beer selection though. That was probably the best part"}
{"text":"Update: the manager was very apologetic and said he would look into the kitchen process and make sure it was still as good as it should be."}
{"text":"Greeted right away and received a wonderful Manhattan, then otherwise ignored.  4 people behind the bar can't keep up and even recognize when Water is needed.  Miserable.  Also 30 minutes for two soggy tacos.  Male bartenders also got defensive and ignored me for the rest of the night.  Embarrassing response from a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the atmosphere, have had great service.  Especially love the Dirty Taco.  Only thing keeping this from a five star is some pretty sorry margaritas.  On a taco Tuesday, four of us (two light drinkers, two moderate drinkers) split three pitchers of the classic, and far as we could tell there was no alcohol in them.  I tried the Diablo at the Tremont location, and saw the bartender using Country Time Lemonade.  Was so sugary I couldn't drink it.    Go here, eat, enjoy... But stick to beer."}
{"text":"Went last weekend and enjoyed dinner on the patio with my family. It was our first time there. Food was good and it's cute the way you order your tacos. We had two pitchers of margaritas. The flavors were good but they seemed a little light on the alcohol."}
{"text":"who doesn't love barrio amirite. But duuuuuude. you need some more locations. the past 4 times i've wanted it, called to see how long the wait is cuz lately it's been crazy with the new menu, and i never am told anything shorter than a 45 min to an hour wait and then i end up not going. the 5 stars is cuz y'all are killin it with the food and i support the hell out of y'all but i'm gonna need you to throw in several locations across north east ohio so we can get a little bit of a shorter wait and you know damn well that's a good business move. Crocker park would be dope just sayin"}
{"text":"Mexican in Lakewood, OH?! Yes!!!!  I love this place.  Friends introduced me to this Barrio. Cute restaurant in downtown Lakewood. In nice weather make sure you request outdoor seating (people watching is stellar in this town).  Plenty of street parking and it's free after 6 pm.   The first time I visited we did order guacamole for the table. I must admit, it wasn't best. It need more seasoning and spice. It was bland. I asked for salt to add flavor. Needless to say , I was a little disappointed. Until they brought out my burrito bowls. WOW!!! The pollo was tender and seasoned perfectly. I also had a bowl with steak marinated with coca cola. Delicious! The jicama slaw paired with the pineapple salsa reminded me of my days hanging out in Southern California at the local taco shack.   The second time I visited I ordered the guac again.  Maybe the chef was just having an off day the first time I tried their guac. Well, he out did himself the second time around. It was tasty and seasoned perfectly. I gobbled over half of it before my friend joined me. He was shocked that I barely left guac for him. Oh well, you snooze you lose. Next time he won't be late for dinner. We sat outside and order tacos until my stomach was stuffed. I'm talking 4 tacos/burrito bowls per person. And these aren't small portions. All this food for only $20!   I'd give this Barrio 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us. It was packed when we got there so we sat at the bar. The beer selection was awesome as were the chips and queso. The tacos were good but the cold toppings of lettuce and tomato made the taco ice cold which was a little weird."}
{"text":"Decent gourmet tacos.   I was absolutely disgusted to pay $28 for a Margarita pitcher that had less alcohol than those rum chocolates grandma gives you at Xmas."}
{"text":"This place gets three stars from me because the tacos are so freaking good and the variety of choices is unreal. The price per taco is also very reasonable and I can easily have a full meal with three tacos. The drink prices a comparable to the area. The service is hit or miss. I have had great servers, I have had not so great servers. The hostesses are lousy, there is no way around it. They can be rude and are generally unhelpful. A couple of times there has been a wait with two or three tables visibly open around the bar area. Not only would the hostesses not sit anyone there, if you went over to those tables while waiting you were shooed away by them.   This place still gets a 3 star from me though, probably because I live close enough to go in and make to go orders."}
{"text":"Barrio has never disappointed. I love that they have rotating specials, so there is always something different to try. Their guac is the best around, and I love that they give you such a large portion, rather than just a tiny scoop. It's almost a meal in itself. You can't beat the price for the tacos, even when it's not happy hour - the chorizo is a favorite and most recently that they had a bay scallop taco that was absolutely delicious. I've enjoyed the margs before but they also have a terrific beer list. You really can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Went here with family and friends during a visit this summer.  Amazing!  The service is quick, although the tacos aren't hot when served.  They are kind of room temperature.  Nevertheless, the flavor and quality of the ingredients are top notch.  The prices are reasonable.  Parking is difficult and there is a bit of a wait.  The guacamole may be the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"During my lunch today, I take a sip out of my water. Their was something in my mouth afterwards, I took it out and was shocked to see that it was a piece of bitten off finger nail...it was even partially painted! I analyzed it to make sure it is what I thought and worked up the courage to ask for a manager (which I never do). She comes over and I present to her the nail, she stares at it and at first she said it was a died up piece of paper. Then she said that it was part of a lemon seed, which I had already ruled out that it wasn't. She was convinced that it was part of a lemon said and brushed it off like nothing was wrong. She proceeded to walk away laughing. Not to mention that it took ten minutes for the server to come and great us, and then proceeded to bring us the wrong food. This was such a terrible experience and I will never go to Lakewood barrio ever again."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and if I lived in Cleveland I would be a regular. The restaurant features a fun hipster vibe with graffiti art on the walls and both indoor and outdoor patio seating.  We walked in and of course there was a wait. It was about 20 minutes or so. We decided to grab a drink at the bar while we waited. The bar staff was lacking momentum. We stood there for a while before they acknowledged us. To their defense, they were busy, but a quick \"I'll be right with you\" would have sufficed. The drink prices were fair; my Skinny Skeleton margarita was about $8. It was good but nothing special. It lacked imagination; the garnish was a lime... The rest of the party ordered beer which were served in large mason jars.   We sat first available and ended up dining inside. Our server was friendly but didn't engage in conversation. When you sit down you select your food via a piece of paper. Each person dining writes their name at the top of the paper and circles in the tacos they want and lists the quantities. You can even make your own taco. The prices were fair. About $4 per taco and they were gigantic! I ordered one and it was plenty. Very unique and delicious! My only suggestion is the kitchen should write the taco type on each taco basket so if you order multiple tacos you know which is which. This will make it easier to determine which are your favorites when you come back.   While you wait they give you complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were crispy and fresh and their salsa was VERY good. We also ordered the Queso and the Bacon Gorgonzola Guacamole. Wow! Both were divine. The guacamole was very unique. I have never had anything like it.  I highly suggest checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I've been told this is the original barrio, but I'm not sure, either way, yayayyy barrio near me! I love the decor, and with a slogan of \"tequila, bourbon, tacos\" it's hard not to think this restaurant was made for me. All my favorite things in one place ! A little disappointed in the weak drinks. Maybe they've had a hard go with some guests, but I hate watching ice put into my glass then alcohol poured, rather than making the drink and mixing it with ice, Barrio is clearly diluting those cocktails! None the less, hard to beat the happy hour price of half of margs. Free chips and salsa too, oh my!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've only ever been to the one in Tremont once, but the food, the margaritas, and the service are all incredible. When I went, I was served very quickly, but the food tasted just as great as when I've had to wait during busier times. If you go to one place to eat in Cleveland, go here."}
{"text":"Been in Cleveland almost a week, and every time I come by, they are packed. Finally got a seat at the bar. Intriguing beer selection. Great tacos on El Jefe's Selecciones. My only complaint is the chips are super salty, no doubt part of a malicious plot to make me consume more liquids."}
{"text":"First time trying any Barrio and was NOT disappointed. I'm always down for tacos so when people kept suggesting this place, I had to try it. We went on a Saturday afternoon while it was pouring, so no outside patio. It was difficult to find a parking spot in the back because the area is pretty busy with restaurants. The place was pretty packed, but we got seated fast. They have a good selection of tacos, including vegan options. They also have a wide selection of beverages. The atmosphere, the wait staff and food were all really great. Just be prepared for it to be packed."}
{"text":"Very good. Went during happy hour. Got a couple tacos. The one with bacon was delicious. Total bill for two tacos and a margarita came to meet $10. Tacos are large... couldn't even finish the second one."}
{"text":"Tasty tacos and margaritas. Try the queso!"}
{"text":"Barrio is my favorite go to when I'm craving tacos and amazing queso! I've been a bit disappointed since they stopped carrying the pomegranate syrup for their margaritas, however I know that's not their fault something isn't being made anymore. Try the peach though. Perfect with some salt on the rim."}
{"text":"We have been here twice within a week for the Cavs Watch Party. Our first visit was Great! We sat out on the patio, the service was exceptional and the food was Awesome! I give this a 4 star because of our second visit. We only waited about 15 min for a table considering the place was packed. Just as packed as our first visit, but the service was less than stellar. Our first visit the waiter refilled out chips a few times even though our food came out right away, our second visit we probably sat at the table for over a half hour with empty chips and no food. I think the waitress could have atleast checked on us and kept us updated on our order. We finally get our food and of course they lost one of our orders, by this time we had to scarf down our food so we could get in line at the Q. I will return in hopes we can have just as good visit as the first one!"}
{"text":"Braised pork belly taco (one of the taco-of-the-month specials) was delicious. I liked the soft flour tortilla, great price point, and flavorful pork. Solid guac, nothing particularly special. We got a couple of pitchers of their margarita (plain lime, blood orange). Nic blood orange flavor, not too sweet, but both were on the weak side. I guess not a bad value for $24/ pitcher. Would come back again, at least for their cheap and tasty tacos. No issues with splitting the bill for our party of 8, very accommodating."}
{"text":"Barito oddly enough is a taco place not a burrito place. They have great beer and arlecart toppings for your tacos. The Carolina reaper hot sauce is awesome but if it's too intense no shame mixing with your salsa from your free chips and salsa. One thing to note is this place is hopping so expect to wait for your tacos."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to eat here. I stumbled upon this taco joint with my husband while in Cleveland. We were exhausted with the usual downtown Cleveland food scene, wanted something different and new, and found all that and more inside Barrio.   It's a build your own/pay per Taco menu situation, but the toppings range in typical to unusual and the end result is a tasty taco meal. In my experience they are a bit sloppy and wet, but I think that's part of the package. Don't wear your finest Haynes.  Take a paper menu, circle in all the topping that tickle your fancy and mark the number of tacos you'd like to eat. When they seat you, you get chips and salsa, so three tacos (@3.50 ea.) is plenty. You can add addition dips for your chips, but your tacos come in a timely fashion so don't get too full on the chips as they will offer more.  Order a tasty margarita to pair -- they come out in neat mason jars and are tasty. They have a pitcher option as well.  The servers have a funky flair, are quick, and offer their services if you've never been and need a bit of guidance on how to order or what some of the topping options are.  You can sit outside or in, I've had the pleasure of experiencing both. If you are not from Cleveland, or have never been, do not be alarmed as the bums do walk by, often offering to sell you a fake/plastic flower \"for lovers.\" Take it in. Don't let it ruin your experience. All cities have it. If it's something you don't want to see, even though you are right outside the Q, sit inside and enjoy the scenes of Cleveland after.  You're gonna be full and you won't stop even when you are. Take it all in because it's a funky little taco shop. You'll fall in love. Sloppy taco and all. We did! (We did not buy a flower \"for lovers.\""}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, great service, and open late on weekdays!  We got a pitcher of the paloma margaritas, which have a great grapefruit flavor and a bit of bubbly!  Tacos were delicious, we went with the build your own, but the house choices looked great too. Get the stoner shell, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I didn't try the food (have to do that other day) and I've heard mixed reviews on that, but as far as drinks and ambience go, this is a great Summer spot. Love the decoration inside and the patio outside. Typical Tremont peace of mind with enough buzz and conversation to keep you busy. I had a powerful spicy drink (Chupa-Cabras) which I recommend all the self-entitled brave people to try!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats. Some times they can be hit or miss, depending on the day and location. Still think the original location is the best one."}
{"text":"Fun live place on Saturday lunch. Seated immediately at full menu bar. Chips with guac to share plus excellent fish taco in a green goddess shell was all I needed for lunch. Veg taco was ok. Wasn't hungry anymore anyway. Look forward to returning and sitting outside. Less noise there."}
{"text":"A great meal as usual with my girlfriend, who is a Barrio fanatic. Sometimes at made to order places you over do it, but tonight I found the perfect blend of ingredients to make a darn fine taco. And I even gave their special taco a go and it was by far one of the best I've ever had there. It was called the Taco El Pastor. I highly recommend trying it before it's gone.   ***Gluten Free Tip*** I also learned tonight that if you're gluten free, they have a special soft corn tortilla that is not on the menu. When you order you can cross off the soft flour and put soft corn on there. The server said it's not on the menu and is just for people \"in the know.\" Consider yourself \"in the know\" now. I usually just get the hard shell, but this one was way better and I won't be going back to the hard shell.   It was packed per usual. If you've never been to Barrio, be aware that around 6 or 7 pm you will have to wait. There is usually around a 45 minute wait around that time for two. Today their were people hanging out up and down the street.   Our server was one of our favorites. His name is Tim G. according to the check and if you get him, you'll be happy. Super nice and accommodating with just the right amount of humor and wit and most importantly, he was on top of things.   We were boring tonight and did just the plain queso, and guac which are always crowd favorites and they didn't disappoint.   Overall it was a great meal and a great time."}
{"text":"Recommended by some family members.  I had two brunch tacos.  The smoked salmon taco was just ok.  The chicken and waffle taco was delicious.  I would visit again."}
{"text":"Food made us Sick.  My friend vomitted!   The experience is not our type of restaurant.   I got more food than I ordered.  Food tasted decent.   Walls are decorated with skulls.  Bar type of atmosphere."}
{"text":"first time there... nice on a cold weekday night.  Greeted warmly by hostess, server was able to explain all well  guacamole was fresh and what a traditional version should be but was ICE COLD... flavors were deadened.   ordered a tequila and a bourbon to sip. Tequila was fine, but the pour on the bourbon was ridiculously small... and it wasn't that rare of one either. It was even less on the second round.  tacos were really good and well made. I would explore more versions next time and skip the guac and stick with a beer."}
{"text":"Service - good, on it!  Food - Be mindful unless you like white onion by pass or order on the side, that is unless you love and want a whole diced onion. I had more onion than meat on two tacos. Could not eat, trashed that. Ordered a bowl, minus onions - perfect!"}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious! Drinks are delicious. Ambiance outside was nice. Service was great and very friendly.   We've been here a few times now and on our last visit, the taco of the month was a soft tortilla wrapped around a hard shell stuffed with braised beef, whole beans, some kind of BBQ sauce, and other deliciousness. It was crazy good. We've both never had a taco like it. I just love how the owner presents food that isn't redundant to other places. I also ordered two other tacos that were on the menu (didn't make my own) and they were delicious. We also got the regular quac which was super good, and the complimentary chips and salsa are yummy! I was still eating them after dinner when my stomach was full to capacity and I could hardly move. I know...but I couldn't help myself."}
{"text":"The overall experience I had here was not great. It's hard because I wanted to like this place. And I had heard such great things about it. First off, the service was terrible. While our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable about the menu, he was not very attentive. We sat on the outside patio and our waiter forgot about us. He didn't bring us our drinks or chips and salsa until after our food arrived! It was at least 20 min in between the times he came to check on our table. When we finished eating we sat there for 40 min just to get some to go boxes and pay the check. The food was not impressive either. I got the fish taco, which was defiantly the worst fish taco I have had. I also got a chicken taco which was just alright. To top off the experience our table was extremely wobbly and was impossible to eat on. Overall the best part of this experience was the chips and salsa (which were actually really good). Too bad we got them after we had eaten our food! Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Spent a weekend in Cleveland and went to this place twice. Great vibe, delicious food and margaritas, and at an awesome price. Bottomless chips and salsa upon arrival, build your own tacos for $4. Perfect for a group or a post-show bite after being in playhouse square."}
{"text":"Excellent, timely service.  The pomegranate margaritas were perfect after a long hangover.  The tacos were exactly what we ordered.  I would have ordered the pork belly special taco but did not see it on the menu until after.   The only complaint I had is the taco was overloaded with  too much sauce for me.  Five out of five overall."}
{"text":"What can I say about Barrio that hasn't already been said. Amazing tacos, amazing staff, and amazing atmosphere. The tacos are Always tasty. Barrio has definitely become a staple of Cleveland. One of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about Barrio that hasn't already been said. Great tacos, great margaritas, and great service. Barrio will always be my favorite Taco place!"}
{"text":"Who said Ohio City gets to have all the taco fun! Barrio may be in it's infancy but that infant is a mutha f*****!   The 'Casa Margaritas' were flowing this weekend as they opened their doors for the first time, a dawn of a new era for a building at \"The Heart of Tremont\"  as stated in in stained glass adorned behind the bar.  The decor is less Mexican Folk Art and more chic Dia de los Muertos -- sprawling murals in the dining room, beautiful wood in the bar, and one of the BEST patios in Tremont.  Atmosphere is casual & versatile.   The bar is stocked with Tequila, Whiskey & craft beers.  There is a Don Julio that I have my eyes fixed on but for now I've been touring their specialty margaritas.  Two of my favorites, so far,  are the sweeter Marygold-- which has prickly pear, grand marnier, blood orange ect and the crisp Jade O... something, I can't remember the name-- which is more refreshing, think a mojito w/ tequila instead of rum.  You can also get flights to sample the tequila & whiskey (whisky?)   What I ordered:  I built my own taco-- reminiscent of  Happy Dog's method or checking off your toppings.  It was awesome! corn tortilla, jicama slaw, habanero bbq sauce....grilled TOFU!  (finally, a place that gets... sometimes you need more protein than a black bean in your taco!)  I believe you can build up to 4 different tacos in an order, so it was perfect for my husband & I to mix & match.    If you're not feeling ambitious to build your own, they have specialty tacos fixed on the menu.  Along w/ Salsa, Guacamole (oh the guac!)  and a bunch of other stuff that will make meat  eaters salivate.    My only critique is  that they have a couple new restaurant wrinkles to iron out, but once those are tightened up -- grand things are in store for Barrios future!"}
{"text":"Love it.... Great food. Great Rita's. Just wished it was open for lunch during the week."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of 9 at noon on a Saturday. Waited an hour for a table that never happened. Bar tender had a major attitude. This sucks because I really liked this place. Walked out and had great food and service at buckeye beer engine."}
{"text":"Barrio is a great spot. I'm in town for a conference and the proximity of Barrio to most hotels can't be beat. I came right before a Indians have ended and I had no problem getting a table. Service was prompt and I was seated quickly.   The venue...its gives me hipster catina vibes. Cool artwork on the walls that commemorate dia de muerta.   The service is fine. I was frustrated by the lack of expansion on the uniqueness of the menu. We fumbled through.the ordering process with no guidance from our server. Honestly, the few questions we asked...seemed as though we were troubling the server.   I came twice in a single day, not because the food was that earth shattering but its a cool concept when you have people from out of town.  The food... Barrio is a Which Wich meats your favorite taco spot. You grab a order sheet and build your own taco. You pick everything from the type of shell to, cheese, protien, toppings, salsa, and sauces.    The drinks... We had a picture of maragritas..They were good. Not very strong but no complaints . There is a full bar. They can make anything.   All in all. Good spot. SUPER CHEAP. Id return (well I already did...later that day)."}
{"text":"While staying at the Cleveland Marriott Downtown, my wife and I decided to try Barrio in the general downtown area. We walked over and were seated quickly (despite it being busy). The vibe is one of a fun bar with some cool decor, and it was packed for lunch during the Saturday that we dropped in.   The ordering system is pretty straightforward - you are greeted with chips and house salsas, then proceed to order appetizers and the build-your-own tacos. We ordered the traditional guacamole and queso blanco (so good!) to munch on with the chips and salsa.   For tacos, I ordered three soft flour tacos with the following ingredients: Coca Cola marinated steak, and 2 of the marinated chicken. Queso fresco. Chipotle crema. Lettuce and tomatoes. The three tacos were more than enough to satiate the craving and leave me stuffed.  We enjoyed Barrio enough to take my wife's cousin the next day when she was looking for a good lunch option. Definitely a recommended taco joint when in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I've been visiting Cleveland for a week for work, and me and some coworkers came by one night for dinner. It was so good that I just had to come again. The build yourself tacos idea is brilliant and super easy. Food and service was great. If I'm ever in Cleveland again, I will definitely be coming back for more"}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars for the taste, but the atmosphere was a little lacking, so overall I'm giving it 3.  A friend and I came in late on a weeknight for a couple tacos. The place was packed, but we were able to get seated promptly. The service was pretty sub-par though. The host didn't say a word to us, and barely looked at us...we figured she wanted us to follow her when she had walked halfway across the restaurant with 2 menus, then stopped and looked back at us with her eyebrows raised like we should have read her mind to follow her. Our waitress was nice, but our order was wrong (despite writing it down)...all we ordered was 2 beef tacos and 1 chicken taco. The place was very loud, and felt very dirty.  Nonetheless, the chicken was cooked well and the tacos themselves were great. The guacamole was average. I would maybe consider coming back with a big group of friends if others wanted to go, but not just for the food."}
{"text":"I miss barrio now that I live back on the east coast.  The tacos here are amazing and the queso dip. . .i have dreams about the queso dip."}
{"text":"Okay, so I thought everyone was overdoing it with the compliments on this company. I went to the new location in Willoughby. Wait time was an hour so we left to go have a drink at Corks down the street while we waited. Came back, got a table, they just opened so it was a bit crazy with the wait staff. I'm not an adventurous eater and I got the pulled pork, bacon, smoked cheddar, lettuce soft taco and the marinated steak, chihuahua cheese, lettuce soft taco. Side of sour cream and guacamole. They look kinda small but YUMMMMMM!!! Sooo good! Very filling! Pulled pork and marinated steak had great flavor! Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"After an afternoon of shopping, a friend and I decided we were craving tacos, so we made the drive to Barrio!   If you walk away from this review remembering only one thing, it should be this: get the Stoner shell.   When we walked in, Barrio was super crowded (happy hour will do that), but we were able to be squeezed into a table for two immediately. Not much seating room, so I was constantly getting bumped by the table behind me and we were trying to make ourselves as small as possible! Since it was so crowded, our waiter took a while to arrive, by which point we had already filled out our order forms. Protip: bring a pen or pencil into Barrio. It'll make your life easier.   To start the meal, we each ordered a margarita to go with our chips and salsa. The margarita was pretty good, but the flavors didn't really stand out. It tasted more like a regular margarita than blood orange (hers) and pomegranate (mine). The same for the Marygold's, which sounded tasty, but didn't have much flavor.   I adore chorizo, so I immediately gravitated towards that when building my tacos. All the options can make it a bit overwhelming, so I appreciated the suggested tacos, but those didn't have the ingredients that called to me, so I tried my hand at making my own. Definitely fun! I loved being able to pile up a couple of the salsas and toppings :)   The tacos appear small when they come out, but they are filling. I ended up eating four (I caved and got a special after I had already made my orders and then I'm pretty sure they messed up one of my tacos, so I remade it), and I almost regret that decision. Almost. But seriously, two is enough. Favorite components: the stoner shell, the chipotle crema, and the chorizo.   Quick summary: loud, potentially overwhelming, and the margaritas are underwhelming, but building your own taco is super fun and they present an opportunity for some very creative combinations! GET THE STONER SHELL.   Barrio is a place I have to visit again just to try all the possible taco combinations!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love tacos? (well... as it turns out, one person from my group, but anyway back to the review) About 11 friends and I skipped in before last call, thrilled to find food after a bar crawl that could appease most of our crowd. So what does a somewhat tipsy crowd need after a loud night out? Cheap, tasty tacos, and a lot of water (plus a few more beers).   The beer list was amazing - the beer snobs and the beer confused were all equally happy. Our waitress was friendly and helpful after a Friday night crowd, so I'm sure that we saw her at her complete worst (and we still thought she was amazing). The crowd next to us kept posing for picture after picture, and she even offered to take their pictures (joke had to be on her because once she took one, they had to keep taking a multitude of pictures). The waitress explained the menu like one would to a toddler (which to be fair, your average toddler has more brain power than one in our group), which was actually way appreciated.  The guac did look like it was at the end of its night, which to be fair it likely was. It was dished up in little plastic cups and I noticed not just mine but my friend's was brown on top. It was still tasty, and I don't know that anyone else noticed the slightly off color - which is normal and what guac tends to do if it isn't super fresh.   Our food came out fairly quick, and the server was happily dishing out extra water. While I'm not usually one to frequent downtown, especially for a drink, Barrio hit the spot. Despite being after 1am, they weren't completely full (I don't often get to the other Barrio due to the wait)."}
{"text":"I have been to this barrio and the one on literary road and I suggest you avoid this location at all costs. Not only is the outdoor seating minimal I promise you food poisoning is included with your taco- not sure whether it's the corn salsa or the guac but 2/2 times I've been here I've been violently ill for the following two days. Treemont barrio does not seem to have problems handling their food."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. Only one experience but it was great. I did build your own, but my wife got the El Jefe from the standard menu.  They might be the best tacos she's ever had. Go there. Sangria was also great."}
{"text":"Just stepped in for a quick drink at the bar. This place was hopping on a Wednesday night! Decorated with skeletons all over the place, decor was sweet and service was quick."}
{"text":"The food was good, a little overrated for all of the reviews on here. BE WARNED it's definitely a younger hipster crowd. I brought my mom and grandma here and they said that they felt old and out of place and were completely uncomfortable. That being said, the food was good, I highly recommend the portobello mushrooms in your taco."}
{"text":"Oh mama. Lakewood is beginning to get so stuffed full of awesome restaurants that I'm going to have to go to Kohl's soon (the only place white guys shop) to get bigger pants. Barrio en Lakewood is no exception. Checked out this place a few Thursdays ago and was instantly charmed. Decor and service is both exactly what you'd want it to be in a place like this -- no muss, no fuss, just solid. The concept is pretty much Happy Dog For Tacos -- you fill out a form and get exactly what you want, prepared to order. And pretty much all tacos are three bucks. As to another reviewer complaining that it was too high a price: are you on crack? Even the grodiest of grody items at Taco Bell are, like, two bucks. You really can't pony up that extra buck for a taco so good it'll melt your face off? Due to some sickness on my part, I didn't get any drinks, but I look forward to getting drunk here soon."}
{"text":"This place is always a place that you can rely on. A place that has kept it simple for a long time. There are always plenty of options to order exactly what you want. There's no confusion because it's written down for what you want to order. I could imagine eating here before a sporting event or concert in the summer, only problem is I'd be rooting for the other team."}
{"text":"yummy !!! can't wait for the new one to open in willoughby...only bad thing is because everyone likes it so much, long waits :("}
{"text":"Honestly, this is some of the best \"Mexican\" food I've had in Cleveland. It not authentic by any means, but I love the way it is set up. Build your taco with some great choice like quest fresco, house made chorizo, and the dipping quest for the chips is awesome. I really loved this place and I plan to be a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour and totally digging the deals. HH 4-7pm. They have daily specials like whiskey wednesdays with half off whiskeys. For general deals, $1 off tacos (so they're $2) and most of their margaritas are half off so they're as low as $3. Their tacos are craft your own by checking off the ingredients on a piece of paper and handing it to them. For the protein choice on tacos, I tried the house made chorizo, grilled chicken, and fish of the day - all with their difference selections of sauces and salsa. SO good! I'm glad that there is a Lakewood location closer to my apt bc it is definitely a worthwhile happy hour to return to."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I live in Texas.. San Antonio to be exact.. And I was visiting CLE for work. When my coworkers wanted to take me to a taco joint for lunch I looked at them like they were crazy. I live in SA where tacos are their own food group where they are eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. But, I decided to pursue the adventure. I figured I can't knock CLE tacos without trying it first.  We arrived on a Friday during lunch time. It was a beautiful 60 degree sunny day and the place was packed. We sat on the patio within minutes and I was getting a crash course on the menu from my coworkers. Meanwhile, the waiter never.. I repeat never.. Came over to ask us for water or help with the menu. If it wasn't for my coworkers I would have been lost on what to order/how to order.    Moving on, 15 minutes later, the waiter still never came by for our order or drinks at least. I was very disappointed and this was my first impression. We finally get up and ask for our waiter. He came by and gave us water. He didn't ask if we wanted anything else to drink or asked if we had questions with the menu. I did not get his name as he never introduced himself to us. Nonetheless, We gave him our orders and the food was promptly served. I will say the chips and salsa that are provided are amazing! Tangy, but sweet with a hint of spice. We ordered the pineapple guacamole and queso. Both items I highly recommend.   The tacos are delivered to the table wrapped in foil and with a fork on the side. In Texas this is not common, but I pursued onward. The tacos overall weren't bad, but they were messier than I was expecting. I was impressed with the \"stoner\" which is a flour tortilla wrapped around a crispy taco with queso and chorizo in between (let your mouth finish watering after that comment).   1 star for ambiance and patio - If I wasn't there for lunch with coworkers then I would have definitely enjoyed a margarita or two.   1 star for pineapple guacamole, queso, chips and salsa.    1 star for the \"stoner.\"  0 stars for service - Overall, they need to improve on their customer service.  0 stars for serving tacos with a fork - This is just not necessary.   Would I come back for appetizers and drinks after work?: Absolutely!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun, relaxed, and great service. They bring out chips and salsa which are amazing and we always order the guacamole. It's hard not to fill up on chips and dip. The chili lime tofu is amazing and I love that you create what you want."}
{"text":"The other locations blow but this one I have had no problem with even after a few different visits.  The tacos are always good but sometimes...not hot.  The drinks are ridiculously overpriced.  Beers are OK, but an 8.00 drink in a bullshit undersized mason jar is nuts.  I don't care if its got eagle tears in it.  If ya pay that much for a drink your smoking crack.  The servers are always nice and not in a fake-kinda way either.  As soon as they open the place is packed with millennial kids who dress like they were on the show Blossom.  Brought my Dad (whom has trouble walking) and the little shits were to occupied playing on their phones and putting their names on the wait list for a patio seat to help with the door or even get the hell out of the way.  Not the restaurants fault, just parents my age raising twats for kids..."}
{"text":"Ya know what??   Eff this place.  We came here after a gathering on a Monday night.  Dimebag Darrel wanabe never even looked up at us or said Hi.  But he sure as hell took the tips we left.  If its dead and you wana be a miserable prick..THEN CLOSE.  I know its hard pouring IPA into an undersized jelly jar.  If people wana spend money then be nice and stay open.  If you wana jerk off to Golden Girls reruns, then close...."}
{"text":"Obsessed! So good. Always pretty crowded but never have to wait too long. Good food, good service. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Just awful - one step above Taco Bell - well, actually, Taco Bell is better.  Had a taco with \"sirloin\" - more like greasy ground beef...  Felt like I needed my stomach pumped after.  And, to top it off, unfriendly service!"}
{"text":"I was there again last friday night and i ordered the guacamole with some pineapple and it was pretty disgusting, even my friends agreed with me i also ordered 3 tacos with marinaded on coca cola or pepsi or something like that 4 dollars for a taco, they were cold and not good at all my previous review i gave them 4 stars but i was pretty drunk and i thought the food was good.  This time i was sober and i realized that i made a mistake the service was slow and the place its too loud, i'd be back only if im drunk again !!!"}
{"text":"Finally, got a chance to eat here, after all the reviews & hype I was pumped for something spectacular. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The tacos were mediocre at best, the service was abysmal, the waitress was ridiculous & could not seem to find out why 4 tacos took over an hour, the drinks were small & over priced. And on top of all that the restaurant  wasn't even full."}
{"text":"My friends and I checked in during its second week of operation.  It was very busy at 9 PM.  We got a table for six quicker than I had thought.  It was slow to get our orders; but it was understandable as our server Jay was friendly and patient.  Myself and two of my friends are blind and he read us the menu; your web site is not totally accessable for our screen readers.  Chips and salsa of different varietieis are plentiful at our table and it was comfy.  I don't care for bar stools, but that was our only option for seats last night.  We got several different tacos; I ordered a la carte with the white widow soft taco filled with shrimp on one, mahi mahi on the second and chicken on the third.  I also got a side of Carolina reaper sauce.  They diluded the sauce to my surprise and I was not happy; I love spicy food and wanted to feel the pain of the hottest pepper sauce in the world!  Either way, Barrio's new location in Cleveland Heights will be our group's first or second restaurant choice after our Bible study lets out on Thursdays.  Ya'll are wonderful.  I also forgot about the excellent and crazy amount of margarita selections and full bar that was quite decent."}
{"text":"We loved this place! The build you own tacos had so much variety it was hard to choose! Also the happy hour is fantastic with half off margaritas."}
{"text":"Went to barrio for happy hour on Friday. Unfortunately, it was so busy we weren't able to get a spot at the bar, so we weren't able to get happy hour specials which sucks.   Besides that, the margaritas were great (on the rocks definitely tasted stronger than blended!) and the tacos were delicious. The stoner upgrade was okay, kind of messy and made it hard to eat but it was good."}
{"text":"I went with a group of around six of us, just around 10pm this past Monday night. It wasn't crazy busy--there were several empty tables on the patio and the complete back of the restaurant inside was empty. We asked to be seated on the patio.  Our server was obviously having a rough night. She dramatically drug two tables together for us and slammed the extra chairs on top of each other. It was the complete opposite experience of Ronald F. If it weren't for the assurances of my friend who had already been about the food, I at least would have left immediately because of my first few interactions with the waitress. We weren't really greeted at all and I don't think she smiled once the whole night. Maybe it was because we were on the patio, but I only ever saw one waitress working there--ours.  It definitely appeared that they were low-staffed, but they didn't communicate this or ask for understanding/patience.   Our waitress didn't ask us if we had ever been there before. It was my first time. I had to rely on my friend to explain the menu to me, and on the tortilla options, he was mixed up (I'd never seen the options of blending corn & flour tortillas at a place like this). This would have not happened if the waitress had taken two minutes to go over it. Our waitress didn't make any suggestions or ask questions to help us understand what we were wanting. She gave no information of specials, drinks, etc.   It took a while, and once our food finally came, two of the ingredients I ordered on one taco were missing. Due to the lack of those ingredients, they shoved it with a bushel of shredded lettuce. I was so hungry, I ate a few bites but it was literally like eating a plain flour tortilla with a mouthful of plain iceberg lettuce, that couldn't hide behind being doused in a salsa or sauce. I didn't have a chance to do any research on Barrio's before our visit but I agree with M.M. & Stephanie B. There was hardly any meat in the taco, especially one of them (I could barely find it!).  Also, like Stephanie B., the Stoner taco was super soggy. I understand that chorizo is going to be greasier and more wet than, say, the smoked chicken, but I've never been served such a soggy taco. I scraped it off the moment I got it & ate it without it.  Throughout the night, we had to ask for more of everything like water, salsa and chips. This might have been able to be overlooked, but combined, with the monotone, smile-less service I just couldn't give this place more than one star for the experience altogether."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place!  We came in around 8pm on a wednesday night, and the place was busy, but not overly crowded.  There wasn't a seat outside on the patio (bummer), but we were able to sit right away in the dining room.  The food was all fantastic.  I loved that I could make any taco I could dream up, but that there was also a list of excellent pre-made combinations to choose from.  I thought the Margarita's were a touch sweet, but that's probably just personal preference!  An excellent choice for solid Taco's and Margaritas."}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen. Barrio, you're on my sh*t list for having gotten wayyyyy too big for your britches - &, in my humble opinion, the food has gone downhill as the reputation grows.   Every time I've been to Barrio in last four months, I've experienced some less-than-pleasant element, from unfriendly hostesses (every. single. time) & outwardly rude servers (another server actually came up & apologized for our server's rudeness!) to looooong waits both to be seated & to grab pickup. Once, after paying for pickup, we still waited 30 minutes for two tacos - & when we followed up with the bartender, we were told, \"They'll be out when they're ready.\" Another time, I waited for 15 minutes as they dealt with a malfunctioning cash register. Maybe just give me my one $4 taco on the house instead of keeping me waiting indefinitely (with no apology)? If you're waiting to be seated, you may also want to know that Barrio has ceased to provide estimated wait times, instead only providing the number of parties waiting ahead of you - which is, of course, useless. Will you be waiting five minutes or 65? Who knows?!  And the tacos have just gotten SO WET. Like, pour-out-your-taco-before-you-eat-it wet. I've never eaten a taco here that didn't need a fork & a pile of napkins. In other words: not worth all the hassle they've become. I do like their food, but it's not good enough to put up with the restaurant's collective ego."}
{"text":"Food is great. Lots of choices and the create your own idea is good. Steak, chicken, shrimp, bacon, chorizo, pork. All delicious. Also like their Shell options. Pretty neat and good. Not really food porn material, but tasty!  Happy Hour Area was too crowded so paying full price. Could have saved a few bucks ($1 per taco) had I wanted to wait 25 mins. I was hungry so I missed out. Bummer.    Waiter was good with drink refills (water and soda). Wish it was half price margaritas though like the people 10 feet away were getting."}
{"text":"Overall great experience. Service was quick. Margaritas, guacamole and tacos were great. Lots of choices. Decor was cool and atmosphere was sweet."}
{"text":"A favorite every time we visit CLE!! The house made chorizo is my favorite protein for the tacos and the green goddess shell is a must try as well. While the combinations of tacos is endless the only thing i'd advise going is it to know that the menu is pretty much solely tacos. It is super casual but very good!!! Think of it almost like a food truck based in a restaurant with a full bar."}
{"text":"Solid four. Yes. Four.  Go for coca-cola marinated steak, slaw and pineapple mini bowl.   If I lived here I'd hit this place up once a quarter.   Skip the margs. Mid-grade, too sweet mix. Such a shame. If they had good margs, the place would be terrific."}
{"text":"Everything is freaking delicious here. I frequent all the Barrios: Tremont, Lakewood, downtown East 4th and even at Progressive field. Love to create my own tacos and never had a bad one wth all the delicious options. The quest is the best I've ever had. House margaritas are also the best and not too sweet. I love they have added jalapeno as a marg flavor. Patios are dog friendly and just an overall cool atmosphere. We frequent Barrio more times a month than I would like to admit lol. Get the nachos with chorizo if ever at Progressive field!"}
{"text":"Tacos were good, regret getting various topping that didn't mix well. Cilantro weren't my favorite. Place has nice art work, very crowded."}
{"text":"Everything kind of tastes the same -   At first I thought it was how I was picking ingredients - so I tried some of their \"special\" tacos.  They all taste the same.  I am not sure how they get chicken to taste like braised beef, but the other than the texture - the flavors are very similar.  The guac is excellent, and the chips are good.  Margaritas  are a-OK - never had a bad one here.   Service is excellent, the wait staff is quick and attentive, which is nice if you just want to stop in for some quick grub.  Despite all this I continue to go here - I like the concept, and the food is good enough."}
{"text":"Was really packed walked in with a party of 8 to see if there was any openings . The hostess was rude . First she seemed bothered by us then said oh it's 45 min wait . Which is fine but her tone was like please leave it's Sunday and it's early close night voice . Then as I turned to ask the others if they wanted to wait she said how about you talk about it outside . Rude !!!! I said ok not problem . Then her next comment was if you decide not to stay that's ok . Was my first time in this place . Everyone raved about it and it will also be my last"}
{"text":"This place really does it right. Great \"create your own\" taco order sheets and even better already created ones on the menu. Drinks are unique but palatable to many different types of drinkers, draft craft beer is diverse and selection is very legitimate. Atmosphere feels very young and alive- good music- great place to grab a bite and some drinks after work! Will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! It is the bomb! They have the best happy hour that has $3 margaritas and $3 tacos. The green goddess taco is to die for. It's only $1 extra and it has a soft taco with guac and cheese sauce and then a hard shell taco in it. I'm so glad I decided to try it! Their house margaritas are really good but they also have a wide variety of other flavors.  Since this place is so good, it is very popular and frequently busy. You can only get the happy hour deals if you sit at the bar or the tables in the bar room. It's worth the wait for a spot to open up if you get there and it's full. The bartender we had was okay, wasn't the friendliest fella but I didn't mind because the food and drinks did not disappoint. I was able to get a buzz and dinner for $10 - you can't beat it! I can't wait to check out the Lakewood location next."}
{"text":"Really disappointed after seeing the rave reviews. The tacos were too fusion for me.. Too much sauce, overwhelming the fresh, original flavors of the ingredients included. I can see people really liking sauce enjoying these tacos, but this really didn't do it for my palette. I prefer mixtures of distinctive flavors, which was really lacking. The mix of different taco shells helps to balance the saucy and prevent soggy shells.  The banh mi taco was really awful. I couldn't stand the flavor nor texture, which was really missing the point of what a banh mi should taste like. Sauces also were not at all spicy despite their rating of 4 peppers for some of the dishes. As first timers, we had no idea which tacos were what, so we had to guess. We still don't know.   Saving grace was their chips and salsa. Guac was wayy salty.   Service was subpar and low key. As first timers, it took us a moment to realize that we ordered off of the sheets at the table. Our server was slow to come back and my boyfriend was often looking for him to try and order another drink.   Sadly, was looking for something that emphasized different flavors and more spice without the heavy reliance on sauces. Maybe I'll just come in to eat the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"First timer and really enjoyed the neighborhood, trendy atmosphere, courteous and prompt service, and the tacos (okay, my taco bowels made to order) were done perfectly. Consider stopping in."}
{"text":"I have to downgrade my review. Last time I was at Barrio, I would have given the place 2.5 stars. This time? Definitely a solid 2.   My fiance and I stopped in for a quick lunch on Saturday. He'd never been there so we were pretty excited to try it out together. An improvement from my last visit years ago was service. Our server was very attentive and checked on us quite a bit...but the restaurant was pretty empty.  We sat on the patio to enjoy the nice weather...but only heard the sound of a jackhammer on the patio next door. Oh, well. We ordered some drinks to try and make the ambiance better. My skinny margarita was...awful? I drink them just about everywhere I go, but it just wasn't good. It was extremely sour. My fiance ordered a regular margarita and it was pretty sub par, too. What was great was the traditional guacamole we ordered. It was pretty flavorful and the portion was huge.  I ordered a hungry hippie taco - a suggested vegan taco on the menu - and then created my own tofu taco. Neither one was very good. I can take credit for my own creation being a FAIL, but a taco on the menu? Nope. Literally every component was cold. The same was the case for my fiance's meaty tacos. Who wants cold tacos? Especially when they're meant to be warm.  Overall, this was a very unremarkable meal. I can honestly say that I'm in no rush to go back to Barrio, and probably won't go back again unless nothing else is open, someone else is paying, or I've lost a bet and need to eat cold tacos as my punishment."}
{"text":"We have gone here a few times, always with our infant daughter. We took some out of town friends once on a Saturday afternoon and some Parma friends on a Friday night. Both times the food and drinks were great and the service was good. The atmosphere feels very 'bar' to me, but I don't mind. The people are friendly, the bathrooms are clean and the food is really good! As with any Lakewood restaurant, trying to get in to eat on a Saturday night is a joke, but other than that, we like it there. The only bad part is if you have to wait you are likely going to be crammed in the entrance near the hostess or standing outside. I only wish it was a little bigger (laid out better?) to have a small place to wait. Seriously check it out though if you have a hankerin' for some tacos, chips, salsa, the works! Since it's Build Your Own I feel like it's a fancier Chipotle! ;)"}
{"text":"My favorite place! Always my very first stop when I come to Cleveland. All the food is fresh, exciting and delicious. There is always something new to try but the old favorites remain. I can not believe how affordable it is. The concept is great, the staff is great, the price is great, the food is great!"}
{"text":"I CRAVE barrio. Mexican food is my favorite, and barrio is my all time favorite restaurant.   The ordering style is the bomb. The menu is set up where you bubble in your choice of shell (or lack there of), protein, toppings, and condiments. Then you just had it off to your server. No explaining \"*86 this,\" \"add this,\" and no chance of your order getting screwed up. I wish ALL restaurants did this.   The food is phenomenal. I don't really know any words to describe it, but again, I literally crave it. Everything on their menu is pretty simple, so you can mix a lot of different things without getting overwhelmed by too many flavors. Their table salsa that come with the complementary chips is really awesome as well. Their chipotle creama sauce is on point.   I haven't delved too much into their drink menu, but every time I go there I get their el diablo margarita. It's some bright lime green concoction and I have no idea what's in it or what flavors I'm tasting but it's the best mixed drink I've ever had.   The patio is really cozy, and they have a little fire pit that's very nice if you're lucky enough to score the one seat in front of it. The inside is a little cramped and the decor is a little much for me, hipster in vibe but expected from Tremont. Also typical of Tremont, it tends to get very crowded which is something I hate so I only go there for early brunches on the weekend. That's just a personal preference.   Never had bad service there, the staff is pretty friendly and upbeat and accommodating if you need something. Our wait times are always extremely minimal but again we go right at opening.   The prices are great for the most part. 2 tacos fill me up and cost only a measly $7 for that. I ALWAYS order 4 and take two to go for dinner. The drink prices are meh but on point for the location.   My only gripes: the charge for a side of rice or beans is pretty ridiculous. You get a condiment cup size of either for $1 which is really lame given how cheap both items are to prepare. The last time I had the beans they were too salty for me to even stomach. I also found my last visit that the shredded beef was over salted too, but we visited again today and the beef was perfect.  Oh, also, my husband who equally loves barrio tried something off the brunch menu (don't know what it was called, I think it was just a taco with egg and bacon) and said I wasn't missing anything. I want to try their french toast one of these days because it sounds amazing but I'm rarely in the mood for french toast when I go to a taco joint"}
{"text":"Another 5 Star Barrio Location! Consistent ambiance with the other Barrio locations, fantastic & efficient service, and quality ingredients.   The star for me here is the build-your-own-taco. You can't go wrong (and if you do, you only have yourself to blame!). Everything is custom made so you know it's freshly made and can be specified to exactly what you want. Options are endless--double shells and bacon are my standouts.   Margarita flavors are plentiful and excellent on the rocks. Don't miss out on the specials which change seasonally.  Monthly there are themed queso, guac, tacos and nachos that get pretty wild (don't miss the thanksgiving dinner Taco come November!).   The real question is...when are you opening a location in Cincinnati?!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! I have to stop every time I am in Cleveland.  They have unique flavors and combinations like green bean casserole queso and buffalo chicken queso. All their guacamole is delicious too. Their taco menu is diverse but my favorite feature is the make your own taco--there are so many ways to make a great taco, love that you can get a hard and soft taco shell on one item.  Drink menu is diverse and have a lot of creative concoctions. The margaritas are great and the pitchers area  good deal. There is a beautiful outdoor patio but be prepared to wait--every time I have been the place has been full."}
{"text":"I have to stop at Barrio every time I come to Cleveland. Amazing variety of quesos, salsa, margaritas, and tacos. The service is good and attentive and location was perfect.  Tacos are custom and they always have creative specials. Tried the Thanksgiving Dinner taco (turkey, dressing, gravy, etc) in a taco...mind blowing.   Their happy hour is fantastic. $4 flavored margaritas (although why get one when you can get a whole pitcher...).   Get there early because they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"Fabulous food! I really wasn't expecting much because there is so much hype about this place, and sometimes restaurants are more famous for their name than their food, but Barrio Tremont was honestly extremely delicious. Every taco off the chef's menu was amazing, and my build-your-own taco was superb. It sucks that there isn't much standing room to wait inside, and the bar is small, but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I was impressed. I loved the variety of the tacos and toppings. It was awesome that we got complementary chips and salsa, too! I was disappointed that there was only one size of cheese dip and that it costs $6! I ordered a house margarita and that tasted great! I loved the decor of the place. There were two of us dining and we had to get a pager because there was a wait after 8pm on a Wednesday night! The hostess was very friendly and nice. Our server wasn't very personable or friendly, but it was very busy so... yeah. I would definitely come back here again!!"}
{"text":"Barrio is a solid 4 in my opinion.   Margaritas : excellent. I really enjoyed mine from here. They're a little sweet and not terribly strong, but tequila and I are just starting to regain our friendship after a 3 year hiatus, so that was ideal for me.   Food: for some reason I just can't seem to make a set of tacos that I love. Usually one is okay and the other is ehhh. I've taken to buying their creations thinking that maybe I'm just incapable, but I have yet to be wowed. If we were going solely on food I would probably only give barrio a 3.   Why the extra star? It's a fun local staple throughout the Cleveland area. Prices are reasonable and I love the options you get in selecting your toppings. If you haven't been here it's worth the trip.   Insider tip: this location is always crowded. Show up early and dress warm if it's cold out because there's not a lot of space to wait in. Also just buy a side of guac unless you're sharing with a large group- much cheaper. Also. The ghost chili pepper sauce is HOT. As a hot sauce aficionado I may or may not have cried for 5-6 minutes."}
{"text":"First of all it's a nice atmosphere and much closer to my house than the others so I was happy that they opened up in CH. I decided to take my father there for his birthday. Second, the service was terrible, my waitress came over maybe 4 times the whole meal. We started off with queso which came out pretty quickly and was good. By the time we got the second basket of chips, the queso had already cooled down because they were out of baskets for grad parties. I am not so sure our inattentive waitress would have brought us any regardless. She was too busy with the other tables. The tacos took almost an hour to come out and they were pretty good. My girlfriend got the bacon one and it had like one small strip of bacon on it and no cheese at all(which she circled) When the girl finally brought over the cheese, that taco was also no longer warm. Now let's get to the biggest farce. The \"protein\" upcharge. This place charges a dollar for beans or rice if you want them on your taco. Looking at the menu, you'd only think that meat was the extra charge so it was an awfully big surprise when my party racked up $15 extra for a spoonful of rice or beans. Every other place, this is a free addition. Overall, very disappointing visit to a place that is supposed to be a top tier place in Cleveland. Looking around at other reviews, it doesn't even look like their support team even addresses the issues with apologies and taking in feedback."}
{"text":"I'm writing this as a companion piece to my Tremont Barrio review.  I just tried out this location yesterday. I love the decor as much as Tremont but the space is so big and noisy. We waited for a table and stood awkwardly around trying to stay out of the servers' way.  The bar was packed but we were able to get drinks. Once we were seated, our server was slow to check on us and we had to track her down for a second drink. The food was as good as the Tremont Barrio and I still highly recommend the Stoner upgrade and Ghost Pepper sauce.  I hope the best for this location but I think I will stick to the Tremont one."}
{"text":"Since Barrio opened, I've been an avid fan. I don't get out often but when I do its usually to the same few favorites. Barrio is close to the top of my list for drinks and a quick, cheap meal. I usually sit at the bar and love the ambiance. The bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. I've rarely had to wait long for my meal and the tacos are always awesome! I highly recommend the Stoner upgrade and the Ghost Pepper hot sauce. YUM!"}
{"text":"BEANS AND RICE  I was really looking forward to a good Taco with my daughter on Fathers Day. But things just didn't go as expected.   We wanted to sit inside since it was about 90 degrees outside. But since they left the doors open to the patio it left us sweating and miserable. But I wasn't going to let a little heat ruin my day so we pushed on. Cold Coronas and lemonade came next.   We then picked up the pads where you write down your order for tacos. Strangely there was no prices next to anything. But hey, they are tacos, can't be that bad. I ordered corn tortillas but didn't realize that the menu said \"crunchy only\". Which I do NOT like. So that was the first BIG disappointment that I discovered once our food arrived. I casually checked that I wanted beans and rice on my tacos too which are a staple for Mexican food.   We ordered cheese dip and guac for our tortilla chips. Those were delicious.  Everything went ok with  our meal except me not liking the main course.  The restaurant was HOT and crowded and they had tables so close to each other that it was kind of weird. #greedymuch?  I then received our bill for six tacos and two drinks. $50.07!!!!!!  I did a double take. Then I realized that they charged me $12 for the beans and rice. Now we aren't talking like 2 side orders, it was just adding a spoonful of each on our tacos. When we go to Si Senor, they gIve you your tacos (yes they have soft corn tortillas) and them you go to the food bar and put as much beans and rice on as you want.,,for FREE.   I do NOT recommend Barrio."}
{"text":"Make your own taco, hmm...  They have a number of different meat options - chorizo, beef, pulled pork, fish, chicken, tofu.  Having eaten here twice I've tried the first four.  Of the meats I tried, the pulled pork was definitely the best.  It was tasty, cooked well and had a great texture.  The chorizo was very spicy but tasted pretty good as well.  And the beef was decent as well, though it didn't really stand out either way.  Now the fish... well, honestly, I don't know what that was.  We were given little cubes of what did not really resemble or taste like fish to me.  You can add a number of different toppings and a couple of unique sauces.  I liked both their cilantro/garlic aioli and cilantro/pesto sauces.  Their flavored margaritas are pretty good too (I tried the mango).  Though I would say either the alcohol flavor is masked very well or there is not much of it.  The service was very slow.  We ordered maybe ten minutes after our friends but got our food half an hour later."}
{"text":"Barrio is nothing like the Mexican places that you would be able to find south of the Mason-Dixon line.  That being said, I do like the concept of make-your-own taco, and the tacos taste as you expect them to.  The margaritas are pretty good too - you cannot really taste the alcohol, which is a plus or a minus depending on how you look at it. Their service is quite slow though - I remember many a time that we would be sitting around for half an hour with our chips and margaritas wondering what had happened."}
{"text":"Ah. Hmmmm. Well.   The positives: the place is stunning! Great art on the walls--very Dia de los Muertos--and cool lighting that would be nice on a date. The margaritas are nice, and the El Chupacabra has some serious heat in it. $3 a taco is a decent deal, as well.   The less-than-positives: pretty much everything else. The tacos were... taco-ish. The chorizo lacked the greasy crimson of actual chorizo meat. The sauces all seemed a bit funny and off, too sweet or too creamy for a good taco. Between four tacos, I think my table only finished one of them. And do not--do not!--order the pickled veg. It tasted like the fermenting rinds of a vegetable bin. Ugh.   The staff were pretty crazy the night we visited, so I'll give them a pass on the less-than-stellar service, but the food was really lack-luster, if not just disappointing. Maybe I'll try them again. Maybe."}
{"text":"the concept of this place is great. but that is about it.  you go in and there is a piece of paper with everything on it. you mark it all up and add your name to the top. your waitress takes it away and brings back your food. itallows you to customize everything from meat, tortilla, lettuce, sauce, EVERYTHING!  however....  1) service is forgettable- waitress was.... not helpful at all. slow inattentive and not friendly. it almost seemed like we were bothering her by being there 2) food was inaccurate- my order is written down on a piece of paper and given back to me and was still completed incorrectly.  3) margaritas were eh.- the waitress didn't ask us if we wanted blended or salt on the rim. she just assumed and walked away. they aren't as good as momocho   service was slow. we waited for quite awhile for the waitress to just take away our slips of paper. she didn't even have to take our order and still took forever! i felt like that was silly   the food didn't taste that great either. coming from an area which has a plethora of Hispanic food, these are subpar. tacos need some work! simple ingredients!!  also the \"specialty\"  tacos were TINY TINY TINY!! for $4 you got a tiny taco. standing next to your $3 build your own taco that is 3x the size that ridiculous. Specialty taco should be something more interesting. we felt ripped off with the specialty taco  lots of room for improvement but has a lot of potential!  P.S. Love the ghost chili!!! although it should be MORE SPICY!"}
{"text":"For tacos and salsa this is our place!  W/ all the burger joints doing create your own, this is better!  My wife absolutely loves this place, 2nd time here with our children, and still pretty hospitable, considering its bar like atmosphere!  First time we ate at barrio was out of there travel truck at a \"jimmy buffet concert\" just as good!  A must if your in the treamont area!  Oh but just be aware they use a lot o fresh ingredients, so If you order to much, and sit for awhile you will start to notice there bug problem, and if ya can't parallel park you better learn how!"}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place: opening at 1PM on a Saturday. Everything else was superb. The decor is fun to look at - I felt like I was finding something I hadn't seen before every time I looked around. I had the blood orange margarita and a very difficult time picking out my tacos. I settled on two flour soft shell, one with chorizo the other with the pulled pork and various toppings. Both were very tasty. Will be returning here for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it is always a good time. Happy hour prices are decent: half off margaritas, dollar off drafts/tacos/whiskey.  Free chips and salsa is a plus-the salsa is very smoky in flavor and is already making my mouth water just thinking about it.    The tacos are delicious! Completely customizable, order how you want it (but there are some suggested ones as well!)  The fancy taco shells are good as well..I've gotten them when I go there, but they can be hit or miss. The first few times I had the specialty taco shells, they were amazing, with lots of guac and cheese, providing a lot of flavor and substance.  The most recent time I went it wasn't as good..it was very bland, without much filling between the soft and hard shell..a disappointment.  The actual taco filling is very good though and made up for some of that.  One last note, the ghost pepper is good, but not very spicy..but I'm one who can handle a lot of spiciness."}
{"text":"This place is way larger than it looks! Even though it was very crowded, we ordered drinks at the bar and only had to wait around 40 minutes or so. The waiter was average; he was kind of absent-minded and forgot a few things, but all the other people that dropped off chips were really helpful and friendly. The bartender was fast and efficient, and the draft list is extensive.   I went with the chef recommendations and tried the Taco with a soft shell AND hard shell. It was fantastic! I was impressed by the texture and all the different flavors combining into this tasty taco. It wasn't spicy either, which is perfect for me because I can't handle spice at all. Love this new location! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to barrio. But lately when I've been coming here it's been a hit or miss with the quality of the food. I've had my food cold a few times. I understand this location is normal packed, but I hope they don't rush making the orders. Quality over Quantity. Another thing is it's always so loud in here, so I'm constantly yelling to the person I'm eating with because we can't hear each other. Over all the vibe of the place is really nice, and the margs are killer!"}
{"text":"A fun restaurant in Lakewood, always crowded and noisy (at least on weekends), and sometimes a bit of a wait to get a table. It has a \"Dias de Los muertos\" themed decor, including a skeleton riding a bicycle! Food is \"design your own taco\", with many choices of fillings-- go wild. Low starch options galore.-- get the bowl instead of a taco shell. Tables inside and (if the weather is nice) out on the sidewalk. Extensive beer list! Great food, fantastic decor, but noisy."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, and service.  People need to be reasonable.  The place is always busy, plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Fun, fun place!  It's just the perfect food-with-drinks kind of place.  For $3 each, you make your own tacos. (Ordering off of a check list, choosing your own shell, protein, toppings, etc).  Totally vegan-friendly too.  I ordered two corn/hard shells, one with spicy tofu and the other with black beans, both with a jicama slaw and salsas.  You can also order a small side of rice which comes in the perfect-sized four ounce container to compliment the tacos. So $7 got me two tacos and rice which was more than enough for me.  The food was surprisingly good.  Everything tastes fresh."}
{"text":"It was Saturday a little after noon, I sat at the bar looking to have lunch. I have always enjoyed Barrio and looked forward to its opening on the east side. I ordered a beer and chips and salsa while I filled out my order for 3 tacos. As I handed my filled out order sheet the bartender, half was thru my $5 beer, he asked for my credit card. I asked if he was kidding as I was there to eat lunch and I preferred to pay once I was done. He said it was the mangers policy. The manager better learn how it's customers deserve to be treated. I was appalled. Funny thing is, the bartender agreed."}
{"text":"Tacos are fantastic. All styles are delicious, and the \"stoner shell\" is a must have. Here is a solid happy hour from 4-7, but you MUST be sitting at the bar to get happy hour prices. Make sure you try multiple types!"}
{"text":"I love the make your own tacos and Barrio has the best chips and Salsa in town.  Beer selection is excellent.  I thought 3 tacos would hold me over.  2 fills me up.  I mix it up on every visit.  The queso cheese is also very good!"}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos, so so margaritas and amazing salsa/queso. The tacos are up to you-- just don't over build them or you won't be able to taste anything! But the homemade toppings are great and fresh. Just stay away from the margaritas-- the sour mix is sickeningly sweet and you can't taste any tequila. Beer options are there to save the day."}
{"text":"I've tried Barrio twice. While in Cleveland Heights, I thought I would give it another chance, but I was disappointed once again. First of all, the tacos came out cold. We sent them back and received hot tacos, but they were just bland. The shrimp is bland and the cheeses are put on top ice cold. The tofu is also quite bland, same with the grilled mushrooms. Just bland overall! Also, the soft tortillas are not warmed up, which is a pretty major offense when it comes to making tacos (they would nail them for it on Chopped lol!). I think this really is more of a place to go for drinks and some chips and queso rather than for an actual meal. The salsa and margarita are quite good, and the outdoor seating is cute. The tacos just do not deliver. Cool concept- just not executed that well."}
{"text":"Barrio! Barrio! Barrio!  I really wanted to give you a really good rating but the food did not meet our expectations.  We waited an hour to be seated on a Tuesday night.  The guacamole was probably the worst I've ever had.  The tacos were cold.  Very cold!  You can tell that this place chops up the vegetables early in the day, keeps them cold, and then throws them in a tortilla or taco shell.  This is not what I would ever call Mexican food. Sorry!  The Cranberry margarita was good but you could not taste the tequila.  This place is also very noisy, it's actually crazy noisy.  My children actually witnessed several people who were highly intoxicated which made them feel extremely uncomfortable.  What did I enjoy?  I liked the decor.  The manager and our server were amazing!  Will I be going back? Absolutely not."}
{"text":"My 9yo loves Barrio and I've always been sort of lukewarm, until this last visit. We popped in on Black Friday and to my absolute delight found that their monthly special is a Turkey Taco! Turkey, stuffing, sweet potato puree, cranberry drizzle topped with brussels sprouts -- perfect!! What stops me from giving 5 stars is that the service in the bar was so-so, and our tacos were cold. But we'll go back and give them our business, because the 9yo doesn't care about bar service and cold tacos  :-)"}
{"text":"Fresh food and speedy service usually. Good drinks, too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food fast service. Would've given 5 stars. But the drinks were really small for what they charge."}
{"text":"I literally dream of tacos and I live for a good old taco Tuesday. Barrio does it best. Trust me. I could go here every day. The fact it's always quite busy and is what keeps me from doing that, I think. However it's worth the wait each and every time. We make our own tacos every time, and it took me awhile to find the perfect mix of my favorite ingredients but now that I figured it out, I can't stop and won't stop.   The best queso of my life is here as well. Many times I've contemplated using a straw in the bowl but I've refrained. Their chips are always so fresh. Service can be hit or miss but I have never really cared because tacos. Once I ordered a drink from here that I didn't love and they promptly took it away from me and let me re order, free of charge, the way it should be. I just love Barrio so much and it's such a cleveland staple."}
{"text":"Cool Place, Cool Concept, Good Food, Good Drinks!  After a few more visits, the experience has become \"overrated\" (sadly).  The drinks are eh and the tacos are basic build your own...not \"authentic\" but with good service and a good group, you'll enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"I'm Not really familiar with the Historic Tremont area, but decided to check out Barrio.  I Was very impressed by the superior service from the second we walked in the door. My friends and I Wanted a seat outside, but the hostess politely offered to take down our name. We grabbed a drink at the bar where we got delicious margaritas and it wasn't long before the hostess prepared a table for us. Our server, was great. The patio was very busy, but she still had time to talk to us and explain the menu to us. It wasn't long before our tacos came out, which were absolutely delicious.  Everyone at Barrio was so kind and welcoming, from the hostess smiling at everyone even while juggling clearing tables to seat people right away, to the adorable bartenders constantly running back and forth from tables back to the bar and finally our Server bringing us our delicious food.  I will definitely Recommend Barrio to friends, and try to make it back up to Cleveland for another great night!"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday night about 8.  The restaurant was busy. The hostess told me it would be about 30 minutes until a table was available. I opted for the bar. It was crowded but I found a seat.  At the bar I waited about ten minutes for a bartender to come over. No luck. I waived to one and got her attention. She took my order.  They have a great choice of tacos, including build your own, and an extensive beer selection. The build your own Taco menu has a number of vegetarian and vegan options. That's what I chose. The tacos were fantastic.  I also got a side order of rice. It was small and arrived without a fork.   I would have given this place 5 stars but for the service. Everyone was friendly and they were well staffed. I just can't figure out why the only time a bartender came over was when I flagged one down."}
{"text":"Barrio is OK - after eating here many times, that is my final opinion. The new Cleveland Heights location is really festive, but the tacos tend to be soggy or lukewarm or both. I like the guac, queso and drinks, so I recommend it for happy hour, but i would go elsewhere for a full meal."}
{"text":"Providing swift, plucky service on a Saturday night (this reviewer and his companion were seated in what felt like seconds!), tremendous customizable tacos, and a much richer, spicier salsa than the downtown location (beware Gateway Barrio's oddly watery blend), Tremont Barrio is worth a look for both taco dilettantes and connoisseurs alike. Akin to the bulk of Tremont restaurants, this location is very much the sort of spot which feels like dining in someone's turn of the century living room, complete with some sharp angled corners and low ceilings and steps where you wouldn't expect them. There is an ample patio, however, for al fresco munching--complete with a charming fireplace. The patio is prime real estate in the summer, however, so expect a wait if you'd like to be seated there. The drinks are spectacular and reasonably priced--take a look at the slight, but excellent mescal selection for the perfect accompaniment to the never-ending salsa and crispy, (if perhaps overly) salty tortilla chips. The only real beef one might conceivably have with Barrio is that their menu contains none of the 'traditional' Mexican staples like quesadillas, gorditas, et al. A small price to pay, however, for some of the best tacos in the city. Vegetarians would do well to load theirs up with black beans, rice, and the cilantro+onions combo. The rather sweet/spicy tofu, while a tad on the chewy side, is also a favorite of yours truly. Overall, Barrio turns incredible business for a reason. It is Cleveland's flagship taco bar. You won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. The only time it is open though during the week is on Fridays. Kind of annoying when there are so many businesses downtown. So when it's Friday this place is packed!! I suggest going early so you get a seat because if not, plan on waiting.  I got beef tacos. Packed full of flavor! I had two tacos and was full. They may look small but with everything you can put on them your full. Mine had typical lettuce tomato and I had some salsa added. The salsa was so good. The beef oh my gosh... was so delish. Not hard to chew, nice and juicy.  The waitress was great! There were 8 of us and she kept up on all of us! Didn't get cards or bills mixed up. She had a smile on her face the whole time. She had quite a few tables. If it was me, I woulda been screaming in the back.  The place was clean, tables weren't sticky and chairs were clean as well.  Again, great place, but needs to be open for lunch more than 1 day a week! Especially downtown!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burritos I've ever had.   Enough said   You can create your own burritos they have cards you fill out and you can put whatever you want on them and order the whatever quantity you wish.  They are large so be carful."}
{"text":"My first experience at Barrio during happy hour and it was fun.  I loved the build your own taco form.  It's like a checklist of the options you want your build to order taco. You fill it out and hand it to your server.  Lots of options for protein, cheese and toppings.  I chose the monthly special of Surf n Turf (I was there before New Years as this was their special at the time) and a braised beef taco with Barrio secret sauce.  All was delicious.  I can't wait to go back again.  Happy hour is the way to go for a good deal on tacos and drinks."}
{"text":"The original Barrio location is in the trendy Tremont neighborhood, which makes it a perfect place for a weekend dinner. That being said, it is extremely popular, especially among the hipster crowd, and there is usually a long wait for tables. Before visiting, I had heard great things about their tacos, and after having eaten here a couple of times, I can say Barrio lives up to the hype.   On my last visit, I was with a large group of 8, and we arrived around 9:30ish. As expected, there was a long wait, so we ponied up in the few spots at the bar. My brother ordered a Paloma, and he normally knows what's up, so I followed his lead. I love margaritas, but the Paloma is way better than a margarita. It is a tequila/grapefruit juice drink, and it is so refreshing and delicious! I ended up drinking more than one throughout our meal. Enough seats finally opened up at the bar, so we ended up just eating there and not waiting for a table. We were starving, so we started off with the queso and chorizo, and it was amazing! The whole concept is build your own tacos ($3 each), so each person grabs a sheet and starts marking with they want. You choose your tortilla, protein, cheese, toppings, salsa, and sauces. I always feel like the pre-generated taco selections turn out better then the ones I've built myself. The standout for me was the El Jefe! The Green Goddess was my favorite shell with soft flour and hard corn tortillas plus queso and guacamole.   You can't go wrong with really anything that order at Barrio, so get your butt in there and try the Paloma too!"}
{"text":"Simple Tacos, $3 per taco need 2 of them to fill me up, add a million toppings and slather some good sauce on there. Drink selection was more than adequate."}
{"text":"see all other 5stars, nothing not to love about this authentic and tasty build your own tacos with many unique and different flavors ranging from the tortillas to the salsas ... Nothing bland here"}
{"text":"Is it really summer in CLE until you go to Barrio? No, it isn't. There isn't really anything for me to say that hasn't been said already. I highly recommend getting your order in a bowl if your watching your carb intake. It's a dollar more but still a steal and I'm convinced you get more food anyways.   Bring your dates here!! I can't even imagine having a bad date here."}
{"text":"Before I came to Barrio, I first went to a build-your-own Mexican place in Columbus, Ohio. The following week I went here. While both places are very similar, Barrio stole my heart. Everything about it was just a smidge better than what I experienced in Columbus at Condado. Let me list the ways:  1) Despite being super popular, it was surprisingly easy to find seating on a Thursday night.  2) The taco in general stays together really well/all the filling doesn't poop out the other end immediately.  3) The drinks. Wowza. And such a steal if you sit at the bar! 4) Super casual in regards to clothing. No need to dress to impress and then spill salsa on your pretty outfit. 5) Parking, while mostly street, is easy. You won't have to pay or walk far to get to this Barrio location!"}
{"text":"Barrio is a wanna-be West Coast taco joint with horrible service.   The staff here is incredibly rude. I get it, they're hipsters, but they still work in the service industry and shouldn't treat customers like an inconvenience. The staff was so rude and then when we asked to close out our tab the bartender told us to ask someone else. Unbelievable.  As for the food, the food is good, but not great. Barrio's tacos are basically just wanna-be West Coast tacos. Nothing special.   Finally, Barrio is clearly understaffed. We came in for dinner and drinks before a concert and we're told that it was going to be a 2-hour wait. Meanwhile, we saw tables sitting empty for 20+ minutes without being cleaned. Clearly, the wait would be a lot shorter if the staff turned the tables a bit faster.   This place is not worth the wait. I recommend that you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am a slave to this restaurant.  No, seriously. I just moved to CLE 6 months ago, and this is the restaurant I've visited most (excluding Chipotle). Here, dig this:  Bro: \"Let's grab something in Tremont.\" Me: \"Sure what?\" Bro: \"Hmmm... Let me look on Yelp.\" ... Bro: \"Barrios?\" Me: \"YES.\"  Please bear in mind my use of \"Bro\" is inclusive of the female sex as well.  Aside from being ridiculously cheap, the tacos are amazing. Californians should go in understanding these tacos are far from authentic, but are supremely delicious. I usually order 2, since the tacos run large.  Green Goddess is my personal favorite shell; any of the proteins, salsas, etc., you can't go wrong. If you don't like your taco messy (it will be anyways), you can write to have your sauces served on the side on the order form.  The margaritas are served on the rocks, and come highly recommended.  Be warned, it gets SUPER crowded, regardless what day of the week it is. Prepare to stand in line for 30 or so minutes.  Note: The chips that come free are excellent. If you want some of the best guac in town, get a side of guac dip. The cheese dip is also great."}
{"text":"04/16 Taco Of The Month Update: Chicken and Waffle Taco made with strips of Chicken breast fried in a waffle batter with spicy collard greens; topped with bourbon & tart cherry maple syrup; served on a flour tortilla.  Amazingly, just a few days before this was released I thought about how to bring together a chicken and waffle taco.  Most ideas pointed me toward chicken with a waffle \"shell\" but nothing appealed...then they announce this.  Even if you don't think the idea of a chicken and waffles is appealing, do yourself a favor and try this taco!  The amazing flavors don't blend but you get the unique flavors of all the ingredients separately.  Its absolutely amazing.  Start with the savory chicken then blended into a waffle, add a little spice and then end sweet with the syrup.  Its a concoction of flavors that you wouldn't think could be put in a taco...but they did it, and its amazing.    Amazing tacos, chips, salsas and guacamole! Awesome for late night and dinner... Only complaint is that it's not open for lunch!   They have quite the eclectic choice for tacos and I would recommend anyone let themselves out of their comfort zone with this one. The \"special\" tacos have never disappointed... Worth a try, especially at only a few bucks each,or just come back for happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Okay, I've been living in Los Angeles for almost ten years...so, imma admit I have expectations when it comes to tacos.  Our tacos are akin to New York's hot dogs.  This place was just, meh.  30 minute wait prior to the Cavs game (which it is a block from the arena) and not a lot of personality...from the staff or the food.  Clevelanders: no these tacos are not amazing.  They are just tacos and they still took 20-30 minutes to create."}
{"text":"Add another new hip place to visit in the revitalized Tremont area. Barrio is a mix between your neighborhood bar and trendy restaurant with a cool take on tacos, tequila and whisky. For around $4 each you can build your own own tacos with their list of meats and toppings and grab a drink for around $7 from their selections of different margaritas, whisky cocktails and other libations. The summer time is great with their huge outdoor patio, though it tends to fill up quick and could be a little wait if you want to sit outside.   The service is amazingly fast and since it was out first time, our server was helpful in explaining how everything worked from ordering on the menu, to recommending drinks, and suggesting starting us out with a huge bowl of guacamole (a meal in itself!). The food came out within minutes of our order and tasted fantastic. The portions are pretty enormous as well.   The bottom line is the food, the drinks, the ambiance, and the service make this a great place. Would highly recommend and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to go here for awhile for their happy hour and finally made it and we were not disappointed!  Our waitress was fantastic!  She had great recommendations and was very friendly.  Our margaritas were sooo good...try the blueberry! The chips and salsa were also good, nice amount of spice to the salsa.  And the tacos we came up with were delicious!  I like that you can make up your own and experiement."}
{"text":"Dinner here was an average experience. We were lucky to get in for happy hour which was packed.  Got a great seat by the windows.  Service was five star. Very friendly and efficient. Ordered a house margarita. I felt it was far too sweet and it seemed like there was no alcohol in it. I am not sure If they short pour their shots or what the deal is. The guac and warm queso to start was great.  Absolutely no complaints there. The tacos were not good. I contemplated building my own but went with two premade.  One was the special of the month and the other was one with chicken.  The special of the month was a falafel taco. Both tacos were cold. No mixture of warm"}
{"text":"Margaritas were killer, queso was the bomb, but the tacos (which got all the rave and looked amazing on paper) were soggy and bland. Wasn't impressed for the drive I made from the east side because I can make queso and margs at home that are just as good!"}
{"text":"I was incredibly hyped to hear that Barrio was opening up so close to my house! I've always had a good time eating at the location downtown, but having my own little Barrio to myself was a stretch dream that eventually became a reality.  The interior is huge and uniquely decorated, with a seemingly bigger seating selection than at the downtown location. The increased seating capacity is at the expense of a proper waiting area, though. Whenever it is busy, I find myself waiting awkwardly to the left of the already-left-of-center \"front desk\". That being said, I never have to wait too long. Usually, I take a walk around Cedar Fairmount.  Barrio is a winning food concept: tacos at the mercy of your judgement. Building your own tacos is something that is not necessarily beginner friendly, but an acquired skill over time. Even then, the monthly tacos and quesos are exotic, spontaneous, and just the right balance of weird and delicious. The portions are noticeably larger at this location, which is a nice touch. Two tacos is enough.  A highlight of the Cedar Fairmount area, and an excellent excuse to not go all the way downtown."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy this... At all! And we so wanted to love it!   We had queso blanco, pineapple salsa and classic guac. Guac was a weird texture and I'm concerned it was not house made (see distributor comment below), queso and salsa were good.   When ordering our tacos, we asked if one of the topping options \"cilantro + onions\" could be separated bc of my fiance's lack of appreciation for onions and we were told that it comes that way from their distributor. Say what? If chopping cilantro and onions is a job for your distributor, what the heck else are they (and you??) making?! Side note: I ordered the cilantro and onions on my taco and literally spit it and the rest of my taco into a napkin... That's a first for me!!! White, soggy, stringent onions Taft had been sitting for days. So bad!   My taco was an awful combination of savory and sweet toppings whose flavor profiles are not mentioned on the menu (necessary given That they're odd - e.g. Peppers and onions will come as a sweet red pepper jam.. Gross). My fiancé ordered a corn taco, which apparently means that you will be provided with a third of the fillings and be up charged if your order steak even though there are literally three pieces due to your shell choice.   Seriously disappointing!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night.. As did half of Cleveland. Was told we had a hour wait and put my name in. Then my wife and I hawked the bar for 2 seats. After about 20 minutes we were able to grab 2 seats at the bar. After about 10 minutes a bar tender finally freed up and took our taco and drink orders. My favorite thing about this place is you create your own taco almost and they always come out good.. Our only complaint is out of the 6 tacos ordered, 2 of them did not have the correct protein and it wasn't until the first bite that i realized i had chorizo instead of pulled pork, and my wife had shrimp instead of chicken. Still very good. We also had the cheese sauce which was tasty as well. Always a good meal here and for Mexican the prices are about average."}
{"text":"I want to like this place more but unfortunately, the tacos are mediocre. Queen, guac, salad, and drinks are good though. Staff is friendly and its a cool vibe. I just always have wrong with every taco I order (too salty, weird flavor, etc)"}
{"text":"The only thing wrong with Barrio is that they need to expand so we can get our delicious tacos sooner and not have to wait. Delicious food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great amounts of food for the price. Excellent varieties of salsa, especially the pineapple salsa! Personally not a fan of corn tortillas, I would advise asking for a flour tortilla instead."}
{"text":"This place has decent food when it comes hot and good, albeit pricy drinks. Unfortunately, any time Cleveland has an event, there is no happy hour. When you're meeting friends, specifically for happy hour, it's quite a disappointment."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a Monday evening!  Parking lot is behind the building and the entrance to the parking lot is next to the restaurant called Luna's.  They have patio seating which is great when you want to enjoy your meal and your Cleveland weather at the same time!  The service wasn't the fastest but what do you expect when the place is overcrowded with people.  I went in there with 6 people and they seated us with a small 4 seater table, so two of us had eat off the corner of this small table.  This wouldn't have bothered me so much if there wasn't any bigger tables available but there was on the other side of the restaurant.  The guacamole of the day was delicious and you could tell the vegetables were fresh.  We all ordered a build your own taco which was awesome because none of us wanted the same ingredients in our tacos which was convenient.  To add on to my 3 star rating, all of our tacos were served cold which did not make us happy.  Our server didn't even arrive until she saw that all of our plates were empty to ask how everything was.  If she had come earlier we would of said something but we waited almost an hour and 15 minutes to get our tacos and didn't want to wait anymore because we were starving. After we finished eating and noticed we were going to stay longer to continue drinking, they then put us in 6 seater table.    Overall this place was clean, service is ok, and if you don't mind cold tacos then you should try it. Pulled pork came out super dry that not even the salsa could help it.  Spicy marinated chicken was delicious and moist.  Steak was over cooked as well. But the salsa, guacamole, and vegetables in the tacos were fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I love Bario tacos. They gave a fantastic selection of preplanned tacos, or you can build your own. Excellent beer selection too."}
{"text":"I've had good experiences at Barrio but the last time I came here was after a Cavs game. There was a 30 minute wait which was fine with us as we just grabbed a drink nearby. However when we got our table and finally received our tacos they were COLD! One of my tacos (shrimp) was literally ice cold and the other (fish) was room temperature. I'm extremely confused about that... do they just serve all their seafood tacos cold on purpose? It was not a pleasant experience at all but I ate them because I was hungry. My friend also was given 2 fish tacos instead of 1 fish + 1 beef, but again - he ate them because he was hungry.  Yes, theoretically we could have complained about this and sent our food back to the kitchen, but unfortunately our server never asked us how our food tasted or if we needed anything else. This night was likely a fluke compared to how Barrio may normally operate, but my experience was definitely 1-star worthy."}
{"text":"We've been to Barrio twice and were super impressed with the quality of food, great margaritas, excellent service, and overall consistency. I recommend the Queso Elote - amazing!! Parking was the only thing that we questioned, but turned out to be a non-issue when we got a spot on the street right in front of the restaurant! We'll be returning as often as possible!"}
{"text":"I had never write a bad review... until now!   We had came in for a group of 15. They told us to there was a wait of  45 minutes. I understand that on a Tuesday night it was busy so sure we didn't mind waiting 45 min and the hostess or receptionist gave us a pager. Mind you these girls were probably 19-20 yrs old and they were not nice. We had looked outside in the patio and clearly there was 3 tables cleared and unused. We came back in asking them about it and said there was still a wait.   We came back 45 min later ourself bc no one paged us. They then tell us it was another 1 hr and 30 min!!! Not only did they not communicated  with each other bc we had 15 ppl!! They were so rude and didn't even try to accommodate us.  Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Cool place, amazing food, decent service. We are here after going to Cowboys v. Browns game. Made it in right before the rush and got a table. Ordered salsa verde and pineapple guacamole - guacamole was sooooo good. Had carne taco, pulled pork taco, chicken taco and steak taco all from chef's selections menu. All were absolutely to die for except the steak. It was aaaaawful mush. So out of place with everything else so delicious."}
{"text":"They've got some typical new-restaurant issues with service;  my friend and I were handled by three different waiters/waitresses upon getting in there, which was a little disconcerting.   They all did alright, but it seemed like they were a bit panicky and overwhelmed, even though the restaurant wasn't full.    The free chips and sals are definitely a plus.  The chips appeared to be house-made, and the salsa didn't taste like it was made of soup kitchen castoff veggies.  I was impressed, and I think between the two of us, we went through three bowls.    I ordered chorizo tacos and fried fish tacos.  The chorizo was as expected (good and greasy with a healthy kick), but the fish tacos were great.  The batter wasn't too thick, and it didn't feel overcooked.  Yes, everything wasn't delivered to the table piping hot, but honestly, I'll have it that way instead of \"oh god why is my palate bleeding?\" hot.    Overall, it just feels like they're trying to hit their stride and get the right staff.  I'll give this place another whack soon."}
{"text":"Some of the best guacamole I've ever had.  I have been here a few times, and I have learned that it's best to order one of their specialty tacos rather than trying to create my own. They are much better and creating something delicious!"}
{"text":"Some highs and lows at my first attempt here. Chips & salsa on the house was great. Ordered 2 of the vegetarian \"suggested\" tacos, and they came out ice cold - as if these ones get pre-made and are sitting in a fridge somewhere until ordered. Still tasted good though.   They suggest 3 tacos for a full meal, so my third was one I put together myself, and was my fave, and the only one that came out warm. Green-goddess shell (really 2 shells + queso + guac), beans, onions, lettuce, medium salsa, lime aoili and chihuaha cheese. mm so good.   Another high note for me was to watch my fiance eat one taco with the caliente sauce  and then have to take a 10 minute time-out for his face to stop burning and his eyes to stop crying.   Another low-note was the margarita. ordered the marygold, and it was sweeter than it was strong.   I'm confident I'll return and give an extra star now that I know what to order...2 of the tacos made my own way, order guac along with the salsa. and stick to the beers on draft."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the city by far. Three locations to pick from. Jalapeno margarita is awesome, can't really go wrong with any margaritas. Always packed to get a table but usually goes by quick."}
{"text":"We wanted something easy and light to eat until it was dinner a couple hours later. We had custom made tacos from barrio. Both were delicious! The only thing was a bit unclear was which stuff they'd charge you extra for? I had gotten a beef taco and had portobello mushrooms added and wasn't clear that was extra. And my husband had rice and beans  on both tacos and was charged extra 2 times. It wasn't clearly marked saying this will be an extra surcharge.   Other than that the waiter made a good recommendation on the beer. So that was a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Tremont Barrio, step up your game! I am a fan of Barrio, but the past few times I've been to this location little things kept happening, like forgetting to add the stoner shell to tacos, but keeping the extra dollar charge, bringing me the wrong beer, etc. I can overlook little mistakes...  -BUT- My friend had a birthday gathering there recently and our server was straight RUDE. Our group of six all ordered tacos, drinks, and little desserts for the table, so we had spent a good amount of money there. After finishing our tacos and picking at dessert, we asked our server for more chips and salsa, along with more ice for the bottle of water they put on the table (who doesn't want a nice cold glass of water?) He nodded and went along his way... and after asking him three more times, he explained that management is cracking down on the free chips & salsa and THEN he proceeded to take away the left over chips and salsa that were still on our table. I can accept that free chips & salsa is not necessarily endless chips & salsa.... But why ignore our requests three times before explaining that to us, and also, still not bringing a ice for water? My friend still had some guac leftover and was left chipless. No guac lover wants that goodness to be wasted, so she asked if she could have chips to finish the guac. He did bring chips ( with the long awaited glass of ice) but he added snidely, \"Here's a big basket of chips for that tiny amount of guacamole you have left.\"    Maybe it was because my friend was being treated so poorly on her birthday, but this is my first experiencing at any restaurant feeling like I needed to talk to a manager about the service. The manager was congenial, apologetic, and comped us with $10 gift card (which we gave to the birthday girl).  Normally, I like my reviews to highlight my favorite businesses, but a series of events have made me crack down on the Tremont Barrio for this one star review. While I might crave Barrio's tacos, I will sadly rethink and redirect my cravings to an establishment with friendlier service."}
{"text":"Awesome and cheap taco place that is always packed. The salsa, the guac, the queso, the stoner, the green goddess and the list goes on. There are a ton of things on the menu that really stick out and these are only a few. The tacos are always huge but that doesn't mean they lack quality. I would definitely give this place a try in the Tremont area. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"Not terrible, definitely not great. But I live in Texas so I'm probably biased because of the vast amount of amazing Mexican food available there. The salsa they place out on the tables was very tasty; I was pleased. Our tacos came out cold... like cold, cold. The tortillas weren't heated and the ingredients inside the tacos weren't even room temperature, just straight up cold. Create your own Taco is great, but can be difficult if you don't know how the different ingredients pair together. The cilantro pesto is amazing, that's one highlight of the experience. My husband, however, had some intestinal issues after eating here. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Barrio's tacos are just amazing! The fact that you get to completely customize your own tacos and they are so filling is beyond worth the price. It's a great atmosphere for adults although it is a little loud, but what can you expect, it's a bar! They have a wide variety of drinks so you are bound to find something for you! I can't wait to come back to Barrio soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here before a Tribe game a couple of weeks ago.  We were seated quite quickly even though the place was packed and had excellent service throughout.  The green goddess taco shell was amazing and will definitely be my go-to in the future.  My only negative comment are the stupid mason jars in which all the drinks are served.  It was cool about a decade ago.  Good beer and margaritas deserve to be served in proper glassware.  Mason jars are a sign that you're trying just a little too hard.  Stop it."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches in a pocket... Braided beef and vegetarian with a side order of Yucca fries was delish! A filling meal...a diverse crowd and a bunch of families with kids ... and the kids enjoyed the yucca fries"}
{"text":"Simply the best tacos anywhere. I love that you completely make your own taco meaning I don't have to special order anything. The Stoner shell is pretty much the best ever. We have tried all the meats but like the coco cola beef best as well as the chicken and the shrimp. Get creative and mix up the toppings. I found that some of the most unexpected combinations happen to be my favorites. Nachos are spectacular- keep them coming. All the salsas are delicious. Always worth the wait. Try the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Yay, I'm so excited they opened a Barrio so close to me in Cleveland Heights! This new location is a spacious and convenient option for a meal, happy hour, or a midnight snack. Keep in mind that as this location has just opened, it is pretty busy and you should expect a bit of a wait. I came pretty late on a weekday (around 11 pm-12 am) and didn't have to wait to get seated but there were still quite a lot of people here for what you'd expect so late on a weekday!  The food and service are both just as great at the location I've been to in Tremont. If you haven't been to Barrio before, just imagine a create-your-own taco concept where you pick the shell/meat/other fillings/sauces. If you have trouble deciding what might go well together, they have pre-set taco options, as well. You really can't go wrong with $3 tacos, and the complimentary chips and salsa are always a nice touch!   Overall, I'm very excited about this new location, and I'm sure I'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"I came to Barrio for the first time today and had a great experience! Even though I am from California, I hardly ever eat tacos (I can probably count the number of times I've had tacos on my fingers...), but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked Barrio! When we arrived around 6:30 pm, we were told the wait would probably be 30 to 45 minutes but I think we ended up waiting less than 20 minutes before we were seated so that was a nice surprise :)  Our server Samantha was super patient with us (particularly with my indecision about what to order haha) and helpful in giving recommendations! My friend and I ended up building our own tacos. We also ordered the Vandermill hard cider and blood orange margarita. Even though I basically just randomly checked off ingredients to go into my taco, the tacos I had turned out to be full of flavor and very satisfying. I ordered a chicken taco, as well as a portobello mushroom one. Their blood orange margarita is also delicious! It was sweet (but not too sweet), refreshing, and tangy. I didn't think 2 tacos would be that filling, but with the chips and salsa before the tacos and the generous portion of the tacos, I was quite full by the end of the meal! I appreciated that Samantha checked in with us a couple times to make sure we were enjoying the food and even offered to refill our chips for us towards the end of our meal.  Overall, I am quite satisfied with my first visit to Barrio, and I'd like to come back in the future for happy hour! Happy hour specials include half off margaritas, $1 off drafts, and $1 off tacos, but FYI this is only if you sit in the bar area. Happy hour or not, the delicious food and great service make Barrio definitely a place worth checking out. As someone who would hardly be considered a taco enthusiast, I was impressed and I'd definitely love to come back again!"}
{"text":"First time being at this location! Food was amazing, our server amber was awesome as well! She was prompt and gave amazing service! The bartenders didn't seem too happy though. They didn't smile or seem interested in helping anyone and looked upset and angry. Waiting for my drink at the bar I over heard multiple people talk about how mean the bartenders were and they were rolling their eyes. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"I've been there several times now, twice because we couldn't get into Momocho. This place does not  disappoint on food or drinks. I have had a soggy taco, but it was because I ordered it pretty overloaded. Keep it normal sized and it won't be a mess. Also try the special taco!"}
{"text":"The margs are amazing, the salsa for the chips is so so, and the queso app is one of my favorites. But what I love about this place is how you can custom make your tacos, and it's cheap! You can put as many things as you want.... It might take you some time to find your go to, but once you do you'll wish you could do this at every taco joint. Get the white widow, it's an extra $1 but so worth it.  In addition to the 4-7pm happy hour, they also have a late night happy hour during the week after 9pm with $4 margs and $1 off tacos. Such a great deal!"}
{"text":"Started off good with happy hour drinks and tacos. Fell apart when I ordered a second drink. 30 minutes later, I just canceled and asked for the bill. 20 minutes later a bill actually came. Disappointed in the service for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars at this particular Barrio location, and are supporters of the company overall. We love the fresh chips and salsa, copious vegetarian options, spicy hot sauces, ridiculous whiskey and tequila options, well-curated craft beer list, and general vibe. We also appreciate having an awesome place to get late night eats in Lakewood that isn't a greasy spoon. We are not normally Yelp-ers, but we felt inspired to post a positive review tonight in response to the negative review posted by Tony L. We were present and witnessed the interaction between Tony's party and the management. What Tony failed to mention in his highly-enlightened review is that he and his group attempted to take over and push together a bunch of high-top tables in the bar area without any approval from the staff. There is hosted seating at Barrio, and if they had taken the time to work with the staff, their entire party could have been seated together, in a timely fashion, without issue. Instead, they chose to take seats that did not belong to them, in a manner that impeded the staff's ability to serve the rest of the dining room. When confronted about their entitled behavior, they lashed out at management and posted their ridiculous \"review\". To all who might read Yelp for restaurant advice, please do not heed Tony's  advice. Barrio is awesome, and their staff treats guests with respect and courtesy. However, as it should be everywhere, if you act like a dick, you will be treated like a dick. Act like a drunk dick, expect to be thrown out. You are not entitled to anyone's service."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff. Service was good, but our was so crowded. Better than the downtown location I guess."}
{"text":"Barrio is consistent, solid and so cheap. The happy hour is a total bargain - tacos are $2 and margaritas are $3. It's lively but not too loud. Overall worth going to - especially if you can grab a patio spot when it's warm.  A lot of the margaritas are a bit too sweet for me. I prefer classic to flavors like jalapeño and blood orange.  You build your own tacos with a pencil and paper checklist menu, like The Happy Dog. I usually get two and it's plenty for me. Lots of great vegetarian options. The tofu is zippy (although a bit too liquidy), and the black beans do just fine. Definitely add the slaws, and get a bunch of sauces on the side to test out."}
{"text":"Food was great, I had three tacos (coca cola marinated steak, spicy chicken, and pulled pork) and they were all quite good. I enjoyed the concept and variety on the menu, would definitely have to try the queso next time. Biggest disappointment, and the only reason I didn't go 5 stars was the service. Our waiter was slow, inattentive, took an order for a beer that we were told ten minutes later was no longer available. We had at least 6 other instances where different servers came by with other people's food asking if it was ours...some real disorganization when it comes to managing the orders for each table. It was busy, but not so busy that there was a wait, so this was a little disappointing. Regardless, I'll definitely be back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Barrio. It is in expensive and yet they will be the best tacos of your life! Every location is always packed and for good reason. You must try!"}
{"text":"Great food - long waits at high times + great outside dog friendly patio.  We came here with friends for dinner and drinks.  The wait was long but thats fine on a Friday night at 7pm.  What wasn't great was that the bartenders just ignored us.  I'm talking no eye contact or drinks for half the bar for over 30 mins.    Once we were seated things got much better.  The tofu was possibly the best I have ever had.  I highly recommend the tofu!  We loved sitting outside with the pups in the nice weather.  I would come back at not so busy of a time."}
{"text":"The Happy Dog of tacos is the most accurate way to describe this place and HOT DOG are they good! I stared at the menu for a good twenty minutes determined to create the two most delicious taco creations one had ever seen. I do believe I succeeded but the good news is that I don't think you could go wrong with your choices - everything on the menu was pretty much fabulous.  We were craving guac so we ordered the 3 amigos (2 guacs and a queso to mix it up) and the queso ended up being the unanticipated favorite of the night.   The service and margaritas are what is bringing this place down to the 3 star level. They only served happy hour specials at the bar (however our waiter said they were considering changing that) and our when our waiter messed up our order he did not apologize but instead looked at us as though we were the ones that were wrong.  The margaritas were also extremely disappointing. We tried ordering one of the specialty ones and when we weren't satisfied with those we thought we'd try out the original. Both were extremely sour and difficult to drink.   Go here for the food but pass on the margs. It's a shame because they have a beautiful patio that would be a great place to have enjoy a summer drink."}
{"text":"Had a great time, wasn't familiar with the menu or concept but the staff made it a good experience. Had countless people wait on us and make sure everything was ok. Great casual dining experience, will return and recommend anyone to visit! Food was  awesome! Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for street tacos, this is not the place. They should explain that up front. Very Americanized, lots of sauce and cheese. The service was good and she was knowledgeable. Didn't eat most of the food we ordered, but said we \"ordered too much\" so she didn't inquire.  Very hipster vibe..."}
{"text":"TACOS ARE SO GOOD AND THE QUESO IS AMAZING!!!! Margz are good too. Service is never great but I'm never there in a rush. Usually there to hangout for awhile so it doesn't matter too much."}
{"text":"So I visited Barrio with a friend and we were sooo excited for our Tacos and Tequila. All the wait staff was nice and polite. My friend was excited that she got her extra lettuce on her taco. Then we found... Something hard in her taco :-( we let one of the staff members know and manager Kevin came out. He was very nice and took our complaint serious. He told out what the hard material was and notified us of what they found, he also went the extra step and made sure we we satisfied. Thank you Kevin for making what could have been an awkward experience and good experience!!"}
{"text":".  First and foremost, I LOVE the decor. Anyone who knows me, knows that I have a thing for skulls and they are everywhere. I love it. My happy hour foolishness starts here. My friend and I frequent here. The food is great. Everything has been flavorful and you can customize your order.I ordered three tacos at one time but I was stuffed. I will say the service can slack at time which is pretty annoying. I have been here a few times and there is always some issue. The server forgets a drink or is inattentive though there might not be many people. As my friend loves this place, I guess I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Disappointed in the new location. I LOVE barrio and was so excited for an east side spot close to home. I literally crave their brunch bloody Maria's that I first had in tremont. I've found my service here to be fine, but not great ie asking for refills on water and. It being very attentive. My food here has not been to the same par as tremont or Lakewood. And most sadly the drinks have not been as tasty. The last house margarita I had was so salty I couldn't drink it. The last bloody Maria was spicy and had chunks of what felt like tomato paste in it. The server never even asked if our drinks were ok even though we didn't even drink half of them. I'm sure I will be back out of sheer love for the barrio brand, but it will be a long while before we give it another whirl."}
{"text":"I've been to every location and have yet to be disappointed (except for that time, I tried food I hate. My fault not theirs). Last night my BF had me try the guacamole last night and it's the best guac I have had yet. I am not a guacamole fan by any means and I really enjoyed this! Recipe please."}
{"text":"I have an unhealthy obsession with tacos already, and Barrio is basically the (cringe-worthy) version of black-tar heroin for my addiction.  I only come into Cleveland occasionally, and I end up here at least twice a visit because it's the HOLY GRAIL of taco joints. Literally, I can think of no easily accomplished way to improve it. The staff is courteous, the locations are convenient, and the tacos are like manna from heaven. Customizable, varied, and delicious, these tacos are a different experience every time, and each round features overwhelmingly positive options.  The margaritas here are dynamite as well, and the accouterments knock it out of the park. (Solid guac, salsas, bourbons, and craft beers) They're open late, so it's an option for those who are looking to finish the night with the happiest of endings.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Why is this place packed?  We stopped by because of the great reviews and were disappointed by the small portions, wet, non exciting and undelicous tacos. Margaritas were weak and tasted like it had sour mix in it. Cmon guys. You're a taco place. You could do so much better."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for tacos. It's a made to order menu, similar to Happy Dog. Everyone one if the servers are extremely friendly and fun. The GM Bart is our favorite and always take the time to say hello. When you ask for a recommendation they always know what goes best with what you are looking for! If I could eat here everyday I would!!"}
{"text":"Good tacos and happy hour specials. The traditional guacamole's is a hit or a miss."}
{"text":"Have tried different Barrio locations around Cleveland and when the new location in DTW popped up wasn't really interested.  Friend of our wanted to meet there for dinner and figured what the hell... give it another shot.  Much to my surprise I could not have had a BETTER experience.  The food.... fresh, delicious, hot, and EXACTLY how I ordered it.  The restaurant... upbeat but not loud.  The service... can't say enough about how amazing and accommodating they were.  Also, their drink list is phenominal with more choices I could have ever imagined.  If you're in DTW it is a new 'must'... worth whatever the wait might possibly be."}
{"text":"Good drinks and good feel to the place.   I get what they are trying to do here.  Problem is.. when there are so many ingredients to pick from... you have to make sure they all are up to par.  The chicken on my tacos was so dry it blew my mind.  Also, when you do al a carte ordering.. make sure you pay attention to what the person orders.  I hate HATE red onions and guess what magically appeared throughout all my tacos.  You guessed it.. red onions.  Asked the server why.. she said she didn't know cause I didn't order them.  They fixed it.. only to now have another random ingredient thrown in.  Maybe I'm the one not in on some social experiment but it was annoying.  By the time this got fixed I was full from chips :)  lots of people like this place so maybe I'm the weird one here.. but it's my review!!"}
{"text":"My daughter, who attended CSU recommended we all go to this place close to the stadiums. Primarily a taco restaurant and they do a damn fine job! Guac is smooth and flavorful, chips made fresh. Hard shell tacos are fried fresh, so they are light and crispy. I liked the braised short ribs most of the beef options, similar to barbacoa.  We all enjoyed our tacos and margaritas were ok, didn't seem to have much tequila in it at all. This place is busy so be prepared to wait or if you get seated promptly, a decent wait for entrees if you have plans after your meal. Decor is pretty cool and very traditional  of what you'd see throughout Mexico celebrating Day of the Dead. (It's a very positive and celebratory remembrance of loved ones they've lost, not scary or morbid like Halloween is to us)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere - casual w indoor and outdoor seating  Great tacos - build your own! Absolutely delicious!! Didn't try the margaritas this time, but will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very weird tacos the chicked tasted like there was cinnamon in it and they were ice cold. Surprised so many people rave about this place"}
{"text":"If you want to get into this joint and not have a wait, go early. Always, always a wait and it is very crowded and cramped. However, all that being said, it is so worth it.   It is such a fun restaurant with great paintings all over the wall. They have one of the best margaritas that come in all different flavors. The tacos are fresh, it's a fun way to order, and be prepared you always will order more than you can eat BUT they taste even better the next day, especially for breakfast with some eggs.   I highly recommend this place with a group of friends or a really fun date. We go here too much and I wouldn't change that! They also sell Christmas ale in July which is hard to find...and it's tapped!"}
{"text":"After almost 9 months of coworkers telling me to check this place out, I finally did. Holy smokes do I wish I hadn't waited! It was phenomenal. I was nervous about the mix and match for the tacos but I don't think you could make a bad taco there. I loved the feel and vibes from the variety of people working and eating there. Just an overall positive experience!"}
{"text":"Yum! Barrio is soo tasty! Tacos start at $4 and they're topped with really yummy ingredients that you choose.  I was there with a friend and we also ordered their specialty guacamole at the time, which was their pumpkin guacamole. I thought it was fantastic and a really fun surprise.  Our waitress was amazing. She was attentive, timely, polite and quick! Overall my experience here was great! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Holy cow...finally! I had a taste of Barrio.  The tacos were amazing and I often think about wanting to go back to try more versions of their tacos.  The service was very carefree and easy.  They seat you, take your order and then deliver the tacos.  Beyond that, it's hard to get their attention :/"}
{"text":"There are many cheaper and better Mexican alternatives in CLE. The ambiance is good but the food is soso- The tacos are cold, the service slow and it is not really that tasty."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks are overpriced and not the best. But again the tacos are worth the trip:)"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot to go for tacos and drinks for a night. Great atmosphere and location. Staff is really nice and the service is good to. I suggest not getting sweet corn as it it overly sweet for me and takes away from the taste of the food. You can build your own tacos as well which is a cool feature. The guac is awesome as well. I'd recommend going with the sampler and trying a few!"}
{"text":"Passing through Cleveland for the night and found this gem of a place. Server was pleasant and nice and menu ordering process was easy. Great vegan options and food was great.  Solid beer list as well. Wish they were in Chicago. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place. Drinks are amazing and you cant get any better than their build your own tacos. Haven't had a bad experience yet. Highly recommend, I just wish they had more locations closer but worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Excellent service from the moment our host, Greg, greeted us as the door until the moment we walked out, despite how busy the restaurant was as a whole. Great food as well, of course."}
{"text":"I'm actually on my way out the door to visit Barrio for the second time today ('nuff said). I live right across the street from Barrio in Lakewood and it has become my favorite go-to spot. Not only is the food delicious (can we say queso anyone?!), but the drinks are spot on, too. Not to mention, it's vegetarian and vegan friendly, which is always a major plus. YAY BARRIO!"}
{"text":"Called to inquire if their patio was dog friendly on Fridays. \"Yeah sure!!!\" I was told. The next day, we get there and was told, only small dogs, that can be carried through the restaurant to the patio. Yeah that wasnt gonna happen as we didnt have dogs that could be carried!!! So we ended up going to another dog friendly restaurant patio.  What I can say is that the restaurant looked adorable, and there were gluten free options on the menu. Thats actually why we wanted to check them out."}
{"text":"I love the idea for this place. Fill out what you want, they bring it out, etc. From what I've had, it's quite good as well. However, it seems a bit pricey for the amount of food you get. A couple small tacos for $7 doesn't seem like a good deal when you can get a huge burrito or bowl from chipotle for $6.25. I thought getting a bowl from here would be good since I can't have the flour tortillas but it was so small. It came in one of those bowls that other Mexican restaurants serve there salsa for chips in. Kind of a let down. Having said that, their \"stoner\" tacos are very good. Great concept, much like the double decker taco from Taco Bell but with guacamole instead of beans. I really don't like guac but the way they put this together works with all the stuff you can throw in it. Extensive margarita selection which I find pretty cool. The chips were stale but overall I'd say Barrio is....meh. I'd go back with friends but I'm not going to pick it out of a lineup for food choices."}
{"text":"Excellent taco place / bar that both hipsters and families alike can and will enjoy. The fact you're reading this Yelp review will help immensely-- there's so many choices, the menu can be overwhelmingly so it's best be ready & have idea what you want, lest your indecisive self feels bad about the line of people waiting to get in.  It's essentially build your tacos, with scantron type forms you fill out to create your own taco masterpiece. There are literally hundreds of combinations -- though there are some predesigned \"chef choices\" offered in case you don't want to do the heavy lifting. Chips and salsa are complimentary though queso, guacamole and fancy salsa are available as starters too. I had the pineapple guac and it was so tasty and probably enough for 3-4 people. The tacos are average size but if I recommend one of the three special soft+crunchy shells such as the Green Goddess  ($1 extra) which really add volume, texture and taste to your taco. 2 of them probably make a good meal for the average person. I built mine with braised beef and Coke marinated steak ($1 up charge). Among the toppings I had were 2 (of 3) kinds of cheeses, jicama slaw, red cabbage, pineapple salsa, cilantro & onions, chipotle lime aoli and chipotle pesto. Extensive drink menu as well! Staff was very attentive, friendly and quick! Only complaint is it's pretty small inside (especially in winter when there's no patio) so you might encounter a wait. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It is Thursday at 7pm (game night).  The place is crowded with 20mins wait for a table.  I found a seat at the bar instead.  The bar table is very sticky which is gross.  And there were drunk and loud folks from all different angles.  Waited for 10mins before any bartender pay attention to me.  Finally able to order 2 tacos (chef special - fish & thick bacon).  Had to pay upfront prior to being served with a water and had to ask for the chip/salad.  The tacos arrived fairly quick, but both tacos were ice cold.  The fish one was gross as it was not fresh (mussy texture and dry). The bacon one barely has any meat in it.    Don't understand why all the great review.  Drunk people + $3 taco = 5 stars ratings?!?  Where did the standard go?"}
{"text":"I must say that last night we had one of the worst experiences ever at a Barrio. We showed up for late night, seating at the bar, which was about 3/4 full. It took about 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us, by simply dropping some chips and salsa in front of us and then staring at us. Finally asking if we actually wanted a drink. After this the bartenders were nothing but completely un attentive to us, as we would run out of chips it would take at least 10 minutes before they would even notice. The lack of attention and just absolute disrespect that we felt as customers was appalling. Mind you, the bar was less than half full at this point and there was maybe 2 tables with customers in the restaurant. We would have stayed for at least one more margarita, if not more had it not been for the horrible, horrible service. I will certainly not be returning to this Barrio, and it will be a hot minute before I even think about going to another Barrio location. Hey Barrio, get some better staff at this location!"}
{"text":"1) If I were a barfly, this is where I'd come to exist as such. The atmosphere is just plain cool. 2) The service is low-maintenance, and brisk 3) The menu is build-your-own, at about $3/taco. Expansive and highly customizable.  I only have one beef about this place: it's hit or miss with my own experimental taco concoctions. Which of course is partially my fault, but I feel like even when I select non-spicy items (my mouth and I don't enjoy spicy), my tacos almost always burn my face off.  I found one winning combination though, and I kept my checklist so that I can enjoy it time and time again..."}
{"text":"Barrio is a Cleveland institution of excellent tacos, and excellent drinks that includes an impressive tequila list.  There are no reservations so it can be a bit of a wait to get a table on busy nights...but the bartenders will take care of you with great libations to help with the wait.  Someone might ask \"hey is this place great for a group based on your last statement?\" Well actually yes it can be! Sunday brunch time is a great time to bring a group. Pro(Taco)-Tip: Get there around 11 and your group should have no problem (just had 16 people there yesterday!)  Be sure to check out the monthly specials menu...always something new and exciting!"}
{"text":"Barrio is hands down probably the best taco place I know of, the tacos are pretty cheap considering by the time you finish the queso you can only really eat one or two of them. Great place to meet up with others and especially at this location I've never waited longer than 15 minutes for a table, so"}
{"text":"Awesome food, awful service. Matt, the bartender, has served me a few times and he is always such a buzzkill! He seems so miserable working there - unfortunately his attitude is infectious and I never want to stay long. I have worked in the service industry many years and I know that it takes very little effort to at least pretend to have a good time. Also, his bartending skills are sub par. I'll be sitting in the dining room or ordering take out from Barrio from now on."}
{"text":"My first time here was on a Friday night, maybe about 7ish. The place was PACKED. The hostess couldn't give me a time frame for how long the wait would be, but she assured me it wouldn't be long. Since we were only a party of two, she was right--it was maybe ten minutes max--I had just finished paying for my drinks at the bar when the hostess came to seat us. We were put at a small two-top in the bar area, where people were crowding around, trying to get a drink and waiting for a table. There is no area for people to wait in while they are waiting for a table, so it gets crowded, which can be annoying when you're trying to enjoy your dinner. The waitress was very nice and enthusiastic (I think her name was Victoria? At least according to our receipt it was), she checked on us often, and did a great job of explaining the menu and making recommendations.  The margartias--soooooo good. Much better than the margs you get at a typical mexican restaurant. You know what else they had here that was better than your typical standard Mexican restaurant? The chorizo. My boyfriend loves this stuff (aka queso fundido) and always gets it, but it's always too greasy for me to eat. We got it here, and I couldn't stop eating it!!! Their salsa was also very good.  This is a build your own taco place, and they did a great job of giving you plenty of options meat, to cheeses, salsas, etc. I tried a chicken one and a shredded beef one. I do think there wasn't really enough chicken--I couldn't even taste it. The beef was really good, although I waited too long to eat the taco--when I picked it up, it fell apart!! Hah, it was still good, and I preferred it over the chicken.  For $3, with the amount of toppings you can get, this place is fabulous. I would even for back just for a margarita."}
{"text":"I went to Barrio around 615pm on a Tuesday evening.  It was packed!    The scene is deserving of 5 stars - great decor, hipster fun vibe.  Good drink selection.  However, the tacos left much to be desired.  While reasonably priced at $3 ea (specials or other things cost more), I felt like the tacos were something I could make myself at home and taste just as good.  I am vegetarian, so the meat toppings might be what sets Barrio tacos over the edge.  The service was just OK.  A number of people actively working hard to keep up with the crowd.  We sat at the bar and it took a while to get out order in.  Food delivery was pretty quick after that."}
{"text":"The best chips and salsa anywherere!  I've had a few taco's I have made myself and they aren't as good as their ones on menu or monthly specials.  Bowls are small and nickel and dime for every extra topping option.  Overall good food."}
{"text":"This place is great. The tacos are a good size and very good. You have the option of making your own or choosing a pre made one. All are great. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Sage was our server and she was great. 9 guys from all over US in town for training. 9 separate bills. She explained everything great, food was phenomenal and Sage really went the extra mile to make sure we felt welcome!!"}
{"text":"Does Barrio even need a review? Well, I'll give you one anyway. Barrio is hands down one of my favorite go to spots when I'm craving tacos. My favorite part is that you can create your own. You can get everything you want in your taco and nothing you don't want. One of the things that makes their tacos so great is the stoner shell. It's a hard shell surrounded by chorizo queso and then a soft shell. I can't eat my tacos without it. They also have a vegetarian version! If you're not feeling very creative or want to choose a taco that's already put together, they have a menu to choose from. They also have great margaritas and a nice beer selection. This place can get super crowded (like hour wait for tacos crowded) so I would suggest going at a less traditional time. If you're looking for brunch, they have that too! Not only can you get amazing tacos, when I was there they also had this French toast bowl that was to die for. Barrio will never let you down!"}
{"text":"Skimpy taco filling.  Deep-fried corn tortilla - cold.  Why? Because profit come from drinks.   Good flavors, interesting options, fun decor.  Come here to be seen because the blasting music prevents conversation.  Just like at the state fair, all service ware is paper, plastic, and foil. Garbage, garbage, garbage.  Very classy.  I don't know what Barrio is doing with the revenue saved by lacking a dish operation, but it sure isn't filling the tacos."}
{"text":"I'll never eat any other taco again (this is not a sexual reference).  Earth shattering tacos, seriously.  Chipotle--nope never again, Taco bell--not even if I was blacked out drunk, any other family owned Mexican restaurant--just take tacos off the menu.  Edit: tacos are still good but service is getting shotty at the downtown and Lakewood Barrio...."}
{"text":"Best taco I've ever eaten. Went to Barrio on Saturday night and have been thinking about the 'White Widow' taco I customized ever since... You know a place deserves 5 stars if you can't stop thinking about the meal you had. Great space, great atmosphere, great food, great house margs, AND at a great price... WILL BE RETURNING SOON."}
{"text":"Barrio has consistently great food in a great location. However, there are most certainly a few aspects of their service they could improve. For one, attentiveness could definitely use improvement. After your drink order is taken, you can never be too sure of when you will see your waitress next. This sometimes leads to unfortunate situations such as your food being brought out before your chips and salsa...and if you're anything like me, you're stomach demands a ransom of at least chips and salsa in order to hold you over until the main event without getting hangry or unpleasant. A simple improvement to customer service would be a quick solution to both issues.   Another suggestion I have (unrelated to service) is to offer sour cream for half the price and half the size. I LOVE sour cream. However, I don't need the equivalent of an entire tub for $1. I NEVER use it all, so I would most certainly be happy as a clam with half the amount at half the price.   Aside from these few grievances, barrio is the bomb.com and one of the best options for late night grub that you don't have to do a walk of shame home from after indulging."}
{"text":"This is my first review of anything since moving back to Cleveland, and man am I excited at all the great places I've found. Not to sound all up my own butt, but after living off of Randolph St. in Chicago for so long, I kinda wondered how my old hometown would hold up. Do I expect everyone to be the same Iron Chef quality? Certainly not. But do I think that Cleveland can hold its own? Absolutely. Which is why I predict myself complimenting a ton of places in the near future.   Before I get to the food, let me compliment the service. Kind, quick, and with a smile. This is the most significant difference I've noticed since moving back. After living in Chicago so long, Cleveland definitely feels more Eastern than Midwest. Basically put, a lot of service here veers toward the rude side. People do things their way, at their pace, and you as the customer deal with it. Not at Barrio. Attentive, no attitude, just awesome.   The food. The chips and elote queso are delicious. Perfection. Doing the hard/soft combo of taco shells with guac and other goodies in the middle gives them that extra oomph that other restaurants don't have. There's just one little thing, and I sincerely hope the owners/managers take it to heart and not brush it off as just another Yelper. The technique on some of the items needs a little tweaking. For example, the pulled pork was dry. That just shouldn't be. The pineapple salsa was really watery. A little draining is all you need to fix that up. And the guacamole had a...hmmm, let's say \"effervescence\" that guacamole definitely should not. You know, it kinda tasted like soda. That's definitely a sign that one of the ingredients has started to turn. But these are all easy fixes in technique, and I have faith that they can do it.  All in all, I'm a big fan, and they make me excited to be back!"}
{"text":"I love this Barrio location! The staff is always friendly and the food and drinks are fantastic. I love the blackberry margarita with ginger sugar on the rim."}
{"text":"it's a very good place for a late night snack! I love that ordering is like taking a scantron test but it actually comes back with tacos! It's not a 5 star review because I think that they should add some more ingredients to their menu."}
{"text":"Obsessed! If my friends would come here with me every other day I would be here weekly! Obsessed with the shrimp tacos. Great brunch items as well! You can't go wrong with anything you get here!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here; we have tried pretty much every taco on regular rotation.  The environment is clean and the servers are kind and efficient.   If you order any of the breakfast bowls or tacos, know that they are a lot more filling than their regular fare.  My favorite tacos are el filidelfia, el puerco and carne trozo, but, they are all tasty.   You will also receive complimentary chips and salsa.   Beer and margarita selection is good!  There is also a nice patio area in the back with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We were excited to try the new Barrio location which opened in our very own Lakewood last month. We'd been to the Tremont one a few times and had good experiences so last night, off we went for some booze and tacos.   5 stars: TACOS, atmosphere/art $3 for the basic taco which you can pick and choose your toppings, meat and shell? Hells yes! So many combos its hard to pick - there are a few chef's recommendations if you aren't feeling creative. All I've had have been excellent. Art on the walls is the same awesome skeleton motif that is found in the original Barrio. I love it and have never seen anything quite like it. The atmosphere is just the right amount of dark.   4 stars: queso and service We were seated after a minimal (probably 10 min) wait at the bar at around 8pm on a Friday. Not too shabby in my estimation. The service was friendly, prompt, and just the right amount of attentive.   We tried the queso with chorizo. At first it wasn't so great because they just dump some chorizo sauce stuff into a mortar with the melted queso cheese. It was a little greasy looking and weird at first. But once it all starts to get mixed together....really really good. We had to stop ourselves so we had room for tacos.   3 stars: The specialty margaritas I tried were so-so. The grapefruit one 'Frida's Kahlo' I believe, barely had any flavor at all. Definitely did not taste much grapefruit and certainly not much booze. I get it, it has 'good tequila so it should be smooth'....sure but pardon me if it should also taste like an alcoholic drink. The second one I tried was better - pink with lime and orange. Can't recall the name but it had more flavor, although I still found it quite weak. Typically if I'm drinking two margaritas (and spending 16 bucks total on them), I will feel a slight buzz after that. Not AT ALL with Barrio.   Overall, this is a good spot. I LOVE the hand painted art on all the walls. So unique and fun to look at while you drink and dine. I would definitely recommend the tacos and queso. For the margaritas, I'd stick to the traditional ones or maybe the ones I didn't try are better. Overall very glad this new addition is in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Barrio it is delicious which explains why it's always so busy. No matter what location you go to usually a nightmare to get a table. With that being said the menu is delicious the food quality is great everything is so good staff is usually pretty awesome and they also have a lot of suggestions for different kinds of tacos. Also they have amazing salsas and guacamole!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday evening around 7pm and were seated immediately.  This was our first visit to Barrio and the server explained the ordering process to us and made a few recommendations.  We started with the house margarita, which was very good.  We enjoyed the queso and several of the tacos!  I was only able to eat 1 taco after a few margaritas and chips!  My husband was able to eat all 3 that he ordered.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"El Jeffe taco - amazing. Wonderful flavor, good sized taco. The chipotle honey sauce was great!  El Puerco taco - wonderful. Again, great flavor. Juicy pulled pork. Very filling.   The atmosphere is very cool and hip. Great hangout and looks like a great bar."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Barrio restaurant, and we were really happy with our tacos. It was fun to experiment with different toppings, and this vegan was totally pumped for so many options.   The chips and salsa served when we sat down were delicious, and I stuck with water to drink while my husband had a beer. (He said the beer prices were a little high.)  They did mess up our order (imagine my surprise biting into pork) but replaced it with the correct taco very quickly. The staff was very friendly. We experimented with some suggested tacos but also built our own (we were hungry!)  We will definitely be returning - looking forward to trying more taco combinations...and a margarita next time! We ordered three tacos, but agreed that two would be perfect.   Yelp just told me my review is looking pretty epic, so I will stop while I am ahead."}
{"text":"I was excited to take my fiancé here upon moving back to cleveland from nyc. he's from nyc and when living there we would go for tacos at least once a week. while nyc pales in comparison to LA when it comes to tacos, they're still pretty amazing.   i'll start by saying i definitely had one of the best margaritas of my life at barrio... frozen pomegranate. super delicious. as for the tacos, there is absolutely nothing mexican about them. they are what olive garden is to italian food. i like the idea of essentially building your own taco and i tried to make mine as close as to what i would normally get in nyc (carnitas with onion and cilantro) but at the end of the day, building your own tacos really are no where near as good as having a great recipe for some staple tacos. one gigantic let down is the soft shell being flour... reminds me of when my mom made tacos from the Ortega taco growing up... and while i loved it then, it's just not good for a real taco. it's doughy and overwhelming. the taco shell should be the last thing you notice in your taco and basically just a vehicle for the insides. a smaller double up corn tortilla would be so much better. i hate when people complain about portions of food being too large but these tacos are too big, mainly because of the flour tortillas. if the tacos were smaller you could try a lot more combinations.   i wouldn't hurry back, especially since the service wasn't very good for a tuesday night and being one of two other tables."}
{"text":"If you are craving tacos in Cleveland, this is a very good option. You can customize your taco which is great, but can also be difficult with the amount of choices. I sat in the bar area, and there was a pencil and paper where I checked off what I wanted. You choose the type of tortilla, protein, cheese, salsa, sauces, and additional sides. I got 4 tacos, which had the following combinations: soft tortilla, spice marinated chicken, shrimp with garlic cream, black beans, cilantro-lime rice, sautéed peppers, lettuce, cilantro and onions, tomatoes, apple jicama slaw, red cabbage, corn salsa with peppers, salsa verde, cilantro pesto, and cilantro/lime aioli. I know, it almost sounds exhausting, but I figured I am in Cleveland, so I got to go big! All 4 tacos were terrific! And they really filled up the taco to the fullest which I appreciate. In addition, they provide complimentary chips and salsa. Chips were a little too salty, which is an issue for a lot of Mexican places.   Service was a little slow, but it didn't annoy me a ton since I wasn't in a rush and the place was crowded. The restaurant has multiple rooms, a bar area with flat screen TVs, and skeleton paintings on the wall. Out of all the meals I had in Cleveland, this is towards the top of my list!"}
{"text":"Food was great but, they forgot to put the cheese on my taco, and then the taco fell apart. Overall though food was good beef could have been a little saltier along with the chips, but that's just how I feel."}
{"text":"Am I allowed to say this place is overrated without the entire city of Cleveland burning my house down? The food isn't bad but it's ALWAYS packed. You're facing at least a 20 minuet wait no matter when you go. For most people this isn't really a big deal, but I get so hangry around dinner time that I even scare myself. And maybe I'm alone here, but I really don't feel like waiting 20+ minuets just to be seated for a mediocre taco.. However, if you just want to get a drink, the margaritas are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have tried to give this location a chance, at least 4 times. They keep disappointing me more and more, each time. I would suggest not getting take out from this location. Every time we have tried, the tacos have been extremely soggy, and cold. Their sauces are far too watery, and   by the time we walk back, they have turned into a glob of tortilla, if they aren't completely falling apart. I could see them being a little soggy, if we were late picking them up, but one of my co-workers waited 20 plus minutes past the quoted time before they came out. Plus, somehow their classic guac was both salty, and bland at the same time. Considering how great the Tremont location is, this one is a complete disappointment."}
{"text":"Great salsa with nice chipotle taste. Loved being able to \"build my own\" taco.  Many choices of proteins, toppings, and sauces. The hottest sauce is very flavorful, but will definitely light you up! Incredible, attentive, service from Sam! Delicious chorizo queso. Would definitely visit Barrio again."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a great experience! the sangria is my favorite sangria anywhere. The barrio secret sauce is hit or miss on the hot scale -- sometimes too hot, sometimes very mild. aside from that, always fresh ingredients, 9 out of 10 times a good server, fair prices, and the guac is no-nonsense. I live 3 blocks away and make it a point to go at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Barrio is the best! We always bring out of town guests here for dinner. We had one guest who was here for four nights and two of which we had barrio! The prices can't be beat, and the tacos are amazing. You build your own, and can add one rice, avocado or another protein for $1. Try their chef specials, too. My only complaint is that the margaritas are always weak, so I've stopped ordering them. The place is very casual, and always busy, except the wait time is never too bad. They will tell you how many tables are in front of you, not a time estimate usually, but tables rotate pretty quickly so it's not usually too bad!   Update: I went again on a Friday night and ordered margarita pitchers from the bar, and they were perfect! I could definitely taste the alcohol in them. Not sure if it made a difference because I was standing there watching them make the pitchers, but I was very happy with them. The bartender measured all the ingredients he put in, so hoping for the same consistency next time we go!"}
{"text":"Went last Saturday after the monsters game,  salsa was great,  margaritas were good but not very strong,  tacos= subpar. ...the build your own idea is awesome,  however for $3 my tacos barely had any meat in them,  I get more meat from the taco truck for half the price"}
{"text":"The good: the overall atmosphere is fun and lively. The chips, salsa, guac, and queso are always fantastic. Tacos are typically delicious, especially for the price. Staff is always friendly and energetic, and knows the drink menu well enough to make recommendations for other drinks you my enjoy if you like _____.  The margaritas and Chaco Tacos are fantastic!   The bad: it isn't uncommon for your order to be off when you receive it. You may have something missing, a different kind of meat, etc. The staff, although friendly doesn't typically check in too often due to how busy the restaurant is. This means waiting for drink refills, running out of chips and salsa. And when wait staff does check in, they don't stay long. This was particularly upsetting during my last visit, because pieces of steak in my taco was very undercooked... Practically raw,  and I didn't have an opportunity to alert the staff. The next day I found myself sick.   Barrio is better than serving raw meat, and I certainly hope it was an isolated incident."}
{"text":"Food is great, and killer during Happy Hour.. YOU decide what you want, meat, cheese, toppings, sauces, salsas, shells, all of it.. Just fill in the bubbles, and they do the rest.. Great margaritas, great chips, and great food.. Sadly, the \"normal\" service is less that should be expected, but is what is normal nowadays.. I've never had an issue... Plus the food would more than make up for it..."}
{"text":"Amazingly addictive margaritas with a flawless build your own taco menu... I've never made a taco that I didn't devour! By far my favorite restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I really like the food at barrio and the margaritas are amazing!! The last few times that I have gone to the Lakewood location they have messed up my tacos!! So that has made me not want to go to that location maybe I'll just go to the others ones kinda a disappointment."}
{"text":"Yes the guacamole is great and the drinks are good too. Not super impressed with the tacos though...some were kind of runny and not warm and our bowl of chips was small broken pieces...waitress gave me a weird look when I asked for more too"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch! They have a very cool bar downtown Cleveland. You order tacos any way you want. They are large and 2-3 will fill you up, with the great queso and guacamole. Try the garlic shrimp, with the mango salsa. Definitely a great casual restaurant/bar!"}
{"text":"A rare 5star rating from me. Here's the thing: I came here pretty much every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday. It's my favorite spot. Build your own taco with guac and queso specials. I was usually full before the tacos even came out. The service here wasn't always the best but the place is crowded so j always forgave them. The margaritas are delicious. This place has a cute little patio if you want some sunshine too."}
{"text":"Good tacos. Unique selections. Great brunch. Always packed....sometimes service can be spotty. A fun place to bring out of towners, but can be loud, crowded and hectic."}
{"text":"YUM! I asked my friends for recommendations of places to eat in Cleveland. Quite a few said \"Barrio!\", now I know why!   The restaurant is located in downtown Cleveland right next to the \"Arcade\" and the Cavs stadium. The food is simple but very tasty. You grab a piece of paper, let them know how you want your tacos then they make them to your specifications.   I choose the taco of the month, which was the buffalo taco. WARNING! They were HOT! The sauce was very good but it left your nose running and wishing you had a gallon of water.   I would go back for sure if I was in Cleveland! If you love tacos, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I love barrios...no matter the location. Make your own tacos are not only ingenious and delicious, but cheap! I will say I have had some bad experiences with the taco del dia- so I'd just stick to make Ur own. The guacs and quesos Del dia are usually clutch tho.  Def a must have in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Tacos are on point. If you catch a weekly special tog will not be disappointed. I would recommend this restaurant highly."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are delicious. The parking is well, good luck. The service is excellent but can be a little slow. You will wait for a table here, no matter what, and it is stressful to do a to-go order because of how you order. However, the food is just so good and there is nothing to criticize when you sit down so everybody just keeps coming back. If you are a visitor to Cleveland, this would be a cool and worthwhile place to check out!"}
{"text":"Wonderful all around.  Their drinks are some of the best in Tremont, and you can't beat the price.  Try a Diego's Desire, and top it off with their amazing corn queso"}
{"text":"I usually have a very good dining experience here but the last time I went the cook must have left the chips cooking a little too long, every new order of chips I'd ask for was very crispy and light brown beside that the house margaritas are fantastic and the garlic shrimp tacos I had were awesome."}
{"text":"If you don't like the tacos here you can only blame yourself because at Barrio, you get to design 'em!  The fixings, prep, and presentation are great.  The tequila list and margaritas are top-notch as is the décor and service.  Good chips and salsa too. Oh, if you're not expert on picking taco components, the servers are very willing to assist - and - they also have a daily taco special that you can fall back on it you don't want to build from scratch.  I'll be back again soon.  I wanna see more of Tremont too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Barrio! The tofu taco are to die for, and just the right amount of spicy. The restaurant lets you make your order on a sheet of paper, and there's a ton of different options to choose from. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For a recent parents' weekend, I booked an Air BnB in Tremont with my daughter. A local resident recommended Barrio and although it took us three tries to get seated in a reasonable time frame, I'm so glad we persisted! The place is busy, very buzzy and has fun decor. I went for the the chef's favorite taco suggestions, ordering the El Jefe and the El Puerco. Both were seriously delicious, with a memorable mix of soft and crunchy, savory and slightly sweet, and more than enough food for me. My daughter pronounced her build-your-own shrimp tacos equally good. I enjoyed a house margarita or two and she opted for a flavored one that she really liked. Prices are very reasonable, service was great and best of all, we could walk \"home\" after eating. Will definitely return next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Do you like tacos? Do you like good flavorful food?  Do you like margaritas? They just fill out the easy menu sit back and relax. $4 tacos and great drinks. Complimentary Chips and delicious salsa. I had steak and shrimp taco with the works and stoner shells and a margarita on the rocks. Start there"}
{"text":"Very very good and reasonably priced. getting a table can take a while but once you're seated the service is quick and attentive. The queso blanco is incredible, as is the pineapple salsa. Definitely gonna come here many more times."}
{"text":"Awesome murals decorate the walls, suuuuper friendly server made us happy (he even drew us out-of-towners a little map of breweries to check out during our weekend stay in Cleveland!) Great beer selections and decent cocktails as well made us happy. They have both create-your-own tacos as well as some specials and suggested taco combos. Tacos were good - filling - and I loved that you could add what you wanted though it can be a bit overwhelming to have so many options, and a bit confusing for your first visit. I recommend sticking with their tacos that they have created - those came out a bit better than the ones we tried to create ourselves."}
{"text":"Yes please!  Build your own taco(s) or pick from their list of taco suggestions. The margaritas are a must try. I've had their blood orange margarita and peach margarita, both winners.  Go, try and leave full!!"}
{"text":"Barrio was a really great taco place with a nice patio, good service and fair prices. I love the choice of build your own taco or pre-made tacos. I opted for two build your own tacos, one had pulled pork and the other was the pescato (fish) option in a hard+soft taco shell (highly recommend). The lime aioli was amazing on both my tacos. You also get unlimited chips and salsa! Visiting from out of town, I'm glad we got to see one of Cleveland's top places for tacos."}
{"text":"Probably the best margaritas in Cleveland and most of if not all of them are half off during happy hour.  Their tacos are huge and I love how you can create your own with the different meat, cheese, sauce, and shell combinations.  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Hate that it no longer is open for lunch. Nor can you reserve tables for large parties."}
{"text":"I like barrio but there is never any room to move. That's why I gave it a 4 star. The place is good to go love there tacos.. I must admit they are dank goodness. I love there pineapple salsa on a stoner taco with braised beef,white cheddar."}
{"text":"I frequent the Tremont location so I was excited to check out Barrios Lakewood joint. I was hesitant because it's a fairly new restaurant but I was impressed by how everything was very similar to the Tremont location, although I like the bar layout of the other location better.   I usually go to Barrio for one reason only, happy hour! Tacos are two dollars and you pick the ingredients yourself so it's a fun process. I usually make one spicy and one sweet. We also tried the chorizo queso for the first time and for someone that doesn't really like queso, this blew me out of the water. It was sooooo good. Barrio is a CLE happy hour staple!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite happy hour in Cleveland! $2 tacos and $1 off margaritas! The tacos aren't just your normal meat and cheese, but you get to pick a meat (pork, chorizo, chicken, steak, fish, etc) and a slue of other things like salsas, toppings, sauces and aiolis! It's so fun to make up different combinations to try! If you've been to Happy Dog the ordering system is the same. Btw, happy hour is weekdays Mon-Fri until 7pm but ONLY in the bar area. Fresh fun Mexican! Arribbbbbba!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. EVERYTHING here is delicious. The queso is a must!!! They have a lot of diff options for pitchers of margs and I like the flexibility of being able to create my own tacos"}
{"text":"Coming from Texas I had my eye on his place with high expectations! They don't disappoint! Tacos were stellar and the chips and queso were fresh! Food service was really fast even after the rush of a cavs game! Get the Barrio Sauce!"}
{"text":"The good news is that the food is cheap, usually fast, usually tasty and too cool for school trendy.  The service is typically not very friendly.  Don't sit at the bar unless you want the bartender to roll his eyes at you when you sit down,  and then judge your choices for being too mainstream. It's almost as if they don't want you at the bar.  The food is typically very tasty, but can sometimes be a bit off.  The blood orange margarita is fantastic- just don't order it directly at the bar if you can avoid it."}
{"text":"Like the concept of the build your own taco. The scorpion Trinidad hot sauce is so hot! I like this place, 3 tacos and a drink is perfect."}
{"text":"Firstly let me state I love Barrio, the Tremont location is awesome. This new location had a few problems.   Food was great as usual, well mine anyways. Two people at our table received completely wrong orders, I am guessing they got another tables but who knows. They fixed it quickly without any hassle so I would chalk it up to new place etc.  Location is nice, its been a hundred things I can remember, it is a much larger space than tremont. They did a nice job painting the place and it looks really cool, problem is there is bare walls and ceiling absolutely nothing to absorb sound. It was so loud you had to basically shout to be heard by the person next to you. Forget having a conversation with the whole table. I don't even think they had music playing it was just the echo from all the people in the place. Seriously if I hadn't been with a group I would have left before ordering food. I get that it would never be a quiet type of restaurant but having to shout concert style to talk is ridiculous.   I'll keep hitting up the Tremont location for the awesome food."}
{"text":"Wow, I am in love.  Went here with a larger group for a birthday and had an awesome time. First I will say probably not the greatest choice for a large party but they managed and we got through it.   Starters the salsa they bring with chips is ok, better than average but nothing to flip over. The drink made with wild turkey, ginger beer, and lime however is. It was simply amazing.   Tacos, I could not tell you what I ended up ordering exactly but all had the house made chorizo. Probably the best chorizo I have ever had, I would live on it. Seriously it was so good I would eat it like breakfast cereal. The jicama slaw was delicious as well. The only danger I see is that you yourself may order a poor combination of things and be let down. It would be easy to do at a build your own place with ingredients not everyone is familiar with.   Anyways service was great, and the food was great."}
{"text":"I always love Barrio. The new location in Cleveland Heights is no exception... however - maybe try not being so culturally insensitive... Patty = Patricia and Paddy = Patrick for your St Patrick's Day Guac. Reprint those specials cards please. One bartender was kind of a dick and Adam was a doll!"}
{"text":"Normally i would give 5 stars because when I'm there sitting down to eat it's always so good. But tonight i had my roommate bring me home two bowls and i was so disappointed. This is the 2nd time I've had this issue with take out. Both bowls were not even 1/4 of the way filled. Basically only had 2-3 bites in each bowl. They tasted great but for what you're paying i should have had more. Especially since i always get bowls and know how much i usually get. Hoping this won't happen again"}
{"text":"Are you in Cleveland to see the Cavaliers get beat? Are you in Cleveland to get tacos? Have you wandered into Cleveland trying to get to Buffalo? It doesn't matter. You need to stop at Barrio to get yourself some tacos. For $3 you get one hell of a taco. I recommend the calypso sauce for all of you risk takers. It's got some bite! OWWWWWWWWWW"}
{"text":"I feel like when they first I opened they were good and only went downhill after that. Which is weird and the opposite of what should happen. Service is consistently rude and slow. Tacos take so long to receive and by then they are cold and soggy.  They rarely get orders correct. Blah. Saving grace is chips to hold you over in your 30 minute wait for 2 tacos. Most overrated, irritating place."}
{"text":"Tacossssssssss this place has excellent build your own tacos. Great prices too! I've been told they have great margaritas so I'll have to come back."}
{"text":"The hype IS real. Every bite was like an explosion in my mouth.  In terms of quality I can't say if I've had anything better before coming here. Kind of wish the tacos we're bigger for those of us with bigger appetites."}
{"text":"so, don't get me wrong --- I love this place!  food is delish,price is right, and vibe is fun .... so why for the servers and bartenders have to be so surly?!?! lighten up guys - you work in a cool, fun place and you're bringing down the fun quotient ... I get it - you're hip but, honestly, hipsters smile too"}
{"text":"I came here so excited to try the delicious food I've heard about and experienced previously. As soon as I stepped inside this joint, I knew it would not be that experience. Barrio, more like Barri-NO. The miss appropriation in crowd control and lack luster ability in table turns was not as noticeable as their condescending staff. As I fought my way to the bar I ordered a simple drink and the condescending bartender decided to tell me how to make it. One individual in a legacy high school T-shirt made us feel as though we were second class citizens. Historically, I have been happy with Barrio, but this location is a disgrace to Barrio name and brand. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Very cool place. The atmosphere is so different and interesting.  Margaritas are amazing! I tried both the skinny skeleton and their house marg and both were awesome. They also have some of the best guacamole ive ever had! And the tacos are great! They great options to choose from and the way you order is very cool.  The only bad thing is that it is almost ALWAYS packed! We waited at least an hour for a table on a saturday night, and they do not take reservations.  But i would still definitely recommend and will for sure go back."}
{"text":"This place is so overrated and overpriced. They don't have a real menu and instead have a confusing notepad to build your own tacos. I thought I was going to have a cheap lunch since tacos were supposed to be three dollars, but due to my confusion, I ended up spending way more than I expected because of all the extra charges and misleading prices.   The restaurant itself has a loud atmosphere, so it's hard to have a conversation. They don't even have dishes and serve the food wrapped in paper, plastic, and foil, which seemed wasteful to me.  The food really wasn't very good either. I will go to Taco Bell next time for better and cheaper food."}
{"text":"I dare you to not fall in love with these tacos. If you like a larger menu and a lot of Mexican options- this isn't the place for you.  Just tacos and chips/salsa/queso for dinner, but that's because they're so tasty, with so many variations; there's no need to have a three page menu. Super fun decor and tasty drinks to top it off.  The downsides- long wait times on prime nights (of course), not-so-friendly hostesses, and service on the slower side.  I've always had pretty friendly servers, but I'm not overly impressed with service in general here, but nothing super negative. Every time I have brought a friend from out-of-town; they've been very impressed too, so overall, a local gem."}
{"text":"Barrio is truly one of the best Happy Hours in town! With $3 margaritas and $1 off tacos, you can eat and drink like royalty on a low budget.  They also are an extremely inventive group of people, introducing new and exciting dips, drinks and tacos each month.   At the Tremont location, one particular bartender makes the world's best margaritas with unique flavor profiles that even his coworkers don't know his recipes. I wish I could tell you the flavor but I can describe it as sweet with a bit of sour and potentially melony, but I could be way off."}
{"text":"Great happy hour discounts on margaritas, drafts, and build your own tacos. Friendly service and excellent food. Cool decor. It fits in perfect in downtown Willoughby in that it's young, fun, very loud, crowded, dark, and the parking sucks."}
{"text":"What can anyone even say about this place that hasn't already been said? It's delicious & is rated as one of the best tacos in the country. We are privileged to have it in the area.  I usually go for a Build Your Own taco, but have gotten the suggested tacos at lunch/dinner and at brunch as well. Delicious. You really cannot go wrong at Barrio.  The ingredients are high-quality, the prices are fair, the margaritas are cold and delicious, the staff is helpful & the everything is genuinely pretty great. If I had one complaint, it'd be that the tacos are often pretty wet, and become difficult to eat. Like not enough liquid was drained from the salsa or the meat, and it makes the tortilla difficult to handle. But that's seriously super nit-picky. I'll take a wet taco any day. ...Not like that. Get your mind out of the gutter & go get yourself a taco."}
{"text":"A few of my friends have been talking about how great their tacos were. So I had to try for myself. They have $2 taco night during happy hour & the tacos definitely lived up to the hype.   Make sure you try the hard & soft shell taco. I added black beans to mine with the chorizo and it was by far my favorite one.   Great place to hang out with friends. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best spots in Cleveland. I cannot talk about this place enough. There are 4 locations in the area, but this Tremont one is by far superior in location, quality, and service so I've decided to do my collective Barrio review here.   I go to Barrio for the endless complimentary chips and salsa, the delicious guac (traditional is best) and queso (definitely w/ chorizo), the great cocktail list (bloody orange marg or bloody maria for brunch), and the make-your-own tacos (I've had almost every one on the menu, but consistently stick to my own creation), but what keeps me coming back is the atmosphere, friendly staff, and that I've truly never had a bad experience. Plus, it's a very affordable meal for the level of quality - they also offer a happy hour on weeknights making it an even better deal. In addition, they're constantly changing their menu by offering a guac, queso, and taco that's different every month. I've also had the pleasure of meeting the owner a few times who is an absolute delight and is really involved in bettering the Cleveland community.  I love Barrio and try my best to make sure everyone I know loves Barrio too!"}
{"text":"I'm a taco fanatic. These are by far the best tacos I've ever had. Everything was bursting with flavor. They have a great selection of meatless options as well. The tacos are the perfect size and I love that you can build your own. I enjoy the casual feel of the location. The staff was helpful in explaining the process. I'll definitely venture downtown specifically for these tacos."}
{"text":"I tried this place after a cavs game and i was delightfully surprised by how good the food is.  This place has EXCELLENT tacos! I was very impressed by their double taco shells (one hard, one soft) and the size of these bad boys.  I ended up getting two tacos and my fiancé got 3. I honestly could've gotten away with just getting one taco because they are so large!   I definitely would come back here again. Also, tacos are only $3-4 each. What a steal!"}
{"text":"Great tacos, so many different combinations of shells, meats, toppings and sauces.  You can get a unique taco every time and never go wrong.  The drinks are pretty good but overpriced, the beer selection at the new Lakewood location is awesome.  Also it's open until 2am (on the weekend at least) making it a great place to end a night out."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here after 5 hours at rock and roll hall of fame. We are from San Francisco Bay Area so we have tried lots of tacos. This place is amazing, who knew you could get tacos like this in Cleveland ,Oh. ."}
{"text":"Love the chicken tacos with ghost pepper sauce. The queso dip is the best too. The only thing is this place needs to be bigger. It's always packed. Sometimes you have to wait 30 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"If you love tacos, you'll love Barrio. Every time you go has the capability of bringing a world of new flavors together based on decisions you make. It's like a choose your own adventure story but with tacos. I always get three tacos, two of my tried and true chorizo tacos and one wild card taco where I select proteins, toppings and sauces that sound good to me that day. They also have WONDERFUL cocktails and the service has always been great, even when they are jam packed. 10/10 will continue to return"}
{"text":"Very fine restaurant. Had the chipotle peanut bbq taco and corn fritter queso. Both were specials. Noisy as a taco bar should be. Don't know if it was pandora or a satellite music station but it felt like home. Weezer, bad religion, ect. Had Margaritas. The el Diablo was HOT! Loved it. They have Great Lakes \"Rye of the Tiger\". When we ordered it we got Great Lakes mason jars to take home. We had the nachos at Progressive field, but the actual location blows that away. If this was closer to home then melt would lose half my business. My wife would make me split time between here and melt.  Enjoy! #allin"}
{"text":"Okay, so its alittle crowded, and maybe today would've been a great day to kick on the air vause it was humid as hell even though the weather was great outside. The queso and mild dip was fantastic,and the fresh chips just kept coming. My date and I got 3 Tacos each, 2 Margaritas and 2 waters around $40. I totally recommed what ordered for someone new and adventurous. I purchased 3 Soft Tacos, with Chicken,Chorizo, and Beef respectively. They offer 3 different types of cheese so I added each to each respective Taco and I filled all 3 with all the free extras. I also added Pesto on the side for each and a small prder of rice for a extra $1. Honestly though, if you dont want to wait get there between 4 and 5pm because space was hella limited. For some reason, the patio wasnt open even though it was gorgeous out today. Also, you can get all of it on Uber Eats as well, but the visit is rewarded by all the random hand drawn creepy stuff on the walls surrounding all the yuppies you see in there restaurant lol. Just say. Check it out."}
{"text":"Build your own tacos!! Yes Please!! And for $3 each you can't go wrong.  The wait was a bit crazy but it was concert night.   If you love spicy do yourself a favor and order the Chupacabra.   It's a fiery Serrano pepper tequila concoction.... sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Went last night for late night food, service was great and the food was excellent like always. Barrio always has a nice selection of beers, which is nice. Probably one of my favorite restaurants to go to."}
{"text":"So here's the thing, I want to give this place 5 stars, but I just can't. I love the concept and all, but I never leave there feeling like I want to go back immediately - like I am with most taco places. However, it gets a solid 4 stars because of the unique concept, great customer service, and fun vibe."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst restaurant experience I've had in Cleveland. We walked into a loud  and dark atmosphere. The waitress seemed like she did not want to be there. The chips were great and so was the salsa, so we had high hopes for the food. Next we got some guacamole to go with the chips and it had no flavor! They need to take some tips from Chipotle on how to make guac. It tasted like it had been squirted out of a store bought bag. We then received our food, and it tasted worse than Taco Bell. The taco tortilla shells were about Giant Eagle grade quality, and nothing had that much flavor. I ordered the brunch biscuits and gravy. They were discolored, had no resemblance of biscuits and gravy, and only tasted like the egg that came on top. I would only ever go here for chips and salsa cause that's all that taste good and has flavor. The tacos here don't even compare to those at Bakersfield."}
{"text":"Out towners visiting! Check out the reviews and all I can say is YUM !! Their tacos are AMAZING!!! Order the Jefe and their house margarita!"}
{"text":"Hanging out in Cle,OH for a few days- made a couple stops here. Once after a Monsters game and once after a Cavs game.  I thought my husband was insane for suggesting we go back after the Cavs game; figure it would be crazy packed.  I was right, it was. But not horrible. After a couple minutes we found two seats at the bar.  Had a few drinks on both trips, along with some queso, chips and salsa.  All good. I thought the bar tenders were super quick.   The crowd seemed super friendly. Would def. come back on my next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"The workers and food were fine but i was extremely offput by the slum-lord like manager who walked the restaurant like some inebriated clown he even tried to flirt with my 14 year old son  HOW CREEPY and when he isn't spitting game at minors he's slamming margaritas and doing coke in the restroom NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"I guess I'm just not drinking the Barrio kool aid.   The food is fine. It's yummy, but I've never been astounded by anything I had there. The drink options are solid too.  For me, it's just? that the menu isn't worth the loud atmosphere and slowish service.  I'd rather go to an authentic, family-owned? restaurant? for tacos. I know some places where I'd get twice the food for half the price and awesome? service."}
{"text":"The price is definitely worth the serving of food. I had a steak fajita, and I was pleased with my meal. I had ordered a non-alcoholic piña colada with my meal. The server brought me an alcoholic piña colada. I had to request that he bring me a virgin drink. The drink was humongous though! Mmm! :)"}
{"text":"My first run around with Barrio was average but I think ordering the right thing is crucial! Go with the things that can't go wrong on a taco like chicken and guacamole! The green goddess was amazing and changed my experience at Barrio! I shared an order of guacamole with a group (definitely good portion to share with 4!). Loved the margaritas and service is speedy and friendly!"}
{"text":"A poor experience here tonight. Was told 40 minutes  for our party of 4 when we walked in and got a beeper. Waited outside for 45 minutes and I checked in. Hostess said still 4 parties in front of mine. Ok, another 20 minutes. That goes by and our beeper goes off. They are trying to put us a table for 3, Then tried to pretend that they called the wrong party. Reset our beeper and handed it back to us. No explanation, just handed it back.The manager was not very nice when I tried to talk to him about it. I get it was a busy Saturday night, but you can't afford to underestimate wait times, and you certainly can't be indifferent to your loyal customers. Our server and the food quality, as always, were on point."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this 4 stars is because of the general wait time unless you are local and can go when it's not busy is just absurd. Worth it, but long wait! Also, often times the taco you ask for is not the taco you receive. I've had them mess something up almost every time. But I still go back very frequently because it's just THAT good. Also, happy hour is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been a Barrio - Lakewood fan for the past year but the food quality has decreased with each visit in the last couple of months.  Earlier this year, a waiter told my friend and me that they had hired a new chef so I'm not sure if that's been what's affecting the quality lately.  On a positive note, the staff always is friendly, the vibe is awesome, the prices are great (especially if you can hit taco happy hour), and the margaritas are awesome.  But on my most recent trip, both my friend and I were extremely unimpressed with our taco bowls.  We both ordered the fish of the day and it came out looking (and feeling) like a frozen fish stick.  We inquired with our waitress and she said the fish of the day was a filet.  The filet was freezing cold, as was everything else in the bowl.  My second bowl was made with chorizo and it was also extremely cold and very watery.  I've tried to give Barrio the benefit of the doubt because I love the vibe and concept of creating your own tacos/bowls but the food quality over the past several visits just doesn't justify any more visits."}
{"text":"This is honestly my favorite place to eat! Their tofu taco is phenomenal. The ingredients taste so fresh, and the salsas and sauces really spice it up. Happy hour is from 4-7 and 9-11 and features $1 off tacos (tacos are usually $3 and specialty tacos are $4) and 1/2 off margaritas. It's in the bar area only though."}
{"text":"Amazing taco's with SO MANY VEGAN OPTIONS, suits everyone! Fast service and tacos start at $3. Usually a 30 minute minimum wait, but always worth it. Highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"Super delicious tacos. Very authentic. It was pretty crowded but they managed to serve us quickly."}
{"text":"Stopped by quite late for a few drinks and tacos.  I was very pleasantly surprised with everything, the tacos came out super fast and they were absolutely delicious, definitely a place to remember."}
{"text":"Had 3 different specialty tacos and only liked 1 of them. Next time I'll just make my own tacos and for $3 that's a bargain. Drinks were great. Great prices all around. Awesome patio scene and just an all round solid place just to have a quick bite and drinks. Great service as well."}
{"text":"This place rocks. $3 tacos and the meats are tremendous. A few margaritas to wash it down"}
{"text":"Just a quick update - I returned to Barrio, heeding my own advice about ordering the double to avoid the rocks charge. Well, I was charged $2.00 for the double and $1.00 for the rocks. Still, the drink prices are reasonable and $3.00 isn't an unreasonable surcharge for a double with ice."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Barrio last night, and we came away very impressed with the place. The decor, atmosphere and food was terrific.   The service, not so much. They made my girlfriend's margarita (mango, it was delicious), but apparently forgot to make my drink. Eventually the drink arrived, and our waitress handled it well and took it off my bill. The place was crowded - maybe they should add a staff person or two to handle the volume?  But back to the food. FOUR WORDS - Habanero Mango BBQ Sauce. Put it on your taco. We had braised beef, pulled chicken and chorizo tacos, all of them excellent. I won't go into all of the different toppings, sauces and salsas you can choose from, but there's a host of flavors you can add to your taco so it's easy to find something you'll know you like.   The prices are very reasonable too. 3 bucks per taco, regardless of what you put on it. And they have good liquor on hand for as low as $4 a drink. No bottom shelf stuff at all. Even if my drink wasn't comped, we would have left there with a $30 tab - that's with 4 tacos, guacamole, salsa and two drinks."}
{"text":"A nice touch to the Cleveland Heights area, just a stones throw away from downtown Cleveland aka 15 minutes. Located next to the Fairmount Inn and across the street from BW3, it is located on the south western roundabout side. FYI, it is best to park in the back unless you can parallel park in the front, you make the call.  Like the other locations, the food is delectable and fits all cravings alike, especially the Coca Cola steak. For the first time, I tried the trio consisting of the guacamole, salsa verde and queso dip, which were superb. To say nothing was left would be an understatement.  The ambiance and atmosphere are very relaxed and chilled, which is fabulous for all alike to join. Come earlier or plan on waiting in a very congested holding area, which is directly in front of the doors...not fun. The hostess and host were surprisingly not very hospitable, which gave me a bad taste prior to being seated, which made me place this in the bottom two of the four locations. The service and food did help shake this shock, but come on.   Remember, you can always place a to-go order in, which took 12 minutes to get back, pretty decent for a Thursday night. Also, soon enough the patio will be opening and holding 15-20 tables; cheers to that and patio season.  So, create your own taco, grab a one of a kind margarita and enjoy."}
{"text":"Barrio, you are the best! I cannot ever get enough of their queso and salsa, it is amazing. The build your own taco concept is fabulous and I have been to all of their locations bust must say, kuddos to the downtown Cleveland location! You never let me down with your timely service, attention to the accuracy of my orders, succulent and mouth watering margaritas and an experience that always leaves me wanting to come back. If you want Mexican, get here now."}
{"text":"Second time dining at the Tremont location and was disappointed by the lack of service and attention to our experience.  I have dined at the other locations and love them, but not tonight. The spicy chicken tacos, with salads verse, were scrumptious, along with the pineapple and jalapeño margaritas. Love the build your own taco concept! Both waiters were asked several times for water and salsa, but did not bring either in a timely manner. The atmosphere and decorations are very chill, great place to hang out and watch a game or catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town and you get to pick exactly what you want. They have so many options including hard, soft and combo ones with cheese and guacamole in between. I really like the vegetarian options like black bean and mushroom.  They also give you free chips and dip."}
{"text":"My only complaint is that they aren't open every day. I get it - it's hard to make a lot of money on $3 tacos when people aren't ordering drinks, but this place is amazing. I love everything, but especially the veggie tacos options. I also got mango guacamole and it was divine. Service is a bit slow and good sometimes takes too long, but they are great about giving out chips and dip, which are both great."}
{"text":"Love it, always so busy, definitely needs more space and seating, but it's the best tacos in town, no contest!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place! Their create a Taco menu is awesome, I love the Coca-Cola steak. I don't live near by, but it's worth the trip to come out here!! 5*****"}
{"text":"Food is good but the wait is always crazy. Staff is always overwhelmed, just go to Bomba. Food truck only takes cash which is annoying and sketchy. Lots of vegan and veg options and great drink menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Barrio three times and I have to say it is one of the rockiest relationships I've had with a restaurant, ever.   The first date was fantastic. I loved the look and feel, the food was wonderful, the service attentive and friendly. \"This is it!\" I thought, expecting the best as any hopeful lover of a good taco would. I knew I would be back and I immediately began to tell my friends about my find that seemed so promising. I wasted no time planning the second date and was happy when it came to fruition, but to my horror I was exposed to a completely different side of Barrio.  To say I had a bad experience there the second time would be an understatement. I don't know what else could have gone wrong outside of the building collapsing. I called ahead to find out about their Happy Hour and was informed it would be going on when I got there. Seated out on their wonderful patio it was not long before we were approached but I assure you this was the only thing that went right. Our food came out incorrect and cold yet the server was no where to be found so we decided to eat our food as is (no problem as the incorrect combos were a-okay). Having ordered more due to Happy Hour pricing it became difficult to enjoy due to the fact that we were never brought water and when we asked for some (before our food came out, not by our server). Eventually we spotted him and were able to hydrate. At this point we were close to the end of our meal, and then the end of our water, and then... we were just sitting there waiting for someone to bring us our check, ask us if we needed anything else, kick us out?? Anything!? After a giant centipede landed on our table from the umbrella, we just had to get up and search for the guy-- but that didn't even prove to be easy. With the owners help we finally pinned him down. Our check was brought to us, we quickly just handed our card to him so he wouldn't disappear again and of course that was a bad move because we were overcharged which we found out while filling out the tip. After waiting we realized we might as well cut our losses and just pay the incorrect amount and get out.  Safe to say I was disappointed, my initial love of Barrio had been diminished to confusion, yet being a glutton for punishment I said yes to a third date. This one? Well the service was lacking but the food was correct as was the bill. I realized at this point that I might be slipping into a mediocre love affair where I try to make excuses to make the place seem better than it actually is.   Please Barrio, for the sake of your delicious tacos and awesome patio, please let me love you forever!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars because I LOVE the one in Tremont so much, but this one...such a disappointment. The food was subpar along with the rude service. I felt like they practically pushed us out. If you want the authentic barrio experience make the trip out to Tremont. It's so much more worth it."}
{"text":"Very disrespectful employees. They pronounced my name as \"orange juice\" but it is pronounced \"Or-on-jew-say.\" I am appalled by the insincerity of the workers. Who in their right mind names their child orange juice? I would appreciate if they at least asked for the proper pronunciation... I am... disgusted. Good food though."}
{"text":"Blood orange margarita, on the rocks, salted rim... All the margs are great and go down way too smoothly! And the queso dip is to die for. Good food, low prices, and great staff! What more could you want?"}
{"text":"I don't know how anyone could not love Barrio. The DIY taco menu gives you the control to create delicious tacos. I've been here 3 times in the past three weeks because I cannot get enough!!! The atmosphere is casual and I have yet to be there when it wasn't somewhat busy. It seems like a local/after work crowd especially late night (after midnight).   I would bump it up to five stars but the service is a little sub-par and slow. Also, sometimes the margaritas taste too much like the mix. They do have great happy hours!   Okay, back to the DELICIOUS tacos:  I have tried the chicken, chorizo, pulled pork, and beef. I have put together some not-so-great combinations but overall they ingredients are so good that whatever you put together tastes good. I recommend getting a specialty shell, they are a dollar more, but tacos are only $3 each which makes the extra dollar well worth it. The Green Goddess is marvelous as well as the Stoner(?) shell (the one with chorizo). My best combination thus far is the Stoner shell, with pulled pork, red cabbage, jicama slaw, and the ghost pepper sauce. It was so good I wanted to eat three more!   They do have a menu of recommended combinations. Some of them are pretty basic and some don't really sound good. None look good enough for me to try."}
{"text":"Holy moly guacamoly! I adore this place. Everything from the decor, to the service, to the food...have you seen the prices!?! If you haven't been here yet, get with the program and try this place.  Upon getting a great table on their patio, we ordered drinks. I had the Skinny Skeleton which was amazing in my opinion. I don't like sweet drinks or high caloric drinks so this was perfect. It was very light and just refreshing. For dinner, I always get the Green Goddess taco with the pulled pork and a bunch of other nonsense on there. These things are HUGE for only 4$.   Our service was great, our drinks were amazing and the food was mouthwatering."}
{"text":"Mexican romance!   Where do I begin...the atmosphere, the drinks, the queso or the tacos!?  Such a great place to stop in after work or on a night out, very casual and just very trendy. The tacos are about 3$ each and customizable to your liking. The guac selection and the queso selection are to die for. I mean you can have queso with chorizo!!   Great place for the wallet and the belly."}
{"text":"We came to this location for an early dinner on a Friday. Our server was quick and polite. I had the special chorizo meatball taco, which was amazing. It was spicy, but not overly so. Perfection. My other was a pulled pork with veggies...kind of boring. It was petty good. I also got the coffee with assorted cream and liquor drink, which was delicious and was happy hour priced!   Overall, a good experience. It's not my first and won't be my last visit."}
{"text":"Barrio is good food. We know this. This was my first time to the downtown location though, and it was a five star experience. It was May 2, and the first game of the second round of the playoffs for the Cavs. My friends and I were running very late, but had our hearts set on tacos. The place was packed as one would expect. We filled out our taco sheets while our table was being set. (regarding said taco sheets: I am normally not. fan of build my own anything. You're a professional chef, you build it for me. However, with tacos, my tastes are fairly basic. I love that I can opt out of fancy salsas and such.  Nonetheless, we ordered everything right away. Our waiter was polite and lightening fast. Our orders were all perfect, and we had time to eat! No tacos while running down the street! Thank you Barrio!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Tremont location, but this was my first visit to the Lakewood location. I definitely saw a difference in the quality of the tacos. I ordered three for takeout:  Dirty Taco -No complaints with taste or quantity of fillings.  The All Inclusive -The chicken was very dry.  Build Your Own -flour soft -chorizo -queso fresco -jicama slaw* -corn salsa with peppers* -chipotle honey**  *There wasn't enough slaw or salsa on this taco.  **The chipotle honey sauce is really, really good.  Overall, I was disappointed. I couldn't finish the \"All Inclusive\". The chicken was so very dry. Additionally, all three tacos were COLD! I had to nuke them in the microwave for a few seconds.  I will visit the Lakewood location again and update my review. Maybe they were just having a bad day as it sounds like service is major problem for them, but most folks like the food."}
{"text":"My brothers and I came to this location at 1:10 am, fifty min before closing. We were STARVING and praying that they were still taking food orders--luckily they were! Our server, Andrew, was amazing! You would have never known the establishment was closing in 50min. He took care of us as if the time constraint was not a factor. He was extremely polite, attentive, and happy to assist us. We really appreciated it! I will ALWAYS come back to Barrio and would recommend Andrew to anyone who eats there!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to have lunch on our day off and we ended up here  man was that a great choice. I love how I can build my own taco my server was great .   My only problem is I went for a second time cause I thought my son would love it but our sever was completely rude.  Rushing us to take our order and if we wasn't ready he would leave . I ended that stay and just left"}
{"text":"I have been to all other locations and have been served consistently good tacos and margaritas. No complaints here for extended wait times as I have worked in a restaurant and understand that it happens. Great location with similar decor to other barrio restaurants. Two complaints with my first visit to this location. Our waitress did not write down our drink orders and 2 of the 3 drinks ordered were brought out incorrect. We ordered 2 specialty margaritas (incorrect) and the other drink was a corona. She gladly had the drinks remade but not  without 15-20 minute delay. Hoping that if that happens in the future they can be remade quickly since we waited originally. Second compliant is that my hard shell taco was over fried to the point where I just ate the filling and left the shell behind. Didn't want to send my food back too an look like a jerk in front of my co-workers significant other that I just met. Also, her green goddess taco shell had an over fried hard shell that she ate around. Hoping that all the kinks of new restaurant are worked out because we are very excited to have a Barrio close to our job!"}
{"text":"Love barrio and so excited they are open on this side of town.   But I have eaten at this location three times. Each time multiple parts of my order has been wrong. I am not sure if this is growing pains or if this will be constant.   Also the gauc is not fresh which is such a disappointment.   I hope that the willoughby location gets up to the level of the other three. I was so excited for their opening."}
{"text":"There is an awesome waitress here with gauges and a shaved head. I always LOVE having her as my server. Kills it every time.  Food was pretty good- got a chicken and waffles taco but there wasn't any waffle in it? Must have been an accident."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to go here after a stressful work week- and this was a great choice for just that. The atmosphere is very casual, with the decor being equally awesome. The walls are painted \"day of the dead\" style and add to the hipster vibe. We started the night off with a margarita pitcher for the 3 of us- definitely enough for 2 glasses for each of us. The margaritas are not strong at all, if anything, they tasted watered down, so inevitably we had to order another one! The tacos were delicious. We also got a tres amigos to share- the queso of the day was collectively our favorite of the three- I can't remember the exact ingredients, but I do remember it contained balsamic vinaigrette. Oh so yummy. We each got a few tacos, and between the three of us, I think we got at least one of each on the menu. We may have overdone it, as we couldn't finish all of them. I would recommend starting with 2 and ordering more if you still have room, as they do come out very fast. Also, word of caution to those going to Barrio on a date- these tacos are very messy. Very heavy on the sauce, thus my napkin usage was out of control. Thank goodness they appear to use recycled paper napkins :)"}
{"text":"Endless chips and salsa, great margs, and fantastic tacos. I love Barrio.   Sometimes I'm not convinced I'll be able to eat all of the tacos I got because of the four bowls of chips I've already eaten, but they are so damn tasty... I'm not so great at making decisions, so I usually end up getting three different special tacos. You can build your own, but in my opinion, nothing I've put together has been as good as the chef-made list. I try to get a different one every time, and I've enjoyed them all so far. You're probably thinking that three tacos isn't much, but they manage to pack quite a bit of grub into the shells. The \"stoner shells\" (soft taco, cheese, and then a hard taco) make already stuffed tacos even beefier. The brunch menu is also great. I had some French toast dish that was so decadent.   The place gets crazy busy during after-work hours, so time your visit appropriately. Parking can also suck. All street parking.   I'm not sure about happy hours. I'll be back here for straight up tacos and day of the week."}
{"text":"Went there last friday night before a concert we were attending at the Q. The decor was very funky with day of the dead themed decor that jived perfectly with the Barrio Mexican theme. It was very very packed, but it was a friday with rain pouring away on us!! We gave them our info for a table, but managed to squeak in a seat at the bar that we shared til another stool was available. The bartender ignored us for a solid 15 mins...we ordered the al la carte tacos & rice...delish except my rice was ice cold! The ingredients were über fresh & chock full o flavor!! Obviously you pick what YOU want on the tacos, so if it isn't good...you suck at picking toppings lol. We never were given our salsa & chips, which left us very disappointed!     They allowed too many people to crowd the bar area...literally we were butt cheek to9 buttcheek with strangers, and had 2 rows of ppl crowded in behind us ordering from the bar...we non stop had people reaching over us, and hovering as we tried to eat & drink....very uncomfortable!!  I really don't think they should allow all these walk ins to just huddle around the bar area like its standing room only, they should have had to wait til the tables are ready or barstools available!     We for sure will be going back, just not on a busy night & time! The Cleveland Heights location had rude staff, so we won't go back to that one, but this one at the Arcade & Tremont one are fab!!"}
{"text":"You need this in your life. Try the coca-cola marinated steak."}
{"text":"My go to taco place downtown. I'm obsessed. Literally loved single food choice I have made."}
{"text":"Stopped by Barrio for lunch with the wife. Prior to our visit, I had only tasted Barrio tacos out of their food truck. Since I love tacos, this place was high on my 'to try' list. We were promptly seated and our tattooed waitress took our drink orders. We shared a pitcher of sangria, which we both loved, and some chips and salsa.  First, I ordered a build-your-own chicken taco on a Green Goddess tortilla. I topped it with tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and salsa verde.  Then I ordered two additional tacos from the menu, the El Jefe and the El Puerco. A little while later, the tacos were delivered. They were larger than I expected and I knew I probably would have a hard time finishing all three, plus chips and salsa.  I ate my custom built taco first and it wasn't very good. Actually, it was cold and bad. It was very watery from the veggies and it was gushing onto my other tacos. The cold salsa verde was my least favorite topping. It really lacked flavor and had weird texture. I was really disappointed with my taco. However, the other two were actually very tasty. So if you don't know the flavors, go with a taco from the menu!  I would give these tacos props for being big, filling, and of great quality, but they're definitely not the best tasting tacos I've eaten. I want to stop back and try some more just to be sure though.  Service was very good and the atmosphere was very nice in an old house. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Downtown Cleveland I have eaten at Barrio more than any other restaurant in the area. The combination of their excellent tacos, friendly and attentive staff and the sophisticated slacker vibe makes this place irresistible. The build-your-own (BYO) taco option makes each visit unique and delicious. However, be careful to not overdo it with you BYO taco creativity. I have found that that the KISS (keep-it-simple-stupid) method is sometimes the best. I really like their \"flour soft + corn hard\" tortillas and the Coca-Cola Marinated Steak (extra $1) are my favorite combinations. As far as toppings go, this is where more is less in my opinion. KISS. Seriously. You won't regret. The more you pile on, the more you take away from the taco as a whole. And my one and only complaint about this place is that the toppings can sometimes come out ice-cold. Sure, these toppings should be \"cold\" (i.e. shredded cheese, lettuce, onion, tomato, etc..) but when they are \"ice-cold\" it creates an unusual and undesirable effect on the palate. This is hardly an issue, hence all 5 stars in the rating. Trust me, I'll be back...often...too often? Love this place and I always take my out-of-town guests here."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, this location is better than the one in Tremont!   Service, food, and atmosphere are all on point. I don't think you can get better than this for the price -- UNLESS this location had a patio. 4 1/2 stars until then.  I recommend getting the taco as a bowl and loading it up with all the veggies, black beans, and lots of the sauces (definitely the secret sauce!)"}
{"text":"Their service has definitely worked out their earlier kinks! I'm excited to see the downtown Barrio."}
{"text":"As somebody who loves all types of tacos, Barrio just improved their flavor by far after their new menu change. From what I had, everything was delicious.   Barrio is simple - you have the option to make your own tacos or create your own. I am very picky when it comes to what I want, so I always make my own, and I get the same thing every time because it works. Prices per taco vary from $3-5 per taco, depending on what all you get on it, and what extras.   First, the most important, the margs. I do not like margaritas but I love barrios. I either get frozen mango or peach, and they are the perfect mix of tequila and flavor. Then secondly, the queso - the best thing every moment of every day. It's smooth and silky, and melt in your mouth good. I can't comment on the guacamole since I don't like but that's another story. They also give you free chips and salsa. Also very good.   If this was the old menu, I would by far say get the Coca-Cola marinated beef, but after trying their new brisket, I hands down have to say get their brisket. The flavor is smoky, sweet, and over all good flavor. Their Coca-Cola marinated beef is also amazing, but my new favorite is the brisket (and it's not an up-charge)! I also had the ground sirloin and I was not a fan. It didn't have enough sweetness to it. It would need something sweet.   My fillings are always the same - flour taco, cheddar cheese, corn salsa, chipotle cream, slaw, and barrio secret sauce  Another thing they added were these cute boxes for you to take your tacos home in - they used to only give bags and foil, but now they give boxes. They are perfectly tall enough to fit a taco standing up which is very good.   Okay - now the bad. Their service is either a hit or miss, which is why I could not give them a full 5 stars. There have been plenty of times that i have had to talk to managers multiple times to have to get our server switched in the middle of our meal. I cannot stand bad service, and I don't think I've had outstanding service once at barrio. Our sever today wasn't amazing, but she was attentive!   Solid 3.75/5 - I'll round up to 4/5."}
{"text":"If you don't do anything else, get some drinks at Barrio! I had the Marigold and Margarita Perfecta and they were both pretty stellar.  As far as the tacos, I thought they were just ok.  Prices are pretty fair with the build your own taco starting out at $3, any extras will cost you, but not much. BUT their sides are super tiny, they literally come in a cup that you'd out condiments in at a hot dog stand."}
{"text":"First time eating inside. Didnt know it was that small and busy...LoL Ordered a pitcher of the Mango Margarita and it was the bomb. *think the bartenders wrist is broken* She is the Winner!!  Tried the Chicken and Waffle taco. Didnt taste bad, but the greens were really bitter. Built 2 taco bowls and they were quite tasty.  Will be back when the patio is open!!"}
{"text":"Went to Barrio last night for the first after many people had recommended. It was amazing!  The \"build your own taco\" was fun (and slightly overwhelming). The margaritas were outstanding!!!  And for everything we ate and drank .... The bill was pretty cheap!!  We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I love Barrio and have been visiting the other locations for years. I was so excited when I found out that they were opening one closer to me!  The meal as always was excellent. I always build my own taco(s) and change it up every time I'm in. These tacos are bigger than most so I'm usually full after two. I'm a sucker for the frozen pear margarita and the stoner queso.  This new location is huge so I didn't even have to wait to be seated - huge crowds shouldn't be an issue!"}
{"text":"Seriously amazing tacos + margs. I love the \"create your own taco\" concept and the two I ordered ended up being delicious. The pineapple salsa was wonderful as was the cilantro sauce. As for the margaritas, I'm convinced all of the flavors are worth trying. I went with blueberry as I figured if any of them were going to be wacky, this would be the one. It was fantastic! Service was speedy, even for a Friday night. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Love love love barrio! How could you go wrong with cheap, delicious tacos, free chips and salsa, and amazing margaritas?  The service is always quick and friendly, you can pick all your taco toppings and salsas, and did I mention free chips and salsa? The salsa has a nice little kick to it. I'm sure it helps them sell drinks, but I'm not mad about it.   Always a great standby, and I love the funky decor and lighting. A Lakewood favorite for sure!"}
{"text":"How exciting to have another great Barrio location. It's large and bright and the service was quick. Same cheap prices and great tacos as we're used to from the Tremont and Lakewood locations."}
{"text":"Still love barrio. They even have a brunch option now during the weekends. Bloody Mary's are very tasty. Good news is if you dont like anything on their brunch menu you can still get regular Barrio taco's. This month's taco of the month \" It's a spicy meatball \" probably the best taco ever with chorizo meatballs there's no way you could go wrong. If you have never been to Barrio you're missing out."}
{"text":"Food was very good, servers were nice, and it had a fun vibe in a city like Cleveland. Especially around game time it is the best place to be. Would I say family friendly? no, definitely not. Along with that they've got some other issues, weird system of ordering food which had no explanation and why no menus? Other than that all is okay."}
{"text":"I feel like I am the only one in Cleveland who is not crazy about Barrio. I think the tacos are below average- meat is usually dry, the tacos are soaked in whatever sauce or salsa you choose.   Pros: Hip atmosphere, great margaritas (they are pretty fantastic), good queso and salsa  Cons: Service- Every Barrio I have been to the staff seems stuck up and rude. The tacos are over priced and bland and no matter what, I always end up waiting at least 45 minutes for a table.   Yes, I understand that there are so many options to choose from. I just feel like Barrio is trying to make a taco into something its not."}
{"text":"Goodness...I used to get take-out from this place almost every week for months, but recently the food seems to have gone down hill.  During my last visit my tacos had been carelessly thrown together with too much of each requested ingredient slopped and piled up within my taco. To top it all off..my meat was ICE COLD.  It was so disgusting that I immediately threw it all away.   The time before that my take-out just seemed like they were PILING the ingredients in there...like MORE of everything was supposed to make me happy. Just because I checked off cabbage doesn't mean that I want a pile of cabbage in my damn taco. The flavors were comparable to someone dumping a cup of horseradish into a taco when it only required a teaspoon. JUST BAD.  Seriously only writing this review because I hope whoevers messing things up in the kitchen gets a training session =/"}
{"text":"Best place to be ever. Best white tacos. Free open mic Monday's are hilarious haha  the media she is like 22'ish so if you're older than that you might feel a lil weird"}
{"text":"Best place for white style tacos. Free open mike on Monday's!!! Real cool place to be. A little expensive but it's all right from time to time."}
{"text":"Make your own tacos - creative and inexpensive!  The tacos are only $3 each and there are million options to choose from the content to cheese, sauce, etc. They are also decently big so well worth the money! I also really liked their margaritas and I would strongly suggest that!  It is a busy place tho so be prepared to wait in line for a very long time. The patio outside is also a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"Um, I'm pretty confused by Barrio. As someone new to the area, I received many recommendations to check it out so I walked in with high expectations that surely were not met.   I went on a Friday evening so it was quite lively but we were able to get seated inside pretty quickly. Nothing noteworthy about the ambiance and the crowd definitely leans toward a younger, hipster-esque crowd. The person I was with kept commenting on how it was hard to tell who was an employee and who was a patron. Indeed a tad disconcerting and also makes it difficult to know who to ask for service.  As for the food? Of the 5 tacos we ordered, 1.5 were enjoyable. One we left untouched, one was delicious, and the others were decent but nothing to write home about. The guacamole, however, was great.   My margarita was surprisingly strong; I don't fancy myself a lightweight so either the bartender was feeling generous or it is simply well worth the price tag.   I reckon I'll give it another try but with much lower expectations next time."}
{"text":"Big thumbs up to the build your own and the Jeffe's selection. The margarita pitcher is worth the 24 dollars!!!! The Coca Cola steak and the mango habanero sauce get a cheer from my palate as does the guacamole. Noms. I'll be back to create more tacomazing."}
{"text":"My girlfriend was super excited when I told her that I would take her up Barrio for an early Mother's Day dinner, as it is one of her favorite spots around Cleveland to go out to. I've been to this location a handful of times and I also have been to the Tremont location as well. I like the setups in both locations; Tremont in the summer for the better outdoor seating and I would prefer the bigger Lakewood location in the colder months due to having more room. We live on the west side so we decided Lakewood's location fit in our time frame better that day.   We arrived on Saturday at around 4:30 under the impression that there was a happy hour ($1 off drafts and tacos and half off margaritas). While sitting in the \"Day of the Dead\" themed restaurant we were informed that the happy hour was only during Mon-Fri, which was a bit disappointing but not really that big of a deal. Our waitress came by and asked us if we knew how everything worked, which we did. At Barrio you order your tacos off of a \"build your own taco\" sheet that is on the table.   We started with the complimentary chips and salsa and ordered the pineapple guacamole. The salsa is more of puree salsa with a little heat and is more my style (I prefer a more watery/puree salsa to a chopped tomato salsa). While the guacamole is definitely a star at Barrio and as much as I love the queso (which at Barrio is awesome), my better half doesn't so we opted for the pineapple guacamole which was cool, sweet from the pineapple and chipotle honey and a little savory with pickled red onion.  While we were enjoying our appetizer we asked the waitress to bring a pitcher of the passion fruit guava margaritas (my girlfriend's favorite) to enjoy. After about 10 minutes of waiting our waitress came back and took our taco sheets and stated that they were out of guava, so we went with Strawberry. I'll admit the first margarita went down great but after 1 I didn't really care for anymore but for a $28 pitcher, we mustered down most of it.   The problem with this particular visit that we waited 55 minutes for a 4 taco (2 for the each of us) order. We didn't receive any update on where our food was or any idea of how long it would take, which I thought was a bit rude. Our server was mainly non-existent after she gave us water refills and by the time all that time had gone by we both weren't really that hungry. Also to mention it was an extremely hot day and the margaritas and heat may have left us a little dehydrated. We each ate one of our tacos each and they just tasted ok. The stoner shell (basically queso and chorizo between a hard and soft shell) I had lacked pretty much any cheese or meat at all and the tacos were drenched in sauces. I did enjoy the Coca-Cola marinated steak, which I had never seen on the menu before.   To be honest, this may have been the worst experience I have had on a Barrio visit. I've had some great experiences at Barrio previously and although our server was lousy, the food took forever to come out, at least the guacamole is good. I would definitely come back (maybe I'll go to the Tremont location next time) but sometimes you just get a server on the wrong day, which we experienced that day. I expect better service and better tacos next time or I'll be looking for a new Mexican spot to hit in the future."}
{"text":"I have a mild obsession with this place. I highly recommend the guac, white queso and blood orange margarita (by the pitcher). Worth every penny and happy hour is key! But just know if you show up for happy hour you have to sit at the bar or a high top table. Which means you can't get happy hour prices at the low top tables. Don't be sad when you see your bill."}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight! We were understanding of it being busy considering the fact that we went in around dinner time. The waitress barely checked in on us and my mom asked for more salsa which she never went and got, but we saw her talking with someone. The food literally was taking over an hour to come out and we were literally watching people that came in wayyy after us leave before us and we still hadn't gotten our food. She told us a 20 minute ticket time which turned into over an hour. Oh and not to mention we waited to be seated for over 45 minutes. I'm very disappointed and upset tonight because I love Barrio and I was looking forward to it, but us having to wait so long made me lose my appetite. We actually ended up leaving because she kept telling us that the food would be out, but we were only waiting longer and longer. I really hope that my next experience isn't this upsetting."}
{"text":"Greatest tacos ever- and very worth the price, $3 tacos which are a good size proportion and fun atmosphere. The drinks are also strong and unique! We go here as often as we can."}
{"text":"I came twice and the margaritas sucked the same both times.  As the signature drink, you'd think they would have googled a good recipe.    The food was pretty good both times, although the first time was right after they opened and they no longer have that menu.  They are definitely taking the a la carte/happy dog approach of simplicity, however it's kinda hard to decipher the different sauces and quesos.    It's an awesome patio, of course, but I was a bit turned off by my server.  I had the same one both times, and he mixed up the drink orders both times.  Which is totally fine, I've served a lot, and messed up a lot.  But own up to it and fix the problem.  He tried telling us that all 5 of us were wrong and he was right.  It was odd behavior for a person working for our tip.  I think that is why I 2-starred this place.    I might go back again in hopes of a more pleasant experience, but certainly won't be ordering the margarita on the rocks."}
{"text":"GARBO- I went with my friend to this place a few nights ago. He had been by it before and said it looked interesting from the outside,  bikes in the window. We knew it was a hipster joint by decor. but, was starving and was in the mood for something new to us. I did like a few things about the inside right when I came in and I also hated alot. looked like an employee drew something on the chalk board,  well whoever that was probably should of painted their tacky walls too. . It's not original. They could make the inside much better with a spot like that. Heard the place before it was real laid out. Hmm..wish that was still around.  And now food,  service was actually pretty good the server was honest as I believe to his actual opinion. But he probably likes bland food.  Looks like the menu chef tried too hard to be different like over-did it on being 'creative' could of really lightened up on the 'what's trendy' aspect. We shared a Tuscan guacamole it's nasty.  Too much toppings that didn't mix well and guacamole itself looked like it came from a package even thought it was probably made right in back. Chips greasy. Tacos not good.  Not going back and don't recommend.  I know good food and this place is a wanna be."}
{"text":"Came here during the evening and it was quite crowded. Wanted to sit at the bar, but was told it was reserved. I always thought a bar was 'first come, first serve'. Also the happy hour deals are only for bar patrons, as told by my server.   They were quite busy so it took a while for our tacos to come by. I ordered the Spicy Sapanaro and a braised beef taco. They were quite a handful and bursting with flavor. I really enjoyed them, but I think I prefer the tacos at La Plaza Supermarket or Las Dos Fronteras. Overall it was good, but not my kind of tacos."}
{"text":"The service is always great. But I have been coming here for years and I get the exact same thing. The past several times I've been here my orders have been completely wrong. Tonight, somehow my boyfriend and I both got some crazy hot sauce that I know we definitely didn't order. Which is specifically why I am finally writing a review. Not carelessly mess up not only one order, but two, in the exact same terrible way is truly unacceptable. I don't know what this sauce was but I am not a fan of very hot foods so I assure you I did not order it. I didn't finish my food, have had tons of water and such since and my mouth is still on fire and my stomach has never felt more queezy. Unfortunately, I think this was my last trip to Barrio."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time Sunday evening.  I was blown away - the chips were super fresh and had just the right amount of salt.  The salsa was PERFECTLY spicy.  I needed help ordering, the fill-it-out-yourself slips have tiny print and it was dark inside - but the result was fantastic.  Best tacos I've ever eaten - and this comes from someone who voted for another taco place in the recent \"Best Tacos\" contest.  I'm afraid I made a pig of myself, not leaving even a smidge of chipotle crema on the taco wrapper.  :) The food was so good I forgot to take pictures but I certainly will the next time I visit.  Well worth the drive from CANTON!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them negative stars I would. I've been a supervisor for customer care at a retail establishment for 10 years and have never been treated so badly. I was called names, never asked if I wanted anything, talked obscenities about at the bar to the point that I couldn't hear!!!! Went up and requested service, told me to get a bartender that I never saw. DO NOT GO here"}
{"text":"Skip the appetizers and go straight for the tacos! We all ordered different variations of the steak tacos and they were amazing! The ingredients are fresh and there are so many topping options that it took us some time to decide. The guacamole, cheese dip, as well as rice and bean sides were all average. Good, but nothing we haven't had elsewhere. The beer selection is extensive. Too bad they don't offer a beer flight because we would have liked to try several but once we finally chose one, we really enjoyed it! The waitstaff is attentive and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. If you're in downtown Cleveland, the Barrio is a great option!"}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour and grabbing some $2 tacos! They are delicious and so worth the wait.  You can pick from a huge variety of toppings to put in them and you really can't go wrong! The margaritas are good as well however, you definitely need to go with one in the rocks rather than frozen.  The frozen one just tastes like ice...no alcohol what so ever."}
{"text":"I wanted to love Barrio, but it wasn't to be. The walls are uniquely and brightly hand painted with skeletons.  The bar is small and was crowded by 6:30 PM on a Friday night, but bar service was quick, bartenders friendly and margaritas were quite good.  My beer-drinking husband was surprised that the beer was served in a mason jar; I liked it with the margaritas, but agree not a good fit with beer.  I love tacos, but was surprised that that is all they serve--no burritos, quesadillas etc. and no fish.  The guacamole was very good and the appetizer portion at $6 was enough for 4.    Two of us had the build your own tacos and 1 ordered off the very limited taco menu. Once we finally got a table service was quick. We did find the food to be good and fresh. I didn't mind filling out the order sheets, but my 2 companions didn't like it.  We each had two tacos.  Though the side dishes are small, with the guacamole appetizer, we were all quite full, so the $33 cost for food seemed quite reasonable.   We really didn't like the plastic spork that came with each meal - rather than being trendy and cute, I found it cheap, tacky and wasteful. Though we liked the food and atmosphere, at the end, all 3 of us agreed not worth the 20 minute drive + 45 minute table wait."}
{"text":"This is my favorite store out of all the locations. Always great customer service the drinks come out there's always someone around for a refill it doesn't have to be \"your\" waiter and the food is always hot and tasty. Barrio is by far my favorite restaurant in Cleveland!!!"}
{"text":"I like the tacos, LOVE the chips and salsa, and their margaritas are overpriced but adequate (I grew up in Houston and have high expectations of margaritas in that price point). For a while, this was a good, solid restaurant for me that I would go to frequently.  However, the wait times have been UN.REAL. lately. I've gone there multiple times and been given an estimated 2+ hour wait time. Sometimes I've tried to stick it out for relatively shorter wait times (still at least 45 minutes) and have sometimes snagged a bar seat or just given up. I'm sure I'll still go for a meal during off hours, but expect a significant wait if you're going around an actual meal time."}
{"text":"Great place to eat on ocasion the wait is disorganized but the food is always consistant. The drink variety and drink specials they can do better but they make up for it with the food. Food prices are great."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location I have ate many times at the one in Lakewood totally delicious! This seems like the fun location to me I didn't drink but the inside of this place screams let's party . We sat in the bar area , it is a little crowded but when you get your chips Queso and Salsa you forget all about it . If you have never ate at Barrio there is a sheet with the Taco types of shell , protein , toppings etc. You use the pencil and check your selection in the boxes . The service is great here we had a Waitress named Alise very attentive waitress ! The parking is street parking we parked around the corner. It was a Monday and place was jammed packed, tells you how good it is thanks for the great meal Barrio!"}
{"text":"Barrio is one of my favorite places to eat at in Cleveland. They have great food, great atmosphere, and great drinks. I would recommend coming here if you are looking to eat some yummy tacos."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in Barrio. We went there on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm. The restaurant wasn't very busy and we were seated immediately. The service from that point on was subpar. It took a few minutes for anybody to come over and that was the theme for the rest of lunch. Our waitress acted as though the place was packed and she was the only server in the restaurant. (Which she wasn't) When she did take our order it was rushed and she offered no help to others in our party who had never experienced how Barrio worked. The salsas were average, queso was average. I ordered the spicy chicken with my taco as well as the French toast from the brunch menu. The spicy chicken was dry and burnt and bland. The French toast was very good and really the only reason this place got 2 stars. The rest of the service stunk.  I've been to a similar style restaurant in Columbus and that place blows away Barrio.  Needless to say, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"One of the only places to eat late night on a Sunday downtown. The food was decent, although somethings were very spicy and others weren't without the appropriate markings. Since it is a late night spot there were several rowdy tables around. On our walk back to the hotel there were also several people on the street that approached us for money, which makes me nervous in a city that I am unfamiliar with. Service was good, though!i"}
{"text":"No other words to describe Barrio except freaking awesome! My boyfriend is from Cleveland so we often come up and visit family. I think we have been to Barrio on every trip since we've been together. It is a family favorite and just a great place. Relaxed environment with always friendly staff, great drinks, great special quesos, and the food is awesome. You'll have fun creating your own masterpiece of a taco. Wish I had one where I lived but it's always something we look forward to on visits. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time the other day with my son who was home from college.  I liked the choices of taco toppings, especially the cilantro aioli.  We ordered lime margaritas, which were great, not too sweet.  My son liked the food also.  I took away a star because the service was slow.  But still...I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here last week, and I flipped for the delish chips and salsa. The tacos were good...but cold. The tacos are cold at the Lakewood location, too. Odd."}
{"text":"We love Barrio, it's one of our favorite go-to spots. LOVE the braised beef. Queso is a must. And if you like sweet and spicy, and are a little adventurous, the jalepeño Margarita with a cayenne sugar and rim is one of my favorite drinks. Also, amazing and inclusive gluten-free options, my mother with celiac disease loves having so many delicious options to choose from"}
{"text":"I'm not a tequila kind of person (undergrad is over), yet I fell  for Barrio's specialty margaritas.  Fresh juices, nice blends of flavors.  No neon green stuff, no slushies! Himself got a margarita with a splash of soda, which was really refreshing.   Their table salsa is really good, more of a smooth blended picante sauce than a really chunky mess with hunks o' raw onion.  It's a little spicy and a little smoky .  Don't fill up on chips and salsa, though.  Get some quac.  We had the special of the dia (*snort* Spanglish)  Ours had bacon, goat cheese and pickled corn.  The underlying guac was solid and the toppings were extraordinary.  The tacos are a fantastic deal-- $3 each.  You order them by checking off options on a list, Happy Dog style.  They also have a taco of the dia, which is worth trying because it has some creative toppings not available on the menu.  I had a pork belly with apple jicima slaw, pork rinds and some secret sauce.  It was so good.  I also made my own pulled pork taco combination.  Two tacos plus the chips and quac did it for me in terms of dinner.  NB, \"caliente\" is not that awfully hot.  If you like spicy you may want to try the \"muy caliente\" options.  Add to that the Dia de los Muertos murals on the wall and the equally decorated waitstaff (two tattoo minimum), good service and very reasonable prices, and you've got an awesome  place for a casual, fun meal."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Great yummy make-your-own tacos (get the green goddess shell)!! Chips and sauce were ok, drinks could be stronger. Cool environment. Wish I could rate this 4.5 stars!  Long review: Great experience! So I'll preface this by saying I'm vegetarian and from Texas, the land of Tex-Mex and awesome Mexican food. I've been to Barrio twice now--both times to the Tremont location, and was equally impressed each visit.   My friend and I went based on Yelp reviews and the wait was not long at all (Sat, early dinner). The waiter was super friendly and helpful. We each ordered our tacos by filling in our 'scantron' order sheets (you can make your own taco or choose one from the menu). We munched on some chips and sauce while we waited. The chips and sauce were ok. Tacos were awesome. I ordered one with a green goddess shell (hard/soft with guac and queso) and black beans and the other was a soft flour taco with the Thai chili tofu. The green goddess shell is awesome! My friend ordered 2 tacos and loved them also.   My second visit was a Sat night with a friend visiting from out of town. It was packed. We waited about an hour and a half, but we hung out at the bar (which was packed also) in the meantime. I got a house margarita which was ok, and then a Marigold (cazadores reposado, cointreau, limeade, strawberry-pear puree, blood orange wedge) at the recommendation of our server. Seemed like the drinks needed more alcohol. But they were good. My buddy really liked his tacos. Service was great and I will go back!"}
{"text":"I hardly ever review restaurants but this time I must. Went to Barrio last night for the first time. It was the worst service I've had at a restaurant in ages. We met friends there around 7:10 and were told the wait would be 20 minutes. There were six in our party. Granted the place was packed and it was Saturday night but we waited almost an hour. During that time we got drinks from the bar. I wanted red sangria but they only had white. It was peach flavored and was poured from a plastic pitcher into a jelly jar. No pieces of fruit at all. I didn't even finish it. We got so hungry waiting we finally asked for a basket of chips from the bar.   At last we were seated outside. The patio is really nice and it was good to escape the noise of the restaurant so I started to feel more optimistic about the place. That didn't last long, as we sat and were ignored for at least 20 minutes outside. No one came by to take drink orders. In fact I hardly saw any wait staff at all. It looked like no one was working. Every table around us had people with empty glasses. The few employees we saw seemed to be in no rush.   In desperation we flagged down a guy who acted completely surprised when we said no one had come to take our orders. We asked who our waiter was and he actually said well, I guess that would be me! It was bizarre. We asked for several baskets of chips to tide us over (the baskets are tiny red plastic ones like you put hotdogs in at a picnic, unlike the bigger bowls most Mexican restaurants use). He took our orders and disappeared. More waiting. Our hunger grew. We had now been there over an hour and a half without even ordering food!  I decided to get up and go inside to get some service. I flagged down a waiter who was nice and made some excuse about our waiter having not realized out table had been cleared and reseated or something. He said don't worry, I'll take care of you at the end. Finally our dinner orders were taken and we ate. The tacos were great but it's just like eating from the food truck. No utensils except a plastic spork. No dishes, just plastic baskets, foil and paper wrappings. Our bill was pretty low. They definitely took something off.   I left feeling full but have no plans to return. Hubby thought they were just having an off night but to me, the place seemed horribly run, understaffed and not focused at all on customer service. And it's not as if the waiters have a difficult job! All they do is collect tickets with people's taco selections and turn them in. Someone else delivers the food to the tables. That's it! The food was delicious and fortunately we had fun with our friends, otherwise this would be a 1-star review."}
{"text":"This place was still so busy at 10PM on St Patrick's days, of all days.  But even for being so busy the service was still great. The chips and and salsa were endless, I could not stop. Did a couple make my own tacos and a Dirty Taco. Both amazing and an excellent size for a great price. This will definitely be a regular spot when we visit."}
{"text":"Went there with 8 people from work. 5 people ate food...3 did not. Just the 5 people who ate food including myself very sick  after. A week later 3 of my friends went there for dinner and they all got sick after. Sent email to them and got no resonse. Need I say more."}
{"text":"Barrio is awesome. The drinks are good, and the food is great. It's also easy not to spend a fortune as long as you don't get drinks. I've walked out of there with a total of $14 (without the tip) for two excellent, filling tacos + guacamole, so that's definitely a plus. Let me leave you with the following advice: Do NOT overload the tacos! The first time I went to Barrio I was so excited at the whole build-your-own-taco thing, and the fact that they have soooo many cool ingredients that I totally messed up my taco and there were too many flavors. Just keep it simple and use one delicious sauce at a time. P.S. the pickled red cabbage and the coca-cola marinated steak are delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"We weren't sure about this place before we tried it, but since it is always busy we figured there must be something to it.    Yes, INDEED!  Best tacos in town, hands down.  I recommend building your own, but they have recipe ones as well if you are lazy.  Don't bother with the coke marinated steak - not worth it.  Personally I go with the pork.  Definitely try the guacs and queso dips - they are great.  My wife begs me to go out to eat here all the time.  We had friends visit for a weekend and they wound up eating there twice in two days.  Come early to beat the rush."}
{"text":"Food was very good, gave it a 4 stars d/t hostess. Interesting options for design your own tacos. My husband loved the concept of filling out a form and just handing it to the waitress. I had a crispy bacon taco with pineapple salsa and a cilantro like sauce. We were at the Tremont location and parking was very limited. We ended up on the street in the adjacent neighborhood. Small inside dining area with a patio.  It was lunchtime on a Friday and we had a bit of a wait which had to be done outside due to size of the place. The hostess was not very friendly and didn't seem to know what was going on.  However, our waitress was excellent.j"}
{"text":"So I just went back to Barrio because I still love them even after receiving cold tacos on my last visit and not receiving a discount or anything. My food came out hot this time, yay! I ordered a fried green tomatoes taco without the lamb sausage or goat cheese. It tasted great, but I only got one tiny fried green tomato on it. It didn't even fill up the tortilla it came in. The menu clearly says \"tomatoes\", plural, so what gives? Plus, I opted out of two toppings that come with it so you'd think whoever was making it would have at least thrown another tomato on there. I didn't say anything about it to the staff because I don't want to be THAT person, but come on, man! And it still cost $5 because it's the taco of the month. I'm sorry, but that was not worth $5. You're breaking my heart, Barrio."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing. The chips and salsa are amazing and keep magically appearing on the table. The beer choices are extensive and delicious. You can bring your dog to the patio and share your tacos. The staff all seem very nice and efficient, no matter how hipster-y they are. The prices are great for the full belly you receive. I wish there was a Barrio closer to me so I could gain three hundred pounds faster."}
{"text":"Got 2 build your own tacos and the service was great and really fast. and it's fun to mix and match tacos"}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food with a fun, quirky atmosphere. We frequently come to Barrio when we are craving queso and tacos. The margaritas come in a variety of delicious flavors, my favorite of which is the mango marg with a sugar rim. Highly recommend the Bombshell taco shell (hard shell inside a soft shell with bacon and queso)!"}
{"text":"I would like to preface this review in saying that my girlfriend and I traditionally frequent the Lakewood Barrio. We go, on average, once every week or two and grab a couple tacos / margs at the bar. Up until last night, I've not had any significant complaints regarding service or food at any Barrio location, as it is typically fairly consistent and delicious. However, after my experience at the Tremont location last night- I may no longer be a customer at these restaurants.   My girlfriend and I arrived around 10 PM, and opted to sit in the dining room due to the bar being crowded with patrons watching the Cavs game. The host was nice and our server was attentive and friendly, delivering our drinks and food quickly. Both my girlfriend and I agreed that the tacos seemed subpar to our usual standard at the other location. On my second of two tacos, there was an off taste to the red cabbage and the remainder of the taco in general was kind of funky, so I decided against finishing it.   The remainder of last night into this morning, my stomach felt very queasy and off. No pain or further issues until this evening when I started feeling nauseous, which I didn't think much of as I am on a strict liquid diet today for a medical procedure I am having done tomorrow.   Unfortunately, my nausea got the best of me and I ended up vomiting up both the contents of last night's tacos AND the entire finger-length of what I can only assume is a plastic food prep glove.  Not only was this very shocking, it was absolutely one of the most disgusting experiences I have ever had following dining out in Cleveland. As someone who frequents as many local restaurants as possible, it was super disappointing to be on the receiving end of such an offensive kitchen mistake (and extremely dangerous health code violation) at one of the establishments I visit the most.   Also, when I contacted Tremont Barrio in hopes of speaking with a kitchen manager or someone who could better elucidate my concerns, the phone rang and rang with no one picking up for minutes. This whole ordeal has left me feeling very upset and sickened at the thought of Barrio's kitchen service and company in general."}
{"text":"I always love Barrio- the food lives up to the hype, the margaritas go down easy, and I love the menu. Tonight was exceptional. Tonight I tried the Willoughby location for the first time.   My friend ordered queso to share. Why have I never tried the queso??!!! What a fool. It was so good. We devoured it, but before our chips could even empty, our waitress brought us another basket.  I loved my shrimp taco with rice and lime cream sauce. And the green goddess tortilla is to die for!  Really the best part about our night was our waitress. She was really efficient and made everything so easy. She was laid back but friendly and I don't think we had to ask for a single thing. I wish I remembered her name, but she was awesome."}
{"text":"I wouldn't  go on a Friday or Saturday unless waiting 2 hours is your thing. But if you do get a table the food is fantastic!! I can't wait to go back, but on a less busy night. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Holy crap, the pulled pork was delicious. Stumbled across this place online. Decided to give it a try. Very good food, fun atmosphere, good drinks. Will be coming back if we come to Cleveland again."}
{"text":"I love Barrio. And this new location is just as good as the rest. The first couple weeks there was some long waits for chips and drinks but it was just because the new team was figuring everything out. I have been there over 6 times and have had a great time every time. Don't forget about takeout too!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Very good beer selection and the combinations of tacos are amazing"}
{"text":"Barrio secret taco sauce - can I bottle you, take you home, and put you on everything?  It is the perfect spice and so good on their tacos!  My go-to is chorizo, jicama strawberry slaw, tomatoes, mango salsa and the secret sauce.  It is very easy to make a terrible concoction - part of why I hate the whole build your own idea - so if you are unsure, pick one of their pre-set ideas or ask someone.    Lots of tequila and whiskey options.  For the price, it's hard to find a tastier place."}
{"text":"We ordered three different kinds of guacamole - all were delicious, but I loved the Pineapple and Tuscan the best. Chips were pretty good, warm and tasted homemade.   I also tried two margaritas  - mango with Espolon tequila and the Marigold (with strawberry puree). Both were delicious, fresh and refreshing.   It was very busy last night, so service was a bit slow, but nothing major.   Negative -  So sweaty. Omg, it was super hot last night, but waaaay hotter inside actual bar. Terrible. Total sweaty beast in this place wearing jeans. I was getting so uncomfortable as there was no AC (why was it not on??), or even some darn ceiling fans. Not sure if this is always the experience during warmer months or just a glitch."}
{"text":"Went here for drinks. Got the red wine sangria - very good and strong. Love the chips/salsa. Tried the veggie special queso dip, which was great.   Fairly busy last night on patio, but not super packed. Service was pretty slow towards the end of visit (by like 11:30), we were waiting to get check and then receipts to sign for a long time. Server was nice, but I think this is another place that seems understaffed."}
{"text":"I love tacos..i love..margaritas and love spicy hot sauce. I have been to the location in Gateway but it was saturday night in downtown and was very busy. We decided to give this location a try and i m very glad that we did. Stopped here around 10pm and the bar was not packed but the patio was since it was a very nice day. The wait was around 10 mins so we waited at the bar to grab a beer before we got seated. The beers come in little mason jar which are so refreshing to drink out of. The patio is very nice. Soon as you sit they come out with chips and salsa. The menu is a list where you get to mark and pick and choose as you please. They also do have specials that are listed on their special menu. I always try their guacamole and one of my favorite hot sauce is the ghost pepper sauce which is not only spicy but very flavorful. The chips and salsa and their pineapple guacamole is very tasty. I love all their tacos and as well as their bowls since you are able to choose. I like this place very much and would eat here every weekend if i could!"}
{"text":"I love BARRIO! I love the atmosphere, i love the friendly bartenders, i love the decor, i love how you can build your own tacos and they have amazing hot sauces! I have been to all the different locations from tremont, lakewood to cleveland heights but I like this location the best. The concept of barrio is plain and simple. You come in sit at the high tables, bar or just at a regular table. The server will ask you what you would like to drink which they have list of beers, margaritas and tequilas to choose from. Usually after the drinks they come out with chips and salsa. You can also get their traditional guacamole or their speciality guacamole of the month. If they don't have the special menu on the table you could simply ask the server for one. I am fan of their complimentary chips and salsa! The chips always comes out warm and the salsa is the best salsas I have ever had!  I usually get mine with side of their hottest sauce ! I have had their many specialities guacamoles but i prefer the traditional one the best!  The traditional guacamole has a ton of flavor to it. I have had their margaritas before but I feel as though they don't give the money worth. Usually I stick to the beer with my meal. The concept of barrio is build your own tacos. You can choose from soft corn to hard corn to bowls or their version of tortilla. Then you can you choose the protein, then cheese, then toppings, salsa, and sauces. If you don't want to build your taco they also have a taco suggestions and also their special taco of the month! I like to build my own taco and bowl! The price isn't expensive, the tacos are very good and has a lot of flavor and the service is always good and fun! I enjoy this location a lot and will come back again!"}
{"text":"Cleveland is CUCKOO for tacos and I blame Barrio. Started with a green bean casserole queso (yes you heard me right!) WOW Then I had the double layer shell soft taco with hard taco and beans in between and the most delicious marinated steak. TO DIE FOR Great ambience. Good beer selection. A must if you're hungry in Tremont."}
{"text":"The Lakewood Barrio is by far the best. The queso is omg amazing, but it's runny at other locations! It's always JAM PACKED, so be prepared to wait for a tables. Great happy hour with half off margs and $1 off tacos during the week in the bar area! The passion fruit marg is the best thing ever, but they claim it's always \"seasonal\". There is really something for everyone to eat here. My entire family ate here and EVERYONE loved it, including a 6th grader, college girls, a vegetarian, and 87 year olds. So personal and differentiated that it's impossible to not like it!  Tip: I've never once used my real name. It makes ordering more fun. One time, my family all did Mario characters :p"}
{"text":"This is not your abuela's style of Mexican cooking- think super trendy and bursting with modern flavors. You don't come here to mess around with any sides, so get 2-3 custom tacos to fill your belly. Treat yourself to a mango margarita and load your tortillas with the stuff of dreams- guacamole, pineapple slaw, fresh shrimp, fried tofu, jicama, corn salsa, cilantro crema, etc. You can't go wrong with build your own tacos."}
{"text":"Good idea, terrible execution. The service was awful -- we waited 45 minutes to get a table (even though we were quoted 15) and then another 45 min to get our food after we ordered. My meal was at room temperature; clearly, it had been sitting out for awhile. One taco was great (hence the two stars; get the Greek goddess shell); the other was too salty to finish. We had to ask for water multiple times before it arrived and our queso and guacamole never showed up. The blood orange margarita was decent, but nothing to write home about.   The decor was cool and it had a great vibe. Waiting 90 minutes to get half of my order at room temperature, though? Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I went to Barrio for the first time with a coworker and her friends on Friday the 13. The first server we had was flat out rude. I questioned why the chips were pink,never being there before I did not know. She informed me that as soon as my party would be quiet she would answer my question. Then she disappeared and a young man came over ,he was pleasant. I mentioned what she said and a few minutes later she approached us to confront me about my issue with  her bad attitude. How unprofessional.  The tacos were soggy and not even worth trying to eat. We spoke with a manager who blamed the sauce for the whole shell being soggy.  You get hard tacos for a reason.We could not get new tacos made and it was an all around disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The salsa is addicting. Chips are freshly made. We got the build your own tacos and had fun mixing up the toppings. The march special was Reuben nachos which were really good and enough to share. We had the peach margaritas and it was light and refreshing. The staff www very nice. Will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"I've only been in Cleveland for about 9 months but I would have to say this is probably me and my fiancée's favorite place to eat so far. The restaurant has the right balance of hip and casual appeal for when you just want to be out. A restaurant that definitely draws in the younger crowd. Been to this location once and the Tremont location also once- here, we had very good customer service. Our waitress was exceptional. The downsides of Barrio are the wait times (you'll likely wait much longer relative to other places), parking (busy times can force you to attempt neighborhood parking), and that's about it.   The prices are right at this restaurant. You can't beat a Taco that taste this good for only a few bucks. Their highlights are their tastes (I love that pesto sauce!!!!), very customizable taco combinations, and customer service (at least in our experience)."}
{"text":"I must start by saying that I have been an avid Barrio customer. The last few years, especially summers, I would be here at least once a week; and anytime my friends from out of town would come, I'd take them here because they couldn't wait to come back. The service is usual fine, giving the high popularity and associated longer wait times. However, I give a 3 Star review today because of the menu change. The chicken, which has always been the most amazing part for me has been tweaked to be of a lesser degree in my opinion. My enjoyed Widow shell is gone, replaced with a redundant stoner shell with bacon. The chili spiced sirloin was fine, but still not as good as the sirloin. My girlfriend LOVED the shrimp tacos, however the shrimp flavor has also changed to a jalapeño version to which she is not amenable, and stated that the fish of the day taco was \"fine.\" As long time advocates and patrons of the Lakewood, Tremont, and downtown Barrios, this visit is the first that has not left us longing to come back when less full again. I plead, please bring back your old menu chicken and shrimp at the very least! And the opinion for plain chopped tomatoes return would be welcome as well."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for late night eats. You can't beat it. Prices are reasonable, the drink options are plentiful, the patio is splendid and, of course, the tacos are awesome. I usually order two, one of which will have the \"stoner\" shell. That with the endless chips and salsa and a cocktail, I leave very satisfied."}
{"text":"La Plaza still has the crown for best tacos. RIP to Mi Pueblo. Barrio are trendy tacos. I always order the tacos with everything checked off on the list so I end up eating half of it with a fork. That is about the only way they end up being worth $3 a piece. At that point, they can hardly be called tacos. The ghost pepper sauce has a nice level of heat. Barrio is a great place to come during the week after 9 pm. Margaritas are $4 during this time slot. The Marygold's margarita is terrific and worth coming for. The beer list is very good but probably a dollar or two too much on each. The best value would be the Lagunitas IPA bottle for $4.50. This section of Madison Ave in Lakewood is definitely on the rise. I am excited for the sushi and noodle place to open next summer a few storefronts down."}
{"text":"I like tacos and they sell some decent gourmet-ish ones. I have been there twice now and had a variety of options. I have almost stopped eating meat entirely so this time around I tried the fish and tofu. On my prior visit, I had beef, chicken and pork. I thought the beef was the best option. The spice is not too overwhelming. I enjoy my food very spicy and the ghost pepper sauce was not too crazy. The atmosphere is nice. I enjoy coming to places where I feel comfortable and in my \"element\". Usually this is a bar type setting. I appreciate that this is a bar that serves semi-healthy and fresh tasting food. My friend and I were driving around aimlessly yesterday and after about 20 miles of cruising we ended up here. The beer selection is pretty good. And now that I come to think of it, 806 was a terrible place. I think I only liked it because good things happened a couple times after going there. Barrio is a good addition to Tremont."}
{"text":"Hey barrio, your phone isn't working right FYI. We keep calling to put in a take out order and it won't right and goes straight to \"this customer has no voicemail.\" Please fix it so I can order tacos thanks."}
{"text":"Food was good quality. Small tacos for what you get. I forgot to get more tattoos and grow a beard before I went. Hipsters will love this place."}
{"text":"Yes, this is the Happy Dog of tacos. That means that the Barrio experience is 50% \"Let's go to a fun place and hang out,\" and 50% \"Let's get some food too.\" If the question was, \"Let's go get some great food,\" well then of course you wouldn't go to Happy Dog or Barrio. But as the name implies, Barrio is a neighborhood, fun type of place.  That said, it's less of a bar than Happy Dog. It's a noisy family kind of place. By all means, bring the kids. We went twice and have seen kids and babies both times.  Like Happy Dog, the menu is on a pad where you check off what you want. You can build your own taco or choose house combos. You choose what shell you want, you get one meat, and you can put as many sauces and toppings as you like.   Everything is pretty yummy, however, for me, the bland commercial, grocery store type tortillas detract from the yummy fillings and salsas. The Chipotle flour tortillas are better than these. Your best bet is probably a hard corn shell which is thin and seems to be fried onsite. It's greasy but it tastes good. You can order soft corn tortillas by crossing out \"hard\" and writing in \"soft.\" I was happy that they gave me 2 of them per taco, as I would expect of a taqueria. However, they weren't any good and they were clearly meant for deep frying. But at least they weren't greasy.  I ordered a side of pickled veggies. I had a problem with these too. They tasted more like Vietnamese picked cukes and carrots rather than mexican ones. I have no idea how the mexican ones are supposed to be made, but they did not at all taste like the mexican ones.  But as you might expect from a bar, the best part are the appetizers and drinks.We had the queso of the day, which had asparagus in it. THIS was AMAZING! I had a Chupacabra which has cazadores reposado, club soda, lime juice, fresh mint, serrano peppers, strawberries, cayenne + sugar rim. This was AWESOME!  I LOVED it!  So bottom line, I give this place a 4 as a bar, and I like this place better than Happy Dog because it's not dark inside, the cocktails are awesome and refreshing, the queso is amazing, and you can create something healthy to eat if you want. As a restaurant, I would give it a 3."}
{"text":"Service was good. But....... These are not tacos and I had thee worst margarita ever. When I asked the server if they maybe forgot to add the tequila he said \"ya we get that a lot but it's just the way it is\" uh ok? Cleveland has a lot of great restaurants this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Back in June some friends and I went to Barrio for dinner and drinks. Tacos and tequila, what can go wrong?!   Well, I was very disappointed by what happened after I sat down. I was one of the last in the party to arrive and it took the server 10 minutes to come and take my drink order. It wasn't a big deal as I as with my friends and having a great time socializing.   I ordered from the DIY Taco menu and was very excited that I'd get to create what I ate. I just knew it was going to be wonderful. Wrong. The meat was overcooked and chewy and the accompaniments did not go well together. This could have been blamed on myself because I did choose what to put on my tacos (I doubt it. However, everyone at the table felt the same way and they ordered their tacos straight off the menu. The drinks were overpriced and I had the worst guacamole I've ever had in my entire life. I tried to fix it, but it could not be saved.  The theme was cute and the spoon/fork utensils you get are worth instagramming, but other than that I hated everything about this place. For $45 a person I expected better service and better food. I won't be back to Barrio."}
{"text":"I've heard so many mixed things about Barrio, so I was hesitant to come here for a night out. I'm glad I decided to put on my big girl pants and ignore everyone else's opinion. The major complaint I've heard is that the tacos come out cold, but everything I ordered came out steaming-hot and fresh. Service was incredibly prompt, and my food was delivered before I stuffed myself full with chips and guac. I'm a fan of plain jane guacamole, but they had several interesting options to fit any palette.   I wound up building two tacos: one soft shelled pork with slaw and chihuahua, and one hard shelled braised beef with pineapple salsa. I have no complaints on the variety or degree of tastiness of the tacos. My only complaint is that the margaritas seem a tad on the sweeter side. It's partially my fault for ordering a fruity mango margarita, but I like that perfect mix of sweet and sour. Each margarita I tried (the mango, marigold, and diablo) seemed lacking on the sour side. Still, all of the drinks are refreshing and satisfying. You cannot beat the quality of food, variety, and attentive service for the price."}
{"text":"Quick Delicious with so many Vegetarian combinations unique to this area street taco like venue  The atmosphere is very chill & the Dia de los Muertos art is really dope I come here when I visit Ohio and it's always a good time  JXO"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in this part of the city I want to try new restaurants, but I always keep coming back to Barrio for the variety of options and great tacos. If you're on the fence about this place, know the tacos going in as everyone is different in taco preferences.   These tacos have a really awesome variety to build your own, but you have to look at the ingredients and make sure it's something you'll be on board with. You can definitely go a more traditional route with a corn or flour tortilla with spiced chicken, queso and pico, but there are so many incredible flavors beyond this. The sauces, for me, are the highlight. I usually grab 2-3 (because the appetizer salsa/dips are not to be missed) and switch up the proteins with a different sauce.   Pretty solid margaritas as well. Be ready for a long wait, especially at this location. The great news though is you can order a drink and hang out while waiting for your table. Beyond the margaritas they have a decent beer selection featuring some local breweries.   We've done brunch here a couple of times. The chicken and waffle as well as the french toast bowl. The french toast bowl was more of a dessert being pretty decadent but tasty. The chicken and waffles I could take or leave. It's not a regular brunch place for us, as we usually just do a build your own which is offered at any other time.   If you want to try a restaurant in this part of the city, make it a whole day event so you can work Barrio into the rotation for lunch or even a bite to eat late at night."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. But this trip was horrible and now we will never return. First of all it took 3 trips from the server to put our drink order in bc he would walk away as soon as we said one drink. Then after waiting 45 mins for our tacos, my wife left to go back to work. Then our food came and I asked for a manager. When I told the manage (Adam)what was going on he took our food off the table including taking the food out of my 6 yrs old and 4 yrs olds hands and telling me on Friday lunches it takes 40+ mins to get your food. FOR TACOS!!!!! Then handed me a bill for $12 for 4 drinks. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Will not return"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Marigold margarita is my favorite! The quest and guac are amazing! Build your own taco, can't go wrong with that and cheap!!"}
{"text":"Great build your own tacos!  A good place to stop at lunch on Friday's, after work for happy hour (half priced margs!), and for late night eats after a concert or game.   Dinner times on weekends tend to have waits but you can order drinks at the bar while you wait.   Some recommendation: -stoner queso - omg so tasty -stoner taco -Greek goddess taco -chorizo on anything -Coke cola marinated beef -new item - apple jicama slaw!! Tasty! -pickled peppers -blood orange margaritas  Also good gluten free options, low carb options, vegetarian options and paleo options. You can get corn tacos, flour tacos, bowls with and without rice and tofu/black bean/ portobello mushrooms for your protein if your a vegetarian or vegan."}
{"text":"Barrio is one of those places that all the under 35s in Cleveland talk about like it is the holy grail. I have tried and tried to fall in love with this place as much as my friends but I just can't seem to find something super great.   Their create your own taco menu is pretty cool, but the tacos themselves seem pretty bland to me. Their guac didn't quite live up to the hype but it was ok.  The best thing that I have found at Barrio is the atmosphere and their chips. People and servers are always upbeat and the place is always pretty busy with casual diners. The tortilla chips have a good combo of toasted, crunchy and salty."}
{"text":"Never lets me down. It's a choose your own adventure of tacos. Always fresh ingredients, amazing drink selection, and the strangest staff you'll find (that's a compliment). This is an absolute must if you visit Cleveland!!! I don't give out five stars, but they earn it EVERY time we go."}
{"text":"This place is always good quality food for the price.  Duck airfield are great and usually the service is outstanding.  Will definitely continue to go back."}
{"text":"The noon hour on Friday was packed for lunch. While both sides of the restaurant and the patio were full I found it a bit unreasonable that the host tried putting 5 people at a square 4 top table. Lunch ended up taking an hour and a half.   The server was attentive and kept the water and chip baskets filled. The salsa is really good (free) as it the guac ($). It's hard to resist not making a meal out of chips and dips.   I tried two tacos off their pre-designed menu. I liked them both. The Dirty Taco was more basic with just rice and black beans, but the \"dirty sauce\" was nice and spicy. Another, the El Puerco, was double wrapped in both a hard and soft shell with cheese between them. There was a good serving of pulled pork inside and the chipotle honey sauce didn't make it too sweet.   I then designed two of my own and didn't do too terrible of a job. The braised beef, red cabbage and apple jicama slaw go well together."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. One of my favorite spots in CLE. Only thing I complain is about always an hour wait. But if you want the best you have to wait and be patient"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I wish the service was faster. The only reason I gave this 4 star is because of the amount of time we had to wait to get the food. Other than that good crowd, lots of locals and out of town people since it is in the vicinity of lot of hotels in Cleveland downtown."}
{"text":"We had lunch here based on numerous recommendations and were not disappointed.  They had 3 menus available (brunch, tacos, and create your own tacos). The table is served chips and salsa as a starter.  I ordered a soft shell taco with pork, white cheese, corn salsa, rice, and an individual order of guacamole.  The food came out in short order and tasted great.  The taco base price was $3 plus $1 for rice and $2 for guacamole.  I would recommend this place for a quick lunch at a good price."}
{"text":"What can I say about Barrio that hasn't been said before? If I die tomorrow, please serve barrio at my funeral. It is THAT good. I love building my own tacos, and the best part is that you can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Everything is cooked and prepared to perfection. I wish I could buy their chorizo by the pound. Make sure you try the \"stoner\" shell option, it changed my life."}
{"text":"Fun build your own taco joint! Tons of different options and combinations as well as good chips, salsa, queso and guacamole!"}
{"text":"Saturday May 9th 2015 after 1:00PM, place had a crowd, but the three of us were lucky and got seated quickly.  I was kind of stressed and tired after attending our son's college graduation at nine in the morning.  I wish I had felt better, but I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  I ordered the El Hangover  rice, black beans, bacon, goat cheese scrambled eggs, queso fresco, dirty taco sauce  .    1 Chili pepper, but sauce is spicy, not too I enjoy a kick. Taco size is ample, 1 was enough for me.     They were kind of busy in the kitchen due to a large party, so wait time was a little longer.  The service was good, price super reasonable, food tasty and ample.     I would visit again and maybe not on a busy time !!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try Barrio's restaurant this past weekend - I have previously had Barrio's tacos both from their food truck and their stand at Progressive Field, which I've always loved. Unfortunately I just didn't feel like the food at the restaurant itself lived up to the same standards.  The restaurant is very hip; I especially like the eclectic skeleton murals on the walls. We were fortunate to be here during the month of October, so the whole restaurant was decorated for Day of the Dead and was very festive. We had to wait a little bit to be seated, but the staff seemed to be efficient with a quick turnaround time for a table.  When we sat down, we were greeted with warm chips and salsa and then ordered a round of drinks. Honestly, my biggest disappointment of the evening was my margarita: it tasted like it was poured straight out of a pre-mixed José Cuervo bottle. It was so sweet that I almost couldn't finish it. I know it seems insane to have the margarita be such a disappointment to me, but I've had some absolutely amazing margaritas from taco joints recently (I'm looking at you, Bakersfield!), so I guess I was expecting the same from Barrio.   Anyone who knows me knows that I consider tacos a food group in itself. After being wowed with the tacos from Barrio's food trucks and the stand at Progressive, I expected a lot. I decided to build my own - there are order sheets on every table for you to fill in your own preferences and then hand your order off to your waiter. I loved the concept of this, and the build-your-own tacos were only $3 each, which is definitely a steal! I ordered two tacos. The first included grilled chicken, pineapple salsa, and chihuahua cheese (plus tons of veggies), and the second had Coca Cola marinated steak, honey chipotle sauce, queso fresco, and veggies. The steak taco was definitely my favorite; I liked the taste of the Coca Cola marinated steak much more than the grilled chicken, which didn't have much flavor. Neither one of the tacos seemed remarkable to me. They were piled high with veggies and didn't have much meat in them at all.  For now I'll stick to Barrio's food truck or their stand at Progressive, where for some reason the tacos seem much more impressive and flavorful."}
{"text":"So I actually did not take photo of the food. Unfortunately this review is not in favor of the food the customer service and atmosphere was pretty excellent.  The best thing I did eat was the elote corn dip... That's about it.  The tacos were terrible, I didn't want to be rude so I actually put the food in a napkin and could not eat it. I believe I had the marinated Coca Cola meat... The taste was terrible, the toppings are not traditional in the context of flavor. This restaurant goes off the that path for sure. If that's something your into this is up your alley. For me, I like my tacos to taste like tacos. My server actually made me a second serving because she noticed I hardly touched them, so she made an adjustment from flour to corn and again, it was not very good food. Customer service was really courteous and polite. The restaurant is got a really dope vibe. If I ever was to go back it would be for beer and chips and that elote dip."}
{"text":"I love Tremont so when they opened a Barrio in Lakewood I was all WTF! There's no way anything cool can be transported from Tremont to Lakewood. With that said this place is in Lakewood so it's not as good as the Tremont location.  Actually, It's awesome to have a place open late and serve delicious food in Lakewood. The menu is good and building a custom taco is fun. I had no trouble getting in. Parking was easy and the staff was helpful. I have never been to the Tremont location so I apparently don't know what I'm missing."}
{"text":"Popped in as a recommendation from a bartender at another bar.  It was Monday night so we weren't expecting much, but we ended up having pretty good time. The beer was cold, they have Jameson and a tequila on draft and they serve tacos late. What more could you ask for, I mean seriously...  I ordered some of the portobello tacos from the paper fill in the blank ordering form, and after some chips and great salsa, they arrived. They were the \"chefs special\" and man, they were fantastic. Flavorful, a good size, juicy and delicious. The bartenders were friendly, the other patrons were too, it was just a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"This is a really cool looking place inside the restraunt! I liked how you can build your own taco's.  This is a good Mexican restaurant that Matt and I found on our way to subway tonight (we ate here instead). Barrio Restraunt in Cedar Fairmount Circle."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get tacos around Cleveland. The restaurant offers a make your own taco option, which I highly recommend. The starting cost for one taco is $3, but depending on some of the ingredients you choose the cost may increase. If you are making your own taco I would recommend the stoner shell, you will not be disappointed. The restaurant also provides salsa and chips for free to each table. Overall, this is a really great place to eat and during the summer it is really nice to sit out on the patio."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance!! Love the food!! Any combination of ingredients results in a great taste. The collection of cocktails is pretty good. My family loves this place so much we went 3 times in one week. Food is cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"I was super excited to find a Taco place that did build your own tacos. We came in on a Friday for lunch and sat at the bar. The restaurant was super packed. The bartenders were quick and attentive - we were thrilled to see that there was Patron on tap! I was disappointed to find out that there were no traditional soft corn tortillas. I ordered the Coca-Cola marinated steak and a Fish taco, my boyfriend got a Chicken Taco and a Shrimp Taco. The steak was delicious, I was not impressed with the fish taco. I ordered it with cabbage on top (traditional way it's served) - the cabbage was super watery which made the fish really watery. The fish was also cold. Boyfriends shrimp taco was AMAZING.   I would return and give some other food a try if I am ever back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service!! We live an hour & a half from Cleveland & came to the city for some good drinks & food & were very disappointed in the service. Our bartender neglected us, one of my friends waited 20 minutes for a drink! Mind you, it was extremely slow. We asked for waters & our bartender completely ignored our request & just walked into the kitchen & didn't come back out for a good 10 minutes. He yelled \"last call!\" & we asked for 2 more drinks & he said \"no\" & that we could only order shots for last call. This was a Friday night as well. We also wanted to put in just 1 more taco order 10 minutes prior to closing & they said no to that as well! The worst service I've ever received, I'm a server as well, I'm not nitpicking. It's a shame, the food was great but they lost 4 good customers & gained terrible reviews for future customers coming to Cleveland for some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Love the the concept of being able to build your own tacos. The options are endless! The pulled pork and coca cola steak are delicious. I highly recommend getting the stoner shell (hard & soft taco shell with queso and chorizo in between). If you do not want to build your own tacos they also have a few house selections and usually have a special going on as well. The margaritas are also delicious. They have a wide variety to choose from. Their happy hour is also a pretty sweet deal, $3 rita and $2 dollar tacos. The atmosphere is also pretty chill. The place does get packed so best to get there early. Def one of my favorite places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Sam was a great bartender! Super pleasant and kept us around for another beverage when we would have otherwise left! Spicy margs are to die for!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, tacos...well, just don't get the soft corn tortillas. Rough as paper. Salsa and guac are thr best thing of the place in my opinion."}
{"text":"Good  to that the Olivor Twist location (BTW one of our favorite places) has been open with Barrio!  This well known #CLE eatery finally has made it to the East.  So,  time for a stop in.   Stopped in after a movie (The Post,  must see!) around 6:45 and faced a wait of 45-60 mins,  which didn't bother us.  Got closer to the bar for drinks and moved to a spot to wait. Got our table in about 50 minutes which wasn't  a big deal.  Settled in and placed our orders.   The variety of the selections all hit the spit.  Not one complaint!  Also the guacamole and chips appetizer was top notch.  Fresh warm chips that keep on coming hit the spot. Overall a great follow up to a good evening.   Then why only 4?  Noise!  I'm not the #GetOffTheGrass old guy,  but never thought I would leave a place and join the rest of the crew say its so good to hear again. Sure Sat night,  but the noise level was totally unexpected.  Hopefully it was due to a pleasant evening to get out and celebrate another new addition to D'Town Willoughby. So,  be forewarned place can get VERY loud!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food tastes soo good and the service is unbelievable. If youre ever looking for an affordable meal at a late night, this is the place to go to"}
{"text":"The only taco place I recommend to anyone coming to Cleveland in hopes of finding good Mexican tacos! The customization of the tacos allows every person to get to try something that they like! The salsa that is served is also incredible and I always get the stoner queso each time I'm there! As if the food choices weren't good enough, the margaritas there are phenomenal! Most locations provide good happy hours- but are a little funny about some of the rules on where you have to be seated so be careful of that before going in!"}

Sometimes the wait times can be around an hour (or exceed that) which isn't ideal- but for how great the tacos are, it is understandable!"}
{"text":"Was there around 12:30am few nights ago with friends and wife.... Wife had a super hard time ordering (she never managed to, finally got ahold of server to complain about having waited 20 minutes just to get her attention to order), same deal with me. Managed to get the guacamole and chips--guac seemed store bought. Never managed to order tacos but with horrible service like that, why ever risk going back? After the first encounter with my wife, the server clearly ignored us the rest of the night as she breezed back and forth in front of us."}
{"text":"Very busy for brunch with a 25 minute wait. That's ok with me as that's a sign of a good restaurant. As a recent transplant from Los Angeles, I've noticed that service needs help. While standing at the bar for 10 minutes, no one greeted me or gave any eye contact. I understand your busy but a smile and an I'll be right with you goes a long way. Really excited to get a good margarita and  was disappointed with the flat mix. Having said that, the tacos were fresh and options are endless. Our server was on point, friendly and knowledgeable. I'll give it another go."}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Cleveland! We stopped in this place for some lunch and it was easily the highlight of our trip! We started with the Chorizo Queso which was a huge portion and came out quickly. It was a delicious way to start the meal. The tacos were very creative and I took the waitress's recommendation and ordered two of the El Jefe tacos. They came in a \"stoner shell\" which was a hard shell wrapped inside a soft shell and held together with queso and chorizo. Amazing! The corn salsa and chipotle honey sauce brought everything together. Best taco I've had, possibly ever!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  On Professor Ave, the main drag for Tremont, a little historic neighborhood (drive around and check it out).  Lots of great people.  What all Hipsters should be like, stylish, fun, friendly and cool (take note Royal Oak MI.  You're too f#cking uptight, pretentious and Fratboy douchie).  Good drinks, cool atmosphere, good music, nice patio, good service, good food.  The \"create your own taco\" menu is fun and I like the wall of hot sauces"}
{"text":"Highly reccomend you go here during happy hour for half off delicious margaritas. Get Norah to make you a chupacabra and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome location, fun atmosphere, POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I've used this as a place this past year to want to take friends or family visiting me in Cleveland but couldn't have been more embarrassed this last time. When we went in and put our name in, the hostess looked on her chart and told for us to follow her. As she acknowledged us as we start to follow her and again acknowledged after she seats us, we are then told by a server when we are getting ready to order drinks that we weren't allowed to just go and sit down on our own. Short hostess with calf tattoos had us follow her and then said our server would be with us... So our group walking in and \"sitting on our own\" was not the case. Knowing she made a mistake and accidentally sat my group of visitors in front of other people, the hostess did what she felt was right... She lied to her boss and claimed that we cut in line rather than admit to an honest mistake.  We would have had zero issue waiting in line after the mistake, but making us look like assholes because of a hostess not paying attention was very frustrating.  I have not been back in 3 months, but will still go to their other locations. As stated, great food and fun atmosphere, but the numerous errors in customer service over my times here and the hostess lying to a supervisor claiming that we were in the wrong is a deciding factor that will make me choose other options down this busy strip.  Our group was not some bunch of drunk assholes either as you may be assuming, we simply just did as we were told and followed the hostess. Silly in perspective, but it was very embarrassing getting stared/glared at when we were doing as told.  We put our names in and they said it would be an hour (8 tables open and 2 groups standing in line at this point), and we did not receive a call back.  The new Buffalo Wild Wings does not have this quality of nachos, but they did just fine even with an inexperienced staff.  Honesty and Integrity leave a lasting image, and if a simple mistake could not have been resolved... Do they really give a shit about you, or do they just know you're in downtown CLE so take it or leave it?"}
{"text":"Food was great and the staff quick and courteous. Even with 7 ppl everyone was taken care of quite well."}
{"text":"This place was really fun. I came here for a date night with my girlfriend and we had a pretty decent time. The food was awesome, the drinks were pretty good too!   I'm reserving one star because they have a very loud atmosphere there. It was hard to hold a conversation. Which would have been fine if we were at the bar, but we were at the dining room.   I definitely want to come back again, hopefully it won't be as noisy."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the margaritas and the tacos are awesome.   Wish they had a place in Solon/Chagrin Falls area."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times. Staff is nice- food prices are reasonable. Parking is a disaster and I feel like every time  I come here there's a wait- regardless of the day of the time. I do fall into the category of thinking barrio is a tad overrated. Although the food is good, and the margaritas are good- I just can't get into the hype."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, Barrio is my favorite Cleveland eatery. I have had consistently great experiences every time I come and I bring all my visitors because I don't think you should leave Cleveland without trying it. The trendy vibe and great service are surpassed only by the delicious tacos that will blow your socks off. My go to is the 'El Jefe' which has a delicious combination of sweet corn and smoky cheddar. They're pretty big, so two is plenty. The jalapeno margarita, the quesos and the guacamoles are all really good.   You can't go wrong with anything on this menu! Note that there is almost always a pretty long wait to get seated!"}
{"text":"Nice, clean place! You have the ability to create your own tacos, which is really neat! Ingredients were great, shrimp in my taco was grilled really well, and their hottest sauce was really topped my taco off! Additionally their queso was scrumptious! Service was excellent to add to my already enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Check your receipts!!! They have charged my card incorrectly TWICE. Called the manager and they said they are aware of their \"situation.\" We love their food but the extra charges on my card here are too sketchy."}
{"text":"Nicest Mexican ghetto ever. I normally steer clear of Lakewood nowadays. I like Barrio in Tremont, so I had to check this place out. I gotta say, I like the fact that they kept the same theme. The flying Nazi skeletons on bikes hanging from the ceiling are there to let you know you are at the Lakewood Mexican Ghetto.   Honestly, I do like this establishment, their tacos are very affordable, good size and taste AWESOME. Check the walls around you, this place comes equipped with racks full of assorted hot sauces. Check it out."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday.  I've also visted the Tremont location and their food truck around town a few times.    Be prepared to wait for a table.  When we arrived on a Friday night at the Tremont location at 5:30 PM we had a 45 minute wait.  We decided to go to lunch in Lakewood a little bit past the lunch hour.  Arrived on Friday at 1:30 PM.  We still waited for a table about 40 minutes with a 30 minute quoted wait time.  People were still waiting for a table when we left around 3:00.  I'm guessing this place is just always on a wait.  Since neither location has a decent waiting area they would be a great restaurant candidate for the Nowait app.  Once seated we are promptly greeted.  Our servers at both locations were very attentive and did a solid job.  It's easy to see why they are always so busy.  House made chips arrive at our table with house made salsa.  Everything here is made from scratch.  We ordered queso and guac the first trip.  Queso and salsa verde the second trip.  Queso is soooo good we basically fill up on it.  Guac was fresh tasting and had a nice lime hint to it.  Salsa verde was tangy and pretty standard.  House made salsa (red variety) has a slight smoky note to it.  Not too acidic and smooth tasting.  It's very good.  You grab a scrantron form on the table and fill in the bubbles with your order.  Makes ordering easy since the server just has to pick it up when you are done.  And they deliver your order to the table by name.  Very efficient.  I've had chicken, chorizo, and braised beef tacos with a variety of toppings and sauces.  Each sauce is tasty and I found my favorite yesterday.  The special sauce.  Next time I go that will go on everything.  Spicy, tangy, with a smooth spice finish.  It's excellent.  All the meats are tender, well seasoned, and delicious.  My favorite is the chorizo.  Everything was correct with our orders both times except for one thing.  I ordered corn shell tacos yesterday and got hard shell.  I didn't say anything because I didn't want to waste the food.  I just ate it.  I really would have preferred the corn shells.  The hard were ok.  This place is worthy of 4 stars.  Adding Nowait app to their service would probably make it 5 stars to cut down on wait times.  Especially since they have a very limited wait area.  Other than that I really like the Day of the Dead vibe on the walls and items hanging from the ceilings.  Cool place."}
{"text":"If you're into crappy queso, soggy tacos and a repeating playlist alternating between mariachi bands and ska, you're in for a treat: This place is going to be your jam!"}
{"text":"My review based on two separate experiences at Barrios:  Food - you are going here for tacos and they are largely forgettable. They lack flavour and rely entirely on the overwhelming sauces for any taste.  Need to find a better taco place in Cleveland.  Drinks - pretty good beer selection and very good cocktails.   Atmosphere - it's a decent place to hang out with friends and have a drink; don't expect too much, it's the taco equivalent of TGIFridays  Service - first time our \"chef\" grossly screwed up our tacos and the server told us that if we had taken a bite we would have to pay for it. We only knew the taco was screwed up after taking the bite. Second time we didn't have issues but didn't order much food.  Cleanliness - they go for the \"dive\" look but cleanliness is not an issue   Encore? - likely will not come back"}
{"text":"Good salsa, guac and  cheese dips. The tacos (I made my own) were all shredded cheese and barely any meat. I counted 2.5 shrimps on my shrimp taco. Disappointing, but at least they are super cheap ($3 each). Next time I will skip the pound of cheese per taco."}
{"text":"Just the best place near 4th street for a quick bite or drink. Prices are amazing for sure.  Try the special tacos or get take out!  Can't say enough about this place other than I wish they took reservations, been there when dead and had to wait for table other times.  Best tacos around by far."}
{"text":"Always my favorite place. While I enjoy the atmosphere at Tremont a bit more, the food is equally as good at Lakewood, and the ambiance is still great! Their salsa is one of my favorites. Pineapple guacamole is a must. I've had a million Margs/tequila drinks here, always well-made (Pear's my personal fave). You can't go wrong with any of the taco options. I've made at least 25 diff combos - all were good. Chorizo in a green goddess w/cilantro/onions, chihuahua, salsa verde, and cilantro lime aioli & pulled pork in a white widow w/jicama slaw, smoked cheddar, pineapple salsa, chipotle crema, and habanero mango BBQ today. Both good. ALWAYS good. Best. Place. Ever."}
{"text":"Second time at this establishment. Sitting at the bar on a very slow night. Bartenders are more rude than anywhere I have ever been. If it weren't for the good food, I'd never come back!"}
{"text":"Barrio is a fun entertaining experience if you're looking for good American style tacos. The atmosphere is a little louder which fits it's style but it's a fun place to hangout and eat. The ordering system is very unique allowing the customer to fully build your taco the way you want them. Each person gets a sheet of listed ingredients and you select each topping listed in order. The food is high quality, fresh homemade everything. You also get endless chips & dip so make sure to not over order, many first timers go there thinking they can each four-five tacos but really most people have two or three tops. The margaritas are amazing here! My only complaint about Barrio is that every beer is served in a mason jar glass, which if you're into craft you know glassware is a big part of the flavor of the beer, it's just sad because their beer selection is phenomenal but the mason jar just kills a lot of each beers flavor. Also note when building a taco to not get too wild with salsas or sauces because if you add too many your taco will get soggy."}
{"text":"Gosh, I really don't want to give this four stars because I hate the service here so much, but the food is SO GOOD!  I've been here several times and I'm not kidding when I say that the service is always somewhere between bad and lukewarm. However, if you can just brush it off and get down to the delicious business of eating tacos--then you're good!  I have loved every taco that I've ordered here and I've never had a bad one come out of the kitchen. Their fish special is always on my order list because it's never done me wrong--and has often been the best thing!  Only thing I would change is having the tortillas be warm. They range between stone cold and barely room temperature which I think really takes something away from the whole experience. (Plus, it saps heat from the meat and you can end up with a cold taco.)"}
{"text":"I came here the other night with my boyfriend. The atmosphere and decor are really fun!! The food was awesome. We had the create-your-own tacos which was a cool idea. There were so many options to choose from, which can benefit a party of diverse eaters. Our server and the cooks were very accommodating of my food allergies and advised me on what I could and couldn't eat. That's always very comforting! The margaritas were also a must have. I had the blood orange margarita which was sweet but had great flavor. My boyfriend had the Diablo (?) marg and loved it! I would highly recommend coming here for a late night stop with friends."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Barrio Lakewood on a very cold evening. We were seated at the table right in front of the door... which was left wide open... in 55 degree weather. We could tell the poor hostess was freezing and closed it when we asked, but two different workers came over to open it again. We kept having to ask them to close it.  Service was terrible. The hipster-wannabes working at this place need to drop the attitude and act a little more interested. It was like we were an inconvenience if we asked any type of question at all.  The margarita was not good, and I am no stranger to margaritas.   2 of my tacos were good, the once sauce I got was amazing. The other taco with beef tasted off, and there was something disconcertingly crunchy in it. You know when you're eating something and you think you're crunching on bone or glass but you aren't sure? Yeah, it was like that.  And it was $10 for 3 tacos. Joking, right? At least make them slightly bigger than the palm of my hand.  Oh, and they got my friend's order wrong and didn't care to fix it.  Won't be visiting this one or the one in Tremont. Paying close to $20 before tip for 3 small-ish taco, a crappy drink and really, really poor service is not for me."}
{"text":"Bless you, Hipster Taco Joint.   As with so many other ethnically-inspired eateries in town (I'm looking at you, Noodlecat, Choolah. Nothing but love!), Barrio brings modern foodie sensibilities to a traditional cuisine in the best possible way.   I love choosing every last ingredient that goes into my tacos. I love even more that each one of those ingredients is fresh and flavorful. Every time I eat at Barrio, I leave feeling like I've had, all things considered, a reasonably healthful meal. For the price point, it's a winning combination and a fun night out."}
{"text":"Another trip to Cleveland, driving by looking for parking and spotted a place lit up with signs promising tequila and tacos. SOLD.   Walked in, greeted by someone who appeared to be the bouncer, checked the place out before being seated and it's really nice inside, dimly lit, not overly loud and decorated really cool with paintings of skeletons wearing sombreros, pouring bottles of alcohol    Menu was a small card where you build your own taco with ingredients you want, similar to Chipotle but without the line. I decided to order a beef taco with a few ingredients. Sour cream is $1 extra for some reason here but is needed, and it comes on the side in a cup which was weird too but not a problem. Food tasted great, you get a medium sized taco for $3-$4 cant really complain and why would you need more than one? But if you did, its only like $6.   Place is cool, I would stop by again. Friends loved it."}
{"text":"Love Barrio. Love the Spicy Sapanaro. The taco shell choices are amazing and I've spent too much money here.  The drinks are also"}
{"text":"Meh. I don't see why this place is a big deal. My boyfriend and I stumbled in there one evening to sample some of their delicacies on the recommendation of a friend.  Now, I'm more of a Taco Tantos girl, but you can't live your life in a taco bubble. You gotta get out there and broaden your horizions. There are so many Taco Tuesdays in one's life!  I only ordered a chicken taco as I wasn't terribly hungry, having filled up on hors d'oeuvre at a previous event. I took one bite and stopped. Something wasn't right. Not that I need everything to taste like it was smothered in Old El Paso taco seasoning, but whatever they put on it was not jellin'.   On top of that, I don't think our waitress could have given a fajita if we were there or not. It was a busy Friday night, but hey, at least be a little nice.  In conclusuon, I have no intention of going back. I will continue to trudge around town sampling Mexican cuisine, but I will more often than not be at Taco Tantos.  Viva la taco!"}
{"text":"Fun, casual place where you get to build your own taco. LOTS of drinks to choose from which is awesome, and is located in a prime spot. I didn't have the best experience, as they mixed up a few of my meat/topping combos and actually brought us an extra taco that we didn't order (or want), but I would go again just for the fun ambiance!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I think I've finally gotten in jive with Barrio.  Drinks:  Try the tequila flights.  It's quite the deal!  Otherwise the Margaritas are fine, but not overwhelming.  Tacos:  Take the time to think your tacos through.  Every time I get something different and sometimes they are spectacular and sometimes, despite being filled with many delicious things, it just turns out \"strange\".  I'm a big fan of the pork filling and the chicken.  (Note:  The Queso, though great doesn't go with everything on a taco I've found out...stick with the Manchuga and Chihuahua as they seem to mix better.)  Apps:  Every time I get the house queso.  It's amazing.  The Guacs are okay but underwhelming too.  Staff:  Barrio's finally gotten their staff in check.  They're prompt, know their stuff and keep us happy.  There used to be a lot of errors and kitchen mistakes but I've not been running into that as much lately.  Atmosphere:  Great!  Eclectic, but not too much.  The happy hour is only applicable in the front dining area - this does make me sad because they have an awesome patio."}
{"text":"Alright so maybe I'm a LA taco snob, but this place is trying a little too hard! I get the whole creative taco building idea, but really, the simpler, the better. There were so many choices in every category on the menu, that I didn't really know where to start. I was with family, and we all ordered plenty of boozy drinks to keep us occupied before our food came out.  Skinny margarita for me, straight up with lime juice, YUM. I had a few too many, but it was worth it. If I just came here for drinks and maybe chips and guac, I would be pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"The tacos are good but small. Well worth the $3. Drinking here is wicked expensive but they have awesome happy hours and bar only specials. They also have very unique and tasty margs and a ton of crafts on tap. Try to go during a weeknight happy hour for the best experience. It gets extremely busy on weekends."}
{"text":"I'm writing and rating specifically for the special guacamole with shrimp. Got one order of this to be shared with 2 others. We were disappointed to not even taste any shrimp. Upon getting towards the bottom of the bowl, we finally find the shrimp...the whole lot of 3 baby shrimp!! Wow yeah perfect though right cause there are 3 of us? Disappointment.   To end on a positive note, we wholeheartedly enjoyed our tacos."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  I now live in Boston but grew up in Lakewood, and every time I come back to visit family and friends I always make a date at least once to eat at Barrio (if I'm lucky, sometimes twice).    Their margaritas are the best I've ever had (and that's after living in the southwest for several years!).  I love making my own tacos and trying new combinations every time I go, and nothing beats free chips and salsa!    Barrio is a Lakewood must, so if you haven't been there yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"The food it just amazing. Not horribly \"traditional\" but very few in the states aren't a true traditional. Favor selection is almost to much to much but truest me, you will appreciate the work. Love to see the Cleveland company expanding."}
{"text":"Just go here, trust me. Cheap tacos with gourmet ingredients, cool atmosphere. One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I have been a few times. I went tonight and sat on the patio. My server was unbelievably nice and knowledgeable! The food came quickly and was delicious! I got a green goddess taco (guacamole and queso between a hard and soft shell). It was fantastic! I had a sunshine Pilsner as well that was good. I'd highly recommend Barrio in Lakewood to anyone visiting! Great dinner!"}
{"text":"Why are your tacos so cold, Barrio?  Margaritas are good, bartenders are efficient, chips are quality.  But the tacos.  The raison d'etre. Are cold. every. time."}
{"text":"Tacos are amazing, why we keep going back.  I love their guac. Specifically the Tuscan. it's been different each time. The first time it was perfect. Second time made with different ingredients. Third time it was sloppy and over oxidized...brown and bland. Not appetizing.   The first few times we have gone, we were very confused. The only way we got service was if we sat at the bar. I dont know if it was because it was late. But if we sat at a table we had no service, therefore we had to go to the bar to drop off our orders for drinks and food.  It does get noisy.  As of our last visit, we have found redemption from Barrio.   Upon walking in we were greeted with a smile from the host and she sat us at a table in the dining area. Low and behold WE GOT A SERVER! she brought us waters, and for the first time we got chips and salsa? we never got chips and salsa before. i dont know if this is a new thing or not. but it was nice. We decided to get the Tuscan guac again...it was perfect this time. Of course the tacos were great. so star for the redemption.  I love tacos."}
{"text":"By far the best tacos I have ever eaten!! However, the Margaritas were just mediocre. I watched one of the bartenders pour the cheap flavoring mix into the frozen machine. I wish they would get a more premium mix, I'm sure no one would complain about a higher price for a better quality"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, good location, fair drinks and beautiful interior.  However, the tacos just aren't good.  They really aren't good. Bad even for the already low standards of Cleveland Mexican food. Barrio's desire to emulate happy dog's menu style results in a mess of available options that just aren't enjoyable to eat.  Service could have been better, but this is likely more subjective depending on night and server.    Absolutely an interesting place and beautiful to look at (the bar is so swank), but the food and service was not on par with similar establishments."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had.  Salsa is always on point.  Service is always friendly and fast.  Margarita's are tasty.  Good job Barrio."}
{"text":"I have been to Barrio several times and been nothing but satisfied every time...until last night and it wasn't food (how could it be?) but the service (BIG THUMBS DOWN).  We went to Barrio after our teams softball practice and we sat in the little hole in the wall yellow room because there was not any room outside. Understandable, not the least bit upset about that.  AND THEN...our waiter came over and asked for our drink order and that's when things went down hill. A friend order a SoCo and ginger, they don't have SoCo...fine. So he then looked at the menu and decided on Johnny Walker and ginger. Waiters response \"Uhhhh do we have that?\" Well since its on the menu, I would assume you do and as a waiter working for this restaurant, you should probably know these things.  Waiter asks what I would like to drink, I say a Peach Mojito please (I get this every time I go there) He said \"we don't have mojitos\" I then explained to him that I have gotten them several times before and he responded with \" Well it's not on the menu, is it?\" Whooooaaa bro! At that point, I wasn't trying to argue but it was rather aggravating and I realize that mojitos are not on the menu but I have had them there several other times.  ...so that's my bad experience at Barrio  I'm assuming it was a one-time thing hence why I still gave them 4 stars.   GREEN GODDESS is nothing short of amazing every time and sopapillo chips are always excellent as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined here early on a Saturday evening.  Our food was good, I particularly liked my chicken taco with pineapple salsa and a spicy mango habanero sauce, and the pulled pork was delicious as well.  My boyfriend had a Jack-a-rita and really liked it.   But to be honest our service was so good that they could have served us garbage and we would have had a great experience.  Our server Jess was beyond excellent, she wasn't just efficient, attentive and friendly but she anticipated our every need and did it with genuine kindness.  We will be back just to request her as our server.  The ambiance was very fun, it was hard not to have a good time while sitting next to three skeletons taking a \"selfie,\" The only part of our service we didn't enjoy was the hostess, she rolled her eyes a bit when we came in, and then just kind of threw our menus down and mumbled a few words as she snapped her gum and walked away, we found it to be a rough first impression, which Jess did a fantastic job recovering from.  Thank you Barrio, all in all we were fans and will be back."}
{"text":"I was literally thrown to the ground and kicked out because a lady with shoes in her hand (at 1am) couldn't be served and I  stood up for her...  I never ate and I pray no one ever eats there while this bouncer is there... especially at 1 am if they have band-aids in their feet.."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  I wish I would have taken pictures but they wouldn't have done the food justice.  Great bar with huge whiskey and beer selection.  Tacos were amazing. My favorite was thE El Jeffe.  Starting at $3.00 you can't go wrong.  Great atmosphere and staff."}
{"text":"My My, where to begin with this goldmine. I for one am obsessed with tacos, so I have been around the block as far as taco tasting goes. When I first heard about this place, I was skeptical. People were saying it was the best taco place in the area, so naturally I was a doubter. The food will take awhile to get to you after the order, but I would probably wait for an entire week for these tacos. They provide house recipes ( for the uncreative), or you can create your own by putting EXACTLY what you want in your taco. These things are also beasts. I can go and order two tacos and be pleasently full. I highly suggest the green goddess which is a heavenly version of a cheesy gordita crunch from taco bell. It is a hard shell inside a soft shell stuck together with queso and guac. Boom! Mindblown. The drinks also come in mason jars, and their Margs are amazing. Good friendly service, just plan on being there for a bit, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"We love Barrio, however I hate to say, you might not want to order out. The past several times we have ordered from the new location in Cleveland Heights, it has been a disappointment. Our tacos have been really soggy and who really wants a soggy taco? Their guacamole is always on point but the chips are overly greasy. If I were to suggest this place, I'd say to go and dine in or go to the Tremont location. Ordering out is kind of just a waste of money and you'll be sadly disappointed. Can't speak for other locations as I haven't ordered take out at any other locations. Nonetheless they have great tacos in which you can make your own combinations or order from their specialty menu. Their dips are always delish and drinks are a must do!  My advice, dine in for the best experience :)"}
{"text":"I love Barrio, but this location has some of the worst service I've ever experienced. I'm an avid fan of taco Tuesday so I went once a week for almost a month and a half since moving here. Service was great the first two times but steadily declined. The hostesses never seem to know what's going on and offer to seat me in a happy hour area only to not have tables available. Waiters have started becoming more standoffish. And I had the worst bartender I've ever had here two weeks ago. The minute my friend and I sat down he barely looked at us, took 15 minutes to bring our drinks, didn't bring chips and salsa without me asking and then essentially threw them at us, and would look at our taco orders but didn't take them to put them in for over 20 minutes after noticing them. He also was rude to the customers nearby and never brought one girl her drink. While there's more to the story I experienced, I also found out he dropped a drink on my friends a week before and I'm sure he's done this to others. I was so uncomfortable I don't plan on going back to this location..."}
{"text":"I love Barrio. But this branch is not well run. It's too small and the staff looks overworked, particularly when it's later in the evening and all tables are full. Our waitress had at least 10 tables that I counted and was also bar tending.   It should also not take 45 minutes to bring four tacos to a two person table.  As an aside, I've had the chips at every branch, and these are the worst out of the three by far. Cedar Fairmount chips are the best, followed by downtown, and then here. Half the time they come out cold and every time there's not enough salt.   Least favorite branch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a friend on a Tuesday night.   Not a whole lot to the menu, you choose your toppings on the tacos. Simple. They also had a few Barrio Specials to choose from. So, I ordered one that I made up and one of the special.  The tacos were ok. I think they would be super amazing at 2am on a Saturday, but sober, they were just ok. The sauce was flavorful, but I didn't think that the meat really had any flavor of its own. The sauce was also not well distributed, some bites had lots, others had none. However, I don't want to sound too down on the place, the tacos were inexpensive and tasted decent. Just nothing I would think, \"wow I have to come back and have this again.\"   Now, what was good was the chips and salsa. Chips were crispy and perfectly salted and salsa was flavorful with just the right amount of heat. Yum. We also got the Tuscan guacamole. I would have never tried to pair the balsamic vinegar, pine nuts, and basil with the guac, but somehow it worked. Creative! I would go back for the guac and have a taco to go with it, not the other way around.   As far as margaritas go  I had the house lime margarita. Other reviewers said they were strong, but today, it was not. Not a bad drink, but not great either. Also not super thrilled with the mason jar presentation, I don't think it works with the margarita and the salt on the rim.  Service and atmosphere were good. The waiter was very attentive. The place had a good vibe. Even though the tacos weren't awesome, it would be a fun place for a group of friends to get together."}
{"text":"Ok - this is the Happy Dog of tacos! I love, love, love it! You get an order form and golf pencils to fill in your name and build your tacos. Or, they have some chef's suggestions.   The whole place is very hipster/contemporary. Very dia de los muertos feel. :) I loved it. And - they have awesome margaritas.   You can't go wrong at this place... except during \"taco happy hour\" because there is no where to sit!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for happy hour only in my opinion. I'm not too big on tacos however I do enjoy them with a good margarita."}
{"text":"I seem to be in conflict with the masses on this one. When I first told a friend that I'd never been to Barrio, he was shocked and we made plans soon after. I've now been a couple of times and have nothing but great things to say about the Lakewood location, but this one seems to come up short.   The tacos are good. Very good, even, but again, what I've gotten at this location (even when ordering the same thing, like El Jefe) hasn't been as good as the other one I've been to. The service has also been good.   Why three stars then? A couple of reasons:  1. Everyone raves about the margaritas, but the ones I had were very weak. If I have a glass of wine, I'll feel it; two glasses and I'm tipsy. I had three (three!) margaritas here and didn't feel a thing. If I had three margaritas at Bakersfield, I'd be on the floor. What gives?   2. On my last visit, we ordered the Three Amigos appetizer sampler to go with our chips. We chose the elote, the special guacamole, and the pineapple salsa. The elote was fine (a bit funky, but I think it was supposed to be). The special guac had cranberries and jalapeños and was really good. The pineapple salsa had a funky taste to it. I assumed this was just some hipster trend and that it was supposed to taste that way, but then I was sick for a day and a half after. I'd think a place with a minimum half hour wait no matter the time of day would run through salsa so quickly that it wouldn't have time to go bad, and I'm not here to give an establishment a bad name...all that said, that salsa was not okay.   Overall, Barrio is fine and I'd return if friends wanted to meet up."}
{"text":"I wanted to make a point to my review, from a recent discovery at my last visit to Barrio.   The food is still awesome, concept great, but a major turn off....Happy Hour is only available at the BAR!!!!   WHA?? No where is this rule advertised, until you are the unfortunate late comer, who misses all the availability in the \"bar' area.  It's like saying, \"hey you people in the other room, you will pay full price for your drinks and tacos....and like it\"   We visited a couple of weeks ago, made the point to at least get there for the last 45 minutes of \"Happy Hour\", and were seated in the dining room.   I asked the server what the specials were, and was rudely told that it's only in the bar. I started to protest, but was quickly told \" I don't make the rules\" .  Rude!!!  I will continue to love Barrio, but I am making a strong plea for all involved in the institution of this silly policy.    If you are going to have \"Happy\" hour, then make it HAPPY for everyone who walks in your door!"}
{"text":"On the plus side Barrio has a pretty unique concept and ambience. When we arrived it was packed but it didn't take us long to get a table. Well under the 35 min time we were quoted. We ordered margaritas, chips and queso at the bar while we're waiting- and that was perfecto! The bartender was suuuuuper happy, helpful, fun and all an around awesome guy! If we ended the night there I'd give this place 5 stars for sure! Unfortunately for us,  after this point the wind was taken out of her sales by someone named... our waitress. I'm not exaggerating when I say she was so rude, she made us wait forever- for everything, and really ruined the vibe that we had going from the first half of our experience at this funky fun establishment. Oh and the build your own tacos was cool and our table was outside which we loved, but with such disappointing service I almost forgot about those things because what's the point. Long story short- if you're looking for a trendy place to have a good time you should check out Barrio but only if your willing to eat and drink at the bar!!"}
{"text":"The five star rating I have awarded Barrio is solely a result of one waiter's excellent service. This waiter's name was Jae, and I am very thankful for his kindness and generosity. Before I get to that, let me start a little bit in the past.  The previous week, my family and I ate at Barrio for the first time. The build your own taco concept at a sit-down restaurant was a riveting idea to us newcomers. Our waitress that night was also very welcoming and friendly overall, which was a good sign for a restaurant new to us. In addition, and very importantly, the food was DELICIOUS. Every member of my family and myself were satisfied with our meals. So that was my first experience at Barrio, and I was pleasantly pleased.   Now back to the more recent past. On Saturday, June 17, 2017, I decided to take my girlfriend, who has tree nut and shellfish allergies along with a gluten intolerance (this part will come into play later), to Barrio. All was well at first. There was no wait as we arrived at a good time, and immediately the hostess took us to our table in a back corner. Unfortunately, and for no fault of the hostess, we were placed next to a large party of inebriated and obnoxious women. Like I said, there isn't much one can do about that at first for the customer. After saying \"what\" when my girlfriend and I could not hear each other, we decided we wanted to move. At this point, the waitress came to give us water and asked if we wanted chips and guac. Everything was going as well as it could be and she came back to take our order sheets. Upon her arrival, my girlfriend asked if the gluten free taco shells were fried in peanut oil or anything of the sort. In a very uninformed (in regard to the menu) and annoyed tone, the waitress told us she thinks, and ONLY THINKS, that they were fried in vegetable oil. There was no confidence in her response and that is not very reassuring to someone with food allergies. So back to changing seats. We asked her and she mumbled something and said she couldn't take our sheets yet until the hostess is informed of our requested. Then our savior arrived unbeknownst to us. He brought our guac and chips and commented on how loud it was and we told him we already asked to move tables. After this, the waitress came back and asked if we were able to move and then explained that we had to go back to the hostess to see if we could be moved. After this, I went to the hostess and asked what could be done. She said I would have to go back on the waiting list and that was not worth it. As I went to sit back down, the kind waiter asked if we were able to move tables. I explained, in a partially worked up manner, that both the hostess and waitress were not the nicest or accommodating. The waiter responded \"that's sh%#ty,\" and then said \"grab your stuff, you guys can follow me.\" He proceeded to take us to a new area of a restaurant that was pleasant and the air was not polluted with the deafening sound of intoxicated imbeciles. My girlfriend and I were very happy at this point and repeatedly thanked our savior. Following all if this, we got our food. My girlfriend then asked about the peanut oil and our new waiter went and asked the kitchen and told us that their shells were fried in canola oil, which was very comforting to know. We were finally able to eat in peace thanks to Jae, the wonderful waiter.   If it wasn't for Jae, my second meal and my girlfriend's first meal at Barrio would have been less than average due to the surliness of the waitress and hostess. My thanks go out to Jae and to his wonderful service. I firmly believe that each and every member of the Barrio staff should emulate the actions of Jae, as he is the epitome of a superior waiter."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love taco Tuesday??! !!! Barrio doesn't disappoint with their menu of handcrafted specialty tacos or their build your own menu.  Their easy ordering system allows you to pencil in your specifications and quantity.  The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is that some of the menu was written in Mexican, and I can't read Mexican."}
{"text":"We tried Barrio when visiting Cleveland a few months ago due to the raving reviews from the readers on Reddit. We walked from the rock hall and it was late afternoon so we were stoked once we finally arrived and we're seated.  Our waiter kind of sucked. He was very socially awkward, but we didn't let that ruin our experience.  The food was great and we would definitely return upon returning to Cleveland :)"}
{"text":"Heard so much hype and so happy that there's a location in Willoughby! LOVE the laidback vibe that this place has---it's a chill atmosphere where you get served with free chips and salsa and then you can build your own tacos! Super straightforward ordering the tacos and it was so fun to order! Get the green goddess taco upgrade- totally worth the extra $1 to get a hard shell encased in a soft shell taco to give a crunchy texture!! Also I cannot forget to rave about the margaritas!! They're served in mason jars and has just the right amounts of liquor to hit the spot! I love love it here and will definitely be back soon! The only con is the slightly difficult parking in the lots so get there early!! However, bring your friends and family because it feels very social and you'll enjoy the vibes there!! :)"}
{"text":"The tacos are alright. I did like the fact that you can build your own tacos. One of the tacos I had was a special for that night, which was supposed to have fish. I guess by fish taco, they really mean taco with a bunch of mushrooms, and a small, sad sardine.  If you're an indecisive person and can't decide what to build, they have other taco creations you can order. Don't forget to order the quest blanco, which comes with a side of tortilla chips. It's probably so bad for you but it's SO good, with all it's melty, gooey, cheesiness. That was probably the highlight of my meal. That or the crazy beer (and tequila, but I'm not a fan. I've been scarred since college) selection that they have."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! I had heard from a few people that this place was delicious (and cheap!) So, I finally checked it out the other night and I fell in love! We started off with chips and the house salsa (complimentary)- I thought the salsa was OK. Not amazing, but not terrible. The chips were yummy. We also ordered the queso blanco, which was creamy and delish. Everything is ordered on pads of order forms and pencils.  You build your own tacos (I still haven't been to happy dog, but I've heard that it's similar- just with tacos!). You start with the shell (corn, flour, both with queso, guac, etc.. etc). Then you add your protein (meats, tofu, black beans). Then, you have a HUGE list of cheeses, sauces, and toppings! Pretty sure I had almost everything on one of my tacos!  The service is good. Everything comes out pretty fast. And, all of the servers are very friendly.  We sat in the dining area and the patio was open so the entire restaurant was hot and humid- that kind of sucked :-\, but towards the end of the meal, the sun had set and it was a bit cooler.   I didn't actually order a marg during this visit (not sure why) but I heard they were fantastic!   I'll def be coming back (often) - can't wait to try the margs!"}
{"text":"I am giving Barrio a 5 star review because of unique... Ordering experience, fun atmosphere, value and overall experience.   At Barrio, you get the paper and check off what you want. Or you can try one of the suggested tacos. That being said... If you make up your own taco and it's not that good??? Well that's your fault. If you order one of the pre-made tacos and you don't like it? Well, maybe it's not your style. I guess there is more to it tho.  I ordered a fish taco of my own design and loved it! I ordered some sort of braised pork taco and didn't so much love. I didn't like the consistency of the pork, but I was glad to try it! I would never order it again I hated it. The orders came out quick, they accommodated our party in a reasonable time, the parking situation is atrocious, never go here. That being said I had a great time! I would go again. Maybe go another night than Friday with 6 other friends?? Just throwin' that out there. Take it or leave it.   The tacos were 3 and 4 dollars and the margarita was 6$. I hate it when I order a drink and its 10$ except when I am expecting a drink to be that much (which is never because I am cheap). But I thought that was reasonable.   The waitress did stare at our backs. Did she want us to leave? Or make sure we were doing excellent. Not sure! Barrio!  Go to Barrio! Why not!"}
{"text":"Very small, usually always busy, but I was still sat right away. The chips are good and so is their quest and salsa, but the tacos my friends and I ordered were so spicy that we couldn't eat them. It's $3 a taco and you get a lot for your money's worth. I would give this place another chance, but it didn't meet up to the expectations I had going in."}
{"text":"Braised beef taco called moo chas gracias and the pulled pork called asta la vista baby. So naming interesting so far. Had dog fish chocolate cream stout available on tap, nice. The braised beef has the secret barrio sauce which has habanero in it so be prepared for spicy hot taste and sweating (at least for me). Service fast and friendly.  Get here if you can. Being in Tremont is a plus too. Conversation with random bar stool dwellers was cool. Talked about the various strip clubs in c town. Very entertaining and friendly."}
{"text":"Barrio catering is fantastic! Excellent, reasonably priced food delivered on time with all the utensils and serving dishes you need. It's a laid back,  delicious crowd-pleaser!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this location to open for a while! So happy it finally opened. Great location. Nice space. Will be coming here often. Much bigger than all the other locations. I had their brunch tacos for the first time and they were so good! Highly recommend for all meals!"}
{"text":"Who cannot like Barrios. The best tacos ever. Good selection of drinks and only place I know where one can get tequila n whiskey on tap."}
{"text":"I love the construct of this place: a built it yourself taco, adequately priced. Order forms are on the table and just check mark what you want. Or if you're indecisive, choose from some pre-made Barrio creations. The order form is long, which is nice. It's great to have options (proteins, cheeses, vegetables, types of tortilla, sauces etc). It gets very messy. This place's popularity has caught on and has expanded to Lakewood, downtown, Progressive field and I hear coming to Cleveland Heights as well. No other place like this (it's like the Happy Dog of tacos). And reasonably priced ($3 each), I get pretty satisfied with 2 tacos. I always go to the Tremont Barrio, so parking is on the street, good luck. Plus this place is cool AF so expect a wait. But, definitely worth the wait. Oh yeah, if you like different hot sauces, there is a wall of like 50 different kinds to try."}
{"text":"Will never come back!!! The bartender /\"manager\" at night is terrible. .. we order 6 tacos and was expected to pay 30.00! Are u kidding me . He was the most rude service person I've ever had to deal with.  He told.me to just give him 2.50 for the fuckin tortilla chips. If I didn't have to put a star they would get negative 10! I'm so disappointed in the service and lack of customer service that it's astonishing.  Very bad"}
{"text":"Best taco option available in the Cleve! Went to Cleveland for a baseball game and enjoyed the build your own taco option. We waited for 20mims to be seated but it was very busy. They gave us a pager and beeped us when our table was ready. The waiter was friendly and explained how the ordering system worked.the complimentary nachos are amazing, the right amount of salt and they kept bring out baskets of them.  I love this place. 2 adults and 2 kids ate for $30 including 5$ tip! Great value, great quality, great atmosphere. I love this place, I wish I lived in Cleveland just so I could come here every day"}
{"text":"So I walked in and went straight to the bar area. There's a \"create a taco\" booklet with pencils.  This is where one can get super creative. I got the beef, steak and pork tacos.  I really played mad scientist with the different toppings. Once done, just slid my order sheet to the bartender and waited for my tacos. I went around 3pm today (Sunday) and it wasn't a long wait at all.  I was super shocked that I got full off two tacos...just imagine how I felt after the third one...oh boy!  Didn't really eat one of them because I felt super bold and decided to try the ghost pepper sauce. Why you ask? Well 1) I like hot stuff and 2) I had it before, no big deal, right? Nope...lol, my server looked at me and asked if I was okay...I struggled to mention that \"it's the ghost pepper sauce that has me crying\". I told him that I had it before but on some wings, he told me that usually they sweetened it up but here, at Barrio, we give it to you straight. Surprise surprise, I felt like a wimp lol.   I really like the décor of the place...skulls everywhere. No, I'm not being morbid, I just like skulls (sidenote: 90% of my tattoos are all skulls). The interaction with staff and patrons is decent. They're not rude, just it really didn't exist that much (hey I can't help that I'm a talkative person, especially when dining alone).    I really like this place, especially if you are on a budget and down for some cheap eats and drinks. It really doesn't take much to get full either lol."}
{"text":"I finally caved to the hype that is Barrio, and I will say that it was just as hipster and culturally appropriated as I expected it to be, but gosh darn those tacos were delicious.   I'll start by saying that coming at 7pm on a Friday night when I was nearing the point of \"hangry\" was probably not my finest hour of planning, but I came hopeful that I might be able to snag a  few spots at the bar. After putting in for two with the hostess, and were informed there were 16 parties ahead of us, we took a buzzer and made a beeline for the bar. I will say it was a little annoying that there was barely room to stand near the bar, while still allowing room for the servers to get by with loaded trays,  but with salted margaritas in hand, we waited patiently. We ended up getting lucky and snagging two spots at the bar as two people were just leaving.   The bartender was really friendly and attentive even though they were clearly really busy, she didn't really take the time to explain the concept of the menu, but it seemed pretty explanatory (choose your own shell, meat, toppings and sauce; they also have suggestions on the menu if you feel overwhelmed by all the possible combinations). I ordered two beef tacos and a fish taco, along with some chips and guacamole to start. The chips and guac came out really fast....like freaky fast, which surprised me considering how busy it was. I didn't expect much of the guacamole, but I am happy to report it was really, really good guacamole, and the salsa was amazing as well. They kept the chips coming as well, which again was impressive considering how busy it was.   The tacos came out shortly after, wrapped in tin foil (very convenient to avoid making too much of a mess). I had chosen the \"white widow\" variation for my shell, which included a flour tortilla, guacamole, sour cream, and a \"crunch with a kick\" (still not sure what that was, but it was delicious). The beef was shredded and super tender, and it was really nice that you could choose your own toppings, although it could be a little overwhelming for a first-timer. The fish tacos were mediocre in my opinion, but it could be because the toppings I chose didn't compliment the fish well.   As for the margaritas, they were perfectly fine; I've certainly had better at cheaper, more dodgey looking Mexican restaurants, but it was nice that they had a lot of flavors to choose from. I think they were just a little sweet for my taste.   As a whole, I really enjoyed my visit to Barrio, although next time I hope to come when it is perhaps a little less busy, I was really impressed with the service I received despite the fact that it was so busy. If you were on the hunt for \"authentic\" Latin American food, this certainly would not be it, but I would definitely come back and recommend to others because the food & service did not disappoint."}
{"text":"When your taco menu looks like a math test,  it adds up to trouble.  Create your own taco goodness or choose from a list of favorites.  When you choose your own ingredients,  it's your own fault if you don't like the food.  The margaritas are talking..."}
