{"text":"I was really impressed with this place. The owners are very personable, and the pizza was quick, delicious, and reasonably priced. Definitely going again!"}
{"text":"I googled Best pizza in Calgary and up came a place I've never heard of called Pizzeria Gaga. Well it lives up to its reputation and the many positive reviews. I give this a five out of five for ambiance which is very casual but cosy and quality of food which was absolutely delicious with homemade dough and the tomato paste is superb. The owners are lovely people and made us feel like we were in a special place. We like the no cell phone policy which encourages old fashion engagement. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My new favourite place for takeout. Good thin crust and quality toppings - for example their plain pepperoni is great, which is rare in Calgary.

I recommend some of their unconventional pies like the Stella Rossa Belgrado (ham, bacon, prune, feta and mozzarella) and the Nikola Tesla (potato, onion and walnut with white sauce)."}
{"text":"Excellent and VERY flavourful pizza! By far the most exceptional pizza I have had yet. The service was fantastic and You also get to eat your pizza then pay!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great pizza, even better burek (cheese, beef or potato filled fillo pastry)! Highly recommended! 10/10! They serve very good (Starbucks) coffee. Really great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I love this place-it's small, unpretentious, and the owners/staff are super funny and friendly. The post-it wall is a hoot and adds character to the establishment, and the little treatshop on the side makes for interesting browsing while your pizza is baking. 
It's a step up from greasy takeout, with quality ingredients like whole wheat crust, figs, and prosciutto. I usually order the personal sized vegetarian, which at $7 is a steal and enough for dinner for a single person. Too bad it's closed on Sundays-I love a treat on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with a lot of variety, friendly (fast) service and great prices. Gaga is a place we frequent and sometimes stay and sometimes take-away."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.  I wasnt overwhelmed with a greasy crust. The ingredients were fresh and the flavors were great.  I liked that you can tell that the sauce is homemade. Really affordable as well"}
{"text":"Fresh toppings and Fast and friendly service! You can have two different flavours in a large pizza. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I am picky about pizza and found this place to be excellent.  Creative gourmet pizzas on an excellent euro-style crust.  Friendly owner who was fun to talk to while waiting for our order.  Best for take out since there are few seats in the restaurant and no beer/wine available."}
{"text":"Been here once long time ago never again pizza was bad the dough was hard the topping where cheap quality never shall I go there again ."}
{"text":"I stopped in today with some coworkers for a quick lunch as Gaga is located next to the new apartment community my company is leasing, The Metropolitan.  The owner was so welcoming and helped us navigate the menu.  I settled on the Sicilia pizza and an Orangina...so amazingly good!   Apparently, everything is good from the pizza to the soup and the sandwiches - guess you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"After my husband and I got back from New York, we went through pizza withdrawals. So glad that this place is within walking distance of our house! The pizza is delicious, and the only downside is that it's closed on Sundays (learned that the hard way)."}
{"text":"After discovering this place last week, I've already been here twice for take-out. It's really good pizza that doesn't get soggy by the time you get home - I like that.  They use quality ingredients on a homemade crust that cooks fast in their super hot ovens. I appreciate that they're a friendly, family run operation in my neighbourhood. It's a relief from chain-style take out pizza."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of italian pizza, and was excited to stumble upon this place as it offers take away. I ordered the Verona. To sum it up, it was 'meh'. $10 for a single serve size? Soo not worth it. I'd rather have an American style pizza, that actually tastes good. There was nothing special about the crust or sauce in taste, and it was too hard on the edges. Toppings were minimal, also they put the tomatoes on AFTER baking the pizza, which was too overpowering. 

The owners are so friendly and nice, I wish I could give a better review! I didn't feel great about hygiene. The owner couldnt get the pizza to shuffle into the box, so he used his fingers to quickly push it in. He didn't actually make the pizza so it wasn't a big deal, but still he was also managing the register so shouldn't have done this."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza is Gaga Seniore. The figs add a subtle, honeyed sweetness to the pizza. The crust and the sauce aren't sweet, which I think helps to balance the saltiness of prosciutto. Great quality ingredients, and the prices are very reasonable too. A large pizza will cost around $17, which is plenty for two hungry people. Add in the lovable husband and wife team, and Gaga Pizzeria gets my five stars:-)"}
{"text":"Owner operated, these guys are super friendly and always good for a laugh and they make great pizza. Try the desert pizza as well!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Pizza Gaga, you are missing out.

Vogglio, Pizza Bob's and Pulcinella's were my mainstays for pizza in Calgary until I chanced upon Pizza Gaga.  By far the best pie I've had in the city, with fresh , traditional ingredients and a commitment to quality I haven't seen anywhere else.  Their location has a few window seats, but isn't really a sit-down place.  Bright, clean, and with shiny new equipment and ovens, their restaurant gives you an accurate impression of the quality of the product they serve.

The owners are very friendly, and will fill you in on their ingredients, flavor combinations, and pretty much anything you want to chat about.  Every time that I've gone in I've been offered a free cookie and coffee while I wait on my pie.  They have around 8 different pizzas to choose from (they'll make your pizza to order, but I highly recommend choosing from the menu).  They refuse to use Westernized ingredients such as pineapple, instead opting for more traditional fare such as figs and prosciutto.  They also have a selection of Mediterranean/European products for sale as well, such as Eurocream and vegetable spreads.  I highly recommend trying a jar of the Eurocream, it's delicious!

Most other pizza places charge more than $20 for a quality pie, but all of Gaga Pizzeria's large pies are under $19, and all of their personal size pies are under $10.  I can't recommend this place enough, go give it a try."}
{"text":"I came to pizzeria Gaga for a second time today as my first experience was great and decided they are probably my new favourite pizza joint in Calgary! That's saying something.

First time I visited Pizzeria Gaga was with some work buddies for lunch. There are few seats there but we all managed to grab a spot. The owner took our orders and said we could pay after we were all done! It was the first time for all of us and the owner/manager came by to check on us and give us a complimentary chocolate. Before I get to the food, I really have to commend them on their amazing service! I rarely talk about service before food but this is one spot where service has definitely not gone unnoticed. 

Now onto the food. I like pizza so the 10\" is more of a personal size and 14\" is more of a 2-person/binge eating day. The pizza crust is amazing here! And the amount of cheese and pizza sauce is just right. There are a ton of new boutique pizza places that have come up in Calgary that just have not cut it for me because somehow their pizzas always come out oily. NOT here! It was perfect. Toppings were fresh and well chosen/matched. On my first visit, I tried the Signora Gaga. I quite enjoyed the combination with figs. Definitely gave off a Mediterranean vibe which was a bit nostalgic for me. Second time, I went a little spicy with the Mamma Mia and ordered it as take out. Again pizza was delicious. To top it all off, the pizza was ready 10 minutes after calling! 

Highly recommend this place for both food and service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love the soup and sandwich. Homemade soup warms you right up. The sandwich is homemade bread and it is so tasty. I work next door and the owners are so friendly. Glad they are next to us!"}
{"text":"Just ordered 2 pizzas on great reviews. $40 dollars later. Ouch! What regret.

Crust = Thumbs Up
Tomato sauce = Thumbs Up
Toppings = A Big Thumbs Down

Toppings were few and far between. Cheese was almost non-existent. I had to put toppings on from home to make it edible. I would have done just as well going to Safeway or Coop and adding my own toppings and popping it in the oven. You have been warned and its your $40 bucks this time round. For real. I'll give this business a pass. For the $$, what a disappointment. As always, you decide."}
{"text":"Very good pizza here. I had a meat craving and got the Mafioso pizza. There's an option for a whole wheat crust so you don't feel guilty about eating half a pizza yourself.  The pizza menu is quite small, but well thought out and the ingredients are high quality. The owner is very nice and friendly and even gave me a chocolate bar for dessert!  Great family owned take out pizza place and there are a couple of high stools if you wanted to enjoy a couple of slices there."}
{"text":"Boss took me out to lunch here, him being Italian i trust his judgement when it comes to food and boy was he right. I love little shops like this quality is outstanding and there was seating outside so i could enjoy my pizza! Best pizza I've had in years! If your anywhere in the beltline in Calgary or even remotely close to gaga it is a must! Super friendly staff and amazing food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Margherita, New York and the Mamma Mia for carry out. The pizza was ready for pickup in about 15 minutes! All of the pizzas were very flavorful, the best was t he Margherita. I've lived near this place for a year now, can't believe I'm only trying it now; Will order from here again!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Great value and really yummy topping combinations. Thin crust, good quality cheese, friendly service. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place! I'm not sure which was better, the pizza or customer service because both were beyond expectations. The couple that owns this restaurant were wonderful to chat with and very generous. Pizza was phenomenal and was an excellent price. Would highly recommend! And the owners have great hiking backgrounds, so I would also trust them with recommendations of things to do around the city and the neighboring national parks."}
{"text":"This pizza is really, really delicious. I try to pretend to myself that I am actually being healthy, because they use fresh ingredients, and have whole wheat crust.

Meh- whatever the excuse is I tell myself, I like coming here weekly. They make pizza FAST. Like its done in 8 minutes type fast. I love that, because when I'm lazy and hungry and being \"healthy\" it gives me the perfect reason to come pick up a pie here."}
{"text":"My Croatian friend took me here recently, and I've got to say I'm disappointed in myself for having passed by so many times but never actually been. It's kind of funny because many reviews talk about Italian style pizza, but when I was over in Italy the majority of the pizzas I had were just not very good. Perhaps I was only hitting up the touristy places, but the only memorable pizza was in Naples; which makes sense I guess, as they supposedly invented it. I could be making that up though. Having also travelled in the ex-Yugo countries, their pizzas were consistently better than what I had in Italy. This place which is owned by serbians  (I think) lives up to that experience.

Our group shared two larges, the Signora Gaga ($22) and Stella Rosa Belgrado ($20). We were going to get more but the owner said that would be plenty, and he was right. They fed 5 people with leftovers. 

The Signora Gaga is mozzarella, spinach, prosciutto, bocconcini, and figs. The prosciutto was fantastic and the figs provided some great sweetness. I would have liked more figs on the pizza, but they were fresh, and I've seen fresh figs go for $1 each at stores, so it's understandable.

The Stella Rosa Belgrado has mozzarella, ham, bacon, prunes, and feta on it. Of the two, I think I preferred this one. The meat quality is incredible, and you can really notice it in the flavours. This pizza is quite delicious for how few ingredients there are.

This actually ended up being way longer than I expected, so to finish up, I recommend trying this place out if you're looking for a great thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"Mamma Mia! Itza new pizzeria! This stretch of 12th Ave is starting to get some really cute little businesses.

I was wandering around looking for dinner and noticed the sign for Gaga Pizzeria glowing red across the dark street. \"Hmmm, I wonder how long that's been there?\" I pondered. So, across the road I went to check it out.

The pizzeria isn't a sit down spot, it's a walk-in/take-out kind of joint. As soon as I walked in the door, this adorable little Italian woman jumped up from her seat by the door to welcome me inside. She went to work explaining the different flavours for me, that the pizza crusts are made with organic flour and available in whole wheat or white and that most of their ingredients is quality Italian ingredients (like the cheeses and meats).

There isn't a huge variety of flavours available, maybe 6 or 7, but they all sounded yummy and they're certainly not your typical Hawaiian, pep and bacon, etc. varieties. It's all thin crust and available in 8\" or 16\". I came home with the 8\" Sinora Gaga and  Verona. What I thought was unusual was that the woman added some of the ingredients to my pizza after it came out of the oven. So, the tomatoes on my Verona were fresh and not cooked and the prosciutto and whatever the sweet tasting seedy yummy things with the Sinora Gaga also came on top of the cheese.

My order with a can of Fanta came to $17.04 including GST. Yummy pizzas, and a totally lovable price on them!"}
{"text":"Gaga Pizzeria is the real deal. I'm crushing hard on their thin, crispy, baked-to-perfection crust and their fresh, generous toppings. When you walk into Gaga's, you're welcomed home and that's what makes Gaga's a staple in the Calgary pizza scene. Craving pizza is one thing, but after trying this pizza joint out you'll be craving Gaga's pizza- YUM!"}
{"text":"Signora Gaga and Mama Mia are my favorite. Excellent and speedy service. They'll have your pizza ready in 5-10 minutes. Authentic Italian crust. Love, love, love it!"}
{"text":"Gaga is an experience, a different twist on Pizza, with an obvious love of art and culture. Not to mention the friendilness and the service. ... Oh and the pizza is nice!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Signora Gaga and the Mafiosa. They were both good, not mind blowing and based on the reviews I read I guess that is what I expected. The Signora was the better of the two and I loved the figs, such a different kind of pizza I would go back for that. The Mafiosa was nothing special. They use fresh ingredients which sets them apart and you can tell they have a passion they even explain why they bake it the way they do. 

Service was outstanding, it's almost hard to not give them 5 stars because they are so friendly and kind. They also gave us free chocolate bars which was really nice. I would go back for the service alone."}
{"text":"Used to be a big fan of Sophie's and spiros, still order in from there as the best pizza I've had comes from here and they don't deliver to our neck of the woods. Thin crust classic style great service cute little spot for a few to sit inside and watch the ave. basically a take out and great pizzas! I'm sure you WILL enjoy it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best take out pizza in the neighbourhood! Their whole wheat crust is awesome and service is very friendly. I highly recommend the Signora Gaga pizza. The inside is clean, well decorated, and they even have import food stuffs for sale. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I came here based on yelp reviews... The service is excellent!!!.. Everyone is super friendly there!!.. Also, the pizzas are delicious!!.. The normal ones are great!!.. And the sweet ones are Awesome!!.. I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"During construction of the adjacent building my entire crew and most of the staff we're regulars at this Pizzeria for lunch I have returned here frequently the food is incredibly fast the vegetables the crust amazing this is one of the best pizza places in Calgary a true Hidden Gem the price is more than reasonable and I've never been disappointed."}
