{"text":"outstanding tasting hamburgers made fresh while you wait and browned natural cut French fries"}
{"text":"Great place for awesome burger and fries.  Don't forget to order your dipping sauces for the fries."}
{"text":"10$ for a 3 piece tender meal.  I got the world's smallest tenders. Definitely not worth the price. Very disappointed.  They didn't even offer to switch out tenders.."}
{"text":"Great burger, always quick helpful service.  Good for a downtown fairly inexpensive lunch.  Double burger is almost too much food.  Pro tip- add one of the extra sauces."}
{"text":"Lenny's burgers is pretty good, it's a few upgrades from Mc Donald's but not as good as SmashBurger in my opinion. The burger taste like if you were to make it on the BBQ which I like. The fries were good and the fried mushrooms. :) Will definitely get another burger if I can't get to Smash."}
{"text":"Came here about two years ago and the service was horrible  swore I'd never come back but happened to drop in today and everything was way better food was great manager/cashier was super friendly and the food was out qwik and fresh totally  changed my view of this business  kudos keep up the good work and I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Love lennys I am from Chicago so I am very picky over food. I really like those pastrami sandwiches they are the bomb especially with cheese. Nonetheless,  they have a great old school feel to the location. And the employees are very courteous.  Check it out u wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Burger was big but blah. Way too overpriced for everything. $45 for 3 adults and 1 kid. 30 cents for each side of ranch dip. I don't think we will be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"I stopped in at 4:30 pm on a Wednesday to pick up 2 burgers and 1 fry to go.  My order was ready lickity split!  The food was great.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is their napkins are kind of worthless and the staff could be much friendlier, the front counter girl seemed just indifferent."}
{"text":"A darn good burger every time! Been going here for years, and have never been let down. I love the char-broiled flavor.  Not many places grill there burgers over an open flame. The edges of the burger patties get crispy.  The bun is awesome; they toast it on the grill and the flavor of the sesame seeds come out nice and nutty in flavor.  My favorite burger in town."}
{"text":"Wow. Want a burger? Check. Want a cheap burger? Check. Want a cheap burger that taste better then those $10 burgers at big chain restaurants? Bingo. This is your spot. Lenny doesn't mess around, not one bit. He runs a tight ship here and they crank out hundreds of mouth-watering burgers every day. He knows what the people like, he knows what the people want and so he gives it to em. Don't come here looking for anything artsy or the latest burger fad, come here if you got a couple bucks on you and you want something that will hit the spot.  The homie has milkshakes too, if somehow you got room for one of them."}
{"text":"This Lenny's location is horrible. The fries appeared to have been sitting in old grease or just old. I asked if they were fresh and she indicated yes.  They were horrible. Will never eat at 5713 w. Glendale location again.  They are NOT like the other locations.. Please mark my words. They don't even deserve 1 star.  They didn't even get order correct to begin with. Had to return burger."}
{"text":"I like Lenny's but today I had a horrible meal. The fries looked old or had been sitting in grease for a long time. I asked cook if they were fresh and she said yes.  I have never been to this location and I WILL NEVER return to that location. It was very different than the others. This locations was at 57th and Glendale...yuck!  ###Giving 5 stars to the 59th and Peoria location!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Lennys on 35th and thunderbird, but this one was closer to my house. It was my first time going to this lennys and i must say i was sadly disappointed... The short girl that was at the register was being rude to some older woman that didnt know what to get. The cashier was making ugly faces and being short with her answers. I was hoping that she'd maybe treat me better since i already knew what i wanted, but she didn't. She was very rude and was trying to rush me. And on top of the rude customer service the food was decent at best. My recommendation, is to go to the Lennys on the south west marketplace on 35th and thunderbird. They have much better customer service and the food taste better as well ."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Phoenix in my opinion. I grew up with one next to my high school and I can't get enough. If you want a delicious burger and fries(best fries ever) stop here! Oh and the place itself is awesome! Who doesn't want to eat 50's style?"}
{"text":"Lenny's is so good it should be a crime. Always the best when you get great service, product and value and still get to support a local small business."}
{"text":"Due to this pregnancy, I've given up my vegetarian ways so this baby can have some extra protein! I should have known as soon as I was craving cheeseburgers, he was a boy!   I work about two blocks from here and some co-workers decided to go here for lunch one day. Cheeseburgers and milkshakes? Count me in!  I love this place! Very 50-ish with the counter and barstools. The cheeseburgers are to die for! I mean it! And they give you a heaping of fries! They also have sweet tea here, which is a bonus for me. The orders are so quick! Granted, you do come out feeling as if you can't eat again for days, but it is so worth it! Good thing there isn't one by my house or else, I would eat there more often than I do!  Definately recommend!"}
{"text":"I ate there the other day and was surprised by the quality of the food. Here are my thoughts:  Had the 2 chili dog special Chili did not taste homemade but filled the tops of the dogs Dogs themselves were tasty and had a snap to them Fries were hot and nicely salted  Come on down for a good meal at a good price. I would eat here again. Thanks"}
{"text":"Horrible, I will never go back to this place. Tried the gyro's and I couldn't even finish mine, the sauce they put on it tasted like soap and the meat was not even juicy was hard and tasted like old frozen put in microwave and serve. The place stinks, its hot in there, don't waste any of your money."}
{"text":"we are a big fan of retro diners and burger shops, and the decor caught our attention, so we decide to try it out. the menu looked promising and the prices weren't bad at all, so we were pretty gosh-darned excited.  however, the food sucked. a lot. i got a teriyaki burger and it was gross. the sauce was lame and the mushrooms were, like, canned or something that you would find at burger king or some other shitpile. my lady got the veggie burger and she said it was just ok. but, it was cold, so that's dumb. also the gravy on the side (which cost 60 annoying cents) looked like poop in cat litter. the fries were good though, so this place gets 2 stars for that and the sweet interior."}
{"text":"Great burgers, good price, great friendly staff.  Try the Mexican Burger (not spicy)"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, had to deduct one star because they charge for condiments... Grow up."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I always meet up here for Fish and Chips every Christmas. It is a tradition and I must say the tartar sauce is AMAZING. I have not tried the burgers, but the fish and chips are worth the trip. I don't pay much mind to the place itself (Because it is in old town Glendale and all the buildings are very old). The service is very nice in its own dignified sort of way. I can respect that. Never change your fish and chips, it is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Plain Awesome! Good old fashioned burger joint, great burgers and fries and awesome shakes! The guy working the counter treats everyone like his best friend service beyond expectation with food to match. I get the country burger ordered medium and a Pb and chocolate shake. Cures any and all hangovers :)"}
{"text":"Ahh, Lenny's. That super ghetto string of burger joints in Phoenix which just happens to have the best burger in the valley. Certainly better than the shithole in Tempe known as Ted's.   Wait, the one on Thomas & Central isn't ghetto, is in fact super nice, and has an awesome 5 & Diner type theme? Lies.   To my delight, it was true. When my work moved here I had to try it right away. This Lenny's is extremely clean, inviting, and has a great atmosphere. As always, the food is superb. They have a pretty extensive burger menu with the best items being the plain old single, double, triple, and Mexican burgers. They give you a ton of options for each burger order on top of that. They also have shakes, onion rings, a bunch of other appetizer type foods, and a very simple combo structure for each type of burger. Perhaps even more notable is that Lenny's is cheap. You can come out of there with a very filling meal for $4-7.  Supposedly this place gets packed in during lunch due to all of the office buildings in the area. I don't go during that time so it's hard for me to say. I do know that they recently expanded the seating area. Available space should be a bit more than double what it was before, so if the crowd was always a deal breaker don't be afraid to try again. Otherwise, I usually go after about 4PM and the place is completely dead.  The only bad things I can say about this Lenny's is that the hours aren't too great and it cannot accommodate groups. Every dining table is tiny and Lenny's has a 7PM closing time on a weekday. This is pretty common for most eateries around Thomas & Central. Hell, the Best of Philly across the street from Lenny's closes at 4PM every day which is a fucking joke.  Oh, also, get the Jalapeno Chili Cheese Fries. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"So this place used to be Lenny's , now it is Moes burgers. Terrible. The place smelled like sewage, and I got a whiff of marijuana while placing my order(no joke). Not to mention the man taking my order had a coke nail. When we got our food the fries we almost burned in really really old oil. I couldn't eat them. The burger was ok, but poor quality beef. Also could not finish that. My burger had gristle in it.  I've been here before when it was Lenny's, but I won't be coming back to moes. Take the extra five minute drive and go to the actual Lenny's further east on Glendale (&I17)"}
{"text":"Great lunch place for a burger, fries and a coke. Fast service, friendly staff, 50s diner atmosphere, clean. Recommend the Cowboy burger if you're in the mood to indulge. My 'go to' burger place in this locale."}
{"text":"The best Lenny's Burger Shop in town, under separate ownership than the other Lenny's around town this one has Coca-Cola and much better tasting food."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of the reviews, my expectations were pretty high.  I'm a pretty big burger lover, will even order one in a fancy restaurant if I think it'll be good in that particular place.  The burger was \"ok,\" a disappointment compared to what I thought I'd be getting.  In fact, it tasted EXACTLY like Burger King.  It even looked like a Burger King hamburger (which in my opinion is not good at all).  The fries were delicious, plentiful and seasoned very nicely.  They did their job quite well.  The interior of the restaurant is fun, light-hearted 50's retro diner for sure. It's a good time to look at the pics on the wall.  They put a lot into the look of the place and it shows.   Also, the staff was fast and helpful and my order was ready in no time at all (and I was there during lunch rush!).  So, in all - a good lunch place for cheap and a fun dining experience.  But don't drive all the way down here for the burgers if you live far away.  They are average at best.  Frankly, if you're up for driving and want a good burger, you're better off at FatBurger (Mill ave) or try the burger at Jilly's up in Scottsdale (very good)."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic Rueben sandwich! Very hot cheese was gooey and wonderful in all the right ways. The lady that took my order was very nice. But, this place is pricey! I can go eat sushi for the price of a sandwich. Atmosphere was fun. Music was great. The price was the only negative I had."}
{"text":"Best Fries in Town. Very hot, crispy, not greasy. The Best. The double chese burger was good too, almost too big to bite!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 25yrs. Food was better when it was owned by Lenny but I think it still deserves 5 stars. Beats any other fast food joint. Layout is kinda strange and it's always hot inside but its worth it for the food."}
{"text":"The hamburger remind me of how my parents made hamburgers! Better be hungry because these burgers are big! Its worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Dropped off my nephew at Grand Canyon university and had to stop by after pumping at Costco. Only burger joint in the area so we thought we would give it a try. I come from Los Angeles and this was the worst burger place I have been too. I ordered chicken burger and my friend ordered the cheeseburger. No flavor was very un satisfying just by appearance but we were hungry. Reading these other reviews, is surprising, how good people brag about this place."}
{"text":"If you're near Central & Thomas you MUST try this place!  I'm in love with their menu.  They have everything from burgers to delicious hot dogs.    You can even get burritos in the morning. Yes... So good.  Service is always fast and quality if food is always up to par.  I'm loving the Mexican burger!  It had green chile and grilled onions... Man I'm hungry just writing about it.  Try everything!!!! Won't disappoint. ;)"}
{"text":"I've been here once since moving into the neighborhood. Good burgers at a good price. I am not a big meat eater but, this burger was really good. I will be going back again with my hubby."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, buns are toasted.....jalapeno cheese fries are amazing.    Smaller place, not much seating"}
{"text":"I've been a long-time lover of Lenny's for several reasons.  1) Single best cheese fries outside of Wisconsin. 2) Adorably retro 3) Around the corner from my place of employment.  The customer service is equally delightful."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. Fantastic! And costs about the same as Jack in the Crack. Try the Mexican burger ( Green chilis, grilled onions,  hite and yellow American cheeses)."}
{"text":"I have yet to have anything from Lenny's that wasn't outright delicious. The fries are absolutely amazing. The only downside, which may actually be a positive, is that it is really busy during lunch time and there isn't much parking. Other than that, it's one of my favorite burger shops and the prices are really good."}
{"text":"We see Lenny's all the time on Central and finally made it a point to go in. Sorry we waited so long to eat here. It is the best burger we have had in a very long time. I was adventurous and had the Cowboy burger. FANTASTIC! Cheese, BBQ sauce, bacon on a true all beef burger. No wimpy size or microwave burger.  Fresh and delicious.   Best part of the visit was the owner and his team. Everyone that came in was greeted and made to feel like family. Don't wait, go to Lenny's!"}
{"text":"Tried this a few weeks ago and ever since had a hankering to get back for more. Only problem is their stupid hours... Who closes at 7PM on the weekdays, 2PM on saturday, and isn't open on Sunday? Guess when you're sitting on a gold mine you can do what you want...  Burgers are big and sloppy and awesome. That's really all there is to say. Decor is kinda cool, I posted pics if you want to see some.   Food is cheap and fast, a big plus. Its right off the Thomas and Central Lite Rail stop, so if you're looking for good eats, Lenny's is a good stop! Only problem is the hours, but hell if I was old Lenny, I'd need some time for golf too."}
{"text":"This good sixties type  Burger dinner. At a very fair pricing!"}
{"text":"Lenny's is more like a 60s Burger Joint everything is cooked to order I like that a lot. The burger the hotdog the root beer floats and the shakes are all the kind of things you remember in the early burger joints. The cost is very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"We walked into the place not really knowing what to expect, and after ordering? i hopped onto yelp and it was pretty much as i thought: little hospitality from the employee's. music doesn't quite fit the atmosphere, and when we sat at the bar, we put a little pressure ( just enough to adjust yourself to sit on the stool) and almost RIPPED the bar table off! as for the food, would i pay for another polish dog like that for $4? that's a no. pickles feel plastic. no other comment."}
{"text":"Let me be clear:  Best Burger in Arizona!   Lenny's is a 50s style dinner that serves the most delicious burger in Phoenix that I have yet to experience. The counter and barstools perfect the theme of the place and allow for customers to watch the cooks prepare the burgers or dogs.  The fries are delicious, too.  And it is one of the cheapest places to eat in downtown Phoenix.  And often times, Lenny himself is there taking your order.  I HIGHLY recommend Lenny's to any burger lover.  It will not disappoint.  And they just recently doubled the size of the place!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers around, if not the best. Has a great old school dinner feel. Minimal seating inside with plenty of tables outside making it a great location for a late dinner outside.  After a great burger, desert is also great here. Definitely worth a trip but be warned, the food is addicting"}
{"text":"We were attending Glendale Glitters to celebrate Christmas and we were looking for a place to eat. Lenny's Burger Shop was perfect! A classic mom-and-pop, non-chain restaurant. The place was busy but the service was still friendly and pleasant. As for the burgers - grilled and delicious. The patty filled the entire bun. We knew they were delicious the moment we bit into them. The fries were homemade as well - not something from the freezer. Full burger meal was $7.25."}
{"text":"So, I was working in the area and passed this place on the way to lunch at the neighboring Subway. Saw the Yelp decal in the window and was further intrigued by the neat retro decor and busy, vibrant atmosphere, and decided to give it a shot.....and I'm glad I did!  Despite a pronounced lunchtime crowd, the line to order moved quickly enough that I barely had enough time to check out the menu. Went for the safe bet of a double cheeseburger combo and then added the 2 for $2 chili coney dogs on as a shameful impulse purchase, haha. The staff members taking and then serving my order were friendly and courteous despite the frantic pace of the lunch rush.   I typically eat pretty light dying the week, especially at lunch, so this glutonous meal was a major departure that'll require some extra time in the gym to work off, but so worth it. Coneys were quite good despite being the 'special' and even though I couldn't finish them, they were so cheap it didn't matter, lol, fries were outstanding and perfect doneness, but the real treat was the burger. Large, loaded with \"everything\", dripping with melted cheese, and what a flavor. Easily one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"After waiting in the drive-through for 15 minutes I just drove off.  The food looked good, but I didn't get to try it."}
{"text":"I'm giving this two stars because the food is good. It is also reasonably priced. It is much better than fast food and not even much more. However, don't come here for good service. The lady at the counter has been rude to me every time I have come in. Even friends of mine have said she's been rude. I've been in the food and restaurant industry as well as management and if she was even half as nasty to me as she has been I would fire her on the spot. It's unacceptable to treat customers this way and a great way to lose business. Also their website is inconsistent with what they actually have. Basic stuff here. I'll try my luck at another location, perhaps."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!!! I don't understand how anyone likes these burgers or fries. I got a single combo. I wanted to upgrade to cheese fries, but I was told I had to purchase all separately to get cheese fries. Ok??? I just added on a side of cheese. I'm pretty sure they just ran across the street to Burger King because it tasted just like their burgers. Thin meat, oversized bun. Fries were soggy and over salted. I was excited to try this little burger joint as I live to support little food joints like this. However, I was very disappointed. Will not return."}
{"text":"A little tid bit most of you don't know, when I was growing up, I was nick named \"Neil Burger\" Got this tile for eating the 1 LB burger at Tractons in LA when I was 7 years old.  Well I have found a match, you have gourmet burgers, fast food burgers, even veggie burgers but these guys have it done right.  Soft Buns that hold up to the fixings (Don't get Soggy) Flavorful meat 80/20 most likely. A price that makes McDonald's look expensive! If you love burgers of old, and really want the best burger for your buck, get to Lenny's and have a bite of heaven wrapped in paper, the old fashioned way!"}
{"text":"I will never go to this place again. I ordered my food and the employee at the register tells me the burger will come with american cheese. She then asked me if that was ok. I asked what other types they have and I selected on pepper jack. After I left the restaurant, I noticed she had charged me extra for the substituted cheese. How classless can this place be to ask me if I want a substitute and then not even disclose that it cost me more. Had the employee disclosed it to me, I would not have substituted. I hate when a greasy spoon restaurant nickel and dime their customers like this."}
{"text":"We've been here in Glendale for two days, and have been here twice.  That says enough in my mind, but I'll add more.  Burgers...AWESOME.  Fries, Great!  Atmosphere.  Great."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!  Hot dogs-great; onion rings-great; chili cheese fries-great; 50 cent soft serve cones-awesome.  Just want to add that so far there hasn't been anything that we've tried here that we haven't liked."}
{"text":"I love Lenny's burgers! They are always speedy and have great burgers! Fantastic place to have lunch during work."}
{"text":"Terrible experience with Luis at the restaurant. He was rude and told me never to come back because I complain too much. I made 1 complaint about him preparing my food wrong the previous Sat.  He said to come in any day the next week and he'd replace the food. When I came in he told me he had voided my receipt and never charged me. I showed him proof of the charges and he threw $2 at me and told me to never come back. I asked for a number to contact the manager/owner. Nobody working would provide it to me. I called the Lennys on Indian School to have them relay the info to the correct owner. Still no response from the owner of the central location. Terrible customer service and I had been a regular customer. So disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  The burger was perfectly grilled.  I would definitely go back again to Lenny's when I'm in town."}
{"text":"The guy behind the counter said I was going to like their burgers WOW was he right !this place rocks... definitely no corporate assembly line pre cooked  feel here .They are even better then  restaurant burgers & fries in my opinion & lets not forget the whole dive feel they have going without trying  5 STARS BECAUSE I CANT GIVE 6"}
{"text":"No fresh ingredients at all. Mushrooms are obviously canned. How someone could rate a burger place high that doesn't do cook to order burgers is ridiculous. Might as well go to McDONALD'S.  Fries are terrible too"}
{"text":"I was on a 30 mile urban sidewalk bike ride and decided I needed energy.  I stopped in at Lenny's on Central. The wait staff at Lenny's was fantastic and very cordial. The guy who made my shake said \"We call it The Beast\" as it is 32oz of rich, thick, heavenly, goodness. It was my first and he knew it. He affectionately recollected his first Beast and recommended the peanut butter addition. When he handed it to me, he insinuated that I'd be back for more. I said \" I hope I'm not here early in the morning banging on your door\". He said \"I'll let you in\". :)  A great experience and a fantastic chocolate peanut butter Beast of a shake."}
{"text":"We came here for a quick and easy lunch, and sure enough, within about 3 minutes of ordering, our burgers were ready. This was my first time coming here and if I ever come back to Phoenix, I might consider stopping by. I ordered the Buffalo Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It wasn't actually shown on the menu, but a TV had displayed this option which sparked my interest. The burger itself was very good: the chicken was cooked nicely, although I'm not sure it was as crispy as I would like it to have been. I'm a sweet tea fanatic so I have to mention the sweet tea as well, which was pretty average and could have been WAY better. I only took about 10 sips or so. Overall, I would recommend Lenny's for a quick burger with a lot of selections for fries. This place stays true to what they are, so if you're looking for a place to blow your mind, this may not be it."}
{"text":"Portions here are large! The burgers are huge. The double cheese burger is big and tasty, the mushroom burger is tasty but a little too messy! The fries are good as well. The friend who ordered the peanut butter shake raved about it. All in all a good value for the price."}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting more. If you go to their website, you will get a site for Lenny's Burgers that is NOT associated with this location. So you may be misled.   This place is a small (seats 8 along the window) snack stand. Similar to the snack bars at sporting events. They had 2 picnic tables outside.The day we went there it was smokey from the exhaust fan not working well. It was hot and greasy and claustraphobic inside. In 2 seconds we agreed to make this a take out order.   On the plus side, the burgers were good but you have to pay for each topping except condiments, lettuce and tomato. The lettuce was sparcely distributed. My wife had a chicken salad that I could have made at home."}
{"text":"Good Old Lenny's Burger Shop! I have enjoyed this place for years now and I can't get a enough of it.  However, my one criticism is that after I order my burger, fries, and shake.. my bill is double or triple the price if I were to go to a regular fast food place..  I guess you get what you pay for, but it does limit the amount of times I get to satisfy my taste buds through a delicious Lenny Burger!   Overall, great place and they are expanding throughout the valley, so it makes it easier to get my grub on.  Give this place a try if you want a good burger cooked in front of you. Don't forget the fries and shake though!"}
{"text":"Never Again. I live around the corner, and this is usually my staple for a fast burger, but I refuse to put up with the bad service.   I ordered one of their specialty burgers, and when I was confused about why the girl behind the counter kept asking if I wanted ingredients that didn't go on the burger I ordered, she actually chastised me for it, saying that I ordered wrong!  Then, they made my husband a milkshake with milk that had been sitting out for at least the 20 minutes we sat there. The food went into the trash and we will NOT be back."}
{"text":"It's a good, honest burger.  I don't have much beyond that.  The place has a very un-corporate atmosphere.  Not retro for the sake of fooling you into thinking it's retro.  Just classic, all on its own."}
{"text":"Why does everyone rave about this place? The burgers are about the same as a fast food place. The fries are not fresh as advertised but made from prepackaged frozen bags. It took one minute to get my burger. Yet the place is busy. A better burger joint is Wood Flame Burgers."}
{"text":"Decent food, cheap prices, somebody obviously cares about this business.  Employees seem to be happy, like working there.  Only thing is the Chicago dog wasn't authentic--no sport peppers, celery salt, the relish wasn't right.  Still tasted good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Lenny's was OK but nothing to write home about.  Since I am a vegetarian I decided to stop in because I heard they had a veggie burger.  I assumed that a Burger Shop would be able to pull off a bad-ass veggie burger but I was wrong. The burger, fries, and drink cost me a little over $7.00 thankfully the fries were good."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try this place for a while.  I love a good burger.  It is one of my favorite foods.  It took me a while because like most local downtown-midtown restaurants it closes early.  Hours are 8am - 7pm Monday to Friday. Sucks closed on the weekend.  I work a lot so I usually get out of work late.  I had the Mexican burger without mayonnaise.  I dis-like mayonnaise on burgers and sandwiches.  I find it rather appalling.  The only time I have mayonnaise is when it plays a minor role in potato salad or if it is fresh made aioli.   Sorry my mind tends to wander.  Back to the burger!!  They reason they call it a Mexican burger is because of the green chilies.  I believe them  to be a New Mexico Hatch chilies.  Don't be scared of the word chili if you don't know Hatch green chilies are very mild.  It was also cheesy and greasy which are the sign of a good burger.  The fry's were crisp and delicious. Fry's are another one of my favorite foods, which I don't like to share with people.  So if I go out to eat with somebody I tell them they better order their own basket.    They also have great desserts.  I had a banana split.  The only issue I have is that their root beer floats are made with Mug root beer because they serve Pepsi products.  Mug is the worst root beer I have ever had.  The best thing about this place is that it is very reasonable priced.  To order one of their burger combos with fry's and a 32 ounce drink goes for: $4.99 to $6:99.  It is always cool to find a cheap cool hang out because I am very frugal.    The restaurant is located in a strip mall on the southeast corner of Thomas & Central.  It is easy to spot because  it has huge neon signs in the windows.  When you go inside is when you feel as you have stepped into a 50's dinner in a stand alone building.  It has diamond pattered stainless steel panels all over the walls.  Which honestly is a little dis-orientating but cool.  Also, with red table tops, red benches and metal chairs.  Plus a lot more 50's decor.  I will definitely be going often.  I guess I will have to sneak out of work early or take a long lunch break to go there."}
{"text":"Lenny burger used to be so good. We would drive 1/2 hr to go there. We went back today and it was not good at all.  The onion rings were breaded with no flavor and looked like they came straight from the freezer. The burger was so salty. The patty was small and overcooked.   I got BBQ sauce and it did not taste good at all. Plus the cost. Holy cow- over $30 for 3 burgers, one order of fries, one order of onion rings and 2 shakes? Yikes!  I think even the burger king across the street would have been better."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  How awesome is Lenny! He has been  working in his family business for 30 years! You can find him taking orders and helping his staff.   He is so friendly and courteous to everyone that walks through the door! You can't help but enjoy the great atmosphere and if your in the mood for a down home burger or fries, this is your place! :)"}
{"text":"Don't bother with this location!!! Save yourself the frustration, aggravation and save ur tastebuds. The staff is rude. The food is over cooked. The milkshakes were runny. No free refills and only half the menu of the original.  :(:(:(:(:(   If u want the REAL  taste and atmosphere of Lenny's go to the original at 59th Ave. & Peoria!!!!"}
{"text":"Went today, and had a well done Cowboy burger. The fries were absolutely excellent, along with a good sized drink and the burger tasted phenomenal. Service was clear and concise. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for some good (slightly salty) food!"}
{"text":"Ohh my gosh... If you think you've had the best hamburger of your life. Slow yourself down and go to Lenny's and get yourself a burger and you'll never look at hamburger the same ever again. I always get a bacon single patty with BBQ sauce and Thousand Island. Filled w grilled onions and green chiles. These are the best combination you can get in a Lenny's burger. You won't regret it. If you're not happy w your meal, save it for me and I'll finish it ! :-)"}
{"text":"I typically would give this place five stars but I am extremely disappointed in the service I received today. I am a Unsweetened Iced Tea drinker and after tasting the glass I dispensed myself it wasn't the regular tea it it was sweetened. I stopped an employee and told her that there was something wrong with the tea she then told me NO that the sweet and regular tea were separate and walked away. She never addressed the issue I even went up there a second time to ask about it and she was more concerned with chatting with the other employees there."}
{"text":"Quality, super super juicy, tender, original burgers. The patties are thick and super juicy. They are flame broiled which adds a crisp on the sides of the pattie and adds a slight light char taste. The buns are super soft and the sesame seeds on it have a toasty flavor brought out from being put on the grill. It was a super authentic burger. A burger that you want to take your time eating because it's so good. The burgers are a bigger size, no small little slider size. If I want an original burger this is the place that comes to mind. Just the one double burger itself was super satisfying and filling. I am definitely coming again."}
{"text":"This is my guilty pleasure food! And it doesn't help that it's only 2 minutes from work. If I'm having a bad day, a ranch burger (extra ranch) and onion rings from Lenny's makes it all better! To top it all off, the staff is wonderful and so friendly! Love love love!"}
{"text":"This place is nestled in a strip mall close to a Subway. The decor is 50's diner and the food is great. I have only been once but will go again. The burgers were delicious with the right amount of everything. My friend got a milkshake and was gleaming over it. I would recommend this place to anyone that is in the area. However, I doubt it is very heart healthy so beware if you are on a special diet."}
{"text":"Great old fashioned burger shop"}
{"text":"Great food, kind of expensive, smells like birds, staff is ok. Food makes up for any shortcomings, also eat outside or home"}
{"text":"I had the chicken strips combo with a strawberry shake, it was delicious! Chicken was great, fries even better and their shake was amazing. Just as good as In-N-Outs shakes. Can't wait to go back. Sweet potato fries are also extremely good."}
{"text":"Patty melts are AMAZING!! I love coming here. Food and service are great, I make it a point to sneak away to eat here once a week ;)"}
{"text":"Nice little bugler joint. The server was very upbeat and the service was fast. There were a lot of interesting options on the menu but I figured I would order a cheeseburger to be safe. It looked great but unfortunately I was a bit dissapointed.  Too bad because the condiments were fresh, the fries were hot but the patty was NOT. It was cooked ok but it looks like they pre-cook them. At least throw them on the grill to heat up so the meat is warm and the cheese is melted or better yet cook it to order."}
{"text":"Good burgers, better shakes and amazing chili dogs.  Ask for #10 which is 2 chili dogs and fries with a drink.  Before warned this may put u into a food coma."}
{"text":"Best veggie burger in down town Phoenix, nothing comes close! Try it with pepper jack cheese & jalapeño's! Their home made ranch is one of the best I've tasted. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time since I was in the neighborhood and I'm so glad I did! I was helped by the owner, Lenny, himself! What a nice and friendly guy! He was so helpful. I didn't know what to get so he suggested the classic burger that came with onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes and a sauce of your choice. The Lenny's sauce is the bees knees! Definitely get that to dip your fries in. The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were hot and crispy. A huge portion for just over $8! Definitely recommend this place to all burger lovers."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out a few days ago and to be honest not impressed. I've eaten at plenty of burger joints across the U.S. This is probably one of the worst. It has the classic look of a burger place, set up is pretty nice but the key points are the food. The employees didn't care much just doing the job said nothing and actually checked my ID when using my credit card for like 8 bucks which isn't a big deal but still odd.  Anyways my cowboy burger came and the meat was dry, lettuce and tomatoes didn't seem very fresh, it was very bland burger. The fries were decent though so ill give them that. Needless to say go elsewhere for a burger."}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint near where I live. If there were a 5 Guys near here, that would be a different story. However, things being what they are, I truly enjoy this place.  They have great fries, and the ranch mayo is super delicious as well as the fry sauce. Try them! They cost extra, but it's worth it. I really enjoy the burgers too. Nice and juicy, made to order. Yummy! I really don't get to eat here often (I used to eat here several times a week), it's a great place to splurge."}
{"text":"First, after placing our order we had to wait 5 minutes to pay and for our drinks and there was no one in front of us. Second, my family and I waited over 20 minutes for our order. My husband had to honk his horn to get their attention to see what was taking so long for our order (we ordered 2 number #1s and 1 number 2 w/ no onions). We saw cars on the other side leaving a lot quicker than us. We were told to wait 3 MORE minutes for our fries!! I wanted to just get a refund at this point but my husband said since we already paid we would wait. When we got our food the lady was rude and to top it off our food was cold AND there is no way those fries were fresh. We are understanding when eating out that at times things take longer now and then but to have to wait with BAD customer service and COLD food ensures that we will never go back here again."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Their zucchini is very good and you can't beat the flame grilled burgers. BUT for $22.00 (two hamburgers and fries with one drink) the cashier was rude AND even after she wrote down my order, they still messed it up. She wrote down all the toppings I wanted and I got a plain burger. The burger was under cooked amd pink when I said well done and the bun was burnt. We were the only people in the restaurant. So there was no rush. Never could understand people who take a job with the public and have no people skills. Disappointed. For the price I paid.... the food was not good."}
{"text":"Best gluten free burger-EVER! Brought 20 MoeZart Production folks with us and every burger, shake, and fries were fantastic! Definitely will be back!!!"}
{"text":"It depends which Location.  The Lennys on Glendale & right after 27th AVE now that's where you get the good and juicy burgers at every time.  They are flavored just right and they are the best you will ever get from anywhere.  But as for the other Lennys, a total let down they are not the same nor up to par."}
{"text":"I had heard this place made good burgers from a friend and they were right. I like the them a lot more than an most fast food."}
{"text":"After hearing reports of this place (all of which were good) I decided to bring a couple of friends along. Service was fast but unfortunately my burger was a bit undercooked. So while everyone else was enjoying their food, I couldn't finish mine. I hope to come back again and get the experience my colleagues had. As for now, I was far from impressed."}
{"text":"So we ended up moving right around the way from this great little place. I am so glad we did. Customer service is good. I feel like I am visiting new family when coming here. The food is off the hook. I believe my family and I have had the opportunity of trying most of the menu items."}
{"text":"This place is thee best little dinning burger place in Phoenix,Az. Have not live in Az for long. But running into this place was so awesome. My family and I totally love the food,pricing is good,taste is outstanding. Great job to all that work there.  BTW: We don't live in the city,but we make it a point to visit as often as possible."}
{"text":"We work fairly close to this place, and used to go once a week. However, the  cook Luis made my burger wrong and when I asked for a new one be made he just yelled at me, made it again and then yelled to never come back again. What a jerk. Don't worry I won't ever be back because this place doesn't care about their customers. Buyer be aware."}
{"text":"Lenny's Burger Shop provided a decent lunch for me although the food was not quite as good as I expected.  The restaurant is neat, but feels rather cramped on the inside since it is very small and there are not a lot of tables. It is kind of cool in a way though.  The burger is far from the best you have had as are the fries, but kudos to Lenny's for keeping prices reasonable. Compared to places I have been to like this I thought the prices here were great, so if I come back it will be for that reason."}
{"text":"The average All-American burgers. The last time we came here was about 5 years ago and the experience and taste didn't change. This time we went during Glendale Glitters and it was very crowded, we pretty much competed for a table. Haha. The restaurant is incredibly small so I would advise to go on a weekday or non-holiday. We ordered the country burger. It was good. Honestly, it's nothing super fancy. We were just in the mood for one of those traditional burgers and fries. I would come here again."}
{"text":"A Great little 50's diner. A hole in the wall mom and pop's joint. Have been eating there since Lenny himself would cook the burgers.  The fries are amazing and the burgers are to die for. I get the ranch burger with jalapenos and cheese.   Classic food for a good price, better than chain fast food restaurants. Good for low-key dates"}
{"text":"Been awhile since I've eaten here, so I ate here today and it is still one of the best burgers in town!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated it's just frozen hockey pucks. Plain as plain can get. Friendly service but very unclean. How do you mess up a burger."}
{"text":"Being from California I certainly miss these old hamburger restaurants. Also being vegetarian doesn't help things either. Lenny's fills that void perfectly. They have one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. Prepared in the old fashioned style that I've become used to. Big white bun, shredded iceberg lettuce and tons of thousand Island dressing. The fries are amazing too. This place is a gem. Not all vegetarian food is bad!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this while suffering from mild food poisoning: The service there was terrible today when my wife and I went to get dinner. The cashier was rude when my wife asked to order her burger without certain toppings (nothing unreasonable). I ordered a chocolate shake, which they forgot to make. When we waited for them to make it, I saw that they used a blender that had been sitting out with whatever was blended in it before. The milk they used for the shake was also sitting out for who knows how long as well. When she handed me the shake, I walked out to my car without having it and threw it in the garbage. I only had a few bites of my chicken sandwich and it was stale and drenched in too much mayo. Assuming the mayo and chicken was sitting out like the blender, it's no surprise I now feel pretty ill.   We'll never be back and tell all of our friends that also live downtown to avoid Lenny's. Disgusting and disappointing."}
{"text":"So not the Lenny's I remember! What happened to good food at fair prices? Hadn't been in a long while and should of listened to my daughter about how expensive they've gotten. After getting over the sticker shock and realizing, I should of drove my butt over to Rocket Burgers and Subs, I ordered a couple dipping sauces to add to our order at the window, which the girl was going to just give us but then decided she needed to charge us the measly 30 cents each, just in case she was being watched. Lol. Drive all the way home looking forward to the ranch my daughter says is awesome....and no dipping sauces in site. When it was all said and done, for the cost of our two meals, we could of easily gone to a sit down restaurant and had someone wait on us. Well, now I understand why the girl in the window doesn't give you a total until your actually at the window. You got me this once, but never again!"}
{"text":"**I inadvertently placed this review at the wrong Lenny's previously, my apologies**  This review is as of October 13, 2012.  I walked in on a whim, I was really in the mood for a burger. The decor for the restaurant is a let down and the lack of personality from the employees didn't raise the bar.  I ordered their country burger combo which came with a large drink and fries. The total came close to $10. When I pay double digits for a burger I expect good quality. The food came out promptly and I immediately dug into my fries. They were hot but very limp.  The fries had the skins on them, which I enjoy, but they had no flavor and very little salt on them. I salted them on my own to add some flavor. I don't normally dip my fries in ketchup, but this time I had to.    The soda was not sweet and basically tasted like carbonated water. I ended up switching sodas and that didn't fare any better. The 50 cent refill charge I thought was kinda ludicrous.  So far things aren't going so well, but I'm still excited about my burger. I got the double patty burger, which are still sadly, very thin. The meat itself had no flavor. The only thing that distinguished it from anything else is the taste of the char. The thousand island dressing on the burgers was very thin and runny. It had no flavor whatsoever. The burger was bland overall. I asked for it to be cooked medium as their sign states they cook meat to order. There was no hint of pink on the patties.  Sad lunch experience and I doubt I will ever return to Lenny's based on today's experience."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Their jumbo hotdogs are really good.  The French fries are naturally cut.  They have simple and delicious nachos.  Go and try this place out.  You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Way better than any FAST FOOD BIG NAMES!!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I've had in years! The staff knows little or nothing about American Classic foods and how such items are supposed to taste or look. While the place has the decor' of a classic 50's burger joint (as seen when channeling Johnny Rockets perhaps) there is where any authenticity ends.    What was wrong?  The chili Dogs were smothered in something that looked like melted Velveta  artificial cheese sauce, the franks were low quality and seriously overcooked, and the miserable onions on top looked stale! The chili itself was a few beans with some ground beef and tomato sauce, no doubt out of (yet) another can!  We also had a couple of milkshakes. Tasty-Freeze instant-mix ice-cream which of course contains little, if any milk or cream. The chocolate flavoring used was Hershey's. But even authentic chocolate flavoring couldn't save the soft-serve pseudo ice-cream from being far too sugary. However the seaweed used for thickener in it was almost edible. Almost - but not quite.  Oh, and we paid extra of course for a batch of \"Onion Rings\".  I do not know whether they had any flavor of their own or not. Underneath the too-thick batter, we didn't see any onion in about 1/2 of them. Then to make matters worse, they were fried in oil that should have been changed a couple of days (or weeks) back. Rancid oil is not a nice flavor and is no substitute for onions in onion rings. Or am I being too picky? Me thinks not!  I am banging out this review some 20 minutes after leaving \"Lenny's Burger Shop\" in the sincere hope I can save the rest of you from a wretched and terribly disappointing experience. My partner is en route to Circle K to get some Alka Seltzer - because we both feel as though we're going to be sick very soon. After that badly prepared and ultra low quality food, maybe it's better to get it out of our systems as soon as possible.   BTW: our check for two chili dogs, one order of something called \"onion rings\", and one small chocolate shake and one medium chocolate shake came to almost $22 Dollars. The counter help serves NOTHING. You place your order and it's thrust across the counter toward you when it's ready.  But of course they were expecting to be tipped.  For what I wondered?  But tip I did. A couple of bucks out of pity for their working in such a place.  Poor creatures. I hope they do not have to eat there as part of their compensation!  In short, the place needs to be on your \"DO NOT GO THERE IF YOU'RE STARVING\" list.  These people do not know what American Classic Cuisine should look like or should taste like. Everything they served us came out of a can or the freezer and they do not keep the fat in their fryers changed often enough to avoid imparting a definite rancid oil taste to anything that is immersed in it.  If you have someone you truly dislike, send them to Lenny's Burger Shop!  But for heaven's sake, do not take them there. You might be forced to eat some of their offerings yourself!"}
{"text":"Almost like an old fashion Whopper to me, yes, a Burger King burger. If I were in a blind folded taste test I would have thought it was a really good Whopper. I've heard so much about this place from the locals but There was nothing significant about it in my opinion. The prices were fair, the burger was less than fair. Haven't been back since, have no plans on visiting again."}
{"text":"Got the half lb. ranch burger. It was good. Don't. See what the big hype is over"}
{"text":"I ordered the mushroom swiss burger.  The fries were cooked well and the burger was on the unseasoned side.  It did look appealing and the service was good."}
{"text":"Real quick update. They now offer sweet potato fries as a free alternative to their regular fries. I decided to go with them today to accompany my teriyaki burger instead of the norm, and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Love the look old dinner style. This place is good, I always saw this place when driving and decided to give it a try and it was worth it. The burgers are simple and delicious.  They have a different types of burgers and other food.  Will definitely come back in the future"}
{"text":"Great service, knows me by now as Turkey Dog Combo gal:) It's hard to find Turkey dogs in this town & lucky enough this one is close to me! Great prices $5.25 for a great lunch served with love & a smile."}
{"text":"A great place to go for some good old fashion burgers. The place gives you that 1950s diner cafe experience. The food are simple yet delicious. I saw a family of 5 come in to have dinner and they seemed to enjoy their time."}
{"text":"There are some burgers that focus on the best possible meat. There are others that focus on having a great bun, or interesting ingredients. Some places, like Relish, seem to understand how important balance is, and really push to make sure it's a perfect bite. The pastrami burger was the one I chose and was not disappointed.The meat was a nice, juicy and when combined with the fresh toppings it made for surprisingly light taste. The service was friendly and the menu was simple. It looks and feels like a small town dinner. If your feeling like leaving the diet behind Lenny's is the place. Burger up."}
{"text":"I've been by Lenny's many times, but it wasn't until a friend recommended meeting there for lunch that I decided to give it a try. Very glad we did! We went the first time, and several times since, in the afternoon.   We usually order a double Western Burger and the Grilled Chicken Salad. Both are delicious!! The burger is cooked to order. It comes with BBQ sauce and onion rings. The combo comes with fries and a drink. Fries are thick cut and fresh. The salad is what I get. It is one of my favorites! It has shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, green olives, red onion, american cheese, peppers and fresh grilled chicken. I have gone back a few times just for this salad.   Each time we've been there the service has been very good. The staff is pleasant and quick to get things made. There is the main area that you enter and order at the counter. It is a bit small. After you order, you can go back outside and through another door to a dining area with booths. They also have picnic tables out front depending on the time of year.  Prices are on par with most places. We have an Entertainment coupon that we usually use. For the combo and a salad with a $5 off coupon, we spend under $10. This is a favorite lunch stop for us!"}
{"text":"One word.....frozen. Frozen patties, frozen fries, frozen onion rings. Nothing tasted at all fresh which was a huge disappointment. The burger patties, which had no...flavor...at...all, were apparently precooked and pulled from a drawer and tossed on the grill just long enough to barely melt the processed cheese on top (my wife watched this from our booth). The grilled onions were skinny little wisps of red onions...sorry, but where I come from grilled onions are white or yellow \"adult\" onions of some substance that you can be proud of and actually taste. The heavily battered onion rings smelled and tasted like fish so obviously the grease was in a shared pond...plus they were very greasy. The fries were not bad but they were the same frozen fries you can pull off at home in the oven.   Nice decor, cute decorations, friendly enough staff, but the burgers were the worst we've had in a very long time. Sorry, but Lenny's is not at all worthy of the rave reviews I'd heard about it. Maybe there's a Squiggy's somewhere nearby?"}
{"text":"You will NEVER want another burger(or fries, or milkshake) after trying Lenny's...I usually order a double cheese burger with bacon, onions, mustard, mayo, and ketchup, along with a lg. fry(with 2 fry sauces--very important! the special fry sauce tastes like some kind of chipotle remoulade...so delish!), and I LOVE their cinnamon shakes...so different!...  once you've tasted Lenny's food, you won't be able to stomach regular fast food ever again!"}
{"text":"Last week, after reviewing these customer reviews, I visted Lenny's for the first time.  The Burger was delicious and the Chili Fries were the best I have ever had. I am going to say that I liked it better than In and Out Burger.  However, I also ordered onion rings and they were not very good.  They had thick golden brown breading and were tastless.  They tasted like they were cooked in 3 day old oil.  Today I went back there and ordered a burger with french fries and to give a second chance ordered onion rings again.  Awsome Burger, great FF, but the onion rings were not good, again.  Great food other than their onion rings.  And this is coming from a guy who was in the restaurant business for 25 yrs before moving here some 15 yrs ago."}
{"text":"decent burgers, price doesn't include cheese thought that was a little strange.... Just got a burger with cheese and avocado and it cost me around 8 dollars with no fries or drink... Burger was fresh and juicy, a tad pricey"}
{"text":"Great Burger place. The Inside Is small but they have more seating outside in a building next to it which which is ac. Burgers tasted great my son got the chicken basket and even that was good. Prices were good about 7 bucks for their single burger combo. But the quantity was great burgers were big. I loved the fries good seasoning on it."}
{"text":"This place was good. I actually ate my whole burger and not just the fries like I usually do! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  I seem to gravitate towards this place when I'm working in the area.  The burgers are very tasty, the meat has a very good fresh grilled taste, much better than you'll find at other chain burger joints.  The fries are delicious as well as they are sprinkled with some kind of spice that makes them very tasty."}
{"text":"Lenny's does a great job paying homage to the classic 1950's American diner. Lenny's is an old-fashioned burger joint complete with countertop bar and the classic red booths and seating. I am giving Lenny's a 2/5 stars because I have tried several of their locations and I have been underwhelmed each time. I think there are several better burger joints nearby in town that have a competitive price and better quality.  In my experiences here the service has been fairly slow for the level of quality that is delivered... The atmosphere is class and should never change but I think it's time Lenny's reconsiders their ingredients and recipe."}
{"text":"In all of the years I have lived in this neighborhood, this was my first visit to Lenny's. Overall, I was impressed with the food but underwhelmed by the strange layout.   My mom and I ordered single cheeseburger combos and very much enjoyed the fresh bun and veggies and flavorful burgers. Even the fries were great.  There is a separate and unattached dining room but at least it was nice and cool unlike the ordering area which is narrow and too warm.  I would definitely order from there again but maybe to go!"}
{"text":"Their food is rrqlly good. The fries and strawberry shake are bomb. The only reason why i don't give them 5 stars is because they take FOREVER in the drive thru. I've gone several times and they literally take 15 mins just for 1 combo."}
{"text":"Can't beat the thin,  juicy chicken sandwiches.  Friendly,  fast service.  The best burger in town!"}
{"text":"Lenny's has been a long time favorite of mine and have visited 3 locations that I know of. I just slipped in on Central  for the delicious Mexican Burger that is served with a roasted green chili that tastes pretty darn authentic. So if it is canned it is a good one. Their fries are always hot and go best with the hot cheese dipping sauce. My only gripe is that they have all that wonderful grill but they can't fry an egg. All of their egg product comes in cartons. Egg with a burger? Who would'a thunk it?"}
{"text":"Great burgers, but be prepared to pay for every slice of cheese and get the fries with no salt. If you eat 9 combos the 10th one is free. 5 more to go."}
{"text":"I think in terms of local hamburger joints, Lenny's is pretty bad ass.    They have tons of toppings and ways to jazz up your burger.  You can watch them make your burger through the glass.  The shakes are pretty good as well.    It's a hole in the wall with enough character to raise it a few notches above the rest.  Other places, that are dives but good, like Lucky Boy are in the same class but Lenny's seems more like a destination as opposed to a drive thru.    However, to put in all in perspective, we're talking hamburgers here.  Nothing gourmet.  Five and diner style hamburgers, grilled sandwiches and fries.  You can add jalapenos, green chiles, chili, cheese, bacon,....whatever.  You pay one price for a drink and can choose whatever size you want.  The drinks are self serve.  It's easy on the wallet as well, as it should be.  I fed my family of five for around $35 or so.    My main criticism is the lack of big booths or more spacious seating.  Every time I go, the room with extra seating is closed off.  But seating everyone between the counter and the small booths is part of the experience, I suppose."}
{"text":"We usually go to the Lennys down the road. But I goofed and were hungry so we stopped anyhow.   The chocolate shakes we're great.  The burgers and rings just ok. The fries we're better than the burgers, but maybe we were just fry hungry."}
{"text":"In a moment of weakness I did something today that I vowed I would never do and that my friends, was to eat at Lenny's. Every time I have been to Lenny's I encountered the rudest, most disgruntled employees one could imagine. It got so bad on my last visit that I posted about my experience on every outlet possible. I wanted everyone to know what a horrific place Lenny's was and encouraged everyone to avoid it at all costs. Even when the owner reached out to me to apologize I couldn't be bothered to respond because I was so irate. He assured me through Yelp that the issues would be resolved and that if I were to return I would leave a satisfied customer. I never thought in a million years that he could turn that place around or that I would return but the thought of that delicious fry sauce got me back there. And let me shout it from the rooftops, that man stayed true to his word. I was greeted promptly at the drive thru and was told they would be right with me. The girl who ended up taking my order was friendly and when there was a question about my order she kindly asked for clarification. When I got the window the girl smiled, said hello and thanked me several times. When I got my food and checked the bag I found that my order was correct. And just as the owner promised, I left Lenny's super happy. I don't know what he did to turn those employees around but whatever it was I am grateful. So for anyone out there who have been put off by the employees in the past, I encourage you to give Lenny's another chance. It's doubtful you're going to find a better tasting burger from a fast food joint.....  And to the owner, thank you for your original response and for staying true to your word. My apologies for never responding to you. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've managed to live this long without trying Lenny's!   I was running errands today and happened to drive by at the same time I realized how famished I was.  So, I took a chance on s single with 1000 Island , cheese and all the fixins (but onion).  Of course, I had to have fries and a chocolate shake with it.  Go big or go home, right!?!?  The burger was just delicious, high quality beef perfectly cooked with delicious , fresh veggies and a soft sesame seed bun.    I only have 2 or 3 burgers a year so I try to make them count....this did not disappoint!    The shake was deliciously creamy, true flavored, and just thick enough.  It was perfect for dipping my fries.  Don't judge until you're tried it :)  The fries were OK but I will be ordering onion rings next time...I think my tastes have changed in terms of sides, I just don't seem to appreciate fries as much anymore.  The restaurant is cute; it's reminiscent of a 50's malt shop.  This really makes the meal more enjoyable!  I was really pleasantly surprised and highly  recommend Lenny's for a relaxed, unfussy, tasty burger.  P.S.  I went to Lenny's  again  today for a total of TWO times this week.  I called my order in for pickup and tried the onion rings this time.  They were really delicious ...light and not at all greasy!  The batter was not salty and clung nicely to the sweet, tender onions.    When I got there, I was told that my shake would be no charge as I had spilled part of  my shake from the last visit.  I was really impressed by that gesture and wanted to amend this review to let folks know what kinds of people are managing Lenny's!"}
{"text":"Solidly mediocre. My first time there was a but rushed & confusing. I walked in the door & was immediately asked to order before I had a chance to look at the menu.  So I decided to keep it simple & get a cheeseburger & fries. I was underwhelmed. If I am going to eat something that's going to make my ass even bigger, then it better taste fantastic.  Lenny's meh, I'll skip it."}
{"text":"This Lenny's is VERY small when they don't have the extra side open. The three of us had to sit at the counter, which really prevents any conversation from happening... The service was quick and friendly. Burgers are OK. I got the grilled cheese this time, and it was good. I really like the fries, but they give you way too many. Think I'll share one with my hubby next time and save a few bucks. They do have styrofoam cups which is nice in the heat, and the decor inside is 50's diner cutesy. Overall, I wouldn't go back. There's just better, cheaper places out there for a basic burger."}
{"text":"Had lunch at one of my favorite local burger shops in town... at least they used to be. Not anymore. I will not go back. You may ask, \"Why? You had such positive reviews! You love Lenny's!\" I do... at least the old Lenny's.   Not sure if they had a management change or if it was just a fluke but my burger was terrible. Want to know the reason? Here it is.   As I was leaving, I took a peek into the kitchen and saw one of the cooks pull out burger patties out of a steel container. The burger patties were soaked and looked cooked already. So basically they reheated these old cooked patties and served them to the guests.   If I want reheated yesterdays burger patties, then I will go to McDonald's. Sorry Lenny."}
{"text":"being from LA.. i didn't know where to get a good burger and chili cheese fries so i yelped chili cheese fries and 2 Wienerschnitzels topped the list.. and i thought.. wow.. it's gonna suck being out in AZ..   then i look further down the list and see 5 star review for lenny's burgers. and the words chili cheese fries. i didn't even read the review at all until i got back from my own experience.  but jetta's review is awesome!  let me say that in the midst of all the commercial chain burger joints.. we found a diamond in the rough.  looks like any random burger stand but when i saw the nacho cheese dispenser.. i just prayed that the cheese they used on the chili cheese fries... i watched as they prepared my food the fries sizzling in the oil and then drenched in the real chili not that runny ground meat crap.. but has kidney beans and a bite like real chili should and then she drizzles the nacho cheese and tops it with jalapenos..  oh and the kicker.. when i grabbed a fry and chomped it down.. i realized.. they even used seasoned salt on the fries before they chili'd it.  i was so pleased with the chili cheese fries i nearly missed the burger patties..  they are HUGE. and i just got a single on sourdough i believe it's a 1/4 lb of meat. and real meat. i think it would have been better to have the pattie thicker rather than so thin but it was still good.  they have different sauces on different burgers and a wide variety of shakes.  i couldn't finish my burger which i also added bacon too and they load it up with bacon. i had about 1/3 of the pattie left and it was still bigger than a big mac pattie.. maybe even both patties put together.  the establishment itself is sort of weird. it's quite narrow and there is counter space but they also have tables around the corner but it's setup in a very weird preschool like environment and it's super quiet.. almost freakishly quiet.. and i believe the restrooms are through the back door.  oh and there's a HUGE sign that says they don't accept checks.. just to warn everyone but who pays for a burger with a check?"}
{"text":"This place does not try to reinvent the Burger & Fry Diner or do anything new and exciting but they do a good job sticking to the classics.    I went for a late lunch on a Thursday so it was slow when I was there.  I loved the 50's diner look of the place.  Everything from the tile to the art to the booths was very nostalgic (says the 25-year-old).  I ordered the cowboy burger and onions rings with an Oreo cheesecake shake.  I sat a the booth where I could watch my burger get set on grill and my onion rings dropped in the oil.  Made to order is no joke there.  The food was very good.  The burger wasn't anything fancy or new but it was a good, and fresh.  The onion rings were straight-up dope.  I highly recommend the fry sauce to go with fries or onion rings.  It has just the right amount of kick.  the shake was insanely good.  If I'm downtown and looking for a burger again, this is definitely where I'll be going."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something bad and I mean clogging your arteries bad so I came to Lenny's. I got their chili cheese fries with jalapenos. The fries were ok but I wish they had more seasoning on them. I then got a Pepsi float, they only sell Pepsi products, which was ok too. The ice cream was a regular soft serve. Their onion rings are huge and delicious! Next time I'll get some all to myself1  Lenny's is a no frill place so if you're feeling bad then you will leave feeling content with satisfaction."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. My girlfriend wanted to head there so we thought we'd try it out. Awesome atmosphere! Lenny took our order & I must say, he is a pretty chill ass guy! The food itself was awesome! I had the mexican burger & the green chiles in it were pretty good! My girlfriend got the BLT & WOW I must say the amount the of bacon that they put in that sandwich is amazing! We also got our food pretty fast even though it was pretty busy! Definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to try!"}
{"text":"Walked over to Lenny's for lunch today.  Ordered the single patty burger.  It was good.  Have I had worse? ... Yes.  Have I had better? ... Yes.  Decor was great.  Service was great.  Fries were good.  The place seemed clean enough.  Did I meet Lenny? ... Yes.  Would I go back again? ... Yes."}
{"text":"I love LOCAL..and that's the reason I went to check this place out. Charming diner... Staff was friendly and welcoming. The food was very filling and left stuffed! Yummy fries too! Check this burger joint out.. They have other locations too."}
{"text":"I lived about 3 blocks from the location on Central ave so when I was in Glendale for a festival and saw this little dive burger shop I said HELL YA!!!! My daughter and her BF were a bit skeptical but left full and smiling. My daughter was amazed at the flavor of the burger...... old fashion style. Don't pass this place up or the Central ave location either."}
{"text":"Burger and shake were good, nothing to rave about. So what's to love? Great and fast service, even in a mad rush of customers, and awesome atmosphere! Kinda odd that soda refills are 40cents....but I got the Jamoca shake, which was uber thick and tasted great!  I plan to go back during a quiet time and see what it is like when there isn't a mad rush. I like those old time shops so I am a bit biased."}
{"text":"Burger was pretty bland.  Girl at the counter was very friendly.  Would not go back for the food."}
{"text":"Got a single bacon cheeseburger. It was around $5.80 which is a couple bucks lower than five guys burgers. Only had to wait a couple minutes. I liked it and would go back. Although five guys burgers gets a slight edge in taste it is more money too."}
{"text":"I work next door and its very hard not to eat at this place everyday. Great burgers, tasty shakes, and creative fries. This burger joint if the best for the price. I would eat here over 5 guys any day of the week. You definately have to try the pastrami fries."}
{"text":"Classic burger shop in downtown Glendale . I ordered the steak sandwich with fries. It was okay not great. Fries were almost burned."}
{"text":"I so wanted to try this place, and like it. The cost for the burgers was reasonable, and their is a dollar off of a combo coupon on yelp. The burger it self tasted good, but was dry , and very skimpy on condiments. I would go back again , but ask for extra everything, as I don't like dry burgers."}
{"text":"Rounded up to a 4.  I've been going to Lennys since I was a kid.  Mostly to the shop on 35th and Tbird.  For some reason the shop on 35th and the one down on central I seem to remember being a cut above the rest.  That being said Lennys is probably the best place to grab a bite within a few miles of this area.  Lord knows why there can't be a few good places to eat around 59th and Peoria but there sure isn't.    I've had several of the burgers several times and they are always good.  Nothing spectacular but much better than the other options around.  I've also had the pastrami dip which was very tasty but a bit small for the price.  The fries are larger cut and seasoned well.  They can over do the mayo so its best to ask light or none at all if you are not a fan of tons of mayo.  One thing my wife loves to get is their cherry shake.  It is very tasty.  I recommend sticking to the single cheese burger if its your first time.    The price is a little high for the type of food.  I believe its like 2.50 for a large fry.  Do you know how many potatoes 2.50 would buy?  And the service isn't all that fast or great either.  Typical teenage kids who would rather be home tweeting and texting.  All that being said, I still enjoy Lennys and the food has never once been bad in all these years.  I think I will have to hit up the one on 35th to see if it is better or I just remember it as much."}
{"text":"I drove past this place so many times and just dismissed it... How do you compete with places like In n' out, The Habit, Smash Burger and local goodies like Rocket Burger, Caveman Burgers and so many more. Phoenix has no shortage of great burger places and as we have seen once again, this place proves it. Possibly the best yet!  Their burger is so homemade tasting, the toppings are just so... American burger style, not overwhelming, overly \"crispy\" but more soft and sauteed tasting. The meat tastes so fresh and is prepared JUST right. The bun is fluffy yet warm, not overly toasted or anything. It's a perfect burger symbiosis!   Their inside seating area is small but very cute and very 50's dinner feeling, in a good way (not like Jonny Rockets, dear God what a mess...). The outside patio is very nice when it's not \"the-air-is-on-fire\" season in Phoenix as well. The service is fast, the prices are reasonable and while you may feel guilty for eating a cheeseburger you won't regret it one bit, not at Lenny's. One of the best burger places in all the US of A if you ask me."}
{"text":"This place use to be better. I'm not sure what's been going on but first their drink machine was down now today their fryer was down. I went ahead and ordered a burger anyway but was not very pleased. The mexican burger has always been great in the past but not today. The onions were hardly sauted and were large chunky raw pieces the burger was too charred and had bits of burnt edges, the green chilis were straight out of the fridge and put on the burger cold and the globs of mayo I had to scrape off was nauseating. Common seriously who eats that much mayo. I believe the owners need to step it up and get new equipment and retrain staff how to dress and cook a burger.....probably be a while before I give this place another try until then it's Rocket Burger for me."}
{"text":"First time customer review. Tried the double chili burger meal for just under $10. The burgers were cooked fresh to order. The chili was bland. I added some hot sauce but the texture was pastey. Not sure if it was old or came from a can but it had that taste. The cheese had that plastic taste. The meal was very substantial, almost too much food. I would go back but hold the chili and cheese."}
{"text":"Popped in again today! Had Chili Cheese Fries and a 20 oz root-beer float for under $6! Enough chili cheese fries to share too. They were awesome as was the float.   Service was quick. place was half full of High Schoolers but things were still clean, neat and orderly. A few nearby business people popped in also and were greated as regulars.   I'm a fan now! I'll be back to try something different or more of the same."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the most overrated restaurants on yelp.   I left my office on central and clarendon at 11:55AM, and didn't pull into the Lenny's parking lot a half mile down the road until 12:10PM. Of course, the stop and go traffic in downtown Phoenix at lunch hour really has no bearing on this review other than to show it is not worth the drive.   Upon entering I was instantly immersed in a crowd of 40 something yuppies desperately trying to prove they are hip in some way. Why trendy fast food restaurants have become a haven for them I have no idea.   Anyway, the service was quick considering how busy the place was. I ordered a double burger with cheese and fries. I was anticipating a tasty burger with good fries. Unfortunately what I got was simply an average burger with tasteless fries. It was basically like eating at McDonald's but without feeling sick afterwords. (Maybe that is the appeal?)  Whatever the case, I see no reason to fight through stop and go traffic and brigades of annoying white urban professionals to get an average at best burger when I could go to Burger Factory down the street and get the same of better quality burger without the traffic or crowds."}
{"text":"Consistently good burgers and fries. Wait time is minimal, even during the lunch rush mob, day in and day out. Lenny runs a tight ship and deserves a lot of credit. The cooks move very fast and the cashiers work fast.  Monday through Friday at lunch time, people are lined up out the door to get these burgers and fries, and that says it all."}
{"text":"The Cowboy Burger was sub-par, the Strawberry Cheesecake Milkshake was too, they both actually did not settle well with me. I ended up having a stomach ache soon after. However, service was wonderful! And the Sweet Potato Fries were perfect! So I definitely have mixed feelings about this place. Next time, I'll probably only get the Sweet Potato Fries."}
{"text":"If you ever get a chance to stop here Lennies makes a great hamburger and the inside to core is extremely cute unfortunately it is a little hard to see from the road but the employees are nice and the food is good!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years. Glad to see the new owner cleaned up the disappointment this place had turned into after the original change of ownership.  Fries are always hot and crisp now with a light dusting of season salt. Burger is consistently prepared well now as well.  Same basic menu items for the past 20 years...it's good to stick to a simple menu that works that you do well.  Might be nice to have a special one off burger on the weekend or something...."}
{"text":"Great tasting food. Sometimes service is slow but it's always tasty. Prices are high which suck."}
{"text":"Clearly ordering chicken fingers and onion rings was a bad choice. The rings were soggy and gooey... and the chicken fingers just tasted awful. I recommend sticking to the burgers here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who's older, Lenny's or myself, but we've been friends as long as I can remember.   Back when I was a kid this location had no outdoor seating, and the interior didn't seem nearly as cramped.  The patio that is located there now is a great addition to Lenny's.  Although I now realize that there may be a lot of people that don't know it wasn't always there.  As far as the food goes...well let's just say I remember it being a little bit better when I was younger.  From what I understand this location isn't \"officially\" a Lenny's anymore and it shows.  The 59th Ave. location still has the taste I remember, but this one's just slipping.  The burgers are still grilled right in front of you and you get to watch them season them live as well.  They also still have a lot of options for hamburgers but they're nothing you haven't seen before.  BBQ sauce, thousand island, ketchup and mustard.  All the old standards.  Unfortunately my favorite burger, the ranch burger, is the biggest flavor change at the place.  The ranch/mayo sauce used to run down my fingers and drip onto my burger paper leaving behind tasty little puddles of fattening bliss.  Now there's much less sauce, and it seems thin and watery.  As far as their hot dogs go...well I've never had the hot dogs in all the years I've been dining here, but my friends won't order anything else.  They love the chili dogs like a dog loves a bone.    It's still a good flame-broiled burger, and the fries are still amazing.  Obviously places evolve, and I can't dock points for not living up to my memories.  As a solo burger joint, the building is perfect.  If you go with a group, however, plan on sitting in their outside section because the inside is still far too small.  Oh, and if you are raising kids in the Glendale area I highly recommend this place as a great memory maker."}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice old world feel and great food!!"}
{"text":"I've learned that expectations can really effect your experience in pretty much any dining situation. Lenny's, for example, is an unassuming burger shack. It's tiny, clean, but really just unremarkable to look at. I was hungry for a burger, having had far too healthy of a breakfast and lunch. I didn't hate myself enough to go to the big \"royal\" burger chain across the street, so into Lenny's I went.  I forget the name of the burger I ordered. It may have been the Mexican burger, as it was topped with green chilli. That, and some onion rings, and I'm ready to go. A short wait later and there is a very pretty burger sitting in front of me. A toasted sesame bun. A hearty slab of very tasty beef. And these wondrously spicy and sweet green chilli. I was simply unprepared for a burger of this caliber to come from such a humble place. To top it all off, the onion rings were, in a word: perfect. I have never had such perfectly fried and battered rings. The onion was cut generously enough to still taste, but didn't get pulled out of it's fried shell in a single bite. Absolute heaven.   Don't judge a book by it's cover, I've been told. Nor should you judge a restaurant because it's small and tucked into a shopping plaza.   The book thing sounds better though."}
{"text":"Best burger joint in the valley IMHO.  Really, every time I go here I am reminded what attentive service, great ingredients, and craftsmanship can go into a burger.  This place is small, very small.  The line will flow out of the building often, but that's with only 4 people in line.  It's not fancy in any way, and they don't serve beer, but that's is appeal.  It's a place to get a burger and sit out on your tailgate and munch down while talking with friends.  Because the place is so small, you get to watch the same, I think two, guys make up your masterpiece and having gone enough to kinda know the flow, it's really neat.  They can fill up fast, but you never really wait to long for your food.  Portions of toppings, generous to say the least.  Some times I would swear there is more bacon then burger sometimes and that's not due to a lack of burger.  The sauces are poured on heavy but never seam to leak, and everything fried (Fries, onion rings, etc) are as generous in portion as in deliciousness.  And there are like 4 different hot sauces you can get for the fries including the best, mango habanero.  Eat here now.  Dooooo it...."}
{"text":"We have been trying to eat here for months. After our attempt today, we have decided to write off Lenny's as having the worst hours a restaurant or diner can have. We pulled up today @3:15pm to learn they close at 2:00pm on Saturdays. 5 and diner here we come."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries. Been a few times, always deliver. Fresh and hot. Might take an extra minute vs other drive thrus but doesn't normally get too crowded. I feel like like prices are just a bit high for what you get. I'd like to see better value options without drinks. Still, a top 5 choice for burgers and fries in town."}
{"text":"Burgers are pretty decent.  They have proven 3 times in a row that they are either unable to pay enough attention to get an order correct or plain don't care.  Last trip here. I can make a better burger at home and don't screw it up!"}
{"text":"My family's favorite place to eat! They always keep the tables clean, the music really sets the mood and the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars but it didn't let me the service is by far the worst service I have ever had it took over 30 minutes to get two shakes it's not like my order was complicated it was two shakes to top it of they didn't even remember that flavors it was are you serious wow never again"}
{"text":"Lenny's: A little hole in the wall in Old Town Glendale that serves awesome burgers, fries and shakes.  There's a reason why walls are covered with \"best of\" awards, it's because their burgers are that good.  They have probably one of the best burgers around and on top of that the meals are cheap, menu plentiful and the food is all-around good.    I HIGHLY recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love coming to Lenny's for two reasons. The first reason is that the burgers are awesome and the second reason is that it is right by my work.  It is easy to get in & out of and the service is quick.    It is a really cute little burger shop in downtown.  You just go to the cashier and order your food and then a couple minute later your food is ready.  My favorite burger here is the bacon cheeseburger with fries.     Happy Yelping."}
{"text":"I thought this was the same place as the other Lenny's Burger shops but they are separately owned! The ranch hamburger is so good! Added bacon to it! 10/10 Service was quick & friendly!"}
{"text":"Really good burger. I got the Mexican burger, and it was great. And not to expensive."}
{"text":"Went back last night for some dinner, had the Mexican burger... not as good as I remember it.   Burger was super greasy, they were stingy on toppings and the prices seemed they went up a couple of dollars for a combo..  yes I'll be heading somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"It's lunch time here in the LBC, and I want a big juicy burger like the ones I used to have at Lenny's!! The only *other* thing I miss about Phx.. What a gem of a find!! Hands down, the best little burger shack I've ever been to.. ever. And we stopped there completely on accident. The smell lured us in maybe lol Don't come here looking for decor (there really is none..).. just stand in line, place your order, and wait for the good stuff to grace you with it's presence :)   I remember people comparing Lenny's to In n Out and Sonic. How embarrassing! I love InO but you just can't compare the 2.. or 3. Sonic isn't even in the same league, sorry Sonic lovers of the valley.   ANYWAY, if you're in the 'hood, this is a MUST. BIGGER and better than In N Out and all that other stuff for sure. Drip down your hand, cheesy, beefy mouthfuls of bliss. And the fries..mmm... geez I'm hungry now!"}
{"text":"Great food, super fast lunch service.  seating was full but the bar was good place to sit to see all the action"}
{"text":"Yum. Old time taste that is reminiscent of the food found in Detroit. The owner is from there and I can tell. Great taste to the cheeseburger. I had sweet potato fries, which were good. I tried the bacon ranch fries and i highly recommend them! Delicious!!  Old time feel with a lot of busy decor which  makes it seem small inside. The staff is nice And i had a nice meal. Would come back again."}
{"text":"I got the double combo and would have to say I was not impressed at all in fact I threw half the burger away. The burger itself was not seasoned and tasted like sub par quality meat. The only reason it got a two was because the fries were okay. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I will admit you guys used to be way better. Someone new must have taken over because the last time I tried eating here it was nothing like it was before. The fries, burgers, chicken everything almost was different. This used to be the spot in high school everyone went there. Now it seems empty. Now you know why. Lol"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ burger and I was pleasantly surprised. The bbq was most likely a generic store bought but still tasted good and tangy.  The burger has a charbroiled aroma to it which was really nice and was a good decent size.  The fries were very oily and had a darker brown color. Overall it was a decent burger but for the price I think I would still rather get Habit Burger."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I always get the mushroom garlic burger! The wait time is usually slow (I knocked one star off due to that) but thankfully they have a dual drive thru! You have to try their chili cheese fries, they are big enough to share but then again who wants to share a little piece of heaven... right?! My husband always gets their banana shake, he says it's the best banana shake he has ever had."}
{"text":"I had been going here for years but then moved out of the area.  After moving back I have been going back to Lenny's a little bit here and there.  Today when I asked my wife what she wanted for lunch, and she said Lenny's, I was happy.  I would usually go with 4 stars for a place like this because the food is that good in my opinion but I am just tacking on the extra one this time for the nostalgia.  Does nostalgia make food taste better you ask?  You're darn right it does.  Two single country burgers, a single order of chili cheese fries, and a vanilla shake later I was back in high school and college all over again.  I really hate going back to my old dives because I am afraid they are not going to live up to my memories as some have and been scratched off the list.  But Lenny's lived up to that and more today.    You just can't beat how small and packed it gets.  People lined up out the door around noon each day, waiting for their food, barely being able to keep up with the filling of drinks and ketchup cups.  But it happens like clockwork just as I have remembered.  But truly, the food is pretty darn good and it has stood the test of time.    I can't wait to go back.  P.S. Does anyone know what the Lenny's wi-fi was about?  It was locked down but why even broadcast it?  Can you pay for wi-fi there?"}
{"text":"Well drove all the way over there to be disappointed! I saw the place on the news and thought okay someplace good to try!!! NOT!! Yes it was 3.79 for burger but they add $4.00 to make it a combo! They advertise $1.00 drinks so mighty expensive French fries!!!! Special for 2 chili dogs $2.99 but $6.99 for combo! Seems to me making it a combo should be a bargain not an added expense! Okay back to the burger, nothing special at all, in fact it does not even rate up there with a whopper! Small meat patty with no flavor, the toppings shredded lettuce, tomato onion pickle, bun and can't taste the meat at all! I gave it the extra star for the fries, they were hot and seasoned well! It's probably our first and last time to ever eat there! I can't tell you how very disappointed we were!"}
{"text":"Time to let someone else do the cooking on a TOASTY Wednesday in Phoenix. Lenny still makes the GREATEST Mexican Burger, LOADED WITH all the good peppers, cheese, bun and beef.  Try it...you'll like it !!"}
{"text":"It's Alright. It's not horrible but it's nothing amazing. I'd put it in line with the other fast food burger chains. Some staff are nice but others put me off. I saw one worker where a lady's order wasn't right and when she told the worker, that worker seemed to react annoyed as if \"what do you want me to do about it?\" My order wasn't right but at least they didn't make a fuss about it and corrected it. So yeah I guess hit or miss?"}
{"text":"Custom burger, fries and drink for under $10... Yes, Please!  I've recently moved offices to a mere block away from Lenny's and couldn't take the torture of smelling my co-workers fries anymore, so I decided to give it a try.  I'll just say it was everything I had hoped for.   When I arrived promptly at noon, the place was already packed (good sign of deliciousness), so I hopped in line and pondered all the options for building my burger.  As a vegetarian, I get excited to see a menu that gives me options. I was pleasantly rang up by Lenny himself, who greeted me with a hand shake!  I decided on the Veggie burger topped with Cheddar cheese, BBQ, Ranch and green olives (Why not), with a side of sweet potato fries.  My meal was cooked to order, and only took about 10 minutes.  After picking up my order,  the long (20 ft) walk from the counter to the table was a test of my inner strength, as I wanted to plow my face into the shiny orange fries.  I contained myself for the moment and then devoured every last one of them.  Lenny's was definitely a lunch time treat and I will be back.  Although next time I need to plan a nap hour after my visit, because I was in a food comma!"}
{"text":"Hell to the yeah! This place is great! I tried the Veggie Burger and it was delicious and juicy! Chicken sandwich, hot dog, Burger, chicken strips, fries, and more! A great place to have lunch! Recommended!"}
{"text":"First time here. I only wanted a drink but I ordered some fried zucchini as well.  There was one person in front of me.  They only had one bag handed to them so their order wasn't to big yet I still listened to 4 songs while in line. Seriously WTF took so long!!!!!!!!!  Over 15 minutes for one car  Zucchini was a little over cooked as well.   By time I got my tea, most of the ice had melted and it was watered down as a result.   Ill never be back."}
{"text":"Definitely the go to Lenis location of all. Super friendly service and always juicy and delish burgers. My absolute favorite is the cowboy burger and usually go for this. French fries are always crispy hot and addicting. Of course its closed Sundays but they have other locations."}
{"text":"Not good at all ! You get a cheap patty, hard bread, and the time it took was crazy long should have went to Wendy's or something"}
{"text":"My picky 9 year old and her friend said these were delicious burgers. I thought they were good myself. The country burger was really good. They went great with the thick fries and onion rings! The staff was friendly as well."}
{"text":"The real deal!  Great burgers, true diner atmosphere. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I know what a fresh pattie tastes like. I ordered a cheese burger and I got a burger with old meat that had been sitting out all day somewhere kept warm. My burger was cold and tasted nasty. I went back the counter to ask for a fresh burger. They said they would make another one \"fresh off the grill\". Instead I got an old pattie that was thrown in the grill to make it hot. How do I know? Because I was watching and by the time I came back to my seat right by the counter, my burger was already out.   So disappointed. And I really like Lenny's. Not this location anymore. For sure, I am sorry for cheating on in-n- out. This place ALWAYS makes your order WHEN YOU order it. Not sitting in a container keeping it warm."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times were a good experience.  Lenny and staff are super friendly and welcome you in.  So far I've had the normal cheese burger and the \"mexican\" burger which is really just a cheese burger with green chilis.  I can say that the mexican burger is amazing.  The green chilis fuse with the meat so well that before you know it you almost bit your hand from devouring this burger.  Not much more I can write about this place....I wish it was bigger as during lunch time it can get rather crowded."}
{"text":"Super clean inside and delicious burgers!  The Mexican burger is my favorite and the fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"I've been to Lenny's twice now after my husband raved about how much he had loved it when he worked downtown a few years ago.  Both times I have been, we went on a weekday in the evening.  They close down half of the shop, since lunchtime is their busiest.  It is across the street from my fav place, Best of Philly.  What a hard choice between the two, especially when my hubby loves Lenny's and I love Philly.    The first time I went I saw a picture of their Chili Cheese Fries in the window and knew I had to have them.  It took me forever to figure out what type of burger I wanted though, b/c they have combos that they have created and then a ton of different ways to create your own.  I decided on the Sourdough Burger and it was super tasty.  The sourdough is toasted and the burger is juicy.  Perfect!  As for the chili cheese fries...incredibly good!  I did try their regular fries on my second visit and the seasoning they put on them is really good too.    My husband just loves the Mexican Burger, which has green chile on it and pepper jack cheese.  He is obsessed with it and pretty much dreams about it, and both times I have been in I have heard people also ordering it.    The atmosphere is one of an old diner with a white tin roof and tiled counters.  One gripe I have is that they don't seem to keep it cool enough inside.  There are ceiling fans, but the sun blasts into the front windows and I end up sweating while I am eating.  It's uncomfortable, so that is what prevents me from giving them 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is adorable! My husband & I both ordered cheeseburgers, 1 order of fries & onion rings to split. The onion rings & fries were soooo good, the burger was good as well, just nothing to write home about.  Prices were great, they even have $.99 root-beer floats. Servers were very friendly. It's pretty small inside but plenty of seating outside as well as a drive-thru if you're looking to get it to-go."}
{"text":"Everything was so fresh and fast. Like honestly i loved the whole atmosphere of this ol time diner \ fastfood"}
{"text":"Burger-bland dry and not juicy. Fries - crispy,nice salty, and so good.  Ingredients- good Bun- meh  Overall big disappointment"}
{"text":"All the things I liked before were here again.  Also, I was super - hungry so everything had an extra special deliciousness to it.  Great way to get over \"the Mondays\""}
{"text":"This is definitely a favorite spot for myself and my girlfriend. In fact every time I want to ask her a favor I usually take her here. After she's had her fill of thick cut fries and a juicy burger, how could she ever so no.   I love their variety of dipping sauces. The \"fry sauce\" is very interesting with a nice basil flavor. Im still trying to figure out what the \"lenny sauce\" consists of. Perhaps some fellow yelpers with a more refined pallet than I can enlighten me. It seems to always be busy with a variety of people (from families to police officers), especially now that they've done the beautiful \"50's style diner\" remodel. This is a testament to the quality of their food.  I have also tried their floats which are phenomenal, LOADED with tons of creamy vanilla ice cream. Only their hotdogs never really made an impression on me.  Def would recommend. A good affordable place to: ask a favor, deliver bad news, or just enjoy a good burger..."}
{"text":"Well this is my first time at Lenny's and I had a bacon, mushroom, and cheese burger. The burger was cooked well and tasted so-so. I had a better burger the other day at a Greek place. Not saying that it's horrible here, just average. By the way, the sweet potatoe fries I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"What a gem! I've worked down the street from this place for 4 years and I just tried this place at the request of a co-worker. Simple burgers and hot dogs (the chili dog was wonderful), fries, onion rings and shakes.   They also have breakfast but I have not tried that yet.  I really enjoyed the food, the staff and the ease of parking in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"I came specifically to Glendale to have Zing's green chili mac -n- cheese, but they are closed for business, which while it sucks it does kind of make sense.    Starving to death (all due respect to people actually starving to death) I wandered into this place.  It was a good burger, not amazing like my amazing horse that tastes just like raisins.   (plug in \"amazing horse\" into \"the\" Youtube at your own risk).      Everything was good.... but I would probably keep searching for the exceptional in down town G-Dale."}
{"text":"Decent food, terrible services. Attitude when  discovered they had given us the order and had to re do it.  2nd time order was still wrong."}
{"text":"Came here after a doctors appointment at St. Joes. We came around 11ish. Just a few peeps in the restaurant. The atmosphere was great, LOTS of decor but I was really in awe of the menu. Looked great! Prices were decent. I was told to get the Cowboy burger because it was \"really\" good, eh, I've had better. It literally crumbled in my hands, maybe too much sauce? I don't know but with the use of a napkin, LOTS of them, I was able to eat it, come on, I was hungry. I do have to say the the french fries SUCK. Seriously. Don't give me half cooked fries. They weren't even crispy. It was gross to be honest with you and reading other reviews, looks like I'm not the only one who thinks they should work on their french fries.  The ONLY reason why I won't come back here is because we came in early, I witnessed them cooking a ton of burgers and putting them in a dish - waiting for the \"lunch crowd\" to come in. That isn't fresh LENNY! How long are those cooked burgers going to sit there? Kinda not my thing."}
{"text":"I went here today at about 11ish to pick up an early lunch.  There were 2 people there ahead of me.  The whole process from ordering to getting my meal was well under 10 minutes.  I really didn't know much about this place except for what I read on Yelp.  Seemed like a pretty solid place and not to far from my office so what the heck.  I wasn't expecting much because I am not really a fan of the just about the entire 85209 zip code as far as dining options go.  I mean there are a few hole-in-the-wall type places that look promising but that's about it.  This is your classic hole-in-the-wall burger place that looks like it has been there for forever.  It has a great vibe to it and you can tell it is definitely not a run-of-the-mill franchise.  Anyway, the cashier was very fast and friendly as was the cook.  I ordered a \"Mexican Burger\" combo and it was delish just like a few of the reviews on here said it would be.  I especially loved the fries.  Perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of crunchiness.  The burger/topping had excellent flavor and was a decent size.  Their not-frozen burger patties are cooked on a real grill right in front of you which is nice.  I will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 I would. Very poor customer service. We tried to give this place our business, but they weren't interested.  We watched them turn away a group of 3 customers because it was 4 minutes before 10a.m. (when they open). We tried be be considerate, and gave them until 10:05 to open the doors, they just look at us. So we turned around and went to a fantastic place, called burger shop, on 35th ave and thomas."}
{"text":"Mmmm, Lenny, you make one tasty burger.  Seasoned well, delicious and quick. I've been going to another Lenny's in North Phoenix for about 15 years now and it's dangerous that this is in my new neighborhood. Pretty soon I'm going to look like a hamburger!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in the state of Arizona!! The way they cook the burger and the fries makes things taste so good! Small little shop but the customer service and the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"Delightfully surprised!  This place doesn't look like much from the outside in an unassuming strip mall.  Inside, you enter a 50's diner theme and the staff is amazing friendly...from the cashier to the cook who brought us our food.  The food was so tasty and reasonable!  The single burger with 1,000 Island and cheese was a little messy, but totally worth it.  The fries were fresh and so good too.  I will definitely be back when I am in the mood to eat all of my calories for the day in one meal!"}
{"text":"It's so good me and my 3rd daughter and my 2nd child got subway and she doesn't like hamburgers she should try it"}
{"text":"Excellent burger and fries!!!! Great place that brings back the 50s style. Friendly service and would recommend it to anyone who wants a excellent burger."}
{"text":"Cute place and location is awesome! A lot of items on menu and can we say greasy food, should try and fix that.   Burgers are always made fresh and the best, yet!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. I love the diner look, and the good food comes out fast. 7 dollars for a combo is a bit pricey, but it's better quality than any of the fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Loved the look. Old School. It was clean. Also very yummy. Love my buger's & fries. :) price is fair."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place on Wednesday, July 3, after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We were traveling up Central looking for a place to cool off and have a cold drink, when my wife Marie noticed the sign for Lenny's on the nondescript strip mall.  She had noticed \"Shakes\" on the window, so we pulled in to check it out.  Not a big place, but decorated like a diner from the 1950's but smaller.  Lenny's was busy.  People in line, people sitting enjoying their food. We got in line and quickly moved up to the counter.  Marie ordered a 32 oz. mint cookie shake and I ordered a 32 oz. vanilla shake and an order of french fry for both of us.  The total for the order was $11.00.   We waited about 3 minutes and our fries were ready.  Picking that up at the counter, I see they are making our huge shakes.  Another 2 minutes and our shakes were ready.  Both of us found the flavors very enjoyable and the ice cream treat was cold and refreshing.  The fries were tasty and we snacked on them as we sipped our way into a sugar coma.  We were able to watch the burgers being made as we sat at our small booth and both commented on how good they looked.  Next time I'm in central Phoenix I will check out the taste of the burgers."}
{"text":"I like the diner atmosphere. The burgers, hot dogs and fries are good.  I was kind of turned off by the cashier that took my order. I didn't catch her name cause they don't wear name tags, but the receipt says \"cashier left\". She kept talking over me. Then she ask what I want on it? Listen, if someone orders a burger but doesn't say \"but hold the ____\" then that must mean I'm ordering it as it comes. Plus she seems like she was tired."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Arizona! Everything tastes fresh and the char on the grill is awesome! If you go to a Lenny's go to this one!   Employees are also very friendly and fun to be around!"}
{"text":"Burger was not as good as I expected after reading other reviews. Luckily I grabbed a chili dog also which was better than the burger. Nice atmosphere but a little disappointed in the burger. Oh well. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Juicy and tasty burgers cooked fresh to order and how you want it. I find this one to be the best food, but not so good with dine in seating. But you come here for the food, not to sit. If you haven't tried Lenny's before and have the cholesterol karma to spare, you're missing out on a great local business. You'll soon find yourself coming here for many years too."}
{"text":"I haven't tried this location yet but I am familiar with the Lenny's on 35th Ave and Thunderbird as I have lived in the area for years.  Their burgers are very delicious as well as their fries.  The only reason I don't frequent Lenny's too often is because I am so used to the fast food and cheaper prices.  However, make no mistake about it the best burger in town is Lenny's so give it a try heck with today's value meal prices at other fast food places your not gonna pay too much more anyway unless you like the dollar menus."}
{"text":"The burger combos are expensive compared to an ordinary fast food place but the burgers and fries are so yummy. I visit here about once a year and that's just because it's too expensive to make it a regular spot but when I want a good burger and fries this is the spot.  They only get four stars because they got rid of Pepsi products and brought in Coke.  However, through Yelp when I check in I receive a $1 off any burger combo!  Scored that deal today and OMG the burger and fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"As an overdue pregnant lady with a random craving for cheeseburgers every now and then, there is rarely a burger that I'm unhappy with. I found it today. This burger was down right gross. Mushy and tasted like dog food is the closest I can describe it but even that doesn't cut it. I can't get the nasty taste out of my mouth even hours later. I wish we went to McDonalds or drove all the way to In and Out instead. The fries and onion rings were good though. I can't understand the raving reviews for this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burgers I have had in a long time! Lenny's is clean, cheap and fast! My food was done before I finished filling up my soda. I went with a party of 5 for lunch and there was no problem finding a seat. If you work downtown, I would definitely stop by for lunch!"}
{"text":"NEEDS A CUSTOMER FACING DISPLAY FOR THEIR POINT OF SALE SYSTEM. The staff here is WONDERFUL, and the OWNER IS ALWAYS HERE, yes that's right, if you come here often, you have the pleasure of meeting Lenny himself.  But one major flaw is that they need a display on their point of sale system showing you what you have ordered before you pay (just like their Glendale location), because I have had my order messed up more than quite a few times here, usually they forget my extra french fries, or place everything in the world on my cheese burger, when I only wanted the cheese, meat, and bun.  Other than that, I don't really have anything negative to say about this place. I love the staff, and if the right person is at the register, they remember my order and the negative points I have made above is negated."}
{"text":"Great burger. Not greasy. Fun atmosphere. Staff was OK with bringing a work lunch."}
{"text":"I went there last night and ordered a 3 piece fish, and I when I got home, I couldn't believe that they actually gave a little burned up piece of fish as part of the meal! Never going to go there again. I will put up a picture on Facebook!"}
{"text":"heaven in a bun! No, seriously!!! It is AMAZING... The burger is flame grilled and you get the option of the sauce you want on it... it is a bit pricey for a burger, but why pay $7 at McDonalds for a meal when you can pay $9 and get REAL FOOD!!! MY FAVORITE BURGER SHOP HANDS DOWN!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger shop! I prefer the Mexican burger but they are all great. There milkshakes are the best around and the price is very reasonable. If you haven't been to Lenny's you have to go!"}
{"text":"I remember Lenny's from 2003 on 27ave & Glendale. One of the first places in AZ that reminded me of some good burgers back home in L.A. I heard they opened one in central Phoenix so I had to stop by. I noticed they have a new look and their menu has so much stuff compare to the first place. Wtf?! holding out on us on the west of Phoenix? Well it's okay I forgive you guys, I seen they are remodeling the one on 27ave & Glendale same look and menu better be the same :)"}
{"text":"Super decent for a don't place-- wasn't too impressed with the ranch burger but the fries alone are worth coming back for! My kid's loved it and my boyfriend swears by it. Lenny's is definitely great for a greasy spoon!!"}
{"text":"I have to stay away from this place or I will end up so fat I will have to drive a scooter. Awesome burgers and shakes and fast lunch service. Can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Took my family to a weekend getaway. Found this gem by accident. While all places were closing they were still open.  Took my 3 little girls and my wife . Food was so good. This place reminded me of Portillo's back in chicago.   The first bite into the burger and it brought back memories to being back in my hometown.   Service was fast and workers were very nice.   I will do my best to stop by this place again whenever I am back in town."}
{"text":"My Favorite Food:   Greasy Cheeseburgers served fresh Hot and with an Awesome side of Fries and A Diet Coke of course.  Food is really good and the owner was very fast and friendly!  4 ppl for lunch all had combo meals $26.00 what a deal."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh and well put together. Had the double burger and pastrami fries, fast and hot, interesting flavors.  Best part is the staff. Really good kids. Efficient, clean and super polite.  Fun decor adds to the experience."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars for dear old Lenny. I want to say that I am a fan , and it pains me to not be a fan. But after many minutes of deep soul searching, I have come to a realization . I go to Lenny's for the peanut butter shakes. there i said it.  It's true. I  thought I was going because its  of its old time,   hole in the wall  flavor or the friendly neighborhood service. Because it has a charm . But I now know that  all we are  or ever will be is shake buddies."}
{"text":"This wasn't a meal it was an experience!  The staff is very culturally diverse and friendly.  Meaning you can barely understand them through their various thick accents from around the globe; however they were calm, patient, and friendly trying their best to bridge the communication gap in their broken English.  As for environment it was kind of a cool although cramped 50's inspired burger shop.  For the food, I admittedly made a mistake by going to a burger shop and ordering hotdogs.  I will have to re-evaluate them once I attempt what they are known for, a burger.  As for what I did order it was chili cheese dogs.  The bun was acceptable though soggy.  This was the chili's fault not the bun.  The chili I have to give two ratings to.  I'm originally from Texas so am very critical of anything claiming to be chili.  From a Texans stand point this was not chili, it was a flavorless watery ground meat (of some sort) and bean soup.  So because it coated everything I ordered I'd give the food 1 out of 5.  From an Arizonan standpoint you could say the chili was passable, there are very few good chili options, so I doubt most would know the difference.  The Weiner looked like something my grandad would have if on a viagra bender.  It was old, hard, dry, wrinkly, with pink and red blotches...  Gross....  The chili cheese fries had the same issues with chili the dogs had, the cheese was also bland, but a taste of a plain fry let me know they had potential.  There are many different specialty fry combos here so maybe another option would be better.  All in all the food was under whelming so I gave a 3 out of 5 pending re-evaluation on other menu items."}
{"text":"I don't make it out to Lenny's as often as I like. I had the single cheeseburger combo for $7.69 today. The combo included the a fresh burger grilled in front of you, freshly cooked fries and a ginormous soft drink. Lenny's has a wide array of condiments to adorned your burger and they always get that part right. The burger is juicy and delicious and the fries are hot and tasty as well. I recommend their gigantic shakes which are in the $4 dollar range (too heavy for lunch). Next time I have to try the chili cheese fries, they looked awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Old school diner vibe was great along with the background music.  Burger and fries were great and prepared exactly the right way. Only reason I knocked off a star is that I do know it's possible to get a precooked and then regrilled burger (out of a warmer next to the grill). Mine was fresh however and was very very good.   Had a blt and zucchini fries today. AWESOME!"}
{"text":"You can't be serious...this is my all time favorite burger joint...but they could care less about sticking to their posted hours...went in on a Sunday before 6pm and they were closed (according to yelp and google and the door sign) they should have closed at 7pm....plenty of time till 7pm...went their and the open sign was off and there was nobody behind the counter and the door was locked...this was supposed to be my last meal before I started a new diet and I really wanted Lenny's...wow...I'll still go here but I used to tip because everyone their is amazing...no more will I tip....horrible move to close early...great food...ruined my Sunday!"}
{"text":"We went here last weekend after craving some burgers. The menu looked a little confusing, mainly bc the place is so small and it seems like there are so many options. We each got a build-a-burger where you can choose two toppings for free. I got mushrooms and bacon and my boyfriend got green chiles and bacon. We also got chili fries and a chocolate milk shake. It was soooo good!  There's this place in Berkeley back home called Nation's that has awesome burgers as well, and it's bigger. But it's more expensive and you can't get the toppings for the price at Lenny's. My meal with reg fries and  a large drink with a burger and my toppings was only $5.99! It was very tasty and we were stuffed. The chili fries were better than Nation's too bc it had more chunks of meat. I also liked that their fries had this yummy paprika garlic salt on it, it was so good!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here for a while, but never could resist the Philly shop nearby. Well, was downtown tonight and the Philly shop is closed. Finally had my first Lenny's experience....and boy was it good!  The burger was very flavorful and juicy. Not fancy or over thought...just a good burger."}
{"text":"Been there only once.  A hole in a wall place type restaurant with general fast food.  The burgers are pretty good but I've had better."}
{"text":"Lenny's burgers are fantastic.  One of the best burgers out here.  They are a bit pricey especially charging extra for the cheese and fries can add up to $10+.  Overall good place to get an occasional burger from time to time."}
{"text":"Came in for a Chocolate Malt and got Hershey' s Syrup with vanilla ice cream, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Was just driving by when I decided to try this place. I ordered their pastrami dip with spicy mustard and a soda. I am not much of a pastrami person but a pastrami dip just sounded good. It was! So when I have more time, family and I will come back and give this place a better try!! But so far it was great."}
{"text":"Lenny's is a west valley legend. I think most locations are independently owned but they seem to have the same food. If you are in the mood for a great, greasy burger this is the place to go. There isn't a burger in town that can come close to Lenny's!"}
{"text":"We had burgers, fries and milk shakes. They were very good. The service was prompt and the restaurant was clean. There isn't much seating,  so it's not great for large groups. But overall, very good. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place! It was my first time here today. I had the No. 1 combo, basically a regular cheeseburger with fries and a drink. My cheeseburger was standard, but yummy! Patty wasn't dry and the lettuce, onions, and tomatoes seemed fresh. The burger also had melted cheese and was sufficiently saucy for my taste. Fries were hot, not overly-salty and crunchy. Overall, it was a good meal. The pricing is decent, standard diner prices--pretty affordable, I'd say--and the menu offers some interesting options like the green chile burger. Definitely returning to try some of their other options next time! Bacon cheese fries mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Well I've Been there a few times and the couple times were very good, delicious and service was ok. This time was terrible I ordered the mex burger chili cheese fries and my sisters order and my moms order, they gave me cheese fries instead of chili cheese and the ranch omg I'm really picky about ranch I hate hidden valley in the bottle it's sweet and gross and this ranch tasted just like it, usually it's the savory good ranch. And they sodas we got were wrong and they were flat. So overall this visit was not very good."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, although the man at the register did not want to let me put a punch for my burger on my friends punch card. I didn't understand that since it was still a burger being paid for to contribute to her free burger and seeing as how I don't go here often... Anyways, the burger was fine. It was a little more char-broiled than I would like. The party was very thin and not very juicy. The bun was nothing special. The cheese fries however were delicious! Probably won't go out of my way to come here, but it was good for a cheap quick burger."}
{"text":"Food is good, best chicken strips I've ever had. It's a little crowded too many people at lunch time. Parking lot for that strip of restaurants is too small/ insane. I had the hotdog combo today it was ok. The price was a little more than you should pay for hotdog/hamburger establishment. Service was fast and staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Consistently great food! Been going to this location for easily over 5 years. Burgers are always delicious along with fried mushrooms! My favorite is the Mexican burger with pepperjack cheese. Classic but doesn't need anything else!"}
{"text":"Second time here on a Saturday with the family. Food is great kids enjoyed it and I enjoyed my burger.  The cashier didn't smile or inviting (she didn't have an attitude either) but she did give us what we asked for and asked our table if everything was fine, so that was nice. The cook was nice too."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day  It was about 7:30 pm and I was craving a burger, so I thought I would give Lenny's a try. The drive-thru line was long, so I was hoping the food was worth the wait. Unfortunately, on this visit I have to say the food just wasnt very good, maybe it was an off day.  I ordered a patty melt and fries. The patty melt was okay, nothing special. However, the fries were cold, limp, and of course not worth eating. I was disappointed. If the line was not still already so long, I would've gone back.   Maybe, I will revisit again."}
{"text":"Okay, here's the scoop on this location.  First time I went was January/2016 I ordered Fried Zucchini and I thought it was overpriced but when I got them they gave me plenty and it was good but I did not know I was paying extra for a small (first-time) ranch sauce which was not worth $0.30 extra.  The amount of zucchini was worth it at that time.  Then I went again last week, boy was I disappointed they only gave me half of the amount for a extremely high price of $3.09 plus tax = $3.41.  Well, it was not worth it!  It costs too much money and I did complain inside the restaurant and the Caucasian, overweight woman told me the manager blah blah blah and I told her back that it was too pricey and they should not charge for the first sauce of any kind.  I told her that for 20 years I had been going to Lenny's Burger on 16th Street & Osborn Rd and have never been cheated with the amount of the zucchini nor ever been charged for one Ranch sauce.  I also told her how could they still be in business and I see why because they don't have to pay the cooks very much, in fact they are being paid less than the average Federal wage and that is discrimination.  They are a bunch of racists working at the registers."}
{"text":"OMG the mushroom burger from this place is amazing! So delicious and melty with all the good stuff on there without having to alter my order. I go out of my way to eat here and dream about the mushroom burger made with fresh mushrooms and melty gooey cheese and mayo, lettuce and tomato. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"The shake was good, and the fries were decent, but this is a burger place so the burger should be the star of the show. It wasn't good. It was bland, tough, and grey. It tasted as if it had been boiled in water. There was no hint of char, no grilled flavor, nothing. Not only was my cheese not melted, it was still cold and in a perfect square. The ranch mayo sauce was so runny and wet that my entire bottom bun was soggy and wet, and my tomato slices were sour and mostly green obviously from an underripe tomato. They tried to send me off without my drink and they did send me off without my condiments which they charged me for. They charge for condiments btw.. Only reason I gave 2 stars is the Oreo shake was pretty good."}
{"text":"Their bathroom is the filthiest I've ever seen. I'm not exaggerating. The toilet looked as if never cleaned. Same with the urinal, sink and floor. As far as the food goes what's the big deal about this place? Fries are tasteless, greasy and I suspect cooked in old oil. Burgers not made fresh, how this place wins awards is a mystery to me."}
{"text":"Whenever I think of Lenny's Burger, I think of that urban myth about ecstasy.   You know the one.  \"If you have sex on ecstasy, you'll never be able to enjoy it sober.\"    Why, because the experience is that intense, or because you're brain has been so fried that you can't realize you've spent the last twenty minutes trying to fondle a rock?   And why the fuck are you dropping this on me now? Like I'm not stressed out enough worrying about how a ouija board works and whether or not Mountain Dew depletes your sperm count. Shut up, you.  Lenny's Burger is the ecstasy of hamburger joints.  You go in there not expecting much. Perhaps even a little condescending because you're so fucking spoiled you don't know any better.  \"Ha! Look at this ironically low-end establishment! Why, they don't even have a value menu! Bush league! Oh, how cute. They expect you to pump your own condiments. What, couldn't afford the little packets? Ha. This shall be a good laugh.\"  And then you order, I don't know, for argument's sake, a double-patty chili burger. And fries. And let's just say that, for shits and giggles, you fill your drink cup up with horchata, because it's my fucking scenario.  You bring your order back to your table. Ha. How quaint. Burgers served in a noisy steamy cafeteria setting. How retro.   One minute you're biting into a slab of meat in between some bread.  And the next you're in fucking Willy Wonka land.  Your taste buds suddenly become Charlie and Veruca and Augustus.  HOLY SHIT THIS BEEF TASTES LIKE IT CAME FROM A REAL ANIMAL! AND THIS CHILI'S FRESH! THE BUN IS TOASTED! JESUS TAPDANCING CHRIST, THESE ARE THE MOST AMAZING FRIES EVER! I'VE NEVER HAD BURGER JOINT FRIES THIS GOOD! AND THIS HORCHATA FUCKING ROCKS! IT TASTES JUST LIKE I IMAGINE HORCHATA WOULD TASTE!  And believe me, muchachos, if there were snozberries on that burger, they would taste like snozberries.  By the time you've finished your burger, you already crave one again.  You spend the next few weeks trying to convince your friends to try it with you.  \"Dude, you have to try this burger place. They have the most amazing fuck me burgers ever! Seriously.\" \"Nah, man. I'm good.\"  WHAT!? Bitch, you did not just turn down a suggestion from an Elite!  Weeks later, you find that nobody wants to try this place.  Because they're all trying to get clean.  They're trying to cut back on the fast food. Get on a good diet, go vegan, cut out the refined sugars and carbs or whatever the fuck it is that people with a nutrition book do.  It's not you. They're not turning YOU down.  They just know. They know because they've seen it happen.  One Lenny's Burger and suddenly they're lives will go out of control all over again.  One bite of a double-patty country burger with cheese and chili fries and suddenly they'll start double-dipping and eating right before they go to bed, and years from now they'll be wearing those electronic belts that zap the fat off of you while they get their cry on to a very special episode of Maury Povich.  It's just you and Lenny's now.   You'll do your best to be stoic about it. Eating alone while tables of laughing hipsters and married couples enjoy their hearty meal, stopping to give you the occasional look as they slowly decide in their minds what could possibly be so wrong with you as to force you to eat your meals alone.  \"Just come with me once. I'll pay for it.\" \"No thanks. I'd rather do McDonald's.\" \"WHAT!? Didn't you watch Super Size Me?\" \"Actually, I just did. Now I want a Big Mac.\" \"Fine...just this once.\"  Go on, buddy. Try and enjoy that, what do they call it, a Large N' Delicious? A Royale With Cheese?   Yeah, I'm sure you like it going in, let's see how you like it coming back out.  Your stomach/intestines aren't fooled. It wants the good shit. It's not going to settle for this \"McBullshit\" you're trying to feed it.  Just deal with it. You've been bought and paid for by Lenny's Burger Shop.   You are Bitch Numero Uno.  Awww, don't cry. Ronald McLittleKid'sNightmare didn't like you anyway. But Lenny's Burger, Lenny's will always love you. It will always be there for you. It will never judge you, and will even forgive this little \"selling out\" phase you went through. It's okay. We all make mistakes.  Now...would you like cheese with that?  Hopefully today you have learned something, and understand the downward spiral that is consumption of actual food.  Be good, stay in school, listen to your parents, and remember, what doesn't give you high blood pressure and diabetes will only make you stronger."}

{"text":"Worst service anywhere went thru drive thru and girl didn't put lid on soda and spilt all over my lap she just laughed and asked for a manager what a freak, sated accidents happen need a extra napkin ? Really  Will never go back"}
{"text":"Sign on the door says they are open at 10:30. There were people inside but they were having nothing to do with me when I knocked. Disappointing because I have a short lunch that's starts at 11. :/"}
{"text":"Step foot inside Lenny's and you'll know what it feels like to live in 1950's USA. This is an old-fashioned burger joint at its finest, serving nothing but good old fashioned burgers. Don't ask for foie gras on your burger here. No here, you'll get a juicy patty, mayo, onions, pickles and ketchup. Here you'll eat every single calorie and never regret a single bite. That's about all I can add to the reviews of Lenny's, but if you want a delicious, juicy old-fashioned burger, visit Lenny's."}
{"text":"Jose and Alba are AWESOME!! The best and fastest service ever. They got me in and out"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered double cheeseburger, onion rings and Root beer.  Good burger and fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Yay found a burger place nearby that hits the spot!  Went to check out this place because we had heard good things about it and just wanted a good burger. This location was relatively small and at the end of a strip mall. The menu is pretty basic with burgers, hot dogs, sides, and shakes. I ordered a double ranch burger (aka hamburger with mayo) and added mushrooms and Swiss cheese. I also ordered cheese fries, because I am a sucker for anything covered in nacho cheese sauce.  The bf ordered the chipotle burger (burger with chipotle mayo) and added bacon, of course. We spent about $16 for the both of us. The burgers were very tasty and had that grilled flavor to it.  Food is simple but definitely gets the job done if you want a good burger and fries. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"GREAT BURGERS!!! Wow this place is great. It's kind of got that hole in the wall feel but the food is unbelievable! I mean everything was amazing here!! How do I rank this place with \"6\" stars??!!"}
{"text":"Charbroil goodness!! Got the double combo country style, 1000 island. Awesome food fresh made to order. Got my meal quick and hot!!"}
{"text":"For anybody that wants the feel of a traditional diner from the 50s, 60s, and 70s Lenny's fits that bill. The food is appropriately tasty and filling. Their burgers are some of the best in town, as long as you're not looking for healthy fitness related food that is :)  And the chocolate peanut butter shake is amazing. My 7 year old son, who is a notoriously picky eater, recently had a burger shake combo and was in a total food coma by the time we got to our car. He now begs to go back (mostly for the shake, but he liked the burger too).  If you're downtown and feel the urge to splurge on something you know can't be good for you then head over to Lenny's!"}
{"text":"Horrible place. Ridiculous wait time (15-25 minute wait, we were the only customers) and very bad customer service. I've been to this place more than a dozen times, and the service never gets better. The food itself is bland, and overpriced. The place is a joke, go here if you want bad service."}
{"text":"I don't want to say the service was bad, but it wasn't good either. The cashier didn't even greet me, I had to say hello to her. She just stared at me, the only words that came out of her mouth was the price of my order. No smile or anything. Kind of upsetting, given the 50s burger shop theme they've got going, she killed the vibe. So, I dropped a star.  Aside from that, the food was made fast, and my burgers and fries were delicious."}
{"text":"In town at the Hilton next door for a business trip and found this place while looking for non-hotel lunch! Fast and friendly service with delicious diner style grub! Great value too...Double Combo with Chili-Cheese & Jalapeño added to the fries...for $11! Pics don't do it justice...come check it out for yourself..."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru on 1/29/15 at 4:59 pm. Had to wait 10 minutes. The fries were cold and the burger I ordered was small. You would think when a combo cost $9.79 cents you would get a descent meal, not at this place! Should have just gone to Smash Burger, or hell even Carl's Jr. That's the last time I go there."}
{"text":"YALL THESE MILKSHAKES  I am 100% a milkshake snob and Lenny's legitimately has the best milkshake I have had in a very long time. 10/10 recommend if you are looking for a QUALITY old fashioned milkshake! SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Super unique and cute burger joint! And they are really fast with your order! There seasoned fries are amazing! Love this place but there is not much seating!"}
{"text":"Really good burgers, reasonably priced in a pretty rough area. It won't win any awards for the decor. Limited seats but still worth it for the burgers!"}
{"text":"Always a great burger and the fry seasoning can't be beat! You can't go wrong with anything on their menu"}
{"text":"Still not the Lenny's I know and love. I now know why too. They re-heat previously cooked burgers to melt the cheese. I watched a total of 12 pre-made burgers be sent out. They tong them out of the little warmer drawer, place on the grill or griddle and reheat to appear hot and fresh. The burgers are tasteless, I mean nothing. I asked the less-then-thrilled cashier if I wanted a fresh burger can they do that? She said \"uh yeah it would take longer.\"   Doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"I must be on my burger kick again. I had one Saturday and again today.   Lennys is cool but I am always disappointed. The burgers are just too thin. The flavor is there, everything is fresh, the frys are good.   Maybe I should get a double from now on."}
{"text":"This location has been here since I was a kid, I remember going here when I was young and having delicious Milk shakes (they are not as great as they used to be but they are pretty darn good!) The burgers are good quality, fresh and tasty. The people who work here were very nice. I came to order for 5-7 people and they scrounged up some boxes and helped me situate everything, even offering to carry the food to my car. They were very informative and even appeased my several questions and special order requests. The only thing that irritated me was when I was doing this personal order run my friends wrote out their order per the website come to find out that some things are not made at this location they are at the other location. If that is the case, split up the menus or specify which location offers it because in the middle of me order 30 items i had stop and call and get updated orders, which only made your line a and wait times longer. Other than that I will keep returning as It is so yummy..... pricey but yummy."}
{"text":"I think your either a fan of Lenny's or not a fan.  I can't seem to understand what the \"fans\" are tasting when they eat at this place.    I went to this Lenny's again last week for lunch and and had there single cheese burger with a side of fries and drink.  The burger was overcooked and tasted like something you would get a burger stand on a street corner. The toppings were ok but my bun was smooshed since it was on the bottom of the bag.  The fries were plain, possibly pre-frozen.  I tried their Mexican burger on my prior visit based on some Yelp reviews and it wasn't much better than last week's burger.    Bottom line, I'm not a fan yet but it's beats going to the chain fast food places since there is not many places to go in this area.  BTW ~ I find it very hard to believe the burger in the cover photo was taken at Lenny's... there's no way."}
{"text":"Three starts isn't a bad thing. It's a solid three stars. A noble three stars.  My boyfriend and I found this place after looking for a burger joint in our area. More specifically, we were looking for something cheap but not as yucky as your typical fast food burger joint. Lenny's was the answer!  Lenny's is an unassuming, small burger place in a little strip mall off Central. Easy to miss as I know I've driven by this place a hundred times. The interior is reminiscent of a 50's diner. It's cute. It's cheap. Definitely worth paying like, $7 bucks for a combo. Far better than Wendy's or McDonalds. Don't expect this to be the best burger you've ever had because it won't be. But it will be yummy and filling. The chili cheese fries were good also, and a little birdie informed me their shakes and malts are fantastic.   My ONLY issue with the place is that on the website it says that everything is fresh and their sauces are made in house. I know the nacho cheese isn't made on site and the chili tastes like the Hormel canned version. They also make it sound like their bread is delivered daily... If someone says bread is delivered daily, I'm going to assume its coming from a local bakery and actually delivered daily. They use your regular,  run of the mill sesame seed burger buns that you order from Sysco or US Foods or Shamrock. It just sounds slightly deceptive. Obviously, I'm nit-picking. Everything was delicious. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Arizona Burger Tour: Lenny's Burgers  Judging Criteria:  First appearance: Smushed and lots of lettuce. A hint of the patty and cheese is leaking out. Not the greatest presentation, but far from the worst.   Flavor: Standard burger flavor. No one thing really shined. That said, it was consistent and fresh, something I do appreciate.   Meat to bun ratio: The patty was a tad small compared to the bun. It was also smothered in toppings. Normally, I wouldn't mind. With the small patty, this was more of an issue. I also had a lot of bun left after the party was gone.   Included extras (veggies / condiments): lettuce, tomato, dill pickles, red onion and a mayo sauce.  Price: $3.79  Grade: C = It's ok. Burger might be a little overdone, but still tastes well enough. If you're hungry, it'll do. Might not be worth the price.  You can follow the burger tour on Instagram at @RequiemofChaos"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch the food was great we got cheese fries cheese burgers and and shakes the staff was quick and friendly the only down side was that they don't have a restroom here so you have to go someplace else to use the bathroom but other than that it's great"}
{"text":"I ate at this location several years ago. I stopped going because the place was just too small and cramped and was not really enjoyable if you planned on eating there. After they expanded into the suite next door, I gave them another chance and have been there several times since. Today, at 1:00 pm the place was slammed and they had the second section closed so that they could clean it and get the restaurant ready to close. There was no place to sit, yet there was a whole section of empty tables that they would not let people use. There were alot of people in line wondering why a restaurant would do that in the middle of lunch. It does not make good business sense. Lenny, you were sitting with a woman and a young girl in one of the two top booths or I would have brought it up to you. There were alot of unhappy customers.  We had to sit at the tables that are sitting right by the door where everyone has to stand to order. Due to the lack of space, people had to set there food on our table so they could try to fill their drinks. At this point, my guest suggested we just take our food and leave.   The layout of this restaurant is horrible. No flow whatsoever. All the walkways are so tight you better hope that nobody else is trying to walk the other direction. I thought opening up the restaurant into the next suire would help, but it only helps if you allow people to sit there.   We won't be back, but I hope you take this into consideration before you lose any additional customers."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food burger joints.  This place almost makes fast food gourmet.  The burgers are pretty good and you can add almost any topping to your sandwiches: avocado, mushroom, bacon, various cheeses, etc.  And, the burgers are a good price, starting at about $2.30 for a single patty.  I've heard the chicken is also good but a bit higher priced.  Their shakes are GREAT!  They're the real thing, not like a fast food shake.  They're a bit pricier but the quality and taste is worth it.  If you're looking for food fast but don't want that factory produced fast food flavor, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Very delicious burgers, onion rings, and chicken strips. Shakes and malts are very tasty! Always made to order. Very kind customer service. Personally, I like it better than Smash Burger."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. But they sure are proud of their shakes. And I can't believe they charge .33 for their condiments."}
{"text":"Just picked up some food from Lenny's for the first time.  I got a burger and some cheese fries.  The food came out within 2 minutes, and was slammed down on the counter by a rude girl.  That was my first impression.  There was also no place near the drink station to throw away any trash, so people left straw wrapping paper all over the place and no one cleaned it up.  I decided to throw mine away in the trash can near the door, which was covered in endless amounts of grime because they haven't cleaned anything in months.  The place is a filthy wreck.  That was my second impression.  I live just down the street, at Clarendon, and got my food home within maybe 6 minutes.  My cheese fries were so soggy they turned to mush and fell apart in my fingers.  They were also cold, and had obviously been sitting somewhere for a while before they served it to me.  They were not fresh, and I have no idea how long they had been stored in that container.  The cheese tasted OK after I microwaved it, but the fries were essentially mashed potatoes and not fresh and didn't taste special at all.  I couldn't even pick them up with my fingers, they were like mud.  So, to put it simply, their fries sucked.  The burger, which somehow magically took 2 minutes to make, was under-cooked.  The ground beef was pink and tasted raw.  The cheap bun was wet and soggy and was coming apart in 3 places.  The fixins that go in the burger were all over the place and completely fell out all over my coffee table.  This had to be the single worst burger I have ever gotten anywhere, about as bad as a burger that gave me food poisoning a couple of weeks ago.    I microwaved the burger and tried to put some of it back together but it was in a million pieces, so it was impossible to enjoy it.  It tasted like every burger you've ever had at any crappy greasy spoon, literally nothing redeeming about it.  It was awful.  I don't understand how a place that is filthy, with rude service, which gives out mushy stale food, and under-cooked beef, is still in business.  It is possibly the worst burger joint I've ever been to.  From my first impression until I tried the food, all of it was wrong.  I normally go to The Stand on Indian School for my burgers, where they are perfect every single time.  Their burgers can't be beat.  I was in a hurry so I thought I would try Lenny's and I have to say it was damned awful, just awful.  I will never ever ever ever go back to that place again.  Everything was terrible, everything.  I don't get how the place is still in business.  Whoever the clown is who is managing that place needs to be fired."}
{"text":"Watch out for their prices. They have updated their prices and not updated their menu prices on other sites. (Facebook) menu tab shows prices lower then they charge.  When I spoke with management via text message, I sent him photos of his page and the menu having the \"old\" prices. The manager would not honor these prices they have advertised on their Facebook page even after seeing it was their error.  He stated they posted about price changes in their news feed prior. However never updated his menu tab price, which is naturally what a consumer would go to when looking for menu items/ prices.  Be careful about giving any money to this company as they can make up changes in prices whenever they want per the managers text to me.    Also the fries which were amazing are now subpar and not the same.   They lost a customer in me, and anyone I would tell to go there before, I will now tell them to stay away from this company."}
{"text":"I sometimes miss Portillo's of the Chicagoland area. I was more a fan of the fries, shakes, and burgers--not so much the hot dogs or Italian beef. However, Lenny's fills that gap in my life. It is not to say this is a dupe of Portillo's; yes, it has similar decor and menu, but Lenny's carries its own weight.  The shakes come in the usual flavors; but my favorite is the horchata shake. I've had others, but Lenny's figured a way so it doesn't taste like a cinnamon vanilla candle.  Burgers are great and ample-sized; I really can't tell the difference between regular mayo and their ranch mayo though. Toppings are plenty, but they use shredded lettuce. The fries are nice and crispy; I think they use beer-battered ones, but don't quote me on that.  They charge an extra 30 cents to use a debit or credit card. It's better to carry cash when you go here."}
{"text":"Very good spot to grab a burger, fries and soda in a quaint, old-school atmosphere.  Order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  My combo meal for lunch was a little over $8 and the burger and fries were both cooked perfectly.  The employees were friendly.  Parking can be a little tight."}
{"text":"We live near Glendale so I always love finding local places. This one is your classic burger dive, complete with vintage pictures on the walls. It's a good hangout place and the food is great. I'm addicted to their fries, and the burgers and malts are awesome. However, the prices are always a bit higher than I expect for a burger and fries. Plan on waiting if you come during a Glendale event."}
{"text":"I finally made in here to try out some of the finest burgers in Valley and was not let down.  The food here basically consists of burgers, hot dogs, fries and soda.  My five year old accompanied me and did enjoy the Vienna jumbo hot dog.  I had a double burger with Swiss cheese and mushrooms.  Quite good.  The burgers are cooked on the grill by two women in the front.  The burgers are cooked medium well - near perfect in texture and tastes.  I was happy with my meal.  The fries have seasoned salt and are not over done.  It is a fun place, however, with limited seating.  I would suggest bringing an appetite.  The food is heavy, but good.  The outdoor seating is adequate for most of the year, but once it gets past 100 it becomes challenging.  Enjoy...."}
{"text":"Whatever you do , dont go to lennys burger for a dipped cone.They will tell you they are out of choclate.They shut the machine down early so they dont have to clean it.false advertising.I have talked to the owner three other times about this.Obviously ,he has no control over the store ,nor does he care to put a manager in there at all times.I waited 15 minutes in line with two cars in front of me.The lady in front of me wanted to back out of line .She rolled her window down to ask me to please back up..They suddenly started talking on the intercom so she ordered..~If anyone else has this problem get in contact with me with dates and times..The owner told me he cant be their all the time and maybe i should go to dairy queen lol..This is coming from the owner,so just imagine what he teaches his employees.This has happened 4 xs..I will never set foot in a lennys burger...Super slow too with all high school kids running the place lol..I wish you could give a 0 for the rating they deserve it"}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Arizona. Love this place. It's clean and the people are great. The service is fast and everything here is amazing. My favorite is the double country with everything plus avocado. Boom!!!! Sometimes I can't help but get the two chilli dogs with onion and cheese. The fries are amazing but what you have to try is the milk shakes. Eeww wee. So good. This is a must try if you love the all American burger."}
{"text":"Nothing bad goin on here!  Driven past this place many times and always wanted to stop but the timing wasn't right.  Today though....  ordered the double ranch burger with fries.  Just hit the spot.  Huge diner style burger with all the fixins.  Once I started it, I couldn't stop.  It was really good. Fries are great too This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Really great burger joint!  Looking forward thank trying other items on the menu!  I have a feeling it will be a goth spot for me when I'm in phx for work."}
{"text":"We have been customers for years to Lenny's on 35th ave but lately the quality hasn't been the same. They must have changed their fries and they use to have the best customer service. The last 2 times we have been, we have felt like we have inconvenienced them when ordering. I sure hope they go back to the old ways... We certainly aren't giving up on them but if you are going to be a more expensive burger place, make sure the quality isnt compromised and customer service is there!"}
{"text":"Bad all around. Here's the summary:  Food: we had the cowboy burger, chili cheese fries and a drink. Burger was just meh. Somewhat tasteless with a hideously greasy onion ring on top. Fries were ok, nothing to write home about.  Service: blank stares from girl at register was a bit awkward. Ordering at the register is also awkward because it's also the counter eating area. Bad design and flow.  Lastly but most important. We arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday. First thing we noticed when we walked in were the chairs overturned on most of the tables. We thought this was odd since it was a full hour until they officially close. We (family of 4) sat in the section that has most larger tables. Just as we got our order one of the staff starts cleaning right next t us and placing the remaining chairs up on the tables around us. Then to top it off, she chains the section off!!! When we were through with our meal we literally had to unchain the section barrier to leave!!  This place is a disaster. Food sucks. Prices high and service abysmal. We so wish we would have ventured down the road a bit more to The Habit!! Ciao Lenny's! This family won't be returning."}
{"text":"Lenny's is within walking distance of my office so why did it take me this long to stroll on over for a burger? I had the Mexican Burger, full of onions and green chilis, a healthy serving of fries and a 32 oz'er for $6 - well worth it. We went at 11:30 and it was starting to fill up, but they take care of you quick. Next time, Chili dog, you're mine, all mine!!"}
{"text":"This place is on my way home from school so I stop there all the time! The best thing is they have huge ice cream cones for like 75 cents! And there chili cheese fries are awesome! There burgers are okay. I've had better but there's so many more things there that make it amazing!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers, but the fries here are the absolutel best. The shake was good, not great. The atmosphere is like a 50's-60's burger shop. Food comes out pretty fast so you're not waiting to long."}
{"text":"I love this place.... good Lenny's burgers and good customer service.  Every thing here is good."}
{"text":"Overall great tasting food for a fast food place.  Would recommend over the typical places."}
{"text":"A couple of days back I was headed for my regular Jack in the Box  and decided to drive past it in favor of this local chain.  Lenny's is sort of an icon in the valley.  The first two places I went to are now closed but they have opened several others, Some seem to be franchised and some seem to be the original owners.  When trying to Google them only some of the many locations actually show up on a website.  This particular location has been the one I have had lunch from for many years but this was the first time I had actually gone to get my own food.  Can you say dive? Don't let the first impressions walking in cloud your idea of the food.  It is solid family burger shop.  My favorite over many years is the teriyaki, mushroom, swiss burger and the one I had this trip was just as good as always.  For a while they went to an onion ring made with pressed and chopped onions but they have returned to one made with whole onion but not quite the same as way back when when they made their own batter.  At one time all the locations made their french fries daily from scratch but I do not think they do that any more.  This location has a breakfast menu but I am not sure all of them do.  I will continue to go here on a regular basis as I think they hold their own against many of the national chains for good basic burgers and sides. A solid 3.4."}
{"text":"I don't get the HYPE.  It didn't taste right.  Never going back"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood staple! Do you like milkshakes? Go to Lenny's! Love burgers? You found the right spot!"}
{"text":"When I came in I noticed something. A lot of chubby people at Lenny's Burger, a lot of chubby people. The menu has a lot items to choose from. I came here however for the 5 buck lunch ($5.83 if you're keeping score). I asked for grilled onions on the burger which would immediately come back to haunt me. They offer dippers which are various sauces (1000 island, cheese, lennys, fry sauce etc.) for 30 cents. At first you'd probably be like, \"30 cents!? You can't just make it free.\" But I get it. It's a way to minimize expenses. I'm not that put out. I bought the fry sauce. For those of you not from Utah or the surrounding states, fry sauce is best described as a 1000 island without the relish. It varies in its spices and ratios of mayo to ketchup to whatever but it's basically a poor man's 1000 island. It originated in Utah at Artic Circle. Anyhow my meal came out. The fries were fresh and lightly dashed with seasoning salt. The burger was tiny, but it was the value burger so what can you expect. They put fresh onions on it which was a bummer. I asked for it to be fixed and they graciously accommodated me. The turn around was pretty quick considering how packed the place is. Not so much the number of people but the poundage. When I got my burger and bit in the patty was very thin. I giggled when I noticed that the burger was pink in the middle. I don't mind the pink. It's a burger,  in my opinion it shouldn't be well done. I was just impressed how they were able to acommplish a medium rare burger that was the thickness of a York Peppermint Patty. The grilled onions were solid. The bun was fresh but a little smashed. It's a dive what are you gonna do. I'm willing to give it another chance. You know being a chubby person and all."}
{"text":"The office decided to have Lenny's for lunch today. We went on line to check out the menu... nothing! Oh well, it's a burger joint. So I asked for a cheeseburger w/ mushrooms. What I got was a steak sandwich with cheese and mushrooms (a poor replica of a philly cheese steak without the peppers and onions). The steak was over-cooked and I could hardly find the cheese. The only flavor this sandwich had was greasy. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I. Love. Lennys. The burgers have a similar flavour to that of burger king, but you know what? BK can go suck it because their food will never be as good. Their burgers are amazing and their French fries with the seasoning salt are to die for. I wish I had one right now!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge burger person but I love the fries (even as greasy as they always are) but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Onion Rings. They aren't overly battered and they are perfectly crispy and always just a little sweet. AMAZING!  My guy loves the burgers here, so whenever we get a chance we stop here.  My obsession with the onion rings is perfectly normal and rational, I'm not strange at all. :P"}
{"text":"I've been driving by here for the past year and a half, pretty cool from the outside. Stopped and walked in today for lunch, my coworker and I. The decor is pretty cool, like back in Fonzie time on Happy Days! Ordered a double burger and fries, not bad.. I would definitely come back again! Prices are not bad and good service.."}
{"text":"This place is legit! If you want a real old school diner with great food, this is the spot! Cheap normally isn't a good word but this place is reallly affordable and you get a lot for your money. The manager there, Rodolfo will bend over backwards to make all his customers happy! He needs a raise!!"}
{"text":"Trying the cowboy combo this time. Friendly service and great food...love it!!  Will definitely be back to try other burgers."}
{"text":"Pro: good onion rings  Cons: bland burger           subpar service  I'm hoping this was an aberration, because I have heard good things about this Lenny's location.   As I pulled up to the drive thru and heard \"be with you in a moment\" followed by 2 minutes of silence, then after I yelled \"YO!\" at the talk box got a response from another employee and finally 2 more minutes later pulled up to the window. It took me almost ten minutes of waiting to get my drive thru meal. Girl with the drive thru mic boom on seemed more into eating and texting than serving this paying customer. Kinda seemed like a place where they'd spit in your food, honestly.  If I am going to wait ten minutes, I'm taking my drive thru bidness to In N Out or I'm going to walk into Smashburger or Five Guys where the food and service are both far superior."}
{"text":"How this place rec'd an overall 4 star rating I don't understand. The burger was mediocur at best, fries were average fat not crispy, we tried to order a shake and were told the shake machine was closed?!?!  It was our first trip and we felt very rushed ordering. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"First time here. Did not disappoint. Great burger. Too often burger joints disappoint. My #1 combo lived up to the yelp reviews.   Very good fries. Friendly, fast service. Came at 1230, long line, had my food at the table within about 10 minutes of walking in. Don't let the lunch line scare you away. It almost sent me elsewhere. I would've missed out."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great burger. And to top it off the fries are amazing. Figured they would be soggy with Uber delivery sitting there for a bit but they were still hot fresh and salty. I tried a few burger places on Uber and I won't be back. Until I tried Lenny's. Everything is great! Another thing I liked was the owner responding to some negative comments I noticed, The fact that he took the time out says a lot and goes along way. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"One of my all time places... this has been a spot of mine since I was 11 years old.. I'm 40 now you do the math... Came her after my AGS games either celebrating in victory or licking wounds from a loss in my favorite Chocolate Strawberry milk shake chilli cheese fries  cheese burger lettuce pickles ketchup mayo... it hasn't changed, owners have but the food has stayed the same. ..  This place is a must eat at..."}
{"text":"The southwest pastrami burger is excellent. I'm giving 4 stars and debated 3 because the place inside itself is not well kept. It's very dirty and I almost just want to run out with the food if I look around too long. Saying that. ..I'll give 5 stars if it gets a serious deep cleaning."}
{"text":"2 things always come to mind when I think of this place, comfort food & yummy for my tummy :)   This is not the place to go to if you're watching your calorie intake or want something on the fancy side BUT they have great burgers & I love the seasoning on the fries ( might be paprika? ). If I don't feel like cheating on my Coke with it's bitter rival, Pepsi, I indulge in a delicious strawberry milkshake ;)"}
{"text":"Lenny's is the new and improved McDonalds for me. I stepped into this cute, hip diner and ordered the Mexican burger combo: fries and a large drink. Total = less than $9! NICE!  You order to the counter, self serve your drink and pick up order. Have a seat and go at it like you haven't eaten for days - that's what I did! The sauteed onions on the burger were yummy. The poblano chiles were a different story - I had two big fat pieces! It was kind of hard to bite into the burger without grabbing one big piece out! I wish they cut them in pieces!   Still, a good place to get a quick burger for less. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went in the other day with.a friend for lunch and had an amazing time with the traditional burger and fries!"}
{"text":"Not a bad burger! I had the cowboy and fries. The employees were extremely nice and helpful!  Very clean restaurant people walked in as they locked the door and they welcomed them without question."}
{"text":"Oh Lenny, you're so smart. You probably have a 4 million dollar chateau on Camelback Mountain because of this place. Its an -effing GOLDMINE!  Your basic sloppy-but delicious burger joint. 50s garb on the walls. It looks like its wrapped in tin foil. Great spot for lunch. I think it's outstanding because I just happened to \"forget my wallet\" and someone \"got me.\" Also too, (haha).... it's busy, busy. A great buzz inside of happiness. In addition of the record breaking 2 minute wait for your magical feast during lunch hour its hella cheap son.  Grab plenty of napkins. Yes, you will be making a mess. Then, make friends with people around you. Seating and space is minimal. You may be sitting on the IT guy's lap."}
{"text":"Conveniently located next to the Glendale Court, this Lenny's is not nearly as flashy as the one at 59th Ave & Peoria. (To be honest, I'm don't know if/how they are connected).  In my mind, Lenny's is the Arizona equivalent to the celebrated Coney Islands in Detroit (where I grew up). Okay, so they definitely don't  have the Greek food, but they are perfect when you're looking for a tasty burger and fries or milkshake at lunch.  At this point, I usually stick to the cheeseburger, fries, enormous drink combo... which currently runs about $6. I've never been disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, Lenny's isn't going to win awards for presentation, atmosphere or originality... but what they do, they do well and I much prefer them over fast food."}
{"text":"This was the worst burger I have ever eaten in my life.  It was way overcooked - dry - like leather.  I couldn't be paid to eat here again.  I really don't understand the high reviews."}
{"text":"Good burgers, zucchini and root beer floats.  I hit up the drive thru and grabbed some food and for the place looking like a bit of a dump i was pretty impressed with the food.  I will definitely go back and try some other stuff!"}
{"text":"Top notch diner fare, best of it's kind.  Burgers were fast, juicy and tasty!  I had a double burger, double cheese, with bacon and fries.  By the time I got my drink filled, the order was up.  Great service considering it was the lunch rush.  Tough to beat that!  Fries were crispy and delicious.  Restaurant was sparkling clean.  Service was immediate and friendly.  I will be back (not too often, I'm on a diet! :-)"}
{"text":"Burgers do not get better than this! My hubby and I stopped by at 11 am today for lunch. We ordered 2 specialty burger combos. Loved being able to see our fresh food cooking. Ambiance is lacking, however, which accounts for the 4 instead if 5 stars. The dining room is not connected, so it seems kinda strange. Fries are not the best I have ever had, but the burgers are the best!"}
{"text":"Very, very, very good burger. The burger wasn't \"heavy\" on the stomach at all. The sweet potato fries were good but the chocolate shake was only average though.  It was super crowed but my food only took about 5 or 6 minutes. The ambience has a throwback 50's feel to it.  If I'm in downtown Phoenix I'll certainly look these guys up. It has the taste of a burger that's made by your uncle that's the best grill master in the family!"}
{"text":"Great burgers !!! One of the best I have had since I have been here in Phoenix. I love the ranch burger..a regular cheeseburger but they add a mayo/ranch concoction. Its too good. They always have a meal deal for $5.95 that includes fries and a drink."}
{"text":"I came here with my daughter per her advisement that I would fall in love with the burgers here. We came on a Thursday during lunch time and the place was packed!! We both ordered a double cheeseburger and then made one a combo meal, we shared the fries and drink. By the time we found a seat at the counter our food was ready ( about 5 minutes ) I was impressed that they got it done so fast. When I took the first bite and the cheese and the juice from the burger patties started to run down my face and hands I knew I was in love. The burger was juicy and flavorful and the fries were very hot and crispy. I was barely able to finish the burger, but it was soooo good I had to eat it all.  We watched them make the burgers while we sat at the counter and were to see other types of burgers to give ideas of what to get next time. Our bill came to only $11.07 and we were both stuffed for the rest of the day. I will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"If your looking for great burgers and service this is definitely the stop for you! My go to is the sourdough burger, seasoned steak fries and one of their amazing shakes! Love when Junior is working as he is always friendly and puts a smile on everyone's face. So stop reading and go order a combo... You will thank me later!"}
{"text":"Service sucks, burger was soggy and  fries we way salty--- def too expensive... Hate to post this cause I've heard so much good stuff about this place."}
{"text":"This is original location of a wonderful family run '50s style diner chain. Right on tram line it can get a bit packed in the afternoon with school kids, and packed at lunch with local employees but the food is always delicious.  They have some seriously huge burgers, though their buns don't quite hold up well to the grease. I love their ham and cheese which is piled high with black forest ham and absolutely oozes cheese and ham grease. The fries are simple and could be better but they offer options like chili fries, cheese fries, and mixtures of the two (even with bacon).   The place has a very '50s feel and is great if you're looking for diner faire. Great burgers, shakes, sandwiches, and more interesting options like Frito chili pie, chili dogs, and piled up French fries. Though be warned, eat quickly because the fries and buns definitely get soggy fast."}
{"text":"I'm new in town and this was my first visit to Lenny's. It was linch time and mildy busy. The staff was friendly, the food was reasonably priced, fresh and tasty. I love that they have sweet potato fries and multiple dips for them. Simply classy burger joint, I will return."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want a little shame.  I want to look at my meal and say to myself \"seriously? You think that's a good idea?\" That's usually the time that I dive into something like Lenny's.   It's definitely not a health food spot.  I usually get the Mexican Burger which has green chile and lots ooey gooey goodness on it.  The fries are always delicious and I firmly believe that they are sprinkled with crack.    The hours kind of suck, the AC doesn't seem to work that well, and the ordering/seating is a bit of a cluster *&^# but it just can't be beat for a hangover burger."}
{"text":"The food is good here I enjoy the burgers. I believe they're a little high-priced. But I come back because it's good. But this is the second time that I've shown up at 10:35 and they're still closed. A little frustrating since I like to eat early and this particular Lenny's opens at 10:30 a.m."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST burgers in town. I'm not big on burgers but I loved the burger I got. It was amazing I will be coming back for sure.  I also love that it's  family owned with Very fast service. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Though the prices were a little high for my meager budget, it was freakin' delicious. I can't wait to go back and try their other menu items. I also love the old time burger shop feel to it without that trying-to-hard look, like a lot of diners."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. We have liked everything my family has tried on the menu and feel the prices are fair for the large portion size."}
{"text":"Well burger fans I finally tried Lenny's! I know they have had some mixed reviews. I like this location! Everything is cooked to order. You can watch your food being prepared, it is a very small location. I started off ordering a cheese burger and fries. But after viewing the cook preparing the burger I opted for a double with bacon! The bacon is crisp and heated on the grill yahummmm! The fries were good nothing spectacular. But that burger was tasty!   Also they offer turkey hot dogs for those of you who cannot or do not eat beef or pork. This is a nice option. My best friend cannot eat beef or pork so this is great for her.   Only downside is the have no real seating here, but get it to go and you'll be A-ok!"}
{"text":"It's been almost a decade since we were here last, and this place is still awesome! Great food, great atmosphere, great staff! One of our favoriteburger joints!"}
{"text":"Great customer service.  Delivery was quick and very polite.  The shakes were delish but the burgers were not my favorite.  That is not to say they were bad, they just weren't my favorite."}
{"text":"Awesome little burger spot! Fresh made onion rings. Milk shakes of so many flavors and nice people running it."}
{"text":"Food's good, but I reckon Lenny makes his cashiers spend their breaks poking each other in the eye.  Why else would all the cashiers be in such a bad mood?  Peanut butter chocolate milkshake is the only reason to come back."}
{"text":"Cheap for a reason. Came in at 2:30. Not busy, stepped right up and ordered. Simple: chili dog, fries and a drink. Chili dog came out fast enough but was told frys weren't done. Ok, no worries.  They completely forgot about my fries. Almost do with my dogs then had to ask for them."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good old fashioned hamburger or hotdog then look more, this is the place. Lenny's has that old 50's dinner appeal and good portions of great American food. The staff are more than friendly and know how to treat a customer."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in a long time. Everything is super fresh.  Very high quality for a great price."}
{"text":"Their burgers and fries are so good, always passed by and happened to see all the good reviews on yelp, so finally gave them a try.  Probably would do take out next time - not a great place to eat in at.  Everything was so fresh tasting and service was so fast.  Can't wait to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is a little.....a lot greasy and I feel a little sick afterwards from congesting all that oil. Not someplace I would recommend have had food from other locations and the same thing. Great lemonades though!"}
{"text":"LENNY the man, the myth, the legend! This place is the best mom n pop burger shop in Phoenix! Lenny takes pride in his business, fun atmosphere, friendly happy staff and a delicious menu full of guilty eats n treats!   I'm not sure why people gave this place poor reviews? If you're looking for a healthy salad, this isn't the place for you. If you want the classic burger, hot dog, root beer float served with a side of old timer nostalgia this is deff the place to go!"}
{"text":"Lenny's Burger Shop is completely magnificent! They have a distinctive taste to it at! The frys are outstanding as well! I absolutely love going here for the food!!"}
{"text":"Remember that scene in  \"Harold and Kumar\" when the finally get the burgers and it's amazing?   That's what eating at Lenny's is like. When you show up during the lunch rush, it's a madhouse. Fire, meat, people yelling, the smell of fries, it's amazing.  The  metal walls with neon and 50's pictures help increase the awesome of this restaurant.   They serve up a decent amount of food, from chicken, to burgers, to shakes and cheese fries. This place is very \"diner\", and I have always had great food here."}
{"text":"Always a good spot for me & the boys to get our burger on. Good food, good service & hot girls to top off the eye candy. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Went and looked on the internet for the best tuna melt sandwich,  and they said Lenny's Burger Shop.  Boy oh boy!!!!!!!!!!!  That tuna melt sandwich was the worst  sandwich I have ever had.  I should sue google!!!!!  Subway is 10 times better.  I will never go there again!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This was like a blast form the past. We really liked the old-fashioned décor and general makeup of the place. Our only issue was that at lunch-time, the kids form the local high school descend, order sodas, etc, and fill the place, standing between all the seats and become rather annoying. Like, there was an ass at our table (that wasn't ours) Guard against this and you get the 50s sock hop music and feel that isn't easy to find in the Phx area. The burgers were excellent, and so many to choose from you will be confused which to try first."}
{"text":"Lenny's was exactly what I expected.  Waited less then ten minutes for a killer burger.  it is one of the few places that i will get nacho cheese to dip fries in.   They have a bunch of other great sauces to choose from too. Personal burger rating. 7 of 10."}
{"text":"No. 1 favorite burger joint in Phoenix, or possibly ever. Everyone has their favorite burger, and it's could be for any number of reasons. Lenny's is just mine. It's not like restaurant style, $12 burgers for fast food pricing or anything, it's just good! I always get the Country Burger because it's got the 1,000 Island dressing that can't be beat. Always comes with a generous portion of delicious fries that are huge and amazing.  It's honestly a tiny little place, but maybe that's what makes it awesome. The best little hole-in-the-wall burger spot. It's hard to explain why I love em but I do. Five stars for being awesome Lenny's Burger!"}
{"text":"I eat here pretty regularly and quality of food and service is consistently great.   They call you by your name and everything is cooked fresh.  I literally have nothing negative to say, even their mayo is homemade!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was little. The service, quality food, and menu has not changed since! They have delicious burgers and fries. My favorite is the Tasty Burger which has lettuce, tomato, cheese, red onions, mustard, and ketchup. Their fries are to die for! The fries are crisp and always fresh with a paprika salt seasoning on them. The restaurant itself gives a traditional burger joint vibe: friendly and comforting. I like this restaurant location in comparison to the other ones for a number of factors: taste, service, atmosphere, and menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I walked over to Lenny's today and we were very pleased. We had a country burger, a hickory burger, and chili cheese fries. I liked his country burger better than the hickory. They top the country with their homemade thousand island dressing, which was delicious! The patties on the burger are mediocre, they seem to be the ones you buy frozen, they are not hand made.  I also had a malt. I am a chocolate malt lover, so I was disappointed when the malt didn't have that distinct grittiness that I love.  The best part of Lenny's, by far, is their fries. They are the best I have had in a long time.  Next time, I plan to try their onion rings with the homemade thousand island dressing, I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Been going here for decades - I always get the same thing:  Double cheeseburger, country style, tomato only and an order of fries.  Food is excellent.  I can't recall a bad deal in all this time.  Probably ate here about 100-150 times in 20 years.  Love a good burger with a crispy char and it's here!  Smallish operation, I usually get mine to-go.  Always clean."}
{"text":"Awesome burger shack, makes me feel like im bak in cali. Finally a real burger that tastes great ald also other food. Fairly priced good shakes n others. Nice atmosphere 1950's layout. I would definitely come again. Fo sho!!"}
{"text":"We had are choice between this Lennys or the one off of 59th.  We chose this one because we get a $1 off each combo. Later in the day we just happened to drive by the one on 59th and wished we went there instead.  We walked up and there was a big cloud coming out the , i thought it was a water mister but it was the smoke coming from the grill. It was crazy, we walked in and you couldnt see 2 feet in front of you.  We all order burgers of course and some fries. There was no complaints and we would go back. My aunt came with us and she use to live a few miles from here, years ago and she said she use to come here every once in awhile. Im guessing 20+ years.  They have a small room to eat in next door."}
{"text":"WOW!  This must be the best Lenny's burger shop that I have ever been.  The dual ordering center is a major plus.  Burger still good but the chili dog is off the hook!!    oh and dont forget the shakes.  to go. . .. .   :)"}
{"text":"Got to say food quality taste wise not the best, this place is more of five guys without the great taste. It is a diner so you got the low end diner feel which is fine, food does comes out fast. I got a triple burger , chili fries and another burger for the annoyed girlfriend , it came out to about 17.50. Once again 5 guy prices but my issue is this. There are alot of great food places around this place along with a five guys (reoccurring theme) which are in the area. In my opinion spend your money at one of those. But this place is much better than drive through fast food. But I just might be spoiled when it comes to a good burger."}
{"text":"If you want to get away from the standard burger from chains, this is your place. Fries are crispy with good seasoning. Burger I got was the country. Upon the first bite I was actually not impressed, maybe because my mouth didn't know wtf I was doing steering away from the usual quick nasty bullshit. I then dived in more and found its actually quite delicious. Prices is same roughly as a McDonald's or whatever. They actually cook their meat, that actually taste like meat, that's a nice change. Overall good and whatever. If you know Spanish ordering is a simple task, but they know English too so don't worry. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"It was one of those days where was looking for something tasty that would clog your arteries.  Well I ran into Lenny's while running errands around town.  I did enjoy this local chain.  Very standard traditional burger place that offers chili fries, dogs, and all kinds of burgers.  It's designed to be a drive through place, esp on the weekends.  I thought their garlic swiss burger was very tasty and fresh (although a bit too much mayo).  Fries are thick cut and crunchy.  Service was fairly quick.  This is a good burger place to go if you are craving a burger!"}
{"text":"Uh, still amazing. Clearly. But...tried the Mexican Burger and it is possibly the best burger I've ever had. Order it."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The two young boys working the front are extremely rude, unprofessional and can not take orders.  My order was wrong, after repeating it several time and reiterating it again at the window when they tried to hand me drinks that I didn't order.   Then got home and the order was wrong. When I called to speak to the manger the boy said he was the supervisor for now,  the other boy is in the background saying \"I want to hear what she says\".   I asked the kid when would the manager be in but the boy claimed he didn't know. Not only is the customer service horrible the food is too.  The hamburgers are soggy and fall apart.  Go up the street to smash burger better burger better service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day, the fries weren't that great but their burgers were delicious. Although, I added avocado to my burger and it was a mistake. Their avocado was mushy and just tasted awful! That was pretty disappointing. Pretty pricy for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Great food from what I remember but just waited 20 minutes and they couldnt even take my order!"}
{"text":"Their food is really good. The fries and strawberry shake are bomb. The only reason why i don't give them 5 stars is because they take FOREVER in the drive thru. I've gone several times and they literally take 15 mins just for 1 combo."}
{"text":"This place is Hella pimp. My daughter and I destroy there Horchata Milk Shakes like a couple rabid banshees."}
{"text":"I honestly do not know why this place has the rating it does.  The wife and I went to the other location first, as she wanted to try the tuna melt.  After waiting in line, my wife ordered the tuna melt. The cashier then informed us (with a bit of attitude) that they don't have the tuna melt.  We then drove to this location, as we were heading to that part of town anyways.  They have the tuna melt.  My wife ordered it with onion rings (which they did not give us, they rang it up for fries instead....  After waiting fairly long, we finally got out food, sans the onion rings. Since the place was so slow on getting the food out, we just let it go.  The burger was boring, nothing special. Same with the fries as well. Honestly, In and Out is the same money, and tastes much better. There honestly was nothing flavorwise that stood out our entire meal. It is just another boring burger joint trying to cash in on nostalgia.  The reason I am only giving them two stars? The place was NASTY dirty. I nearly slipped on some ketchup that was all over the floor in front of the register. The cashier seen this, and did nothing.  The area where the drink machine and condiments were - was disgusting. It looked like it had not been cleaned once that day. There was spilled ketchup, sticky drink residue, etc all over the area.  They had both areas opened up, and finding a clean table was a challenge. I do not think they had anyone that was cleaning tables. The floor was filthy as well. My wife said it was so bad, if they gave her a mop she would even be compelled to clean it.  If I had to use the restroom, I would have held it - because with as poor shape as the main areas were, I would hate to see the restrooms.  It was a good value, well priced - albeit nothing special. However the absolute lack of any effort in keeping the place clean will ensure we never return."}
{"text":"I don't know if I got a precooked burger or what but the last time I ate here for lunch it was terrible. Everything tasted how I expected except the meat inside hamburger. The patty was thicker than usual and very dry and chewy. It tasted like a school cafeteria burger. I hope Lenny's hasn't cut quality but the burger I had did not taste like a Lenny's burger. Very disappointed. Culver's or Wendy's has much better tasting beef. I don't know what happened to Lenny's."}
{"text":"Why on earth would anybody in central phoenix eat at any of the fast food burger chains, when Lenny's Burger Shop is right in the center of town? The place serves up a fantastic quick burger for a very low price.   For just $6.75, I had a Mexican Burger Combo. The beef is wonderful and the burger is topped with grilled Onions, green chilies and jack and cheddar cheese. The only thing I didn't care for was the mayo. I thought it was very unnecessary to slab mayo on both buns, but I am not a mayo lover like most people are. This beats anything that Five Guys, In & Out, McDonalds, Burger King or Jack in the Box offers.  High quality food, low price.  The fries weren't all that special, but there are countless options of upgrades (including onion rings and sweet potato fries) which I'll have to try sometime.   The place screams all American 50's dinner. All red and metal. This is the kind of place you see in movies like \"American Graffiti.\" The only negative is the location and parking lot. Because of the light rail in the middle of Central, it's hard to get in and out. The lot is also very small for the amount of businesses located in the plaza. I Could see it being a pain to navigate during a busy weekday lunch rush.  There's a huge menu of good cheap food.  If you're looking for a classic burger, hot dog, and fries...  Look no further than Lenny's!"}
{"text":"Lenny's, why do you offer me such easy access???? Why!?!? All I have to do is walk across the street and there you are, calling me with your wonderful sights and smells. And really the cost if your meal cannot be beat!   You can probably feed two with some of the burgers they offer but you may get greedy as the burgers are absolutely delicious! Customize your burger stacking your toppings sky high or order one of the combos. Don't forget onion rings! Yummy!"}
{"text":"They charge for ranch when you order fried zucchini's. Its about the principal not the money.there prices are high enough to give a lil side of ranch seriously. The original lenny on 1-17 and glendale does not charge if you order a special appetizer."}
{"text":"Good quality patties and amazing fresh French fries. Recommend this place if you like a good burger n fries."}
{"text":"I would first off like to start by saying their burgers are incredible however I got one of these crunch dipped ice cream cones and they have to put it in a cup because ice cream was too soft this is like ice cream soup okay ice cream crunch soup that's what I have in this cup I don't ever want to see any mess like that again so I decided I would just talk about it otherwise their customer service was good the food was amazing it's just this soup ice cream is unacceptable"}
{"text":"$20 got my husband a truly man sized burger \"cowboy\" burger, me a single, large well seasoned fries (best I've had since leaving Idaho!), large drinks, and a 32 oz Oreo shake. Food was amazing, they lost a star because its toted as a family place, but there was very little seating for more than two, and a lot of foul language. Atmosphere needs a bit of work, but the food... AMAZING. no questions asked, one of the best burger joints I've visited!"}
{"text":"Great little burger place come here quite often. They have pretty good staff and pretty good burgers also. Just a cool place To go for a good burger wether you get there during the day or right before they close the doors the food never disappoints. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best cheeseburgers around. French fries are also perfectly cooked always! Super fresh. Cant go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"This burger SUCKS. I love a good burger, believe-you-me, and have been searching for the best burger joint in Phoenix for awhile now. Yelp sent me to this place and let me say, this is a MEDIOCRE burger at best. It's a crappy pattie, on a crappy bun, with all the crappy fixin's you'd find at a cafeteria. I mean, In-N-Out is better than this place for cryin out loud!   Frozen fries, a GIANT soda, and a crappy burger ran me right around 10 bucks, and nothing was very appetizing. I understand the nostalgia for a place like this, but c'mon. Lenny's doesn't even belong in the conversation for \"best burger in Phoenix\". I did notice several other patrons getting the hot dogs and chili dogs and whatnot, and if (and that's a big IF) I ever make it back here I certainly won't be having the burger. Very disappointing Yelp, very disappointing indeed...."}
{"text":"First time in, this place has been highly recommended. Ordered the Mexican burger and onion rings. Super disappointed to see frozen chicken strips and onion rings pulled out of boxes in front of me, I guess I'm a snob for freshly made. The burger wasn't much to look at, I normally take pics of my food but it looked kind of sad. The first bite made all of my apprehension about this place disappear. They make a fine damn burger. Onion rings were solid as well. I will be back"}
{"text":"Lenny's is an institution. Always good. Classic food. We love the fact that it's handmade and they cook and prepare it right in front of you."}
{"text":"Great service from Lenny Himself . The cowboy burger is delicious . Onions rings are delicious . Highly recommend"}
{"text":"These burgers are bawlinn! So good and easily the best ive had so far in the Phx area. Homie on the grill can whip up one mean burger!"}
{"text":"Good no frills local burger joint. Burgers are decent. Nothing amazing, but better than the regular corporate fast food places. Ok service. Meets expectations."}
{"text":"This place looks like it has potential from outside. And even when you walk in. Thinking 50's diner. Until you realize that it's a cheap imitation. Food is awful. There IS NO SERVICE. Order and pick up at counter. A bad hot dog. A poor kids meal. Management does silly nickel and dime things like 30 cents extra for a side of ranch for my pal's fries. Seriously, this place is a disappointment. Even the tunes are bogus and can't be heard. The decor is nice-if they carried through with a diner experience it could be great especially with the location and some interesting old school menu items. But..sadly, wait for Lenny to sell."}
{"text":"Saturday's trip made it out second to Lenny's.  The burger I had had WAY too much mayo on it.  Fries were good.  J liked his chili cheese dogs.  If we're ever in the area again, we'll probably go again.  And I'll probably try a different buger - and tell them to go easy on the mayo."}
{"text":"Best onion rings ever!  Milkshakes are insane.  Breakfast burritos are large and in charge.  Cheese fries are awesome.  Mushroom burger is not so good, kinda made me sick.  Veggie burger was dry.    Overall, it's a hit and miss at this place."}
{"text":"Do not get a burger here!!!!!  Love their shakes and fries. Used to love their burgers too but... I feel like the owner is using shady methods to extend product. The last two times we were there the burger toppings were super watered down. Both their BBQ sauce and their 1000 Island dressing were watery. When you bit into the burgers, it was like squeezing a sponge. Totally disgusting!!! We bought the first time this happened, that it was a fluke but then it happened again. The condiments were never like this about a year ago.  Will never eat a burger here again, they're gross!!"}
{"text":"Woot Woot!  That's what my belly says when I walk into Lenny's.  My arteries hate me, but my belly and taste buds love me.  If I could dive into a pool of ranch with Lenny's fries I would.  Their burgers are great, and their chicken sandwiches are amazing.  Those are the only things I have tried there, but I've heard good things bout the tuna melt also.    Its fast, small and slightly frenzied.  I ususally take it to go during lunch hour.  But you can sidle up to the counter like a real old-fashioned burger joint.  They also make yummy shakes and malts.  I swear, this is where you wanna go if you are breaking your diet.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the best place if you are looking for a greasy guilt filled cheeseburger. I highly highly recommend the party melt with thousand island dressing and American cheese. You won't be disappointed. Only thing that sucks is they close at 8. One night I had to settle for this nasty Pete's place instead because they were you closed. You let me down bad Lenny's! But anyway awesome dive feel and good food. I really need to try their shakes"}
{"text":"Get anything with chili and cheese on it. And don't skimp yourself on the peanut butter shake. It's like heaven in a cup."}
{"text":"Great food fun place. Paid $14.00 for lunch for  people, and I was full"}
{"text":"Lennys burgers and frys taste awesome. Although I was quite disappointed when i emptied out my soda in my sink and found a dead fly floating in it. So if you want good tasting food but don't care about expired insect carcasses Lennys is the place for you."}
{"text":"I'm really starting to wonder about you, Phoenix.  Usually, when I look at Yelp reviews and see that there are 20+ reviews and the place has 4 stars, that's a legitimate measure of how good it is, but since moving here, I've been to several places like this - some with even 50+ reviews - that are simply mediocre.  Are your brains so addled by the sun that you've forgotten what food tastes like, or is this just a symptom of the terrible offerings of Phoenix as a city?  I'm not sure yet. Lenny's is one of these cases.  I went in here expecting a home run from reading all these reviews, and I splurged and got onion rings and a shake based purely on your recommendations.  Sure, it was a well-put-together burger, and the options they have are fairly novel... but it was just okay.  The toppings were kind of meh, especially the onions.  But most importantly, the burger was extremely salty.  I believe I saw them putting some sort of powdered topping on them on the grill, which, fine, but... less please.  The saltiness really took the quality of the burger down for me.  Otherwise it would have been much more solid.  The saltiness alone reduces the chance of me returning. Service was fast, that's a plus.  It's true the location offers you little.  It's functional.  It's fine.  Whatever.  But the onion rings were frozen (so are the fries) and the blandest I've ever had in my life, so the guy below who said they were the best he ever had, well, I hope you get to have some better onion rings soon.  Considering this fact alone, I feel that Lenny's is a bit overpriced. The one part of all these Yelp reviews that is 100% unadulterated truth is that Lenny's has outstanding milkshakes.  They do taste homemade, and it's fantastic.  They have many flavors for you to delight yourself with, and they are sumptuous and indulgent without being too heavy.  I will almost certainly go back to Lenny's for a shake if not a burger."}
{"text":"Gone are the good old days of a sweaty, greasy Lenny himself taking your order and making it while you watch. Gone too are the days of equally sweaty, greasy and extra pimply high school kids doing the same. What remains is a no-frills burger shack in a mostly run down strip mall with some of the best cheap burgers you can buy.  I ordered my usual double ranch burger with cheese and fries. The burger was the same tasty pile of awesome that it's always been. Unfortunately the fries have changed. They used to cut them fresh in the store. I think they are using frozen or packaged fries now. They were not bad at all, just not as good as what I'm used to, so I had to knock a couple of points off of that.  I've been going here since my high-school days so I would give this location a lifetime achievement award of a perfect 5 stars. But since Lenny is no longer on the scene and the fries have changed, I gotta knock it down to a 4.5."}
{"text":"Great fries, burgers and shakes, fair prices. Very very friendly. Was very satisfied."}
{"text":"My husband is in love with this place & insisted I try it out as soon as I moved here. It's a small diner but I've never seen it too crowded, although we tend to go during non-rush hours. The food is pretty good and service isn't too bad."}
{"text":"This place is WONDERFUL!!! ok look no offense to anyone who lives in AZ but they don't know ANYTHING about a good burger. So Cal has a bunch of places like Lennys that I have missed since moving back to Phx. Prices are low, food is awesome, people are friendly and there's a drive thru!!! lol"}
{"text":"This place makes burgers the old fashioned way.  Be prepared to wait while they cook your burger after you order it.  Nothing premade and kept warm here.  The interior is tiny so take away might be better but the food is good and the price very reasonable.  I liked it but it isn't near to my fav burger place, 5 Guys."}
{"text":"This the best burger place in Phoenix! For the price of a fast food chain restaurant you get a huge delicious burger,fries and a drink! Highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"Been a couple times already, burgers are decent, chili cheese fries are the bomb, service progressively getting worse. I'll still go from time to time when my coworkers and I are bored of everything else in the area, but it isn't a go-to spot for me in the least."}
{"text":"Took my GF, it was cool nice decor....mind you this was a Monday Brunch time so I can see how it can get busy and hectic on the weekends/evenings, but very mellow when we went, we each had a burger (Mexican / Mushroom) fries, zuchinni drinks .....came to $20 didn't think that was too bad, the food tasted pretty good I think I'd go back."}
{"text":"After a 12 hour fast for blood work, I screeched minivan tires and headed up Central for a full tilt lunchtime pig out! For less than 10 dollars I stuffed my face with one of the best cheeseburgers and fries the city has to offer. If you like burgers, and let's face it, you're weird if you don't, Lenny's is a must have burger!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a couple of says and I love checking out the local restaurants. Stumbled across Lenny's, small burger joint, very good! Very fast, as you order at the counter and pick your food up when they call your number.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and chili cheese fries.  Both were very good and reasonably priced. The chili cheese fries were exactly what I grew up eating, chili with beans and melted cheese smothering the fries! Mmm mouth watering deliciousness in those fries!  Chicken sandwich has a great taste, perhaps the chicken was seasoned making it taste better.  The sandwich was a little messy to eat, but that's what makes the food so good.  You won't waste a bite.  Great job Lenny!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Lenny's Burgers but this location seems to be different than the location on 35 Ave and Thunderbird.  The hamburger patty did not taste charbroiled, the condiments on the hamburger were different tasting.  The fries were the same and tasty.  Bottom line, it is as if this Lenny's is something other than a Lenny's and we won't go back."}
{"text":"Mexican burger with green chili's with the onion ring fatties- one bite and you can see heaven! The last bite- I guarantee you'll think you just fell from heaven.."}
{"text":"One of the very few places to get a burger where the Meat actually takes center stage. I have loved Lenny's burgers for over 20 years, whenever I discover someone who hasn't eaten here, I take great pleasure in bringing them in for a really great burger.  Be patient, the place is small and the food is actually cooked, not run through a machine, so it takes a couple minutes. As opposed to some Yelpers opinions, I actually think the prices are quite reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  Tasted like an expensive restaurant burger but for a lot less.  Cashier is friendly.  Cook is fast."}
{"text":"Juicy, charbroiled, hamburger and hotdogs heaven! I had the double country burger with bacon, american cheese and avocado. My husband had the Polish dog with chili and cheese. Both were FANTASTIC! This is our new favorite place for burgers and dogs! Can't wait to come back and try the shakes."}
{"text":"Every Lenny's in the valley different. So if you like some of the others nearby with retro decor, or a good menu, you'll be sorely disappointed here.   First of all, the burgers themselves are pretty lame. It looks as though there's a variety, but they're mostly all the same, just with different sauces. I don't like traditional burgers, I like them to be a bit more creative: ex REAL cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, onion rings. None of that here, just cold toppings (including sauce), cold American cheese, cold bun...I've never had a good one here, and the fries taste as though they're cooked in old oil. Way too salty.   Literally the only two things I like to get are the BLT, which is miraculously executed well, and the banana cinnamon shake, which is admittedly my favorite shake anywhere, ever. If you're willing to drop a few more bucks, go elsewhere before it's too late."}
{"text":"Lenny's is a great regional chain you should consider in lieu of places like Five Guys and Smashburger. Fries are thick-cut with seasoned salt, beer-battered onion rings are perfect, and the 50s music in this location might drive you crazy.   Every Lenny's seems to be a little bit different, but they all do the same things well. I love the banana shakes, and the BLT sandwiches. Here, it's a ranch BLT with sourdough. It sounds like messing with perfection but is worth a try.   You can get a burger on just about every block in this town. Why not show a little love for your home by keeping it local?"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant style burgers. I always get the burger with BBQ sauce,onion ring, cheese, and bacon it's great. Only draw backs are that they are pretty slow sometimes and soggy buns occasionally wich is disgusting."}
{"text":"Yum lennys. This one is not my preferred Lennys location, but still decent. The inside could use some updating and so could the menu."}
{"text":"Lenny's is great little spot. The restaurant has a family-feel, like they care about you - unlike a corporate-run chain. I had the Mexican burger (grilled onions & green peppers, ranch [I think...] and cheese) and was very pleased!"}
{"text":"Will never return! Super thin burger and way overpriced for what you get. The fries were just ok and the cheese on my fries was the cheese from a can -- yuck! The onion rings were $2.59 and you get 6 total and they were frozen not fresh. Very disappointed overall!"}
{"text":"Best bacon and thousand island burger ever. Makes up for the long waits in the drive thru's all the time."}
{"text":"its been a while since I have been to a Lenny's burgers and the first time to this location. the young lady (i have included a pic of her with my review) at the register was super friendly, and very helpful, and seemed to been doing it all, another young man (think I was told his name was Jonan) ignored all customer cause he was to busy on his phone.    Lennys burgers use to be my go to place for a good burger at a good price, but I swear they need to teach them not to press all the flavor out of the burger and not over cook them till they are a solid dry puck.  Fry's were tasty and the shake was cold.   I just still cant recommend this place like I uses to,  there are so many other places to spend you hard earned $ for a good burger."}
{"text":"This was my first visit, but won't be my last!! Had the Ranch Burger, Fries and Chocolate Shake; amazing!! Cost was low enough (under $12) so it was no big deal to pay 30 cents for three different dipping sauces for the fries. Chocolate shake topped off the meal!!"}
{"text":"I do miss the days when Lenny would take the orders and be lambasted for doing everything wrong by the woman at the end of the line...  Ah, those were good days.  I'd never been to this location, and just so you know, there ARE more than the four bar seats next to the grill - just wait for your order, grab your shake, then head outside, turn right, and head into the much cooler (temp-wise, if not decor-wise) seating area.  You DID grab your shake, right? You mean, you didn't order a shake? Yeah, yeah - I know - you can't get a combo with a shake.  Splurge on the extra dollar and get the damn shake.  Cinnamon is one you can't get everywhere else.  Got it?  Good.  (Seriously. I'd be giving 3 stars without the shake.)  The burgers are good, flavorful, a little greasy, a little crisp on the edges sometimes, but always seem to hit the spot.  And I also recommend the onion rings.  I mean, you're not coming here because your trainer recommended it for your diet, you're coming for the burger, onion rings and don't-you-dare-forget - the shake.  Mmm.  Nummy."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers! Charbroiled goodness.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. However the establishment is a bit cramped."}
{"text":"These are the absolute best shakes I have ever had, well at least on this side of the country. The burgers are really good and the service is relatively fast and friendly. You might not want to eat in the restaurant, it is a bit cramped, and the decor is a bit gaudy. Oh yeah and they have a happy hour with half price drinks and shakes 2-5 everyday. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with many peers on the onion rings as they were great! The burger was good, but not what I thought it might be given the positive reviews. Definitely prefer 5 Guys burgers."}
{"text":"Let me just say that the food is absolutely wonderful! My second favorite burger place. Their fries are crispy and wonderful. Their ranch is pretty gross, so that definitely knocked some points for me. If you dine inside, it's absolutely disgusting. Like there are literally dead flies on the windows. There's mold on the floor. The seats look like they haven't been wiped in forever. The place just looks like it hasn't been cleaned in years. It makes me wonder if I should be eating at this particular Lenny's.. but here I am. I'd say go to a different location that doesn't have dead, crusted flies on the window seal. Food is great. Everything else, not so much."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Ordered a sourdough bacon RANCH no mayo.  Menu Says \"sourdough. Bacon, ranch, mayo, onion, pickles, lettuce\".  When burger came there was no ranch so I asked for a side of ranch.  Was told it would be .33 told him I ordered a RANCH sand which and he said yes but you ordered it with no mayo so would be .33 I said fine can I just have whatever comes on the sandwich? and after a 3 minute argument in front of 20 customers he gave me my ranch MAYO and said next time there will be a charge.  Should of went to smash burger."}
{"text":"Lenny himself takes my order and checks me out with jokes and a smile??  Sign me up!  Awesome place to grab a perfect burger and onion rings.  Everyone in my party of 5 thought it was delicious."}
{"text":"Highly recommend not only for great food, but excellent service! Thank you Jennifer for your kindnesses shown me and your dedication and concern over the satisfaction of your patrons! Well done all around! Will be back for more, and more! Best Wishes for continued success!"}
{"text":"DANGEROUSLY located across the street from my old work, I hold Lenny's burger shop directly responsible for those 5 extra pounds I put on while working there. This place was great. Juicy delicious burgers and seasoned french fries were a staple at this joint, but you would be surprised what else they did well! My favorite was the country burger combo. Killer milkshakes too. And if you work in the area, they started serving breakfast a couple years ago and the breakfast burritos are solid. Conveniently located right next to the Thomas lightrail stop."}
{"text":"A meal here is still 5 bucks more than what it would be at Wendy's or Mcdonalds. Also the fact that they don't allow free refills is interesting. The business probably pays pennies on the dollar for all their supplies , they own the space they're on , where is the high prices coming from? When prices go down I'll be more than happy to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years.      Haven't been here nearly as often as I would like to have been in the past few months but this place is still churning out great quality burgers.   Very basic, to-the-point menu, burgers, hot-dogs, fries and shakes.         For what they offer, they do very well.     The best out of all the Lenny's that I have been to, definitely the most consistent as well, I'd recommend this to anyone with a craving for a hot, juicy burger."}
{"text":"Man those burgers!  I was completely satisfied with my Mexican burger. Coming back again soon with the family.  Would get 5 stars if the A/C was ice cold on this scorching summer day."}
{"text":"This is a fun place to enjoy a delicious ample burger in a 50s style diner. And, yes, they have a veggie burger and it's great. Music from that era is enjoyed while you done. They have drive-thru service where you can enjoy a root beer float for 99 cents. There are also a variety of shakes, sundaes and ice cream treats available. You can also enjoy outdoor seating where, if you'd like, you can enjoy your food with your dog."}
{"text":"Best burgers in phoenix from a non chain. Love their sauces, zucchini and onion rings!"}
{"text":"The decor is great.  The burgers are cooked nicely to order.  It's a nice place to grab a quick burger and fries.  Right off Central you have to look closely to find.  The lunch crowd gets busy."}
{"text":"Adorable little place. Has two drive in lines and the Lenny burger single is amazing. My family also likes the hatch chili burger. You can't go wrong with this cute little place."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was 6, and still....hands down the best shakes in town!!!  I can't ever finish a whole burger, so the Little Lenny's are perfect!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Lenny's burgers! Simple and delicious."}
{"text":"NOM! I work right across the street from them and decided to skip the salad and go to Lenny's! It was a lot different inside than I had expected (it's in a strip mall) it was white and red checkered retro-style... Like a good old-fashioned burger joint SHOULD be! I had a \"build your own burger\" with Jack cheese, jalapenos, avocado and 1000 Island dressing. SO good, the fries were hot and crispy, too! It wasn't a grease bucket burger place, the burger was surprisingly not greasy at all. I didn't even feel as guilty as I thought I would because it was clearly good quality meat. Oh and Lenny actually exists, which I found pretty cool. (I've never seen Filibero or Wendy anywhere;)) The service was great, too. Everyone was so friendly even though it was during the lunch rush and they were slammed."}
{"text":"I eat burgers all the time, as well as garlic and mushrooms, never have any problems. Got the garlic mushroom burger here 6 months ago and felt extremely sick after. For some reason, I decided to give it another go... and felt pretty sick again. Wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Waaaaaay too expensive for a drive-through burger shop! $26 for two meals. I'd rather go to a sit-down at that price."}
{"text":"I find excuses to go into work just so I can walk across the street to enjoy a Lennyburger.  It's an addiction. I heard somewhere that addiction is defined as thinking you can't live without the thing that's killing you. In my case it's the delicious, complex flavors that only grilled beef can provide. Who cares if I have the arteries of a 60-year-old in the body of a 40-year old?  This place is the inverse of McDonalds or Burger King. You get the full flavor and none of that hateful aftertaste from either the burgers or the fries.  Still. . . .fat. . . .sodium . . . . gaahhhh  Oh hell, we're all going to die anyway."}
{"text":"Love this Happy Days themed restaurant.  Lots of cool pics on the wall of famous people that have eaten there.  I work nearby so I place orders via their website.  15 minutes later it's ready for pickup."}
{"text":"There cowboy burger is the best onion ring/ bacon burger you will ever taste!! It's a very unique place and good smoothies!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and that's the only real plus. The hours are terrible so going here without planning is impossible. They close at 7pm during the week and they close at 2pm on Saturday they are closed on Sunday. So if you get off work and can survive rush hour you will make it on time to be treated like a nuisance by the staff who just want to get out of there. Me and my friends arrived at 6pm sharp and when we walked in we weren't met with the smiles this place is known for we were met with looks of annoyance. The customer service was so bad that it made the dining experience unbearably awkward. The food was messy and rushed and just not worth the money. So word of advice if you're going to this establishment be there well before they close if you want the service and quality to match with what you pay for."}
{"text":"This is not part of the \"Lenny's Burger\" chain, they are much better. The burgers are grilled right in front of you. The burgers have an excellent taste. The lady's there are super friendly and quick. Definitely one of my favorite burger joints in the valley."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now. The quality has always been high. The food is fantastic and the burgers are some of the best in the valley.   It's a classic burger shop - cozy, simple, and they execute their menu perfectly.    Tonight I took my family for dinner. My wife and I had the Mexican burger as a double. We could barely finish it because it was huge. The grilled onion and green chilies were delicious.  I would have liked the chilies to be a bit hotter though.   As always the fries were well seasoned and you simply can't stop eating them."}
{"text":"Fast food eateries seem to have a wider range of \"loved it/hated it\" more than sit-down restaurants, likely because service and quality can vary more from shift to shift.  My first experience with a Lenny's was at the Glendale location.  I am always searching for the best burger on Earth, and rarely find it at chains, even 5 Guys or places like that.  Usually the best are at 40 year old single location little greasy spoons.  Lenny's is not a big chain so I would consider them more \"local\" than a chain.  This particular location is tiny with seating for less than 30 people.  Half the building is taken up by the kitchen and service counter.  The first time I try a burger place I always order a single, no cheese and what the restaurant considers their basic burger.  I do this so I can taste the actual meat patty rather than have it covered up by lots of condiments.  I did so at Lenny's, a single combo with fries and a drink.  To Lenny's a basic burger has lettuce, onion, tomato and pickle with a ranch dressing.  To me it was bland and mushy and the toppings completely hid any meat flavor.  It was completely opposite of my idea of what a burger should be.  The meat patty was too thin, the lettuce was too finely chopped, the red onion was sliced so thin it was stringy and the sauce did nothing to enhance the flavor.  Finally the bun was too soft.  The fries however were fantastic ... thick and tasty with a nice crisp bite to them.  To their credit, the prices at Lenny's are very reasonable and I would not give a second thought to eating there over McDonald's anytime.  The price for a combo meal is about the same.  I considered the service excellent.  The counter clerk was friendly and the meal is brought to your table.  The lady who served us was super-friendly.  I had the impression that everyone who works there enjoys their job.  Overall the place looked clean and the retro decor was pleasant.  Note that Lenny's is more geared to be a drive in than a sit-down place and the outdoor dining area is basically some tables in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Showed up at 8:30 for one of the delicious milkshakes with all my friends. Crazy bummed out this place was closed even though the signage and hours of operation show they close at 9. They should either post signage they are closing early or something. Missed out on about 12 people tonight."}
{"text":"I have driven by Lenny's a few times and had been wanting to give it a try since I had first seen it. We decided on Sunday to visit for the first time. We went through drive through after they opened around 10am. I ordered The Cowboy Burger Combo, my boyfriend ordered the Double Burger Combo, and we added on one order of onion rings. Our total came out to about $23 for our items. I thought this was a little pricey but figured for the price this was going to be some amazing food.  The customer service left much to be desired. I believe I saw a sign that said each customer can only have 4 ketchup packets per order? Well hahaha, I received 5 ketchup packets. The joke is on Lenny's!  Also, ranch is extra also. If I am paying almost $3 for onion rings I think I should at least get a side of sauce. Onto trying the actual food. The burgers were big, and the fries and onion rings were hot. The burgers were boring, no flavor at all. My boyfriend and I didn't even finish our meals which is rare for us being foodies and all. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Just ate there for dinner with family, food was okay and place was clean, not the best food but not bad also."}
{"text":"NOTE:....this would have been a 5... but Pam took 2 stars off!  This Lenny's Burger at 59th Ave and Peoria 10635 N. 59th Ave Glendale Az 85302  FOOD IS AMAZING Cowboy Burger...Pretty Great..! Pastrami Burger - Phenomenal..! #2 is a Double that is Amazing and my sons Favorite Onion rings -  perfect Beer Batter..! French Fries..(If you love fries you will love these)  They use a super fine salt (So Could use a Super Fine Pepper)   Our second experience at the location left more to be desired. It seems our order through the drive-thru, it was taken and the woman on the phone was pleasant and everything went well until the order came.  It seemed fine until we explained that we took the $0.60 upgrade on all three meals and we double checked the order and found a french fry, we brought it to their attention and it seemed like was not going to be much trouble.   BOY THAT WAS THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE NIGHT....!!  Normally I would have have jumped in the middle of the of \"PAM\" and my wife about the issue and put the cab-bash on it and keep it civil..!! That never happened and I literally sat back in my chair as Pam would \"Literally NOT STOP GETTING INCREASINGLY LOUDER\" to over talk my wife over \" S-I-X-T-Y-C-E-N-T-S\"..  So needless to say we never got the fries and in the words of the movie \"8Mile\"  All well that ends O.K. so we say \"F\" you Pam and have a nice day ...!!  So with that  Food is awesome Service is great when you don's set Pam off! By the way our Third trip through food was good and Yes Pam waited on us and it was simple and in and out.   We will roll through again... Thank God for Limo Tint"}
{"text":"Yelpers...please rate these places accurately! I wanted a burger, so i looked on yelp to see the highest rated places were. I went in and ordered a double with cheese and the works. After the 1st bite, I knew i lost 8 bucks.   This was not worthy of a 4 star. Mushrooms tasted like they got it out of a can and the burger meat wasn't appealing. I asked for medium well and it wasn't cooked correctly. When it comes to burgers, I don't joke around.   This place has nothing on 5 guys. Totally unsatisfactory.   I will try it again, to make sure I get a good reading."}
{"text":"This was worth the ride on the Metro Rail. I get the Triple Burger with Cheese. Ohh man its greasy and the meat is fresh. I love the fries i can never get enough. I never had a shake but they seem to be made with Real Ice Cream. Doesnt take to long to get your food even during the Lunch Rush. Employees are polite and funny, joking around with you and the other employees."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are so good. Cooked to perfection, and hits all the taste buds. Looking forward to coming here many times over... I had the double Mexican burger. Fantastic!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dirty dirty! We sat down to eat our lunch and the windows are filled with flys, all dead and looking like they've been there awhile.  Absolutely not something that should be seen in a restaurant. The place looks tired and run down anyway but the fly's are unacceptable."}
{"text":"Heck ya!  Great burger, good fries.  Small dive with 2 bar tops with 3 stools each.  We ate in.  Good price and great alternative to the chains when you're near (definately  more flavor for your buds).    There are a couple benches outside too."}
{"text":"Sent my burger back but the second one was still tasteless and dry, devoid of any seasoning (probably frozen) and why do you need five different burgers that differ only based on condiments?   The fries were inconsistent from lack of frier maintenance. The ice was all melted in the soda machine. The bathroom had a weird hall tree straight out of a bad cowboy movie. The furniture and flooring was seriously ghetto and the windows have so much advertising you couldn't see out, like you're in a hamburger prison."}
{"text":"food is ok but they get the order wrong all the time- they ALWAYS forget to put the fries in the bag and when you get home guess what NO FRIES (that you paid for)!! two stars for ok food no stars for always forgetting the fries (this happens all the time- not just once or twice)."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE these burgers!  When I am craving a good burger, I come here!  The ranch burger is my \"go to\" order.  Top it off with an order of their fries, and I'm set!"}
{"text":"Lenny, Lenny, Lenny. I've had your take out, love the flavors, but you kinda mess up my order. Every. Time. I wanted Thousand Island and got BBQ. I wanted a double. And got a triple. FOR THE LOVE OF BEEF...THREE PATTIES IS JUST WRONG! Julia Roberts couldn't fit that stack o beef in her mouth. And she's got a big ass mouth. Seriously. And why do I like your fries? They are reminiscent of Ore Ida. But that's cool, cuz I like 'em. And if you could slow down when slapping my toppings on those de lish sizzling patties...messy is good, but I eventually just made a salad out of that last burger. Chopped it all up and ate it with a fork. And eventually, my fingers. So Lenny. I think Squiqqy is distracting you. I know you're the Lone Wolf and all, but focus, focus focus. Who on earth will get this 80s reference wins a free drink. On me."}
{"text":"Worst place I have ever been to. Their Frys were cold and soggy the fry sauce was terrible. Their burger was disgusting the pickles & the mushrooms tasted like a soggy sweaty testicle. I want my $15 refund. I'm so appalled you even gave me food that tasted this gross. Fuck ya'll lazy ass mfs. The least you can do is makes someone's food right. Fuck ya'll dirtbags"}
{"text":"Favorite hole in the wall for burgers and fries.  Never had a bad meal there.  Perhaps a little pricey but worth it to me anyway."}
{"text":"Located in a kinda beaten up strip center on Central Avenue, I wasn't expecting much from Lenny's.  As it turned out, I was very impressed.  Their burger was great, the price was very reasonable, the portion size was very generous, and the french fries were outstanding.  The 50's diner vibe makes the place feel like more than a fast food restaurant.   Next time I am in the area, I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Lenny's today because I was craving a hamburger and have been wanting to give them a try.  I love the decor and old school diner theme.    Kept it simple and ordered the #1, which was a single burger with cheese and all the fixings, a very generous portion of french fries, and a drink for $8.47.  The food was all delicious, fries were crisp and seasoned well.  The staff was friendly and my order to go was ready in just a few minutes.    The fries weren't piping hot when I got them which means they were probably sitting for at least a short time but stayed crisp till I finished them, and were seasoned really well.  The price point on the single burger and fries combo is probably $1-$2 higher than Lucky's but all in all I'd come back and would love to try one of the speciality burgers."}
{"text":"Amazing spread of ratings for a fairly standard product. Been to every Lenny's in Glendale/Phoenix over the past decade plus. Always the same standard sole proprietor feeling, always the same good diner burger and sides especially the rings. Maybe the store on Central is a bit superior, but they're all good. If you don't like Lenny's you don't have an appreciation for the southwest diner burger. It's ok you're just looking for something else. But this place is at least a 4 star purveyor in its genre."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a hamburger always fresh & made to order. And customer service is great also everyone that works here is very friendly and quick to help as you walk in the door!"}
{"text":"Renovations look great! We missed this place. Best burgers and chicken sandwiches in town! If you appreciate tasty, not fancy, deliciousness - this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Great old school burger place it is like something out of the 50's has great malts and ice cream as well as fantastic burgers."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food burger. Lenny's grills the bun and many establishments don't and I personally like a grilled bun. Also for smaller appetites like mine they have a Lenny's Junior burger that is a perfect size for me. Milkshakes divine and many flavors. We spoke today to Connie, the manager, and she mentioned that her brother has owned this restaurant for 17 years.  Yummy??"}
{"text":"I seem to forget about Lenny's for my lunch break.  I've only been here once and I really enjoyed my cheeseburger.  It's a tiny, BUSY burger joint/diner on Central Ave.  It's quick too-- they got me in and out and happily fed in good time.  I need to pick a day soon to head over there again!"}
{"text":"You know that feeling you get watching \"Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle\"? That movie makes you hungry for a perfect burger. I am not a huge fan of White Castle, they are good, but Lenny's is better. But...when you do get to the end of that movie, Our protagonists enjoy a slo-mo burger in a montage that Caligula would find a little too indulgent.  In over 20 years the only problem I that I have ever encountered from this location, which is my favorite of all the Lenny's shops, is that I once was given the wrong burger in a take out bag.  I would have complained about it but Zia only gave us 30 minutes to eat/smoke/pull bongs etc. so I just ate the burger that Lenny's erroneously put in my bag. That burger was a Tasty with Swiss plus bacon and is now my go-to burger when crushing a mean lunch at Lenny's.  Even their mistakes outclass any other joint in Phoenix!  I am so grateful that they expanded my burger horizons, I soon after tried the Mexican burger- a miracle! It is definitely something that those hacks at the Food Network would try to do, and they might come close, but fail at meeting the magic of Lenny's flat iron grill.  The help is always friendly and busy, they work very hard to keep everything fresh. That becomes clear when your last bite is being loaded in and a culinary wistfulness shrouds over you, noting to your mental clipboard that you must find some distinguishing landmarks to remember where to go when you want burger happiness.  If there was a better seating situation I would easily give them the 5th star. Although if they made me eat these burgers on a bed of nails, I would oblige."}
{"text":"A decent burger stop with a wonderful old vibe. The service can get a little spotty at times (depending who you get on the register, they might get confused by your order or they might take too long with it), but the food comes to you on time and it's definitely good-tastin'. It's nothing special, but that's not to say it doesn't have any perks... After all, their floats are surprisingly cheap, and not bad tasting at all! I'd certainly come back here for a nice float or two with some fries on the side."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good tasting as the Lenny's on 35th ave and Tbird.    But still, better than any fast food chain burger."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers around.   You will want to be sure to get your food to go, though, due to limited space.  I've been going here for over 12 years.  Go to this one, not the others."}
{"text":"This is not McDonald's and jack n the box, they don't have mystery meat. Beef is 100% real and it's good quality, so those of you say that its overpriced need to understand that the higher quality the higher price, and they're really not that pricey so I don't mind spending 3.50 on a deluxe cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Good burger... Good fries... I feel fatter after eating here."}
{"text":"Been going there since I was 10. I love their service and nostalgia. Their food fits the craving you look for when going there. It just isn't the most amazing burger place I've been to. That's all. Check them out, get the western burger(double with Swiss and onion rings and bbq sauce)."}
{"text":"Every thing is pretty good I normally go to Detroit coney but this place is closer to where I live I like the burgers but it was my first time so the kid upsold me on jalapeño chili cheese fries but I only wanted the cause I thought they where diced jalapeños he said it was but maybe he heard sliced! But I like the place overall I'll be back."}
{"text":"Excellent burger hot right off the grill! I got a double burger with cheese and upgraded to the large fries and xl drink. I got a huge burger and more fries than I could eat and it cost less than nine bucks. Atmosphere is retro and lively."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There fry sauce is something to add to the meal when you order and I also recommend the Ruben and orange cream-sickle shake."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment in several different locations throughout Az. Needless to say it never disappoints. There malts are delicious and just the right amount of thick. There burgers are big juicy and flavorful. This time I got there appetizer of breaded mushrooms and zucchini. The mushrooms here have a unique and delicious taste to them I would recommend anything I have had here to anyone I know."}
{"text":"Ehhhh, I would think spending five bucks on a burger it would at least be something homemade and tasty... unfortunately it only tasted good cause of the bbq sauce.   Will never be back to this high priced establishment..."}
{"text":"This isn't like any other Lenny's I've been to previously!  Most of them have been very hole in the wall feeling.  The one is really cool looking, with the feeling that you've stepped into a 50's diner, or a restaurant with history instead of one in just a strip mall.  Small booths line one side, and you can sit right at the counter, but everyone orders the same - walk up to a guy and tell him what you want.  Before I'd filled up my soda can my burger and fries were hot and ready go to.  And SO good!    Great mix of folks there, cops, guys in suits, folk who live in the general area and of course all the folks who work in walking distance.  If you call ahead there is a special place where you can pick up the orders too in case you're getting it for the whole office.  I held back on getting a shake, but at other locations it's the shake that makes the visit.  They have so many flavors and they'll mix them for no additional cost.  Flavors include vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, banana, caramel, peanut butter, pineapple, cherry, cinnamon, and several others.  I spent a good 5 minutes just staring at the board and coming up with potential flavor combos.  Mmmmm....  It's not going to be the best burger in Phoenix or anything, but it's fast, it's simple, and the location itself is pretty cool.  Oh yea - they also have hot dogs and other goodies, but to me, it's all about burger, fries and a shake."}
{"text":"Lenny's seems to fit the pseudo old town style that downtown Glendale is going for. My wife an I tend to come and split a fry and malt and each get a burger. Definitely better than fast food chains. This is one of a handful of good hangouts in Glendale."}
{"text":"This place is usually a great place to get a burger but maybe they were off their game or the cook was a different person. The burger I had today was terrible, and the fries over salted, not to mention the guy handing me my burger, gave me the coldest look. Sad to say, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"R J here,  this has got to be the best burger in west Phoenix! Cooked in front of you, on a Grill not a flattop. The frys are Not sitting under a heatlamp and have just enough seasoning. Great flavor! I have eaten at other Lenny's but this one is the Best. The kitchen is TINY but there is plenty of seating next door. I drive 10 to 12 miles for these burgers. You got to give them a try!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best burger I've had! Great little dive to go to! Next time I'll be sure to try a malt, I'm literally kicking myself in the butt for not trying one. Oh well! More reason to go back! Try this place out! It's great! Great food, great customer service, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Several years ago, a couple coworkers took me out to lunch at Lenny's.  Over the years, I've been back on several occasions and have consistently had an excellent experience.  The only reason I don't go all the time is that I live quite a ways away.  Lenny's burgers remind me of summertime backyard BBQ's.   The restaurant is definitely nothing fancy, but that helps contribute to the casual feeling of eating burgers in my backyard.  All in all, the place gives off good vibes.  Outside of the burgers, the fries are good (lightly seasoned) and the shakes fit in just right.   So, whenever I need to get my fix for that chargrilled, backyard flavor, this is my go-to place.  I always leave good n' full and in a great mood!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger! Reminds me of jims burger shop on Whittier blvd & Rowan ave in ELA :)"}
{"text":"Great burgers every time. Fries are good, nothing spectacular but I'm a steak fries kinda gal. Phone orders are ready for pick-up in about 5-7 minutes! Woohoo! Service is always friendly. I really like this place."}
{"text":"Paid $10 for a nice sized double cheese burger, decent fries, and a huge fountain drink. This location is definitely leaning towards the hole in the wall/ mom and pop type of joint. The burger tasted alright."}
{"text":"Great staff! Super friendly. Sit down luncheon environment. The burger was outta this world withe right combination of stacked and messy   Bacon ranch fries were amazing. 50s/60s style. Was clean and pleasing to the eye. Great for quick but quality food. Couldn't ask for a more polite, ready to help staff!"}
{"text":"I would rate a full 5 stars but I come here at least 5 times a week to get my girls at work lunch and it always takes forever. food is great amazing burgers and the French fries are to die for, this will do meanwhile I wait for a Shake Shack burger joint to open here in AZ from new York."}
{"text":"Had a pretty terrible experience with the young man at the drive through.  I typically only comment when I have great experiences and usually Lenny's is excellent.  Stopped by for some Friday evening chili cheese fries and a shake.  My aunt actually just wanted an ice cream sundae.  First off the kid had a major attitude and kept making us repeat the order through the drive through and scowled at us as we pulled up to the window.  Secondly when my aunt asked what comes on the sundae and he said usually nuts but they were all out. Well that is unfortunate but it is what it is.  She then asked if it had whipped cream on the Sundae.  The young man said they used to but they got in trouble for putting whipped cream on the sundaes and they could only put it on the shakes??..  He passed the blame to the manager which I thought was kind of strange.  He also did not even offer to do an up charge on the whipped cream  You would think they least they could do since there was no nuts, is offer free whipped cream but we were not even asking for that.  Overall the experience left us confused and made me think I would avoid this overpriced ****hole in the future.  Clearly the young man was either having a bad day or was just really freaked out that a customer might want a sundae with the traditional ingredients.  Also a smile and a friendly attitude goes a long way when you cannot accommodate a customer."}
{"text":"Awesome joint for a Burger meal.  Great burger patty, awesome seasoned fries and big size drink! Under $7."}
{"text":"I found a fatass hair from my guy Luigi cooking up the burger. fell off his stache but its cool the burger was scrumptious. 4 stars the other star was the hair."}
{"text":"When I used to work at Central and Thomas, this was my preferred lunch location. There would be many times I'd sneak out the back doors to avoid having Melanie pick her up something (which she did every time. Quit asking me where I'm going. I'm not your mule.)  I had the good fortune to be back at that branch and Lenny's was calling my name. They've expanded since my former days going there, but it was just as busy and the food remained awesome. The green chili burger is my standard order, and really brought back memories. Well, fond memories of their food, not of Melanie. :shudders:"}
{"text":"I work down the street and my first time eating here Lenny the owner was actually my cashier and accidentally gave me chilli cheese fries instead of a chilli dog. I let him know and he apologized and gave me the chilli dog on the house. This place not only has amazing food, but the owner is extremely humble and kind. Definitely will be back plenty of times!"}
{"text":"I had the cowboy burger and it was AMAZING, and with an unbeatable price! The meat was also perfectly seasoned, so I probably would have been happy with just the simple hamburger. :D  Since I was in Phoenix for a conference and hadn't eaten vegetables for a couple of days, I decided to get the \"fresh garden salad\". Don't do it! It's basically pre-packaged shredded lettuce with a few slices of cucumbers and tomatoes. Could have spent those four bucks on another burger. );  The decor was super cute, and they were playing old songs like For the Longest Time and Take On Me!"}
{"text":"I approached this unknown plaza and approached the small \"trailer\" that is Lenny Burger. I ordered a single cheese burger meal, double cheeseburger meal and a chili cheese dog. The chili cheese dogs was yummy but I'm not a fan of chili with beans on my hit dog. Many of the pictures on Yelp! Show a burger with seaseme seeds with my burger was served on a plain bun. The burger was good but I felt that it lacked seasoning. The fries were good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning on them. Overall a decent meal, but don't know how often I would eat here."}
{"text":"Lenny's is one of my burger favorites. They always have a nice juicy burger fixed the way you want. This Lenny's is decorated with old signs and the seating is, well lets say tight. I think there is 5 booths and a long narrow table in the center. They have many choices other than burgers and everything I or the people with me have gotten has been very good. I have been to several other Lenny's. Lenny's menu may change from one store to the next but all I have eaten at has been good."}
{"text":"The Burgers are Amazing! The Chicken Sandwich is pretty good!   I recommend that you stop in and if you want something really SouthWest Style, get the Mexican burger!  You can thank me later!   Excellent Service!!!"}
{"text":"First time visitor, and I was not pleasantly surprised, in fact I was fairly disappointed. I watched my burger patty get pulled out of a bin of sorts, which I assume was filled with beef stock, and then basically reheated on the grill. My burger was actually less satisfying than the same style of burger would have been from Burger King.   I'm also not a fan of the fries.  Plenty of other burger joints that cost about the same around here that have much better food.   Maybe it was an off day, I don't know, but what I do know is that I will not be coming back. Why would I pay nearly $8 for a burger combo meal that wasn't even as good as Burger King.   Voted best burger in 2010? It must have been a rough five years. I'm sorry Lenny, but I have much higher expectations.   I literally just got off a 6 hour shift on the line at the restaurant I work at, and I can appreciate a greasy burger as much as the next guy but come on."}
{"text":"Cute little fifties type diner with a drive through. Service was fast and food was great!"}
{"text":"still damn good burger. messy and delicious. fries are pretty good too. tried the strawberry malt and it was tasty. otherwise not much else i can add from my previous review.   Yum.!!.."}
