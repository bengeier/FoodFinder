{"text":"BEST MEXICAN IN TOWN!!!!!  Been coming here for years, fresh chips and salsa.  Tacos are fabulous,  but everything is good."}
{"text":"I am so glad a friend kept bugging me about needing to try La Mestiza. \"It's so close to where you live,\" she said, \"and they have great margaritas.\" Well, now that I have tasted La Mestiza, it might become a problem for me. It is so good!  First of all, the place is so cute. Tissue paper banners across the ceiling. Art from local artists on the walls. And the servers are wonderful! Attentive, but not in-your-face, friendly, and informative.  The food is delicious. It feels way more authentic than a lot of Mexican restaurants in the are: not over seasoned and made with fresh ingredients. The Chicken Enchiladas Rojas were so delicious, and a nice portion size. Enough I feel satisfied, but not stuffed. I also got to sample some of the pumpkin seed sauce. Yum!  Nice, strong, simple margaritas... Not made from a mix!  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"In the upper midwest, when soemone says \"mexican food\" the immediate thought is usually of some varaitey of tex-mex, or god help us something vaguely resembling outsized taco bell entrees.  And that stuff has its place - it's great comfort food and who can't say they've had a post-bar-time craving for a big plate of unnaturally orange nachos?  This is not one of those places.  Mexican food is diverse and varied, and La Mestiza chooses to focus on the home-style foods of Oaxaca.  While they have a selection of tacos, tortas, and tamales, they also feature a lot of slow-cooked braised meats, and really that's where the action is.  Stewed lamb, slow-cooked pork, carnitas, in sauces of pasilla chiles or a dark mole poblano - this is the real deal.  They even do a respectable ceviche, something one usually doesn't expect to find in a strip mall.  Unfortunately the rice and beans as a ubiquitous side dish are pedestrian.  I've had worse, but I've also had better.    The opening salvo of fresh tortilla chips with salsas is quite nice.  It's something every mexican restaurant does, but the chips here are usually hot and just slightly greasy from their recent frying, and the salsas are different from the tomato-and-cilantro affairs that grace most tables.  A somewhat hot, smoky, slightly bitter red chile sauce on one side, and a soft, vegetal green sauce on the other.  You can order guacamole, but it's best to skip it - it's nothing particularly memorable and, while traditional, lacks much flavor beyond avocado.    They're licensed to sell drinks, and make a mean margarita.    They are, on the face of it, more expensive than your standard taqueria or tex-mex establishment, although it's slightly deceptive.  Portions are large for dinner, and lunch hours are graced with very reasonably-priced lunch specials that are generally slightly smaller versions of their flagship dishes."}
{"text":"If you are tired of the usual Mexican place with burritos, tacos and enchiladas with the same old variations and drinks that are half sour mix, this is the place for you.  Really good food.  We have been here 4-5 times and always had something different and always loved it.  I have to say the service has been a little iffy at times, but the food made up for it. Some people seem to think it is pricey.  You are not getting ground beef on a tortilla... it will be a little a little more expensive."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant. They have a lunch special I went to with my daughter Simone. The bill was about $16 and the food was outstanding. Everything across-the-board including their salsa, entrées, dessert were outstanding. They had beautiful decor and art on the walls. This was real Mexican not Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Perfect place for brunch with friends on a Sunday... friendly service, good margaritas, and a wide selection of food. I had the trio of tacos and flautas. They were solid dishes. Friends had vegetarian enchiladas, carnitas, and the table favorite - Enchiladas de Pollo con Mole. Reasonable prices and a great location... happy to see thm expanding to downtown."}
{"text":"I didn't have very high expectations for this place because it did not look very special from the outside, but the food was fabulous! The housemade chips were wonderful."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Madison area. Everything we ordered was so wonderful and flavorful.  The appetizer Quesadillas de Rajas y Queso were real eye openers and delicious, unlike anything I'd had before. My stuffed pepper was so full of flavor and nicely presented. My wife's carne asada was  tender and spiced perfectly. The dessert, platanos con cajetas, made our eyes roll back in our heads: exotic and like a revelation. Our waitress knew the menu so well and was eager to tell us all about each item we were interested in.  The staff are welcoming and the ambiance is cheery. Try it!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food in a humble setting.  The carrots preserved in vinegar are magnificent.  This is a hard-working kitchen that consistently serves tasty fare.  I can recommend this restaurant with confidence."}
{"text":"I attempted to eat here tonight for the first time. I only ate a couple bites of my dinner. After ordering and looking around deeper, I saw half bottles of alcohol stored on the floor on a moldy tile covered wood shelf that was molding.  Then when my Mail came, it tasted like the cheese or something was spoiled. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Over the past few years I have been to La Mestiza three or four times.  In the past I thought the food was decent and the service was good (I would have given in 3 or maybe even 4 stars on previous visits), and I liked that it was locally owned/operated and seemed to be trying for authenticity.  However, on my last visit things seemed to have really gone downhill.  At my last visit to La Mestiza, my companion and I experienced cold tasteless food that was probably among the worst Mexican food we've had anywhere.  The dining room was also freezing and we had to wear our coats inside.   Besides the food, the worst part was the horrible service from our waiter who forgot our orders, never checked back, never refilled drinks, took ages to bring the bill, etc.  And then to top off a bad experience, we found out that the waiter will steal from you!  I almost hate to recount this, because as I indicated, I did have decent experiences with La Mestiza during previous visits.    A few days after our visit, I noticed that the bill appearing on my charge card was for a different amount than I had authorized.   I phoned and eventually got the manager, who said he would check into it.  He discovered that on my credit card slip the waiter had crossed out my tip and wrote in a bigger tip, apparently thinking that I would not notice!!!  The manager refunded me the extra few dollars and was nice about it.  While he didn't come out and say it, my impression was that this was not the first time this had occurred.  I will give him credit that he took care of the refund promptly and did apologize.  However, staff stealing from customers is unacceptable!  I really hope that this experience was not the norm, as I know many people like this place, just as I used to.  I just hope they all pay cash or check their credit card charges after."}
{"text":"The pollo trio de tacos is my all-time favorite taco. I wish I knew how this miracle was created. It tastes like the chicken is stewed in some magical blend of spices. Throw a little cilantro and onion on that over a corn tortilla, and i'm yours.  This is a lovely place, and everything i've had there has been delicious. i can never stay away for too long."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both times it was great. The price wasn't bad and the service was excellent. To see it from the outside, you might have doubts but don't let that stop you. A very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Good food, not your typical menu, one of the better restaurants in the area for Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"I ate at both locations and really liked it for diner and breakfast on the weekend.  Salsa and chips were good and fresh.  Roast pork dish was spot-on. Only complaint is that mole needs a bit more zip.  Look forward to returning next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This hidden gem in a strip mall serves a great meal. The waiters are a little too hipster for my tastes, but the service was great. The food was very good.  My Rojas sauce was interesting, sweeter than I expected.  We had great margaritas. Overall a good experience and I'd go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! We've been here many times and have never been disappointed. The service is always spot on and the food is always scrumptious. The tortilla chips and salsas are to die for. Easily the best Mexican food in Madison!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service. There was only one waiter and he clearly could not manage more than 3 parties at once. He was unable to explain the size difference between an appetizer and entree (later I found out it was because the entrees were smaller portions). I was served a glass with lipstick on it, clearly indicating that my glass was not cleaned. The chips were ok. To top it off, the waiter automatically added the tip into the bill and I had to ask for a receipt where I could adjust the tip. Overall, I would not recommend this restaurant due to poor service, price, portion size, and dishonest billing practices."}
{"text":"Restaurant/Decor: 4/5 - a bit cramped, but cozy and definitely a feel of Mexico or a cantina.  Menu: 3/5 - limited menu. No fajitas listed and there are more appetizers than entrees.   Drinks: 5/5 - Margaritas are fantastic and made from lime juice, not a cocktail blend. They are also strong, so beware.  Food/Taste: 5/5 - food, although limited on the menu, is excellent. Good flavors and presentation.  Chips/Salsa: 3/5 - this would be a 5/5 but for the salsa. It tastes like something from Roundys and doesn't have much flavor. The verde salsa is pretty good though and the chips keep this rating from being a 1/5. Chips are amazing and fresh made I think.  Overall this place is quite nice. Food is great, drinks are amazing and strong and service is quick and friendly. The chips and salsa and limited menu are the only downsides.   Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I really liked the food but don't expect to see a burrito or chimichanga on the menu. It was also a little pricier than I'm used to for mexican but I still enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I thought the food was terrible. The enchilada sauce tastes like bbq sauce. They said they didn't have queso dip. The margarita was subpar. I took 1 bite of my food and couldn't eat the rest. Taco bell tastes more authenic than this place. I lived in Houston, TX for 2 years maybe that's why I'm so lucky about good Mexican food, but this place definitely doesn't have it. Never again will I waste my money there"}
{"text":"This place was enjoyable. I ordered the borego (lamb) my wife had the carnitas. It was tasty and I would recommend it the place as one of the better mexican places in town! Then grab desert nearby at the michoacana."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and the service was great.  I had the trio tacos which gives you a variety of meats and flavors."}
{"text":"Best Mexican we have had in Madison.  Love the salsa they make.  Great place to go before seeing a movie.  Service is great and they have some good deals during the week.  Never had a bad experience there."}
{"text":"Ummmmm. Margaritas made with real lime juice. Delicious vegetarian sides. Cozy ambiance. Handmade fried tortilla chips. Traditional Banda music. Outstanding service. Reasonable prices.  I wish they would open an actual restaurant instead of this rink a dink place in a West Towne strip mall! So far the best Mexican food we have had since moving to Madison. And I lived in Xalapa, MX for awhile so there is my credibility statement.   Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"The food was great as always. The house made tortilla chips were hot and light as air. Love the cochinitas and the lamb.  The complexity of flavor is outstanding. The simply described cebollitas were a pleasant surprise. I had never ordered them before, but I will always get them in the future. Madison is lucky to have a Mexican restaurant like La Mestiza."}
{"text":"I tell you, I've been to so many Mexican Restaurants and La Mestiza tops them all. That is ALL I can say!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, drinks were just okay.  I had the pork carnitas special. It is kind of funny seeing a staple of mexican cooking as a \"special\" only, but I'll make the positive assumption that they freshly roast enough piggy for a night, and are hence limited. It was quite tasty, and so was their salsa and guacamole (although the guac appetizer was kind so pricey). My biggest disappointment was in the happy hour margarita, it was vey much watered down. If I was there sooner than 3 minutes before happy hour ended, and could of put away a lot more I might have not minded.  The decor is totally \"hole in the wall\", a la \"cheap Chinese takeout\" restaurant too.  The food is what matters, and I'd go again."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, friendly service, tasty drinks and excellent mexican beer selection. Never crowded hopefully business picks up soon because it would be sad to see such a great place close."}
{"text":"I'll admit I was a little shocked by the price of La Mestiza. At least where I'm from, it's incredibly unlikely to wander into a Mexican Restaurant in a strip mall and end up paying 14$ a plate.  That said, the food was good. Very good, even. My only complaint is that there are only two things on the vegetarian menu, one of which were fajitas, which I'm not crazy about... which doesn't give me any options.  The drinks were dynamite, super tasty and well balanced, and our server was friendly and professional.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"As good as it gets for Mexican cuisine in Madison.  I say cuisine for a reason.  This is not chain Mexican or a taco joint.  Nothing terribly fancy just nice preparations in a small family friendly restaurant.  Great margarita's too."}
{"text":"Every weekend they feature a Carnitas special.  It is consistently wonderful- flavorful, large portions and beautiful presentation. With Mexican coffee and flan for dessert it is an awesome meal. Great service too. I love the house made chips, salsa and fresh made guacamole."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favorite places in Madison. it is worth driving out the the understated location in the strip mall on Odana Road, where food and service are better than the downtown location. The ingredients are all fresh and the dishes authentic. Try the vegetarian enchilada with pumpkin sauce-- a winner even for carnivores. My favorite is the shrimp in the garlic bath. The tortilla chips are the best in town and although I am not a fan of the red salsa, the green salsa is amazing. Also worth a try and the grilled green onions, prepared simply and just delicious."}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon a few weeks ago. I'm still thinking about how good the food was!  I'm from the South, and had just assumed Mexican food isn't as good here in the Midwest.   Was I wrong! Best Mexican food in the area by a landslide, fantastic margaritas (no bottom shelf liquor), and in-house-made tortilla chips. Service was very good--the waiter was incredibly knowledgeable.   GO!"}
{"text":"My favorite part of this meal was the warm (flash fried?) tortilla chips with guacamole. Please order the guacamole to start off!! The salsa was also pretty tasty.  Now to the tacos, I ordered my usual chicken, beef, pork, and they were decent. Tacos are served on lightly toasted corn tortillas with a spoonful of onion and cilantro tossed on - just how I like my tacos. None of the flavors in the tacos were that memorable and I ended up adding more hot sauce to spruce them up. Hot sauce isn't on the table, but they'll bring it out if asked.   Isaac ordered the carnitas special, which had a bit more fatty sections than either one of us preferred.  Atmosphere - small, cozy and clean.  Service - quick and friendly, even with most of the tables filled. Cost - cheap  Overall - I'd eat here again, but maybe try one of their specialties instead of the tacos."}
{"text":"We were recently at the downtown location on a Saturday night. I couldn't believe the place was almost empty. My friend and I shared a appetizer which had quesadilla's and flauta's as well as a few other things. Delicious. Plus the strawberry margarita's were fantastic.  We sat at the bar and while the service was good, my friend and I felt the bartender was a bit pushy/arrogant/creepy. It's the only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars. But, I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've ever had - really. Try the Borrego en Chile Pasilla (lamb in a heavy pungent sauce with a kick) or the Cochinita Pibil (pork marinated in citrus with pickled onions - complex and layered).the rice and beans don't overwhelm the entrees. Atmosphere is typical Mexican colors of red and orange, but the original artwork sets it apart. I'll be here again within a week."}
{"text":"This place ranks 5 stars in relation to the state of Mexican cuisine in Madison.  This is authentic Mexican as opposed to the usual tex-mex that everyone other place in the downtown vicinity offers and it makes for a wonderful addition to the downtown food scene.  I had the carnitas, which were one of the special offerings of the night, and while I'm not used to having carnitas shredded they were cooked perfectly and everyone at my table loved them.  It's the type of spot that deserves to be frequented and as busy as it got in there I don't think they'll be a long-lasting establishment."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken enchilada with Mole sauce. It was exquisite!! The restaurant is very cozy and charming. The service is very efficient too. This is my second time here, and I will keep coming back every time I visit Madison."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican food in Madison.  Tamales are great!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in madison.   Its the only place i've found that serves cactus!  It's also got the best mole, and salsa verde. Whenever we go, what ever we order, the food is consistently high quality.  La Mestiza is actually the best Mexican food I've had outside of California.   Sometimes the service is just a little slow, but the staff are always very friendly."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  I had a margarita lujo with fresh lime juice (very good).  The fresh chips and two salsas they bring to the table were awesome.  I had the appetizer platter as my dinner since I was short on time.  All very good.  Small place, nice ambience, super nice wait staff, fast service.  I am coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Best Mexican we have had on quite some time! The fish special is now one of my favorite meals. Don't let the strip mall location fool you; the food is phenomenal and I will definitely come back when we are in Madison again."}
{"text":"Good chips.   Decent happy hour adult beverages.   Somewhat confusing happy hour entrees. Every time I go to happy hour someone disputes their bill as they failed to read the fine print on the poster leading into the restaurant.   It would help customer relations to give everyone a happy hour menu that explains the taco trio is happy hour eligible when steak is not selected as a meat.   Customer service is good, entrees are a bit more expensive than you may assume, but the quality of the entrees reflects the price."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon to try this place out, and it was a huge mistake. I showed it to our server up front, and our total bill came to about $40. When I paid, I handed over my credit card and the Groupon. The server went in the back to talk to his manager, and then came back to our table. He told us that the manager would not accept the Groupon, and that he had charged the full amount to my card. When I asked to speak with the manager, our server's response was \"he won't come out, he's too angry to talk with you\". What?  The food was decent, but we left feeling angry and disrespected. Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I spent many years growing up in \"the hood\" near Chicago. I had more access to Mexican food than any other cuisine. My high school was 90% Hispanic. This means one thing...I know Mexican food not like a white girl should.   Anyhow, arrived here on a Saturday afternoon with five people in our group. The food is pricy for what you get. I thought with paying the prices we did, the servings would be much more heaping. They were a disappointment. I'm sorry but $9 for a ONE stuffed pepper and some rice is no bueno. If you want larger servings, order off the regular menu and pay $14 a plate. No thanks! I had a michalada. It was too spicy, overkill on the amount of hot. Customers normally spice their own. The chicken floutas were mediocre at best. This place has nice, contemporary art and their plates are fancy. The food is not that fabulous to warrant the prices. I'll pay good money for good food. But big money for mediocre food on fancy plates is lame. I would rather go to a taqueria that can bang out authentic Mexican food for half the price."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican!  Love it!   Margarita was great and the food was tasty and authentic.   Will return."}
{"text":"I hate to say that I was utterly disappointed with La Mestiza. I had been wanting to try this for a long time, and had high expectation from looking at the menu so many times.  I ordered the sangria and I love sangria but this was just boring. Hardly any fruit in it and it came in a very small wine glass and was way too expensive.  The chips were stale and that was VERY disappointing because we were all starving.  The menu items looked so yummy and tasty, but everything was boring. I got the tamale and it was just a chunk of meat basically.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food. We tried Enchiladas Verdes with vegetarian and chicken - both were tasty. We loved the sauce."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend. Cute, quaint little place. There were only two other tables dining, so it was not overly busy. However, it took a little bit of time for someone to come over to us ... But our server was nice, and we were not in any rush so we did not mind.   Their menu is small; I hate when a place has  pages upon pages - it's too overwhelming. I went with the vegetarian enchiladas rojas with a Pacifico. (They have Pacifico and Modelo Negro on tap, for those who are curious). I saw they had Horchata on the menu as well, so I also ordered a glass of that. I was a little disappointed by the flavor of the Horchata; it wasn't very sweet and needed more cinnamon :(   The food came out fast. It was hot and seemed to be fresh. Perfect sized lunch portion, too. You get a small basket of tortilla chips and salsa (I noticed on the menu that if you want an additional basket of chips or more salsa, there is a small charge).  But for my friend and I, this was the perfect size!  Overall, it was pretty good. Fair prices (for lunch, dinner entrees are a little more pricey), and our server was friendly. I enjoyed the relaxed and quiet atmosphere. It's nice to go out to dinner and not have to scream over the loud music or chatter of 100 other diners.  I would like to come back and try a few more things on the menu, maybe go for a mojito or margarita next time, too :)"}
{"text":"best & most authentic mexican food we've had in Madison. love the tamales, the tacos, the enchiladas, the chips and the salsa. guacamole is pretty tasty too. good margaritas and generally pleasant service. we've been back several times and introduced friends to it as well."}
{"text":"For what it is, it is very good.   I got the lamb shoulder, my wife got the carne asada. We started with chips and salsa and guacamole.  The chips were out of the world-- very good. The green salsa was very good, not spicy but very flavorful. The red salsa just wasn't doing it for me. I tried it two or three times and just couldn't get into the flavor at all. The guacamole was quite good-- smoothe, creamy, delicious.   The margaritas are phenomenal, definitely worth ordering. They are served on the rocks, in case you like them frozen.   The lamb shoulder was incredible. It was served with rice and beans, which were fairly generic on their own. The lamb made up for it though. It was covered in a delicious, slightly spicy sauce with a touch of sweetness.   The carne asada was pretty good. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but it was pretty good. Could have easily been better, I think. It was served with two tortillas, which really didn't seem like enough for an entire steak, plus roasted onions (yum) and more guac (still yum).   We got the tres leches and coffee for dessert, which we split four ways because we aren't quite that gluttonous. It was quite good, one of the highlights.   Next time I go, I plan on trying something with mole or the tres tacos appetizer (not sure why a meal is listed as an appetizer...)  I definitely recommend this place. Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but definitely better than most Mexican places."}
{"text":"Food was OK but the waiter was a dick. I ordered the carnitas, to which he replied, \"oh, the carrrrrrrnitas?\" Yeah sorry douchebag I can't roll my R's. Is there a menu item called carnita that doesn't have a rolled R? If not then don't be a pretentious dick about it."}
{"text":"Madison is lucky to have multiple very good Mexican restaurants. So sometimes it is the little things that differentiate them. After receiving my drink tonight I took one sip and then I accidentally spilled it all. Completely my fault. But a very good restaurant would have felt bad and replaced it free of charge. But after providing me a new drink, I noticed after the meal that both drinks were on the bill. Completely within their right, but the lack of a good will gesture will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Not as good as it gets in Madison, as Jeff says, but as good as it gets anywhere.  I am a long time fan of Rck Bailess and his Frontera Grill in Chicago.  He has many imitators.  This little storefront place is every bit as good at 1/2 the price and none of the attitude.  I've been to many, many excellent Mexican restaurants all over the country and this is the only one I've found where I could say that.  I often eat vegetarain and they have some great selections to choose from.  Try the vegetarian enchiladas.  Or if you're not a vegetarian-the lamb chops, the chicken in pineapple (I forget what they call in); the shrimp cocktail or the carnitas.  Excellent margaritas."}
{"text":"Flavors are unique and wonderful. The Cochinita Pibil is a must!  Their dishes take classic Latin dishest, but give a whole new twist (like pickled onions).   Prices and choices are not very kid friendly. But if you are looking for a new twist on \"mexican\" I highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon so I tried this place for lunch with a couple of friends. The menu was limited, the service was slow, the soda was flat, and the food was not to my liking at all. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.  The only saving grace was that the food was clearly fresh.  If you are looking for good, fast and inexpensive Mexican food, go to Laredo's down the street."}
{"text":"Second time at this location. First time I was blown away. Amazing service, fresh food, good food.  Second time food was just as good, service was just as good, but at the end of the night my fiancée and I noticed a 18% gratuity had been already added to our bill. There were only two of us, we weren't demanding, there were no signs posted informing us of this possibility, and to top it all off they still gave us the receipt to add a tip that did not mention tip was already included on that receipt.   Removing all customers' discretion to decide what to tip and how much is completely insulting, and the lack of signs, and the receipt to add a tip has made me very distrustful of this location. I love the food and service but this has us seriously wondering if we will be back."}
{"text":"Why doesn't this place have more stars?? Authentic, lovely high-end Mexican food on the west side, and HEAVEN for this vegan. Last Friday went in with (omnivore) friends, and I decided to order, oh, ALL of the veggie sides, and some tortillas to shovel them up. Pickled veggies, fried plantains, grilled green onions, black beans, roasted veggies, nopales (cactus), guacamole.... the cocktails are second to none and taste fresh, not like a mix. Perfect margarita. Lastly, the staff is always helpful and friendly - and I'm not sure if he was the manager or owner - but he checked on us twice and really seemed to care about our experience. If you are vegetarian or vegan, go and order these beautiful sides and feast!"}
{"text":"I have now visited La Mestiza twice, and I can't say enough good things about this place. We've struggled to find good Mexican food in Madison. La Mestiza will not satisfy your need for a giant burrito or tacos - it's not the traditional Mexican restaurant you find in America with combination plates. La Mestiza serves a relatively small menu composed of dishes highlighting the traditional regional cuisines of Mexico.   The dishes are a little bit pricey, but you get everything you expect in a pricey meal. The presentation is gorgeous, and the food is fresh and delicious. I personally recommend the enchiladas pollo con mole - their traditonal Oaxacan mole sauce is phenomenal, with all the subtle nuttiness and rich chocolate flavors I pray for when I order mole. We've ordered specials as well as the carne asada, and they all elicited \"ooo\"s and \"aahhh\"s. They have an excellent house margarita and a couple of Mexican draft beers.  The restaurant is very small, but cozy and pleasant. This is a casual restaurant that attracts a wide variety of people. The decor is inviting and comfortable, with interesting artwork hanging on the walls and paper cut-outs strung from the ceiling in a playful, un-tacky sort of way. Do come here to eat at a table - the bar only has a couple of chairs and seems to be intended only for people who are waiting for their take-out orders.  Finally, the service is excellent. I've had two different servers (who were both there both times I've visited), and they offer the knowledgeable, understated, and appropriately attentive service I would expect from a fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"The guacamole was good, my husband loved his quesadilla.  I don't remember what I ate, I would have to say that the guacamole must have made me forget :)"}
{"text":"Conchita pubil  Worth its weight in gold. Service top shelf.  Knows food, drink.  Step above most Mex. Two hour drive is worth it.  Small price to pay.                                    Tops."}
{"text":"La Mestiza is an interesting restaurant that is more upper-end Mexico city cooking. My parents are from the pueblitos in northern Mexico - so this is fancy stuff for us commoners. ;) Anyways, the food here is OKAY. Not great, but not bad. The only thing that was flat-out bad was the tortillas soup - yuck!  Their cafe de olla is awesome and other-wordly! I wish I could go there just to have that - but I feel awkward doing so. Maybe there should be a coffee house in town that serves cafe de olla? It is a pain in the butt to make oneself, and Mexican people really only drink it during Christmas (along with champurrado)."}
{"text":"Went early on a Friday evening. We were the first ones in for dinner and by the time our food came the restaurant was full.   We had the shrimp ceviche and Flautas as starters. Both were amazing. It's not often that I'm struck by a unique flavor but both had a rare distinct taste.   Between the four people in our party we had carne de sada, Camarones Enchilados (jumbo shrimp), pork and lamb chops. The meats were super tender and juicy. The shrimp were the largest I've seen in a restaurant and coated with a SPICEY orange sauce. I love spicy food and this sauce had a kick. The meal was served with fresh flour tortillas; something I've never seen in the midwest.  The only weakness in the food were the chips (little greasy). But this in no way detracts from the awesomeness of the entrees.   BEST MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN MADISON. HANDS DOWN!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are done a little different and in my opinion better than most Mexican restaurants. Chips are legit fried tortillas that are made on location. Two choices for salsa. Food is excellent"}
{"text":"Had a groupon deal to go here - it was very good and authentic although I 'm not sure if I would go if it weren't for the deal."}
{"text":"I remember going here a long time ago and I don't recall being much of a fan. I cannot recall what it was I ordered but I went back on a whim and was GREATLY impressed. The Chile Rellenos are my NEW favorite in Madison which is saying something since there was only ONE other restaurant that was doing them well(Sol Azteca on Park). The price is fairly high to me in terms of Mexican restaurants and it adds up being about $40 for 2 people for dinner but honestly - it is really worth it at that price for such a true gem in cuisine as that Chile Relleno. I'm unsure as to the rest of the menu but I'd highly recommend this if you are a fan at all!"}
{"text":"I'll have to say I was pleasantly surprised by La Mestiza. After moving to Madison in March (2012) from Chicago I lamented ever finding good Mexican food in town. I went to La Mestiza twice and have to say the food is pretty good. Let it be known I am judging Mexican food against places in the Pilsen and Logan Square neighborhoods of Chicago as well as locales in Southern California, so I have fairly high standards. 3 stars is a good showing, a against all of Madison this is the best I've had so far.  On visit #1 I had mole enchiladas, and they were a solid presentation wit a good portion. The mole was of good quality even if a touch under-spiced, but opinions vary on that topic. The chicken in those enchiladas, however, was the best. It was tender, white and juicy; not dry as in every other enchilada I've had. Rice was ok but the vegetarian black beans were excellent with very balanced flavors. I recommend those highly.  On visit #2, I had lunch. This time I wanted to get a taste of their various meats so I went with a trio of tacos -- one al Pastor, one chicken, and one carne asada. The chicken was good and the carne asada better than most, but I found the al pastor lacking with too much sweetness. All tacos were proper tacos with doubled-up corn tortillas, diced onion and chopped cilantro. The refried beans and the rice were average, but that's not a negative. They're fine, just nothing special.  Despite the strip mall location, La Mestiza has been able to make you feel as if you're not in a strip mall. I feel they're done they best they can on that front and applaud them for it.   Service was pleasant and attentive, but both times items I had ordered were forgotten and I had to ask. My opinion is the waitstaff is pressed due to a groupon deal, so I won't fault them too much for it. Again, they were super nice both times, just a little forgetful. Seeing a table of 12 walk in will do that, I suppose. Prices were fair but nothing to write home about. I did not have and drinks, but the selection of Mexican beers looked good. I would get Pacifico if I were you.  I would give 3.5 stars if I could. I will still be back and hope they iron out the kinks sometime soon."}
{"text":"I have never been to a mexican place that did not have queso cheese, burittos ,and chimichangas. But flavor wise amazing just semi small plate with no rice and beans"}
{"text":"Yet another establishment overrated on Yelp.   When we arrived we saw no one for the first 10 minutes. The very small dining room was moderately full but no staff to be found. Ten minutes after arriving a young lady (clearly busy) tossed two menus on the table without saying a word. 10-15min later we ordered. Menu is lacking many choices. I ordered the carne asana tacos (my favorite Mexican classic). The meat was tender but there was a lot of grissle and little flavor. Chips and salsa were good. My daughter ordered chicken enchiladas mole. And basically ate the chicken out of the tortillas and nothing else but the rice. She is Mexican and knows what it should taste like and she wouldn't eat it. I had a glass of sangria which was good. But overall this was not a good experience. It's a little hole in the wall but lacks menu choices and the service and food are both mediocre. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Although it is simple and in a strip mall, la mestiza prepares great, moderately priced traditional food that is closer to Rick bayless than tex mex.  both the green and brown mole are great.  I am enjoying enchiladas in a bean sauce as a special as I write this.  Bar minimal but the make a fine marg, too."}
{"text":"I have been here about four times for lunch over the last two years and each time it has been consistently good. I am not a Mexican food aficionado but it definitely seems different than the usual Tex-Mex a la Laredos.    On my last visit two weeks ago, I had the 7.95 grilled steak lunch special.  Rice and beans accompanied a nice grilled piece of flank steak covered with a deep dark mole sauce hinting of chocolate. Subtle + simple = sophisticated.  Nice. Tasty and fresh guacamole too and homemade tortilla chips!  It is not a large restaurant and some would say it is a little cramped. I call it cozy and serene."}
{"text":"First visit tonight and we loved it! I got the taco trio and husband got the special which was pork enchiladas with rose sauce. Amazing fresh and delicious food. We will be back, and probably very soon!"}
{"text":"The vegetarian options here are great. Try the enchiladas vegetarianos and wash it down with some horchata."}
{"text":"Outstanding, authentic, creative Mexican food. Those looking to go beyond burritos and explore Mexico's rich culinary traditions should pay La Mestiza a visit."}
{"text":"We've dined at La mestiza numerous times and it just seems to get better! We don't live close, about an hour and a half away but whenever we are in the area we make a point to stop to enjoy a meal there, as we did today.  Today's great meal was carnitas, the lunch special. Delicious fresh corn tortillas, refried beans, REALLY good guacamole and rice all included. What a tasty treat in a sufficient amount for supper for only $7.95!  In addition, I agree with the others: some of the best chips in the entire southeast Wisconsin area and outstanding salsa.  Our server Jose was outstanding and very attentive. We enjoyed his service very much.  Our only disappointment was that they were all out of tres leches cake. Next time, hopefully!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison I'm pretty sure.  I love it.  Homemade tortilla chips.  Wonderful pork, wonderful tacos.  I've been there twice and I'll go again soon."}
{"text":"First time going here and the waiter was rude. We came in about 40 mins before they were closing.  Ordered a few appetizers.  And as we got our bill. He put it together without asking if it was together or separate.  I asked him to redue it so we can pay seperate. And while we walked out getting into our car he stopped me and asked why he got such a shabby tip. I was in such shock. So I asked him was what we tip not enough. He then stated that since I separated my bill I had to tip him as well. Even though we gave him a decent 10 percent tip on my friends card and I paid mine in cash with an extra 60 cents left on my bill so I told my friend to put the tip on her card. And when we asked who was the store manager he said he was. Again in shock I told him I run a business and never would I have lowered myself to stop a client getting into her car about a tip he think he should have gotten.  That was rude and not something a worker should do to a customer especially now knowing he claimed he was a manager. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"So good! We started with the guacamole which was so flavorful and awesome. I had the lamb shoulder which was one of the best Mexican dishes I have ever had. The lamb was so tender and melted in your mouth. The sauces, including the house hot sauce, were so rich and wonderful. My husband had the carne asada which was perfectly cooked and amazing. The waitstaff was attentive, had great recommendations and was always available for what we needed (and this guy was brand new!). I will be back!!"}
{"text":"We had La Mestiza cater our cocktail hour. They were prompt, professional and the food was delicious! Exactly what we were looking for. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food at LaMestiza was simply DELICIOUS. The chips and salsa were GREAT just to start. The appetizers are big enough to be an entree. The menu is unique and my dish, the chicken enchiladas mole verdes with pumpkins seeds was delicious. The Trey leches cake was exquisite! Don't be fooled by the exterior. It is in a small strip mall but when you walk in there are booths and a lovely quiet ambiance. The service was excellent. Our waiter was helpful and friendly! He knew the menu well. I highly recommend La Mestiza!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for almost a year before I finally decided to try it out. Glad I finally did because it is AWESOME. Its definitely a hidden gem. The starter of homemade chips and salsa is friggen delicious! I felt like I was in Mexico. Very friendly staff. The guac.....YUM. This is my new favorite!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, more authentic than most in town, kid friendly."}
{"text":"First time here and already it's by far much better than some of the other places I've been to here in Madison.  Instantly greeted, we sat and were served drinks quickly.  The red salsa has a great smoky flavor and kick to it.  Ordered the fish tacos and were really impressed!  No fried undistinguishable fish here...just flavorfuly steamed fish with fresh toppings.  I should mention I moved here from Chicago about 1.5yrs ago and have been sorely disappointed in the Mexican places here, will certainly be back to try the other items on the menu.  The other reviews about the service need to relax, the food is good!"}
{"text":"You haven't eaten here yet? Seriously? Why not?  I'm trying to save my five stars for truly supernatural experiences but La Mestiza comes close. I may even upgrade after another visit.  This is some of the most delicious Mexican food I've ever had. Fresh ingredients, well seasoned with everything cooked to just the perfect consistency and texture. Featuring some less common menu items, beyond your enchiladas and your fajitas: they've got cactus on the menu; chilaquiles; queso fundido; rabbit; and cotija cheese that, while it's becoming more common, is still strangely missing from many Mexican restaurants.  I had the veggie enchiladas with pumpkin-seed mole sauce. ¡Delicioso! We split the guacamole (fresh, yummy, and served in a nifty cold-stone dish). They have Pacifico on tap so I snagged one of those too.  Our server did this odd thing where he would hover, decide he didn't want to interrupt our conversation, and then turn around and walk away just as we were ready to give him our attention. But we weren't in a hurry, so it was more endearing than anything else.  Really happy this place is just down the road from me. I am quite sure I will be back."}
{"text":"La Mestiza has a very strong grasp on the Fry-o-lator arts. Here is a shot of the -half- basket of fresh and hot tortilla chips they set down in front of you before ordering.  You will have a devil of a hard time finding better tortilla chips in all of Madison. These are amazingly crispy, warm, flaky and just bursting with flavor. This -half- basket of chips are worthy of a visit to La Mestiza all by themselves! Why they only brought us a -half- basket, I will never know.  For whatever reason they come with a total of 3 tablespoons of two different salsas (that's not much). A rather flavorless Tomatillo salsa and an absolutely fabulous smoked chili salsa which I really needed about 10x more of, which easily would have still fit into the tiny salsa bowl it was provided in. The tiny amount of salsa in each bowl was so little it made dipping chips into it almost a moot point.  We got some Flautas de Pollo, or Chicken Flutes. It's pulled chicken which has been rolled in a corn tortilla and fried. Simply dressed in sour cream and a green salsa. The very simplicity of this dish is what makes it great.... plus fried! yum! All over a tasty appetizer more about the chicken later.   I got the chicken enchilada's with mole sauce. This mole was an absolutely delight, A great mole sauce is not easy to make. It's a balancing act often using dozens of ingredients from pine nuts, pumpkin seeds, peanuts, plantains, to chocolate, cinnamon, garlic, onions, always with a host of peppers to form the backbone of the sauce. It's a little sweet, a little spicy, and chock full of a complex but balanced flavor. This one was excellent. Easily the finest in Madison.  We also ordered the Chicken Enchilada's with Mole Verde. This was a very different sauce then the first mole, full of pumpkin seeds and fresh herbs. It was much more fresh and vital then the other mole, and not as rich. Absolutely tasty and well worth the visit.  Both of the enchilada's were tasty and the sauces were filled with incredible flavors. However the chicken inside of them was rather bland and flavorless with the texture of chemically tenderized meat. As a blank canvas for the sauces it does well, but I can't help but think that La Mestiza is missing out on a fabulous dish by using it this way.  The half measures for the chips and Salsa's at the beginning of the meal could have just been an oversight, but it doesn't give the most welcoming vibe to this, stuffed into a strip mall, restaurant with entree's in the $12-$15 range. The food is well worth the price, but the atmosphere leans towards the cheaper end.  All over a delicious meal and well worth a stop.  Check out all my reviews at theglobeonmyplate.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town. So many reasons - and every time the hubby wants to go to the Other Decent Mexican place, I have to run through my list!  1. The best chips in Madison- are freshly fried and served with 2 homemade salsas, spicy chipoltle and avocado/salsa verde. These are brought out right away. (we have never waited longer than 1 minute.)  2. The margaritas are made with real lime juice and are delicious!  3. They have Negro Modelo on tap, most nights.  4. The chef KNOWS what he is doing in the kitchen. He cares and this is shown with the way he plates his food and the general freshness and attention to flavors. The guacamole is fantastic. The cochinita pibil is Amazing. The steak ranchero is perfectly cooked. And the lamb chops!!! The fish tacos are very good. All the other tacos are great too.  After 3 years of eating here, we finally met Chef Antonio because we go crazy about the lamb chops special. This is only available sometimes on Wednesdays and only if you ask for it. :) (OK, now I have let the cat out of the bag)  But You can have chicken enchiladas if you want."}
{"text":"La Mestiza has great food. I especially love the enchiladas mole verde. It's a delicious vegetarian dish with pumpkin seed mole. The servers are always extremely friendly and accommodating of our toddler."}
{"text":"The food was great, the service was a little lacking.  We had the \"special\" which was a carnitas make your own taco special.  The taste was great.  The chips were tasty.  The guacamole was good.  The biggest complaint was the service - maybe just an off day."}
{"text":"Some good things: Tortilla chips, Tostadas de Tinga, Flauta de Pollo, and the restaurant itself is clean, good parking.   Things I didn't like or were just so-so: The salsa - I'm just not a fan of this style, which seemed to be very thin/liquid. Didn't taste bad, just wasn't what I was in the mood for. Neither were tomato based, which is what my preference is. The service - one waitress seemed very pleasant and responsive. Our waitress clearly did not want to be there, and did not want to be working. Our waitress misunderstood the order of another customer, and when the customer insisted that she get what she actually ordered, the waitress made a face as she walked the other customer's dish back to the kitchen.  My husband did not like the Pollo en Manchamenteles. Sauce was too sweet for him and price for what you get was high.   So, hit or miss."}
{"text":"Love the housemate chips and salsa. This may be my favorite restaurant in Madison. Their food is cheap and authentic.  I take all my out-of-town friends here and haven't met a person who didn't enjoy their food."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I would come here more if the prices were a bit lower or their portions grew a bit. There are a lot of other Mexican restaurants that offer more for less. Granted I love their food at la Mestiza and have been here a lot. I still recommend this place for the \"fancy\" night out."}
{"text":"Sometimes when I start to write a review, the reviews of the people that have reviewed the place before me totally mesmerize me, and I feel more compelled to review the review than the restaurant!  I had this whole scathing paragraph all typed out, but when it comes down to it, really, you should just check out La Meztiza.  It's definitely authentic.  The chips are the best in town, but the salsa is not.   I wish they had a slightly bigger menu, and it seems just a tad pricey for the portions.  The place is in a strip mall next to Pegasus Games, there shouldn't be any pretensions.  All this being said, I want some right now."}
{"text":"Wait and kitchen staff were chatting amongst themselves and didn't seem particularly interested in seating us despite the fact that several tables were open. We never received some of the food items we ordered but were still billed for them. Our waitress was no where to be found long after we had completed our meal. Once she did arrive with our checks they were the bills and credit cards of the people a few tables over. On the positive side, the tacos were great. The house margarita was okay but I'd advise against the sangria. It has banana liquor in it which I didn't think worked very well. We came here on recommendations from friends so we will likely return hoping that this was an off night for the restaurant. Hopefully a more pleasant experience in the future."}
{"text":"One of those times I nearly missed out on a great place due to some misleading reviews. Sure, it's not dirt cheap but it's quality. A touch larger than a hole-in-the-wall, La Mestiza was cozy and welcoming. The menu is succinct, and it's a sign they actually focus on what's on it. If you want a long, inauthentic menu, there's a Taco Bell not too far away. The more options on the menu = the less quality there generally is. Not every cook is the master of every single dish.   Decent selection of Mexican beers, and tequila for a smaller shop. Their house margarita was quite good and cheap. Good michelada as well, and a heads-up to anyone who only has seen them con Clamato, theirs is just the classic spiced/lime beer cocktail.   The complimentary chips were freshly made and came with two salsas (not pico de gallo if, again, that's what you expect). Top notch enchiladas verdes, and perfect refrieds (order as a side). The sopa azteca was also tremendous.   So with each meal, each drink, I was waiting for the reasons why this place is hovering above 3 stars, and I couldn't find anything. Is it more expensive than Los Gemelos? Certainly. Is it worth its price when factoring the quality and freshness? Definitely.   I'm as guilty as anyone when it comes to having a a Yelp 4 star review threshold generally guide my dining decisions. Having said that, I'm really glad I ignored that for once. Anyone staying at the Radisson (or in the neighborhood) looking for good Mexican food, this place is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have no idea why a previous reviewer would give this restaurant a 1 star review, saying it is on par with Taco Bell. In my opinion, the 1 star review is undeserved. My husband and I had lunch here today and we had a wonderful experience. The food was excellent and made from fresh ingredients. The waiter was efficient and extremely friendly. The prices are very low - most lunch entrees are between 6 and 7 dollars. The decor is colorful and fun with local artwork on the walls. I highly recommend this restaurant for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Really really good Mexican food. Not your standard fare compared to other Mexican places in Madison. Tasty pumpkin mole sauce. They have really good cafe de oja. Of course the salsa and tortilla chips are the best."}
{"text":"For Madison, this is relatively decent Mexican food.  For Madison.  My husband and I have been there twice now, once for dinner and once for the weekend brunch.  When we were there for dinner, I really enjoyed my cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork), but my husband was very unimpressed with his dish (\"something with chicken\" is all he recalls).  We also had an appetizer that was basically shrimp tostadas, but was so heavily saturated with lime juice that it basically just tasted like limes.  The margaritas were pretty standard, though appreciated (iirc, it had been a trying day for me).  When we went for brunch, I was very unimpressed with the huevos a la mexicana, but my husband's huevos en salsa verde (which I had also considered), were pretty good.  The pomegranate margarita was also quite tasty and not too sweet.  Overall, they just seem kind of hit or miss--and their misses aren't HORRIBLE, but their hits aren't really that impressive, either.  We might end up there again just because it's close and reasonably priced, but it's not somewhere I get excited about."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place must be crossed off my list. We ordered tamales and they were mush...could not tell which was cheese and which was chicken. Waiter also couldn't tell. Other food tasted fishy, possibly fried or warmed in a pan that had been used for fish. We had.not ordered anything with fish."}
{"text":"Discovered this place awhile back when family was staying at the hotel down the road and we wanted somewhere within walking distance. Thank goodness we did a Yelp search, otherwise we never would have seen it! It's small and in a random strip mall...but don't judge a book by its cover. The decor is very neat and the food is incredible! The chips are always warm and delicious, and La Mestiza has some really unique entree options when compared to Mexican places I am used to. However, the organization of the menu is a little confusing, and the service is hit or miss. Easy things to overlook-- I would definitely recommend La Mestiza!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went with her parents for lunch the other day, and we both had an identical experience, which was, \"This is tasty, but it's definitely not what I ordered.\"  She sent her tacos back and got them replaced and they were fine.  I ordered the huevos ahogados and got huevos rancheros, which is puzzling, because the waiter actually came back to ask me to clarify what I wanted, and it said huevos ahogados on the ticket, but something happened somewhere that resulted in my being unable to acquire the desired drowned eggs.  I was planning on ordering the huevos rancheros the next time anyway, so I'll just flip-flop the sequence, but 50% of our table had a mistake in their order, and I wish it hadn't been the case.  Other pros: good chips, very good salsa, pretty reasonable prices for upscale-ish lunch plates.  Cons: service was slow/inattentive, mistakes in our orders  I'll give this another try, and there's potentially another star in it for these guys if future experiences are better."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my coworkers and I am glad we did, it was delicious. The fresh made chips were warm and the salsa was refreshing. I ordered the lunch special which was carnitas. It was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, somewhat unique and, for a strip mall, the place feels kind of cool.  Portions are big, chips and guac are awesome (best guac I've had in a long time) and service is good.    What stops me from giving more stars is the price.  I know, I know, its good food.  But it is in a strip-mall and it is Mexican food.  I guess I would rate 3 1/2 stars if I could.  But to drop over a $100 for 3 entrees, some apps and some drinks is steep for strip-mall Mexican.    I do like the place and I do go back, but it pains me a little to pay for it."}
{"text":"Oh, the carnitas. I mean, come on. How can pork simmered(usually in lard) NOT be delicious. Exactly. For some reason, the last two times I've gone to La Mestiza, they've had carnitas as the special, and I can not refuse. Mmmmm, tasty.   I've been looking over a few reviews, and yes...the prices are a bit high, but we ALWAYS take home part of our meal. The portions are large. Also, I have found Dine Madison and Groupon deals for this restaurant a few times now, which basically means half price tastiness opportunities abound."}
{"text":"We went there with a Groupon coupon, and found the food and service much better than expected. This is not your average Mexican restaurant. The menu is interesting and imaginative, and the service prompt, informative and courteous. But most importantly, the meals we had, Cochinita Pibil and a salmon special were very good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very frustrating experience trying to order the happy hour tacos, per Steve L's recommendations. The happy hour specials were not visibly posted anywhere on the menu or at the table.  After being seated, we asked the server the following:  Me: \"do you have happy hour right now?\" Server: \"yes\" Me: \"Do you have happy hour prices for tacos?\" Server: \"yes we do\" Me: \"We'd like two orders of the happy hour tacos\" :points to tacos on menu:  We received our trio of tacos tacos, asada, pastor, and pollo.  The pastor was more citrusy than many other tacos al pastor in Madison, although it veered a little close to tasting like BBQ sauce.  Overall, the tacos were good but I'm not quite convinced of best tacos in town.  Chips are excellent, fried in house and not overly oily, and the salsa is great too (some sort of tomatillo and red salsa)  Margaritas are pre-mixed, happy hour prices, but definitely not best margaritas in town.   Next, we had the chicken mole avocados. I would have appreciated refried beans as the standard side instead of the iceberg lettuce. The enchiladas are pretty good but more pricey than other enchiladas in town by a fair margin.  When we received the bill, we were charged full price for the tacos, despite specifically asking if they were a happy hour price.  We pointed it out to the server, and she said that we were charged full price because we received a steak taco, but she said she would talk to her manager.  She returned and said that the manager would not allow the happy hour price. I was displeased because I asked in detail about the taco price, and she never said that I would be charged full price!  Upon leaving, I spied a tiny printed sign near the entryway about happy hour.  And it said \"trio de tacos\", which is exactly what we ordered!  Previously, I have been to La Mestiza for getting tamales to go on weekends, and those are a decent vaglue, but I am definitely turned off from returning here for eating in."}
{"text":"Great food..love their mole sauce and hot sauce served with tortilla chips. Tried their  tacos, which are decent..I've had better ones ..Tres leches cake  is out of the world. Overall good experience, will definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I am not an expert when it comes to Mexican food, and I am definitely not the expert on the authenticity of a Mexican dish. But I absolutely loved my experience here, and I can say that the Mexican food and the drinks I've had here makes me want to return again and again.  I came here for dinner on a Tuesday night with a few girlfriends. We were seated right away and immediately greeted. The restaurant is small and seating is pretty limited (absolutely not recommended for a party larger than 4). However, the smells are inviting and savory, and we felt welcome and comfortable.  I ordered the traditional margarita and had the mojito after. Mojito, hands down, best mojito I've ever had. Fresh, minty, sweet perfection, and if I had the choice, I would've had seven. For dinner, I had the enchiladas pollos verdes. Chicken was shredded and moist. And the sauce was delicious. Rice was forgettable, but the entree and drinks made up for it.  Service after receiving our meals was spotty, and it took some time and effort to receive our check. However, I plan on returning again very very soon!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! Time? 1:00 pm on a Saturday. Who? Me and babe of course, post yoga! Started with chips (flakey and nummy) with two salsas: green and red, both very tasty. I had the carnitas on special and babe had the taco trio: carne asada, pastor, and some kind of delicious pollo in a red sauce. Everything came out super fast and was expertly seasoned. The carnitas came with beans, rice, onion, and cilantro with three corn tortillas. I'm extremely impressed."}
{"text":"I lived with a family who ran a restaurant in Mexico for a year and this is the most authentic Mexican food I have found in Madison. A wide range of delicious foods and beverages. The carnitas are great! Not the typical Wisconsin big sloppy burrito place."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food.  Crap service.  Normally I can overlook sub par service, especially if the food is worth it.  This is an exception for me.  Actually walked out before our drinks even arrived (first for me!)  Server was beyond rude and even my kids said it seemed like our existence in the restaurant was a real problem for him."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 but my mother raves about this place so I figured I'd round up this time  Mexican food around Madison is a painfully dismal affair. The country has so much to offer culinarily but everybody seems stuck on 2 dollar tacos with refried beans and rice. Someone call Rick Bayless because we need some fucking help  This place is a touch more expensive and a touch more diverse than a typical Madison Mexican joint. If you only get tacos here you've lost the plot, kid. I get the sense that whoever is in the back only put those and enchiladas on the menu because of where we are. Word of advice: get the specials unless they sound awful. I like the cochinita pibil, sopa azteca is worth ordering if you have a large appetite. Chips and salsas are free  If you are looking for a beef burrito or some enchiladas I would turn 360 degrees and moonwalk out of there because you're paying 3 dollars too much for what you get. Go to Tienda Los Gemelos instead which is equally diverse and much cheaper"}
{"text":"This place is nice. I mean the chips and salsa are out of this world, but you only get one basket and have to pay for another. In a world of endless chip baskets I felt like I was paying for water. Total first world problem here.   The guac was also delicious. My meal was normal."}
{"text":"Its hard to find authentic mexican food in madison when everyone tells you Laredos is the place to go. La Mestiza fills that void. Vibrant flavors and great selection make up a vast array of authentic mexican dishes at La Mestiza. My favorite things on the menu are the Cochinta Pibil and the Chile Rellenos. The Nopales (grilled cactus) are to die for as well as a side. Overall i can't say i've ever had anything bad here but i usually stick to the waiters decision."}
{"text":"The menu wasn't what I expected. This is not your typical Mexican restaurant that has combination plates. It's a variety of dishes that come with some decent rice that looks great. I only ordered the three tacos from the appetizer section. I didn't want a full meal. The tacos were very filling. They were: beef, pork, and chicken that were very flavorful. Cilantro and onions of course -- authentic. It was definitely worth it. I got a side of guac which was cheaper than ordering it as a full appetizer.   I will probably venture to this place again. I am interested to see what their lunch is like. When I went, there was a family celebrating a birthday, two older couples having a nice quiet double date, and me and my friend. The chips were delicious. I've been looking for a restaurant with their type of chips and I finally found them. The search is over! The best part is that this is so close to La Michoacan! Ice cream, micholada, or paleta after dinner anyone? YES!"}
{"text":"It is very authentic Mexican. I can appreciate the skill and quality in the food, but I am a weak Americanized Mexican kind of fan. Don't go there expecting chimichangas. But if you are a foodie, adventurous, or prefer Authentic Mexican, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Very authentic mole, just enough spice with the sweet.  Delicious guacamole. Hand squeezed margaritas.  Vegetarian refried beans. Not a taqueria.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"La Mestiza is really good. Coming from Southern California, I didn't expect to find any authentic Mexican food in Madison, but we gave this place a try and damn it was good. They even had nopales! Yum!  As for the people who say it's expensive: where do you eat normally? Taco Bell?  The entrees average around $13-15 and while the location doesn't exactly prepare you for that price, it is by no means expensive. My basic thought is that if you think a $6 appetizer and a $15 entree are too pricey then maybe you should look at eating at microwaved burritos at Pedro's or something.  Also: DELICIOUS CHIPS!"}
{"text":"Very underwhelming experience. In town with family from San Francisco and seeking an authentic Mexican restaurant in Madison.  The food in general was bland, baskets of chips inadequate, service was poor."}
{"text":"What? A hole in the wall Mexican spot in the middle of a strip mall next to a competitive board game shop? Yes and thank you. I think you can really judge a mexican spot by the quality of their chips, and this place nails it. Chicken tacos are amazing as well. Reasonably priced, and pretty much impossible to beat in terms of Mexican dining in Madison. Loses one star for ambiance, which sort of feels like a Mexican themed diner."}
{"text":"5 stars it is.   The chips are not my favoritest nor is the salsa as I prefer a different style.   This place has the best:  1) Ceviche (which I never get to have due to shellfish allergy but they offer a shrimp ceviche that works).  2) Guacamole. hands down nothing else to talk about   3) Strip Steak - cooked to the right temp every time. not overly cooked and chewy allowing for full flavor and smokiness to dance on your delicate taste buds.   4) Flank steak on the chilaquiles y tacos tambien. My duna en la Republica Dominicana would be impressed. Dominican food and Mexican cooking are not the same so know this: de Tex Mex, chicanos Y mexicanos es mucho mejor todos los dias. Promesa.   5) Service.  6) Deals offered 7) owner involved and super sweet 8) Drinks per my guests are always worthwhile and hit the 1,2 punch without being overpowerful 9) The kid loves the quesdillas nortenas Y everyone we introduce them too plus the Shrimp Diablo is banging. Pow pow pow   I would try and be cheeky saying, \"Don't go. Say away. I don't want this to become the uber hipster spot then it's over taken and I lose my favorite seat in the house.\" But Im' not that kinda fake funny and this guy deserves to blow up. Awww Hell~ it's just that good."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican place in Madison.  The food is very thoughtfully creative.  They also have a great happy hour with Margaritas, Sangria and tacos.  Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was solid.  Had the cochinita pibil. It wasn't as good as some other favorites of mine, a little dry.  Fantastic flan!  I've craved it since I had it the first time. It's huge though, so be sure to share with friends."}
{"text":"While La Mestiza is perhaps the only Mexican place in town with an atmosphere worthy of date night or merely eating in, this life is such that it's just another takeout stop. Throw in a couple kids who don't like Mexican food and interrupt any attempt at date night anyway, and the result is that I never eat my tacos hot.   Maybe that sounds dirty, but that's just you and the truth is this: La Mestiza's tacos are incredible, even after 15 minutes of transit time in the car. We always order the trio de tacos from the appetizer menu: one chicken, one asada, one al pastor.    The chicken is the stewed, pulled kind, marinated in a bath of delightful spices and cooked melt-in-your-mouth tender. The al pastor is grilled, quality cuts of pork, with a hint of tropical fruity flavor. The asada....just ok. Kinda tough and doesn't pick up the grilled flavor. The tortillas are good; hard to judge after the commuting time but they hold up well. The salsas also win -- fresh green tomatillo, spicy and sweet; red pepper, tangy and hot.  Someday we'll sit down here and enjoy the service of the friendly staff while conversing over sangria and actual entrees, but for now La Mestiza will remain a regular on our terrific taco takeout tour."}
{"text":"After some extensive searching here on Yelp, my husband and I decided to try La Mestiza for dinner. The place is tiny, but we actually enjoyed the intimate atmosphere. The waiter was quick and responsive despite being the only server for all the tables. I order a margarita and was blown away. It was the best margarita I had ever had. The flavor was just the right amount of sweet and salty. For dinner we both had the enchilada special which consisted of 3 enchiladas in a red, white, and green sauce. The portions were smaller than what you'd usually see at a Mexican restaurant but I'd say they were perfect. I loved the dish and didn't feel like I'd over eaten. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here after buying the Groupon and wasn't disappointed. The chips and salsa you get prior to the meal were good to munching on. The food arrives quickly and the portions are big. The only drawback is the food was a little bland. But for the reasonable price and portion size this place is ok."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, both with the Groupon for a meal, side, and margarita. I'd definitely pay full price here though.  They have GREAT specials- last time I had pulled pork. They also had amazing crab-stuffed peppers which my boyfriend loved. The sides are good too- the cactus nopales and grilled green onions had amazing flavor. The fried plantains were a little smushy. The have interesting entrees that aren't your typical Mexican restaurant food- I had salmon which was cooked perfectly and topped with fresh pineapple salsa.  The margaritas can be a little unreliable- the first time we came, they were overly sweet. The second time, we went early on a weeknight and they made them fresh, not from a prepared pitcher. The server said they use sweetened lime juice, not a mix. They were pretty tasty on my second visit.  Atmosphere wise, it's not great- it's in a strip mall on the west side. It's near the discount movie theater. Inside, it's booths and tables- definitely nothing fancy. But the food is much higher end than the surroundings!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place. We came here for an early dinner in the middle of the week and I was admittedly a little skeptical at first.  Walking in, the atmosphere and the decor was very good. It made me feel like I had entered someplace local; not a chain Mexican place that was also trying to be a bar.  When we received the menus, I was disappointed that there weren't lengua tacos or tamales (my go-tos) but I was surprised by how tasty their complementary chips and salsas were, so I asked our waitress for a recommendation.   She recommended the lamb and it turned out to be really good. My girlfriend also enjoyed her meal, which were the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde.  The one drawback was that their horchata was a little small for the price, and they didn't refill our chips (just an oversight, I think, since I saw the waitress refilling others). Not a world-changer but still a pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be recommending fish tacos in the Midwest, but yum ... Try these! I've only had one meal here, but they use fresh ingredients that make me think their dishes are all quality."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times for lunch or dinner and it has always been thoroughly enjoyable.  This is good, authentic Mexican food-- a bit \"fancier\" than the other good authentic places (Los Gemelos, etc) but by no means a fancy place.  I usually go with whatever the special is at lunch, and it has always been good.  Service has always been friendly and efficient.  Only disappointment I had was with one of the shrimp entrees at dinner, which came with only four (four!) shrimp.  Other than that one-off, no complaints!"}
{"text":"Usually good food trumps awful service but good food can't trump no service. Came in for dinner on a Tuesday around 6. They were somewhat busy and I only saw one waiter hovering over a computer in the bar area. The sign said seat yourself so we did. Patiently waiting for those tasty chips they're so well known for felt like forever. Eventually a large family came in and we saw them be seated and given menus. I'm a fairly patient person (my boyfriend very upset and said they better not get served before us) we still hadn't been greeted or even looked at. I saw another waitress pop out of the back and service three tables in a row and proceed to walk past our table without even a brief greeting. Well that was the last straw for me. No matter how good your food you can't blatantly ignore customers and service only a large table. I have never left a restaurant under these circumstances before. It would have been a different story had we not seen a table get service before us but watching that and being ignored tipped the scale. I'd give them zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy restaurant.  The food is fantastic.  The guacamole is outstanding.  The carnitas on Saturdays are worth returning for week after week.  It's usually a good idea to listen to the server's advice on the specials.  This isn't tex mex it's authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place! I have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant and everyone has been suggesting La Mestiza. It's a little pricey for Mexican food so we made a point to go for Happy Hour and we were told it would be well worth it either way.   We were greeted by a nice young lady named Silvia (it said on the receipt) who promptly filled our water glasses. We asked what the Happy Hour specials were and she said, \"Oh gosh (long thoughtful pause), I don't even know...it's been so long since anyone has asked.\" At first, I interpreted it as \"hey D-Bag, you're at a gourmet restaurant and the price shouldn't matter.\" I gave her the benefit of the doubt.    We ordered a margarita and a can of Tecate (which are $4 and $2.50 during H.H. since Silvia isn't going to know). She came back to the table and I thought she was going to ask salt or no salt but she forgot the order in the 30 seconds she was away; she never asked about salt but I didn't care.   Side note: the Yelp check in offer is for a $7.95 lunch special but the specials range from $5.99 - $7.99 so don't even bother checking in.   I thought the margarita was fantastic. No fake green color or sweet and sour mix - 5 stars for a house margarita.   The chips were also fantastic, light and crispy, and came with a mild green and \"hot\" red salsa. Both had good flavor but there was barely enough in the dishes to scoop onto the chip and neither had much heat. I noticed on the menu that a 2nd basket of chips was $1 and each additional salsa was $0.50 which Silvia was pushing heavily. I commented on the lack of heat and she asked me if I wanted to try one of their hotter salsas. I happily agreed.   I got the happy hour taco trio of Al Pastor which were top notch! I also really like the new hot salsa. Silvia also forgot this order and had to check back again.   In the meantime, a guy came in and ordered a margarita. He asked several questions that he didn't like the answers to or Silvia didn't know the answers to. He tried the margarita and informed the waitress that he didn't like it and wanted to go. She brought him the check and he refused to pay for it. From what I could gather, Silvia was saying that he drank some of it so he had to pay. She wouldn't take it off the bill and at one point I heard someone say that they would call the police if he didn't pay for it. A manager came out and eventually took it off the bill but only after a few more minutes of arguing.   Finally, I got my check and I was charged $1.59 for \"trying\" the hot salsa even though the menu states that salsa refills are $0.50.   To summarize, the drinks were really good. The food was great. The service was totally spaced out at best. But, overall I felt like they were trying to nickel and dime people. Charging for chips and salsa, bogus Yelp check in offers, overcharging for salsa refills and shaking the guy down for a margarita he didn't care for.   If they made a few tweaks to their service and pricing, this could easily be a 5 star place."}
{"text":"First of all, am I alone in thinking it's extremely odd to walk into a  restaurant on a Thursday night at 5:30pm with a lighted \"Open\" sign in the window, to find the restaurant is completely empty and, after loudly saying \"hello\"  2 or 3 times, you find you have to call them on the phone in order for someone to come out from the back and discover that someone is inside the restaurant and would actually like to eat dinner there? Well......  I should have just emptied the cash register and gone my happy way.  But no. We sat down and ordered.  So, am I also alone in thinking that when you order the Jicama-Cucumber Salad, maybe they shouldn't serve it to you if  \"the chef apologizes that we don't have any jicama today\". Just sayin'.  But seriously.  The waiter set the plate of shredded iceberg lettuce covered with slices of cucumber drizzled with dressing and said exactly that.   Then, the main course arrived. I ordered the special enchiladas.....  ....Awe forget it.  I was going to describe just how horrible this meal and this experience was, but I can't bring myself to waste my time.   We were there until 7:00pm and nobody else ever came in the place. They must know what we didn't know yet.   All I have to say is: Take a pass on spending your money on  \"La Mestiza\"."}
{"text":"Closest to Los Angeles Mexican I have found in the Mid-West, Madison. Before the discovery of this gem, the closest I found was Taqueria Guadalajara on Park street. The Trio de Tacos are my constant go-to's. It's exactly what it's called- a trio of tacos, (pastor)pork, chicken and  carne asada steak tacos. The pork taco is my fave. The flavors are exactly the taste of home- no cheese or extra stuff in it. Just good meat and cilantro and onions. Meat is cooked right, sauces are flavorful and authentic. The prices are cheap. The tortilla chips are really authentic and delicious. Service is excellent- everyone's friendly & acommodating. Give it a try and see what your favorite dish is, because other dishes like the enchiladas, quesadillas and mole are all good!"}
{"text":"Their guacamole is the BEST I've had! Make sure you order some when you go!"}
{"text":"The menu is very limited. We ordered and the first few customers ahead of us had a long wait for their food. We had about the average wait. Our food was cold and tasteless and my fiancé noticed his food didn't match the menu's description. The customers after us received their food in record time, which made us wonder if the food is pre-made and heated up.  We will not come back here."}
{"text":"The food is hit or miss, the service is pretty much miss.  The family decided to check this place out on a Friday evening based on a recommendation of my wife's co-worker.  The Rick Bayless Everyday Mexican cookbook holds an esteemed spot in the kitchen, so I'll admit I set the bar pretty high when evaluating this style of cuisine.  We arrived at 5 pm and our server promptly took our drink order, but things started to slow down.  Despite having three servers working five tables, it took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and a small complimentary basket of chips.   Did I mention that the basket of chip was small?  Our party of four devoured them in three minutes, but no one came by to ask us if we wanted more.  (It should be noted that the first basket of chips was free, after that, you'll be charged $2 for a bottomless supply).  The chips were the star of the evening.  Hot, fresh with plenty of crunch.  I would make the trip to the west side just to get another fix.  The consistency of the salsa verde was a disappointment.  It was far too watery, making it difficult to get the right balance of salsa and chip.  I also enjoyed the Quesadillas de Rajas y Queso we ordered as an appetizer.  The corn masa coating was cooked to perfection, but I would have preferred a Mexican cheese over the mozzarella used as the filling.  The roasted poblanos were excellent and a small serving of crema was a welcome addition to the dish.  After a long wait (about 20 minutes) and only one refill of our basket of chips, we received the entrees.  I ordered one of the specials, a beef barbacoa based on the recommendation of the server.  The beef was tender, but a little under seasoned.  The dish was overpowered by a pile of raw onions that topped the beef.  I like onions, but these gave the dish a sulphery aftertaste.  The sides also were disappointing, the re-fried beans were overcooked and lacked texture, the Mexican rice was mushy and bland.  With the little more focus on the details, this could have been a great meal.  The kids ordered cheese enchiladas and chicken enchiladas. The salsa verde lacked punch.  The tomatillos really needed to be roasted longer to give the green sauce more depth.  The chicken was well cooked but under seasoned and I was frustrated with the the use of mozzarella as the filling for the cheese enchiladas.  There are some great Mexican melting cheeses that could have vastly improved this dish.  After another long wait, we finally received the bill which totaled $65 before tip for our group of four.  The meal cost was reasonable, but I can't really recommend La Mestiza given the below quality of the food and service I experienced."}
{"text":"This place is really tasty! I made the mistake of getting take-out though (not a bad option if pressed for time), I would definitely recommend eating in if you have the chance, it really is a nice atmosphere and the free chips/salsa served if you eat in looked scrumptious!  Everything was very delicious; it definitely tasted house-made and fresh to boot! The prices are a tad bit higher than your standard Mexican establishment, yet, their options are more plentiful and held to a standard that rivals any spot in Madison.   I definitely would go back to try some other dishes and the house-mole looks fantastic!  Also, don't forget to check in with Yelp to take advantage of a discounted lunch special!"}
{"text":"Having recently relocated from southern CA, where REAL mexican food is available on just about every corner...I was really disappointed moving to Madison, where I feared I would never taste my sweet favorites again...but then my 3 year old wanted lunch, we were in the strip mall with this hole in the wall restaurant and he insisted we go there...being hungry, I agreed. WOW...my son has great taste!!!  This place has the best Mexican food outside of central Mexico! The flavors are rich, pure, and strong...the textures delight your tongue as the smell overwhelms your nose resulting in a giant smile just below! We went back and took the whole family, same great service from the same waitress...it makes me think this place is family owned!  Anyways, if you are looking for REAL mexican food (not bland and americanized)...check this place out!! It isn't much to look at but the dishes are beautifully created, worth every penny and bite!!! Oh, and they do take out and let you order OFF the menu as well...if you have a special taste in mind!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authenticity in food I wouldn't suggest coming here. It lacks spicy food and it's just dissapointing. The chilaquiles I got were sweet? Which made it unappetizing. The enchiladas red sauce tasted like tomato soup. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"It's not Taqueria Guadalajara, I'll tell ya that much.  But it's better than a Doritos Locos at 2am and that says a lot coming from a guy who's a 2am Doritos Locos connosuier."}
{"text":"I'd like to give these guys at least four stars, but they're going to have to refine a couple of items to get there.  Let's start with the food... definitely worth the trip.  The shrimp ceviche, which another person said 'tasted like limes', is an excellent starter... and tastes like limes because that's the way ceviche is made (with lime juice doing the 'cooking' of the proteins with the citric acids).  The guacamole is also quite good... no frills, just tasty.  The entrees that I've had there (been twice now), have all been quite good.  The Cochinita Pibil (pork dish) was great, while the lamb chops were slightly overcooked... but still good.    My biggest issue is the presentation... of the food and the location itself.  The shrimp ceviche shows up on two fried flat tortillas... making it difficult to eat (can't pick it up, do I make this into a salad?).  The guacamole is spooned onto a plate.  The dishes come out without much for frills or presentation... and everything is served on big boring white plates.  The exterior has no sign, there is nothing in the windows, and the interior is fairly stark beyond the brick walls of the building.  I'm sure with some time, they'll step it up... but probably should get after it sooner than later.    Overall, yes, I'll be back... as there isn't much for good Mexican in the area of the square, so that's a bonus... but I'll look to them to refine and improve quickly in the coming weeks before they fall off 'the list'."}
{"text":"Everything was top notch.  Had the fish tacos with some grilled vegetables as a side, more then enough for a meal.  Homemade chips were some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Chips and salsa are home made and awesome. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My latest visit to La Mestiza is not what I remembered from a few years ago.  I'm not sure what changed.  The dish I ordered was decent.  I should have changed the sauce from the verde to something more brown (adobo or mole).  It was alright, but I could have enjoyed it more.  Nothing here really stood out that would make me come here FIRST.  I'll come here again, probably, but if it's my choice, there are so many other places to go."}
{"text":"Great guacamole & enchilada con mole! Surprisingly delicious given the strip mall location.  My food was served promptly."}
{"text":"La Mestiza is a great alternative to the chain Mexican restaurants. It's very casual and comfortable, and the employees are friendly; the restaurant and bathrooms are clean. You can sit wherever you'd like--stay away from the front door if you can because it gets drafty in the winter.  The food is authentic, with the best Mexican rice I've had in the area. Free chips and two different kinds of salsa are served right away, and they're very tasty.  Entrees are a bit pricey, but probably have a good quantity--I've always gotten the quesadilla appetizer to eat, and it comes with rice and beans and is very filling as a light dinner. For the amount of food, the appetizer is quite cheap, and there are several other inexpensive but appealing appetizers I haven't yet tried.  The reason I'm not giving it five stars is because both times I've been there, they didn't have any tamales (which are on the menu), and one of the times they were out of jamaica (a Mexican drink made from hibiscus flower). Other than that, it's a great place and I'm sure I'll return many times!"}
{"text":"While the food at La Mestiza is decent, the prices are not. If you're looking for cheap, delicious tacos, I'd recommend Taqueria Guadalajara instead.  The atmosphere of La Mestiza is rather pleasant. They have low lighting in the evenings which makes the warm colors of the walls and decorations glow. The entrance way is blocked off by hanging tapestries so the cold doesn't blow directly into the restaurant which is nice as well.  My friend and I ordered relatively soon after sitting and our food came out in a timely manner (right as we finished our chips and salsa). I got the Trio de Taco (I ordered all steak tacos which is a dollar extra) and horchata on the side. The tacos were decent; nothing to brag about, but not bad either. However, I did not think they were worth $9. The horchata seemed to have more cinnamon than I'm used to, but that was fine with me because I love cinnamon. I was surprised that the glass my friend's margarita came in was the same type of glass that my horchata came in, not a true margarita glass.  Overall, this restaurant was just so-so. It was a nice atmosphere to eat my food in, but I would prefer the cheaper and more flavorful food at Taqueria Guadalajara."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that you see from the outside and move on. When it comes to food, never judge it from its cover. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. I can't remember what I ordered, but I can recall the the mental snapshot I took for the food."}
{"text":"The best I can say about this place is average. Nothing outstanding came through the meal. I had the enchiladas verdes. The chicken was under seasoned and made for an average enchilada. The plate came with rice and salad. Beans were \"extra\" which was irritating and tasted canned. Plenty of other better Mexican restaurants in the area.  Service was good. I wanted to really like the place based on its ratings, but it isn't that memorable."}
{"text":"Bad! This place does not look like a Mexican restaurant (but that is not the problem) and the food does not taste like Mexican food. The food actually was not tasting good. The menu had just a few options. You should do not trust in a Mexican restaurant where you don't see any Mexican guy inside. They know where there is an authentic food from their country."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Madison!  Sunday they have a chorizo special which is simple and delicious.  Also, good margaritas and reasonable prices. I love La Mestiza! Don't change anything."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for some solid Mexican food and margaritas and found La Mestiza rated highly on Yelp and TripAdvisor. We pulled up to a strip mall and gave each other the \"uh, do we try it?\" look of worry. We manned up and went in, and we are so happy we did! We immediately got a seat in the small restaurant, and the waitress was taking our order with a smile within the first 2 minutes. She made recommendations based on our tastes and she did not steer us wrong. My husband enjoyed a margarita and fish tacos, and we split the guacamole, which was very fresh and delicious. I had the enchiladas in the pumpkin seed/almond mole and it was just like my mother-in-law's homemade enchiladas! I loved it! Our waitress forgot to bring the guacamole, and did not charge us because of the mistake. That was very nice! I am only giving this place 4 stars because the Horchata was a little bland and the Flan was average, but the rest of the meal was so good and the waitress so nice that we will go back again!"}
{"text":"I'm all for quaint family owned and operated places because there is a lot of potential and undiscovered delicious dishes. This is not one of those places. They need to apply to be on Restaurant Impossible because they need an overhaul. Their decor makes no sense whatsoever and the food was horrible. Their chips and salsa was great but it's pretty hard to mess that up. What's up La Mestiza?"}
{"text":"I really love their food here, I've been visiting regularly since I moved into the area over a year ago. But I was really disappointed on my last visit to find out they now charge you $1 for any basket of chips after your initial first. I came here with a group of 4 people, and we received only one basket that was about half full when we arrived. If you're going to charge $1 for each basket after that, PLUS another .50 for the salsa, then be gracious enough to give us a full basket in the first place or at least one for every two people. :( Awfully sad, we'll be going elsewhere that doesn't charge us out the nose for things that are usually complimentary at other mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"This Mexican joint on the West side is pretty tasty overall and fun to visit for lunch.  Pros: vegetarian options, authentic Mexican cuisine, friendly service, free chips  Cons: geographic location (not close to anything), physical location (it's in a strip mall), could use a renovation  Try this place out with a friend but save it for a lunch date when you need a quick cheap bite!"}
{"text":"I give La Mestiza five stars because I've been there over a dozen times and still want to go back regularly. It's definitely one of the two best Mexican restaurants in Madison.  As other reviewers have already commented, their homemade chips are the best I've had anywhere in the country. If you go there for lunch, one of my favorite's is their Tre Tacos. The pastor (pork) is the best but all three are quite good. I usually get three pork tacos though since the swine is the king of all meats!  Oh, and speaking of pork, on Friday nights, their weekly special is pork shank with cactus. It's one of the best meals in Madison for the price!  La Mestiza's flavor re-kindles memories of going to a Latino friend's home and being treated to the skill and knowlege of generations of mothers and grandmothers. If you like authentic Mexican cusine, check them out."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place because I have heard so many positive reviews; both from my friends as well as fellow Yelpers. This was my third visit.  I just don't think any of the food I've ever tried there was that delicious-none of it, except maybe my child's cheese quesadilla.  I do however, appreciate the staff-the are super courteous, friendly, and seem like they really \"want to be there.\"  Great Margaritas-Great.  I wish more restaurants would use the age-old margarita formula of basic quality ingredients: FRESH lime juice, tequila, simple, orange liqueur=Boom!  Life's too short to ev-uh use a pre-mix.  Summary: Go there for drinks and maybe chips n' salsa."}
{"text":"Because our server was so absolutely friendly and fantastic, I have to give this place 3 stars.  For food, however, I would give it a 2, and the only thing allowing me to go that high was my husband's Cochinita Pibil.  It was layered with flavors of sweet and savory and seemed very \"Caribbean.\"  Delicious.  The green chili salsa and red salsa served with the \"too\" hard chips to start the meal were not good.  The green chile salsa tasted and appeared completely watered down...almost like tomatillos soaked in water...very thin and with no other flavors.  The red salsa was strictly one note...lacking that sweetness that should accompany anything \"red.\"  We also ordered the guacamole which I think would have been good if they would have used salt and then thoroughly mixed it.  At one bite, the lime overpowered...the next bite the complete lack of lime left it boring.  The accompaniments to our dinner, refried pintos and rice, both lacked salt and seasoning.  At one point, I asked if they had any other red salsas, and the waiter brought us something quite divine.  Although it was \"green,\" it tasted red, sweet and like ripe tomatoes....delicious.  I don't know why that wasn't served up right from the beginning.  I know this is a review based on few food choices, and I wouldn't normally do that, but we are just passing through, and I don't want other passersby to make our same mistakes.  I would look at the other reviews on Yelp and choose a menu item that is frequently reviewed and rated highly."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good and service is nice but nothing extra special or traditional about this place. I think the decor and service makes it seem like its nicer then it is.   The enchiladas verdes were good but again similar taste to other average Mexican restaurant around like Larados and Casa del Sol. Don't get me wrong I like these places and La Mestiza. But La Mestiza hasn't really stood out and because we've been going to other places for a longer time we just prefer them if we are going to get semi non traditional Mexican food."}
{"text":"La Mestiza knows how to do dips and salsa right! I have never tasted anything like the tomatillo salsa that comes with the complimentary homemade tortilla chips. It only got better with the freshly made guacamole and the rich mole sauce on my enchiladas. The chicken was a little dry and it definitely needed the sauce.  The margaritas were delicious and they don't mess around with a glass half full of ice. They are straight up with only 100% agave tequila.   The music was very loud and a little distracting from our conversation. The waitress was very friendly and I'm sure would have turned it down had we asked.   There is a lot more I would like to try on the menu, including the Cochinita Pibil (slow roasted pork wrapped in banana leaf), so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure I see the appeal of La Mestiza.    I've been twice now, once with a group of friends and once with my girlfriend, and both times I left with a lot to be desired.  The atmosphere is agreeable, with a small selection of tables/booths and a quiet social feel.  If there's any plusses that would be the biggest one.  Most Mexican restaurants that I've been to in my life have been either noisy, basic, or non-traditional, and La Mestiza definitely gets points for having it's own style.  As you walk in, they have the entrance blocked off by stage-like curtains, and the overall dining area is peaceful.  One of the first things you'll encounter after sitting down is their lovely chips and salsas, which are delicious as others mentioned.  There's something sweet in taste about the chips, and the green salsa is probably the only of it's kind that I've ever enjoyed.  Now that the good part's out of the way, let me tell you why I'm giving La Mestiza only 3 stars.  First, they are extremely overpriced.  The drinks and appetizers are reasonable, but almost every meal is $12-18, and for Mexican food that's just too much.  If it were something I was impressed with, I'd be a little more generous in this area, but for food that came off as incredibly bland, this price is not something I can settle with.  I've tried their first chicken dish on the menu (can't remember the name), the tamales, and their enchiladas.  All of these selections had a very basic description, but once they were served you found yourself with a meal that was chock full of ingredients and smothered in unfamiliar sauces.  My first Chicken dish had a handful of things I'd rather not eat, and so I had to basically take a few bites and then resort back to the free chips.  The other two entrees were just bland, with a giant dumping of brown mole sauce and white unknown sauce slathered over all of it.  I ended up cleaning my plate for both of those, but that just left me uncomfortably full and not satisified because there wasn't anything tasty about them.  Taste buds are different for everyone though, and seeing all the positive reviews here makes me think that maybe others just hit something that suit them.  That said, I tried 3 dishes and they don't have a ton to begin with, so I'm still skeptical.  There's also no hot sauce or flavor sauce of any kind, something that is a MUST for me at a Mexican restaurant.  Service was questionable.  At first, it seems very personal, as there are few people in the restaurant and the waitresses come off as polite and prompt.  But the politeness seems fake; both my girlfriend and I were like \"what the hell is her deal?\" almost the entire time, both times.  Both waitresses read the options and specials off in a really robotic manner, and while they showed all the usual signs of courtesy, there was just something a bit off.  I don't know how to explain it, and we certainly were in good moods both times so it wasn't something that we carried over from a previous activity.  It might have something to do with the patrons.  The typical customer seems to be either older middle-aged white westside parents with a dose of snooty, or business women out for a work lunch.  I guess if I was serving that type of clientel all day, I'd be putting on a front as well.  Then again, maybe we just hit a string of bad luck.  So in the end I can't recommend La Mestiza.  While there is truly a drought of good Mexican in Madison, this place just doesn't have enough shine to fill the gap.  If you want good Mexican, drive to Milwaukee and go to the soutside.  You'll get your money's worth, you'll be full, and you'll have a big smile on your face.    And for pete sakes, at least put some Cholula on the table."}
{"text":"Small place. Dimly lit. But decent food. Not a place to have a business lunch but a place where you can bring your friends and grab a decent bite. I would rather take out than sit in here."}
{"text":"visiting from CA & my co workers and i were craving Mexican food. Food was good but service is terrible. It's a small place, I think I made eye contact with the server like 3 times. I understand they might have been busy but some acknowledgment would've helped. Aside from that, food was tasty but I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"We got food to go and ordered an order of chips and salsa with it. The food was good, the chips were good, but the salsa was almost non existent. It came in one of those plastic salad dressing containers - think Jello shot. It was enough for maybe 2 chips. WTH? It cost $1.99. I am not sure what is up with that or if you get more when you dine in, but the carryout version is a waste of money. Will definitely try eating there, but probably will not carryout again."}
{"text":"Service was good and prompt. Pickled onions on my meal were good. Side rice and beans on the bland side. Pork was dry. Now the good; tasty food. THE BEST tortilla chips and guacamole. Authentic Mexican food. Would come again."}
{"text":"La Mestiza is one of the best places to eat authentic Mexican food. The staff is friendly and quick. Anthony the owner even catered for our wedding for a low price and the dishes he made were both American and Mexican foods. I couldn't see how anyone could rate this lower than 4 stars."}
{"text":"People get fussy about Mexican restaurants. Is it authentic (which region?)? Is it Americanized? Is it just like the Mexico they saw when they went on vacation? Are they from SoCal or Texas?  There's a place for platters of rice/beans and cheese covering 'something' underneath served with chips from a bag and red or green sauce. Then there are places that seem more real.   La Mestiza is one. It's a notch or two up in feel and decor from Tac.Guadalajara and a bit fancier and pricier that La Guanjuatence. The menu is more limited and they seem to want to focus on doing a few things really well. They succeed. They have Negra Modelo on tap, always a good sign. Real Margaritas (talking to you La Guanjuatence!) are a win. The chips were freshly cooked, hot and delish!  Spousal Unit had the Chicken Mole enchiladas. I love mole. Theirs was good and she loved it. A little too sweet for my tastes and it could have been spicier (I say that a lot in Madison). I had the Yucatan classic, Cochinita Pibil. Nicely presented and flavorful.   Unlike some of my favorite Mexican places, this is a place you could go on a date."}
