{"text":"I looooved this place! We started with the lobster artichoke dip and it was very tasty! Both my partner and i had the peacemaker poboy, he had fried and corn bread while i had the bacon chowder and we loved every second of it! Lots of flavor, big portions and everything was cooked perfectly. The staff were amazing and so considerate! Best experience at a restaurant in a long time :) sending our love!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Went there for the first time yesterday. My wife and I both had sandwiches and the dip. Came out fast and tastes awesome.
The service was great, they knew the menu inside and out and they have great drinks. 
I'm definitely going to be a regular here!!
See you guys soon"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon Po'Boys while checking out Yelp for places to eat. Thought it would be interesting to try a new place, that served creole cuisine here in Calgary.

We ordered their fried oysters to start. Was told there were 6 per order, a good enough reason to share an order with the Hubby. I have to be honest, when that order of fried oysters arrived I was rather disappointed. The oysters were very tiny! Not only that but it was just greasy. Mind you this order came out in a saucer plate. The container holding the sauce was bigger than the oysters itself.

My husband and I, both ordered their steak frites with lobster butter and served with duck fat fries. The entree took a little longer to come out and the owner did apologize for the wait. Reason being was that they were thick steaks and they were just making sure the steak was at the right temp. When our entrees finally arrived the steak wasn't evenly cooked. Part of our steaks was in the medium well side and the rest was medium rare. Not a huge fan of medium well cooked steak. Though I must admit that the lobster butter was a nice added touch to the steak. The duck fat fries were seasoned well and wasn't greasy.

The saving grace to this meal was the dessert. Our dessert was comped due to us waiting for quite a bit on our entrees. Even if it wasn't comped, I still would've ordered their bourbon  bread pudding. The bourbon caramel was enough to lure me in! The bread pudding itself was nice and tasty! It had the right amount of moisture that it didn't make it soggy. The caramel with that hint of bourbon.... Yummy!

Overall, I think the place looks nice. Since they've only been opened for two weeks, I know that they still have a lot to improve on. I'd like to come back in a month or so, and see their progress.

Best of luck to you Po'Boys!"}
{"text":"My few visits to New Orleans were back before the flood, but included some of my more cherished culinary experiences.  One of those really great experiences was chawin' down an oyster po'boy, which I haven't tasted or heard of since.

So today, I greatly relished the experience again with gusto at PoBoys Diner, new place on 50th and McLeod.   The place is casual but very new and clean.   The menu has a lot of Cajun/Creole dishes, but I had to have that Oyster PoBoy and glad I did.  The oysters were nicely fried and all the sandwich fixings fresh and tasty.   Washed it down with a nice pale ale served by John the convivial native Louisianian bartender.  

Then just to cap it off, I was surprised with a lagniappe!!   Yeah, look that one up, a real Louisiana ticket.  In this case it was a single hot beignet, Delicious, just like being at Cafe du Monde.

So a number of things I don't know where else you would find in Calgary, Oyster Poboy, Beignets, and a Lagniappe (maybe those will catch on here).

Pricewise, far less expensive than travel and american exchange.."}
{"text":"I'm not a frequent eater-outer, being quite content with the food that I make at home. There are many great restaurants in this city that I should have tried by now, but just haven't got around to it. So I guess it says something about my appreciation for po' boy sandwiches that I visited Po'Boys Diner in the first week they were open.

Now, they are in a soft launch period, so one must mind that context when offering a review or feedback. I think it is fair to have different expectations in the first week, compared to four or five months in. They are not at full menu yet, so I didn't get to have the oyster or shrimp po' boy that I was hoping for, but that's ok. That said, the menu that they do currently run is a bit confusing. Make sure that you ask what your choice of sides are, as that's not at all clearly laid out. 

My friend and I each had a pork belly po' boy, and I added a starter of gumbo. I'm not making this up when I say it tasted authentically N'awlins, and was just as good as any I had in The Crescent City last year. It was all fresh tasting, hearty, and delicious. We split a cheddar jalapeno cornbread. It was tasty enough, but I don't think it was worth the $5 tag.

Both of the owners stopped by our table to see how we were doing, and that was a really nice touch. They seemed genuinely pleased that we stopped in for a meal and were very gracious.

The warm beignet we ordered for dessert were ridiculously good, and even provided on the house. Just because they were being nice. I appreciated that. The serving was huge. For the $4, you only need one order for two people (though that may be soft launch quantities, I don't know).

I'm looking forward to their full menu, and for the launch of their brunch menu in December. While I am quite content with the food I make at home, a tasty, authentic po' boy seems out of my reach in my own kitchen. The pricing at sub-$20 for most of their entree orders (or even sub $15 for some items) makes this happily within my range of preferred meal pricing. I'll most certainly be going back. Probably more than I should."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here this evening. We didn't realize that it was the opening night. I really don't want to write a negative review - but for the prices these guys are charging everything should have been spot on. I realize some growing pains in a new restaurant are normal - but again, things should be sorted out and spot-on perfect for opening night. (If it isn't, or can't be...shouldn't you/ wouldn't you wait? I would.)

We will go back in a month or two and give it another chance, at which point I will update my review but for now here we go.

The Good:
Decor looks nice. It's updated and has a much cleaner feel and look than the previous Blind Beggar Swill-Hole.
Staff is very courteous.
Service is fairly quick.

The Bad
Only some unnamed house wine on the menu along with soft drinks and coffee.
(we were told that the bar would be fully stocked in another day or two???)
Debit/Credit isn't available - cash only. (We weren't informed of this until the bill was brought to the table)
Prices are on the high side for simple cajun/creole food, nothing really stood out or \"elevated\" the dishes to the point to warrant the prices being charged.
Only one proper toilet in the men's room along with a single urinal. (given the seating capacity they should have at least one more throne in there)
Some weird electrical issues going on with the lighting while we were dining. (flickering/dimming/flashing really bright)

The Food:
I ordered the Jambalaya, with a side salad -
Salad was fresh, dressing delicious, goat cheese very goat-cheesy.  All in all, a very nice little salad. 
Jambalaya was cooked to the point where the rice had all but disappeared into mush in the dish. There were only 2 pieces of sausage and 4 shrimp in my whole thing. My portion size, despite being the \"Full\" more expensive size, was not very large at all. Was more like a larger side-dish serving.  The chicken was fairly plentiful as was the onslaught of red and green peppers. The seasoning was good, not too salty as can often be the case with cajun/creole food. 
When asked how it was I said it was merely o.k. and that I was rather disappointed. 
The owner came to talk with us, (I'm assuming the owner) and mentioned that yes, he understood that the Jambalaya was mushy and he understood my disappointment. He then told me that it was like this because it was made yesterday and merely re-heated today. 
EWWW - I paid $18 for day-old, re-heated Jambalaya? Ick. Major no-no in my book. Your entrees should be made fresh everyday. 

My wife ordered chicken and waffles with a cup of bacon corn soup.
The soup was lovely. Smelled and looked delicious...judging by the way she wolfed it down it must have tasted divine!
Waffles were nicely cooked, however the chicken was not crispy and in fact was under-cooked.  The batter was doughy and uncooked on the inside and the middle of her chicken was underdone. It could have used another 3-5 minutes in the deep-fryer, methinks. Suffice it to say - she did not finish her meal.

Again, the fellow apologized. 
To his credit - he did offer us free dessert as a mea culpa. I think the whole meal should have been comped, but I'm not into making a scene or stamping my feet, so we accepted his offering with a smile.
We ordered the beignet. They were made fresh and brought warm to the table. 
There were a LOT. We could have shared a single order and still had left-overs! 
Warm and covered in icing sugar, if not slightly over-soaked in oil, and a little denser than I've eaten in the past. But not the worst I've ever had. Strongly middle of the road.

Overall impression:
A great concept. A nice look and feel to the place. But sadly, missed the mark on the entrees which is the MOST important part of a restaurant if you're going to be a sit-down restaurant and not just a tapas bar, or a pub.
LOTS of growing pains to overcome in the coming days/weeks. 
I hope they last longer than 3-6 months so they can get all the kinks worked out of their menu, electrical, payment and bar situation.
Staff was very friendly and nice, and the owner was very genial. Frankly the staff's demeanour and the owner's attitude is what won us over. 

We'll be coming back for a second try in about a month or so. 
We're rooting for you guys! =)"}
{"text":"I had the privilege of being one of the first of I'm sure many many more customers to the po boys diner . The staff was outstanding the food was exactly like it is in nawlens. The seafood gumbo and pulled pork po boy I had was washed down with the best hurricane I  have ever had . The benights are better than the ones at Cafe dumount in New Orleans, which by the way is usually lined up a block long . Anyway if you like great food at a affordable price coupled with amazing service check out po boys diner ."}
