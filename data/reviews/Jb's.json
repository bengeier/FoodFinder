{"text":"Whenever I offer to take my mom out to lunch somewhere, she usually says, \"Let's just go to JB's.\"  I really don't really get why she likes this place.  It's just another Denny's to me, perhaps slightly better, with a more sober clientele.  But the menu is filled with the same choices and has close to the same pricing.  I think the food is fine.  Not awful, but not good either.  The fried stuff makes perfect hangover food and there is a pretty good breakfast buffet on Sundays.   But this is also a popular family joint, and that means grubby, sticky little hands will be touching the same items you're putting on your plate.  Think about that before you shovel a portion of scrambled eggs into your mouth.   I've also had the desserts here and they're pretty good.  They have the standard brownie with ice cream and some pies and they're all tasty.   All in all, if you're hungry and don't know where else to go, JB's isn't the worst choice in the world. And before you read the next sentence, just know, I'm not a kid hater, I swear.  But my advice is to try to get to the buffet right when it opens to avoid the dirty, unattended kids with syrup smeared all over their faces."}
{"text":"If I say it wasn't as bad as I was expecting is that good?  2.5 stars.  I have only eaten at a JB's once.  That was in Price, UT probably 3 or 4 years ago.  It was memorably bad.  So when I offered to pick up lunch for an employee and they picked this place I was expecting the worst.  I went in with diminished expectations.  I played it safe with a BLT, fries and a shake.  It was OK!  Yay!  The BLT was actually almost....well...pretty good.  Hey that wasn't as bad as I thought it would be!"}
{"text":"This location is out of business. I drove by it on my way to Costco and it just has a giant for lease sign."}
{"text":"This is just a basic (albeit mini) chain greasy spoon. I had a decent burger with guac and soda. I would give three stars, except for a) good service and b) relatively low prices. I'd probably return if hungry nearby and a Costco meal was not appropriate."}
