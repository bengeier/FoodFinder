{"text":"I just called to see if they were open to the public & they said no, only to tour busses. They of course may chose to run their business anyway they wish. If they don't want my money, I can find plenty of businesses that do!"}
{"text":"My adult daughter and I had lunch here last January; this will be my first meal stop when I return to Las Vegas area in August.  I can hardly wait.  Neither of us is Asian but we dine on Asian food more often than on any other ethnic variety.  I am an octo-generian who has been eating Asian food since I was first introduced to solid food as a baby.  My parents liked it that much. I live in an area of California in which many, many Asians live.  Walk along any street and there is some sort of Asian restaurant behind every door or two that you pass. I know most of them. So....I feel qualified to comment on the food here.  It is as good as I have had in fine, expensive Chinese or pan-Asian restaurants in the USA or abroad.  As another reviewer commented, it is light, well seasoned, and authentic. The variety of offerings is amazing. For those whose exposure to Chinese food has been at a small town \"chop suey\" joint or one of the \"one main dish plus chow mein or rice\" chains, try to stretch your taste buds and learn what good Chinese (and some other Asian) food has to offer.  You'll never go back to \"chow mein and cashew chicken\" as a meal again."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????? it is not good. the restaurant has few kinds of food. how can it be called buffet? and it tasted is so horrible."}
{"text":"I've been to the Las Vegas Buffet in Torrance, CA and I enjoyed the food & ambiance there. So when my family saw the sign of the restaurant on our way home from Henderson, NV we decided to drop by, only to be told that they are not open to the public. They strictly cater to tour buses. WHAT!!!! I have never heard of such a thing. Why display the name and offend locals?  In a city where locals are respected, this is a slap in the face. I am trying to understand their reason but my suggestion, meanwhile, they should take down the sign or put a message on the front door that they only serve tour buses. \"No locals allowed\".  On the other hand, no great loss here... majority of the blogs (assuming from the tourists that they only serve) gave the restaurant one star only. And these tourists who are mostly Asian would know if the Asian food is good or not. Actually my one star rate is for me being offended as a local.  I wasn't really given the chance to rate the food."}
{"text":"NEVER go to this place. Trust me. I'd rather use my Franklins as toilet paper than spending them at a restaurant which shuts the door to their awaiting customers."}
{"text":"This place apparently services large swaths of Asian tourists; at least two or three busloads came in while we were there.  Food was okay. It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't terrible. Nothing really stood out. They have a few American items on the buffet, which were actually probably some of the best items there. Variety otherwise was extremely limited; at least half of the items they had up were seafood, and most other things were vegetable dishes.  Otherwise, it's strange. It's like a buffet with service (they refill your drinks and such) but at the same time there are drink fountains in apparently-public places, so it can be a bit confusing if you aren't entirely sure what should be going on.  Not terrible, but the lack of variety hurt."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst buffet I've ever been to!!!!! We came after the lunch rush but the quality of food was not there. Mostly veggies and no meat. If I could give a zero star I would but that doesn't give me that option. I've notice this place caters to a lot of tour busses. Honestly, I would tell them to go to another buffet place!"}
{"text":"High price, low quality and bad taste. It's not Chinese food nor American food. Don't recommend it."}
{"text":"If i could give this place zero stars, I would. We came here as a part of a tour group that was visiting Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon. The tour that we were on pretty much forced us to eat here. The selection of food was terrible for a \"buffet\" and the quality of the food was barely worthy of being swallowed. Basically this place sucked. Don't come here. If you are part of the tour group that forces you to eat at this buffet..save your money. Eat at one of the buffets on the strip."}
{"text":"This is the least authentic Chinese food I've eaten in America, although the decoration and the service are pretty good."}
{"text":"One of the lady service attitude was bad to us! And there are few choice to eat . The food taste so so, not good. The price is not deserve its service and food. Anyway, I just satisfied with that everything was cleaned."}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving it a single star, but honestly it doesn't deserve any better. This is the absolute worst restraunt/buffet i have ever been to. Absolutely disappointed. It smells like fart everywhere, and I swear I'm not the only one who smells it. The scent is strongest around the food, and to be honest I dont want to be smelling fart when I 'm going to eat. Also, the food quality is very low-quality. The clams are not fresh, bananas are still green, and the broccoli is bitter. NOT AUTHENTIC AT ALL. Having been to China and eating real Chinese food all my life,I can vouch that this isn't authentic. The food has no heart, it seems as if the chef doesn't care about who they are feeding. The food here makes my stomach hurt and I definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"You can't imagine how terrible they are! Horrible foods! Actually, none of my friends like it. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were so hungry. Now, we are leaving, and we are still hungry! ???????????????????"}
{"text":"worst buffet ever? soup is too light? service is awful? fail to refill the empty plate?"}
{"text":"I don't recommend going to this place at all. The food is cold and with little variety. And the taste is not good. Avoid it if you can."}
{"text":"Worst place ever .. Employees treat you like you're in communist china. Food looks like it's been sitting there all day. Ice cream machines are broken. They can't even get French fires right. Worst service EVER"}
{"text":"Nice and clean buffet, lots of seating. Didnt mind paying $13 per person but then was alittle disapointed when i noticed they had a huge selection of pork to choose from. Not a huge pork fan, would rather take my $13 next time and eat at Buffet@asia because they have more selections to choose from, more seafood and mongolian bbq."}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible Horrible Horrible...  Worst chinese food ive ever had !!! Nothing was freshly cooked...and nothing was authentic. .will NEVER return, EVER...toom a couple bites and felt the urge to throw up. Not the place if your looking for good (real) chinese food."}
{"text":"lunch$13? close at 2:30 it's more a all you can eat Chinese restaurant. Very classic Chinese taste. All the food taste great!   Clean, cheap, and the service is super friendly !    We went there late, the owner even gave us a discount! Nice place!"}
{"text":"Came here b4 and good customer service.  So came back again. Last time they told me that if I come b4 12:30 pm it's happy hour and price is $5.55 even for to go..  So I came here b4 12:30 pm today.. they told me to go order is $8.33.. no happy hour discount.  I explained how I've been told. They didn't give me a happy hour price.  But gave me some discount. They have different type of dishes that you don't see in other Chinese buffet.  This place is very clean and nice customer service.  Very good quick lunch at GV area.."}
{"text":"Have been sent to this buffet by the tour group twice within 7 days. Food is just ok for us Chinese."}
{"text":"I haven't never been to a Chinese restaurant this classy with great environment with beautiful decoration. For the price u paid is way worth every bit of it! Enjoy the traditional Chinese Southern and Northern exotic flavor... Yummy!!! The place is really clean. I recommend this place if you guys like Chinese food and hang out with your family!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! How could a Chinese food restaurant in Las Vegas did so bad on its food..."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!  No customer service  Empty pans  Food was discussing, even the jello and ice cream, couldn't get those right. I live right across the street And I'll never go there again, don't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet restaurant I've ever been. Limited food with poor quality, bad service. Just get away from it as far as you can."}
{"text":"Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Eww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This is not a real Chinese buffet!!!!!!!!!!!!plz do not insult Chinese food!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Taste not good, only few selection, there are plenty asian buffet with more tasteful at similar price or cheaper price.... Many people come here with their tour package..."}
{"text":"I used to live in a small town East side of the U.S. I thought they are terrible enough but I just found out they are paradise to me compared with this place.  The worst buffet I've ever been before."}
{"text":"I succumbed to the hard sell of my chinese tour bus guide $15.(buy one get one free lunch buffet) from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on May 13. 2015. Our tour bus was one of six, whose passengers had deboarded for their meal. We were only given 45 minutes to eat.   Yes, it was hectic and the lines to the bathroom were long. Since i was in a group of 3, someone collected the food as we took turns queuing for the restroom. The kitchen was trying their best to keep up with demand.   I was raised on authentic Chinese cuisine, and my selections included the deep fried pork chops, the steamed pork bao, and pan fried gyoza. I made my own dipping sauce, since there was no black vinegar to dip them in. The rest of the selections was pretty mehhh!, but I was able to put something edible together.  On our return trip back to Los Angeles, the tour guide billed it as a brunch buffet. The buffet featured smoked tea eggs in the shell. Their napa cabbage was braised with dried shrimp, which I liked.   I did sympathize with our western bus driver, who was from Texas, and was freaked out by the asian food. Since he didn't eat anything, I just gave him my oreo cookies since it was a 6 hour drive bk to LA!   All in all, the brunch was acceptable."}
{"text":"The table is dirty?no waiters to serve you. The favor is bad. I feel nothing good to eat."}
{"text":"So I have been to alot of asian/chinese buffets, and this was definitely not a very good experience for me. I went on a tour to vegas and the first buffet they took us to was here. The server forced us to sit with people we didn't even know, when there were plenty of tables to sit at. The food itself did not taste like the cook/chef even cared who he was serving or what he was cooking. Alot of the food was unseasoned and the broccoli was very bitter (as though not washed). At least it was somewhat edible. It was just very sad to eat. ($20 per person) Other than that, the restaurant was very big and the servers were quick to clean up our plates.  I do not recommend this place if you are a person that truly appreciates good food."}
{"text":"Lol no.  Their food has no taste and is very limited.  This is the worst food I've tasted in a restaurant. Though, I did eat here a couple times cause we pre-paid for it as part of the tour. Still sucked."}
{"text":"Very limited food choices, not fresh and terrible taste. Highly recommend you not come here."}
{"text":"Fix your ice cream machine. My first visit was on a Thursday, and the machine said it was broken. Yet my second visit was on a Tuesday, and it still wasn't fixed.  WARNING: Anticipate angry tourists pushing each other as they hunt for low quality Chinese food. These tourists will FIGHT to grab chow mein, fried rice, and orange chicken that accumulate to a massive plate of grease.  ADVICE: Add diversity to your menu. Since the majority of customers are tourists, your menu should accommodate their inability to consume a dish that derives from only 1 ethnic culture. As a \"buffet,\" the Chef should serve a variety of meals to eat (e.g. American, Italian, Mediterranean) instead of serving only Chinese food. After all, the Las Vegas Buffet is a buffet, hence the name."}
{"text":"Your typical hometown Chinese style buffet.  It came out to be about $15 with tip and tax for lunch.  I've definitely had better tasting Chinese at other establishments.  I would only recommend coming here if you are a local in Las Vegas.  If you are from out of town, then definitely hit up the strip for a much better food experience."}
{"text":"Food absolutely sucks, fries are the only decent things. Food is stale and cold and the fruit is hot and mushy, the apples look two weeks old. Ice cream machine is broken. No milk for coffee. If our tour guide didn't trick us into coming here we wouldn't have. Stay away from this place. Me and my partner got sick after eating food from this crapbuffet."}
{"text":"The worst buffet I have ever had, the service is poor, the taste is poor, the only thing taste right are the fruit, the cucumber is strange too. I don't think they opened the ac during the summer."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of buffets, but this is an exception.  After reading the reviews on this place, I absolutely do NOT understand all the 1-stars and the comments of this place being low-quality, unauthentic, and bad service. This is going to be a long review because I want to serve this place justice. I feel as though the previous reviews are holding this place to the standard of unauthentic Panda Express. I've been here twice, because I was on a Chinese bus tour full of straight-from-China families who felt that it tasted like home.  Since this location does have a lot of Chinese tour buses coming in, it does get quite packed, but there are still lots of seating. You have to be quite patient in getting your food through the buffet lines.  Service is pretty good, friendly, and inviting. The entire buffet is REALLY CLEAN (including the restroom) and modern!  There are ALWAYS workers standing by the bars cleaning up any small spills and taking empty plates.   As for the food being unauthentic and low-quality. No. This is by far the best Chinese buffet I've been to. If you're a person who prefers Panda Express or super-greasy-MSG-filled Chinese food--this place is NOT for you. They do not even serve your typical American-Chinese orange chicken or overly-seasoned chow mein. The food here is just the way I think it should be.   Hey, I'm a little Asian girl. I think I have some say in what is considered authentic. AUTHENTIC Chinese food is actually really light in taste, rather than heavy, greasy, and oily. It seems as though the reviews are holding Panda Express to their standard of what it should taste like. Comparing it to other Chinese buffets, you are able to eat so much more because the food ISN'T heavy. You're not going to get that fat feeling you usually get after eating your second plate at a typical low-quality Chinese buffet or after eating 2/3 of a Panda Express plate.  Regarding the range of selection, there are a lot more authentic dishes here than I've ever seen at any buffet. Some of the selections are atypical of your American-influenced cuisine because they're more native dishes. TRY THE DAIKON RADISH SOUP! It's one of my favorites.  Though I do not intend to be rude, I'm going to comment on some of the reviews I've seen on this place for the sake of all of you who want a broadened review:  \"Beef of broccoli had no beef. Sweet and sour sauce- but no chicken.\" --This happened to me for a particular food, but that's not an issue of the restaurant, but an issue of customers' tendency to gravitate toward the meat. Waiters do refill the buffet lineup quickly.   \"Waitress filled our drinks once, and never came by for a re-fill.\" -- Why the heck is this even a complaint??? There is an open drink bar where customers fill their own drinks!!!!!  \"As far as the so called food. ..tasteless.\" -- Like I said earlier, this is a matter of preference on a scale from Authentic to Panda Express. I would say the food is light rather than tasteless. The lightness of the food was a better perception of real Chinese food and was the best part to me."}
{"text":"The shittiest buffet ever. If you go on the tour and they stop there, just starve.. Not worth it. DO NOT spend that $15 or \"$19.99\" as they advertised at the restaurant. Seriously..I think it is a gimmick for tourists. It doesn't even deserve any stars."}
{"text":"The Worsed Buffet!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fruits are from the canned food.  Not edible at all. No soup and not a single shrimp , crab nor any seafood excpt claim. Congee no taste at all. Spare ribs just heat it up from microwave.It's really a Zero star or negative. Staff are not even friendly."}
{"text":"The worst buffet I ever had. I don't even want to give one star.  Less dishes, no taste at all."}
{"text":"A real vegas gem! Authentic asian food that is actually fresh. Great variety. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the Original las Vegas buffet. I just enjoy every bite.       The buffet has everything you could asked for and the food tastes positively gourmet Quality !  Brand new restaurant with best service . They even just got Double \"A\" from health department!"}
{"text":"Excellent low cost Chinese Buffett!  Surprisingly only 11 bucks for lunch. A lot of seafood for such a great price."}
{"text":"Simply just not impressed. I've had better Chinese food buffets for less. The only reason I went out of my way to the city of Henderson was because of a groupon I received.  I will say, however,  that the place was very clean and the service was good."}
{"text":"Came here with a tour group and didn't realize what I was getting myself into when I pre-purchased meal tickets to this place. Unfortunately, this buffet is pretty bad.  Very few food selections and tastless. Overall a very bad place and I would not recommend eating here.  The positive side is that the employees clean off the tables very quickly."}
{"text":"You have to try this buffet to see what is the worst buffet in the world!! Food are cold and plain?the noodle and fried rice are cold and so hard!! The soup is also cold and super plain?I would rather drink water. The vege is cold and super bitter?I guess the chef forgot to put salt. In a word?it is the worst reatuarant in the world!!"}
{"text":"Tour guy brought us here. I feel sorry for my stomach, the food really sucks."}
{"text":"Can I give a zero star? No,..it should be less than it.  The worst buffet I've ever had in U.S.!!It isn't worth $15!!!!Well, maybe $8 only.. nobody give me the water , I have to get the drink by myself..,very few selections! No flavor ...Only a little bit meat ?no seafood. Disgusting pastry. Canned fruits . ...It must share profit with those tour companies. Worst ever ever ever ! RUINED MY LUNCH...if not bcz I go with the tour company, I am much more willing to pay any extra money to have a nice buffet on the Strip!  Not recommended at all!!!"}
{"text":"Are you a hungry Chinese slave that hasn't eaten in centuries and love to eat car feces for lunch because a there is nothing better to eat? Do you LOVE being belittled by the waiters telling you exactly what to do? If so, this place will be PERFECT for you! Welcome to a restaurant in America that gives you the authentic feel of a Chinese communist working camp lunch room! So great authentic and communist that they even refuse to make the American fries correctly. Oh but make sure you eat everything or they'll make you pay. If you decide to eat here, enjoy! It's time for me to go let the Hershey's fountain flow..."}
{"text":"Food is ehh.. for $15 for buffet this is the worse I've been to. Joined a Hoover-Grand Canyon tour and was stuck with this food. I wish they would pick a better place."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the god damn (bubonic) plague. It is authentic Chinese trash. If you can avoid this place (because you're part of the las Vegas tour group from an Asian travel agency), go to the tgi Friday across from it."}
{"text":"Obviously this one has special relationship with some Chinese tour companies.  The MAX food value you can eat is less than $3. The people who run this buffet don't know how to cook. The reason People  took this place is they don't have any choice in this small mall  around  110F, their customers just like us don't have any vehicle."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with friend. $6 for chinese buffet. Not all food are tasty. but they have 4 kinds of food that i really enjoyed. We had good time there.  Five stars, just for the price, and their warm service. food needs to improve, but think about the price, never mind.  I can take it."}
{"text":"terrible food and bad service. The guy Stand on the front door are awful.Never back to this place again. It called 15 dollars but only cost 5 dollars."}
{"text":"food is not fresh at all, the jello doesn't even wobble normally, the soda is half water, payed 10$ came out with a frown.tgif is wayyyy better on the other side. Sorry. not worth to go here"}
{"text":"Not a bad buffet, but not that great either.  Nothing noteworthy as far as food items for lunch.  Decent selection but kinda pricey when compared to Buffet Asia or Krazy Buffet.  There were many tour buses that would come and go, dropping off tour groups to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst Buffet ever , never try this one, it's bull sh*t  , the only seafood is baked fish."}
{"text":"Not sure if the regular cook and staff were off duty. The reviews don't match the quality of this restaurant. The cabbage and shrimp were overcooked. The eggplant was so undercooked it was like biting into an apple. The chow mein was 4 parts slimely and 1 part uncooked noodle. The orange chicken was far too bitter and was falling apart soggy. The salad bar was anything but salad. Some weird soups and meats labeled Chinese Specialty.   I was really surprised that the food was so terrible. The place is only open half the day. Because of their short hours I expected fresh food to be available at noon. This was way beneath the standard of cheap Chinese Food Buffets. i would never go back."}
{"text":"This places suck. It has opened on Sunday which is not true. It's only open to the tourist bus. They need to post that somewhere so you don't look dump trying to go in to eat. The one in Torrance California is way better and more Professional."}
{"text":"My family and friends went on a tour bus to Las Vegas. The day when we got their we were so hungry, when they took us to this place, my kids were like yessss!!!! When we got in we were looking at the food to see what they had, when my kids saw the brownie they were like I'm eating this with fried rice. When they ate the fried rice they were like this taste bitter, but they were like I'll try the brownie and they ate it and they said it tasted like oil. When everyone in our group ate the food they were like this disgusting. I like the tour bus and the people but not the restraunt. I will NEVER go to this place again because everyone was so hungry for 3 days. Even though they don't have good food they should at least have good drinks because the drinks tasted like soap  !! It was the worst food and the worst experience!!!!!! We all had diarrhea after!!! They should pay for our medical bills !!"}
{"text":"Just walked into this place and even though people  we're clearly eating they said they don't  take walk ins. Wtf??? Seems like you don't take walk ins for people that aren't Asian because as we walked out they seated Someone that was behind us that was of this origin. I'm not racia t in anyway but it seems this restaurant is!!!"}
{"text":"Heard the ex-5 start hotel Asian chef was forced to leave the restaurant ever since the end of last October, because the then-new management only wanted to serve basic food to their tourist bus clients!  My local friends living in Henderson were even rejected to go in there since they were locals!  Wonder why it starts open to locals and non-tourist buses.  Don't even bother to go there, save your valuable time!  So disappointing that another originally nice restaurant was off the list..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst food ever! A tour bus dropped us and about fifty Chinese tourists at this place.  We paid for the meal before arriving.  The food was cold and old.  The lettuce had mold on it.  On another day the bus stoped here again.  We got a wonderful lunch at Trader Joe's market across the street.  My girlfriend still has nightmares about the food at the original Las Vegas buffet.  (Yes, it was that bad).  Avoid at all costs.  If you are on a bus run by C tours, seagull tours, go to bus or take tours you will stop here because the same company owns the restaurant, according to the tour guides.  Again, avoid this place at all costs.  Trader Joe's has clean, cheap, quick and tasty food and they are across the street. Avoid the original Las Vegas buffet."}
{"text":"Not one to bash a restaurant. But this place is just not for me. Too many people eating there, of course it's a tourist for people visiting Vegas from mainland china. It's just not for me the taste is nothing what I had expected. Service is great. But the food is just not."}
{"text":"??15???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Food was tasteless, selection was minimal, and overall an awful experience. We were brought here through our tour guide, who vouched for the place, so now I have no faith in our guides judgement. The only thing decent in this place was the chow mein. But what another review said before me, how can a place call itself a buffet when it has the same selections as a panda express. You are better off eating at panda express if you want better tasting food."}
{"text":"Came here on a tour bus and both lunches were behh... the seating area is nice but the food isn't all that great. I ended up with rice, gyoza ( pot stickers ), chicken, curry noodles, and what seem to be beef with broccoli. For a dollar lunch (because of the tour) isn't bad, but this buffet needs to improve on their food choices. I had better Chinese buffet experience else where but it is what it is. Their customer service is good and efficient."}
{"text":"Waste of time and money. Paid around $11 for lunch as I just missed the happy hour. Just fatty pieces of pork. I will never come here again. Seems like they were more interested in the tour bus business. They even asked if I wanted to come back at another time."}
{"text":"Better than Panda Express?.... you have to be kidding me... this place was a groupon purchase for my family.  We went there with high hopes after reading reviews that must have been posted by the owners or their family..  because, we will never go back I PROMISE!!!  Even if they said it was free... no way JOSE!!  There were  two Seagull Holiday (YUK)  buses full of people there eating, the food was mostly wiped out.... and the people there were scrambling around trying to find something good to eat... of course only the stuff that no one wanted was still left.... the service however was good, and the sodas were good.. the ice cream desert was not so good...but helped us forget the food.   I feel sorry for those poor people on the bus that have to eat at places like this.    We live in Las Vegas and have been to many buffets.... I wish we would have gone to Panda Express... at least we would have spent much less and the food would be much much better.. and No I don't work for Panda Express... You have been warned....."}
{"text":"Worst buffet i ever had. All food are cold and look not fresh at all. Taste bad as they only focus to serve tourists from china."}
{"text":"What the fuck is this?! The steak is rubber! The fries were too salty. The fried rice was bland. Wow, horrible service."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Asian food I have ever had. The choices are so limited, and the worst part is the food is ice cold. The fries taste like onion rings so I am sure they are reusing the fryer oil. I am absolutely disappointed! I would prefer eating anything else! I came here on a bus tour to Vegas, and I have been looking around and everyone is upset with the food. I looked around earlier and I can't seem to find our bus tour guide. He must know the food is terrible. Where's the food inspector when you need him?!"}
{"text":"???????? ???????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????? ?????\"??\"???????????????????????????brunch"}
{"text":"I drove by this place with my son and decided to try the food.  The lady at the front counter approached me and my son.  She asked for a ticket and I said we didn't have a ticket.  She asked, \"Are you local?\"  I nodded yes and she said, \"We don't serve locals.\"  I asked why and she said, \"We only serve tour busses.\"  To my surprise, everyone in the area looked like asian tourists so my son and I left.  As I looked at the windows of the establishment and exterior of the building, I could not find a sign that justifies what the woman said to me.  But I did see 2 signs containing the words \"Las Vegas\" in their company name.    My question:  How is this business allowed to operate with Las Vegas in it's title and yet they don't serve locals?    No big deal, I went to another establishment that would appreciate my money as this place clearly did not.  Eventually, I would like to see this place open to the public but I'm ok with them shutting down permanently.  Be careful if you're thinking about spending your money here, they don't want it."}
{"text":"I feel sorry for this place after reading all of the single-star reviews. I originally would have given them a single-star since our first visit was taking my parents there for their \"First of the Month Free Senior Day.\" They host this every first day of the month. The selection was very meager, there were a lot of seniors (what did I expect?), and a whole lot of tourist coming off the tour buses. Since I thought this was an anomaly, I had to give them a second chance and I am very glad I did.  This place mainly serves tourists from the buses and local business is more-or-less a second thought, but don't let that deter you from coming. Also, since they mainly serve tourists, they are only opened for lunch till 2:30 daily. On everyday except the first of the month, they have a very wide selection of items (not as large as Buffet @ Asia) but satisfies my hunger (check the pics others have posted). We have been back 5 times in the past 2.5 months and enjoy every bit. The front staff and wait staff service is excellent and they always cleanup your dishes and check on drinks very often. And a big plus for me is that the place is very clean.  Tips:  -Come for the \"Happy Hour\" M-F 11:30-12:30 @ $5.55 (approx.-I forget exact change). Did this on July 4th this year and they do not skimp on the selection for \"Happy Hour.\"  -We mainly come on the weekends and the best time is to come after 11:30 (they serve 1 group of tourists for brunch before this and they start a new batch of items for the next group that comes after 12:30). Don't come during brunch because the item count is not as many as lunch.  I call this the \"Golden Hour\" because the place is pretty quiet during this time.  -Get a Frequent Eater card. Every 11th meal is free.   Price: Local ID $10 and change and for Seniors $7 and change.  UPDATE (11/2/14)-As of 10/27/14, they are no longer opened to the public with the exception of the first of every month. Seems like they just want to cater to their tourist business. Sad loss for us as it has been a favorite of ours."}
{"text":"No idea about the food, but people are disgusting!!  They wont let anybody in to just look into whats available on the menu if we don't have ticket... and the worst part is they have put a sheet saying - \"Restrooms are for Dine-In customers only! What nonsense!!"}
{"text":"Price and Value are not matching! For $6.50 I would say it's a ok, but the food isn't really good!"}
{"text":"I dont know where to start with the fiasco. This place is a joke. Avoid this place and dont even bother trying to give it a second chance. Food is not edible, too SALTY.. the trays are mostly empty when the chinese tourbus pulls up goodluck. When we went there, the soda machine is t working and they refuse to bring real cups so people are force to use coffee cups to get their drinks. I asked the people that work there and she just gave me a shrug. Bad service, bad food and place is dirty, want to waste your money? Go ahead and eat here!!"}
{"text":"Actually I found it was pretty good. It does catering business, but before that it was good. I came with the tour and had a nice lunch there. The price was super low and it was valuable. I like it. I don't understand why people keep writing bad reviews on it, since they paid like $10 but expected a $50 dining. It's not really reasonable right..?"}
{"text":"The worst food I have ever had in my entire life. Don't take seagul/take tours to Vegas because you will end up here 3 days in a row. Not gourmet and poor quality food. Just awful."}
{"text":"I'm here with a bus tour and thought 'oh a las vegas buffet sounds good.' Then we got here and were the first ones here and was seriously disappointed!!  1. No labels for food 2. Not much variety 3. Watered down soup 4. Watered down lemonade  5. Had to get our own drinks (why pay $10+$5 tip if were not being waited on?)  6. Tofu was flavorless 7. Grab your own napkins and forks  Very disappointing! Save your money and eat at the other satisfying nearby restaurants"}
{"text":"Came on a tour bus. Save the trouble and go to TGI Friday. Very limited selection on food. Didn't expected to be like this since I been to other Vegas buffet."}
{"text":"Just arrived to this establishment and was welcomed by the angry communist employees. I had a grand choice from \"Chinese delicacy\"(mystery meat)  to a pure cilantro salad... We'll after leaving I've noticed that I've been having diarrhea since Easters!  Please eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the very WORST restaurant i have ever encountered.  Bought a groupon coupon for $15. For 2 big mistake. Could have paid cash there for much less. They cater to Chinese bus tourist. One bus after another. As far as the so called food. ..tasteless. very limited selection. Lowest quality they can find.  I'm not a Groupon fan and never use it.  But the deal popped up on Facebook and I've past the place a thousand times. Never again....just happy i didn't get sick.....stay away.."}
{"text":"Like many reviewers mentioned,  the food is beyond dry and tastless. I was brought here by the tour guy, probably they make some kind of commission here to bring people here.  Food is terrible!"}
{"text":"I usually refuse to eat at these kinds of buffets, because I think they're dirty & I'm scared I'll end up sick but my step dad insisted we eat here.... The place looked clean & they had all A ratings from the health department, so I felt a little better. My parents liked the food, but personally I didn't find anything great that I liked. Some of the the food I got was cold. They had a lot of veggie foods, however in one of the dishes on the counter the greens looked old. Like other reviews on here, I agree that they need more of a variety of dishes to choose from. $7 @ happy hour, you get what you pay for.   On a good note though, the waiter was friendly!"}
{"text":"The service here is wonderful, we had really attentive and considerate wait staff. This place closes early so be warned. ( 2:30 pm close)  Most of the food is pretty standard, some of it outright lousy, some good. A lot of cheap fried junk like most buffets have. There is salad and oranges available for a healthy option.  There was not much meat, some weird pork things I wouldn't try and some fish. No chicken skewers or anything like that.  I suspect this place caters mostly to buses and a certain clientele and not too many locals. So if you want Americanized Chinese, Buffet Asia is probably your best bet. This place has Thai style chicken curry and other exotic dishes for choices , which were not too plentiful by the way.  The décor is beautiful. The parking is easy. Still none of us liked it ( mostly because our personal preferences, not because of the food taste). I would give this a 2 1/2 stars to be fair if I could."}
{"text":"Got a groupon for $30 for 4. I asked the receptionist/front desk how much is the regular price and she said $10+/person. First, the place is not busy, not even 10 people inside that big place. Second I notice was the dust infront of the receptionist table/counter, she's not busy! Why can't she wipe her counter! I could write my name on it!... Yikes! The one star I'm giving is for the place, it's very classy, minus the dust. Restrooms are clean and can compare it to a hotel on the strip. The servers are very nice and attentive. Gave them a good tip! Food... Half star! Selection was not very good, I guess because they are only open for like a few a hours they only cook one time and that's it! Food is very dry, over cooked and very few selection. The only dessert are jello (my daughter made a comment that it's like a square gummy!) have a few fruits, a pudding, no cakes or cookies. They have that soft serve ice cream. I'm pretty sure this buffet will close in just a few weeks. We left like 1pm and they couldn't even fill up half the place. They are not open for dinner. That's why they charge so much it's not for the food but to pay for their rent. My suggestion go to Krazy Buffet (By Sahara and Cimarron) or Buffet@Asia (they have a couple of branches but the best one was at Spring Mountain and Sahara. You won't even have to pay $10 for lunch and the food is way better than over here (10x way better!) Save your money and just eat at Panda Express, you'll be very pleased! Never coming back here. It's a waste of money, gas and time."}
{"text":"I love this buffet.  It's more authentic Chinese cooking than the americanize chinese foods most of us are use to.  You cannot compare it to Panda Express (which I also like) as these are two different styles of cooking.  I love the fried rice.  It's not so soy sauce laden; it's light and very flavorable.  They also have pig feet.  OMG, delicious with hot sauce.  Not sure what they are called in the Chinese language,  but they are pig feet.  The chef just needs to cook them bit  a longer as they can be very tough when not cooked long enough.  There is so much food on the buffet; plenty of vegetarian items and a good selection of meats.  You should know that I am not Asian but a senior African-American born and raised in Chicago,  now living in Vegas for 1 year and have eaten more Chinese for in my lifetime than I want to talk about.  TOLVB is the first authentic buffet I've found here.  So yummy, yummy, yummy.  So folks, don't be afraid to try something new.   Go in with an open mind and experience cooking thats authentic to its roots.  They have a early bird special price, from 11:30am - 12:30pm, that's only $5.44 and it includes a beverage.  For that price you can afford to give it a try."}
{"text":"This place is a big scam.  No seats for us. No enough food and no one come to refill the food. Bad service. Authentic Chinese trash food. Never never come here. Big scam. Do not come here. Or you will eat a lot shit"}
{"text":"Clean, is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this restaurant. Gotta warn you though, there isn't much of a variety, but what they do have is tasty and fresh. It's more quality over quantity. Like everyone else said, they close early (2:30pm) and it's incredibly cheap (check groupon. I got 2 lunches for $15). They cater to Chinese tourists who come into town in large tour buses. You can tell that's where they really make their business from. The food was kept very clean and everything was warm. The Chinese food tastes authentic. Better than what you would find at Panda Express for sure. The star dishes for me was the curry, spicy string beans and the orange chicken (which is funny cause I don't really like orange chicken). They also had a salad bar with different Asian salads and a dessert area. When they seat you they'll take a drink order which is odd because they have an entire self serve beverage area with an assortment of sodas, coffee and tea. I guess they just have good customer service. The restaurant is very large and spacious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I must confess that I'm a connoisseur of buffets having eating at some of the most nicest buffet in the Las Vegas area from the M Casino to the Rio to a lot of the Strip buffets as well.  Today was the first time being here and took a chance since I bought a Groupon coupon for two.    I was pleasantly surprised of the variety of foods and especially gorged myself on the roast duck, port tenderloin and sweet and sour pigs feet.  The service was outstanding and the manager came by several times to see if we were enjoying their food!  All the food was very fresh and I had 3 plateful of food before having dessert.    I think this place has the Asian Buffet beat hands down and the quality of food was better than any Chinese food I've tasted an any of the buffets I've eaten.  The price is very reasonable and if you come during happy hour of 11:30 to 12:30 it's a definite steal at $5.99!  I guess some of the people who rated this restaurant didn't try all the dishes because if they did they would have known how great of a deal this place is!  A definite A+++ place and will definitely be back several times a month at this place!"}
{"text":"Things you will see here:   1. People shoving each other to get the remaining bits of Kung Pao chicken  2. Rude mainlander tourists  3. Glass that looks like it was shot through  4. The poor non-chinese that just fill their plates with toast, egg rolls and fries  Also, a typical mainlander customer pushed me and made me spill my boiling soup all over my hand. Keep in mind, i'm of mainland Chinese descent.   It's connected to a make-shift gift shop that only sells supplements for tour bus customers as a plus."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese buffet I've ever been in Vegas! They have very good selection of Chinese food that you won't see in any other Chinese buffet! I think my favorites are Peking duck, custard buns, pork knuckles, and sometimes they also have dim sum dishes! When it comes to customer service they are top notch! Super friendly and they always fill up ur drink for you even though its actually a self serve lol.. I've never seen a Chinese buffet that has a staff that always smile at you and give you right away if you need something! This place is a must go if you want to pig out some Chinese food! ;)"}
{"text":"if i can give 0 star for this restaurant, i will definitely give 0. terrible food and service. Came here twice on a tour bus, the restaurant must have some kind of deal with the travel company. We got charged 15 bucks for trash food, and i am not saying panda express bad, it's like end of the world bad. If you ever have a choice, don't even come close to this place."}
{"text":"Good value. Second visit. Group stop. Food to and fresh. Better when 1st open. Decent variety but for classic Chinese vs American Chinese buffet. Service good. Prompt cleanup. Clean newer restaurant. 3.75 stars based on my second rating.  This one is a 4 today. Visit if you prefer this food."}
{"text":"It sucks. It's not worthy to spent $15 on this terrible restaurant.The foods are so terrible and the Chinese are everywhere, they cut in lines, speak out loud, it was a worst experience"}
{"text":"Driving by and noticed a huge new sign \"Las Vegas Buffet\" so had to check it out.  Went to Check-in but surprised to find it didn't exist in Yelp!  I'm quite skeptical when it comes to Asian buffets but I was so impressed, I immediately added this business to Yelp for others to enjoy.  They've really raised the bar for a local buffet.  Awesome variety, authentic Chinese dishes, and some of the most friendly staff you can find (which surprised me since they're not really working for tips).  To top it off, it's one of the most clean and well decorated restaurants in the area. Say what you will about this piece of information but I always know the food's going to be great when I'm the only white guy in a packed place!"}
