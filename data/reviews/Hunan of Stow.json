{"text":"We have Hunan of Stow delivered to our home at least twice monthly! Food is consistent and yummy. House special fried rice is amazing!"}
{"text":"I actually like Hunan of Stow pretty well. I love that I can order online and that the online ordering process is so customizable -- there are options on there that I never would have thought existed. You can customize your level of spice for each dish, type in a note about a special request or add extras. The only real qualm I have about this place is that they really don't have a ton of consistency. We have been ordering from here fairly regularly for a few months now, and sometimes my usual Chicken Fried Rice is perfect, well-spiced (kind of seems like they use ginger or something to flavor the rice, which is great) and perfect. Other times it's too dry and tastes like nothing. They also don't have bean sprouts at all, which is a pet peeve of mine. I also really love their garlic chicken, which I get medium spicy, and traditionally that dish has been waaaay too spicy for me at other places. For Boyfriend, who likes more spice than I do, he can get the spicy version and be just as happy. We have also learned that if you order the sauce on the side, you can stretch your dish even further, as they give you a TON of sauce on the side. When I order with Boyfriend, though, we typically put in a huge order to hold us over for a few days, and they never offer anything free like many other places do (no free pop, entree, appetizer, anything). So that's a little bit annoying as well. So it's one of my favorites for Chinese food delivery, but I still haven't really found anything that adds up to the flavor and consistency of what I'm used to in big cities. But.. I don't know that I expect to, as that's kind of unreasonable."}
{"text":"It's not the greatest Chinese, but so far for this area it's one of the better offerings I've found.  Years ago I visited a restaurant of the same name on Graham Rd.  I'm trying to figure out if it's the same people.  Regardless, I've enjoyed every entree, every appetizer, but just not a fan of yellow rice for fried rice...otherwise it's ok!"}
{"text":"Hunan of Stew (as the charge will appear on your credit card) is your typical \"fast food\" Chinese place. The meats come out a little rubbery and the broccoli and rice aren't completely cooked.  There's technically seating but nobody eats here. Newspapers and magazines are there to keep you occupied if you get there before your food is ready.  It's not great but none of the options in the immediate vicinity are. If you're in one of the hotels and you want something fast and filling, it's better than McDonald's. If you want to eat back in your room or have it delivered, this is your only option. If you want to watch TV or grab a beer, head to Brubaker's or TGI Friday."}
{"text":"Not good. Ordered two entrees and ended up disappointed in both. Very cheap and cheap tasting. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I should mention, delivery is a $10 min for those who live in the area. Here is a link to their menu. So far, it's current. http://www.allmenus.com/oh/stow/255620-hunan-of-stow/menu/"}
{"text":"Update: we tried to call and  place another order today as before and were told by a woman that answered that they are not able to accommodate a vegetarian order and replace the meat as they did before. Extremely disappointed in the lack of consistent service. It was not a problem the first time we ordered and it has never been an issue to replace meat with tofu at other chimese restaurants so you guys lost out an a regular costumer.   We ordered takeout and loved everything we got. They accommodated our requests so everything was vegetarian and tasted delicious. Highly recommend the pad thai and pad sew ew. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Been there twice, been disapointed twice. Last time I ordered General Tso's Chicken but they have a different idea of what 'chicken' is than I do. Every chunk of 'chicken' I cut into looked like a wad of skin and some kind of foreign substaince I could not identify. I could not eat any of it and was totally grossed out. My wife warned me not to try it a second time but I thought 'you can't mees up Chineese food!'. But boy was I wrong and how right she was."}
{"text":"You can order online, which to me, is worth 3 stars alone.    Food is typical Chinese fare, and prices are reasonable.  Delivery is average time, but the fellow that always brings me my food is pleasant and polite.  You're not getting a 5 star meal, but if you wanted that, you'd not order delivery Chinese..."}
{"text":"The place is filthy.  Everything is covered in filth and the restroom has clearly NEVER been cleaned.  I can only imagine what the back of the kitchen looks like.  The food was terrible.  The sauce for the general tso and sesame chicken was HOT KETCHUP mixed with a little honey.  All you could taste was HOT KETCHUP.  Tasted hot ketchup the remainder of the day.  Really gross."}
{"text":"many of the Chicken dishes have leg and thigh meat - BEWARE!   not that great."}
{"text":"I could eat this stuff until my face falls off.  +1 for Hunan of Stow!"}
{"text":"Typical Chinese restaurant. Cheap, quick, decent quality. Very much like every other Chinese restaurant I've been too.  Not as bad as some of the reviews I read on here."}
