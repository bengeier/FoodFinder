{"text":"My only complaint is the line!  I'm not a snow cone kind of person, but these are no ordinary snow cones.  You have to try it to understand. I recommend getting the cone in a cup a size bigger than what you ordered, particularly for kids- it helps avoid the mess."}
{"text":"This place used to be good until recently the past few times I've been here the snow cone has been extra iced. I won't spend my money here anymore or recommend anyone going here ."}
{"text":"Love this place. I am not a snow cone fan, but is far superior to  the other trailers in the neighborhood. selling snow cones.  It is all about the ice and syrup. They even have sugar free, The line can be long but goes quickly. The kids who work there are all friendly, energetic, and helpful. One kid Garrett is so cool you would think he has been in business for 20 years."}
{"text":"We love purple penguin. Best snow cone place with amazing flavors and ice cream! 
I usually get a medium Tigers blood and blue raspberry with ice cream. My boyfriend got a medium mango and coconut with ice cream this time. Both are amazingly delicious!! And the bottom is the best part when you reach the ice cream. Omg a must go place for snow cones/shaved ice."}
{"text":"This IS NOT shaved ice!  This is a regular outing for our family during summer.  When this closes in the end of September, it is a very sad time."}
{"text":"Best snow-cones. 
All in the texture. 
Price is really good compared to others also."}
{"text":"well i am going around to try different places and this is one of them on the list, it was OK, i dont care for the pieces of ice that are this size more like an old fashioned snow cone from the ice cream man growing up, way to big in my opinion, flavors were like all the others but the service was very good and the following on this place is better than others ive seen i believe, id go again, but not out of my way to go here. Nonetheless pretty cool little shack i suppose!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Purple Penguin and I am hooked! This was undoubtedly the best snow cone I have ever had! The have a huge selection of flavors to choose from and you can mix and match. I picked Blue Raspberry and Cherry and my husband had Banana and Cherry. Next time I will get all Banana it was so tasty. The ice is so soft and fluffy, no ice crystals. It is like perfectly fallen snow. The small is only $2 and it was plenty for me since it is very sweet. Totally worth the wait, don't give up if there is a line. We waited over 20 min and I would do it again and again! They say they close at 8p, but we got there at 7:50p and there were about 20 people ahead of us in line and by 8:20, still that many in line behind us - so I guess they keep serving past the \"closing\" time. If you like snow cones, or even if you don't, try it and you will love it!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time going this week to the Purple Penguin on Cactus in Southern Highlands.. I have to say I probably wont be back.I love the snow cones but the guy that took our order was so filthy I wanted to choke! His nails were black with dirt under them. His shirt was dirty and he asked us at least 3 times the same questions about our order. I'm sure he was on something. He had holes in his ears the size of my thumb .Just overall disgusting. I watched to make sure he didn't make our order Or I would have asked for my money back ! Thank god the young lady that was there made it. I have been in food and beverage business for many years and there is no way I would ever hire anyone to serve my food or drinks that looked like that ! If you want to keep your customers I would suggest he cleans up his act! Like I said I wont be back ..too bad I really liked the snow cones.."}
{"text":"Purple penguin snow cones are amazing. I don't know how they get the snow so fluffy, its awesome. I made so many trips within a week to determine which flavors are my favorite. No fails for me are black cherry, mango and blue raspberry and of course with ice cream."}
{"text":"This place was AWFUL. Because of two reasons 

1. The ice was DRY AND THERE WAS NO SYRUP. And inside of the ice, it tasted like I ordered a plain (no flavor) snow cone.

2. The customer service was terrible we ordered our items first, but somehow the customers behind us got their orders first like...WTF. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN, 

EDIT: I find it funny how someone assumes, I'm promoting another business just because I gave my HONEST OPINION which happens to praise another business in my review. Not bashing the kids that work there, but the snowcones were terrible. 

The fact that I didn't ask for a refund and let them keep my money for those terrible snowcones I paid for (which I promptly threw away) shows my humility and blind support for the business.

Oh and btw, there's only been 1 five star review for this place in the last 9 months (coincidence? I think not).... but let me guess, you think the competitors are somehow taking down all the good reviews as well? Sad indeed."}
{"text":"Bre helped us out so well she took care of my while group with ease she was Friendly and Give me a positive feel"}
{"text":"'O' no, I've heard of this type of place before, shaved ice with flavored syrup.

I'm no shaved ice connoisseur but the texture of the ice is what differentiates these places from one another. Purp Penguin's ice has the texture of mini ice chips which has a rough texture. I prefer the ice that is smooth in your mouth somewhat feels like ice cream. They call this a snowcone shack but where is the cone? The ice is served in a Styrofoam cup which I guess is appropriate for the \"Shack\" theme. 

I heard lines get pretty long here but I've had better. If you park Sno Ono beside the shack, Sno Ono would probably have the longer line."}
{"text":"These frozen treats are AMAZING! It is the ice! The ice is not crunchy or granular at all it is smooth and perfect...no comparison to a regular sno cone or a hawaiian shave ice...its much better!!! I mean zillions and trillions times better!! I try and have one every day because they are that GOOD! The flavors are amazing too. My favorite way is with a scoop of ice cream on the bottom and sometimes cream on the top....its delicious!
They are only here 6 months so get while the getting is good!! You will love it!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff.  Awesome snack on these hot days especially for the kids.  I only dropped a start because they are a little heavy with the syrup.  The kids surely don't mind but I prefer a better ice / syrup ratio."}
{"text":"I love this snowcone shack! Everytime I come here, I can try a new combonation of flavors or stick to my favorite (strawberry & blue raspberry). The staff is polite and courteous. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I would give it five stars if they had shade for the line and someplace to sit.  Love love love the red velvet with ice cream."}
{"text":"Took the kids here on a recommendation. Waited in line for 45 minutes. Snow cones were inhaled by the kids. The service was very friendly. For a unique treat, add cream to your flavor. Overall, it was really good but would not wait 45 minutes again."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! We travel across town just to go to The Shack for our dessert. My favorite is the Black Cherry with cream AND ice cream. The kids usually go crazy with blue bubblegum/rootbeer mixes. And my husband usually goes Black Cherry with cream. Great place with reasonable prices and umbrellas to keep you out of the sun while you wait in line (which does get longer every year)."}
{"text":"This isn't your typical snow cone place when you think of snow cones your usually think about that hard ice you have to bite into and so little flavors well this is different I don't know what they do to the ice but it's so soft and the flavors you can think of are endless I try to get this at least twice a week and it's a life saver during those hot summer nights"}
{"text":"Usually love going here but customer service is going way down hill today I waited and after the woman at the counter that let three different people who don't understand what a line is in front of us couldn't care less that I was mildly agitated trying to be nice she couldn't care less"}
{"text":"just came from here and the top of my \"snowcone\" was flat instead of the usual pointed top? also they should've given me a straw there's so much flavoring in it i could just drink it instead."}
{"text":"Excellent ice texture and flavors, but the condensed milk is not quite right.  It was thin and runny.  Can't figure out if it is a cheap brand or watered down.  In New Orleans they use Eagle Brand condensed milk and it is excellent!"}
{"text":"The PP is the closest 5 star establishment to my house bar none
But for some reason I had a strong dislike for 
The small penguin stack posted up at the gas station 
Ive pasted by it hundreds of times with a scowl... Why

Maybe it was the thousands of people who flock to
It like wild animals at a watering hole on the Serengeti 

Maybe I can't stand that the average age of the cliental 
Is 15 

Or maybe just maybe I can't stand to wait in line
For anything 

But this year the penguin was brought to 
Me unexpectedly so I had to try it

Let just say I will be one of those fat hippos at the watering hole 
This summer"}
{"text":"Not a fan of shaved ice at all, but when 114 degree weather comes you'll do anything to cool off. 

This place is just buzzing with people on those really hot days. You see people kickin' it in the back of their cars chomping away on their flavored ice. 

They have some really odd flavors like \"Tigers Blood\" and the 3 flavors per snow cone without an extra charge, (much better that way if you ask me).

They are VERY generous with their serving sizes! I got a medium size for $4 and that was way too much for me. I was better off with the $2 small size. 

This place is nice, but like I said, I am not a shaved ice type of person."}
{"text":"The BEST snowcone you will ever have!! We have been frequenting PP for a few years now and we still LOVE it. If you have to wait, it is well worth it. I always get cotton candy and tigers blood and it always tastes the same, PERFECT! They do allow you to add Blue Bell ice cream to your snow cone and it makes it even better. Everyone that works there is super nice and friendly. The owner is one of the nicest guys you will meet and still slings the snow in the shack as well. Love this place!"}
{"text":"First visit on 8-25-11 really good snowcone/shaved ice whatever you wanna call it!!! a bit of a long line but hey it was refreshing!!!! Wanna go back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Long lines, long wait! The girl with the long side braid has a very poor attitude, we asked for the sizes and she had an attitude. We gave her the money and told her to keep the rest. She heard me say to keep the change but she made a smart remark back do you want your .75 back."}
{"text":"Good snow cones! Pretty decent pricing. You'll end up spending anywhere from $2.50-$5.00 on a Snowcone, but they're worth it in my opinion. I would not get a large or penguin size (extra large) because it's a lot!!! If you get a small or medium, you'll save a good amount of money and you'll get enough to enjoy. The lines are always long. You can ask for a stamp card and when you get 10 snow cones, you earn a free one. 
You can get up to 3 flavors and there are so many to choose from. I loveeee the watermelon and red velvet flavor with ice cream in the middle! It sounds weird but trust me on that one!"}
{"text":"I don't have enough nice things to say about Purple Penguin. We try to go in the middle of the week so the wait isn't as long but even when there is a line - it's totally worth it.

My favorite is the blue bubble gum. Oh wait... cherry and watermelon... nope... green apple?

Heck, I like them all and have been bugging my daughter to try the pickle juice but she's not been brave enough yet.

The service is always super friendly and this season they have umbrellas for people to use to shade themselves while waiting in the sun.

I will reiterate what others have mentioned... BRING CASH."}
{"text":"Finally got an early jump on The Penguin this year. Just redeemed my frequent buyer card for my free Large Snowcone.  The purple Penguin is snowballing (pun intended) in popularity. If you happen to drive by with little or no line, take every opportunity to seize that moment to grab your cone. Otherwise expect to wait in line a bit, but never fear the wait will payoff huge dividends. I expect The penguin to give away many large Snowcones this year as the faithful customers continue to redeem their cards.
Found my new flavor combo: Margarita/Mango"}
{"text":"Our first time at purple penguin last night and it was so delicious!! We were really impressed at how fine the snow is and the flavor stays all the way through the ice as you eat it. Definitely hooked now!"}
{"text":"Reading the poor reviews inspired me to write my own, genuine and truthful review. The kids at this shack are great! I recently tried a strawberry snow cone with ice cream and loved it! The texture and syrup amount was exactly what I expect from Purple Penguin from past years of being a customer, and the ice cream amount was worth the extra few cents. I found it very interesting that the poor reviews were promoting the same \"Bahama Bucks\" as a supierior business, and believe that the only reason that they rated this snow cone shack so low was to bring business to the other. Sound a little undercover to you? Sad that this is how other businesses promote themselves. There's no need to tear down high school kids. I'll keep supporting Purple Penguin as long as it keeps coming each summer! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!! I took my friend here for her b day she loved it she said she felt like she was 10 again. Yes there is a line and a bit of a wait but it's worth it. The taste of the shaved ice is worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"July, 2013. My daughter and I will drive to LV to get it EVERYTIME!...  I'm normally a big fan of \"shaved snow\" here in LA, but PPenguin's shaved ice can match it well!!  Definitely add the ice cream to your shave ice!! See you next month!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST IN TOWN! When I have family and friends visiting from other states, this is the first place I take them.. This place is genius! I love it and the people I take are blown away at how amazing it is! Sucks that they're only here for the season..Vegas is so hot it should be open all year round! LOL"}
{"text":"PPSS is back with a shiny new shack! Same flavorful snowcones! Same friendly & efficient service! ..and now they have 2 snowcone machines going plus additional staff.  So dont let the long lines fool ya...average wait time for us (from 50 people deep) is about 17 minutes."}
{"text":"My husband and I are frequent customers of purple penguin. We live so close to the horizon and mission hills location and we fell in love with the deliciousness of a snow cone and ice cream combined. Every time we have gone it's been a great experience. However, today 9/10 at 600pm we had an awful expierence. We always have a stamp card and we were buying 5 smalls and 1 large. We counted our stamp card before we arrived knowing we had a free large. We gave the card to the girl working and she said you don't have enough stamps, we then asked for the card back and she started arguing with us and wouldn't let us see. We insisted on seeing it and we counted and showed her. She then responded \"well I already stamped it\". She was VERY rude. We have had this issue in the past with our stamp cards, so we made sure- triple checked our stamp card! We asked for her name and she wouldn't even answer us. I asked her coworker and he said her name was Ray... Who knows if that's true. Customer service was absolutely awful. Because of this expierence we will no longer be going and definitely not referring any of our friends and family. Throughout the summer we have spent a lot of money at purple penguin and it's a shame that 1 rude employee changes the entire expierence, but it did.
Everyone else that works there has always been so outgoing and friendly. This is the only employee that has ever acted like this. We have had encounters with her before and she has never been friendly but this time she was just flat out rude......unacceptable."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed because I really wanted the guy with the bad review to be wrong.  I got the rootbeer and vanilla.  It tasted faintly like a rootbeer float, but all the syrup was at the bottom of the cup.  There were several times I got huge chunks of ice and all I could think about was the review saying that.  The small was 2 bucks with a 75 cent increase for ice cream at the bottom.  My daughter got the cotton candy and birthday cake.  The cotton candy overpowered the birthday cake, to the extent I could not taste the birthday cake.  I will say the cotton candy did taste like cotton candy and made me jealous I didn't get cotton candy instead of rootbeer.  She got ice cream at the bottom and it was really good.  It did not melt even though it was 110 outside.  I will give them another shot, but I will likely try some other sno shacks too."}
{"text":"My daughter loves Purple Penguin Snowcone Shack! Now that it's opened we're guaranteed to be going off and on all spring and summer. 

The lines can be long at times but they're pretty quick. They have punch cards, buy 9 and get 1 free! 
There are so many flavors to choose from. I like pineapple with coconut or wedding cake. My daughters go to is cherry and blue raspberry. They even have pickle juice flavor. 

Also, if you order a small they are willing to give you a bigger cup so it doesn't spill, a must with kiddos!
We especially like going during the weekdays when kids are still in school, no lines!"}
{"text":"this place was a real pain in the ass to find, so look for the speedee mart at the corner of the intersection.  it's a small purple truck near the gas station.  it's not hawaiian shaved ice, and its not your typical snow cone from the carnival.. but it's actually really delicious!  the snow is mainly fine with a few crystals of ice and the flavor (no plural, i only got one flavor ]: ) tastes like how it should (vanilla) without any extra sugar that other places have.  i got a small vanilla snow cone with CREAM (YUM YUM YUM!) on top for $2.50.  the size is alright, it is a small foam cup which was surprisingly more than enough for me.  the flavor was dispersed through the cup evenly so you never eat a plain spoonful of snow.  you can choose three flavors without getting charged extra but i didn't read that part until after i ordered.  getting cream or ice cream costs an extra few cents.  there is a charge for credit card, so bring cash!  standing outside in the sun while they made it kind of sucked but it was worth it for such a tasty treat.  this place is seasonal.. which is a shame because i love to eat snow cones/shaved ice year round!  anyways, this is a place that i would definitely come to again if i were ever in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is so far!! But worth the trip! I had sugarfree mango, strawberry and cream. I wish they would have a more central location then the extreme parts of the valley. Come to my hood! We're nice  Promise!"}
{"text":"They made nice small cups for my children.  I almost can never get the point across to people that I wAnt A very small portion because it's for children and they don't need overflowing sweets. But the young lady made it happen for me!!  Good variety of flavors. I like you can add up to three. If we are on that side of town again I would go back for a treat for my little ones."}
{"text":"This is the perfect cool down, tasty treat for a hot summer day (or night). It's in a gas station parking lot. Just look for something purple. The lines aren't usually too terrible. And the staff are friendly and great about moving quickly.

There are numerous flavors to choose from, which always presents a challenge for me. Thankfully, you can choose up to 3 flavors, so you can create an endless number of flavor creations. The Tiger's Blood (strawberry and coconut) is delicious. I'm also a a big fan of the pink lemonade. This last trip, I did Tiger's Blood, pink lemonade, and cheesecake all in one. Cheesecake? Yep. It's tasty too. I also like the cherry and pink lemonade together. There's also birthday cake, wedding cake, mango, Red Bull, cotton candy, and the list goes on... 

And you choose to add ice cream to the bottom or not. I'm kinda meh on the ice cream. But I must admit that it's nice to have a more solid, frozen substance at the bottom to soak up all the melting liquid from the shaved ice. So you essentially get some ice cream flavored with whatever shaved ice you selected. And that's pretty handy.

You can also choose the less mess option and forgo the \"top\" (the cone shaped shaved ice that sticks out beyond the cup). You still get the same amount of shaved ice goodness - they just put it in a larger cup so you have less mess.

All in all, I'm a fan of this tasty dessert treat."}
{"text":"Imagine a steaming hot 115 degree day out driving around Henderson and all you want is to stop sweating because you air conditioning just isn't cutting it. Well, pop over to the Purple Penguin and ice your troubles away! 

Any flavor plus cream and you can't go wrong. My favorite is Tiger's Blood or Wedding Cake with cream of course. But if you can't decide just ask them for a sample. Don't forget your punch card so you can work up to that free one. 

I've tried the ice cream (with the cream...of course) and it didn't enhance my experience that much more so I haven't gotten it again. 

The small is always just the right amount for me, but the Mr. gets a medium...just a suggestion."}
{"text":"So worth any type of line (which hardly ever happens). Lots of flavor options & they will let you taste if you aren't sure"}
{"text":"This is the only place in town that has snow cones and these are New Orleans style also - which I think are the best! This place is in the shell gas station parking lot at the northwest corner of Horizon Ridge and Arroyo Grande. The prices are reasonable and are a great treat while it's 100+ degrees outside!"}
{"text":"I don't think you'll find a better snow cone place in town! I only wish they were open year-around!! The employees are so nice and they always smile. I love that they supply umbrella's for the killer heat in July and August. 

You will never be disappointed with an older but goodie...........sour apple :)"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! U have get the ice-cream in the bottom!! It's only 50cents extra!!! Very very worth it!!! Hurry because I heard this place closes every years winter time.. But not very sure in which date.."}
{"text":"We have been hearing about the Penguin for a year and just never went. Made our first stop on Saturday and went back today (Monday) for more. Good service and a nice soft snow cone. They have lots of flavors to choose from. I guess our VIP card will fill up fast if we stick to this every other day schedule!"}
{"text":"Yum! Another day in the desert heat, but today with a refreshing and tasty twist. I heard about The Purple Penguin sometime ago and couldn't wait to try it. Today my son and I had our chance and already are trying to figure out when we should make our way back! One vanilla ice cream topped with a triple flavor snow-cone: Sour Apple, TuttiFruitti & Bubblegum and one vanilla ice cream topped with a margarita flavored snow-cone with whip topping :D We Heart The Purple Penguin!"}
{"text":"First time visit today.  Had the watermelon with coconut and cream....so yummy!  If I had to explain the texture, I'd say it's between the texture of your typical snowcone ice and a slurpee.  The people were friendly.  Had to wait about 20 minutes but they had umbrellas for people to use.  I will definitely come back, especially in this Las Vegas 
heat!!!"}
{"text":"Purple Penguin is my favorite treat in the summer time. Always and forever will get the tigersblood with cream. There is nothing like it. I wish there was a whole store so I could get it year round but I guess that's how they are so popular because it's only available in the summer. I haven't tried their other flavors but I've gone with my boyfriend and he got the vanilla and cinnamon thinking it was like horchata and it was like hot tamales so that wasn't fun but overall I love it."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I am a nanny and the little girl I care for loves to go here for snowcones. Prices are not to bad either!! $2.25 for a small snowcone and it's only $1 to add ice cream. Staff is always friendly and willing to remake any mistake!! I highly recommend this place once the summer heat sets in!!!"}
{"text":"Tried purple penguin for the first time yesterday and I am hooked. Not your typical sno cone. The staff was friendly and was able to help me decide on what to try for my first time. The tiger blood was delicious (strawberry and coconut)."}
{"text":"Honestly I live for this place. I go often. Like too often lol. Thank you so much for your sugar free flavors. I would like to request SF wedding cake and root beer at the same time:)

Yes it might take awhile to get your snow cone but you can tell they are hand making them. So it's okay. Once the line starts moving it's efficient. I appreciate the good customer service we receive and honestly purple penguin makes the best snow cones I've ever had. Nothing compares!!!

I highly suggest purple penguin. Delicious options. Reasonably priced. And nice large portions."}
{"text":"The price is about the same as any other snow cone place I've been, BUT the snow come itself was AMAZING! I had no large ice chunks as can sometimes happen at other locations. You can also get blue bell ice cream in the center of your snow cone! The line wasn't too long when we arrived. Our wait for our snow cones was super short as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best snow cone I've had here in town. The only thing that keeps it from another star is the wait the usually comes with each visit. Good sign for the business, but it sucks in the middle of a summer day when the sun is beating down on you"}
{"text":"In Hawaii, having shave ice with the ice cream in the middle is a staple. Imagine my excitement when they start opening snowcone/shave ice shacks around the Vegas valley/Henderson. This place has become our favorite, and we've been visiting the Henderson location for a few Summers. This Summer they've began using BLUE BELL vanilla ice cream, making this sweet treat that much sweeter. The prices are affordable, the punch cards are helpful and if you're like us, you earn a free treat pretty quickly.  I always opt for the same flavors: banana, strawberry and pina colada. However, between the kids and the husband, we've tried almost every flavor on the menu, including their flavor specials. Every flavor has tasted great, and the ice is saturated with the syrup flavoring, avoiding that bare ice sad part of snowcones which sometimes occurs. Melt in your mouth ice, delightful flavors, and always friendly employees.


COOL! (literally!)"}
{"text":"I can't believe alloif these good reviews. Have u guys never had Shave Ice before?    This was horrible. There was 6 of us total. All different flavors. They put lots of syrup on it but their syrup is too watered down. I couldn't taste anything but ice. I am glad I paid extra for the vanilla ice cream in the bottom or it would of been a complete waste. The ice is shaved nicely but no flavor.  I mean nothing. Also they are real slow."}
{"text":"The best way to cool down from the desert heat is to pay a visit to this little spot for some snow cones! Situated at the gas station, this little spot serves a multitude of syrups including some sugar free options! You have your basic flavors like strawberry and blue raspberry, as well as tiger's blood, and even more fun flavors like birthday cake! It's not Hawaiian shaved ice, it is a snow cone so don't expect the ice to be fluffy. 

If eating in the car, I suggest asking to put your order in a larger cup to prevent spills. The price, variety of flavors, and cooling treat is worth a visit if you're around the area."}
{"text":"Ooohhhh this place is delicious, perfect for a hot day!!!! It is a small little truck parked on the side of a gas station and luckily when we were there, there was no line at all! From what I hear, sometimes the line turns around the corner too!

Upon walking up or even driving by, you'll see this purple truck with a penguin on it. The menu is placed on the side and the girls working are extremely nice- you can try different flavors and ask for recommendations as well! What makes it great is they can put vanilla ice cream on the bottom and you can even top it off with cream!

If you've ever had bahama bucks, this is pretty similar to it!!! I noticed that when my friend got the tiger's blood with cream and ice cream, the consistency of her ice was a more creamy consistency. I only got the pickle juice (not as salty as I hoped for but still good) with tamarind without cream or ice cream and it was more of an ice than a creamy consistency. The ice is crushed but not as fine as snow. Still delicious either way!

All in all, I'm coming back when I'm on this side of town and I'll be trying out different flavors!"}
{"text":"Please bring back Purple Penguin soon! It's the best place to get snow cones, even on an uncomfortably hot summer day. I always get the blue raspberry snow cone every time I go here, and they give you a card where if you buy nine snow cones, you get the tenth one free.
I can't wait till it returns this summer! It's always worth the wait once it comes back."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here for the best SHAVED ice in town. The lines aren't bad at all and the customer service has always been great. The shaved ice is so soft and they have a ton of flavors to choose from. We are so sad they are closing for the season."}
{"text":"Still awesome!  Love the variety of flavors and just recently got ice cream with root beer, yum! I don't know what brand of ice cream they use but it's the best vanilla I ever had. Even my boys said the same thing! I make the long trek down here for my boys and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Location is good. Product is good for price and perfect for desert wait. Wait time is ridiculous, and I don't mean to get the shaved Ice. I expect delay there. 
Having my kids blatantly ignored for several minutes then myself for an additional several when its 114, only to receive attitude when I knock on window and ask if they are open of not is infuriating and likely the reason Ill look for another location before before returning."}
{"text":"Satisfies the snowcone craving but more like flavored ice chips. Reasonably priced and good serving sizes but would rather have shaved ice."}
{"text":"I have heard of this place and finally got there yesterday. WOW!! I LOVE IT!! It was in the nineties and needed  a refresher. Had the rootbeer and pina colada with ice cream. My friend had the grape and watermelon with ice cream. The grape was pretty sweet BUT it did not get thrown away. HA! Want to go back SOON."}
{"text":"The best shaved ice in all of Vegas!! This is no ordinary shaved ice. It is melt in your mouth, day-changing goodness. Expect a 20 minute wait in the summer, so make friends with the other sweaty people in line. The best times to go are between 12-2:30 (when the teens are all still in school) and right around dinner time, when parents are feeding their kids dinner. That's when you will find the shortest lines! Also, I just adore the owner. Back in the day (2 years ago) a friend would go a lot around lunch time and he was always working. He's a really friendly guy, who had an entrepreneurial dream and has made a GREAT Las Vegas staple. Purple Penguin is the only way to survive the Vegas summer!"}
{"text":"Very cute little place! The icees they serve are super yummy! Perfect on these hot Vegas days."}
{"text":"Number spot in Vegas when it comes down to snow cones! Was there Thursday afternoon and I was amazed with the customer service this young lady gave me. I'll definitely be back with family."}
{"text":"Neighborhood Snow Cone Shack !!  It can be a long wait but well worth the it !!"}
{"text":"Sometimes my cravings are my worst enemy... But today, they helped me find a wonderful gem! Sitting y the pool trying to handle this insane Vegas heat, I turned to my best friend and said \"Italian ice.... I need it. Now.\" So instantly she turned to yelp and we decided to give this place a try. 

Don't be deceived when you first pull up. Google maps will take you to a gas station... Instead of yelling at your phone, just accept it because your phone is correct. This place is a little truck type thing on the side of the gas station. 

After getting un-confused by the location I was excited to finally satisfy my craving. I thought it was awesome that they have so many flavors!! I am quite an indecisive person, but I still appreciated the multitude of options. I decided to get three flavors: blue raspberry, guava, and mango. Each flavor was as delicious as the next! And it looked pretty too. Although this place calls itself \"purple penguin snow cones\" it is definitely the closest I've had to a legitimate Italian ice in quite a while. 

Needless to say, I'll be going back and testing out all the other flavors on their extensive list! I'm pretty sure purple penguins are my new favorite animal!"}
{"text":"I love how they offer a bigger cup so I don't have to have the mound of ice on top. The ice is super fine, not chunky like other places. I went the last Saturday of this season, and mine had so much plastic in it (from the ice bag maybe) that I couldn't eat it. I know mistakes happen and all other visits have been great so they still get my 5 stars. Bummed my last one of the season was ruined though :("}
{"text":"A winning business model with a superior product, PPSC is an obvious winner during the hot days in Vegas. Fuffy-soft sno-cones come in all kinds of flavors, including Tiger's Blood (fruit punch with coconut). A scoop of ice cream at the bottom can be a nice variation in any of their four sizes and I happily paid the 50 cent fee for swiping my card.

There is a place just like this called Jerry's Sno Cones in Memphis, TN, so I obviously couldn't pass up an opportunity to check out PPSC on a recent trip to Vegas. If you are in the area for fun, make it a sweet double-feature with a tour/tasting at Ella M Chocolates too. Happiness in a styrofoam cup!"}
{"text":"Very cute little shop with great service and yummy refreshing treats. We always love when we can find somewhere with vegan options and the Simple Snow Triple Berry did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with shaved ice, so I decided to give it four stars. Maybe once I try a few other places, it might get bumped down, who knows?

I still have to try Frost Bites Shavery, since Lon L. says it's the best! But I have yet to make it over there, and this place is so close to my new residence. So it is more convenience than anything at this point.

But that does not take away how yummy my experiences with the Purple Penguin have been so far. I had not had a snowcone in years, so walking up to the stand had me a little nervous. I had no idea what to order, or what would taste good.

The girl at the window was very helpful, answering all my questions, such as, \"Cream?..... What is this 'cream' stuff you put on it?\" In the end, I decided to order the medium size, Tiger's Blood flavor, with cream AND ice cream.

That shiz was so amaze-balls, especially on a hot Las Vegas summer day! And the flavor suggestion was on point!! Tiger's Blood ftw :) Despite the odd name, it's the first one I tried, and now I think I will be getting it every time hereafter.

The next day, I was back. This time, I had Tiger's Blood and Pineapple, half-and-half. Still amaze-balls. 

The cool thing is they have a punch card program, where any size gets you a stamp. After nine, the tenth (any size) is free! And if you have your handy-dandy Yelp App ready, you get a free stamp with check-in. That alone is a pretty darn good reason to come here.

Side Note: They use \"Square\" here, so don't be afraid if you are low on cash money and have to use a card. A little bummed about the fact that they charge you an extra 50 cents to use it, but it is nice they have it I guess."}
{"text":"I love this place! Friendly staff! Amazing flavors of snowcones. The service here is stellar!  Super upbeat  and friendly environment. This is the biggest part of my reason for the five star rating!!  And I lovvvvvvveeeee the texture of their snow! Purple Penguin is one of the best, if not the BEST, snowcone spots in Las Vegas/Henderson. Whenever I am in the area I always make my way to this place. Try the Tigers Blood...it's fabulous!!!! I wish it was open all year long! I am obsessed!!!  :)"}
{"text":"What a cool random place to find deep in Henderson.  It's right outside of Speedy Mart- and when the weather gets hot, I will definitely be back.  They have all kinds of flavors that you can mix and match.  The wait time was a little long, but it was worth the wait.  
Check this place out this summer!"}
{"text":"Gotta bump it down a star...

I wanted Shave Ice the past Sunday because I have been craving for it ever since we left Maui some days ago.  However, Purple penguin did not satisfy me one bit.

First, they gave me the wrong flavor.  I asked for Tiger's blood, leche, and mango.  The order taker wrote down TB/LE/MA.

When I got my cup of ice, it became Tiger's blood, pink lemonade, and mango.  So, we had to wait for them to redo it.  Was it worth it...Heck No!

It's as if they had preshaved the ice and just scoop it into a cup as it is ordered.  There were chunks of ice.

No bueno.  Not returning, ever again.  Why?  There are much better shave ice shacks out here in my area.  Just had Beach Bums today and is more of the Hawaiian shave ice consistency that I was looking for."}
{"text":"LOVE the mango flavored snowcone. I get cream on top and it's sooo good. The ice is soft, and the mango flavor is amazing. Sometimes they don't put enough cream, and they charge extra so it's nice when they put alot since you're paying for it. Also, the lines are super long and during the summer it sucks. BUT I will def continue to go because I love it. PS get a stamp card! buy 9-10(not sure exactly) and get one free :)

Oh yeah, and the people working there are always very friendly."}
{"text":"10 stars! It's sooo smooth and powdery shaved ice! They pack the ice firmly and smoother it with flavors! My favorites are COTTON CANDY and BLUE BUBBLEGUM followed by, banana, pina colada and watermelon. Sooooo good! I go during weeknights so I don't have to wait 30 mins in line."}
{"text":"Purple Penguin is the best place to grab a treat in the desert, hands down. All kinds of concoctions are possible which leaves so much to the imagination. Lines can get a little long in 115+ degree temps but it is sooo worth it! If I could give 10 stars I would.....You need to visit this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"This little shack is definitely a gem in the desert of Henderson. Anyone who has lived here for over a year knows how hot the Las Vegas sun can get, and these snow cones offer the perfect relief. 

There have to be at least 30+ flavors to choose from and you are able to choose up to three flavors on each cone without any extra charge. They have some of the normal flavorings you'd expect to see, like orange and blue raspberry, as well as some for the more adventurous out there, like pickle juice and Tiger's Blood. There are also sugar-free options available, but they are changed every week and announced via their Facebook page. For a few extra quarters, you can also choose to add a scoop of ice cream or some cream drizzled on top. The sizes are also in very generous portions with plenty of snow stacked on top.

The staff is always friendly and makes it an overall enjoyable outing. If you live in the area, it's also worth it to pick up one of their punch cards. It isn't open all year around, but that just allows you to savor the experience."}
{"text":"When I think of snowcone, I think of that rainbow ice treat that you get from an icecream truck. You know, the typical paper cone cup with a mound of rounded ice which is literally just coarsely blended ice doused in sugary syrups. 

Purple Penguin was a shocker for me. 

I have never had a snowcone more moist and snow-like. 
My boyfriend swears by that place & knew just the place when I stated my cravings. 

Best part of this place is that they served Fuzzy Naval flavored snow cones. UH-MAAAZING!"}
{"text":"YES!  I'll be back....

The first time I saw a line at this place was on tax day and I just thought they were giving out free stuff...then the next day, same thing and the day after - again. And then the following week, the same thing.
So now I was definitely curious and needed to find out what the hype was over this Purple Shack at the Shell gas station. 

Needless to say, I checked Yelp to see if there was any info and behold my curiosity just grew tenfold.  I needed one of these!
I had errands to run this afternoon, and since the post office is down the street I made up my mind that I was going to make the jump...

And yes, there was a line, but not as long as other times, so I went and stood and waited all by my lonesome.  I have to admit, there were about three times that I contemplated leaving and just coming back at night when the sun wasn't pounding down (it was definitely hot) but I was so close...I decided to wait it out.
Ordered me a small cheesecake ($2) with ice cream ($.75)

I watched as all the colorful orders came out before mine and then my turn.  Such a sad looking snowcone - there was absolutely no color and looked like a cup full of ice..I wondered if I made the wrong choice in flavor.
I was so wrong!  The flavor oozed through with each lick and spoonful.  The ice is so soft and the small was good enough for both me and my hubby who I shared with once I got home.  Our two other roommates just had to listen to us enjoy this wonderful treat...LOL.  

I'll definitely be back tonight and this time with three more curious souls.  :)
I'm so glad they are just down the street from us and not across town.  Never thought I'd ever be in love with a snowcone!"}
{"text":"My kids love PP.   We go there a couple times a month (or more) in the summer. The lines are usually long, but the snow cones are worth it. Their shaved ice and flavored syrups are better than other shaved ice places.
They have a small, mobile stand in the parking lot of a gas station, more shade offered would be great, but it's Hot Vegas, so you know, nothing you can do about the weather."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this. I have had better elsewhere. It's just a corned shaved ice shack. Nothing to brag about. Ice and sugar syrup. I can make these myself lol. Went once won't ever go again. I found a way better spot!"}
{"text":"Purple Penguin is one of the best ways to cool off on a hot summer day in Henderson. You'll find Purple Penguin in a gas station parking lot at Horizon Ridge and Arroyo Grande. It's a small stand with a lot of options and usually a long line.

The flavor options here are almost endless. The hardest part is narrowing down the options. Fortunately, you can choose two or three options for one snowcone. I like the Fuzzy Navel or Amaretto. Yum! Everyone in the family will find a flavor or three that they can enjoy. Pricing is reasonable for an icy treat and the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"I came here when it was 110 outside. I wait online. All I had was a $100 bill and plenty of credit cards. The girl tells me they can't change the hundred so I said well since you can't change the hundred can you at least take a credit card and she said yes but they charge a  40 cent fee. Does that make good business or moral sense?  if you can do your job and change the money in your business, you're going to bill me extra ? It was a $5 transaction. What do they pay the credit card company 3% or $0.15 for my order? They can't eat the $0.15 for a loyal customer rather than inconvenience him? That's just dumb. I mean after all they're selling frozen water for $2.50 a cup and they can't eat $0.15 for the convenience of a customer who stood out of the heat for 10 minutes? Don't like people who don't conduct business fairly. Done with this place."}
{"text":"Fast service, the flavors are great. We cant pass this after sports and not stop. A great neighborhood snack !"}
{"text":"Amazing every year we come here. Stay open all year pretty please. Great customer service and delicious for everyone. Get it with ice cream that's the best"}
{"text":"Passed this place quite a few times - always a line. Have been trying to convince the hubby to join me for a late evening snack. Glad we didn't go too late as they close at 8, though we arrived a few minutes before and the line continued to grow behind us. I had the coconut mango with a .25 upcharge for cream. You can add ice cream for .50. It was yummy, smooth, cold and just sweet enough. Will return and wait in line for their treats. $2 small $2.50 medium $3 large Small is big!"}
{"text":"I am a real regular here! I know all the employees and they know my name and order by heart! I get at least one large or penguin size every day! My favorite is coconut and vanilla, which sounds weird but it's AMAZING! 
Thank God for this truck! It puts a smile on my face and gives me something to look forward to each afternoon :)
Great employees, great favors and generous portions for the price! Just Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"It's so Hot and humid outside we decided to finally come here. Totally hit the spot! Get the Tigers blood with ice cream on the bottom! Amazing"}
{"text":"Super yummy snow cones in my neighborhood....and I happened to go on the last day they are open until April!

Lots of flavor choices, plus you can add cream (condensed milk) or ice cream.

Small, medium, large, all under $3.50!  I got a medium coconut-margarita-daquiri with cream and it was sooo yummy.  The service was excellent too!!!!  A fun place!"}
{"text":"Super awesome place to go during these hot Las Vegas summers! I wish they were available in other locations! It's cheap, it's not high in calories (it's just literally ice and flavoring), but yet it is so refreshing! Sometimes you don't want a heavy cream-based cold dessert, you just want one to quench your thirst and cool you down. What I especially like about their shaved ice is that it they have so many different flavors and also, most importantly, their ice is shaved really fine."}
{"text":"We came to Purple Penguin at the advice of a bunch of friends from church. We happened to be in the area, and in need of dessert so we stopped at the snow cone shack. I had already prepared myself mentally for the possibility of a wait, and there was definitely a wait- nearly 40 minutes! This is one of the reason that I didn't give it 5 stars. We had the kiddos with us, and the got pretty restless. HOWEVER- I will say that it was absolutely worth the wait! The Purple Penguin has a great selection of off-the-wall flavors like mojito, fuzzy navel, pickle juice and red velvet cake. The also provide a sugar-free selection for the sugar conscience residents here in the valley. The \"snow\" is actually produced by a snow-ball machine, and it super smooth. None of the crunchy ice you get at a typical snow cone stand! You can combine flavors and even top off your snow cone with cream or ICE CREAM! I went with the sugar free red-velvet, and topped the medium sized snow cone off with cream. It was heaven on ice! Much Love to the Purple Penguin. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"we decided to see what al the hubbub was about with shaved ice. I have never had it before.

We took the kids of course, they will never say no to dessert. 

First thing we noticed was the long line. Always a good sign.

The menu board was HUGE so many choices. Really funky ones too like pickle juice.

I had the tiger's blood with a scoop of vanilla which was very good. The snowcone itself was very sweet. I liked the texture though. 

The kids enjoyed everything and had sticky hands, blue and red tongues, and huge smiles.

Its a great value too, $2 for a small which is plenty. I don't know how someone can eat one of the huge ones without it melting all over and making a mess."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I have only had Snowcone a as good once before, when I lived in Oregon. I get the tigers blood with ice cream and it's sooooo delicious. We bring all our friends here when they come to our house. (:"}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been to a number of snowcone shacks and this place has the softest ice and greatest flavor. 

I had a medium sour apple and birthday cake combo snowcone. It was very very good I didn't want to share with anyone. 

They do charge 50 cents to use credit card though. And I wish they had a tree for some shade and some chairs with tables- but it is just where the gas station is."}
{"text":"I'm honestly SO sad that this place has such great reviews cause I was really disappointed! I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. I was really surprised to see that Purple Penguin was literally a purple shack. This place is cheap but you do have to remember all you are getting is ice and sugar. I ordered a medium ($3) and got pineapple, coconut, and mango and was really disappointed! I couldn't even tell the difference between the mango and pineapple  Sorry Purple Penguin but this Asian penguin won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Their frozen ice is the best. You MUST try it with ice cream because it makes it 100x better. There's so many flavors to choose from and you can get up 3 different flavors. It's also so cheap for this flavory goodness. A small is only $2 (2.74 w/ ice cream) and the other sizes are just as cheap. If you don't have cash you can use a card they just charge you 50 cents more which to me isn't a biggie. 

When I went this time there was a long wait as always. That's the only bad thing if you go during a busy hour (I went right after kids got out of school) you will have to wait at least a half hour. It'd be nice if they had more staff. But its so good that I will wait in line every time. I got strawberry, peach and mango with vanilla ice cream. So good and fruity-definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for a really long time and tonight I finally pulled the trigger. This was the first snow cone I've had in years and it was quite the tasty treat, however it did turn me into a little baby, holy cow I forgot how bad a brain freeze is! Long story short I would recommend giving this place a try"}
{"text":"OK, this is a great place to go.  I will be back for sure!  Just coming back from Hawaii and have the best \"ono\" shaved ice, I would say that this place in terms of taste and enjoyment is not shabby at all.

1.  Parking - This place is in a Shell station lot, so parking is what it is. Not a lot.

2.  Lines - The lines to get this stuff is long, and the process that they use to make it is not the most efficient, so the line is slow. Be prepared to wait and if it is very hot, well, you will have your wonderful shave ice soon.

3.  Service - All the staff is very nice. They will explain the odd flavors like Hurricane and the Pickle flavor.... Very odd, but hey,  you gotta try it.

4.  Price - Great pricing and all the right add on.

5.  Taste - Not bad at all. I like how they will pack the flavor into the first layer and then add more ice and add more flavor on top.  The process they use to make this, seems to have too many steps and too mechanical, which leads to longer time to make the shaved ice.  If they have practice, they can make it faster and get the line moving and increase sales for sure.

GK says check this place out. Unique, fun great tasting.  No where to sit, no where to stand, and yet the best things in life are not the things, so don't focus on what is not there.  You just get over there and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My buddy Wes has been raving about this place for a while.  I've never been a huge snowcone person so I didn't really see the big deal.  On the way home from a Beerfest we ended up stopping and I couldn't believe the line.  Not only was there a line but there were multiple couples that were dressed up for Prom.  And they were stopped at a snowcone shack?  Yes, they were!

This place is no joke and was one of the best, if not the best, snowcones I've ever had.  I can't quite remember the combination of flavors I got (see beerfest) but I know that the Tiger's Blood was in there somewhere.  There was just something about the flavor and the cream they used that made this snowcone amazing!  I'm glad I finally stopped in and even happier that I live less than 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"I am giving the purple penguin three stars for a couple of reasons. But first, we will start with the snow cones. I got a large black berry cheese cake snow cone with ice cream. 

My eyes were way bigger than my stomach and I didn't finish the entire thing, but it was delicious! I had a few larger ice chunks in my snow cone , which I wasn't expecting . Honestly it should be down to a science by now considering you have been open for how many years? Anyways I was with two other people and we waited in line forever

 I don't know exactly how their whole setup works but there were 3 people behind us that got their orders first. We ended up asking about it and the employee was kind of rude. I get it, you work in a snow cone shack but it's all about good customer service. I think that if our question had been answered in a different tone I would have given it 4 stars. Again the first star was deducted due to the line. 

With this being said pretty good snow cone. I'll go back next time a little earlier to avoid the teeny bopppers ;)"}
{"text":"I heard the good things about Purple Penguin, and I wondered how a snowcone could be that good, but it really was.  We went to Purple Penguin on a Monday about 12:30 or so.  They already had the \"velvet rope\" set up for the line, but there pretty much wasn't a line when we arrived.  2 people in front of us, we probably waited 5 minutes from the time we walked up to the window to when we got the snowcones.  I had a strawberry daiquiri.  I liked how they did the syrup, basically half and half instead of just all mixed together.  Also, the syrup completely permeated the entire snowcone.  I've eaten other snowcones were the top is mostly ice, but not this one.  The flavor was throughout and it was good.  The ice was shaved very fine, it had a slushy like consistency from the beginning.  I read the reviews about waiting a half hour for a snowcone.  I don't know that I would do that in the Vegas heat, but it certainly was an excellent snowcone and I can see why it's so popular.  We will return."}
{"text":"Lots of flavors to choose from! There were easy to find and tasted great. The 5 star is missing due to customer service. A smile Goes a long way..."}
{"text":"Kid that works there is great. They have something there to make everyone's snow cone the toot de la toot of snowcones. 

I got the $4 King of Cones (I just made that name up) = Large single flavored with Ice cream at the bottom. They have a small for like $2 which might have been plenty since the large was rather large.

BRING CASH!!! The chump gas station host doesn't do cash back so I had to use the ATM machine which cost me $2.99 on their end and $2 on my bank side. Nonetheless we still tipped the kid $4 for the cones because it was a great experience. I signed up for this yelp site just to tell everyone about it."}
{"text":"Last night my bf and I were driving over to costco and on our way home. He wanted to try this place called the purple penguin. Wowee the line for this place was super long. Long lines= delicious food. When it was finally our turn to order we had the cake batter, sour apple, and pineapple. The apple and pineapple were okay but the cake batter was so sweet and delicious. What a refreshing treat to end the night with! The snow that they made was not as fine as Snow Ono, which was still fine. After I would put a spoonful into my mouth, I would try to suck the syrup out and let the ice melt in my mouth. By the time I was finished I had total brain freeze. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  They have lots of flavor options and offer friendly service.  The lines tend to get really long, especially at obvious times like after school lets out on the weekdays.  We went on a Monday evening and, although the line wasn't that long, we waited FOR. EVER.  

They accept credit cards but they do charge to use them.  They have a punch card - 9 snow cones and get one free.  I like that they'll ask you if you have one or, if not, if you want one.  Some places don't even tell you about them... I haven't tried all the snowcone/ice places in the area, and Beach Bums  is a lot closer to me, so I'm not sure how soon I'll be back."}
{"text":"Extremely overrated. There is most of the time a ridiculously long line, and the prices are more expensive than other shacks.
They were the first ones in this part of town which is why they are so popular, and the creative name helps, but they deliver the same product other places do, and sometimes the other places are even better.
Plus their cream sucks.
If you drive past and see there is a huge ass line, keep driving down the street to horizon and green valley, and you'll find frost bite. Less crowded and in some ways even better."}
{"text":"Purple penguin is a little food truck/stand in front of the corner gas station. The workers were friendly and they have a large selection of flavors.

Positive: large portions for pretty good prices. They have 4 sizes and you can fill each with any combination of three flavors. I tried a combination of cherry and blue bubblegum and a separate pickle juice. 

Negative for me: the taste is pretty bland as it is just blended ice with flavoring. The pickle juice is sort of pickle juice only lighter on salt taste with a added sugary taste. I dumped both my cups after like 10% finished. Not too say it was bad but it wasn't quite the same as back east snow cones and maybe I just Haven't had them since I was a kid. 

Anyway if health concerns and calories are on your mind this is a nice treat for those hot days . But if not then I don't know why you would get some nice frozen yogurt , ice cream or some delicious gelato ."}
{"text":"Only downside of this place is the line but thats because it is well deserved since this place is so fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't eat snowcones. I probably haven't had one for over 5 years. When running errands all day in the heat and stopping to get gas at the gas station, we bit the bullet and grabbed one. I figured they must be good as their is always a line up.  They were definitely refreshing and good for cooling down. I don't have anything negative to say but I am just not a snow cone kind of guy. I can see where kids would love to get thesesnowcones on a regular basis during hot days. They had alot of flavor added and were not just a cup of ice."}
{"text":"Okay so when was the last time it was 114 degrees out and you were in your car wishing your AC was just a tad colder and you couldn't stop thinking that you would like an ice cold treat. Well take a drive down Horizon Ridge and it will be a like a mirage in the Sahara, no your eyes don't deceive you, that is a Smiling purple penguin and it looks like there is a line from sea world waiting to check it out. 

After hearing more than enough good things about this place I was beginning to think they gave out twenties with each purchase because these people talk about it like they are getting paid to advertise, and there is no way that this place is that good, come on it is shaved ice and sugar flavoring....Right.... Wrong!! It has to be one of the best cones of snow you have ever eaten, they have flavors from pina colada to red velvet even Horchata... 

Yes the parking is tough because it is at a gas station and the line is long but come on folks, we will wait in line for our dudes at the slider truck and why is that.... Because they are delicious and anything worth putting in your mouth is worth waiting for so why not wait in line for the penguin.

All in all I give two cones up to the PPSS.. see you next season buddy"}
{"text":"Awesome snow cones. I wasnt going to make to the  puprle penguin by my house in time so I stopped here and as expected  it was great. My favorite flavor combo is tigers blood and vanilla with cream! but you can't go wrong with any of their home made flavors as I have tried most of them."}
{"text":"I would give it five, but the wait!! Every time I go there I swear I won't come back, because of the 30min wait...but it is so worth it.
The prices are just right.
The flavors are great.
The service is nice.
I love my rewards card!
Time to but a faster bigger machine purple penguin dude!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to frequent this all the time during the summer.

They have tons of flavors to choose from and we usually get ours with ice cream!

Pretty cheap as well! It's a nice change from froyo and fraps."}
{"text":"Love this spot!! It's usually crowded when we go on Saturdays but it was hot and we just had a good workout so we decided to treat ourselves on a random Wednesday. First time we had been there without a line. 

The workers are always pleasant, no matter how hot and no matter the length of line or lack there of. These are the best snow cones we have had. 

I've tried the regular options as well as the real fruit options which I think are the most delicious, and the sugar free options. I like that they change up their sugar free options and have always had three SF options every time we've visited. 

Today I had SF tigers blood and SF pina colada which is also red. My husband had SF tigers blood and SF watermelon. Loved them both!  Can't wait to go back, next time we will have enough punches for a free snow cone!!"}
{"text":"It's hot, folks.  And kudos to the crew who are dishing out the snow cones at Purple Penguin.  Sure, they work with ice all day and maybe they have A/C in their little trailer, but it's still hot in hurr.

I ventured over to this location on my lunch break yesterday and ordered up a $3.50 medium cone with Tiger's Blood, banana, and blue raspberry.  I wanted a cone that was kinda rainbow-ish looking.  First I ordered mango, but the friendly staff member who took my order, Bree, said that mango wouldn't work too well and to get banana instead:  done.  There were a few people ahead of me sweltering in the heat at 1:00pm, mostly teens on summer break.  Unfortunately there is really no shade anywhere so you all just have to stand in the sun until your order is ready.  For a return visit, I'll go back when it's later in the day and the sun isn't beating right down on me.  On the other hand, the snow cone was refreshing and I liked the combo of coconut (from the Tiger's Blood) and banana flavors: quite tropical!  You can ask for a stamp card so that your 11th cone is free.  There are lots of other flavors and combinations to choose from so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave 0 Stars. Horrible customer service. Ordered 5 snow cones for family and every last one was HORRIBLE!!!! They seem like they are trying to save on syrup flavors....the ice is not shaved well and they are just tasteless. They served the people that came after us which is horrible customer service. Seemed very prejudice as well. Just awful...

Do yourself a favor and visit Bahama Bucks in North Las Vegas who are WAY BETTER!"}
{"text":"This is simple it is the perfect hot weather treat!! They have good tasting flavours and decent prices it's is a good alternative to ice cream although u can get it mixed in with your snow cone too!!"}
{"text":"We dont make it to this side of town too often but when we do we try to stop in for a quick snowcone snack.  We do like it better with the ice cream added to it but either way its still good."}
{"text":"I love this place because its simple, cheap, and delish. I love the variety of flavors they have. I go at least twice a week. 

I gave them 4 stars, because I prefer the snow cone place I go to in TX... but def my favorite in NV. :)"}
{"text":"I first had discovered Purple Penguin back in the day when I was in high school. It's a little truck in the corner of the gas station and it's such a hidden little purple gem of Henderson! They have some of the best shaved ice I've had in Vegas. It's soft. The flavors are really good. They don't shy away from making sure you know you're gonna get messy. And you can choose to add either cream or ice cream (or both) in it! Get the ice cream for sure! A small is definitely filling and you can always take your shaved ice to the park near by and enjoy it outside when the weather is nice. It's also something to cool you off in the summertime. If you haven't tried it you've got to stop by!"}
{"text":"I have been going to purple penguin since their first summer 5 years ago & still wont go anywhere else.  PP has the best ice, flavors, AND customer service. They exceed in beating your expectations with great flavor & overall customer experience. Hurricane with cream is the beat combination and I hope to see this shack around for many years to come!"}
