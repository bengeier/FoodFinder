This pizza is bomb diggity.

Went here for the first time tonight. The crust is that perfect matrix of chewy inside, crispy outside, homemade dough extravaganza. The meatballs were made by angels and whoever is responsible for making our pizzas tonight should automatically receive sainthood. 

You made our evening. I never want to stop eating this. There are pizza places much closer to our house, but we'll drive further just to eat this little slice of heaven. 

Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"We came in with a Groupon and sadly were told that even though the fine print had no exclusions, we could only order a pizza.  I was hoping to order a pizza and a calzone or hoagie and pay the difference.  But nope it was pizza only on weekends even though the place was empty and we were getting carryout. I did want want to argue with the abrupt person taking our order.
The pizza itself was quite good.  We ordered the pesto chicken. Without groupon I never would have known about this place which is quite close to Robinson Mall.  I no longer live in the Burg but come here often and would return .  But shucks, why wouldn't you let me get a calzone!  Incidently the 3 star rating is the average of 4 for the pizza and 2 for the service.  Never understand why a person in the restaurant business can't be pleasant and if you don't like Groupon then don't offer it."}
{"text":"I just found out that this place is closed.  I'm so sad.  I tried calling yesterday and the phone was disconnected.  Horrible news."}
