{"text":"Amazing Amazing persian Kababs! In Toronto, by far this place has the best Joojeh and Barg, I have tried all other famouse persian resturants in town. The price is reasonable, the food is fantastic! Not a fancy place but the food is the best."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant ....definitely a visit worth. The kababs are huge and juicy, not like other Persian restaurants.....and the staff is very respectful and kind. I can't wait to visit them again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Kebobs are very tender with perfect seasoning! The staff are very friendly which makes it a pleasant place to have the perfect dinner or lunch at!"}
{"text":"Run for your life!! stay far away from this so called restaurant! As a Persian food admirer I have never had such terrible meal. I came there with my boyfriend for a fun night and we both had agonizing stomachache for a whole day after eating their food!! We ordered Mirzaghasemi  and Vaziri (chicken bbq and koobideh) which are of my favourite Persian foods. The Mirzaghasemi tasted like dog puke mixed with garlic. absolutely disgusting taste. funny enough the table next to us were complaining about their food as well. After waiting for half an hour we got the bbq and first thing we noticed was a hair sticking to our bbq. beyond gross but we didn't want to ruin our night so we just picked it out and tried to forget it ever happened. The bbq was completely uncooked inside but the outside was burnt burnt!! we asked them to cook it some more as the Koobideh was super rare!! after the bbq it some we tried it. this was literally the single most disgusting taste koobideh I ever had in my life. I could still feel the terrible taste in my nightmares!! the saffron chicken bbq was cooked ok but the taste was so bad!!! extremely sour and salty and dry beyond imagination!! 
before I forget I want to comment on their rice!! they use a super cheap smelly rice that has a horrible after taste!! it's a cheap brand you can find in Persian store!! It's called gold or yellow rice if I'm not mistaken!! it's was like chewing gums!! 
bottom line is do not go to this place unless you're prepared to waste your time, money and appetite there."}
{"text":"This place had ok Koobideh and ok Chenjeh, but everything else was horrible. The barg was just not good at all. It had no taste and was super hard and raw. The service was ok but they could make it better. One of the worst things is it's so cold inside."}
{"text":"I've essentially tried shomal, gilaneh, bank, pomegranate and darband and I would say shatter Abbas is by far the most consistent with amazing fresh kabobs. I hope they keep it up and it doesn't go downhill like all other Persian restos after being in operation for a while. My go to dish is the koobideh!! Amazinggggg"}
{"text":"Good service.good food.reasonable price.just a small place. I went there with a company of 3.ordered different meal.joje kabab,soltani kabab ,baghali polo with lamb shank .they were all fresh in big portion very generously  and delicious as well.will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's birthday and it absolutely exceeded my expectations (which were already very high to begin with). Everything was fresh, came quickly and was beautifully spiced and delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Parole d'iranien
This is the best Kabab in town
Always come here when I visit Toronto
Simply the best"}
{"text":"Patogh closed down, Darband is too far, Shomal rice makes me cry and Banu is contemporary. If it wasn't for a nice friend, I'd keep driving by Shater Abbas, to never discover their great khoresht and kabob. 

The place is best suitable for a quick dine-and-go or take-out, as it is small and isn't exactly cozy. Muted colours, modern furniture, very clean and well-maintained. 

I've been spoiled rotten with great homemade Persian food so if I don't like your rice, I really don't care how famous your Ghormeh Sabzi is (which I am also terribly picky about because it's my least favourite dish but when prepared right, it's a star). Their rice is closest to what I've actually loved in a while. Soltani kabob melts in your mouth and it's far superior to their koobideh. Baghali polo is very aromatic and a single portion is quite generous, you may not be able to handle it with an appetizer. My all-time favourite Fesenjan was quite close to being well-balanced, if it didn't end up on an oilier side, much like the Ghormeh Sabzi. Both dishes had plenty of flavour to make up for it. 


Not a place to get comfortable at, but a great idea to stop by for a quick meal with friends. An ideal dish to split in a rush would be their appetizer trio of your favourite dips and picklings. It's enormous and bread is fresh. Service is prompt and friendly, foreigner or not. Take-out service is very speedy, regardless of how busy they are. 

I travel all the way from Lakeshore for my takeout! Gives me an excuse to complete my Persian dining experience by grabbing pastry from Heloo Goolub and groceries at Parsian Fine Foods. Those 3 businesses make that plaza a great one."}
{"text":"We went to Toronto for vacation on 4th of july this year ,we visit this restaurant ,amazing food and service ,I recommend this place to whoever in in love with persian food. Thanks Shater Abbas"}
{"text":"the meat quality, the way its cooked and the rice is just amazing. i have tried more than 25 Persian kabob restaurants in Toronto and Shater Abbas is with no doubt the best. 
They have a nice staff and the price compared to the quality you get is very reasonable. I recommend Shater Abbas to everyone."}
{"text":"The owner of this place is a total thief and tried to cheat us by double charging us. Here is the story:

I took my family to this restaurant on July 16th for lunch. We ordered the food and it was okay, nothing great though. Service was below average and the place is too small. The bill came out around $132. I put my American Express credit card and the waiter took it and swiped it and came back saying that they don't accept Amex cards. I said fine, please give me the decliner receipt for my credit card since you've already swiped it and I'll pay cash. Before giving me the receipt, I already gave her the cash and was waiting for her to hand me over the declined receipt for my Amex card. However, the receipt she gave me was an \"approved\" receipt! I was shocked and told her that this is an approved transaction and you have already charged me the full amount on my credit card so please return the cash. She answered that she needs to confirm with the owner who was sitting at a table next to the cash register. He was a grumpy old Persian man and took the approved credit card receipt from me to have a look. He then shouted that \"no we don't accept Amex and this is a declined transaction and we cannot return your cash\"! I tried to explain to him that this is an approved transaction but he was rude, stubborn, and a total thief. They even asked me to leave because I was taking away time from their \"other customers\"!!! I became very frustrated and told them that this is an approved transaction and I'm not going to let you double charge me both on my credit card and by taking cash. So you are either returning my cash or I am not leaving this restaurant at all! They finally returned my cash after making me stand for almost 30 minutes and after shouting at me and insulting me in front of my family and guests! Even after returning the cash, they did not apologize and almost threw the money on the counter in front of me! The owner meanwhile was shouting in Farsi that \"just give it to her and tell her to get out of here\"! I was so furious but controlled my anger as I was with family and had guests with me. I took my money and left and will never ever go back to this place! The owner is a complete thief and is extremely rude and disrespectful to his customers! Avoid this place at all costs! They will try to scam you if they get a chance!!!"}
{"text":"Went: 12:00 pm Sat Apr 4 2015
Ordered: one kebab dish and do not recall the other
Cost: incl. tax and tip $25-30
Comments: I am reviewing restaurants that I've been into in the last 3 months, but I'm forgetting the details. My apologies.
The meat was more sour than I anticipated which was not exactly to my liking. I recall liking the other dish we ordered.
Bottom line: I would come back again. This is 3.7 stars. I was not as blown away as other yelp reviewers."}
{"text":"We have been several times and have brought Persian friends here as well. Their comment was, \"This is the real deal for good Persian food.\""}
{"text":"4.5 Stars

Came here on a Saturday night and enjoyed our dinner.. at the suggestion of the Server, we got Combo #2. The steak, chicken leg, and kabob were properly cooked. I always lather the butter on the meat, but I know alot of people like to put it on the rice. I think any Persian cook (esp. the Grandmas) pride themselves in how well they make the rice, and the rice here was of very good quality and properly cooked. 

We also ordered the fried eggplant dip, the bread they serve with it is incredible. The eggplant is topped with  like a sesame seed/tahini dressing, mint oil, walnuts, and some fried crunchy bits of garlic or shallot. Well worth it.

Anyways, in our effort to try and feed our son traditional authentic food, this place delivers. My wife also mentioned the restaurant is clean, servers are friendly, and the food is served and presented well."}
{"text":"Generally when they are not too busy, the quality of the Persian food is one of the best in the city. If you have not had Persian kebab before, you will not be disappointed.

The Persian kebabs here are delicate, well marinated, and melt in your mouth. The chefs here really have a special skill to consistently push out very high-quality food.

Generally, the service is pretty good but when they are busy I can get quite hectic and you may have to repeat certain things.

The homemade yoghurt drink called \"dough\" is delicious and refreshing. 

You're going to pay a little bit more than other person places here but the food quality is well worth it.

The furniture and ambiance isn't top-notch but this place is a cozy family oriented smaller restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken kebob and beef (chenjeh). Chicken was raw and uncooked and chenjeh was so salty that I think it has increased probability of getting a heart attack. 

Also, it would be nice if the waiters learn to smile after leaving them a good tip that they didn't deserve."}
{"text":"Service was quick and menu items are clear with pictures despite being relatively novice for Persian food. Ordered combo 2 which comes with 3 skewers (koobideh, beef tenderloin and chicken thighs) and 2 sides. The basmati rice was plentiful, fluffy and light. You can choose to have 2 rice, or change one of them to bread or salad. All 3 skewers were juicy and flavourful. Enough to share for 2-3 people.

Love the mixed green salad, so fresh and crunchy. A little watery on the bottom, but the crisp veggies help cleanse the palate after eating the meats. 

Would come back to try other dishes! Lots of locals come for dinner and takeout!"}
{"text":"The best in everything. You can order anything, and every dish is on point! Whenever we have friends we bring them here, non Iranians even thinks the food is heavenly."}
{"text":"The food was good, we had Barg kabab and the Torsh(sour) kabab. Not going back for the dining room service ever again, as the older lady who was our server did not even let us look at the menu as she said kitchen will close soon (it was 9pm and they close at 10). So we had no choice but to order something off our heads and not from the menu! She was very unprofessional and rude and spoke to everybody in that tone! After we ordered, there were other people arriving who had other servers and actually had the chance to look at the menu! Will definitely not recommend the dining room, but the food is worth a try..."}
{"text":"In short: it's a good restaurant and I'm happy for what I got for the money I spent. And I'll probably go back again. So, that's that. 

The food was good, the quality and taste were more than average. I'd say they do a good job in clocking the kabobs. I also tried their Baqali Polo and liked it very much. 

The reason why I gave them three stars is how the staff worked and treated us when we visited their establishment. They were quick in serving but I think for some reason they found smiling a bit hard. In general I felt I wasn't welcomed at all which significantly changed my experience. Next time, perhaps I will try their takeout rather than siting and eating my food there."}
{"text":"Placed a pick up order and got shouted at.
Food was amazing.
Service was horrendous."}

It was clean

Nice music tho!

{"text":"I attend as a first time with my family (5 together). We all ordered Different Kabab like Kabab torsh, chenjeh, barg, koobideh and baghalipolo but we all agreed although the foods were clean and nice served, the quality were not good. On top of that, the cashier was not nice at all while I was paying my bill. She was RUDDDDDDD .
dump it
Wont go anymore!"}
{"text":"So.. much..food. 

Please come here with a large group of people and order one main dish for all of you. I couldn't believe the size of the dishes when they came out. Needless to say, we over ordered.

We started with an appetizer; sini Mazzeh which is a combination of three choices of cold appetizers. I think we opted for the one with eggplant (fried), the BBQ eggplant, and the creamy yogurt (my favourite). If you're here with a large group of people, a combination app (about $15) is awesome. If not, just get the creamy yogurt one!

The entrees are large and the prices are very fair for the amount of food that you get. We ordered 3 mains for 5 people (and still had leftovers). We ordered two skewers of the chef's lamp and beef special group mix, marinated tenderloin, and chicken (about $12-19 each). Each came with a large roasted tomato and plenty of rice. The meal tasted so good with the creamy yogurt, so I would highly recommend ordering them together!"}
{"text":"First timer, went with family, large group (10 ppl). Don't take reservations, but accommodated us quite quickly, less than 5 minutes wait. The ambiance is average, not fine dining, but spacious enough, well lit and during meal time super busy. 

Food is excellent, I give it 5 stars. Meat is very succulent, portions are very good too. Ordered the platter and everyone really enjoyed. Roasted eggplant appetizer also very good. The yogurt drink could be thicker, tasted a bit watery for my taste, but still enjoyable.  The lamb shank was my favourite, very tender and the sauce/gravy was fingerlicking good. 

Service = 3 stars. We were served by a girl mainly and she was very nice and respectful from the very beginning (5 stars). She took our initial order well and was very helpful. Now, I am almost always one to give everyone the benefit of doubt, but there was another male server, who was very rude on numerous occasions (1 star). His behaviour was as if he was doing us a favour by taking our order. I usually don't make such negative comments or complaint about service understanding how difficult and chaotic it can be, but the guy's behaviour really left a bad feeling and multiple people within my party noticed.

 I would definitely go again, for the food. I hope management provides some etiquette training to the sever. Wouldn't want another dining ruined because of rude service."}
{"text":"Great food.. At first it seems the prices are a bit on the expensive side but the portions are huge. The two skewer combos are more than enough for two people. I recommend the dark chicken meat kebab and the eggplant appetizer."}
{"text":"Nice authentic Persian cuisine. Modern decor that welcomes the dressed up or the casual visitor. You can view the cook making fresh bread. The food portions are large - great value for the dollar. We were served quickly by multiple servers which lead to a bit of confusion. Eg. Asked for water 3 times. Does not accept AMEX. Good experience."}
{"text":"Went out on a limb and took the family out for a lunch. We tried a few items and they were pleasantly delicious! We loved the beef tenderloin... the pomegranate sauce was delicious! We even asked for more! I'm not a fan of lamb but my mom and boyfriend loved the lamb shank... the meat fell off the bone. Definitely give it a try if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Amazing service, they have the best Kebob barg and fresh homemade bread in town! I am so pleased to find this place and will go back there anytime I'm in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"I was amazed how orders are delivered in less than 5 minutes. We ordered Baghali Polo, it was a huge plate, two people cannot easily finish one order. Very delicious, Persian food selections from Kabobs to stews. For sides we ordered zytoon parvarde ( special olive, pommegranate paste with grounf walnut), good quality stuff.

This place is highly recommended, great for take out or dine in, friendly staff and good quality food with very reasonable price."}
{"text":"We noticed all the positive reviews so we decided to come and give this place a shot. Place is clean. Service is quick and friendly. We shared combo#2 so we can try a bit of everything. All tasted great. Personally I recommend chicken leg kebab. Proportions are huge here. Prices are reasonable. Free WiFi (password is their phone number)"}
{"text":"The food is nice, above average, the staff was cold and could have been a lot nicer. They weren't rude or mean, but lacked hospitality. We had an assortment of salad. The eggplant was really good, the rest was alright. We then had a combo with lamb and chicken, the peas, the spinach and another lamb with sauce. The lamb with sauce was exquisite and the rest was good. Overall, the place is clean, although a bit small and it feels a bit too fast food for the price. I don't regret going, but I won't go again."}
{"text":"TL;WR: Great Persian food with portion sizes that match the price. Their kebabs and other meats were cooked perfectly. I recommend the Baghala Polo 4/5, which can easily be shared amongst two people with moderate appetites. Good customer service.
Barberry rice &Chicken - 4/5
Kashke Bademjan - 4.5/5
Koobideh kebab - 4/5

Review:

Located North of yonge and centre, Shater Abbas offers some great Persian food that's a solid bang for your buck.  I came here on Sunday around noon not too long after the location opened. As we entered there were a couple tables already seated, which is always a good sign. The interior was very simple and looks perfect for casual dinner or lunch outings. My friends and I got the Kashke Bademjan ($7), Baghala Polo ($16), Chicken leg w/ Barberry rice ($12) and Koobideh Kebab ($13) with Salad instead of rice.

The Badmejan came first and it was a bigger portion than I thought it would be. I've been a fan of this comforting dish for a while and it's great as a spread on the flatbread that was already provided. The mains came not long after and one thing that was immediately apparent was the huge portion sizes, definitely worth the money spent. When I got the Baghala Polo, my friends questioned my ability to actually finish the meal as the lamb shank hiding underneath the rice made the dish seem like a rice mountain. The lamb shank was perfectly cooked and the meat was fall off the bone tender. The braised sauce that was was provided with the dish was not as oily as I thought  (though it did have a nice pair of oil) would be and was a great addition to the broad bean and dill rice which wasn't as good as I expected it to be, but it still pretty good. Overall I'd give this dish a 4/5. The Barberry rice with the chicken thigh was pretty good as well, the chicken was cooked really well and wasn't dry, and the barberries added a nice taste and texture to the rice. Though the reduced sauce on the side didn't have too much flavour to it. This dish was a 4/5.

If you're someone who wants to get less carbs into their body and actually have hopes of finishing your meal with ease, replacing the rice with a house salad as my friend did. The Koofteh kebab was cooked well and the house salad was very fresh. I think that the kebab could have been better but it definitely did not disappoint. This is another 4/5.

This restaurant was a great find for Persian food, and the prices are pretty fair for the portions they offer. The service was pleasant and the owner made sure to visit every table to check if everything was okay. I will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"3.5 not exactly a 4!I wish I could give them a 5 star but it's not happening, read on you will find out why.

So I had bookmarked this restaurant for quite sometime and was was super excited to gorge on Persian Kabobs on of the coldest nights we had.

The restaurant is clean and midsize with plenty of tables.Soon the server Reza took our order which was a order of the kobbideh kababs and one order of the Vaziri which has a skewer of koobidehh and one of jojeh(chicken).i also asked for a bread too.

The restaurant wasn't too busy our order was out in 15 mins.They forgot to bring my bread.While I was eating I realized they never got me any sides which were on pretty much everyone's table.I asked for some onions but never got any lemon on parsley or radishes which normally are served with all Irani entrees.That kinda ticked me off.But each time I reminded the staff they happily brought everything to table.

Coming down to the food.It was absolutely divine I loved their jojeh kabobs(chicken) over the koobideh because I have had better koobideh but over all the food is fantastic and hits the spot.The entrees are huge and fresh.The meat was tender and extremely juicy.We had lotsa leftovers for next day.The pricing is very standard to the industry.

They is ample of free parking around the restaurant.Will definitely go there again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If I'm ever in the mood for Persian food, this is my go-to place! It's quite close to where I live as well so anytime we have family visiting, we always make sure to bring them here at least once for dinner. This place is just north of Yonge and Clarke and there's a private lot for parking. Service is fast and they are very polite. I'm not Persian and sometimes when I come in they'll ask \"oh, you like Persian food?!\". This is definitely a local favourite for the Persian community.

My boyfriend and I like to split the vaziri kebabs (I eat one skewer of chicken breast and he eats one skewer of lamb/beef) for about $17. It comes with rice and a grilled tomato (no sauce unfortunately). It's so much food that I often have enough leftover for lunch the next day! I would not suggest upgrading your rice to one with dried cranberries. They were really really sour and it wasn't worth it. However, I do highly suggest trying one of their dips in the appetizer section!"}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I'm not a Persian/Middle Eastern food lover to begin with (never have any cravings for a sharwarma and the likes, and frankly quite uneducated in this cuisine). My hubby and I came here to try this place out as it is in our neighbourhood.  My verdict is that this place was decent - a solid 3 out of 5 stars, and here's why:

SERVICE & DRINKS
As a pair of lost-looking Asian couple, I felt like we got some extra friendly attention from the staff.  We asked them for drink suggestions, and my hubby got a small yogurt drink (see pic) . Well this other time I had gone to an Indian restaurant and ordered a yogurt drink, my stomach couldn't handle it too well, so I have since smartened up and not order any yogurt drink.  They are heavier and spicier than your supermarket-bought yogurt - they are just not the same.  I'll spare the detail...basically my hubby got the same reaction I did. I don't think there was anything wrong with the drink, just that our stomachs are too weak to handle it.  Plus we didn't like the taste that much, though I see others ordering a whole jug and seemed to enjoy it.  

FOOD
We thought the price was reasonable for the quality of food; it wasn't top-notch, but was decent.  We tried their Combo #2, which included 3 types of meat (in order of preference): 
1. Barg (beef tenderloin - though my husband's Persian colleague advised him that's veal - not sure), 
2. Chicken leg kebab (had a tangy spice flavour), and
3. Koobideh (ground lamb and beef mix) kebab 

ENVIRONMENT
The place looked clean and had pretty nice wall décor. We just found it funny how the 3 overhead TVs showed Persian Real Estate Agents' ads sometimes. 

TIPS: 
If you don't mind a bit greasy/fatty, the rice tastes better with the butter that comes with it."}
{"text":"I walked in because the table near the window had some bowls of robust salads and plates of appealing marinated olives all to be shared family style.  Looking further around, most tables were full of smiling faces.

It was busy so, in we went for a take out order to give it a try. The staff were friendly and efficient.  We ordered Sultan kebab, Marinated olives, Special salad.  The staff let us know that because each dish is prepared to order it would take 10-15 minutes till it would be ready.  The order arrived punctually.

From the restaurant to the car we could smell the lovely aroma so we tucked in to the dishes before leaving the parking lot.  That may have been the best kebab I've had in decades.  A plate of perfectly seasoned succulent meats laying over aromatic rice with a hint of saffron and garnished with perfectly grilled whole tomato.  That together with the savoury and slightly sweet olives accompanied by a robust specialty salad has kept me thinking all week about Shater Abbas Restaurant.

Looking forward to going there again, this time to dine in."}
{"text":"Not my Favorite, but will do.

I like the decor of the place, comfortable seating.
Food: Meat platters are on the ok side - tasty, but I have tried much better in same level persian restaurants in the same area.
I loved their olive appetizer.
I tried their vine leaves appetizer and was excited cause I usually love that dish, but it was way less than average... It actually felt like it was taken out of a can, put on plate and heated up --
Overall, its an average place, but wont be going back there for sure..."}
{"text":"I love  here. That's my main motivation and kebab barg. I don't recommend Sabzi at all. But a very good place to enjoy kebab."}
{"text":"My overall rating is 1 star.

Ordered Koobideh and Fasanjoon fesenjoon Fesenj?n


The Koobideh only came with rice and one grilled tomatoe, no salad

The Fasanjoon only came with rice


When I ordered both items above, the woman at the cash should have asked me if I want rice with both or rice and salad, instead they gave me 2 orders of rice for both items and I ended up with a lot of rice that is unnecessary.


I saw that they were including some vegetables for dinning in and I asked her if I would be getting that also for takeout, she said no as it's only available for dinning in but later said she will include it, I got Home and noticed they did NOT include it.


I've ordered Koobideh at Kako Kabob in Richmond Hill not far from this place, it came with both rice and salad, and 2 grilled tomatoes!

Same thing at Shomal Restaurant which is the best Persian Restaurant, located around Yonge and Steeles area.


The Taste of Fasanjoon Fesenjoon was good, however nothing special with the Koobideh, I've had much better at Shomal or Kako Restaurant.

Would I go back here again? Absolutely no."}
{"text":"Recommend by my Persian collegue and I can say it was a good reco.  I really enjoy the kabobs and rice they go well together, got the combo 3 so you get a variety of meet to try like barg, chicken and koobideh  (ground lamb and beef).  The service was okay they are very busy and short of staff it seems but I didn't have hight expectation for service going in was there for the kabobs."}
{"text":"A poor quality Persian restaurant with terrible service. The older lady that served us was inpatient and rude. The food was nothing to write home about. I will never eat here again nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Good quality food: well-seasoned and adequately juicy  Kabab  and chicken, yummy kashke bademjoon( fully garnished with  crispy onion chips and fresh whey sauce), aromatic saffron rice. The two stars are just for its great food, not the whole experience!

Very poor service: received no welcome nothing. Being rushed to choose quickly as they were about to close in 45min!! Being served with grumpy servers with frowning faces as if they were forced to work there! (I should say there was only one exception among them! ) They didn't even bring us bread for the kashkbademjoon.

Overall, highly recommended for take outs not dine in."}
{"text":"The service is very fast. Pita bread was fresh and just baked. We came with a persiana friend and everything she ordered for us was absolutely amazing. We finished it all. Very affordable and we had great dinner."}

Great apps. the Zeytoon Parvardeh was to DIE FOR and the Kabob torsh !!! 

nice portions"}
{"text":"Pros:Food is good. Staff are helpful.

Cons: washroom out of order. They don't have regular items from the menu. I asked for ice which interestingly this restaurant don't have!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Persian food and for the price you pay you get a lot of food, food is fresh made, and taste excellent"}
{"text":"Nice place to go with family or hang out with friends. Delicious food, good portion and fair price. Polite staff with good customer service."}
{"text":"Shater Abbas is a most suitable place to introduce an uncultured friend to the fine cuisine of Iran.

A key to identifying a good Persian restaurant is not by their meat, but by their rice. Persian rice needs to be light, fluffy, and soft with just the right amount of salt. Shater Abbas does just that. A sprinkle of sumac later, and I've wiped my plate clean, its THAT good.

The quality and taste of the kabobs don't get better than this. From everyone's favourite juicy koobideh kabob to the more delicate tender barg kabob, whatever Shater Abbas does, it does well.

As for something to wash that manly meal down, doogh, a popular yogurt soda that is homemade on the premises will definitely hit the spot. Its refreshing and creamy, but not too acidulating as doogh may sometimes get. 

I also recommend getting the tadiq here. Crispy oily rice from the bottom of the pot is the perfect side to snack on while you wait for your meal to arrive.

Shater Abbas has a lot of potential to becoming a local hot spot if it glams its place up a little.  But as for food, its four stars from me."}
{"text":"OMG, I am very picky on food, but fox trust me this food was amazing ,taste, quality and 
also presentation on the plate. all kind of kabob  were SO good , I just wanted to appreciate them , although its small place but nice people and perfect food, I hope they keep up with this.
I take my guests there. absolutely yeas"}
{"text":"Goood: food quality.
Bad: service.
Ugly: overpriced. 
P.s: they don't give half rice/half salad in this store which is very wired. Also they did not bring us bread unlike other good Persian restaurants.
Overall rating: mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Persian food and Shater Abbas did everything to reinforce my liking for it.

Pros:
Good portions
Friendly service

Cons:
Seats are a little close to each other

Came here for dinner Saturday night based on reviews from Yelp. Shater Abbas is a tiny little place but was very busy when we came in.  We were seated pretty quickly as turnover here is pretty quick.

We ordered the chicken leg skewer and lamb shank dinners.  Because they cook your food to order here, it was about 15-20 minutes before the food came.  This is pretty standard though so it's nothing big.  I do imagine during very busy times it could take longer.  

The chicken leg skewer comes with some breast meat as well.  I imagine it's one chicken leg and then breast meat to fill the rest of the skewer.  My little one loved it so the chicken was not overdone.  She won't eat chicken if it's overdone and too dry.  My lamb shank was very good as well.  It also wasn't overdone and well cooked.  They give you a small bowl which holds the sauce the lamb shank is braised in as well which I have never gotten before at other places.  This sauce is a welcome addition as it basically acts like a gravy.  Who doesn't like gravy??

I do have to mention that Shater Abbas gives you a lot of rice.  The biggest portion of rice I have ever had at Persian restaurants.  My gripe is always I don't get enough rice.  This place had me very full at the end of my meal.

Service here was very friendly. We are not their usual clientele but never once did we feel like we were treated any differently.  The servers were all very nice and answered any questions we had politely.  

Shater Abbas may just be my new go to place for Persian food.  The prices are fair and the portions good.  If you're a fan of Persian food I suggest you give this palce a try."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh, and the portions are big. The kebabs are so juicy and delicious! I got combo #2 for two people with one rice and one garden salad and it was more than enough. The Barg (broiled tenderloin) is definitely my favourite out of the three."}
{"text":"This place is not going to be my favourite Iranian restaurant, but the food is not bad by any means either.
I feel they occupy the middle ground between the cheaper take-out only places like Kako or Taftan and the higher end food and atmosphere Iranian places like Alborz, Shishlix or Persian Palace. Think of this restaurant as something like Persia next to No Frills.

You know they are catering prominently to the take-out market with the overhead menu. They were doing robust dine-in business for dinner though.

There were three of us and we ordered a combo and a sour kabob in order to sample nearly every type of kabob they have. We left the home-style stews, etc to another visit.

The food was good, portions were adequate and the service was kind. I like their rice and kabobs. They asked us if we wanted appetizers and then asked the same of the occupants of the next table when it was occupied so it is something of a routine of theirs, one supposes. We skipped it. My experience is that Iranian restaurants fill you up adequately.
There were a couple of moments of forgetfulness on their part, but they were rectified with a smile. This is a small restaurant and the service is not so professional even if they are earnest in trying.
The wash room was relatively clean, but there were salt and pepper on our table, which meant the table was not carefully wiped. There was a ton of dust sitting on their heating (or was it AC?) unit above the entrance as well. Otherwise, it seemed like a clean place.
Prices are average.
There is a second location of theirs in North York and apparently the name is associated with a famous restaurant somewhere in Iran as well."}
{"text":"Visited last weekend with my husband's family who are Persian and had a great dining experience! Kebabs are the best we have had in the GTA (and we have tried a lot of different places)! My husband and his brother both agreed the kebabs here are the closest they have had to being back in Iran. We ordered the Combo 3 which was koobideh, sultani and jujeh (chicken breast) with grilled tomatoes and two huge plates of rice. Meat was well cooked without being overdone, rice was tasty! Also ordered mast o mousir and khashk bademjan... Sooo good! First time there and will be back. Also recommended for my family to try (they are not Persian) and they went and also had a fantastic experience mid-week. Service was good as well!"}
{"text":"We were visiting for the weekend so I bookmarked couple persian places. We ended up at Shater Abbas as it was nearby and had great reviews. We rarely get the same thing when eating out but this was an exception as we both ordered koobideh however, I got it with bread and she with rice. This way we can both have a bit of rice and bread. Rice was nice and buttery and tomatoes were perfectly charred. Koobideh was very juicy but lacking in flavor. It was still pretty good and we enjoyed it a lot but it didn't compare with our favorite koobideh place. Our quest to find a place better than flame kabob in Raleigh continues... Until then if you are in the area Shater Abbas is a decent substitute"}
{"text":"The best kabab. nice emplyee. friendly environment. the cheapest. Although it is a little crowdy but it worth to wait."}
{"text":"This place is has amazing kebabs. I ordered their special- two huge lamb/beef kabobs on a bed of rice. Cost was 10.99. My girlfriend got the lamb shank. We're pretty big eaters and we couldn't finish our meals! I'd definitely come back here again for legit Persian food."}
{"text":"Great Persian food in Thornhill. 

Ive eaten Persian food across the city and this little joint has it going on.

The koobideh is one of the finest I've had. No doubt they are using quality ingredients here.  Chicken leg kebab is my fave though. 

Recently catered a small office lunch from here and all my staff were impressed.  It's not the cheapest place around but it's worth it IMHO."}
{"text":"Delicious kabobs... Juicy and fresh at a reasonable price... Most definitely try their Chenjeh or Soltani plates"}
{"text":"I came with friends and family under the recommendation of my (Persian) friend. This is not a fancy restaurant. It's a storefront restaurant in a strip mall and the decor is plain and functional. So, don't come here for ambiance. But DO come for the food, the friendly staff, and the price too. These people know what they are doing. The food is good, well portioned and decently priced.

The eggplant dish was AMAZING. Pomegranate beef was succulent, but perhaps a bit too sour for me. The bean soup superb and the standards of Koobideh and Soultani Kebabs were juicy. I couldn't finish my dish, but likely that's because I was tasting from other peoples plates."}
{"text":"-They are very particular about finishing up  right at 10:30 ..
-They brought me Chenjeh instead of Barg and charged me Barg
-If you wanna get Chenjeh..pay 1$ more and get an extra skewer of joojeh by changing your order to Soltani
-Qorme sabzi that they brought us was not hot..it was just quite warm!!
- They do not have tahdig"}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating. 
I think the last time I've had Persian/Iranian food was more than a year ago. My boyfriend and I decided to be adventurous on the weekend, and with all the good reviews so we gave this place a try.

Originally I was going to go for the lamb/beef skewer and chicken leg skewer, but the staff recommended the lamb/beef skewer and tenderloin veal instead which I am so glad I went with her recommendation. 
Sultani Kebab ($20.99) One ground lamb beef skewer, and one broiled tenderloin, served with rice and a roasted grilled tomato. The tenderloin was my favorit, the meat was really tender, soft and juicy. The rice was ok, but I felt like it could have used some extra flavor or sauce on top. This dish is a lot of food for one person.  

We ordered an appetizer: Mirzaghasemi ($5.99)
A combination of mashed BBQ eggplant, eggs, garlic & spices. Although the presentation isn't the greatest, it actually tasted pretty good. It reminded me of an  eggs and tomatoes Chinese dish, with eggplant added in. It tasted more on the sweet side. They served it with Nan, so it was sort of like a dip.

Ghormeh Sabzi ($10.99)
Decided to be adventurous and give this a try as it was recommended by the staff. Traditional mixed herbs, red beans, meat and dry lime stew. Instead of having it with rice, we had it with the Nan. This wasn't much of my liking in terms of flavor and texture, not sure if it had anything to do with the spices. 

Overall I enjoyed my food adventure here and would be open to trying other dishes when I return. I'm curious about the chicken leg skewer, and the yogurt drink that everyone seemed to be drinking."}
{"text":"Great food. Generous portions. Juicy kabob. It is busy in the weekends which makes you wait more but it is worth it. Absolutely recommended Iranian restaurant."}
{"text":"The chicken was a lot better than the koobideh. The rice did not seem fresh. The ghormeh Sabzi was delicious but is only two dollars less if you order the stew alone. It's cheaper at other persian restaurants. Service was excellent. I would recommend this place but if you like koobideh then order something else"}
{"text":"Ordered combo 3.  It comes with two plates or rice (or bread), one skewer of chicken breast kebob, one skewer of koobideh, one skewer of barg kebob, 3 grilled tomatoes, a plate of parsley and sliced radish, a bunch of basil.  No salad.

The meat were all very flavourful, not dry and juicy!!! The taste was very good.   Definitely a lot of food for two people. :)

The waitress was very friendly and attentive.  

I read another review that they do not accept amex, and yeah they really don't.  But I asked before I paid for the meal so it's ok."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm I love this little kabob JOINT! 
I'm Italian so it's a little tricky for me to type out/say what I ordered lol, But you must try the MARINATED olives mmmm and the Yogurt cucumber dip with bread . I always order the BARG kebob, hudge portions (steak kabob with rice) 
Great service, clean , adorable atmosphere"}
{"text":"Just came here again. Got 1 skewer jooje, 1 skewer Barg and asked for it to be a combo with rice, And a soltani combo. They charged us $57 dollars initially, and messed up by not making the separate skewers as a combo, and they had the nerve to argue that we did not order that. They then told us to pay for rice. So the total came to $61 after we were forced to buy the rice.

The food is good, but the staff is horrendous, it's on the pricier side. Change your attitudes or no one will come to your restaurant again."}
{"text":"If you are a resident of north of Toronto and a fan of kabob, you are not without your options. The mini takeout spots seem to be popping up everywhere. They all seem to offer pretty much the same menu. Barg (tenderloin), koobideh (ground meat) and joojeh (chicken) are the staples at these places. The quality of the meat and the way it is prepared varies from place to place. I found the barg at Shater Abbas to be very good. In fact, I was so impressed with the tenderness of the meat that I was hardly bothered by some of the flaws I noticed with the food and service. For example, the rice served with the kabob was dry and low quality by my guess. The dressing used for the salad was obviously of the cheap store bought variety. The mast-o-musir (yogurt and shallots) dip we ordered did not come with bread and it probably never occurred to the waitress that we would need some. Next time I wander into Shatter Abbas, I'd like to try the authentic looking dizi (a traditional stew) that was served with ghusht koob and crocks to the table next to us."}
{"text":"For the price/value combo - the kubideh (grilled kabab made of growing beef) and rice combo here is top notch. Juicy tender beef (2 skewers) - a generous portion of rice with tomato. All for $13.99! Enough for lunch for two people. Great deal. Nice interior and staff were friendly enough. I'll return when in the hood"}
{"text":"Yummy & delicious!  It's a small busy place. We ordered $100 worth of food for take out to serve 10 people at home. Ordered koobideh, jojeh etc I had positive feedbacks from everyone. Something different than having pizza and Chinese food. I'm glad that they all enjoyed Persian food. For dessert, we had a tray of baclava from Paramount. Good combination. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"1st time here and never again if you are not Persian then they will treat you like SHIT and sad part is food was good as long you can stand being treated like 2nd class citizen also got over charged for food did not received and mistake made by the waiter of taking order who refuse to admit it was his mistake but we paid for it. also he never checked on us to see if we liked the food. we where seated by the table beside the washroom who has table that close to a washroom door that doesn't close itself and my friends had to get up to close it middle of eating WTF four people $90 money I rather gave if homeless"}
{"text":"Life if full of first and this was my first time in a Persian Restaurant. I thought it would be just like the other mid-east places but I was definitely wrong. Persian food is similar with the kebabs, breads, dips but the spices are different and they like to use nuts in much of their offerings.
The combo-2 has three different meats (koobideh, barg, chicken leg) with two large plates of rice. The yogurt dip had mints and cucumber. The eggplant dip (kahsk-e-bademjan) had a medley of flavours in a small dish. Washing down the meal was a couple of malt drinks - istak and a white yogurt type drink (doogh). We also had a ghormeh sabzi - a green mint/meat stew dish and a couple large flat roti like bread.
Minus the Sabzi, the meal was great. I just could not get around the spices in the Sabzi. Also, they forgot it and rushed it out - the meat was lumpy and still frozen.
We don't normally order this much food but we wanted to try the widest variety so we can really get a feel for Iranian cuisine. Both dips were great, the kebabs were enjoyable and the istak non alcoholic malts was a treat. 
A definite return trip is in order."}
{"text":"Amazing Persian food!  The koobideh is super moist and flavourful, and the ghormeh sabzi was spot on!  

Definitely one of the top Persian restaurants in the area !"}
