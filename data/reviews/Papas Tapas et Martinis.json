Just came back from a lunch at this poor establishment. Had the midi-express lunch special, which consisted of a salad, a main, and a dessert.  The salad was the most meager item I have ever set my eyes upon. It was a fistful of greens, with a slight olive oil dressing, with one slice of tomato and one slice of raw zucchini. The raw zucchini was extremely unappetizing and had me thinking that whoever did the shopping this week confused cucumber and zucchini. The salad was so small I would have been more pleased with no salad at all. 

When asked what I wanted for my main, I chose the steak. When the waiter did not even ask how I wanted it cooked, I knew I was in for a shitty steak. I specified that I wanted it rare, and got a grey, tough slab of meat in return that was very overcooked. It was not enjoyable in the least.

The dessert was a choice between banana cake and fruit salad. The fruit salad arrived in a martini glass and featured a number of cubed fruits soaked in sugary syrup. It was akin to a Dole canned fruit salad. Very disappointing.

The banana cake was extremely wet (I've never had this style of cake) and arrived with a frozen dairy dessert on top, which ended up being the best part of the entire meal, if that says anything.

The meal was 9.99 which is not expensive. I will give the restaurant that. But the quality of the food was so poor I would have preferred to forego the salad/dessert and just have a decent main.

Again, I must stress - if you are the type to enjoy subpar food, do not miss this place."}

{"text":"I went here in August of 2011 while I was on a short trip to the North. The food was good, and because we went when the restaurant had just opened, we received free martinis with our meal. The waitress who tended us was absolutely \"génial\". She confided that she was also not a native French speaker, and that it was relieving to speak to people who knew English. The ambiance was great, and being seated outside made for a really positive experience. For the portions, however, the food was a little expensive.. I shouldn't have to be cheap when eating Latin/Portuguese food! Good food, good environment, nice people... but it's not worth the price."}
{"text":"I must say I was not impressed by the food here or anywhere we ate in the Montreal area. I would have checked on yelp but my Verizon HTC thunderbolt essentially became a brick once I crossed the canadian border. we tried some of the tapas and I had one beer. They were alright, but nothing to write home about. I have tasted better and more imaginative food elsewhere and paid far less. There was a banner on the restaurant that said they had two other location, New York and Miami. I think that is what drew me in. Unfortunately, it was not great. I would give it 2 1/2 stars if i could."}
