{"text":"Prob best sub shop in town. Great staff and they deliver!! They have a sub that is hard to beat"}
{"text":"Great sub & fresh coffee, all at a great price!  Grabbed it while waiting at the surgery center across the street."}
{"text":"I am highly allergic to onions an I asked for the Turkey with NO ONIONS. well when I got my sandwich it seemed it had extra onions. Sucks i didnt check this sandwich before I left, sure did look like it was gonna be good anywho. So when I called the guy actually told me to bring it back an I told him I was already home. He didnt offer any type of help. Wish i knew his name but i didn't. Anyways with this said check your sandwich before leaving. F y i. The cashier was very nice"}
{"text":"Very friendly and fast service.  I lucked out and got a parking space right in front of the place!  They have excellent bread.  The crunch on the crust blew me away after so many Subway sandwiches.  The Ham and Swiss could've used a little more vinegar though, and the cheese could've been more melted, but that's all that I can really complain about.  My white chocolate slush with boba was also really good.  A large was pretty huge!  I did think it could've used a little bit more flavoring.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great spot hidden within the Chinese Cultural Center. Place was small with limited seating. Perfect for grabbing a quick lunch and heading back to the office. I ordered the Strawberry Walnut Salad and added chicken. It was reasonably priced and delicious.  They also have Bobba Tea! I've only had the strawberry but they have 1/2 price Bobba from 3-5!"}
{"text":"Service is good, but I wouldn't go here for Thai tea with boba again.  The milk had a slightly funky taste (canned, maybe?), and the boba was very chewy.   Also smelled very strongly of disinfectant both times I've been here."}
{"text":"The staff here was really nice, but I would have to give two stars for the boba and drink. I came here for the first time to try their boba. They don't have matcha green tea, so I ordered the milk tea. The boba was honestly nasty and the milk tea didn't taste good either. I drank one sip & said, \"Ew.\" I was very disappointed. If I come back, I'll try their sandwiches but I am not getting the boba again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Super Subs - they make a very good sandwich (much better than a Subway, for example).  It's a little more expensive, but you are paying for the quality.  There were not many employees when we visited, so it took a few extra minutes to place and receive our order, but the service was very friendly.  I also really appreciated their selection which also includes breakfast, salads, and specialty coffees."}
{"text":"Was at the Chinese Ranch Market to buy some snacks when I noticed Super Sub's chalkboard daily special sign out front . Decided it was lunchtime and to give them a shot. I'm glad I did. The sub I got was amazing! I eat lots of Sub's around the valley but this one was the best. The tea was spectacular as well. I'm glad I tried the place. I'll be back again"}
{"text":"First time eating Super Subs and it was indeed super. I had my food delivered-it was quick, delicious, and they correctly made all the modifications to my sandwich!"}
{"text":"I never write a review but this place earned it so this is a write up on there BOBA smoothies as for a BOBA standard smoothies these where awful the BOBA was not cooked correctly which counts for 70 percent of a good quality BOBA. Now just for a regular smoothie without BOBA it is 2 stars.  I won't lead you wrong but I will lead you to good food. Zeke@TastinGastro"}
{"text":"Food is fair, ordered the turkey bacon sub, will order it again. However the delivery person is the reason I am give them 2 stars. First off the drive called to confirm my location he did not identify himself I was told after saying hello...\"did you order a sub\" drive also made it sound like I was an inconvenience to him. After we decided on a pick up location he went to the wrong spot was rude to our security desk. If you order be cautious of deliver."}
{"text":"Slowest. Service. Ever. They had one guy working at noon. One guy. During lunch. Seriously? The rush came and the one guy just kept taking orders. Didn't make sandwiches, just stacked the orders. Don't go here if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I just got a sub from here and I gotta say best sub I've had in a long time !!!! Subs are 5stars  the only reason why I rated 4 stars is because of the Bubble tea, I wanted the taro milk tea and they were out so I tried a different one they suggested but I didn't like it at all , they were kind enough to exchange my drink for another one. I ended up getting the Thai tea . The tea was good but the tapioca Seam like it was not cook very well. They need to work on that other than  that everything else was amazing."}
{"text":"Come see Steve the sandwich guy!  (25 years of experience with sandwiches!!!)  Changed names and changed to be much better   I had the super duper $6.99 but loaded with meat   They also do boba type drinks so you will not leave disappointed!  The only trouble is finding it behind the asian market !"}
{"text":"I work next door to this restaurant. Unfortunately despite giving this shop several chances, I have never been satisfied with the outcome. The manager is always having \"a bad day\", which results in a bad attitude. Orders are frequently wrong, and hot foods are always served cold."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the subs but the boba made me want to go there. It was our first time there and we both had boba drinks. My bf had the lemon slushie with boba and it was so sour it didn't even taste like...lemon! Luckily there was a nice employee who was happy to switch it out and gave us a larger size with a different flavor. Great customer service but boba is Americanized, maybe I'll give their food a try next time."}
{"text":"I came in to Super Subs after a friend told me about their amazing boba drinks (they have jellies and popping jelly too), and decided to get a sub with my smoothie. I got the Turkey Bacon Avocado sub. The bread was soft and fresh, the avocado was ripe, and they weren't skimpy on the bacon! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the turkey club, it was really good but the gunfire was distracting. Just as I was about to bite into my sandy a biker got stabbed and thrown onto my table. Then all heck broke loose and I had to duck under the table because shots rang out from everywhere. The establishment should have a policy against killing other patrons but I guess not. The dessert was pretty good, all in all I would've gave them 4 stars if the AC was turnt up a lil bit more. ~Dr. Bob~"}
{"text":"I am so glad that Super Subs came around and replaced \"Donna's Bakery\".. What an upgrade!  Thank you for getting rid of the chicas that used to work there and replacing them with unintentionally hilarious guys.  Our office is in the Chinese Cultural Center, which is a 2 minute walk away, so we order breakfast and lunch from them quite often.  Snaps for delicious coffee brought up piping hot, crispy bacon, man-bun, the SUPER DUPER, just the right amount of egg on request, Donatello and the rest of the Ninja Turtles, and avocado that doesn't turn brown."}
{"text":"Nice little place in the Chinese Cultural Center complex, not much in the area for lunch there. Had a toasted sub which was fantastic, just make sure you have some time on your hands because they  make everything from scratch when you order it, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Stopped by this sandwich shop after o was done shopping at the market next to it. I was craving boba!   They have a great selection of sandwiches I ordered the turkey avocado sandwich which was good. I wish I would've gone with a blt, but maybe next time.   I also ordered a Thai tea boba, and it was a huge disappointment. There was some boba that was undercooked and some that needed to be a little softer. It's always a struggle to find good boba in Arizona.   Customer service was ok, they could talk and recommend certain items to customers a little. Or at least a little more welcoming."}
{"text":"I've order drinks from here twice in the past with the most recent order leaving me with disappointment.  I had ordered an iced Vietnamese coffee and it was so gross.  It was like iced water with a slight flavor of Viet coffee.  I should have returned it but they took a long time to make it to begin with and I needed to go into work.  Today I came here for lunch with a friend and it was my first time ordering food.  We both ordered their chicken strip basket with fries and my friend opted for a pineapple/mango smoothie mix while I ordered a strawberry boba milk tea.  We both loved the chicken strips and I find the value to be similar to other fast food places that serve this.  It came out really warm, almost too hot to eat actually, but I managed to dig in while my friend waited for hers to cool a little.  I can appreciate this as the establishment doesn't let the food sit for long periods of time and wanting to give you the freshest food possible.  My friend absolutely loved her smoothie and I enjoyed my boba tea.  I've had better elsewhere but this satisfied my boba craving.  I know this place is known for its sandwiches so I'll need to try one next time."}
{"text":"The food ok but the service needs a lot of work. The past two times I have placed an online order through Yelp, come in, and the kitchen staff was too busy on their phones or eating to remember they put my sandwich on the panini press. Burnt sandwich.  Also their prices have increased to a point I can't justify getting a sandwich. A grilled cheese consisting of two slices of bread and two slices of cheese is now $5 while a turkey and cheese or ham and cheese 6\" sub is only $4.39.  Really disappointing."}
{"text":"The small shop has excellent subs and plenty of boba drink options! Good boba is hard to find around Phoenix but this place had some good stuff! Excellent lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I've been in a few times since it changed from Donna's Bakery - the food menu has changed a lot, but the boba menu is basically the same from what I can tell, which is nice, since I'm not sure if anywhere else in the plaza serves boba, and they have a really wide variety. The food portions got a lot bigger and the price stayed fair - it's a win-win! I LOVE the salads and have had a few subs, all were great!"}
{"text":"This place is great, classic sub shop that is always on point. Super fresh and full of ingredients"}
{"text":"This place serves hot & cold sandwiches! They have so many that you can choose from. I like the fact that they make everything fresh & you can taste the love they put into their food! Today I got the lunch special which was a large drink of my choice, the pastrami on rye bread (hot sandwich) along with a side of macaroni salad for$9.50! That was tax included. They have a special everyday of the week, which is nice! Great shop to go too if you want a quick bite to eat, yummy food & friendly service! They also have boba which was cool!! They take cash, debit & credit cards! Stop on in for a delish sandwich!"}
