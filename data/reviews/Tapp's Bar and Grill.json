{"text":"I've been here twice before. The first time was when my girl held her birthday here. It was a nice spot for it since it was close to home and they had pool tables. I didn't care for the food and thought maybe because there were so many of us they weren't used to such a busy service. I came back again last week with my friend and they had a white guy singing chutney music better than most west indian guys. Then he was singing top 40. He was great. I ordered the chicken parm with Alfredo pasta. The chicken was actually pretty good and covered in a yummy cheese blend. The pasta was really bland. I had asked for hot sauce that I didn't get until after my meal was done. And when they first brought out my plate it was the wrong meal. They didn't bring out any condiments for my friends nachos like salsa and sour cream, which was odd. The place is a bit sketchy and looking around it looks like a place you'd bring a girl you don't want to get caught with. If you want to just get a drink this isn't a bad place to do it. The patio is pretty cool but the area is a little questionable."}
{"text":"Sports bar my ass. We went into here to watch the raptors game and they didn't want to play the sound out loud for fear of offending customers. Don't go here if you want to watch an important game. The vibes are just off. The service was slow and when we walked in she was on her cell phone. And we stood there forever. Also the food was so bad. Don't get the poutine. We tried it out. Never again."}
{"text":"i've visited this place a few times and it's great! one noticeable thing is their service. the last time i was there, it was a superbowl night and although the place was pretty packed, the servers were attentive and brought drinks for my table in a very timely manner. also, one time my friend spilt drink on her food that was barely touched, and the manager saw it and made another one for her at no charge!
food is better than average as well.
another thing i like about here is that they have different events all the time - live music nights, dance nights, prize nights, etc so you can feel different vibes depending on when you visit so you won't get bored of this place."}
{"text":"No...I've had it with this place. I refuse to go back. Management changed sometime last year and this place took a HUGE dive...worse than before.
There is ONE waitress who works the entire restaurant. The service is hugely lacking as a result.

Last time I went, they had half price appetizers. We were told that they couldn't separate the bill and she brought us one large bill....oh, but SHE couldn't subtract the half price from our apps, because she needed the manager, who wasn't there to do it. So she found DIFFERENT items, that were the same cost as the half price items we got and made the bill with them....well how in hell are we supposed to divide up our bill, based on items we didn't order????!? It was actually shockingly stupid. 

We all guessed as best we could and threw in cash...I for one threw in the towel too. The food continues to be subpar at best, the prices are not great, even with half price and the service is horrendously terrible. This place is a waste of time and money."}
