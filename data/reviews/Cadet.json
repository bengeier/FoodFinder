{"text":"Simply put great food, great service and great atmosphere.  Just an FYI for parents out there. Bring your own high chair/booster chair as they do not have any."}
{"text":"Celebrated my brother's birthday here just over a week ago and had a great meal. The dishes were inventive and delicious, but I almost didn't give 4 stars due to the meal having been quite salty! Maybe it was an off night because the quality of the food was otherwise top notch. The highlights for me were the broccoli, cod and short rib dishes. I cannot eat seafood so missed out on all that, but the table loved the shrimp-topped dumplings! The desserts were excellent overall, but the crust on the rhubarb tart was a feat to break up (even with a knife!). Bring strong arms/hands if you are thinking of giving it a try! The sundae was amazing, and very generous; you could definitely split it at least two ways.  Relaxed vibe, worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My wife has serious food allergies. When we informed the waitress of the specific allergens before ordering, she was cavalier about the matter and seemed uninterested in the details of the specific food allergies. After taking our paper note to the kitchen which detailed the allergies, the waitress came back and told us that everything was fine. But after eating a few bites of the lobster--the ingredients of which were all but clear to the waitress-- my wife had an allergic reaction, which intensified after we left the restaurant and resulted in a hospital visit. Fortunately the new CHUM medical centre is located a short cab ride from Cadet.  If you or someone you are dining with has a serious food allergy, I simply can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had a recommendation from a friend to try this place since it's the sister restaurant of Bouillon Bilk which is one of my favourite fine dining restaurants in Montreal. It is more affordable and the dishes are a less complex but still well composed.   The menu items are divided by different categories such as vegetables dishes, seafood dishes, and meat & poultry dishes. I recommend getting maybe 4-6 dishes to share between two people. The portions are rather small so be prepared to order more than 4 dishes if needed.   My most memorable dish was the lobster salad. My friend and I felt that the beef tartare was good but on the sweeter side of what we are use to. The broccoli and spätzle dish was really delicious!   The chocolate cake was pretty big and reminded me of a Black Forest cake but with raspberry. So make sure to have room for that if you plan on ending your meal with that!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience eating here!! It was great!!! We ordered almost everything on the menu and we were not disappointed!!! The oysters were fresh and delicious! The pork shoulder was great as well as the chicken wings!!! We really enjoyed the fluke and beef tartar!! We even ordered a bunch of desserts and we're disappointed when they were done!! Would definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"Food here was excellent and extremely reasonable as other reviewers have said. We had focaccia with a tomato sauce, the broccoli which other reviewers have described, roasted mushrooms with shallots and greens, veal with chorizo and pearl onions, and a black pudding with celery root and apples. The black pudding was probably the most interesting dish--- it was in balls, rather than in sausage like I've normally seen it and had celery root noodles with a Dijon remoulade. Everything was excellent, but the vegetables were better than the meats overall. We had a pecan tart with coffee ice cream for dessert that was phenomenal.  Some reviewers have complained about the size of the portions. I felt like these were normal small plates portions, but I did think that the sizing was uneven. For example, my husband couldn't finish all of the veal, but I ate all of the black pudding myself and was still hungry (so I ate some of the veal).  Also, for a wine bar, I was not super impressed with the wine selection. I was served red wine in a white wine glass, and it seemed like there were more roses on the menu than reds or whites, which was especially odd since we went in January.   Overall, while I would probably give this 4.5 stars because of the wine, I'm rounding up because the food was so good!"}
{"text":"Un essai parce qu'il était près de l'hôtel. Une excellente surprise. On ne va pas là pour s'empiffrer mais déguster!  Dauphinoise, gnudi, bavette de veau, tartare de boeuf. Tout était apprêté à souhait.   Bel ambiance, nous étions deux collègues de travail, j'y retournerai sûrement mais la prochaine fois en amoureux. À mettre sur la liste des restaurants raffiné et abordable."}
{"text":"An amazing experience! Everything was delicious and plated beautifully. Service was perfect. Friendly waitress and well-timed dish placement. Standout plates were the broccoli, beets, and salmon. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great find. The portions were bigger than most small plates.  Go for the focaccia, followed by two plates per rather than the suggested three. Great cocktails, wine list. Some of the dishes were doing a little too much; the beef would have been better over simple potato or polenta."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in place des arts area. Service very on point. Highly recommend the mushroom dish and the duck. Would go back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, service and vibe. One of the best restaurants I've been to in Montreal.  You have to try the chicken wings and the fluke tartar. And for desert the banana split.  Amazing."}
{"text":"I love Bouillon Bilk and came to check Cadet when I heard they were sister restaurans. Did not regret at all, very nice restaurant! The menu is made of small plates. We were a party of 2, ordered 5 dishes and it was perfect. The food was very good, but the quality of service and the ambiance were the most impressive aspects of the evening. I love the way the ingredients blend together.....My favorite dishes were the Gnudi and the liver mousse. Oh and the bread pudding was also spectacular!"}
{"text":"Bonne bouffe prix ok bon service. La pieuvre et les dumplig étaient excellent. Le tonic maison ok sans plus."}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, nettement plus décontractée que le Bouillon Bilk  Les prix sont abordables (je ne peux pas vous préciser le montant exact, j'étais invitée...), excellent service  Les assiettes sont petites mais les portions restent généreuses. J'ai bien aimé le dumpling, le broccoli et le sundae  J'ai pigé dans l'assiette de celui qui m'accompagnait. J'ai bien aimé ses lupinis et olives, sa salade au homard avec pommes de terre et citronnelle avec ail rôti et oignons caramélisés. Son foie de volaille aux morilles sur pain de maïs étaient très bons tout comme ses fraises au poivre flambées à la vodka sur sablé breton recouvert d'une crème glacée aux pistaches."}
{"text":"I really like the restaurant. It's mostly the after-work crowd. Food was fresh, original and delicious. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"During a road trip from Boston, decided on a whim to come for dinner on an earlier Friday evening. Was able to get a table for two without reservations and with a little time restraint. Chose to sit at the beautiful long bar with intimate lighting. Excellent and knowledgeable service.  Do not typically enjoy trendy small-plate joints as the food is often too contrived and overrated. Cadet is an exception with hardly any missteps. Panzanella takes the incredibly fresh and ripe seasonable sliced heirloom tomatoes mixed with a garlic aioli that is not heavy and whipped delicately next to the vinaigrette dressing. Crispy croutons to pair.   Thinly sliced duck breast wrapped with cucumber lends an Asian flare with sesame cashews and pear on top. Perfect little bites. Craving more. On the Asian theme, highly recommend the pork dumplings with creamy shrimp salad. In your own kitchen, this probably would never work but Cadet takes two dishes that have nothing to do with each other and marry with flavor and texture. The dumpling dough is thick but not gummy, helpful to keep the pork intact as you take a bite. The soy/vinegar-based sauce is slightly strong mixed with the mayo-based shrimp salad.  Finish the meal with ouppet. Malomars on another level."}
{"text":"At last the solution to the eternal dilemma of where to grab a bite before a show at Place des Arts!  Only a five minute walk away is this little gem.  The entrance is unassuming and the decor is minimalist, all the better to let the food shine!  Went with my niece before going to the Book of Mormon.  Service was efficient and friendly.  It's a small plates style, great for sharing.  We started with an excellent beef tartare, a nice generous portion.  Also the crab,  probably the weakest dish, a little watery and lacking in flavour, but still ok.  Then the beets and mushroom which were delicious, and the octopus which was perfectly cooked.  Five plates left us too full for dessert.    As it was the first warm day of spring, we busted out a very quaffable rose to celebrate!"}
{"text":"Literally the place to go if you want to take your taste buds on a journey! Decided to meet up with some friends for a nice meal when I was in town. My friend suggested Cadet.   There is no sign outside of the restaurant so its easy to miss. The restaurant decor creates a nice ambiance and the staff is extremely welcoming/professional. The menu comprises of many small plates. We ordered a bunch to share including some of the specials of the night. The waitress also had brought out a complimentary dish from the kitchen which made us feel special.   Will definitely be coming again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Such a lovely set of circumstances led me to Cadet. It started several years ago, wherein I was destined to come to Montreal. That's beyond the scope of this review, but important to note in the story. With that as context, it seemed like such good fortune for me to have dinner here two weeks ago.  I was road wary, having waited several years to visit Montreal, followed by several hours waiting for a delayed plane. By the time I arrived it was dark and late but the weather was absolutely perfect. After checking into the hotel, I headed out to finally, FINALLY really arrive.  Hunger took over my mind, despite the lights, people, and energy on the street. Not two blocks from my hotel on Saint-Laurent, I fired up the Yelp app and it pointed me right in the direction of Cadet. Another block and I was there, my eyes confirming what the app was saying: it's completely underspoken, soft, cozy, warm, and perfect.  I walked in and was greeted by a full house. At this point, it was after 10pm and people were sipping their wine and laughing, and in that soft light it seemed like there was no place else I should be. As a solo diner I opted to sit at the bar. The delightful bartender (Katherine? Oh dear... I have forgotten her name) took really good care of me, and helped me feel right at home. She helped with a few recommendations and then let me be. But was polite in conversation, even to a guy like me who wasn't drinking.  Broccoli with spaëtzle with a creamy schmear of I dunno what? Yes, beautiful. But that beautiful eggplant, served sliced the long way, was amazing. Just right. Just the right size. It was a special that night, but if they've got it, you need it.   They looked to have a great wine selection and know their way around a drink. I didn't get dessert, but now kinda wish I had. If you're looking for a great place to share a meal with friends, and especially with a date, this would certainly fit the bill. Great smaller plates, drinks -- the whole thing was a perfect welcome to years of pent-up desire to visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing food! They serve small shared plates here but they're definitely on the larger side. We got the focaccia, beef tartare, oyster mushrooms, cod croquettes, lamb meatballs and duck confit. Our favorites were definitely the tartare and duck. Would highly recommend both. The ambiance was great and the food was very reasonably priced. also the service was fast!"}
{"text":"Came for a late night dinner around 10p on a Sunday night. It's incredible and very convenient for us tourists to have nice dinner places like this that are open so late!   Since I was on the mend from a bout of food poisoning we ordered only a few dishes to share -octopus, cod croquettes, fluke ceviche, watercress salad, and beef tartare. I enjoyed all the dishes despite my stomach troubles.  The cocktails were also very yummy - we had the last word and an old fashioned, both nicely made (not too sweet and with a good kick of alkie just how we like it).  Service was great and I would definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Simple menu with a decent but not overwhelming selection which I like. The tartare is one of the best I've had in the city. Great level of spice(ask for it to be spicy... you won't regret).  The 2nd course was cod and it wasn't as good as I would have liked. Overall a good experience nonetheless and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excelent cuisine! I tried the chef's suggestion of the day with a medium iqa beer... wonderful flavors!"}
{"text":"Menu simple, mais très diverse, avec des options pour plaire à tous. Bon service, ambiance agréable. Restaurant idéal pour déguster tout en partageant."}
{"text":"Fantastic and attentive service. The food was great, beautiful plates, all around great. The radish dish was the highlight of the meal with the crispy chicken skin perfectly complementing the radishes. Definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Great find! After a long two days of traveling all I wanted was a nice environment, good food, and a good cocktail: and I was very satisfied at Cadet. Service was wonderful, welcoming and helpful. Food and drinks came out faster than I expected and everything was delicious. I had the beef tartare and fingerling potatoes, and a mezcal drink that was amazing."}
{"text":"A shockingly delicious restaurant experience that we stumbled upon our first night in Montreal. Coming from NYC, we were amazed by how affordable everything was. $14 CAD for the duck confit which easily would have cost $35 in new york. we got the Beets (one of the best flavor combinations we've ever eaten), Broccoli (incredibly delicious ajd comforting), and duck (rich, hearty, and so so good). The cocktails were also incredible.   The only downside would be that the wine was underwhelming (the red wine was also served ice cold which was strange) and the beer selection was minimal. But other than that, a delicious and homey spot well gladly come back to before we leave."}
{"text":"Simple 2 page tapas style menu for lunch. Flavourful, well priced dishes served quickly. Average wine list and no exterior signs. Would love to try them out for supper."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Great atmosphere, doesn't look amazing when you are walking around but stumble upon it and get a classy gem with great food. Get the beef, calamari. Won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and everything was soooo good. Food is served tapas style and you order 2-3 items per person.  Highly recommend the octopus and Brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my husband and I have high standards when it comes to food. We live in NYC, and I was raised by French parents. I have a sensitive palette :) So on our first night visiting Montréal, we naturally decided to have dinner at Bouillon Bilk-a very highly rated restaurant close to our hotel. Unsurprisingly, the place was full and we were told that without a reservation the wait could be an hour. Fortunately, the host suggested we check out their sister restaurant, aptly named Cadet (which means second child in the family for my non-francophone readers). We shrugged and figured why not? So we walked the one block to Cadet- and WOW. One of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had.   Our waiter, Arnaud, was very friendly, efficient,  and answered all of our questions. He even gave us several suggestions re events going on in Montreal to check out- which is more than I can say for our hotel's front desk. The food was excellent -they pair ingedients that you wouldnt normally see together but all the dishes work- for example strawberry with pepper, fluke tartar with soybeans, terrine with pistachios... The beef tartar was my favorite dish, and the marinated beef was so light and tender. The raw oysters came with 3 separate sauce jars- strawberry, lemon and spicy. Each dish was presented and explained in detail when it came to our table--5 star service but with a comfortable, not stuffy atmosphere. Prices are also very reasonable. I was shocked to find out theyd only been open for 3 days- normally at this nacent stage even the best restaurants are still trying to figure themselves out and dont really have their sh*t together. I even spoke with Elise, the manager who was friendly and very open to feedback. My one critique is that the host of Bouillon Bilk had no information about Cadet other than this location and we informed Elise of this. Ive always wanted to write a Yelp review but aleays procrastinated. When I saw that Cadet had no reviews yet, I figured this would be a great way to break my Yelp cherry."}
{"text":"I love that it was open really late! The vibe is definitely trendy. Basically, if youre looking for a great place with great food for a night out or for a date, this will 100% do the trick"}
{"text":"We spent 5 days in Montreal and had food in this restaurant twice. The chef really has very good taste for food and the waitress were so nice. Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"A tapas restaurant near Chinatown! Atmosphere is not bad! Food Presentation is nice however I found that the foods overall are a bit salty..."}
{"text":"Cadet was one of the new places on my list to try. Bouillon Bilk, their sister restaurant, is unbelievably good so I was hoping for more of the same with their new spot.  We made a reservation for two but turns out we didn't need it. When we arrived on an early Sunday evening, we were one of the first people there. Cbear was super worried that we would be under dressed (considering how fancy Bouillon Bilk is) but Cadet seems to have a much more relaxed vibe to it. Not to say it isn't gorgeous, it is, it's just more chill. Think casual chic.  Our waitress was great and service was excellent. We sat by the window to people watch the night away. Man, Montreal has some interesting characters, especially in this neck of the woods.  Menu - clean, simple, just like the restaurant itself. We were told that the menu starts on the lighter side of things and gradually moves to heavier, stronger tasting dishes. Click here and here if you want a closer look.  It's all about small plates here. Our waitress recommended that each person order 2-3 plates. The way they brought out the dishes was well paced and thoughtful. Hope you like sharing because this is what differentiates them from BB.  - Cocktail and cider - I didn't take any notes on the drinks but they were both good.  - Scallop ceviche ($18.00) - with cherry pepper and cucumbers. Holy crap, this was fantastic. The presentation is breathtaking - it comes out on massive shell and underneath, there's about 6 pieces of fresh, succulent scallops. Came with a side of taro chips. Perfect vehicle to make mini scallop chip bites.  - Dumplings ($16.00) - interesting to see dumplings on the menu. Very Asian influenced. Shrimp on top and pork dumplings underneath. Not quite sure what they're trying to do with the pairing - the shrimp had a creamy sauce while the dumplings had a sweet soy based sauce. Eaten separately, it was fine.  - Lobster ($16.00) - with potato, lemongrass and mayo. The lobster was tasty although there could have been more chunks. The lemongrass foam was the most interesting part of this dish.  - Beef short rib ($16.00) - with avocado and sprouts. The sauce rub was sweet and sticky. I liked the use of avocado in this dish. I would never have thought to pair the two together.  - Ouppet ($3.00) - I've never had a real Whippet before (sorry, my childhood lacked in the junk food category) so I can't compare it to the OG. I wasn't sure if I was going to be a fan of the ouppet but it grew on me. These are made in house. Marshmallow on the inside and chocolate outside. Probably worth a try for nostalgic sake.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal. When we went (back in June), they had just opened so I'm sure they've fine tuned and tightened up the menu since then."}
{"text":"Wonderful tapas/small plates eatery off the main road. The look from outside is easy to pass by, however its got a nice setting inside along with attentive service and a varied menu. I'm a vegetarian and was able to find great options (special thanks to a English menu!) that were absolutely delicious and well presented. The wine selection was robust. So glad we stumbled on this location just prior to theater so they totally understood the need for speed w/out sacrificing quality."}
{"text":"A bit too oily for my taste. But the food was pretty good. Like their chocolate cake."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what any establishment ought to be if they are to receive a 5 star rating. I'd give them more stars if I could. I'm a tourist, walked in and was promptly seated. Felix at the bar is the man. Incredibly helpful, and the food was outstanding. Everyone works with a smile. I'll be back.."}
{"text":"Second time here. Server was the same as last time and just as lovely as we remembered. Food came quickly. Favourite dish- the tartare. I would skip the fingerling potatoes."}
{"text":"Cadet is the perfect spot for a birthday celebration. Modern, comfortable, not too noisy, dim lights, but it has kind of energetic atmosphere. The service was perfect, attentive, non intrusive, timely.   The food was a pleasure, ordered by preference follow my favourite dishes. The gnudi are must have: light and puffy, the squash sauce with pumpkin seeds and bacon made the dish heavenly. The arctic char blini are magic and the octopus was cooked to perfection. I stole a piece of pastrami and a potato with chimichurri sauce from the plates of the birthday girl and they were yummi. The watercress salad is fine if you need something green to chew on, the combination with endive and feta cheese was enjoyable. The only disappointment is the fluke ceviche, the spicy mayonnaise simply eliminated the taste of the fish, which I find essential in ceviche. My dessert pick is the cheese cake.   We had a glimpse at the kitchen from our table and observed a structured well organized production of wonderful dishes that were subject to strict quality control. Besides the good food Cadet has an exemplary beverage list. All that contributes to a fun time with good friends, making it perfect restaurant for a special occasion! Nice choice NLM!"}
{"text":"I had walked by this mysterious restaurant so many times on my way to dance class. It was always full house, but there was no name on the restaurant door and people that were having dinner there seemed so relaxed and comfortable, as if I was peaking through the windows of somedy's house. I recently learned that this restaurant was Cadet, the sister restaurant of Bouillon Bilk that I love. I knew I had to try eat, better sooner than later.  The dishes are in the form of tapas, meant to share. They usually recommend 3 to 4 per person. We were 4 and we got 10 in total and it was just enough. We got: The watercress salad, the grilled octopus, the cod, the calmars,the pastrami, the broccoli, the beet salad, the mousse de foie, veal bavette and the lemon cake.  All the dishes were extremely tasty and very well executed. My favourites were the watercress salad, the cod, the grilled octopus and the lemon cake (which was simple but yet perfect to end the meal). Bill ended being $33 per person without the drinks. Service was very low-key but very efficient and on point. The ambiance is contemporary and cozy despite the simplistic decor. It was just right. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"D'abord les fleurs!  Très belle sélection de vins d'importation privée, commençant à environ 50$ la bouteille.  Belle sélection de bières également.  De quoi ravir les palais curieux! Ensuite, ma foi, la bavette de veau était excellente, une tendreté à couper à la fourchette.  Ensuite le pot... Les 5 autres plats que nous avons commandés (c'est une formule de type tapas à partager) étaient plutôt décevants.  Une absence totale de finesse dans les saveurs, celles-ci étant le plus souvent massacrées par une sauce criarde qui enterrait le goût des aliments.  Les patates baignaient littéralement dans la mayonnaise, les accras de morue étaient accompagnés d'une sauce trop sucrée, cousine huppée d'une mayonnaise-ketchup, etc.  En somme un restaurant qui n'est pas vraiment mauvais, mais qui est loin d'être bon.  Et à 100$ par personne, incluant un vin parmi les moins chers (60$) et le service, on s'attend à un peu mieux.   Et puis, si c'est bien agréable, dès son arrivée de se voir offrir le choix entre une eau plate ou une eau gazéifiée maison, c'est beaucoup moins agréable de se rendre compte qu'on vous charge 8$ pour cette bagatelle sur votre facture.  Une radinerie qui frôle la malhonnêteté."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant is beautiful, nice place to take someone special on a date. The lighting gives it a romantic feel to it.   This place is open late, good for small dishes but if you're coming for a full dinner, this is not the place. There is not much that will be filling. Their tapas are extremely small and pricey for the portion.    However, they have a special menu that they don't tell people about. You can order 1kg boneless short ribs for $100 or 1.2kg for $120. The portion was smaller than expected. We ordered this and shared among a group of people. It was not filling at all. It would be good for 2-3 people I think. However, the flavour was good though.  Maybe if shared with a smaller group it would be filling. But for $100-$120. It's kinda not worth it. You're better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great spot. Service was outstanding, our server gave great, detailed recommendations. All the dishes were excellent, in particular the fried whole sea bass and the octopus. Will definitely be back for special occasions."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Casual chic, gorgeous set up and a friendly atmosphere that will make you want to spend hours sitting at the bar. Le Cadet is just a few doors from its big bro Le Bouillon Bilk and they are both lovely yet very different. Cadet is a bit more relaxed, offering small plates to share with your date, which are often served in funky ways. The wines were dead on, prices are super honest. Will be back !!"}
{"text":"On the spectrum of \"small plates\" these were definitely on the larger size so, comparatively, a great value for the price. We ended up ordering seven items and were super stuffed by the end of the meal. We began with the focaccia & a fried zucchini/baba ganoush appetizer. Next came the fingerling potatoes, which were okay, but could have used some salt, and the brussel sprouts, which came in a sauce that reminded me of American Orange Chicken. Tasty, but once I thought of the orange chicken comparison I couldn't stop. The next round was the oyster mushrooms, which were topped with some filler lettuce, and the smoked pork with escargots, super salty fried gnocchi and lemon confit. To finish we chose the bread pudding, which thankfully wasn't very big because we were so full.   Highlights: Bread pudding, great wine by the glass pricing"}
{"text":"Wow! Service impeccable et attentionné, les plats avec des saveurs inattendues et tellement agréables, la pieuvre par exemple, le tartare de boeuf, la salade de concombre, etaient exquis! Le dessert, pouding au pain délicieux, gâteau au fromage sans suprise. Un dessert a base de fruits aurait été très apprécié. L'addition a prix doux, pour l'originalité et le plaisir de découvrir des saveurs, le meilleur rapport qualité /prix qui soit."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this restaurant because I love Bouillon Bilk. Sadly it did not meet my expectations. The portions are small and I only fully enjoyed four out of the seven dishes that we shared. Maybe we should have ordered more plates for three people. The waiter recommended two to three plates per person.  We started with the oysters. It came with three types of mignonette... a strawberry one , a piri piri one and a lemon one. Then we had the fluke tartare which I really didn't like. It had bean sprouts and raspberry. I didn't like the taste of the fish on its own and I actually liked the taste of the fish better with the raspberry. My favorite dish was the beef tartare. If they had a bigger size I would go back and just order that. I also really enjoyed the pork and shrimp dumplings. There was sour cream on top.  I also liked the duck breast with cucumber and cashews but my two brothers didn't. One brother really enjoyed the broccoli. I've never had broccoli like that before... there was labneh (yogurt) , pistachio and spätzle (egg noodles) . This dish to me tasted like those cheesy goldfish crackers!! We also had the lobster potatoe salad which was good but not memorable."}
{"text":"I came here on one of my first nights in Montreal, and was so impressed with this cosy little restaurant.  My partner and I shared bread and a few small plates---  - Focaccia - Extremely yummy! The cheesy crust was a great touch.  - Marinated salmon - Great dish. All the taste of a lox bagel, minus the carbs.   - Octopus with chickpeas - succulent, delicious.   - Chicken thighs with piri piri sauce - The chicken was moist and tender, and the piri piri sauce reminded me of a mix between Thai peanut and BBQ sauce.   - Smoked pork, escargots, gnocchi - Skip this one! This is the only dish that wasn't a home run. The escargot and smoked pork were fine, but the gnocchi were dense and hard-- not light and airy like I expect gnocci to be. The parmesan cheese in this dish was too sharp and overwhelming, overpowering the delicate flavors.  The small plates are definitely large in size. We selected 5, but could have gotten away with 4. We also opted for dessert - a pasty with ice cream that was absolutely delicious.  Cadet is definitely worth a trip. The food is outstanding, and the price is extremely reasonable for the quality and portion size."}
{"text":"Ouvert depuis 2016, dans le Quartier des Spectacles, le petit frère du Bouillon Bilk est vraiment une bonne adresse pour les amateurs de bonne bouffe/vins. Moderne et élégant, le Cadet propose des tapas à partager, de plus, il est ouvert tard (1AM). Les prix sont abordables;  (ex: tartare de boeuf 15$ / brocolis 10$ / canard confit 14$...) Tout ce que nous avons pris (6 plats/1 dessert/1 bouteille) était tout simplement succulent. Les prix pour les vins sont aussi abordables, notre bouteille était ( Syrah 2015 / 48$). Excellent service de la part de la serveuse. Seul bémol, un peu bruyant, arrivez tôt et pensez à réservez, ça se remplit vite. Facture total avec taxes/service = 167,17$. Assez raisonnable, j'ai déjà vu pire .... Je reviendrai sûrement dans ce restaurant pour passer une agréable soirée et bien manger/boire au centre-ville/QdS.   5/5 visité en décembre 2017"}
{"text":"J'adore. Le Cadet est plus sympa et accessible que son frère aîné le Bouillon Bilk, tout en étant aussi savoureux. On commande plein d'assiettes et on partage, en arrosant avec le vin vendu sur place. Je me souviendrai du reuben délicieusement gras et fumé et sa crème de raifort, des rates-mayo épicée, du ceviche saupoudré d'ail frit. La présentation est pas toujours au niveau du goût, pas grave. Petite déception sur les desserts, le sorbet laissait imaginer une mangue trop mûre, et un gâteau au citron pas si fou que ça. La prochaine fois je m'arrête au salé."}
{"text":"Wednesday night for our second snack meal. We sat at the bar. Bartender gave great service. Lady friend had a vodka drink (beet it) I had a glass of gamay went well with our small plates. Started with the fresh cheese plate. The bread was toasted to perfection with the slightest hint of char, cheese and tapenade were great and the best honey drizzled over the top. Then followed with incredibly cheesy cauliflower and pork belly. I'd say you should have these in this order."}
{"text":"Cadet was a great couples date night! We are so excited to have reviewed this restaurant this week! You can check out our favorite dishes & photo's on our blog: http://eatsandtravels.com/home/2016/10/8/cadet"}
{"text":"Flavourful and savoury.  That's how I would describe our recent experience at Cadet. I love trying out new places, but I think Cadet just made it onto my list of restaurants to keep for return visits and out of town guests.   We were there on a weeknight and the restaurant wasn't extremely busy and thus not too noisy. The service was attentive and friendly.   We were told to pick 2-3 plates each and we decided to go with most of the waitress' suggestions.   The foccacia bread came highly recommended and it's a great way to start the evening. It comes with a spicy mayonnaise that just opens up your palate and prepares you for the rest of the meal.   Next, we tried the cod nuggets, grilled calamari salad and grilled mushrooms. The fried cod nuggets were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I loved how well it paired with the bed of pickled coleslaw it was sitting on. The calamari salad had an Asian twist to it that I enjoyed, but I didn't enjoy the fishy aftertaste as much. The grilled mushroom was my least favorite dish of the evening mainly because I didn't enjoy the cheese it was paired with.  The next 4 dishes we had were all amazing and I would suggest that you get them all, if your stomach allows for it. First, the smoked pork with snails and gnocchi was a very tasty dish sprinkled with pistachio. Next, the grilled octopus with fried chickpeas and hummus is also worth trying. My favorite of the evening was the broccoli and spaetzle. The crispy noodles hidden within the dish were a lovely surprise. Finally, the special of the night was a curry made of kabocha squash and udon. It was a little harder to split  but I would gladly order it again if it were available.   By then, we were stuffed, but we decided to split one last dessert and it was the best decision of the night. Their bread pudding is to die for! It is soaked in the most delicious caramel sauce and you really can't go wrong by finishing off the evening with such an amazing dessert.   I really enjoyed my evening at Cadet. I loved that the portions were sizeable and had we been four people, we could've still easily shared each plate and had a decent tasting portion. We tried 9 items on the menu and without drinks, spent about $30-35 before taxes. For the quality of food, I think the value was great. It wasn't too salty or greasy, but wonderfully flavorful.   I would happily return to Cadet in the future with friends and family."}
{"text":"Super service! J'avais réservé en mentionnant que j'étais végétalienne, ils m'ont accomodé et j'ai pu choisir entre 5-6 options. Super pour un restaurant d'omnivores! Mon copain a adoré le plat de porc fumé. Perso j'ai raffolé de l'assiette de pleurotes et le plat de quinoa fraises et menthe m'a beaucoup plu aussi! Il y a beaucoup de plats de viandes et fruits de mer qui ont l'air super appétissants! Vraiment intéressant comme place, et assez caché même si c'est sur St-Laurent. Ça vaut le détour et la recherche, en tous cas!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I would give this place 4.5. I just couldn't give it a five for food. Try the broccoli dish!"}
{"text":"Une belle découvertre.  Le p'tit frère du Bouillon Bilk n'a rien à envier à frangin...    Y sommes aller à six pour le souper et avons laissé carte blanche à notre serveuse (encore...) avec comme but de goûter au maximum de trucs sur le menu.  Croquettes de morue, clamars, tartare de boeuf, seviche de saumon et j'oublie...  Carte blanche sur le vin aussi.  Tout ça et environ 130$ pour deux.  Une aubaine.  Mais faut pas leur en parler..."}
{"text":"Delicious and great prices! We had the Guinea Fowell with pickled vegetables, Beef Tartare, Veal with Clams, and Pork with Edcargot. Each plate were so flavorful and well balanced. I wish they gave us more bread, else I would be licking the plate somewhere in the corner lol I know they make adjustments to there menu- I will definitely come back the next time I come visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"Amazing tapas style food! Potatoes with chimmichurri and the asian style sea bass were both unforgettable. Focaccia also homemade and perfect texture. Wonderful relaxing environment and great pace of dinner experience"}
