{"text":"Food is salty and overpriced. Correction, food is EXTREMELY salty, which, makes me wonder how FRESH it actually is...it most likely isn't. Meat was overcooked and I found their chicken breast specifically to be very gummy. Bread was stale.  Decent salads and desserts. The restaurant itself is quite nice and there's plenty of space, it's too bad the food doesn't even come close. Good for big groups though (in terms of settings/space only). Staff all look like they don't want to be there and if you have a question, prepare for some attitude."}
{"text":"A very rough start with a good end. We called the day prior to Easter(Sunday) to make a reservation, and asked if the 2 for $22 promo was still available, we were told it was available so we made our reservation for 6 pm. Arriving to the restaurant, the hostess told us the promo was not available on Holidays. I ask to see the manager. He went and check who took my reservation, and he said that she's been here for a WEEK, and that she never failed to say that the promo was not available on Holidays. On a nonchalant tone, he told us he cannot  make up for the mistake.  Since we had a reservation and its Easter, we decided to stay.  Our waiter was very nice and he made up for the manager's rudeness. He din't charge us for salad, was quick on answering many of our requests. I took the Tuna steak and asked for no sesame on it. The other waitress brought me the steak with sesame seeds and a second after he was there to take it away and bring me a brand new Tuna steak. The steak and ginger sauce was AMAZING. We took half of bottle of white wine to compliment our meal. Boyfriend had a Madison burger and mom a steak. Both very tasty and flavourful. For dessert, a Porto 10 year, a crème brulé for myself and a crème brulé cheesecake for my boyfriend.  The meals were amazing and all well done, the waiter's service 10/10 but all of it can't make up for the unavailability of the 2 for $22 which is the main appeal of Madison's, and the argument with the manager hence the 3 stars rating."}
{"text":"I have been at three Madisons and this one is definitely a couple of levels below the other two.  Although it has nice decor and a huge terrace, the food leaves a lot to be desired.  My friend always orders the chicken strips and found the one here to be soggy and tasteless.  I have had the aihi tuna at all three locations and this one was definitely sub par.   To top it off,  the two times I went, we got space cadets for waitresses.   Pleasant, but not exactly knowing what they should be doing."}
{"text":"Went for the recent special offer, two dine for $22. Reminds me of several American chains, the ribs were nice and the small portion was sufficient for us to bring home a doggie bag. We had an emergency during dinner that required us to finish swiftly and pay. The waiter was prompt and helpful in the matter. Service was efficient. It appears that the price deal did bring in a larger crowd. Great when the deal is on!"}
{"text":"For a couple years we have placed the Keg restaurant as our favourite place to eat dinner and celebrate occasions! Well for my 30th birthday dinner weekend we decided to try Madison's. We can honestly say that it ranks up there with the Keg, if not better! The staff again were so friendly and attentive without being too much in your face.. our waiter ensured we were taken care of completely, and the foodddddd! Gimme a minute.. sigh   I decided to go for the salmon with a white wine and cream sauce, with garlic mash, and a mocktail strawberry daiquiri! The salmon fell apart it was Devine! The garlic mash quite literally, melted in my mouth I don't know if I've ever experienced mash so nice and I'm a heavy potato critic! Trust me! Now the daiquiri holy good god!! For a cocktail that had no alcohol in it, it was the nicest I have ever ever had. Even my fiancé was disgusted he tried it, as he didn't want his beer anymore then! Imagine how nice it would be with alcohol too. Yum! My fiancé also ordered an old fashioned with a strip of bacon in it, which I found odd but he thoroughly enjoyed it ha! Overall such a lovely evening! The man at the desk said they have locations in Miami and New York too and hope to expand! I'm praying they do, if not I'll have to come back!"}
{"text":"I like to say I know good BBQ.  Is this place the best? no.  But dollar for value and taste.  Awesome.  I was surprised Canadia had a decent BBQ spot.  I had Grilled Shrimp, baby back ribs, and the clam chowder.  Mind you, their sunday special you get a rack of baby backs, fries AND coleslaw for $11!!  The ribs are definitely steamed cooked for that fine \"fall off the bone experience.\"  Which does change the texture of the meat you bite into, and gives it a weird water smell.  But, overall it had a good char and a really good sauce. I prefer a that slow cooked authentic BBQ style, but whatever. It was so easy to eat with a knife and fork.  The coleslaw was pretty good; it's finely chopped into little bits.  And it lacks that overwhelming mayo taste most cheapy coleslaw tends to taste like.  The grilled shrimp was pretty amazing.  It's served with lemon and butter.  I personally went without the butter because the shrimp itself had enough flavor.  It's a well seasoned prawn, with a light char.  Enough to keep the shrimp juicy.  When you bite into it, it has that pop.  Pretty good. I was pleased.  The clam chowder was a treat as well.  Small tid bits of potato, veggies and clam.  All in a creamy, not too thick broth.  It was so good.  No fishy after taste, and the clams weren't rubbery either.  I really liked it. I compared it to chowder i've had in both boston and san francisco.  My overall experience was pleasant:  from the moment you walk in the friendly faces greet you and sit you. Service was quick, courteous and our server communicated in English pretty well. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Je n'aime normalement pas les menus ' de game ' lors des événements au centre Bell, mais je dois dire que celui du Madison's est vraiment pas mal !!   1. Choix d'entrées multiples incluant soupe, salade, bouchées frites, etc.  2. Choix de repas variés et pour tous les goûts (viande, salades, ribs, poulet, poisson) 3. Portions généreuses  4. Prix sans compromis (45$ pour une entrée, un plat et un drink) 5. Parlant de drinks, ils ont une alléchante carte de martinis colorés et sucrés, ainsi que le fameux dry. 6. Le service était... digne d'un grand hôtel. Vraiment, impressionnant.   Une bonne surprise en somme !!! J'ai pris une grosse salade, je ne me permet pas de juger la qualité de la viande, ce sera pour une autre fois !"}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way to Montreal. Baby back ribs and burger were very good. Waitresses were friendly and nice. Had a great time."}
{"text":"So, my client in Montreal decided to take a New Yorker to a place called \"Madison's NY Bar & Grill\". I knew from the beginning that this wasn't going to be a 5 Yelp experience, and it wasn't. I'll keep this one brief:  Restaurant: + & - It's a chain, I loathe chain restaurants but it was large, clean and the staff was friendly.  Service: + We had a really quirky waiter whom at first, confused us if he was a man or a woman. His wack-a-doodle hairstyle, his feminine ways of speaking and conducting business had us quite confused...however upon further visual inspection of his chest area, led us to believe he was a male. With that said, he was still a fairly efficient waiter handling our party of 10  Food: - I stuck with a grilled chicken salad as everything else on the menu seemed unappealing to this New Yorker. It's not any different than any other chain restaurant and the calorie counts on the dishes they're serving are quite high  Overall, this seems to be a very popular spot for the local professionals and gets quite busy during the lunch hour but I don't think it's worth a re-visit upon my next trip to the beautiful city of Montreal.  THIS has been a review by Gaurav"}
{"text":"Solid steak house. The cocktails were a little heavy on sweet and light in kick, but dinner was really satisfying. For a chain, they were very accommodating of a food allergy."}
{"text":"Une belle surprise. Une carte des vins assez intéressante. Portions très généreuses. Et j'insiste, portions très généreuses....  Je ne pourrais vous dire le prix puisque j'étais invitée. Par contre, je peux vous parler du service rapide, courtois, des grosses portions, mes filets de poulet étaient croustillants à souhait, grosse assiette de frite, salade généreuse, sauce miel dijon goûteuse  Voilà!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice now once in the summer on a calm night and service was okay nothing special. How ever I went and not only was our waiter rude he places my drink on my cell phone case and it almost fell... I ordered a old fashion which is a pretty easy drink he brought me a package of sugar said that it would make it better. I don't even know how that's acceptable Lol. Our food arrived in 2 minutes and was disgusting our waiter was terrible and I will never return."}
{"text":"I've had some really good meals here in Montreal, but not at Madison's.  It was a long day in the office, so really wasn't in the mood for a steak and I love red meat.  Tired, away from home I guess I just wanted something comforting and not too heavy since it was already after 8 pm.    I ordered a NYC baked potato - sour cream, garlic, bacon and avocado (still can't figure out what those toppings have to do with New York City) and a side salad with a ginger lime dressing.  My co worker had a club sandwich and some spinach dip with chips.  The food arrived in short order - not even 1/2 the tables were seated so it should have come out of the kitchen fast.  The potato had been in hot hold for a bit too long as the inside had begun to turn color a little.  The taste was ok, and the toppings were sparingly adorned on top of the slightly split open potato.  The salad was dressed, dressing was nice, but it was just romaine, a few scattered julienned carrots and a couple pieces of purple cabbage.  Nothing special, just meh.  Here is the shining star of this restaurant...our waiter!  He was attentive, oh so happy to have us in his section, not offended that we were not ordering the 16 oz T-bone and said \"let me just read the specials off to you in case you change your mind.\"  Hello....he was nothing short of stellar!  There are several Madison's around Montreal...so I don't know if this particular location was having an off night, or the quality of the food just sucks overall."}
{"text":"If I would pick one sentence to describe this pathetic establishment it would be:  \"Shitty diner that wishes it was the Keg\"  And I dislike the Keg.  My soup was some unsalted greasy muck scoped out of a barrel, my \"Ahi tuna\" was probably some low grade piece of Metro bought crap (no sear/looked boiled, fatty tissue everywhere, I had a hard time cutting into it...Scary stuff...), certainly NOT Ahi tuna. My husband's salad was the saddest store-bought vinaigrette covered chopped up iceberg junk I've ever seen in a restaurant that charges the prices this one does, his baked potato came with sour cream...yes that's all, and his steak was an under-salted unappetizing mistake that looked like it should be served in an old-folks home (sorry elderly people but most of you eat rather bland looking things).   How do they justify the pricing? By walking around like they're fancypants of course, in their try-hard decor.   Sorry, but you'd have to serve actual edible food for me to be impressed. Gross. Next!  P.S. I feel sorry for everyone who gets dragged out here on business meetings/meals...REALLY sorry."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal, we were walking back to our hotel and looking for something to eat. We walked in and the hostess was very quick to seat us. While it is very nice inside, I didn't get to see the whole place. Our waitress was helpful but repeatedly spoke to us in French and then would back track when we would say we do not speak French or understand. I waited for my water to be filled up and it never did. My boyfriend and I both got a chicken entrée and some type of vegetable side. We had no complaints regarding the food. I think we just had a long day and were tired, maybe my review would have been different if we weren't. All in all, it was alright."}
{"text":"Madisons deserves more than it's current rating gives it!  A group of friends were in the Hochelaga area playing archery tag at Combat d'Archers (fun place, see my review). We looked for a place to go for dinner but, not surprisingly, there wasn't much available. Aside for a few French bistros, nothing seemed suitable for 16 people.   We landed on Madisons, which wasn't our first choice since it was likely the same boring food as every other big-chain sit-down restaurant. The place was full but, since we had made a reservation the day before, we were seated immediately. It took the waiter a little while to get to us, but the service was excellent after that. The food was great, beyond our expectations, and the portions were quite large. All in all, excellent value!  A few tips: -- Go easy on the appetizers. They are huge, as are the mains. You'll fill up quickly.  -- There are a handful of \"special\" cocktails. They were tasty, but they were light on the alcohol and lacked anything special. -- Definitely try a beef dish. Madisons prides itself on only serving Creekstone Farm black angus beef. I'm definitely not a snob when it comes to meat, but the prime rib sandwich was delicious!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The first time I went, the calamari was great and the steak was decent. I went again during lunch time and the calamari was too greasy and the breading was falling apart. The burger was overcooked and dry while the fries were undercooked. The waitress was very professional and offered us coffee and dessert for the mishap but the blueberry cheesecake was a disappointment again. They need to establish a standard between the cooks."}
{"text":"Needed a restaurant with parking after visiting the Biodôme. Salads were fresh but lackluster. My prime rib ai jus sandwich had a bizarre touch of nutmeg in it.  Daughter's chicken fingers came with a pile of French fries that strongly resembled McDonald's. Wife's burger was nothing special. Service was rather slow, and the waitress vaporized the moment she dropped off the check, so I had to wait to pay. The location is convenient and they have off the street parking. We loved the décor. Just didn't have the best meal."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant with some doubt since I come from Dallas, Texas where they know how do a steak.  To my surprise, these guys really know how to do a steak!  To top it off, the rest of the meal was just as good.  Giving me an awesome experience!!!    Give these guys a shot...you won't be disappointed!!!  :)"}
{"text":"I had the grilled Atlantic salmon with rice and Cesar salad. Classic meal. The salmon was perfectly cooked with a light almost candy-like outside that locked in the moisture and flavour. It melted in my mouth and exploded with the goodness of salmon flavour. The service was good. I went with a large group that was unexpected...we didn't have a reservation...and the staff stepped up and were professional to accommodate our group."}
{"text":"The wait is approximately 30 minutes. Anyway short story we didn't have our reservation cause I think the lady didn't get anything I was saying, so we ate at the bar. What made me pick this restaurant was the special 2 for 22$ that's on from like Sunday to Wednesday usually there was a choice of baby back ribs or other things. The ribs are pretty good but to make more profit I believe they mixed half the ribs with half chicken. Already the ribs were smaller than the regular full price dish. The chicken was disgusting it's a slice of chicken.. Yes a weird slice, marinated in the ribs sauce. So I will not be returning to this restaurant cause I think I can get better quality for the price and if I don't want to spend too much to go eat I'll find another restaurant."}
{"text":"Was open today, very good service and t h e food too. The price is medium high depend on what you choose. But generaly the place.is big and clean. You can eat different things and if you dont need you can go just take a drink in the bar section with the big tv scream. The parking was so free bu y normaly full."}
{"text":"Bof... J'ai commandé un steak de surlonge coupe Baseball avec cuisson style Pittsburg. Avec ça, un accompagnement de légumes grillées que notre serveuse nous avait tant vanté.   Résultat : La cuisson de ma viande était ratée et la petite serveuse punkette avec ses cheveux en l'air s'est trompé et m'a servie des légumes vapeurs à la place. Lorsque que je lui ai indiqué son erreur, elle a d'abord argumenté pour finalement se rectifier en consultant son carnet.   Quand je lui ai dit que la cuisson n'était pas à mon gout, elle m'a avoué que la cuisson Pittsburg était une méthode difficile et que \"les cuisiniers ne la maitrise pas très bien ici\" selon ses propres mots. Quoi ? Vous rigolez ? Vous auriez pu me dire ça avant, non ? Sinon quoi ? C'est un steak-house ici ou non ? Depuis quand un steak-house ne maitrise pas tous les types de cuisson de viande ?   Conclusion : très difficile de trouver un bon resto dans ce coin de la rue Sherbrooke-Est. Ce n'est pas ici que ça va changer."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to watch the hockey game and landed at Madison's. The service was fast and friendly. We ordered chicken wings and nachos and dessert. There was also plenty of parking in the area. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Thank god we made a reservation a couple hours before we showed up or we would've been waiting for a long time before getting seated.  When we did get there (a few minutes late), we waited 5 minutes and then we had our table. Service was great and the 2 for 22$ plates were more than enough for my big appetite. We were 4 so and we all took something from the choices available for this promotion. I personally took the chicken/ribs combo and it was delicious!! My girlfriend took the chicken fingers and they were good too, but she preferred my plate. To top it, the portion of fries was quite generous.  Overall, our experience was pretty good this time around although I've had worse from this place before."}
{"text":"Been a few times to this location. Never had any issues.i always order the ribs (this place is you're basics for ribs) Friendly waiter/waitress, price is reasonable for what you get. It does the trick when u wanna eat out without breaking the wallet."}
