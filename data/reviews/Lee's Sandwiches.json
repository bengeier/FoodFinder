{"text":"The best thing about being trapped working in a dark, reality-TV, control-room is that LEE's Sandwiches is ONE BLOCK AWAY! The #5 Pork Sandwich has always been a classic for me. Having been to college in the OC (CA), one of the few places that's open and crowded at 200am is LEE's! The smell of fresh Baguette's is devine."}
{"text":"Hankering for a tasty bahn mi (baguette sandwich)?

Placed in the Asian enclave at Warner & Dobson, this gem is definitely the best sandwich place in the valley.   The bakery is authentically Vietnamese and French.  Pick up tins of real French butter, crusty baguettes, small or large croissants, French horns filled with creme anglais, tasty hot puff pastries filled will pate, crunch friend shrimp and pork egg roll, Vietnamese spring rolls, or get yourself either a freshly made Vietnamese or French style baguette (or croissant) sandwich.   Don't stop there.  They have ice cream, smoothies and iced coffee (which is sadly mostly ice - the only criticism I could make about this place), muffins, cookies...

Get there early, and by that I mean when they open, and you can also get Deli Manjoo, little creme filled cakes they sell by the box-full.  They quickly run out, and like the true artists they are they only make a certain amount, and when they're gone, that's it. 

My favorite things to order here are the sardine or vegetarian banh mi's.  They both have the picked carrot and daikon you come to expect on anything Vietnamese, but also cilantro and hot peppers.  The Sardines certainly have some tomato sauce, the vegetarian have tasty strips of deep fried tofu.  Scrumptious!

Service is quick and efficient, no small talk.  Be warned, they don't take cards and the cash machine in the store charges like $2.  Don't grumble, they've passed the savings on to you.  Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"I love vietnamese coffee and the sandwiches they make there are delicious..and its soo cheap.. free internet and a place for you to lounge..and do absolutely nothing.  It almost make me feel as if I were  home."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place for sandwiches, Lee's sandwiches got amazing variety of sandwiches, snacks, baked goods and drinks (coffee, juice, tea) to chose from. They are busy but is not a long wait for your food. The only con I could think of is they only accept cash but they have a ATM by the line incase you don't have cash in hand. They're doing this so they can keep the cost low I guess.... 

Such a big fan of their sandwiches but too bad this is the only location in Arizona, mostly located in California and its such a long drive from phoenix but worth coming to check it out and its great deal. Whenever I come here I usually just order a bunch to take home.

They need to open more locations in the valley.."}
{"text":"I went in first time experiencing very rude service by one female staff.There is simply no knowledge of serving customers in her with very harsh language, arrogant attitude and improper language etc. it's better the owner train their staffs to be more friendly customer oriented."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night around 7 which wasn't packed, so glad it wasn't because it takes a pretty long time to get your order. I ordered a croissant roast beef sandwich and cantaloupe boba drink. The sandwich was not bad it was pretty good and a decent size. 

This place was nice and clean, really bright, that's because it is still new. The staff was okay, not too friendly yet not too rude. As for parking good luck because it is at Chinatown and we all know how the parking is at Chinatown. 

No credit cards taken, just like the ones in California so make sure you've got the cash if not they do have an ATM which you know cost money."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches offers good sandwiches at affordable prices. I've gotten tired of paying $8+ for a sandwich at Subway where I can get one at Lee's for half the price. The only reasons I wouldn't rate Lee's at 5/5 is because they are still CASH ONLY and the ice cream doesn't always look so fresh."}
{"text":"Just walked int lees and ordered  a ice cofee and was told there was a 10.00 minimum  to use debit not very happy"}
{"text":"I definitely got my Asian sandwich craving fix here during and after my pregnancy. As usual, I ordered the bbq pork sandwich. It was great and reminded me of home. They had a lot of stuff on the menu including European sandwiches which my husband enjoyed. From steam buns, to thai tea, boba drinks, coconut waffles, and packaged snacks, I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who wants lunch in china town. It was pretty cheap here if anyone wants a cheap lunch. You do get a lot for your money. 

Customer service was great. They were friendly, fast, and efficient. They got my order out in five minutes or less even when there was a rush. They have a lot booths and it's fairly spaced out. It's not hard to find either, considering how compact Chinatown is. 

I do see a lot of bad reviews in here, but it's definitely a place people should check out at least once. I just wish they had something like this in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Been to a few lee's sandwich in cali. Service was 10x better and faster. I waited more then 15 min for a f*** coffee. Not to mention the manager was very unprofessional.  Doest say a word or smile. Sorry for making u wait? I live in vegas now. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place for good Vietnamese sandwiches. The combination sandwich is a good one. Nice service, but not much people going there (perhaps we were there a little early, around 9ish am)"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for awhile because eating \"banh mi\" is nostalgic to my childhood.  And it's comfort food next to eating \"pho.\"  I also keeping going back because its the only place that sells it in Chandler.  BUT... I must agree with others that they are skimping on the meat more and more each day.  AND today they skimped on the cilantro and pickled carrots/daikon.  SERIOUSLY?!  Have no clue why the wait is so long since they have so many employees standing around.  The french coffee is not traditional since they don't actually use a presser on each order, but instead its pre-mixed from their corporate office and tastes a bit chemical like.  Need to open my own banh mi shop and stop complaining :)"}
{"text":"love the services, specially coffee in the morning and a vegie sandwich, i am in heaven, recommended for those who like fast and good services....definitely go back"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are A-Ok! I highly recommend upgrading to the double meat option for optimum NOM."}
{"text":"-Cash only

-With 4 people making sandwiches, service was still SLOW

-Lee's combination sandwich was mediocre. Just like a previous reviewer stated, I also found the taste to be off  and it made me feel sick after eating half

-Do not get the thai tea here, VERY sweet and has a weird after taste

I prefer Mr. Sandwich still"}
{"text":"man, the bread is hard as hell. everything else is okay. check out hue thai for some good banh"}
{"text":"How is this not 5 starry stars in your world?  It's not subway?  It's cash only?  You had to wait 68 seconds longer than you would like?  It's the cash only isn't it?  Man up ya big baby.  

Get down and dirty and get the #1 Combo or the Grilled Pork.  These are the only two you need to consider.  Set your alarm for Lee Sandwich and get one tomorrow.  

Shakes are good, try a Durian one day and feel the burn.  I got a large and could only get through about 1/3.  I'm a big bad man, this thing made me rethink life's meaning.

Take some Steamed Buns home too, the best around!  I'm not saying that to sound cute on this website.  I'm frickin serious.  The best.

Thank you Lee's, keep doing what you do.  Keep it cash, that's bad ass, period."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are pretty good but it takes forever just for them to make it and the worse part is they won't take a card unless it's over a certain minimum. It sucks that I have to go get cash just so I can get $3 sandwich. The only plus is that it's open 24 hours and great for super late night banh mi craving but be ready to wait your whole life."}
{"text":"I love there iced coffees! ive never eaten the food, but i hear the sandwiches arent bad"}
{"text":"Very good fresh french baguette combination. Iced latte  is delicious. 
Try the Green Waffle for desert."}
{"text":"Besides the smell when entering this establishment, the sandwiches are great !! So many to try from, you can not tell that you ate a vegetarian sandwich. The baguettes are baked fresh. I had a chance to try a few of them that day.I wish they had more options for the Banh Mi.
 Being from Europe, I don't recall some of these being european sandwiches. More like American. I will be back again to try some more."}
{"text":"They are so unorganized. Had to wait an hour just for 3 sandwiches. While I see people who came in after me with huge orders get their orders first. They need to get there act together."}
{"text":"I tried giving Lee's the benefit of the doubt. I did. But unless you tip big and speak the language you are bound to get ripped off. 

The first time I was here I ordered a Banh mi to go, once I got home and opened it, I felt a scavenger hunt for the meat was necessary.

The second time I went there, it was so packed they gave me the wrong order!

And now, when I went there I was short on cash so couldn't tip well...and what do I get for my insolence? An ounce of coffee with a TON of ice. 
Thanks Lee's! Good to see you're being fair to, both, your rich and poor customers!!! 

I've definitely found better Vietnamese places around the area and near where I live. So fret not lovers of Banh mi and Pho, there is still hope!
Never again..."}
{"text":"Vegetarian sandwich was disappointing. Very dry ingredients and not enough fresh vegetables. I'm not counting the pickled daikon and carrots. Besides that, only fresh ingredients were jalapenos and cilantro-of which there was not much.
3 stars for store and bread. Lots of choices and deserts, pastries and drinks.
please work on this, lee's. I will just buy bread from here and make my own until improved. Still would come here for the interesting items they stock and fresh sugar cane juice!"}
{"text":"The only thing I like about this place is there Iced coffee and the Roasted Beef sandwiches. 

Lee's Sandwiches is Over RATED!!!"}
{"text":"Bomb Dot Com. Must try the hot wings and their iced coffee is pretty strong, if you like coffee. I prefer the Thai Iced Tea. Mmm perfect! Nice clean environment, friendly staff and nice little waiting area, so you're not just standing around awkwardly."}
{"text":"I ordered the combination sandwich for lunch and it was good. I've had better but it was not bad for the price. Loved the bread though, it wasn't too hard. Parking sucks if the plaza is busy. However, the restaurant itself, I think is very cute."}
{"text":"My fav place every time I came to town! They have the best chicken wings & banh mi....would recommended for everyone who pass by Vegas !!!"}
{"text":"Sadly a costly business decision cost them another customer.  Apparently overnight they raised the minimum debit/credit to $20.00 due to increasing Costs?!?!  Sadly they lost more than that with me. Mediocre sandwiches, a perpetually dirty floor and now this....Mr. Lee when will you get it?"}
{"text":"Banh mi is super tasty.  Fresh baked bread and ingredients.  Love the coconut waffles and honeydew smoothie."}
{"text":"Lee's has been a chain I've heard about from natives of Orange County, but I had never been to a location until I went to the one in Vegas' Chinatown.

My friends got some banh mi, steamed buns, and Vietnamese coffee. I ordered the combination banh mi and my hunger was sated. Nothing stood out or was overly special about it. Their bread was on the squishy side. I heavily prefer the freshness of the ingredients and crisp bread used in the sandwiches from Dakao. The Viet coffee was pretty bold and strong, but provided the needed caffeine fix. They fill the cup completely with ice, so there's not a lot of coffee, but the stuff packs a potent punch.

At the time, we thought the food was pretty decent. That is, until a while later, they ended up feeling queasy and one friend had stomach pains. It was enough for us to throw the remnants of our food away immediately. No question.

First time at Lee's ever proved that it'll be my last for the Nevada locations."}
{"text":"If you're tired of hitting Subway for lunch day after day (and you should be), head over to Lee's in Chandler for a change of pace. The sandwiches at Lee's cost half as much, are much more flavorful and interesting than the chain sub places, AND their bread is about a billion times better. Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside, you better believe we bought an extra baguette (for $1) to take with us after we ate our sandwiches.

On my first visit, I had the grilled chicken asian sandwich, and while I wouldn't describe the meat portion as huge, the bread to condiment to meat ratio was spot on. The sandwiches come with some sort of mayo-like spread, your meat of choice, and veggies including cilantro, carrot, and raw jalapenos. I like my food on the spicy side, so I enjoyed the jalapenos, but they do add some heat to the sandwich. 

Why go for bland Subway when you can get something way more interesting and fresh for less? Give Lee's a try; your comatose tastebuds and your wallet will thank you.

Edit: Returned to Lee's last weekend and decided to be adventurous this time. I tried the combination (#11) sandwich, and after assuring the cashier that I knew what I was getting into (namely, head cheese), I thoroughly enjoyed the sandwich. The combination of headcheese and pate provided a unique texture and flavor experience that was anything but mundane (at least to a girl with no prior head cheese experience)."}
{"text":"Yummm love their sandwiches especially number 11! It's cheap And sooo good and fills u up. The sandwiches may be odd to some ppl but u have to try it! It's a burst of flavor. A con about this place is that sometimes the cashier man looks like he's annoyed or depressed. Cashiers should be positive! Or they get no tip! And it's cash only which is also a pain in the butt. It's 2011 and we all use a card nowadays doh"}
{"text":"Since Lee's Sandwiches stores start poppin up like Mc Donalds in neighborhoods. I instantly fell in love with their fresh Banh Mi n Vietnamese coffee! This store location in LV Chinatown is a great addition n the 24/7 operation hrs is super! Even the poster in front of the store indicate future first lady president Hilary Clinton gave her shield of approval. How cool is that!"}
{"text":"I had always thought this was a Chandler restaurant, not a California chain, but the instant I walked in the door and saw how institutionalized it looked, I knew it had to be a chain.  But a damn cool one at that.  

How many places have a Baguette factory pumping out fresh baguettes every 30 minutes?  Yeah, they aren't MJ Bread quality, but hoo ya momma, they are crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside and yum good!

I ordered a lemondade (hand made, caused a delay, three orders behind me got their sammiches first), but it was fresh and tasty, though smallish (12oz with ice?).

And the funny part was the only Vietnamese in the place (18-19 year old girl) running the cash register warned me that my shredded pork (#8) had fish sauce on it and it was 'an acquired taste!'  I loved it.  The first time I had fish sauce I was in love.  

The only other sandwich shop that hit me in the yummer like this one was Birley's on Market Street in SFO.  

I wish it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"I think this is a good example of \"A-OK\" for me. I found nothing really wrong with this Lee's, I've just had a better experience at another branch next to a university.

I got a Lee's combo sandwich and a Lee's iced coffee. Sandwich was good, fresh baked bread with the unique flavors of peppered meat and pickled veggies. Coffee was sweet and so strong I'm still feeling the buzz. Food was everything I'd come to expect, except it was slightly pricier than the other branch I'd been to (I think, its been awhile). Also this place seemed less alive and not as friendly (I might chalk that up to all the college students though). So I'll still be going to Lee's if I want a different kind of sandwich or a coffee to pwn my face, just maybe not this branch."}
{"text":"I was a little scared to try this place after seeing all of the bad reviews.  I came in with realistic expectations knowing it wouldnt be as good as the bahn mi's I'd had in Socal, but was pleasantly surprised.  I'd say their sandwiches are a 3.5, but I rounded up to 4 since we dont have many options in Vegas.  

First the bread was very fresh and had a nice crunch to it.  The vegetables inside were also had a nice crunch and paired nicely with their bbq pork.  The restaurant is nice and clean and at under $4 a sandwich the value is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I like the seating area, but the food....... nah, don't really interest me at all. I wouldn't mind to go have a drink there and hang out late at night."}
{"text":"I always make it a point to visit Lee's Sandwiches everytime I'm in AZ.  Luckily my family lives in Chandler and just a few blocks from Lee's.  

Sandwiches always taste fresh here.  I normally order a few sandwiches for me and the family.  My favorite is the special combo #11.  Others we've tried are the regular Lee's combo #1, grilled pork #5, BBQ pork #6, and their ham & cheese croissant.  You can opt to have the veggies on the side.  

They bake their bread onsite, so it always tastes fresh.  The last time I visited AZ, the #11 sandwich was $2+ each, but when I went by today, it was up to $3.05.  Still, that's cheap for a filling sandwich.  The #5 and #6 are $2.85 each.  They have hot food items for sale off to the right of the registers, such as steamed pork buns, which are $1.75 each.  Thai iced teas (no boba) are $2.55 each. 

The place is clean and their employees serve you with a smile.  

Luckily, there are no Lee's Sandwiches near my house in L.A.; the closest one is about 30 miles.  Otherwise, I would be eating one everyday!  

Parking can be hard to find during busy hours, but you can always park at the Walgreens lot next door."}
{"text":"Don't put out coupons if you don't want to honor them...that's what I call BAIT & SWITCH. The picture below shows a perfectly valid coupon from Valpak. The first time I tried to use this BOGO, I tried showing it on my mobile device, but Lupe (the cashier/night-time supervisor) said it must be printed out. Fine, but the coupon could be more clear and say \"must be printed\". I returned a few nights later with a \"printed\" coupon and got another cashier to accept it. I also got a digital punch for their Epoxy Loyal Program. Lupe witnessed this and then scolded her cashier to not allow for punches to be given when a BOGO is used. I returned a third time last night. Lupe was the cashier, and once again, she refused a perfectly valid coupon. She said she was just following the rules and that I can contact her manager Benito. When I finally spoke to him today, he told me that I was abusing the system 
by trying to use the Valpak coupon in combination with their Epoxy stamp (Customer Loyalty Program), and that he had me on video. So now I am the sandwich criminal! Their customer service is a joke...instead of just giving me a lousy $4.00 sandwich, they are just jerks about it. I understand that some coupons say \"Not to be combined with any other offer.\" I don't think asking for 1 Epoxy stamp was unreasonable since I was still technically paying for 1 of the 2 sandwiches that I would be getting with the coupon, but if that's against their policy, I can totally understand. But, that isn't reason to just ban me from using the Valpak BOGO coupon. They just have to politely say that I can either use one promotion or the other. FYI, there are many other restaurants that will allow me to use a coupon and a loyal stamp/punch card. It's not a big deal."}
{"text":"My husband was so excited when Lee's opened in Henderson since Chinatown is quite a trek for us.  He loves the sandwiches.  I am more interested in the iced coffee and boba smoothies.  We noticed that they are usually understaffed and it takes a while to get your order.  The other downfall is the smell.  They have poor ventilation and the smell stays with you after you leave.  However, this does not stop us from going there.  The lychee smoothie is so refreshing and delicious!  Glad to have the option nearby."}
{"text":"this place is terrible . I bought a sweet Vietnamese cake with green bean dessert that tasted like a rock . their baguette is so tough . Go to Mr Sandwich"}
{"text":"I stopped by late one evening just to satisfy my craving for some Banh Mi. I had a combination Banh Mi and it was pretty good. The bread isn't the French baguette I am familiar with since I was a child and what mom and pop Vietnamese sandwich shops offer but it was descent.The Banh Bao is pretty good, I am glad the were putting out a fresh batch so I figured it was a top seller. Overall, it's a very convenient stop for anyone that is craving some Banh Mi and not a typical sub sandwich!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having a Lee's sandwiches nearby, but I'll make the trip to the Chandler location instead. Never had a problem with this chain until I visited today and ordered the grilled chicken. I was disappointed to find that I only had five pieces of chicken in my sandwich! The wait was long but that's understandable since I did come during a rush hour. Be warned, not every location has the same quality or in this case quantity."}
{"text":"New place !! Very unorganized!! We ordered 1 sandwiches and 1 boba drink, our sandwiches came in a timely manner, but the drink took 20min. Once we received our drink, the cup was not full.  Once I complain the staff offer to make me another drink. I have to return back to work and could not wait another 20 minutes for another drink ,so I asked for my money back.  The stuff was nice enough to refund me and gave me the drink for free.  Not a good first impression."}
{"text":"Bring cash and then get ready to eat amazing sandwiches! My husband and I come here roughly once a week for lunch. Everything I've eaten here has been delicious, I usually get the bbq pork Bahn Mi and an iced coffee or Thai iced tea (the drinks are amazing there too). The restaurant has amble seating and is bright and very clean.  One of my favorite local haunts :)"}
{"text":"Has only been open for 2 days. Figured I would try them out. 2 stars because they offered free coffee with purchase of a sandwich for the first 2 days of being open. The time in line to the time I received my order was about 35 minutes. The sandwich bread was burnt which made texture of the bread hard on the roof of my mouth. If you have ever had one of these sandwiches when the bread is hard, you will know the top of your mouth gets tore up. There is little seating when the place is busy. We were there at 2:00 pm but seem to clear up a little by the time we ate and left. Hopefully they improve there speed and not serve burnt bread in the future."}
{"text":"I would have given lee's sandwich 1 stars a few months back but after the recommendation of my friend, I tried their pork sandwich and I must say, I've been back a few time in just the last few weeks. I'm not too crazy about the other items on their menu but that sandwich alone is worth going back for. Their open late also so convenient."}
{"text":"Great baguettes that you can also take home and I really enjoy the vegan/vegetarian sandwich  option here. Very tasty for a $3.00 sandwich! I also get an iced Vietnamese plain coffee here and those bad boy keeps me up all night long....its so strong...I kid you not, had the coffee had 3:30 in the aftetnoon and I actually went to bed @7:30 am the next day......couldn't fall asleep....perfect road trip companion. Those coffees do it to me every time ! Anyways bring cash or they have an ATM inside !"}
{"text":"Been here twice already and it needs work! I asked the cashier for a large Soy Bean milk and he made us buy the bottle when they actually do sell a large Soy Bean Milk. I had the Grilled Pork and the Special Combo Banh Mi. The Grilled Pork was skinny I would recommend the combo any day. If you decide to order any type of iced drinks be prepared to drink mostly ice. The coconut waffles are good, I would recommend to get them fresh otherwise they're left out and soggy. They are 24 hours which is good. They also have breakfast sandwiches but they are only served until 1100. The prices are decent. I've seen other places where the bahn mi are priced around 5 bucks. Also, this place is currently cash only."}
{"text":"I like how open and clean the store is.

Though I am sad they took my favorite sandwich off the menu (#13) years ago, but am still down for getting a sandwich there when I am around the area. 

My friends seem to like viet coffee very much as well. 

Too bad they are not doing the little cake any more and the place (at this location) seem to be dying down compare to when they first open. 

Don't like the new close earlier hours either. Wish they would open way after 8. When they used to close at 9, I thought they were closing too early already. 

Hope they do something different about the store and boost the business again, don't want to see it disappear from AZ."}
{"text":"They have the worst customer service!!! Don't recommend it at all . There sandwiches ain't as good as PHO90!"}
{"text":"The best sandwiches and shakes in town!"}
{"text":"The iced coffee is the best!!! The bread for sandwhiches is tastey, but a little hard to eat. The fresh veges on the sandwhiches are really good, before if you don't like jalepe jalapeños, they put fresh ones on there as well."}
{"text":"Some people don't know what Pate is so let me explain:  Pate comes from France, it's a kind of spread that French families eat everyday (like American has Mayonnaise or Peanut Butter), it's in their sandwiches, it's in restaurants, it's in every corner of the streets. It also comes in many different kinds, can be expensive, kind of \"high class\" appetizer food.  Vietnam was French colony so that's why we know Pate and like it, too.
For Smoothies I recommend Jack Fruit, Strawberries, Mangoes.
French way we usually have hot coffee and croissant for breakfast or in the afternoon, the best croissant to go with your coffee is Almont Croissant or Raisin Croissant.
Please try next time when you stop by."}
{"text":"I ordered today a sandwich number 34 (Pork Roll & Pate), the bread was so good just came out from the oven fresh and soft enough (sometime when it's more crunchy it must be because it was in the oven a little bit too long), the filling of Pork Roll & Pate & Mayonnaise & Veggies were really good, along with a good strong unbeatable iced coffee ! I recommend Lees if you want a good casual meal without hurting your pocket.  They are opening another location on Eastern by Serene / Richmar, a busy shopping area in Henderson by the airport, I will go there for sure.  Thanks to Lees for expanding their business to Las Vegas, before I could have their goodies only in California.  I give 5 stars for keeping the place nice and clean, besides good food."}
{"text":"Try the Asian sandwich, avocado smoothie, and don't forget the macaroons. Cannot eat LEE'S every night, but it is an above average sandwich. 

Most people do not have the guts to try the avocado smoothie, but it is delicious.

The macaroons are a nice finish also.

If you're looking for a sandwich place and want something way better than subway- this is your place!"}
{"text":"Omg they are so good!! Bahn mi is amazing!!! I love sandwich shops and this one is very good in my opinion.  Esp in the chandler area! Great prices too."}
{"text":"This review is based on a grilled pork sandwich. I have to say their sandwiches are cheap, but you get what you paid for. First of all, it took about 15 mins for them to complete my one sandwich order. Let me put this into perspective: there were 10 workers in the back making sandwiches, and it took them that long. Sure, I came into an already existing long wait as there were people ahead who've already waited longer than I have. But still, the long waits are unacceptable. 

The food: one word, tasteless. The carrot and turnip had no flavor. Its like they forgot to put sugar and vinegar when they soaked it. The meat was not too bad, it was one of the best parts of the sandwich. The bread was ofcourse, indeed one of the highlights of the experience. It was definitely fluffy since it was baked fresh.

Last of all, they have a wifi access point, but I don't think they advertised it for public use. If you have T-Mobile, there is no 3g while you are inside.

Conclusion: I would rather go to Mr. Sandwiches instead and pay just a bit more for better quality and taste, and to save myself 15 mins of my life."}
{"text":"Among the best sandwich place ever ... 
The french bread they made is amazing ... crispy outside, soft inside .... with the perfect aroma .... and the BBQ inside just make a perfect compliment to the amazing bread .... 

And did I mention, it is darn cheap too .... I am willing to pay 3 times what they are charing for the same sandwich .... and honestly, even if you pay 3x as much else where, the sandwich you get most likely won't be half as good

worth trying, don't be intimidated by Asian sandwich place ... you will find plenty of great surprise"}
{"text":"The #17 banh mi and pork and egg banh baos really hit the spot. I came here only to grab some buns at first, but the smell of the baguettes in the air made me order a sandwich as well. It was well worth buying it, the prices are pretty inexpensive too! Service was friendly and my food came out really quick. I will be making more trips back here in the future."}
{"text":"Love this place. Stopped by this place for the first time and I was not disappointed. Even my children loved their sandwiches, and they're picky eaters to say the least! I really LOVED their Vietnamese sandwich. I was so impressed with their sandwich that my husband was willing to drive out to buy me some late at night. Unfortunately, we live 30 miles away and decided to go against it."}
{"text":"Was working right in front of this sandwich place and I thought if give it a try.

Always loved the Vietnamese sandwiches!
Finally a place where you know they make it!
I'm not really fond of egg rolls, but I must say that the rolls here are quite decent.
Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"So this is usually where everyone ends up if we can't pick exactly what we want.  The fact that it's open 24/7 is very helpful.  The fact that the food is only OK is why it can only get a solid 3 star rating from me.  Nothing is quite memorable.  When you leave you're OK but most of the time Im thinking \"if we would have left earlier or made the decision faster we could have been somewhere REALLY good\".  I hate to down the place because I know I will go back again and again, and not complain but maybe I should, haha....  Another thing is why does it have to be cash only?  REALLY?!?!  You're open 24 hours, you have so many things to offer and you CAN'T take a CREDIT CARD!!!!!!!!  Get it together people, I am almost about to take a star off for that, haha....."}
{"text":"4-stars for value.  Great place to fill up on cheap, tasty sandwiches before or after shopping at Lee Lee Oriental Supermarket.

Menu offers:
- European sandwiches
- Asian sandwiches
- Gourmet coffee
- Smoothies, Asian iced drinks and Italian sodas
- Housemade ice cream

We've never had the urge to order the European sandwich.  The Asian one's all come with pickled shredded daikon and carrots, sliced onions, jalapeno, cilantro, mayo mixed with soy sauce on a crusty house-baked 10inch baguette.  

Tip: If you're not eating it right away, ask for veggies on the side - otherwise the whole thing gets soggy.  This way it still tastes good the next day after toasting.  Plus they always give you more this way.

Our standard picks are:

#1. Lee's Combination Sandwich $2.20
- ham, headcheese (offcuts from the head of a pig/calf rolled in gelatin) and pate
- great contrast of textures and flavors between the 3 kinds of meat: crunchy headcheese vs soft pate (I can just picture some of you wincing.)

# 5. Grilled Pork Sandwich $2.20
- Grilled Vietnamese-style vs Chinese BBQ (#6), which we don't like as much because it's too sweet - we prefer savory with just a hint of sweetness and the charred smokiness from the grill

Cafe Sua Da $2.20 
- Vietnamese drip coffee with crushed ice
- Lee's signature drink which they also make into ice cream
- As much caffeine as a quadruple shot

Too bad this is the only one in Arizona.  There are almost 30 in California.  Props to the owners - this is the most well-run Asian fastfood chain on the West Coast or maybe the US.  Evidence of their success is in the ridiculously large shiny space, huge baguette machine and expensive bathroom fixtures.  Fastfood never looked this good.

Remember cash only."}
{"text":"I love this place! One of my fave sandwich places! They bake their own bread and the sandwiches are fantastic! The prices are awesome but beware it's because they are CASH ONLY so make sure you bring some skrilla with you and no plastic! The place is big plenty of seating in and out. They also have ice cream, shakes, and morning baked yummy goods! Mmmm"}
{"text":"Cheap food, hip atmosphere, but the sandwich's are just so-so.  The head-cheese they include on some of the sandwiches kind of turns me off."}
{"text":"Ya this place was cheap but it didn't knock my socks off.  I tried the #56 like recommended on here.  The wife had the BBQ chicken sandwich.  The boba mango smoothie was pretty decent.  But the meal wasn't worth writing home about. I'd recommend it only if you must try every new place in the valley. If not, stick to Subway."}
{"text":"This place does not accept debit cards?? They have to catch up with the times, this is Not such chinese village in china, they are 100 years back in time, wont come here again!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to update my review and say that the banh mi here are pretty good when you eat them the day made and not hoard them for later on in the week. It goes without saying, I suppose, but the bread does get very dry over a few days. Sandwiches best eaten immediately after. And I really liked the #78, a fried pork roll banh mi."}
{"text":"Finally! A place that has good quality Banh Mi without smelling like dead fish or having rotting walls/floors. Super clean location! Nice staff. Sometimes fresh deserts in the cooler. I will be back. Most likely to buy a few at a time. The perfect re-heatable lunch, if you just pop it in the toaster oven it is warm and crispy again in minutes! Only qualm is I wish they would be a bit more generous with the pickled carrot & radish when I ask for extra."}
{"text":"We probably go there 2-3 times per month. Sandwiches are good size--enough for my husband for lunch, and I often get full before finishing the last bite or two. Our favorite is Grilled Pork sandwich.

Baguettes are tasty and cheap -- you can make your own sandwich with it, of course, but we usually just dip it in olive oil or spread some cheese on it and eat it. Their meat pie is also delicious.

I love that they have free Wi-Fi! That they only take cash is sometimes inconvenient but I do appreciate that thins are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Their #5 grilled pork is my standby. Everything is on-point, though nothing stands out as exceptional. But it's a bahn mi chain, and that in itself is pretty damn awesome."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are alright, but every time i get a sandwich from here they barely put any meat on it. It can be ridiculously expensive too for such poor quality food. Its not the best, but maybe it is just the location here in las vegas. Me and my friends also miss that one girl who was cashier. I havent seen her all week, so im assuming she is gone because i used to see her all the time here. She was cute and had a great personality. I wish a lot of the cashiers there were like that. The music they play is repetitive and loud. It makes it difficult to tell them what i want to order. I noticed they have been putting on different tv shows on their tvs lately too. The only downfall about this place is that me and my friends found hair in our food and one of our friends got food poisoning. Talk about health concerns. Its an alright place, my favorite thing there is their pate chauds, coconut waffles, and their passion fruit juice."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hate for Lee's here... You're in Vegas. Lee's is a convenient 5 minute drive from the strip. It's open 24 hours. The food is CHEAP. Vietnamese coffee. Fresh baguettes. And daily food/drink specials to encourage even more gluttonous behavior (as if you needed more incentives anyways). Whenever I've come, the service is always friendly, I never wait too long for my food, and I leave happy and full for the drive back home. Perhaps I simply leave my \"diva\" back in LA because I have no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Prices are good and moderate and that Sugar Cane Drink is So Goood.."}
{"text":"I LOVE Lee's !! The prices are ridiculously low, the food is fresh and tastes great.  I love the #11- 2 different kinds of ham on the baguette.  And the bacon, egg, and cheese on the baguette with a coffee for breakfast .  The staff is always very friendly.  I try to pick up lunch for my office staff ( 4 of us ) about every other week and for just a few dollars, I'm a Rock Star to them!!  Deal with the parking that is always horrible in Chinatown, and get to Lee's!!  OH!! they will take credit or debit cards if you spend a minimum, but they prefer cash.."}
{"text":"This are not gourmet sandwiches but it doesn't matter because they are so delicious!! It's definitely the bread because I get the veggie sandwich with avocado and none of the toppings are \"awesome\" - although they do give you a lot of yummy avocado! Whether you get the croissant or the baguette you'll be happy. However, I didn't like the Asian Vegetarian sandwich at all so I wouldn't recommend you get that one! My husband LOVES their shrimp spring rolls too!! They have awesome prices but the catch is that they only take cash - although they do have an ATM if you forget. I should also mention that you can get the best baguette ever for a little over a dollar. I don't buy baguettes from anywhere else! If they're fresh out of the oven and warm you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"The Banh Mi was solid. Fulfilled the craving I was having, but I'm still in search of something to equal that of Don cafe in houston TX."}
{"text":"I come from  LA first time sandwhich is okay but I prefer hot BUT pastries are Delicious also its 24hr so you  can't  beat that  over all good  experience"}
{"text":"Since not eating any meat for a month now and I went in to try their veggie sandwich. It was ok I guess but the best place to get green waffles though.."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese sandwich and Lee's makes it really good and tasty, BUT my family and friends got turned off by the service when we went there a couple of weeks ago. We ordered 10 special sandwiches, which cost about two quarters more than the regular sandwich. When we got the food, they weren't the specials we ordered, just the regular kind. Unfortunately, some of us had already taken a bite on the subs and thought that maybe we should just ignore the mistake and make the most out of what we have. However, my uncle insisted on exchanging them with the right ones because the difference in amount, when added together, is still a good sum of change (He paid and as a person, he's the type who holds on to every penny he can cz of the recession). Anyway, we had them exchanged but management just dumped the missing meats in the original subs we got (the wrong ones), re-wrapped them,  and gave them back to us without us knowing which belongs to whom. It was just disgusting and disappointing! I think they should have given us brand new sandwiches because it was their mistake for giving us the wrong order in the first place, and that is how good customer service should be. Obviously, my uncle did not let that slip and insisted that we got brand new sandwiches. It was one bad experience that destroyed the company's reputation altogether, and since then, we just never came back, especially my uncle who made sure that everyone, friends, families, and strangers, hear about that horrible incident."}
{"text":"Turkey and roast beef on a freshly baked croissant.. possibly the best sandwich I've ever eaten.. I wish I had more hands, so I could give this sammich 4 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Bahn mi inferior to Mr Sandwich in the next strip mall in basically every way, plus the place feels like a McDonald's inside."}
{"text":"just recently realized that this old San Jose fave is here in my own backyard. While I don't eat pigs, and pork is a mainstay in their menu, these guys make great chicken & veg sammiches. soon to be a regular!"}
{"text":"Banh mi or Vietnamese sandwiches bespoke of the French colonial occupation of Vietnam and their influence on Vietnamese cuisine.  The many, many varieties available at Lee's showcase this.  The baguettes are done reasonably well though its mainly a matter of preference ( I've had friends say that they are too hard and others say that they are too small or skinny), I find them quite acceptable.  The favorites and ones usually most ordered by the Asian customers tend to be the Banh mi's.  There are western styles based on croissant as well as baguettes.  The croissant texture is good and the taste buttery.  Though again complaint range from not being enough \"fluffy\" to \"too buttery\".  
The drinks are vietnamese style iced and fruit drinks ranging from durian, mango, etc. to penny wort.  Iced coffee is fantastic though it may seem very small but the caffeine kick definitely lets you know its European origins.  
Gelato is present and its a shame more people don't get it because its well made and quite a bargain.  
Spring rolls are great and really addictive.  Pork buns are ok.  The pate pastries are great as well as the other sweet rolls and muffins.
I've not had any of the other things like the imported butter so I leave that to any of you to comment.
I've had many banh mi's in Garden Grove (Little Saigon) and in Los Angeles as well as in San Diego.  As my Vietnamese friends tell me, Lee's are OK.  There are definitley better ones but I give them 4 stars for coming out to Arizona and setting up a well run sandwich shop and giving fairly affordable and tasty food."}
{"text":"I love Lee's sandwhich in general and this place is no exception.  I'm starting to feel like it's the Asian MCD since the look and feel and menu of all of them are exactly the same so I always know what to expect.  Everytime I come to this one though, there is always a looooong line.  Then when I finally order, it is still a bit of wait to get my food.  However, still worth it to me.  What do I get? My go to is always pate cha sandwhich and a durian smoothie- love love."}
{"text":"I'm only going here for Vietnamese coffee period! My husband mentioned that they sell macarons and it's only $1.25! Good price! Unlike Liberty Market charges $3.50. My husband bought lemon and raspberry macarons because that's all the flavors they have. It came in a nice packaging and the macarons looked really good. I wanted to taste the raspberry macaron first so I took a bite and long and behold the inside was raw! It was mushy and disgusting. I told my husband to get a refund. He went back to get a refund and they asked what was the problem with the macaron and he told the person at the counter that it's raw. The baker explained it to my husband that it's suppose to be like that. Like what? Raw? I make macarons myself and my macarons are not mushy. Anyways, they were nice enough to give my husband a refund. From here on out, I will only buy Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Love the sandwich here. BBQ pork so good. I can eat here everyday in the morning to start my day at work. The lines are a little long but meaning they have have good sandwich here. Better than Ba Le and good for lunch too when I don't have time to sit there and enjoy my sandwich."}
{"text":"This Lees is located in Chinatown district and is what is to be expected of the Lees establishment. It is an open atmosphere with an almost grocery like feel to it considering all the items that are posted up off to the side. The cashier is located further inside and they have tablets set up to take your order. I ended up ordering two iced coffees since that is what Lees is mostly known for. The coffee is strong and was definitely what was needed for a long trek home from Nevada to Utah. If you are in the area and want some strong Vietnamese coffee definitely give Lees a try."}
{"text":"Love the food here, especially the BBQ pork sammich, bread is great!!! I would also like to say the management goes above and beyond to make the customer happy, great staff there always, deffinately check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is the worst lees ever!
Sugar cane juice was old!
They didn't give us a sandwich we ordered but we didn't fun out till later! Cash only just bad!"}
{"text":"I preface my review with stating I am generally not a sandwich fan of any sort, so to give a sandwich place a 3 star is pretty good for me.  The husband and I got the BBQ pork and the shredded pork sandwiches.  The shredded pork was great and came with fish sauce on it (yum) and the girl at the counter had the presence of mind to warn us about the fish sauce - that it's an \"acquired taste\".  Well, luckily we both love fish sauce so this was a hit.  The BBQ pork wasn't so great - lots of chewy fat which is OK on hot meat but I have a hard time with when it's cold.  The fresh pressed lemonade was indeed fresh pressed, and lightly, perfectly sweetened.   The bread is tear-your-mouth-up crunchy, which I like - but if you're not a crunchy crust kinda person, beware."}
{"text":"It was an amazing sandwich. The bread was awesome on the #5 and yes it's a pain they only except cash only but I am down for the low prices."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my meetup group.  On my first visit, i tried the Jambon and Pate sandwich (which was way outside of my comfort zone) and the chrysanthemum tea.  At least, I was brave enough to try something so different but did not really enjoy it.  On my subsequent visit, I figured I would try something a little more mainstream so it was the Turkey Club with bacon on a baguette, which was just okay with the sugar cane juice.  Word of advice, if you decide to order the sugar cane juice also get a half cup of water so you can dilute it a bit.  Of course, I always enjoy their ice cream.  Also, keep in mind that they only take cash so be prepared."}
{"text":"This part of town has so much to chose from, but don't drive past this little place without giving it a try. When I used to live in San Diego, there were several Vietnamese restaurants and sandwich shops.  It is refreshing to find this spot because it feels like home.  The place is trendy, clean and perfect for studying.  No need to buy an overpriced Latte just to use wifi and study and other places.  The food is reasonably priced and the place is clean.  Perfect snack if you are on a budget.  If you need to study or just relax, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"The prices just went up and at first I was like ugh....  Then I realized the prices for what you get is still an excellent deal.  Bahn Mi sandwiches are awesome and in MHO, Special combo 11 is the way to go.  Baguette bread is cooked fresh on site daily, the vegetables are crisp, fresh and delicious and the smoothies are very good, if a little on the sweet side.  Throw some Boba in the smoothies, makes it complete.  Just try not to choke on one of those bad boys...  Even their wings are surprisingly very good.  Hot, a little spicy, juicy, full of flavor and $cheap$   All around excellent food and fantastic value.  CASH only."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite place to get boba drinks and deli sandwiches. Great prices. Great food. Great desserts and snacks. Friendly staff. Clean shop. They just only take cash. I have noticed over the past 10 years that more and more people are eating here (could be the out of staters moving in). Can't go wrong with Lee's."}
{"text":"My friend and I read a review of Lee's when it first opened and we went rushing in to try a bbq sandwich.  We both got the #6 bbq sandwich with extra meat.  I'm not exactly sure of the sandwich's price....but it is under $3.  The extra meat is about 75 cents more.  You can't beat the price.  The baguette is chewy, the veggies are great, be careful of the jalepenos if you don't like spice but you can ask for none if you prefer.  If you are really going for some meat, don't be afraid to order triple meat since the double portion isn't exactly overlowing.  I always just drink water here but our first time in we also order the Thai iced tea.  My friend did not like it at all and brought his tea right back up to the counter.  The person in charge was very irritated because my friend brought this drink back but he eventually gave us the money back.  I just drank mine, a milky/creamy concoction that was exotice and not-too-bad.  

Oh!  You must get a cream horn for dessert!  I think it is about a dollar and worth every cent of that dollar.  Mmmm, we love them!

All in all, not to many weeks goes by before one of us suggests going into Lee's for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"This place fkn sucks.  Dont ever go here.  Waited for 1:15 mins for my 3 sandwiches.  Hope this place fails and owner go out of business.  Fk u for being cheap amd not hiring more worker.  Waste my time and money.  Fk lee sandwich."}
{"text":"Called and ordered some sandwiches here because of a recommendation from a friend and they weren't bad. They have a lot of selections but went with the usual special combo and grilled pork."}
{"text":"This place is filthy. I don't understand how they can stay in business. Disgusting...
Never again"}
{"text":"Best sandwhich shop around.  Ingredients, beverage selection, sitting area."}
{"text":"They can put boba in your tea, iced coffee, smoothies (1st for me) & Italian soda. They make their own bread on site, which just makes their sandwiches that much more epic. I love their food. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait to get your order because it's all made fresh (unlike typical fast food joints). If you keep weird hours, this place is perfect for you because they are 24-7. Yum :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Bobas! Plus amazing customer service. My daughter lost her wallet (she didn't know she left it at Lee's) when we came back, they recognized her and gave it back, money and all!"}
{"text":"horrible service.  the place isn't even ready for a soft opening.  the employees have no idea what they're doing.  and there's this mean manager lady that's bossing everyone around; training the employees on the job, in front of the customers.  you know, i was all hyped thinking this would be something similar to the lee's sandwiches in the bay area; not even close.  2 stars cuz i like bahn-mi.  i'm gonna look elsewhere for them."}
{"text":"This particular Lee-s Sandwiches is not that good, particularly the sandwiches. This is bad because this is supposed to be their specialty.  This was what made them famous. The bread is tougher to chew on.  I have been here several times and it has been the same.  The coffee is the same as others in the chain.  The other bakery things are about the same, especially the cream filled mini cake my kids love."}
{"text":"Sandwiches on fresh made croissants and sub rolls, and some with unique toppings.  You cannot go wrong.   The ingredients were fresh and tasty, the sandwiches very large for little cost."}
{"text":"This is to the tall Asian Mixed Guy who was taking order today. Please leave your depression life at home and bring a good attitude to work. Just because your life is sad and cannot B**** at anyone other than your customers, that is just really damn sad! Don't tell me to tell you ahead to cut my sandwiches. How about save that 10 seconds of attitude and go cut the sandwich and maybe the line will move faster? Yeah? Bye Felicia!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holly Freaking Cheap Goodness... Who knew that was possible before walking in to Lee's? 

If your looking for Cheap Goodness come here for a Sandwich & a Boba Smoothie! It will fill you up for most of the day for well under $20! 

When walking in you might... scratch that... you WILL feel out of place right away. A Vietnamese Sandwich Shop that serves French Baguettes... Crazy Cool Fusion is the thing these days right! Don't be scared, pull out your Cash (ONLY CASH!), choose your Sandwich (Personal Fav is #56 w/ Extra Meat), Pick your Smoothie (Personal Fav is Honeydew w/ Boba), Drool at the other goodies & Pay. Wait for your number to be called and get ready for the Freaking Cheap Goodness! 

This is not a 5 Star Sandwich Shop... So don't expect it. Expect simple, made at home sandwiches with very limited stuff in fridge! #56 comes with a Pickle, a few slices of Onion, a package of mustard, a pepper & the Sandwich.... Simple. 

Its Fast, Its Clean, Its Food... They do a great job at it. Give them a try... and you will either Love it or Hate it... Pretty sure you will Love it."}
{"text":"The food here is legit guys and yes, I am an Asian who knows her Viet food, have ate banh mi my whole life, etc. I've had various sandwiches, eggrolls, and steam buns here and they are all pretty good. Of course they do not taste super fresh but what are you expecting? If you want fresh Viet food, go to a real Viet restaurant, not a semi \"fast food\" joint. The store is always clean and well lit. The customer service is not that bad for Vegas off of the strip. There are usually only a few customers when I'm there so the wait is never long. The prices are pretty darn cheap so that's also a huge plus.  

The only reason why I gave this place 3 stars instead of 4 is that you can not use your debit or credit card here unless you spend at least $10. There is a big sign posted right by the register. I am generally not a cash carrier and I never spend more than $10 here per visit so that poses a problem for me!  

Tip: You can ask for fish sauce if you need it. They will give it to you on the side in a plastic container."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that if it weren't for yelp, I probably never would have come here. I live literally right down the street from this place, and have driven by it about 30 times over the last two years. It always looks busy but I never had any desire to try this place. You see, I am a creature of habit. I will eat at the same five restaurants for months because I know there is something on the menu I can eat, and like. I am always hesitant to try new places or to just stop in somewhere new without knowing what I am walking into first. Thanks to yelp, and reading reviews, I realized this was a place I actually wanted to go. 

I went for lunch today with my dad. I ordered the #12 vegetarian and my dad ordered the #38 club. He also ordered some random pork and shrimp dumplings that the guy at the counter handed to us cold and wrapped like it was bought at a gas station. He expected them to be hot and was a little put off by them. My dad would later call these \"icky.\" So those are probably something we will steer clear of in the future.

The sandwiches came out super fast. I don't know what I was expecting because when it was sort of cold I seemed surprised. When I read about this sandwich on-line it said it had crispy tofu strips, so I guess I just assumed it would be hot. It was a fresh baguette with tofu, pickled carrot and daikon, jalapeno, and cilantro. I loved it! It could have used about double the amount of tofu but it had good flavors. It was just the right size for me. Not to big, not to small. I enjoyed my sandwich very much. My dad's club sandwich was huge. I had debated on ordering the avocado sandwich but was glad I didn't because his sandwich was gigantic. He liked his choice as well. The value for the food at this place is also great. We ordered two sandwiches, two drinks, and the two spring rolls, and it was less than fifteen bucks. That's awesome!

I will definitely be back here, probably quite often seeing as how its just a quick bike ride from my house. And even though they only take cash, that doesn't bother me one bit seeing as how they manage to keep their prices really low. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I've had Lees Sandwich before but in California. As much as I love sandwiches I hate to have to write bad reviews of this store.  I ordered number 1 (banh mi thit nguoi). Food-wise, everything  was wrong here. First, the bread was not crunchy and not fresh.  Second, the meat portion was little and bland.  
On the bright side, the place was clean and well organized."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for the first time and the sandwiches live up to the hype. Had a #11 and #18. Both were Delicious !!!!"}
{"text":"I have an electrical job in Chandler today and I was looking for a place to eat before I started. I stumbled upon a hidden gem! Walked up to the counter and told Andrew ( very well spoken young man) I had never been here and what did he recommend. To my surprise, he was excited to explain the menu, all the different foods they had, the smoothies ('with actual real fruit', he exclaimed lol), and that there will be one coming to Phoenix soon. Food was as good as the service and the mango & papaya smoothie.....fa-getaboutit....."}
{"text":"24 hr sandwich shop in Chinatown with cheap eats.  Bread on the sandwich was probably the best part of it."}
{"text":"I saw the \"hot bagette now\" sign flashing and assummed early in the am, this would be correct.  As my first time, I wasnt sure how to order but thought it would be a great sandwich based on the pictures. It was ok...baguette was fresh but not hot,  or warm. It was bland for a grilled pork sandwich.  The pork was not hot or warm. There was little sauce,  little veggies,  meat....lets say it was skinny. Anyway,  I'm sure I won't be back unless I want a skinny,  dry, grilled pork sandwich on a not so hot baguette.  Still, I ate it, so it gets 2 staaaas..."}
{"text":"Wow, They're finally open!

I been driving by this location for months, but they were always under construction. This has to be the nicest and biggest sandwich shop in the world, it's so huge! I was there over the weekend, and the crowd was huge. I think I waited nearly half an hour in line. As always, their sandwiches are typical Lee's sandwiches that you find at their other locations. I won't say their sandwiches are the best in the world, you either love their sandwiches or you don't. They are a franchise and they use the same ingredients, so it does matter which location you go to, their sandwiches will be the same, (think McDonld). What sets this location apart from the others is the atmospere. This is the only Lee's location that has self serve frozen yogurt, a first for Lee's! The place is very bright and very clean(after all it's new). It is very conveniently layed out. It is also a nice place hangout with your friends. I don't know when was the last time I would hang out at a sandwich shop, but you can certainly do it here. I didn't get the chance to see the whole place because it was just so huge. 

I was reading some of the other comments and it's like a broken record. I know, I know...your mom and pop sandwich shop down the street has better sandwiches. Like comparing McDonalds to a corner diner, sure the diner has better hamburger, but why do people keep going to McDonalds? You want better coffee?  then go to a coffee shop! You want better eggrolls and spring rolls, then go to a restaurant! If you want a place that you know will always be there, open and close at the right time, serve consistence quality food, and won't ask you to leave because you hang around too long, then come to Lee's !"}
{"text":"Always consistently good quality Bhan Mi that you can count on from Lee's."}
{"text":"Mediocre - neither here nor there.  

A Vietnamese grilled chicken sandwich and a European roast beef (both on baguette).  May give this place another try if I am bored with just about every type of sandwich shop in town, but otherwise, I doubt I'd re-visit.  The grilled chicken contained very sub-standard chicken \"pieces\" and wasn't very flavorful and the roast beef was almost too chewy and lacked flavor.  On the plus side, the baguette was authentic, fresh and delicious but that really isn't enough to carry the sandwich."}
{"text":"Sucks. You ever wonder when you go into a gas station who makes those nasty sandwiches? I found it, they have to make those things at Lees. Bread, old lettuce, some mayo, your meat and cheese, then they hand you a mustard pack? Really?"}
{"text":"love their \"special combination\" sandwich but sometimes the baguettes is a bit too hard which scraped the roof of my mouth and I need a few days to recoup, price is great. Had their smootie and really enjoyed it as well.  only down side is them not accepting credit cards/Debit cards?  so just remember to grab some cash before you head over.   I understand that keeping their prices low means saving on merchant credit card fees, but sometimes I want to grab a quick sandwich...ooofff forget I don't have cash... don't want to get hosed and lose more money to fees at their atm machine which seems to not work the few times I've been in... so I move onto another shop.  All in all, Still love the flavor and food there, will continue to go whenever I remember to get cash.

For the East Valley area with lack of Asian sandwiches it does fulfill my cravings, I've had better in CA other states, but I still like them so yeah I'll keep supporting."}
{"text":"Great service, healthy menu and delicious drinks...what's not to love?"}
{"text":"The bread really makes the sandwich.  Plus not stingy with the meat.  Always very clean.  Fast.  & they have some AWESOME smoothies in cool flavors!"}
{"text":"I eat at Lee's about once a week & would eat here more often if it was closer to my house. I always order the #12 vegetarian with extra house veggies (extra .50) but SO worth it. My guy gets the bbq pork sandwich. I've taken home extra baguettes and they make excellent garlic bread."}
{"text":"So good!!! Very clean and open in there. The bread for the sandwiches is amazing and fresh. The place is cash only, so be prepared!! They are open for 24 hours, in case you wake up at 3am and you're craving an amazing sandwich. A must try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The iced coffee here is excellent.  The sandwiches are great, especially if you prefer them European style."}
{"text":"Great place! Surprisingly good quality food for a chain. Like an Asian McDonald's, except much higher quality. The establishment was very clean and well organized, and even had some food other than they're main menu like Pocky and other brands. (If not a tad overpriced.) I got the vegetarian Bahn Mi, and it was very delicious. As a plus, it came with a free coffee! Everybody was friendly and the order only took about two minutes to make. Definitely five stars, a great experience."}
{"text":"Went for bahn mi. It didn't meet my expectations. Chicken pieces were large and flavor on the bland side. When you've had a good sandwich, you know a good one. Unlikely I'll return."}
{"text":"You guys fucking suck!! I tried to give u the benefit of the doubt. But u fuckers never get my order right.. This is the last time I'm ever going back.. Fuck Lee's and the employees."}
{"text":"Just was in Vegas when my client suggested Lee's... SO GOOD. Very clean establishment, with asian inspired as well traditional sandwiches. They had a nice clean dining, where they also had a bunch other items you can buy, like pastries, fresh baked baguettes and asian packaged goodies... You gotta try... If I lived in Vegas I would be regular customer. BTW. great prices, but cash only... they have an ATM inside, in case you forget."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service.  Fresh food, great selections and the best iced coffees .  We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went there this mornning for a sandwich, knowing as its in the mornning, u think i will get fresh bread. But no. The bread was hard and old. Cant even take more then a bite. Very very very upset and disappointed."}
{"text":"Best boba smoothy I have had!  Must try, go early because for some reason they run out.  Should really knock a few stars off for that reason~"}
{"text":"This place bakes their own baguettes and croissants daily.  Always smells so good when you walk in. Their menus are in English and Vietnamese. Prices are reasonable but cash only. 
Some of my favorites are the tuna almond and the typical club sandwich. Really good authentic novelties to carry out. Good coffee and walk up window is convenient."}
{"text":"We finally made it to Lee's ,with all the hoopla of the grand opening last year  this has been on the radar for awhile. 
     I know with all the bad reviews , I still had to try it for myself. 8:00 pm Saturday night it was pretty empty, more of take out orders then dine in .  
   Wife and I both had smoothies watermelon and strawberry both with boba.  We both enjoyed our smoothies very refreshing. 
    
           We had a chicken and grilled pork bahn mi .  Both sammies were dry needed more mayo, meats seemed pre cooked to me.
       Disregard the Hot fresh bread sign they have , i think it is permanently on , bread was not hot or fresh. 
      
The positives  :  Dining area very spacious and clean!!!
     
The reason for second star bathroom was very clean and not the single person bathroom , I expected when I first saw the door. When I opened the door I really said \"wow\" .  I would give it another star  just for the bathroom ,, but did not want to mislead people who don't read reviews , but just go by star ratings.
      If you get anything from my review it's this , if you have to go potty in Chinatown , Lee's is the place!!!  If you see me at Lee's   I probably just came to use bathroom."}
{"text":"I tried Lee's Sandwiches numerous times before in Orange County (CA), and I was little surprise there was one in Arizona ... I didn't put much hope that it was one of the branch from the original in California, but I was wrong until I arrive. From the store setup to the awesome and delicious breads. Food was great. I was a little bit disappointed that the Vietnamese coffee (bottled version) was frozen, but figured out it might have been shipped frozen from CA. Big giant oven can tell you that the breads baked fresh here. I would recommend Dac Biet or Thit Nguoi baguette, and remember to tell them if you don't want spicy or want vegetables separate if you travel out of town (especially in hot weather)."}
{"text":"Vietnamese sandwich shop. Not too bad. The roast pork banh mi is tender and the pickled vegetables is a nice touch. A little on the fatty side. I remember when this place was just a hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday afternoon to pick up a few sandwiches and some iced coffee. 

Interior was nice and clean. Definitely smaller than the other 2 locations. It was a little hot inside due to the doors being open.

Service was good. The cashier informed us of their grand opening special and gave us 2 flyers to redeem the deal. Since they have been only open a few days, they didn't have their credit card machine up and running yet - so we had to pay with cash instead. 

Food was good. Ordered a Chinese meatball sandwich, a grilled pork sandwich, and 2 iced coffees. Bread was warm and soft with a crunchy exterior. Iced coffee was delicious!"}
{"text":"Depending on what time you go, this could be a convenient place to get sandwiches at. Parking is pretty bad around lunch time til about dusk and it is very hard to get in and out of the plaza. Not their fault though. I stop by here every so often after work since nothing else is open. One thing i wish they would add is a soda dispenser that customers can access for self service."}
{"text":"This place is not the business! The drinks are not even that great. My friend got a watermelon slush and it tastes so fake and literally looks like pepto dismal. The coffee is OK but they put way too much ice in the drinks where ice is up to the way top. Service is not good, the girl that was taking my order was giving attitude. I won't be coming here again. The one in California is way better."}
{"text":"I will never go to subway again! Lee's sandwiches is amazing. I highly recommend the #5 grilled pork sandwich. The price is ridiculously low. A 10\" sandwich was $4."}
{"text":"There is not much on the sandwiches ....quantity wise but they are cheap enough so you can add meat for about a dollar and the prices are still good. They have the best baquettes I've ever had. It's run by Vietnamese make sense the French were in Viet Nam 4ever and taught them how to bake bread. They at one point sold pastrami sandwiches and I'm from NY and a pastrami junkie...the stuff was the best I've had outside of a Jewish deli in Manhattan. It's not on the regular menu not sure if they always have it. You may need to ask."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop looks so fancy inside and outside with flat screens everywhere and high tech registers, you think they would take credit or debit, but unfortunately its cash only. I like how they have a lot of varieties and we didn't wait too long. The staff was alright. We went there around 1am so they looked tired and irritated. We ordered their barbecue pork and special combination sandwich and also the deli manjoo. Their sandwiches were alright. So much hype about it when the bread would cut the roof of your mouth. I would like it much better if they made it less crispy and more soft and warm. That was my only issue about the sandwich, but what do you expect from a sandwich that only cost $3 so I guess the saying goes \"you get what you pay for\"... The 8 piece deli manjoo on the other hand cost more than the sandwich and it was the most DEPRESSING and POOR \"thing\" I ever had. I was so excited when I saw it because its one of my favorites and I always got those at my hometown Guam, but when I got it here there was barely any filling, it was sooo dull, and it tasted old! I couldn't even swallow it, thats how amazingly depressing that thing was. They lost a star for that. This was my first experience here so I think this place was just \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Food was decent and cheap. Had the BBQ sandwich and it was dry. Overall if you have a banh mi craving you can come here"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place.  The bread is so awesome!  Had the #11 combo banh mi and manjoo!"}
{"text":"Note: they are cash only!

I like the iced coffee here...it's a perfect balance of strong coffee with sweetener and creaminess. The taro boba and mango with fruit jelly drinks I tried were not that great...the fruits were tasting overly artificially sweetened. 
The veggie sandwich was lacking toppings overall....maybe we should have asked for avocado on it too (the picture of the veggie banh mi had avocado so I was deceived), but really, there were barely any other veggies, just crispy strings of something soaked in soy sauce and then some carrots and cilantro sparsely placed on the bread. Overall veryyyy unimpressive. 
The pastry puff is delicious.
I will continue coming back for plain baguettes that are freshly baked, iced coffee, and maybe will try the sugarcane juice next time!!"}
{"text":"Too many good Vietnamese foods, this store is super clean and the staffs are friendly and professional... Must come!"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are pretty good. I wish the bread is more similar to the ones that are served in California. The bread here is too hard. It should soft but still gives a little bit of crunch."}
{"text":"Their #66 (Veggie Avocado) is delicious especially with X-Tra Avocado, I recommend you get the Asian combo meal, with 2 egg rolls or chips and you can get any drink for a small up charge of $2.00 wow that's such a steal highly recommend. 

But one time I went there and asked for a large lemonade, little did I know that there was SALT in the lemonade like wtf and then I went to go complain about it and they gave the same drink twice, until 30 minutes into my meal they come out and say \"lol this time I got it right, there was salt instead of sugar in the mix\" at that point my tongue was already numb from the lemon and salt mix they gave me.

They're very pet friendly I brought my German Shepard Misty into the shop and this girl was like \"right on I love dogs\""}
{"text":"Had an employee named Romo, Luis take my order. Probably a new worker because he declined my free coffee order with a purchase promo. Then he also declined a purchase of any sandwich and getting a coffee for 99cents promo. The shop needs to inform their employees better on procedures. Not a bad place but don't give in to the so called \"promotions\" that they won't give you."}
{"text":"There were many customers. It was quick to order and receive our sandwiches. The girl taking our order was so kind to ask if this was our first visit and explained each sandwich and gave suggestions of what we may or may not enjoy since we are not Vietnamese. She even made sure I was aware of what their iced coffee is like before I paid for it. Same girl came to our table after we ordered to ask how we heard about them and that they are new and will get even better over time. I ordered xía xíu sandwich and it was pretty good. Bread very crunchy. I enjoyed it but another at my table felt meat was too salty. I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"I guess this is the place drunk people go to eat after a night of hard partying when they don't really care if the food tastes delicious or not. I've given this place a few tries, but each time I've been disappointed. The meat in the banh mi is almost nonexistent and has a rubbery texture, like it's been sitting out all day. The bread is stiff and hard all throughout when a well-baked baguette should be soft on the inside. Service isn't all that different from a fast food restaurant, you get in line and pay for your order, then they call out your number. I haven't tried their American style breakfast sandwiches, but if they can't even make their Vietnamese sandwiches right, I'm scared to taste their American sandwiches. I'd rather take my money to Hue Thai or Dakao."}
{"text":"It's not bad. I went here for a hobby meet up last Sunday and it was my first time at Lee's. When I looked at the pictures here at Yelp, I was worried that it would be super busy with long lines. Luckily for a Sunday it wasn't. The hobby group I'm in only occupied one table and a few more chairs near the doorway against the glass window. 

I liked how it wasn't just a small eatery but it also had lots of prepackaged snacks and sweets. 

While there I ordered a regular Caramel Smoothie with boba ($3.49), and a Steamed bun with egg and chicken inside ($1.99). I didn't get to eat the steamed bun because it was big and hot (Currenly in my fridge the day after I got it). The caramel smoothie with boba was ok but it took a while to get. I'm glad that they have the number system because without it I would have forgotten about it or wouldn't have heard it on the PA system.
Would I go again? Sure! With a lot of choices in sandwiches and etc there's still plenty of things I'd like to try."}
{"text":"I'm not good with words but the #11 special combo sandwich and spring rolls were DELICIOUS and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I first became aware of Lee's Sandwiches about a year ago in San Jose, California. This one is a little different then the one in San Jose. And can't put my finger on it but it may be that Las Vegas is more culturally designed for tourist. Therefore it may carry over to the culture of the store. Not sure. 

From what I see there are plenty of Asian patrons though coming into the store. 

Lee's offers free wifi and is open 24hrs. There are also miscellaneous snack products on the floor shelves. The items are those specific Asian type snacks. (You the Americanized Asian sweats.) 

As for purchase today, wonderful. The Pate Chaud was fresh and the iced coffee consistent as to the San Jose store. Nice and strong."}
{"text":"Don't bother with the grilled chicken it was mostly bread, the club was better and whats the deal with refills."}
{"text":"so.. whats the big deal about this place?

I guess if you enjoy rock hard bread then this is your place! I was tired of trying to rip my sandwich after the 3rd time. it's just exhausting. On top of that.. theres hardly any meat. 

It gets 2 stars because its clean, bright, and its open 24 hrs."}
{"text":"I'm from the Bay so I've been to Lee's Sandwiches in San Jo...they are quick in service and a lot cheaper. I really like their sandwiches esp. the baguette. I always order the bbq pork sandwich #6.  This location - the lines to the cashier and the wait for you food is so long. I would go back but not if I need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Coffee extremely expensive and horrible taste. Tables dirty and unclean. Overall a really horrible experience."}
{"text":"When it comes to sandwiches, it doesn't get much better than this without going much further and paying much more. The food is ridiculously cheap, but you wouldn't know that just from eating it - you'd have to go to the establishment itself, where the various cost saving measures become obvious. The ambience is non-existent (you might as well be sitting in the middle of a supermarket eating), but it's clean and quick.
As others have said, the baguettes are absolutely delicious, but the drink, meats, and vegetables are wonderful as well.
Unless you're adamantly opposed to sandwiches, meat, or a plain atmosphere you're going to at least like this place."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, fresh bread on the #5 pork sandwich is amazing (bahn mi) so light and simple but full of good Vietnamese flavor. The other speciality teas and drinks look amazing, will explore more on next visit!"}
{"text":"Oddly enough, I like the Eastern location better than Chinatown.  Pretty decent selection of Banh Mi.  I prefer the Lee's Special, the combination, and the BBQ Pork.  Bread is crunchy yet fresh.  Meat is not rancid.  I'm not hard to please.

Their smoothies, however, are not my favorite.  Way too sweet and artificial tasting.  Boba, however, is firm and tasty.  The regular size ($3.29) is more than filling.

I need to try their breakfast sandwiches.  A warm baguette with egg and cheese sounds like an amazing way to start the day.  Maybe tomorrow....."}
{"text":"The banh mis (Asian sandwiches) here are delicious! If you're a beginner, try the #5 (grilled pork). Best. Sandwich. Ever! I also like the #4 (grilled chicken), the #6 (BBQ pork), and #8 (shredded pork). If you're feeling adventurous, try the #1 (combination) or the #11 (special combo). They're a one-way ticket to flavortown and SO good!!! The croissant sandwiches are good too! Oh, and if you like coffee, try the variety of coffee drinks! They are awesome too! Just be prepared for a jolt as they are strong!!!"}
{"text":"Takes more than 11 minutes to make one sandwich. I can't believe they are that slow. There were more than 10 guys in the back. I will not be back. I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"got the grilled pork banh mi and I was in heaven! Good balance of the veggies, meat, and sauces. Bread was super fresh and soft, it definitely was the best bread I've had in a banh mi sandwich. For 6$ you get a huge sandwich, 2 egg rolls, and a drink! Definitely will be back, so delish :)"}
{"text":"Clean place, open late, great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Never again will I go to Lee's for anything. After going to the numerous Lee's locations in San Jose and seeing  how the quailty there is much better than the quailty here in Vegas I will not go there again. The banh-mi is okay but I've had better for cheaper here in Vegas. The Ice with a splash of coffee is severly overpriced. 

The lines are scattered all over the place and the service is lacking. It shouldn't take 15 minutes to get an iced coffee after you've ordered it. 
I'm only speaking about the one here in Vegas.

 The ones in San Jose are great even though the coffee is overpriced. At least in San Jose it doesn't take 15 minutes to get a coffee and they have Bentos you can purchase by the register. 

Check out Dakao here in Vegas. It's a much better option."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. It's super cute and cool and the ambiance is amazing. The set up in the store is modern and clean. It's simple, but nice. And the sandwiches are AMAZING. I would eat here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I've been stopping by after work for several nights now. I like the veggie sandwich (#12) because it has a flavorful mix of veggies (unlike some veggie sandwiches at other places).

The only thing stopping me from giving over 3 stars is the lack of customer service by the cashier. I ordered my food to-go, yet my sandwich was handed to me without a bag. I had to ask for a plastic bag to carry my sandwich. Also, the cashier took the order of the person behind me in line; that was very off-putting for me. My sandwich came out much later than usual, which wasted my time. I'll still probably visit this place, but less frequently due to the service."}
{"text":"I really like what Lee's has to offer and the sandwiches are great. Unfortunately, I noticed a dip in quality and a constant change of faces behind the counter The last few times I picked up a couple sandwiches to bring home. To my surprise, one of the sandwiches had no meat on my most recent visit. Just cheese and veggies. Kind of killed that meal unfortunately. On a prior visit, they only had enough tomato for one of our sandwiches.

Not sure what is going on with this location, but I hope they get it together. They stand out from other sandwich shops on product alone. It's too bad consistency and quality have gone south."}
{"text":"Everytime I go near the East Valley I make a point to stop here.  It's so yummy and all the options...I have tried a limited amount of the sandwiches but as a creature of habit.  I always get the #14 and a jackfruit smoothie if I am really hungry.  =) It's so cheap and awesome.  I am glad they opened one in AZ.  
Bring cash and be willing to try some interesting meats or you can go the safe route and eat the \"Euro\" sammys."}
{"text":"Gross. Previously, I only ordered coffee, which is pretty good, but this time I ordered a sandwich. European Veggie Avocado on a croissant, with extra mayo, to be exact. Was wrong all the way around, skimpy,  and disgusting.. They have zero variety of vegetables, but I get it, it's not Subway. Comes with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, avocado...

My guy picked it up for me, and, being a guy, didn't check to make sure it was made correctly. Instead of a croissant it came on a huge, hard, stale sub bun. If I wanted basically a loaf of bread, I'll go to the store and pay a quarter of the price. Literally, a half a piece of lettuce, maybe a quarter of a piece of tomato, 3 slices of avocado, no sliced pickles to go on the sandwich, only a pickle spear, and I don't know if it was pickled onion or what, but on the side, onion that tasted off . No mayo, completely dry. Absolutely nothing was fresh, and the point of a damn veggie sandwich, is adequate amounts of vegetables. Tasted awful, threw it away. Never again for food or coffee."}
{"text":"Pretty good food if you dont mind paying in cash only, plus there shrimp spring rolls are awesome but they dont seem to be available all the time."}
{"text":"Lee's is a place that everyone in the East Valley should have on their map. Yes, the food is pretty good - but you really want to go here for their bread! That is what makes this place happen.

Now the sandwiches are pretty good as well. It's not a bad place to stop by if it's near by and you want a quick eat. Here is the trick though: no matter what sandwich you order you must \"make it a double\" for about $1.50 more. Without these magic words, and small cost increase, the food is kind of on the light side."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Asian Sandwiches are delish. The taro smoothie is a must. The baguettes are baked fresh and reasonably priced to take home. Everything on the menu tastes great. You will not be disappointed. We come here at least  once a week."}
{"text":"3.5! 

All right... I don't know why Lee's gets such a bad rap. I grew up eating Lee's in NorCal and I will forever be faithful! I LOVE their sandwiches. Their bread is always so perfect, and both the Vietnamese and \"Euro\" sandwiches are good. Delicious chewy medium-quality meat, onions, cilantro... yum yum yum :) Lee's is so comforting and just brings back so many good memories. 

Don't get me wrong, obviously this is not going to be the best banh mi you've ever eaten, and not the best boba or Vietnamese coffee you've ever drank, but it is still so good. Lee's is like your Quiznos. Not the best sandwich you've ever eaten, but every now and then you get a craving that only they can satisfy. 

I was very excited to see a Lee's sandwich so close to the strip, and wow, I must say this location is HUGE, very CLEAN, open 24 hours, and has WIFI! How could you not like this place? 

I'd come to this location to study or get my quick fix of Vietnamese sandwiches. You can't really go wrong w/ Lee's. Please give it a chance!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful break from the same old sandwich options. We love Lees! I get the vegetarian and he gets the grilled chicken. The never disappoint. Just have to watch out for the heat, they are not afraid of spicy hot here. Incredibly delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome, Vegas has a Lees!  Coffee is really good and staff is cool.
Biggest Lee's Sandwich I've seen, and this one is 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are always good. Recently tried breakfast which was good as well. I like the unique sandwich selection and drink selection. I sometimes have a language barrier with the staff and get the wrong order but that gets me to try new things I guess. It's often busy at lunch time and lines can get long. That's difficult when you have to get back to work. Maybe they need to staff up at peak times."}
{"text":"WTF is up with their new policy of adding a quarter to each order item after 9pm??? I have never heard of a more ridiculous pricing structure!!!

Was a decent fan of this place before. Ok sandwiches and iced mochas."}
{"text":"If this is your idea of a ***good*** (not best, because there isn't such a thing as perfect) banh mi, please expose yourself to more locations.

The good things about this place:
+Fast
+24 hours open (when you're still partying at 4AM and you want something, hell yes)
+Bright and clean 
+Clean restrooms
+Spacious, hip furniture, and no shortage of seats! Lee's designer sure knew his stuff. Visually appealing.
+Efficient Service. I like the automatic vietnamese announcer voice that calls your number when you're called to get your sandwich. And then the guy that calls it in english afterward. Cute idea.

The caveats:
-The sandwiches (more on that later)
-Can't charge card unless $20 has been met (there's a handy ATM machine here though!)
-A bit Expensive for Viet sandwiches

The sandwiches here are like fast food to most Viets. Lol it's not the worst, but not the best. It's acceptable. The #11 Special Combo, #1 Lee's Combo, #5 Grilled Pork and #6 BBQ Pork are all okay sandwiches. They all came out THIN, cold, and the quality of the meat is less-than-tasty, like it's been sitting out. At some traditional places, your pickled daikon, carrot slices, and cilantro are placed in a separate baggie for you to put in yourself to your liking. Here, they already place it in for you. Not a huge deal because some banh mi places do this, but it kind of just reminds me of the fast food feel. Veggies weren't exactly fresh. 

The bread is a dry french baguette that isn't made fresh daily, but it's okay. The thinness and the scant flavorings of the ingredients is what bothers me. This place is fast food quality. You could make this at home. Not really worth the price. Maybe it's because I'm used to the traditional places or the ones in Cali that do it right with the quality meats and preparation, but it helps to let people know that this is far from a good banh mi spot.   

Their ice coffee is awesome though. A bit hard to mess up and loaded with ice, but still tasty. I remember when I was younger and ordered one at Starbucks thinking it'd taste like viet ice coffee...I was definitely disappointed! 

I have to say Lee's really knows how to market! I'm pleased that this empire is doing so well. From the first time I experienced in Cali to now (the first one was actually pretty good ages ago), I'm glad that this company is doing awesome. But then again, it's a franchise. Not that that's a bad thing. It's no mom-and-pop contrary to what most people *might* think. But that's like saying that Subway makes the best sandwich you've ever had, in your life, EVER. (I like Subway once in a while...got nothing against them) Or maybe you're happy with that. More power to ya! 

What this place does well is introduce people to banh mi. =] It's just okay, not bad or great, but it's fine for a quick bite. The environment is fun to look at and awesome to hang out at with your friends no doubt. And who can argue with that 24-hour opening especially for late night cravings? Does it warrant a 4-star for the taste and ambiance alone? Nope.

As another reviewer asked, would I go to some hole-in-the-wall over this place for a bit better quality tasting sandwich? Yes. Because it's a huge improvement over the banh mi here in taste and quality; costs just as much if not cheaper; and probably all on the same street (not that much farther than here). It's a simple dish, and I'm NOT expecting gourmet but that doesn't mean you should compromise taste for everything else. I recommend people try other banh mi shops for a better one and to keep an open mind!"}
{"text":"Great variety of sandwiches, both European & Asian styles. I got the #12 veggie sandwich on a french baguette. The bread is fresh & sandwich was good! I love their iced coffee! One of the best ive ever had in vegas. 4 stars because service is kind of slow."}
{"text":"I know that this location hasn't been the best since its newer but i am sure they are working out the kinks. Slowly... but surely... i agree with most reviews that they really arent too consistent but recently the wait for food hasnt been too bad but they always seem to run out of soy sauce and dont restock the utensils. 

However, you have no idea how much i miss eating bánh mì!! I cant find any other good places that make good sandwiches as the Lee's in Chandler is way too far for me and Mekong Bakery in Mesa is good too, but again way too far!

Four stars because im just happy there is a Lee's that is a bit closer to me. I would go every day if i could! They should start doing a reward program!"}
{"text":"I ordered the omplet sanwich but I didn't wear my glasses so I couldn't see clearly the menu.I asked for help and the manager came and talk to me the same way with the staff.he didnt explain clearly.I will not come this place anymore.."}
{"text":"Since I'm returning to Arizona for a week come January, I'm gonna review some favorites from my time in the Grand Canyon state. This could be partially out of anticipation to re-visit places I miss about the Phoenix metro area, or it could be the realization that Yelp allows me to step outside my current East Coast community to provide the straight dope on places I've a decent grasp on. One such place is Lee's, and while this review is being made two years after I left Arizona, I can only hope not much has changed.

Lee's is an awesome little place to grab a sandwich and a smoothie. The sandwich options range from Bahn Li (Vietnamese) to certain basics, but all are unique enough that they taste very much \"Lee's.\" It would be easy to say this is because of the bread, but saying that would discredit the overall quality of Lee's goods. From the fresh tasting filler to the amazingly crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside bread surrounding it, a Lee's sandwich is most definitely awesome. 

But my most common purchase at Lee's wasn't the delicious sandwiches, the kick ass baguettes, or the buttery croissants. There was something else that Lee's provided that was the drink equivalent of crack-cocaine. 

Smoothies - with Boba. 

I've had boba elsewhere, but something about Lee's wide and diverse smoothies selection really made the difference. The boba pearls here were of damn good size and quality too, which is more than I can say for other places that serve them. The only issue is that Lee's would occasionally run out of Boba, but the disappointment was always mitigated because the delicious sandwich was fallback enough.

My girlfriend and I would frequent Lee's when we were both in Arizona, and for the week vacation I'm planning on reuniting with it in grand fashion. Keep your eyes open, guys - I gotta make up for time missed."}
{"text":"Being from Cali Lees Sandwiches is nothing new to me there all over cali. But now that I live in Henderson and to drive across one I was super excite, immediately pulled over bought myself a bahn mi and a taro smoothie w/boba. Not having this for over a year has been such a disappointment.

But now that I know it's here and cheap I will make it a weekly thing until i get to sick of it lol.

Love the decor inside!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are alright. It's made fresh but a bit overpriced. To my surprise. I found some delicious steamed pork buns. These buns were soft and fluffy filed with flavorful meat. This differs from the ones I am used to eating which is typically Chinese/Filipino style. For some reason I am leaning heavily on the Vietnamese style pork buns. I just suits my taste better. I had the pork with egg steam bun and it was incredibly awesome."}
{"text":"Popped into Lee's for a quick bite, we tried the grilled pork and pork meatball banh Mi. Their bread is fantastic! However, they are very light handed with the meat and veggies that fill it. I like a good ratio of meat, veggies to bread and Lee's fails here. The veggies didn't have the snap I like and the pork was pretty bland. It's a shame the filling fell short because the bread was so scrumptious the potential was there. Lee's is cheap, and open 24 hours so it does have that going for it. I'd give it another shot to see if I could find a tastier sandwich."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is open 24 hours is a huge plus for late night owls like my boyfriend and me.  We only ever get the spring rolls, turkey sandwich on croissant, and the pork meatball sandwich.  Yes, they are slow when it is busy but less so late at night.  The biggest bummer is that they started charging per item for orders after 9pm.  Totally not cool.  Didn't seem to stop us though so they still get 4 stars."}
{"text":"went in to order a sandwich, a vegetarian style House veggie sandwich. It consists the vegetable mix that they put on most every sandwich and mayo. I have been ordering this sandwich off and on for over a year.Was told it is no longer on the menu. I asked if they had house veggies, they said \"yes\", asked if they had bread, they answered \"yes\". They would not make the sandwich. Price was never discussed, they just refused to accommodate me. I was not asking for anything that requires more work or ingredients that were not avaliable. in fact almost all the sandwiches come with the house veggies and mayo.  This was some of the worst customer service I have seen in a while. why have a sandwich shop and refuse to make a sandwich."}
{"text":"I order the Asian Veggie sandwich and it was spicy . I really enjoyed it for the first time . My girlfriend order the Asian Grilled Chicken that was better tasting then mines and her bread was warm . Mmmmhh but the best part was the Mango Smoothies if I learned one thing about this place I will always come here for that ... Best Mango Smoothies Ever !!!"}
{"text":"Nostalgia galore! Back when I was a youngster (ok, back when I was like 10-14, maybe not so young) living in Orange County, my family and I would often stop at one of the various Lee's Sandwiches around town, and they were always pretty damn good.

So, when I was driving on the 215 home from California a couple weeks ago and saw a giant billboard with the name \"Lee's Sandwiches\" on it, I was excited. Very excited. So I stopped by after work the following week, picked up some sandwiches and boba smoothies, and brought it all home. The first thing I noticed was that, wow, this place was pretty big! Of course, now that I think of it, the other Lee's Sandwiches were as well, but I had sorta forgotten it. It would totally be a perfect place to hang out with a group of friends, or meet up with someone; conveniently which could be done whenever seeing as they are \"ALWAYS OPEN.\" 

The menu was huge, and to the right there was a large froyo area as well, giving a lot of options, but I was here for the sandwiches, and ordered the BBQ pork, grilled pork, and grilled chicken. 

Got home, split the sandwiches in 3rds and had some of each. They were delicious. But like many others, my gripe comes with the amount of meat in the sandwiches, there's just not enough! I would rather pay an extra dollar and have a meaty sandwich, then have one skimping on the meat. But regardless, $3.50 for a 10\" sandwich is good, and I was quite satisfied. I'm already looking forward to going back and trying their sandwiches.

P.S. According to the wiki on bahn mi sandwiches, the they originate from the French countryside \"salad sandwich,\" so perhaps there's a reason why there's not too much meat. I'll try asking for more next time though."}
{"text":"What has happened to the quality of Lee's sandwhiches? Back in San Jose the food was great. The bread was crispy and light, the sandwiches were stuffed with meat, and the boba smoothies and iced coffees were what us college kids loved to spend our money on. 

I was excited for Lee's to come to Vegas, however, this place pisses on the image of what I remember Lee's sandwiches to be back in Cali. This place has hard bread, filling is kinda bare in the sandwich, the iced coffee should be renamed ice with coffee as my cup was done in like 3 sips (also the ridiculous price they were charging should be a crime), and the smoothies have no taste at all now with gummy boba. 

All I have to say is  BLEH..."}
{"text":"Best cheap meal in town...or is it cheapest best meal? Whichever it was delicious for the whole $4.35 it cost me- and that was including a large pepsi. I have a fondness for pork & cilantro anyway but the pickled veggies and the bite of jalapeno made it even better. I don't mind the cash only policy as it does keep prices down. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great... it's an asian bakery, reminded me of place you could find in Korea (or Vietnam I guess)..... came here for a quick bit before the massage places opened.  They are quick and the prices are really cheap.  Got two sandwiches, 3 iced coffees and a fresh baguette.  The sandwiches are not gourmet or anything, but the bread is nice and it's tasty overall.... the iced coffee was too much ice, but oh well.  don't come here expecting fat sandwiches.. it's just quick/cheap grub... which is sometimes my style."}
{"text":"I've never heard of a large drink being 8oz in a 12oz cup. I asked for ice on the side thinking they would fill my cup and they handed me a 12oz cup that was half full. Very disappointed. Not worth paying that much for ice."}
{"text":"Got the #5 thit nguoi. Very yummy. Toast it. Friendly environment. Looks very nice inside. Ice coffee is yummy as well!"}
{"text":"Great homemade french bread does the job.  The sandwiches are really great. Fresh bread and good meat.  Better than subway or other similar places.  

They only take cash but the low prices are worth the hassle."}

{"text":"I love sandwiches. Lee's makes good sandwiches. From Bahn Mi to Turkey...Need I say more? Ok, I will. They also have great almond croissants (they usually only make TWO per day, so better get one) and other baked goods.Great Iced Coffee and Boba, free WiFi and more. Service is good and those manjoo creme filled cakes aren't bad either...lol"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches in Vegas Chinatown was my last pick after trying 2 other places to get banh mi after 7pm on a Wed night.  We tried SF Las Vegas Supermarket and they no longer sell ready-to-eat banh mi, Dakao Sandwiches was closed.

Lee's Sandwiches is just ok sandwiches but they were open.

Got a pork sandwich w/ pate #17 - $3.95 - tasted just ok, nothing special.  Hate that chewy pork meat that has weird string/fat thing at the ends.

B. got #1 Combination SW $3.95 - he liked it fine.

After tax 2 sandwiches was $8.54.  They have frequent buyer card buy 10 get 1 FREE.

Open 24hrs!!

Their phone: 702-331-9999"}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. I always order to go and although they may be busy the food always comes out fairly fast. I absolutely adore the Vietnamese coffee made hot here. It's quite sweet but it's just the way I love it. I've ordered only off the Vietnamese side of the menu not the Americanized side as I can get those types of sandwiches just about anywhere. I love a good bahn mi  service is always fast and efficient as well."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The bread is super tasty and the prices are very reasonable. I had a grilled pork baquette with mixed veggies. The pork had tons of flavor. 

One note -  be sure to order double meat on the sandwiches. It only add $1 and is well worth it.

Cash only..."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim since we wanted a banh mi but didnt want to go to a pho restaurant. I was skeptical since it had such low ratings but my wife convinced me to go anyway.

First of all there was one guy making most of the sandwiches and taking care of the side dishes like pork buns and sesame buns. The line was and continued to be almost to the door way. We waited for around 15 minutes in line and while there, i witnessed at least 3 groups of customers leave due to how slow the service was. I also need to mention that because its so crowded, the temperature in the restaurant was uncomfortably hot and this is vegas so im accustomed to the heat. It is also very cramped when its busy as well.

The sandwiches were not that great. It was very small for the price and the meat in the combination was thin. The mayonaise overpowered and drowned out a lot of the flavors in the sandwich. The bread was a positive, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the in.

Basically this was a one and done for me. Im sure that they are well aware of how popular and busy they are especially next to the las vegas strip. More workers would definitely make the dining experience much more efficient and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Clean and sterile like an operating room.....

Such a strange feeling to walk into Lee's Sandwiches, which is not quite a yogurt store, grocery store, or a sandwich shop, but some type of odd mixture.  There are overpriced \"Imported from France\" goods for sale on a few shelves throughout the store.  It's a random selection of cookies, teas, and other things you probably wouldn't buy when you're cruising for a sandwich.

The yogurt machines are on the wall, like you would see at a yogurt store, but I'm not sure about the topping selection; it looked sparse at best. 

Now, onto the sandwiches.  The menu on the wall above the registers is big and colorful.  The pictures look exactly like the sandwiches do, which normally would be a great thing, but here it's a disappointment.  I went with the BBQ Pork sandwich.  These are in the style of Bhan Mi, but really subpar.  The bread is missing that great crisp you expect from a baguette.  The flavor of the sandwich was muted as well, and even biting into big slices of jalapenos and bunches of cilantro I couldn't really get into the sandwich.  

There is now a $10 CC minimum if you plan on using plastic, but really, you're better off just going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I don't like to give 5 stars especially when it's my first time somewhere but this place gets it. It smells so amazing when you walk in, fresh baked bread and goodies, yum!!!!!! The menu is expansive and you can find something for everyone. I got a grilled pork banh mi and an order of spring rolls. The banh mi was amazing! Pork was so juicy and tender and had great flavor. The bread was just right: chewy but with that great baguette crunch. I loved the amount of veggies they put on: perfect balance of the flavors and great crunch from them. Good heat from the jalepenos, though I wound up adding hot sauce, too. 

Spring rolls weren't as good as I've had but did not skimp on the shrimp and were tasty enough. Prices are amazing and the food is ready super fast! They also have ice cream which they were nice enough to let me sample. The Taro flavor is awesome! I can't wait to come back and get a cone. 

Note: they only take cash but they do have an ATM inside. Great place and I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been going here for awhile now and have not gotten anything that I don't like.  Bahn Mi sandwiches are good and just recently tried their croissant sandwiches, liked them too.  The best part is the DELI MANJOO.  A lot better than Boba City Cafe, more filling......and most of all.....FRIENDLY STAFF."}
{"text":"What can I say?  The bread is made daily and the portions are reasonable. 
They have a wide selections of desserts,  Asian drinks/candy/food,   and their sandwiches is made when you order."}
{"text":"Came here on a lunch break since I've been hearing from fellow colleagues raving how good Lee's coffee is and the fact that there big in California.

My first impression, real nice and organized inside. Lots of seating and flat screens. I liked how they have a express line for only boba and coffee orders. They have a voice automated that calls out your ticket number when your order is ready. I was a bit thrown off because it wasn't going in order, so at first I thought they skipped me. Perhaps whoever's order is easier to make is called out first. 

I ordered the chicken banh mi sandwich with and iced coffee plus $1.00 coconut waffle. I'm not so much a fan of there sandwiches - bread is hard. The coffee is good- strong. However, they put only a small amount of coffee and then a grip load of ice! The coconut waffle (green) sells for $1.00 in which you can find them in single packages at the front register. My colleague loves it apparently. I don't know what she loves about it though. It was so dry that I literally was about to choke on the piece of waffle bc I couldn't get it to go down! 

I was not that impressed for my 1st experience, but they do have a lot of other choices to try out - so I'll give it another shot. I also noticed they are soon opening a self serve frozen yogurt section inside."}
{"text":"I have never had such a delicious sandwich in all my life. My go to is the #6 BBQ Pork. The crunch of the veggies and fresh cilantro complete this sandwich, all on a freshly baked baguette.  As other reviewers have advised--bring cash.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese Baguettes in town, hands down. They bake all their baguettes fresh daily'; they even have glass doors through their baking process so guests can see it. The meat to condiments ratio is just right for my taste buds. They only accept cash so \"prices can stay low\" (I think that is bogus, though, because they recently increased the price); but they are so yummy, it will be worth the money. Anyway, try their baguettes. My favorite is the Special Combination sandwich which I think is number 11. Pair it with a Viet Iced Coffee to wash down the food. That, my friend, is a great combo."}
{"text":"Soggy bread. It's like it's haven't baked enough. Most of he time i love lees break because it's crunchy. Please see picture."}
{"text":"Food was interesting but good. Prices are a little high for a sandwich shop but I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the grilled chicken sandwiches, egg rolls and spring rolls. The spring rolls were interesting, I was expecting something like an egg roll, deep fried but it wasn't that way at all. They were huge and stuffed to the max. We ended up just pulling out the insides and not eating the casing. The egg rolls were ok.  Overall, ok experience. The place is clean too!"}
{"text":"Let me start this stating by stating the obvious - I am a white girl. I am however a foodie. I was turned on to this place from my nail lady. She's from Vietnam, so I figured she would be able to steer me in the right direction to satisfy my banh mi craving.Steer me right she did.  I had the bbq pork on my initial visit. The bread was perfectly fresh- still warm, delicate crust, light fluffy billowy center. They don't overload the fillings, They are however filled perfectly. The balance between their meats, pickled veggies, cilantro, fresh jalapeno, magic house mayo, and fresh french bread is the thing that inspires symphonies. In summatoin: PERFECTION"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!

At least for now. 

This location just opened, and as such, it is undergoing humongous growing pains. 

Employees are extremely unorganized and undertrained. 

Sandwich came out in about 10 minutes after I ordered and it was mediocre, lacking flavor.
It took another 15mins or so for our coffee to come out.

At this current point in time, I would much rather drive to the Chandler location. 

Hopefully the management can provide more training to their employees so that this location can flourish, because right now it does not live up to the name that's on the door and walls."}
{"text":"ordered lee coffee and is 4.75. I asked easy ice but after finished drink, there is full cup ice left. So disappointed even the coffee is not bad. I complained with the employee and he said they can't do anything. What!!!"}
{"text":"First time here & the place is so interesting! There is plenty of seating and the fresh bread is so tasty! Great desserts and drinks also. Loved the great tea smoothie the best!"}
{"text":"We got there about 45 minutes before they closed. The restaurant was clean. We ordered the grilled pork and vegetarian sandwich. The grilled pork was very tasty but was mostly bread. The baguette was fresh and soft. I still would have rather preferred to have more pork and veggies in it. The vegetarian was ok. It really didn't have a lot of veggies or a discernible taste. Will go back again to try something else."}
{"text":"I love being so close to Lee\"s. However, several times the meat is fatty and with no or one piece of cilantro and missing ingredients. 

Please fix this Lee\"s we love the place but tired of bad sandwiches."}
{"text":"This cash and carry normally delivers decent food at great prices. Same value today, but did not recognize a single person behind counters. When asked if under new management, response was \"no.\" Yet the place is totally backed up and they were unable to even make the smoothies at the same time our sandwiches were up. Something's up. Will be keeping an eye on quality in the near future."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean. The coffee does taste great. This place is open 24/7.
Downside: I have to agree with most of the reviews here. They put way too much ice into your coffee. Their sandwiches are a major disappointment as well. I rather go to Mr. Sandwich. 1 star for the coffee and 1 star for being new and clean.."}
{"text":"I've seen this sandwich place passing by the Chinatown location a lot but haven't tried the place until I saw a location driving by on Eastern in Henderson.  Stopped by to have lunch & my first impression of the place inside was actually really nice.  They had a modern look in there.  Very well put together as far as the foods that are displayed & the seats & tables were nice too.  Also very clean.  I knew what kinds of sandwiches they had so I knew it wasn't your typical American sandwich place.  I was pretty excited that they had some Vietnamese sandwiches bcoz I haven't had a good vienamese sandwich since living in Hawaii.  I had my fav place there & was hoping this was gonna be my fav living here.  Unfortunately, I was so disappointed.  I ordered the #11 on croissant which is like a special combo.  It had like 3 meats (sorry, unsure what kinds of meats exactly but I knew it was pork from what the guy said), the pickled veggies & this spread which I absolutely didn't like.  I found out it was pate.  I hadn't had pate before & it was just.... so gross (to me anyway).  It seriously tasted like cheap corned beef mixed in cheap mayo or something.  I dunno but it ruined the taste of my sandwich big time. =( The croissant was good @ least.  Not falling apart or anything. I really wanted to like it but the pate just did it for me.  Didn't end up eating the other 1/2 of my sandwich.  What a waste!!! I hate wasting food!!  I had to force myself to eat the 1st half of it too.  I also had the iced passion fruit drink.  I'm from Hawaii & the passion fruit drinks I've had, no matter what the place was, @ least it was drinkable.  THIS.... was like way too sweet which overpowered the passion fruit taste.  It was just YUK!!! I can't even explain it.  It cost about $3 so I forced myself to drink that too! Ugh!!! Before leaving, the hubby wanted to try their coffee & THAT I was pleased with.  Maybe a little too much crushed ice but it was some good iced coffee.  I'd go back for that.

Anyways, this is the only reason why I gave the 3 stars.... the coffee.  I love coffee.  I'll give this place another chance tho.  Maybe another kind sandwich minus the pate for sure. HAHA!"}
{"text":"They are cash only but totally worth thus is to keep cost low. I love their sandwiches and their service. They are friendly and patient. The wait for your food can be a bit but I have never received a sloppy or wrong order."}
{"text":"Lee's is great for late night options when no place else is open. They're open 24 hours which means all the viet sandwiches and boba you want, anytime of day. They are like a lot of boba shops with the same kind of food and drinks. Their boba isn't cooked as long which is why I know a lot of people don't prefer their boba that way but I enjoy it! The one thing I'm not too fond of is their bread used on their sandwiches. Depending on what time of day it is, towards the end of the night, I usually get really hard pieces and eat on the insides of the sandwich. Service takes a while, even when its empty. Their card minimum is $5 so if you're only trying to get something small, bring cash with you."}
{"text":"Totally solid. 

At least for the vegetarian bahn mi. 

Tips:
-CASH CASH CASH
-don't go right at lunch time and you will have zero wait
-CASH! Seriously. 
-Grab a croissant and some other super cheapo baked goods
-enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such a bad rating, it is just like any other Lee's and its in the heart of Las Vegas Chinatown. If you can tell me a better place to get a Vietnamese sandwich, then perhaps I could see why you might not like this place but even then, the sandwiches here are awesome. 

Whenever I go to a Vietnamese sandwich (Banh Mi) place, I always order the grilled pork sandwich (thit nuong). This is not to be confused with the BBQ pork sandwich which is made out of the red Chinese style pork meat. The grilled pork is pork marinated in a concoction of lemongrass and various herbs that give it a great rich but fresh taste. That along with the toasted baguette, pickled carrots, radish and serrano chilies make an awesome sandwich. 

FRIENDLY TIP: If you're feeling a woozy hangover from the night before, which can happen pretty often in Vegas, grab a Lee's sandwich and take a bite. I've learned that nothing calms my upturned stomach more than toasted, fluffy bread. Oh and grab a Cafe Su Da (Vietnamese coffee) for the drive home - that coffee was made specifically for champs. :]"}
{"text":"Was so happy when we were driving by and saw this Lee's Sandwiches in Vegas. But everything is more expensive at this location and service is so slow! All I ordered was iced coffee and it took a lot longer than it should. There was a long line and just one person at the register. Randomly the interior is pretty big though and they also sell self-serve frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their sandwiches and coffee. There's nothing better than Lees fresh bread with all the fixings inside. Their bread is so fresh, it's perfect. Blended drinks are great to add with my meal there."}
{"text":"I love all their sandwiches, especially their euro croissants. I always order their smoothie and some sweets along with my sandwich. It has the perfect amount of flavor in each sandwich to make it right. 

The servers are friendly and the place is clean. Pricing is great for what you get. $2.20 for a foot long sandwich is pretty crazy."}
{"text":"This is a good place to go if it's really late at night or early in the morning and I'm hungry. 

The smell of fresh baked french bread and other goodies is heavenly! The food is always super fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. I usually get the veggie bahn mi combo which comes with a drink & small bag of chips for $5.99. It's a decent deal and the sandwiches are pretty big so I usually can only eat half and take the other half to work or home. 

The Asian cashiers are so friendly and helpful and offer outstanding customer service but be warned... If you happen to get a Hispanic cashier and you don't speak Spanish there will be language barrier problems. The past 3 times I've had a Hispanic cashier, they were extremely rude to me! One started speaking Spanish to me and when I explained to him that I didn't speak Spanish, he rolled his eyes, muttered something under his breath and went to ask another Hispanic cashier for help. She was a little more friendly, and from what I could tell was trying very hard to understand me but due to her limited English and very thick accent, I was having a hard time understanding her as well. Eventually I got my order, and of course as expected due to the language barrier, it was incorrect. I had to wait almost 30 minutes for them to fix it. 

The second time, a different male at the counter spoke limited and very broken English. He tried to tell me my sandwich was not available with avocado and I explained to him that even though my sandwich doesn't normally come with avocado, I would like to add it. He then argued with me until the very sweet Asian cashier came around the corner and intervened. 

The 3rd time was probably the worst. The guy at the counter spoke almost no English, was SO RUDE and when I ordered my sandwiches and Buy 2 Get 1 Free Boba he kept messing up the order. He finally got the order right on the screen, but when it came out the cooks had messed it up. As I asked them to fix it, he argued with me and asked if it was okay if I just had the sandwich the way it was. Umm, NO, that's not what I ordered. As I was waiting, my Boba orders came up and sat in the window. Since my sandwiches were taking so long, the boba started to melt and when I finally got my order my smoothies were watered down, melted , warm and nasty. I asked them to remake them and the guy freaked out and said I was being picky. I asked to speak to a Manager and when the Girl came out from behind the back of the kitchen and I explained to her my story she looked horrified. She fixed my order right away and even gave me an extra boba for free. Win! :). 

Overall, my experience with this location is good. I frequent the Eastern location more simply because it's in the same shopping centre as my work and is an easy 5 minute walk. However, This Chinatown location is decent too. It's open 24 hours and has plenty of places to sit, charge your phone / laptop, study or just relax with friends. It can be pretty packed during the day especially around 11am-1pm and 4pm-6pm. I don't mind the wait, but the Chinatown traffic outside is horrible so be warned!"}
{"text":"Cheap and fast. Food and service's only \"OK\". However, they do have pretty good bakery items for a big chain store."}
{"text":"This is a review of the site. I was looking for a place to eat online, but am budget conscious. The online menu has lots of lists of food, drinks, nutrition, and catering options... BUT NO PRICES?! What the heck! How am I supposed to gauge whether this is indeed a one dollar sign restaurant?"}
{"text":"Boo for not having any vegan options, or anyone willing to make suggestions, ignorant untrained staff."}
{"text":"In Vegas for vacation, drunk and starving at the Golden Tiki(which has a fantastic happy hour), and the bartender says to order from Lee's. They delivered in under 10 minutes. Best Viet sandwiches I've had. $16 for 2 sandwiches and an order of egg rolls. Amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mediocre sandwiches.  To much bread and only a small amount of meat.  They don't even taste good at all, nothing special about them.  The Thai tea here is good and I've heard the same about the coffees, but I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! I went a little later in the afternoon and didn't have to wait! Ordered and received my food in less than 5 minutes. This location is way more convenient for me than the Chandler location. Also, their drive thru is now open!!"}
{"text":"So a friend suggested we go to this awesome sandwich place for dinner - the only disclaimer he made was that it's cash only. This wasn't a problem for me, because places that only take cash are usually  less expensive - those credit machines aren't free to run!

The sandwich was good - I had Jambon, Provolone on baguette minus that lovely thing called pate. I'm NOT a fan of pate. It was delish. Tender ham, good cheese, neat atmospher. And they have Jones Soda's - which I always love.

I didn't get to try the DeLi Manjoo, so I'll have to go back! But those suckers look amazing!

Nothing remarkable - but it's a solid sandwich shop with incredibly reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"Service is always great and fast. Food is cheap! Coming from Hawaii and LA, I have been exposed to some pretty darn good Vietnamese sandwiches that feature fried tofu. So being that I've relocated here, this was the only place so far that has authentic Vietnamese style sandwiches. I've had the vegetarian one quite a few times, and although I am super happy with it in general, it does not have slabs of BBQ tofu as I'm used to... I wish it did!! With out a juicy tofu inside, this vege sandwich tends to be dry and lacking the kick and the fillings that I'm used to getting in Hawaii and LA. I get the feeling like Arizona is not a tofu happy place. I very rarely see it on menus as I do in Hawaii and LA. :( I think this sandwich would be killer if they used real pieces of BBQ'd tofu. I'm still happy to go there and get a sandwich since its the only Vietnamese place that offers a vege Vietnamese sandwich that I could find."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm about to hop onto an airplane (do you want your last meal to be crap plane food?), going snowboarding or hiking for the day... this is my go to place to grab a sandwich for the pack.  

Grilled pork w/out the \"mayo\" when it's being packed away (is it really mayo??).  Sometimes the fried 5 egg roll deal comes on the trip too.  Hot summer days is nice to sip on an iced chrysanthemum tea with black grass jelly.

BTW I saw a location just a few miles from Disneyland, if you're planning to pack in a little there too."}
{"text":"When it's good, it's awesome. Fresh bread, excellent Bahn Mi, fun Asian food to check out. 

When it's bad, it's disappointing. Long waits, cold egg rolls, hard bread, \"Pepsi\" products that don't taste anything like Pepsi products.

It's a total crap shoot.
Still... in general, I've had mostly good experiences here, and the prices are decent. 

I like that it's next to Golden Tiki - perfect for when you need a little bit of  food to balance out the booze. And after a tiki drink or three, it's clean..enough. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. But if I'm in the area, it'll do just fine."}
{"text":"It's not all that. I mean for late night cravings for an Asian sandwich it's continent cause it's open 24 hours. There is a $10.00 minimum credit card transaction so be prepared to just carry cash if you're not ordering too much. Staff aren't really that friendly they're just serving the food and then that's it. I mostly get the Asian combo since it comes with the sandwich, egg roll and drink for $5.99 so it's not bad."}
{"text":"Ehhh...I wasn't too impress and a bit disappointed.  I don't know if it was the time we went to there to eat or if this is as good as it gets.  Last time I had a Viet sandwich was when I went back home to Dallas.  I was expecting the meat to be thinly sliced and layered on (like most of american deli's- Subway, etc) and plentiful of vegetable that are either chopped or julienne.  But overall I left semi full and sad; the bread was stale, deli meats were a bit tough to chew and overall the fresh taste of the meat, soft bread and the fresh, crisp sandwich vegetable wasn't there.  I've seen this place packed and everyone seems to eat the sandwiches with hunger delight but it just wasn't there for me. 

And it's a cash only transaction venue was a bit of a turn off.  I may have to continue to look for another Viet sandwich places to fulfill my appetite."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Fast the bread is so frickin good I can eat 2 sandwiches to myself.   I come here all the time and always get in and out super fast. 
Tip get extra vegies totaly makes the sandwich"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 5+years! Finally time review.

Baguette or croissant sandwich? Baguettes are my favorite, croissants are too buttery for me.

Among many options for banh mi, I've settled on the #6 BBQ pork sandwich. I have probably eaten a hundred of them over the years.

Overall, really good place, and I will be back.

Pro tip: don't eat the sandwiches too quick, the crispy crust will cut the roof of your mouth."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Lee's Sandwiches is more known for their delicious coffee than their sandwiches. I really like Lee's Vietnamese coffee smoothie with boba. The boba at Lee's is always prepared perfectly - soft and chewy on the inside! Their coffee is has the perfect blend of a strong with a little bit of sweetness.

Lee's sells Deli Manjoos. These deliciously sweet treats are shaped like a fish and are filled with custard. I cannot just eat one, especially if they are freshly made! Speaking of freshly made, I also buy their sweet coconut waffle. The waffles are green in color but so so good! They make it for you fresh after you order. Yum!

Lee's started selling churro too. I heard they are really good but never tried them.

This Lee's location is large in size but I never see the place completely filled with customers. I have seen the line very long though! The parking lot and parking situation is horrendous but there are 15 minute parking stalls available, which is very convenient."}
{"text":"I usually stop by Lee's Sandwiches before/after doing my grocery shopping at Lee Lee (right across the street) depending on how hungry I am.

I like Lee's because they keep it very clean and organized inside.  They have a nice selection of sandwiches (not just banh mi) and other assorted goodies, plus a bevy of drinks to quench your thirst.

Their ingredients and bread have been fresh every time I've gone in, and what this results in is me stuffing my face, all the while going \"nom nom nom\", and thinking about the ladies from the Nom Nom Truck...oops sorry, I'm daydreaming again!

If you've never had banh mi, you might think that it is weird to get a bbq pork sandwich with parsley, carrots, pickled radish and sliced jalapenos, but I implore you to try one.  You just might not go back to regular sandwiches.

The only downside is that they only take cash, but then again, it ultimately saves you some dough (worth it!).  If you're like me and would rather just not eat than pay an ATM fee, you might not care, but they do have an ATM machine (or two, I'm not sure) if you forget to bring cash."}
{"text":"Staff very helpful,location nice and clean. We had the sugar cane drink and wow, too sweet, but I guess that's what you get from sugar cane. We ordered #1 sandwich and #2, the combination and the special combo. Both were the sandwiches that the staff recommended as their best. Both well priced, and the bread was awesome,(although it was so hard it cut the roofs of our mouths) but the sandwiches were just ok, with bits of too chewy mystery meats. And they both were about the same taste and look.

We had a spring roll which was so tiny...
Overall sadly .... meh."}
{"text":"You definitely cannot go wrong with 24/7 Vietnamese late night banhMi cravings! It's a love it or hate it chain! And I happen to love it! Yes the flavors aren't superb but I can definitely deal with it! I like how the sandwiches are skinner! Makes it easier to eat then the regular thick baguette used for the banh mi like other restaurants. I like it bc I have TMJ (displaced jaw joints) which won't stretch my jaw muscle that wide. They don't put a lot of meat which is fine for me. Like I say it's Vegas late night food okay? They do sell other items besides the sandwhiches! Ohhhh and I'm in love with their Viet iced coffee! What I noticed is that the wrappers for the sandwhich have the name/type of meat you get so it can help differentiate the sandwhich for everyone! We order 6 so to have the name of the sandwhich on the wrapper helped ID each one. Located in Chinatown so parking is okay bc a few restaurant open late night as well."}
{"text":"Quick, delicious, and cheap. The Bahn Mi and Iced coffee is what I come here for. Very light and efficient lunch. My go to spot for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"There Vietnamese sandwiches are average at best.  The grilled pork sandwich doesn't come with much meat and the flavor is off. I come here mainly for the Vietnamese ice coffee.  One of the best coffee in town. If you go in the mornings they have breakfast sandwich and coffee combo.  I like their breakfast sandwiches more than their traditional Vietnamese sandwiches. There are better places in town to get a good Vietnamese sandwich."}
{"text":"I tried their original and pork sandwiches, which were both excellent. The bread was nicely baked and not too hard. The cilantro was very fresh and the meat to brad ratio was great.  I also had the coconut waffle that was yummy too"}
{"text":"This place was so cute! I love how they are set up and they have a variety of snacks and the sandwiches were pretty good too. Overall this place was great and I loved it! ive been here like everyday this week lol"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich place. Some guy was so excited to stand in line for the grand opening his shirt was on inside out. That alone should tell you it's good. 

The line started before 7am. Today it opened at 8am. They started handing out little cups of their signature coffee. My favorite. 

For the grand opening gift, we got a bag, toasted baguettes, a reusable cup, and pour over coffee. Sweet. 

There is a drive-thru. 

Their Vietnamese sandwiches are cheaper than the European sandwiches. For example, the #6 BBQ pork baguette is $4.39. I get extra meat for an additional $1. The #32 turkey and cheese croissant is $6.99. The breakfast sandwiches are cheaper. The #87, a ham, bacon, egg & cheese croissant is $3.99. Their baguettes are great. I like them better than their croissants, but the croissants are still delicious. 

Also, there are vegetarian options. 

I never leave here without getting the pork and shrimp egg rolls. They are $4.29 for 5. Or it's $15.99 for 20. 

The hot wings are 5 for $2.99. I never got them before but I bought them today. They are crispy on the outside, but a little on the salty side. However, it's good.

They have macarons, with different box sizes. I bought the 6 pack for $8.99

They do have a bunch of Asian snacks and bottled beverages as well for purchase. I'm definitely coming back.  

*update. Their drive thru was broken apparently. They didn't have any signs and I couldn't just drive through it, because they had a truck parked on the other side. Backing out of a drive thru sucks.

Also, since this is a smaller one than in Chandler, they don't have all the same awesome stuff. 

And if you have kids there's no changing table at this time."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here. You can get double meat if you like for only like an extra $1. I wish there was one located closer to my house. Every single time I'm here, I always buy copious amounts of food so I can take some home, because it's like an hour and a half away from my house (one way). 

Their baguettes are so crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sandwiches have a good crunch with the pickled veggies and a nice spice with the thinly sliced jalapeños. 

The egg roll filling is a nice texture, not overly salty, and has a good mix of flavors, slightly peppered, with chicken and shrimp. My honey can eat like 10 of them. You can get 20 for $14.99, or 5 for $3.99

Their \"lee's coffee\" which is coffee with sweetened condensed milk is nothing less than amazing. So yummy. 

Recently they started carrying macarons. Best decision ever. I tried the green tea macaron. It was perfect. The matcha was balanced perfectly in the filling and macaron, which a lot of places fail at.

Word of advice? It's cash only. Always bring cash. Their ATM was out of service this time. I had to go to Walgreens next door, and their ATM was out of service too. It wasn't a huge deal, but that was kind of annoying. The limit for cash back at Walgreens was $20, and I really wanted to buy a ton of egg rolls to bring home."}
{"text":"Umm don't know why I never rated this place.  I grew up enjoying the banh mi from this chain back in OC and the angst I had waiting for this particular Lee's was off the scale.  I love these sandwiches!  The grilled pork and bbq pork are my favorite.  And I love the fact this joint is open 24 hrs.  I've come here after work, shoots you'll see me at any given time throughout the day.
    The quality of the sandwiches, the freshness I've grown accustomed to from Lee's is there.  Apply the sriracha and your tastebuds are in for a ride of enjoyment like few others out here in Vegas.  And let me be the upteenth hundredth person to tell you their fruit smoothie bobas are magical!  The frozen boba perfect in this mildy hellish place we call Vegas during summer.
    This place gets a 4 of 5, doesn't matter the time of day, you get a craving for good banh mi at a very reasonable price this is the joint to go to.  It's husky boy approved."}
{"text":"I take a trip to Las Vegas, & went to Lee*Sandwich.  There's really nothing I don't like about this place, their sandwich is outrageously delicious, the bread is always fresh and warm, & the iced coffee is to \"DIE FOR\". Usually after getting my standard sandwich, it's literally like taking a bite of heaven, & seriously their iced coffee is the best iced coffee i've ever had. Oh & it's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches began as a family catering truck business in San Jose and later grew as a franchise serving traditional Vietnamese Banh Mi and European Style sandwich. They are known to make fresh baked baguettes and croissants, they offer breakfast sandwich that is serve all day, and they have beverage like Italian Soda, Vietnamese Coffee, Iced Mocha, Thai Iced Tea, and they make refreshing Smoothies. In addition, they have a small section where you can purchase Asian snacks and additional drinks like Arizona Tea, Coconut Water, Coca Cola, and Energy Drinks. They maintain the place so clean and they do provide friendly service. You can dine in comfortably and watch TV while enjoying your meal. 

I ordered a Grilled Chicken Sandwich ($4.75) Euro Style ($1.80) with Lettuce, Tomato, American Cheese, Mayo, and it comes with a side of red onion, two pickle spear, pepperoncini, and mustard. The Euro Style sandwich is serve on a 10-inch baguette, which I think is a huge serving at an affordable price, but I could only finish half of it. The chicken, however, taste like it wasn't cook long enough. I felt like the meat has no flavor and there are just a few pieces of chicken. The texture of the baguette taste dry and the bread crumbles leaving a mess. There is little mayo in the sandwich, it would have been better if there is more dressing because the bread is thick. And I would have enjoy the sandwich if there is more meat and if the chicken is properly grilled and serve hot.

On a brighter note, I did try the Chicken Pate Chaud ($2.25) which is a Vietnamese golden puff pastry filled with ground chicken. The pastry is so soft and buttery and the meat filling is very tasty. If I knew the pastry is good, I would have ordered two instead of one.  Also I had a Papaya and Mango smoothie ($5.29) and the drink taste so good! I can taste the Mango fruit and its natural sweetness. I wouldn't mind coming back for more of the delicious pastry and to try a different flavor drink. And considering how reasonable the price is for a sandwich, a person can definitely get full ordering a 10-inch baguette. On my next visit I would probably go for a small order, maybe a banh mi or a croissant. Hopefully the next sandwich will taste much better."}
{"text":"Lowering their star rating for having shelves full of expired, moldy mochi.  There is no red bean mochi, and all the peanut mochi is expired, with one package having a spiderweb-like white mole inside.  Some of the sesame mochi had expiration dates of 2015!"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is your best bet for a late night sandwich.  Such a large selection of sandwiches and Boba too.  Lee's ice coffee, if you sip it slow, will last all day, and maintain it's flavor and you can get it premade in their fridge section.  And such a multitude of snack items to choose from.  Bread is always fresh too. After hours are great to stay away from the crowd and Wi-Fi too."}
{"text":"Pork roll with pate! I can eat five sandwiches and still crave more! This is the best sandwich shop ever!! 

When I was younger my parents use to always stop by Lee's Sandwiches during our road trips around California. We bought at least 10 sandwiches on our way back home and they would all be eaten by the time we made it back to Arizona. So you can see how extremely happy we were when Lee's Sandwiches opened in Arizona several years ago.

The sandwich shop is a fusion of Vietnamese and French. A lot of the ingredients used and the stuff they sell including the snacks and drinks are from asian origin, but don't let this turn you away. They have traditional ham and turkey as well. 

Usually I get the vietnamese coffee, but this time around I decided to order the sugarcane drink. It was delicious!! I saw the way they made the drink and it was freshly squeezed from a real sugarcane. I think I found my new favorite drink!"}
{"text":"I would love to give LEE's a 0 but the girl behind the counter was friendly,  however the food was at best a 1, nothing at all that stands out and the value for what you get was next to zero.  For example: my wife ordered a large orange juice and it was a sixteen ounce orange juice and it was given to us with 12 oz of ice and 4 oz of orange juice.  When I asked the girl if that was the large she said she was only allowed to put 4 ounces and had to put the rest ice.   I have never, ever had orange juice with ice.   \"That's the old filler trick, there were no sides even offered as options other than drink.   Long story short DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY AT LEE's sandwiches.  You can do much better in all areas almost anywhere else.."}
{"text":"Decent for the first time. They were very patient with me and my mom asking \"what's that?\" Followed by \"oh.\" Followed by another \"what's that\" and so on and so forth. We also changed our order several times and they didn't roll an eye. All we had (of course we don't know what it was\" was good enough that we agreed to go every time we get out lashes done in that shopping center"}
{"text":"Today  2/20/2017 @ 7:40am and I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches to take to work and as I was eating I freaking found hair in it.. damn it. I never go there again!"}
{"text":"Came to Lee's for just a quick bite and since it would get me out of the monotony that was subway I was pretty excited to try a new sandwich place that wasn't a subway. Came in for lunch and would have to say that the sandwich was just right. It was worth the price and like many other have said their iced coffee is not half bad, getting to the point of being good dare I say. Overall I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The worst coffee ever!!!  I wanted regular hot coffee with a shot of milk no sugar. He reached for a cold jug of pre made coffee (probably instant) and put 1/2 of the cup filled with milk. Then put it in a pot on the stove to heat it to Luke warm. He just couldn't understand.. Whatever happened to regular brewed coffee? And why was it 2.45?  A dollar less would be McDonalds finest. A dollar more would be Starbucks quality. I'll never go there again. It was just out of convenience. Threw it away."}
{"text":"I got the tuna almond euro sandwich on a baguette and it was amazing ! Plus a .99 churro it was nice and warm! 
Took a baguette for home and it was fresh out of the oven.
Cashier was really nice and the service was fast 
Only thing that was not to good was the front trash can looks like no one took it out... Over flowing"}
{"text":"Love  their ham and turkey sandwich with provolone cheese. I haven't tried any of the other sandwiches because I don't really know what they are, but they look good in the pictures.  They also sell pastries. Baguettes, and other finger foods.
The prices are reasonable. Sandwich, soda, and pastry for less than 10.00. 
Service........average fast food restaurant.
The place is always very clean, too clean that you can  probably extend the 5 second food rule to 10 seconds and you'll still be ok.
The  Location  is very convenient for me on my way to and from work since it's open 24 hrs. Only on the weekends I never stop since parking is kind of limited and it gets very crowded for  there are a lot of other restaurants in the same shopping center.
 I really recommend this place. I'm sure you'll  find something here that you like."}
{"text":"My sandwich (#5 Grilled Pork) had almost two times the meat it normally does. 
Still can't beat the flavor and portion size for the price, $3.11 including tax! 
The best thing to do is call ahead and walk up to the outside pickup window. It will save you a bunch of time."}
{"text":"Go here and eat!  They have delicious sandwiches.  Also if you like honeydew, they have a honeydew drink that is just perfect."}
{"text":"I thought Lee's sandwiches is a really worthy chain...until I recently went to this location. I always stop by when we visit home from LA because it's supposed to be cheap and reliably good food like it is when I'm in Garden Grove near LA. But this place has tiny portions! Our sandwiches were a good 3-4 inches shorter, the large croissant was the size of a small one in Garden Grove...same prices because it's a franchise, but shouldn't that mean they have the same sizes too? So sad. Sure it tasted the same but half the appeal of Lee's is the wonderful deal you get!"}
{"text":"I'm in between and 3 and a 4 star rating. The grilled chicken bahn mi was really good. The bread wasn't too hard or too soft/soggy. I thought it was a good balance of bread to filling. The prices are unbeatable, but the service was so slow. I had ordered two sandwiches, and it took maybe 20 minutes to make them...and there was nearly no one in the store.. Fortunately, I wasn't in a rush, but geez..I'm not sure if this would work during lunch time!"}
{"text":"$4 dollar sandwich the meat is chewy and hardly any meat ,give me this sandwich for 1 dollar , I still would not eat it.no customer service."}
{"text":"I heard this place is famous and super popular and everyone always tell me to try it. i honestly was disappointed it just didn't taste like a Vietnamese sandwich to me. I waited forever for my sandwich and it was only slightly warm like they heated up in the microwave. The bread was really hard and super chewy. I got the grill pork sandwich but it felt like I was eating beef jerky cause the pork was so dry and hard. I wouldn't come back here if I wanted a Vietnamese sandwich or Vietnamese food. So I don't recommend coming here not worth the time to stop here or worth spending money for food that isn't freshly made."}
{"text":"Lee's is one of the reasons I carry cash on hand. 

When my hubby and I first moved to Chandler, we would drive by Lee's all the time and always comment on how we'd love to try it because it's so damn bright and enticing. That was five years ago and we're hooked. We take everyone from out of town here to eat at least once. My Korean in laws ask to come here first thing when they visit from Guam.  It's tasty and it's easy on the pocket book. Plus the soothing Asian voice announcing your order numbers is awesome.

My favorite is the #4 Grilled Chicken Vietnamese sandwich. I love the jalapenos, cilantro and daikon radish...gives it such a unique flavor. And the baguettes are awesome. They freshly make the bread right there in the store. It's perfection.

The croissant sandwiches are amazing as well. Big, buttery and delicious.

I also recommend their smoothies with the boba beads in them. I don't know what the heck those little squishy balls (hehehe) are, but they are freaking addictive! 

And finally, get the cream-filled pastries. They are heaven for your mouth."}
{"text":"It won't be the best sandwich you've ever eaten, but you can't beat the price. Both Asian and European sandwiches are dependable, filling, and really cheap. I'd expect most other sandwich places to charge double for something similar. For the Asian, I like the grilled chicken or the lee's special if I'm not feeling squeamish about cholesterol heavy mystery meats. I'm a sucker for croissants, so I also really like the roast beef, turkey, and provolone on croissant. 

Whole baguettes are only a dollar and so fresh that you'll almost always get a hot one. If you're not in the mood for sandwiches, they also have Vietnamese spring rolls which are a bit heavy on the lettuce, but inoffensive."}
{"text":"Cash only! Laughable for a business of this size and presence not to accept cards but not funny to find out after waiting in line for 10 minutes. The cash only sign on the door is barely noticeable but the ATM fee is real."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwich is a simple, convenient, and friendly around-the-clock spot. Whether you're in the mood for something from their sandwich menu, or just stopping in for a quick Vietnamese coffee, they've really always been great. 

*Special shout-out to Theresa who's always provided warm and exceptional customer service!*"}
{"text":"The Taro smoothie is wonderful. The sandwiches are sub-par as they don't have a lot of meat and veggies in them compared to other places I've been to. However, their cheap and the bread, I think, is well-made. This place is open very late or 24 hours. It's a good place for cheap, late night dining if you are sick of the expensive food on the strip."}
{"text":"I was pretty pleased with these sandwiches. Not the best I ever had but was good enough I will hit it again. I have the shressed pork and the bbq pork! Nice.."}
{"text":"They ran out of a lot of their grilled sandwiches so I settled for a combination sandwich. Iced coffee was too sweet. The prices are too damn high! The wait was too long. Worst of all was the bread. I've had hard bread from lee's sandwiches in chandler before, but never this hard. I cut my gums and almost broke my teeth trying to eat this sandwich. Worst lee's sandwiches I've been to."}
{"text":"Iced coffee and Bahn Mi here is amazing. That's all I got during my stay in Vegas. Bread was soft and didnt taste like cardboard. :)  I definitely enjoy the food here. Pretty solid selection of other sandwiches and snacks, as well as a variety of other ethnic drinks. Good amount of seating in the place."}
{"text":"Always consistent.  Fresh great french bread. Parking is horrible.. price is great. Use the  buy 10 get on free punch card"}
{"text":"It's true that Lee's isn't going to serve you the best bahn mi that is known to man, but what they offer up is reasonably-priced, consistently good sandwiches on fresh baked bread. They are always open, so if you are like me - traveling to Las Vegas from the East Coast with a sleep schedule that's completely out-of-whack - Lee's is an option whenever I find myself craving a good Vietnamese sandwich or in need of something to eat which isn't a couple of eggs and toast or run-of-the-mill fast food. 

I've also been enjoying their coconut \"smoothie\", which is much more like a milkshake than anything remotely healthy as one would expect a smoothie to be. The packaged goods they offer are interesting enough to experiment with; I tend to get one or two cookie or hard candy packages each visit to save for later. 

Service is mediocre at best, but it's adequate. I think they do their best given the drunken crowd which shows up past 11PM which is either elated to be fed cheap or obnoxious and too wasted to even remember their visit the next day. Cash only is a disappointment and likely the complaints the staff hear about this policy sours their mood hourly. 

Two-thumbs up and three stars for Lee's. I'm a regular when I'm visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"24HOURS? Wuuut.

I come here to study, honestly. Not so much for the food. Although I tend to always get a boba or some snack of some sort because the snacks are everywhere & they stare at you & they tell you, \"You know you want to buy me... Mmmhmm, I know you do.\".. then you end up buying them. Haha! They also have Deli Manjoo, which I've been looking all over Las Vegas. Service is on and off for this place. Some workers are friendly, some just want you to not be there at all. But either way, I'll stay. Nice spot to study but don't expect utter silence. It could get loud, esp. at night. With all the drunkies craving foooood."}
{"text":"I love Lee's. The grill chicken and grill pork sandwiches are the bomb! The sesame seed balls, bao, deli manjo (not sure of the spelling), and drinks are pretty reasonable and good. I love the chicken egg rolls. I haven't had a bad experience there yet. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Today I went in to order some platters for the party and saw the flyer that had all the pricing on it starting from 28.99 to 42.99.  When I began to ask the guy working the front he told me that the prices would be different than what it said and I said how so and he said that when he puts it in as an order it's going to come up to be a different price so I said how much is the 28.99 one and he said that will be 42 and change.

When I told him they should honor what the sign says he said all he knows but he can't that he just found out that it got changed and I said that doesn't matter you should honor it since it is posted which is usually what businesses do. I asked him if he was a supervisor and he said yes and I said so you will not honor it and he said no.  I think it's horrible how businesses do this to people I just wanted you all to know how unfair it is to up charge just because it's the holidays. I then told him if I order them separately I would still get them cheaper and he said no because they will be individually wrapped and it will not be professional... and I said to myself cut them up and put them on my own platter I think that would be  one of the easiest things to do. So ridiculous"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places ever! They also have awesome chicken wings and a motley of European and Asian snacks/ingredients you can buy. They also bake all their bread fresh in house!"}
{"text":"No free refills on soda.  Rude employees.  Who doesnt have free refills on soda?  Sandwich meat dry.   Unremarkable.  Many other choices nearby....will stick to those."}

Jut had a BBQ pork sandwich very good eating in and getting t go .....also got a tasty steamed Pork Bun!!!  would definitely recommend  for that late nite munchies time or after clubbing......"}
{"text":"2 stars for the baguette. Zero for the sandwiches.
They were just pitiful. 
3 slices of \"meat\" and a few slivers of veggies and 1 sprig of cilantro. The pate' was nonexistent. Won't be going back for anything else except for a baguette"}
{"text":"No!

$10 minimum credit card purchase.

Manager said the sign has been there since they opened ... Not true.

Also, a violation of MasterCard and Visa regulations.

Manager said, \"I'm not going to argue with you\" ... Fine, I'm not going to eat here.:-)

The bread is good... However many better Vietnamese choices in the area.

Update ...

Well it appears the law changed a few years ago. I did not realize now there can be a minimum up to $10. To make it a $10 minimum on a fast food place though is just very poor business practices... In my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Do I like their Asian sandwiches?  Yes.  Their coffee, yes.  Their pastries, sure. 

But this review is based off of a recent experience with their (new?) breakfast sandwich.  Not sure how long they've had breakfast sandwiches on their menu but this was the first time seeing the option since I was last there.

So I came in for breakfast and I ordered a pate chaud and an almond croissant, so that didn't require any waiting.  My boyfriend on the other hand, decided to try their bacon/egg/cheese breakfast croissant.  After ten minutes of waiting, I was getting rather hungry so I started to eat my pastries.  5 - 7 minutes later after I ate my stuff, the breakfast sandwich still did not come out.  This was a 15-17 minute wait already, and the shop was not even busy.  Imagine sitting there hearing number after number being called (EXCEPT YOURS), and looking at people who came in 15 mins after you did, eating their food.  And you are just sitting there wondering where your shit is.  So we get up, walk up to the window and ask where our sandwich is.  The guy at the window states it should be coming out \"soon\" and the wait is due to the fact that the eggs are being made in the back of the kitchen.  Look, if you can't fry a damn egg in under 5 minutes, there is seriously something wrong with you.  If I were the manager, I'd either implement a training on how to efficiently cook an egg or just hire someone else who is more efficient, OR teach your employee to come up with better excuses. 

After being told the sandwich is coming out \"soon\", we waited another 10-12 minutes.  I want to stress that I am not being dramatic about this, as there was another couple who ordered the same thing we did and were waiting a long time as well.  Frustrated, we asked for our money back and were subsequently told AGAIN that \"your sandwich is coming out soon.\" I decided that if \"SOON\" was not 3 mins or less, I'd go ghetto on their ass.  Luckily for them, the sandwich came up a couple minutes after that.  I made it a point to check in front of the employee's face to see if the sandwich was piping hot, which it was, but that only proves the sandwich was recently made.  

Lesson of the day for anyone working in the restaurant industry?  If you forgot someones food, just admit it and apologize.  Don't lie to me.  It doesn't take 30 minutes to put egg, bacon and cheese in between a croissant and heat it up.  The sandwich, I kid you not, was 4x4 in size, with 2 pieces of bacon, some cheese and an omelette style egg. Definitely NOT worth a 30 minute wait, especially in a fast food joint.  We should've just went to McDonalds across the street.  

If I have to stand there and stare you down and make sure that you are making my food, I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"What do you get when the French occupy an asian country for nearly a century? In this case you get a Bahn Mi, asian ingredients inside a baguette. Mr. Lee's was delicious, cheap, and fast. Unfortunately I tried to order the #1 but they were out of certain meats, and this happened with the second thing I tried to order as well. When I got my sandwich it was fresh, and delicious. Viva la Bahn Mi!"}
{"text":"Their Vietnamese Iced coffee is absolutely delicious when they make it right.  However, there seems to be a lack of consistency.  I came here 4 times during my short stay in Vegas and each time I felt the coffee was different.  First time was a little sweet but still drinkable, Second time was absolutely too sweet (felt like all I was drinking was condensed milk-- I even waited for the ice to melt to see if that would help but it didnt and I had to throw the coffee away ), Third time was too bitter ( I let them know it was too sweet last time so they added more coffee and less condensed milk but it still didnt work out), 4th and final time was delicioussssss. I would still come here for the coffee just because I absolutely love Lees coffee and its the only one in the area but just be prepared for super super sweet sugaryness in your mouth!

On the last day, I ordered the special combination ( #11) and the bbq pork (#6)  sandwich.  Special combination had no taste to it.....for the bbq pork banh mi I could only taste the vegetables. 

Customer service was very friendly each time . 

Overall, I would come back just to take a chance on their coffee.  But the california locations definitely taste better."}
{"text":"Lots of kinks in this new location.  Welcomed into the restaurant by powerful smell of gas, but reassured by staff that it's just the way the food smelled.  Really, I just went in there to take advantage of the coupon in the LV Weekly/Seven (BOGO Ice coffee).  Staff was baffled by the coupon and far be it for me to ask them to honor something they didn't understand...but clearly paid advertising dollars for.  

Sticking to Chinatown for the time being..."}
{"text":"I'm still trying to find a decent banh mi spot. However, this will place will have to do in lieu of anything else. I wouldn't eat at Lee's when I was still living at home just because it isn't that good."}
{"text":"Not impressed, in fact I'm rather disappointed.  I really like Vietnamese style sandwiches.  The fresh crusty bread, the varieties of meats and crisp veggies, the pâté--all blend together for an amazingly flavorful combo.  This was lackluster at best.  The bread was only semi fresh, and they didn't put pâté on it.  No pate?! Seriously? Guess what they substituted for the crowning glory of every bahn mi I've ever eaten? MAYONNAISE.  That's right.  They splooged mayo all over the thing, like it was squishing out the other end as I ate.  Ew! I HATE mayonnaise.  Freaking hell.  The meats and veggies were pretty good, but quite skimpy.  The price would have been very reasonable for a decent sandwich, but not for what they served me.  And I really hate to say that, because the folks behind the counter were very nice.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The place was clean.  But the food, the thing I came here for, was lacking.  So its two stars.  In future, I think I'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese sandwiches for a good price.  Get one of their boba drinks and you  got yourself a meal for a really cheap price. 

 Just remember they only accept CASH!"}

I got a barbecue beef banh mi and it only cost me like $3.75!! The bread was perfect, the veggies nice and crisp and the meat was moist and delicious! Get there, NOW!!"}
{"text":"It's good but the bread is a little hard for a baguette. Fountain Pepsi was flat.  Not as many choices as other locations closer to real Chinatowns"}
{"text":"I'm addicted! Great sandwiches, smoothies,  & deserts. Friendly, efficient friendly employees. ;)"}
{"text":"The banana muffins around huge. It is moist and nutty with the pecans on top. It tastes even better with a strawberry smoothie. I've always had this for breakfast and it quenches my hunger for more than half the day.  The baguettes are also amazing.  You can make sandwiches at home your own way or have it with your coffee.  The mornings aren't as crowded as the afternoon which makes waiting time shorter."}
{"text":"If you're interested in trying Vietnamese sandwiches. This franchise is tops. The bread is made in-house. It's unfortunate that they don't have Lee's Sandwiches all across the United States. The sandwiches are made to order, so it takes a minute. It is well worth the wait. Must try their durian smoothie! It's authentic. CASH ONLY.

UPDATE: They lose one star because they close whenever they want. While that's like a boss and all, please don't post a closing time and close 15 minutes before. If you are worried about having customers after closing time, CHANGE YOUR CLOSING TIME!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is huge. Looks like they got more selections than some SoCal locations I've been to.
We stopped by here before driving back to CA on Friday after Christmas. I didn't get anything (knowing the traffic we had to face ahead lol) but my friends all ordered their coffee. One friend is a regular lee's customer, so she knew to order with LESS ICE. The rest were ordering for the first time, so they were disappointed to see the 80:20 ice-coffee ratio lol their coffee is pretty strong tho.. one of my friends let some of the ice melted to water down the coffee cuz he thought it was too strong (he's a Starbucks regular). So yeah.. if you can handle their coffee, make sure to ask for less ice. Otherwise it's not worth it.
We didn't get to try their sandwiches cuz we had late buffet lunch before coming here, but this is a chain eatery so I'm pretty sure their food tastes the same as the ones in CA. I honestly like their baguette.. they use rice flour so it's more crispy than the French one x)
Oh and they also have deli manjoo here. My friends love them.. I think it's okay but then again, don't mind me.. (I don't have sweet tooth like the rest of em lol) they made them there, so you get to buy them when they're still warm :) and they also sell other drinks and prepackaged snacks. 
Whatelse.. oh restroom is regularly cleaned.. and umm parking can be a hassle during rush hour or holiday season.
Hmmmm maybe I'll be back if I happened to be in Vegas and craving for some banhmis. Lol maybe. (I'm pretty sure Chinatown has better banhmi tho.. I mean there's a banhmi eatery too NEXT DOOR.. what's up with that?! Lol)"}
{"text":"Lee's is easily one of my favorite places to get a simple sandwich in the valley. I really enjoy their croissant club, the bread absolutely fresh and wonderful. The smoothies are ridiculous smooth and refreshing, my favorite one is Strawberry (I swear you won't find one chip of ice in the cup!). For the adventurous people they have exotic flavors like Durian. They also serve ice cream, hot wings and egg rolls (not sure if any of that stuff goes together but they make it work). The store itself is always immaculately clean (even the bathrooms, which is important to the weaker bladder individuals like myself). The only downside here is they make you PAY IN CASH! Which isn't too bad considering they have an ATM conveniently located in the restaurant. Save yourself the convenience fees and frustration and have your greenbacks ready before you make the trip out here. Perfect lunch time spot."}
{"text":"I mainly come here for the Asian sandwiches #11(combination) and #6(bbq pork) to be exact.  They are delicious and their service is great.  The only thing I am not a fan of is their eggrolls.  They are crispy but they don't have a flavorful impact when you bite into them."}
{"text":"I can't say enough food things about this place.  My favorite sandwich shop for american or Asian sandwiches. And the market full of Asian foods is fantastic. 

But it's all about their baguettes. The bread, baked at the store, is what makes the difference.  

The very diverse ethnic makeup of patrons is also refreshing.  

Efficiency in ordering and picking up is another positive part of the experience. Oh and it's cheap.  Really affordable."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here. I usually get the euro #23 with provolone cheese. It's delicious. I love that the bread is always fresh and crispy. The place is always glistening and very clean. The people that work here are always nice and friendly. Some of the bakery goods are just \"okay\". The chocolate chip cookie was kind of funky tasting and a little hard. The eggrolls are pretty decent. The hot wings are also pretty decent. The price of things here are fairly priced. Definitely try this place out, especially the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Let's get this straight: almost all the best restaurants in Vegas are in Chinatown, and most of those are within two blocks of the corner of Spring Mountain and Wynn.  Thai-Style Noodle House, Pho Vietnam, Hot and Juicy Crawfish, Yunnan Garden, Hawaiian-Style Poke, and of course the 99 Ranch Market are right there.  Sura Korean BBQ and Cathay House are just a few blocks farther down.

If you're looking for a fast and tasty sandwich in the Chinatown area, this is the place.  get the Asian sandwich.  Make it a combo with spring rolls and a soda."}
{"text":"Came here on July 4th weekend, waited 20mins in line to get grilled pork sandwich and iced Vietnamese coffee, the grill pork on the sandwich was very fatty and greasy, the bread is doughy. The coffee is overly sweet."}
{"text":"I called in and asked directly, the bread has eggs in it and it is not vegan. So please correct the reviews calling the sandwich vegan, or possibly list something on the menu. Many vegans come here and are very mislead into thinking it's vegan."}
{"text":"Fast service, great sandwiches and coffees open 24/7 and can feed a vegan!  Esp delicious if you happen to get a baguette still warm from the oven. Have cash in hand unless you are spending over $20."}
{"text":"they have the STRONGEST coffee I know. I drink a lot of coffe but every time I drank their coffee, I get the jitters. Their sandwiches are alright. I mostly go here for the strong coffee and the Vietnamese desert."}
{"text":"I got the #11 combo, it was good. Everything seemed fresh, and there was a nice spicy kick to it which I like. The bread was soft but overall the sandwich was a bit small. I've had ones that are huge and amazing. I would go back simply because it's affordable and quick. It's simply a vietnamese sandwich which I crave sometimes. The decor is like a bad fast food chain, it's not as nice as the one on Spring Mtn."}
{"text":"Ordered an ice coffee and vermicelli bowl. The coffee was fantastic but the vermicelli bowl was alright. The grilled pork I got in it tasted weird. Will try something new next time."}
{"text":"This was not my first choice to get a sandwich, I wanted subway but couldn't find one because I didn't know the area too well and saw this place instead.

I went in and this place is pretty big and there are a lot of people. Despite this, the wait in line was really quick. I ordered a Turkey and cheese sandwich. Took about five minutes for my order, and when I saw it I was disappointed. There was only the turkey, cheese, tomato and some mayo in the sandwich. There were onions, a pickle, mustard and jalapeño on the side. For the taste it wasn't anything special, I could've made one like this at home....I am disappoint! 

And for a place like this, I was even more disappointed that they only accept cash, weird because they had an atm machine also in the store.
I won't be coming here soon, seeing as this place seems to be working out it's opening glitches. Maybe in a few months."}
{"text":"Service was good. Got the bbq pork sandwich. I wondered why it was so cheap ($4). Once I got the sandwich I figured it out quickly...very little meat! Maybe they need an extra meat option? Not sure I didn't look for it on the menu. Meh."}
{"text":"I'm so excited this place is close to home! We've always gone to the spring mountain location, so I wasn't sure about trying this one.

BBQ pork sandwich was amazing! (Love the freshly baked bread)

Tried the chicken nuggets...they were crispy and delicious.

Taro smoothie was perfect.

The tables could do with being wiped down, but the customer service was great.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Figure I give it another try.  It has been about 2 weeks after my first visit.  Probably, it was the opening week jitters.

This time around, there was not much of  a line.  There were only 3 people in the sandwich shop.  We ordered the Banh Mi - special combo and an ice coffee.  

With no rush whatsoever, it still took them over 20 minutes to get us our orders.  This is quite shocking.  

Once we received our orders, it was another disappointment.  The Banh Mi was pathetic.  Hardly any fillings... a few thin slabs of meat and hardly any veggies and pickled carrots/radish. Bread was cold and hard.  Obviously, it was not fresh.  It concerns me that it was definitely made sometime earlier in the day.  If this was the case, why did it take so long for them to fill our order??? Did they forget?  Go figure... I should not be surprised.

As for the coffee, where is the coffee??? It was like 90% ice and 10% coffee.

Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me for trying this place again.

Never again.  Bad food, bad service, and overall bad restaurant.

By the way, how the heck does this place get an average of 3 stars?  It seems like the owner or their henchmen is putting 5 stars on this place to boost the yelp ratings (note:  you can kinda tell... most of their \"5 star ratings\" have only \"1\" review to their name).  Sheesh.. how cheap is that.  If your restaurant suck, don't try to falsely advertise your failure by boosting your yelp rating..  

Obviously, the management does not have their priorities set.  They should focus on fixing their restaurant and producing a quality product.  Otherwise, no one will return..."}
{"text":"Love this place specially the #DeluxeManjoo I just loved those... I would drop by in the morning just to grab some but not every morning they have it -__- I got lucky the other Time and they were JUST cooking it so I bought 20pcs Hihi my coworkers loved it as well... I also like there drinks and viet sandwich nothing really not to like at this place ^___^"}
{"text":"Yuck. Ordered # 12 veg Asian to go--sandwich was dry and filled with random pan scraps. I usually eat vegetarian food, so I know what's good. Won't be eating at Lee's again."}
{"text":"I came here after being at a restaurant down the building. My boyfriend was craving boba so we walked to Lee's. I'll definitely need to come back to try other menu items but all we ordered was a mango smoothie with boba. I was surprised that across the street at tea of joy, hokkaido milk tea with sea salt cream size LARGE was $4.50 and at Lee's a small mango smoothie was over $5. There were 3 people waiting in front of us so it took 20 minutes for the drink to come out. The smoothie itself was really delicious but the boba was ridiculously soft to where we couldn't chew it. Right when I bit down to eat the boba, it'd almost disappear into my teeth. 
I like that this place is 24 hours so I'll have to come back and try something else on the menu, like the coffee everyone raves about. At 3am it was busy with many groups inside socializing. I also enjoyed looking at the mini Asian goods they have."}
{"text":"Nice find. Sandwiches were tasty and not the usual same old. Prices very reasonable. The place was spotless. The bread was very fresh"}
{"text":"I hadn't gone here in years. I remembered when it first opened and I thought this place was amazing. Then the last time I went here it felt average at best. But not this time, it reminded me of when it first opened. 

Yummy steam buns, delicious sandwich, and some yummy meat pastries. They added shrimp/pork veggie rolls. I recommend going close to when they open, the food seems the freshest then."}
{"text":"You would think that since it is a chain, the foods on the menu would be made with the same quality/guidelines. Nope, wrong. Came in and ordered 2 banh mi and a pate chaud. Damn, I should have taken a picture to show you guys! The toppings inside the banh mi was sooo skimpy!! It was so sad! And the meat ball in my pate chaud was tiny!

This Lee's is skimping on their customers! Of course the 2 stars does not apply to allll Lee's, just this one in particular. I hope the owners/managers read all the reviews and make some changes! Customers would only want to support if the food has quality..and quantity. heheh :)"}
{"text":"Tired of dull subway try lee's. lee is the place, lunch breakfast and after a night out. Baguette are freshly bake. Healthy selection of veggies and meat. the thai tea and Lee's coffee is a must."}
{"text":"Please please do not come here. 
Out of all the places for banh mi in Las Vegas, Lee's is by far is the worst.
Their bread is rock hard, the veggies taste like they've been out for days, and there's barely any meat. Don't bother coming here for the coffee either because its 1/4 coffee and 3/4 ice. Everything is also overpriced.

The place itself is a little awkward. The last time I checked they had a frozen yogurt place on the side but it was closed. I guess its great that its open 24/7 but other than that fact, I wouldn't come here for banh mi. Drive down up the street a little to Hue thai or Dakao for your banh mi needs."}
{"text":"The best thing to get here is the BBQ Pork Banh Mi. It comes with tender BBQ pork, pickled carrot and daikon, jalapeños, cilantro, and a light paté and mayonaisse smear on both sides of bread. The bread is crunchy and all the vegetables are crisp and fresh. The food only takes 5 minutes to come out after you placed your order and it's affordable. These are definitely the best vietnamese sandwiches to get in Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered the special combination sandwich and it was okay. Also, ordered 2 bbq pork steamed buns and they were bland. What really upset me, was the Vietnamese iced coffee. It was good, but almost $4 for a small and they fill it up to the rim with ice! I was able to get 3-4 sips. I would rather spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Lee's is Lee's, came here for some iced coffee and left with iced coffee. The employees were standoffish, they weren't friendly at all. You cant really mess up coffee that has already been premixed from their factory, just pour over ice and viola!"}
{"text":"I have never written comment on Yelp before, but I do consult Yelp often before or after each visit to different eatery places...Decided to start my first review for this Lee's because I felt that I need to do Lee's some justice. I do not get paid to write this review between. Everyone has his/her own preference, and this is just my 2 cents.

PLACE/LOCATION: huge, plenty of sitting areas, free wifi, clean, hip hop music at night, huge TV screens, open 24 hours! (very clean toilets...A+)

SERVICE: everyone is so amicable and gracious...young, polite college students who work around the clock to pay their own bills.

FOOD: I love number 11 (special combo). The baguette is fresh, aromatic, and the taste is enhanced with just the perfect amount of mayo and pate.  I was not a big fan of meat...but this place adds the right amount of meat (sliced not too thin or too thick) carefully curled up inside the baguette and the taste is flavorful, not too salty or too dry. House pickles, cilantro, jalapenos, and onions add the final touch nicely. You could always request what to leave out. There are so many options on the menu that I would come back to try them all. Next time, vegetarian baguette!
There are Asian menu and European menu for sandwiches...serving the diverse community of Las Vegas. Very clever.

DRINK: Smoothies are great. I love the avocado smoothies and sugarcane juice freshly made. I will try the Italian sodas next time! I heard this place is famous for their coffees as well....too good that customers often complain that there is too little amount of coffee...but if it's that good, I won't mind paying for a second one...because it's cheaper than a Starbucks' latte and the quality is comparable!
My friend actually says that there is a reason Lees puts a lot of ice inside their coffees: the dark coffee would melt with the ice so that the coffee would not be too strong, too sweet or too bitter....It's a tradition of coffee drinking in Vietnam.

Overall the experience is great, for a fast food place! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best sub sandwiches I've ever had. The bread is so fresh and delicious.  Pretty much makes the sandwich. They have a lot of options to choose from. They only take cash which sucks because I hardly ever carry cash but when I do, I go here for lunch."}
{"text":"Lees is the place for a great, cheap and fresh sandwich... a couple of suggestions..  They make fresh Baguettes every day and are $1.50 ea. I recommend a smoothie, they are very very good. And dont forget its CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Sooo came here after work (11pm) craving a sandwich and Lee's is both close and 24.

Two people, two sandwiches, one a European combo (they also have 'Asian combo' option which serves 2 egg rolls opposed to chips) and one single sandwich put us out $13. 

Positive:
-Open 24/7
-The Turkey, Ham and Salami sandwich on the baguette.
-Dining Area (spacious with options and wi-fi)
-Baguette's (worth mentioning twice, for sale individually)
-Nice variety of Asian and European sandwiches
-Awesome variety of drinks too; smoothies, all sorts of coffee drinks, Asian Teas and Boba available.
-Those fun, different Asian snacks that you may find at a cultured market, the international isle, or may see at your local Japanese sushi restaurant. 

Cons:
-Our breakfast croissant was greasy (equivalent in price but 1/3 the size to our meat sandwich) and could not stand up to a Starbucks breakfast sandwich enjoyed the day before, which is frozen and then microwaved ingredients.

-Soda Machine behind counter: Whenever I see this I know I am dealing with a cheap, cheap owner / a money hungry establishment. Why? The food cost is all in the cup, the cost of the cup much exceeds that of a second round on fountain soda and should realistically be available for seconds / refills as a service to customers dining in a restaurant. 

-Service suggested staff was no where near a happy group of individuals (excessive sighs, long exhausted stares, disgruntled and impatient tone, with overall disorganization)

-Wait time 10 minuets. Okay so not great, but still acceptable. Probably just seemed too long because we were tired and got our hopes up being number 12 after they called number 11 and then 10, 9, 8, 7,12 ? Okay weird but whatever.

-What I cant get over, the biggest con: a DIRTY DIRTY restaurant. Every booth was disgusting with dirty paper napkins and or cups and each also covered in crumbs. Floor was littered with straw wrappers, cups, and dirty napkins as well. Saw the same staff member walk through a disgustingly dirty area and not attend to or mind the mess. The establishment had 4-5 people visible and working and there was frequently no line. If said staff member had the time to circle around aimlessly, why not wipe the tables, or gee I dont know, sweep? It was obviously not overseen in a rush but a demonstration of poor systems and practice of staff. Bathrooms were dirty too. 


Would I visit again?
Yes, food did not blow our socks off but wasn't terrible, wouldn't mind exploring the options and beverages on menu, Somewhat of a bargain if you know what to order (aka not anything on a croissant) and hey what can I say, even I get dirty now and again, I hope my second trip will be to a more manicures restaurant, because we don't like to eat dirty now do we.

Decent food, 24 hour sandwich spot, loses a star for service/soda machine and one star for cleanliness, or lack there of."}
{"text":"This place is good and cheap.

They get 4 stars from me because of the cleanliness, value, and taste.  There's nothing like this place anywhere near here.

I'm docking them one star because I know what real Vietnamese sandwiches taste like."}
{"text":"Was walking through the shopping center and decided to stop in for a bite.  The atmosphere is great, I had a feeling of being somewhere totally different like I was in a little sandwhich shop in japan at 2am looking for some good food. The menu was a little confusing at first but figured it out and then asked whats good? We were recommended the combination #11. so we went for it. two #11 sandwiches with a soda to the tune of just $10.10. not bad for being 10\" sandwiches! ! So we get the sandwhiches and start eating them only to realize a very different texture in one of the meats. I check it out to that it has head cheese!!! haha I never had head cheese and must say that im glad I didnt know that it was in there because I would have never tried it. The taste was a little strong for me but what got me was the texture and I had to take out the rest shortly after. Besides that the sandwhich was great, meats were tender, veggies tasted great and added alot of flavor to the sandwich and the baguette was to die for!! I would just eat the baguette lol! All in all a very good experince at lee's. Will definitely be back and will explore their menu!"}
{"text":"Not bad.

Actually I didn't like their sandwich when I was in Cali, but this time I kinda liked it here - don't know what made the difference exactly though.

Probably because the baguette was better - was a little chewy, not stale. Value for the price is pretty good.

Also, as with A/C thermo is set at a right temperature and not too cold. This is important if you stay with a laptop - yes, this place offers free wifi.

I'll use Lee's when I have to wait for Samurai Motors across the street to fix my car."}
{"text":"Amazing bread and the iced coffee was to die for! Usually I have to add sugar and cream to my coffee but not theirs. I will definitely become a regular customer of this place."}
{"text":"Don't like their sandwiches but I always come here for their sugarcane juice! $4. Their green waffles is yummy too but it's not always available."}
{"text":"For two of large Thai tea cost almost $12, on the menu is $3 for a large Thai tea, but when I paid to the cashier they charge me $2 more for each large size Thai tea, no reasonable ,  and really bad service too."}
{"text":"We have come here on many occasions for our work team-lunches.. it's perfect because it's walk-up, cheap, lots of options, separately cash orders, and you have plenty of room to sit and enjoy your bread-tastic sandwich with your fellow coworkers.  You obviously know they have fresh baguettes as they are practically made right in front of you (nice touch).  

I do have to say that their sandwiches are OK and not really anything that amazed me or impressed me.. just OK.  In short, it works for team lunches because there are lots of menu options (they have huge croissants, also... yummy buttery goodness).  I have yet to try their Boba, but their variety of flavors did catch my eye.

I did, bravely enough, try their Durian ice-cream.. for those who have never heard of it , it is a nasty smelling fruit popular in Asian countries, though it is banned from public appearance due to it's horrendous, foul odor ... and taste!  Well, you can imagine their Durian ice cream was no different.  We did it more for a dare between coworkers, but I tried it and was disgusted... effin gross, man... that's all I can say (that did not weigh on my 3 star review, in case you were curious)."}
{"text":"Nicest, biggest, cleanest and brightest Lee's ever! Multiple flat screens to keep you entertained while waiting for your orders. There are many choices and the sugarcane drink is awesome! In a place where buffet is at every corner, this is a place to be for choices that fit every budget!"}
{"text":"For a quick Vietnamese sandwich, this is my favorite place to go to. Baguettes are made perfectly fresh, with a soft middle and crunchy outside. The BBQ pork sandwich has wonderful Chinese BBQ sweet/smoky flavor in the thin cut pork. It goes so well with the pickled veggies in the sandwich. The cilantro and the jalepeños adds even more flavor! My taste senses have a party each time I eat one of these. I usually order a boba smoothie to go with my sandwich and their smoothies are consistently well made (no chunks of ice and very creamy). The boba has perfect texture and I can tell they just made it. Free Wi-Fi, clean restrooms and eating area, makes this place suitable for small gatherings. Warning: cash only and sometimes get busy and need to wait for a fresh sandwich."}
{"text":"Good old Lee's Sandwiches. I'll have to say that I am a fan of this place and they have plenty of food varites to offer from. The prices are cheap and the food is filling and its a great place to stop in late night in Vegas if you got nothing else going on or just hitted way to hard at the clubs. =) 

I'll see you again soon Lee's sandwiches. 

Try it out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"We stopped in to get a few steamed buns to take home for a light lunch after having \"brunch\" one afternoon, and I've definitely had better steamed pork buns elsewhere. I was bummed that they were out of the pork bun with egg, so we ordered 2 with just bbq pork. I could tell that they were old in the way the bread broke apart in my mouth, the bun was really dry and the filling wasn't anything special- I imagine they're much better when they're fresh.

We also added an order of 6 of the cream puffs, I recall having them at a little shop in the Meadows Mall years ago and they were delicious, but these one's weren't all that. Very minimal cream filling and the pastry was much heavier (more like a pound cake than the fluffy cakes I'm used to). 

Overall, I wouldn't make a special drive here since the Spring Mountain location is much closer to home, but I wouldn't be opposed to ordering a couple sandwiches here."}
{"text":"Just had my first Experience at Lee's on Rainbow. I can say that the sandwich I order was delicious and exceeded my expectations. The sandwich is not very big but is very flavorful. Price was also reasonable for what you got. I would definitely recommend this location to friends looking for a new sandwich spot!"}
{"text":"I loooove their grilled pork sandwich. Its a lovely mix of fatty pork and pickled vegetables on a crusty baguette. That and a honeydew smoothie is a blastfantastic dinner. But now I am sad sad sad. For the longest time I was fooled into believing these sandwiches were only 300 calories. Thats what it used to say in the nutritional info on their site. Now it says 710. Dagnabit! Makes sense..."}
{"text":"Every time I visit I always enjoy my meal. The croissants are excellent and smoothies cool and refreshing. My favorite is honeydew and I get a BLT on a croissant. I love that the quality is consist and service is fast. Love this place. Try something new today!"}
{"text":"Don't quite understand the Yelp hate. I won't try to get into a battle of words with my fellow Yelpers, because I trust their opinions on many places, but on this one...I respectfully disagree.

Let me set the scene. It's 4:30am. I'm on my way home from the club. I had NOT been drinking, so I was able to judge my food with an able tongue.

Lee's is like your typical Fro-Yo Shop on crack, because it's 10x as big and is actually a Sandwich joint (with Fro-Yo...Yo). 

I ordered the #11 combo, and my sandwich was out within 4 minutes. The baguette was PERFECT! The lunch meat they used was tasty, and I just LOVED the addition of cilantro and jalapeno to the sandwich to give it that extra Asian flair :)

I can't wait to come back. I most certainly was not disappointed. I did not have the horrible experience that some of my friends did. 

I say give it a shot and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"I always love eating lee's late night! It's opened 24 hours and everytime I go I try something different. I love their chicken wings and their European sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I think I'm more with My T. on this one.  I don't hate the place and actually can't help being sucked in by the marketing animal that Lee's has become. The visual overload seems to scream buy me.  We went on Thursday night, so the Lee's head honchos were in all full force getting the place ready for grand opening the next day as well.

Aside from the marketing wonder it has become, I'm with other people on the sandwiches.  They are sub-par.  Every single Lee's Sandwich experience has ended with the roof of my mouth being completely tore up from the hard baguette and disappointed at the filling or lack thereof.  

1.  Thit Nuong/Grilled Pork Banh Mi - Lacked the flavorful grill and sweet flavors that vietnamese grilled pork usually has to offer.  It also seemed like there was only 3 skinny pieces of meat.  Very lacking in filling as with other Lee's experiences.
2.  Special combination (sliced jambon, head cheese, pork roll and pate) - this was more enjoyable for me because it had the nice flavors of all the sliced meats but the hard baguette held me back from devouring the way my hungry tummy wanted to.
3.  Cafe Sua Da / Iced coffee - super icey, but I can't say I hate the flavor.  Just lacked the volume.  It few slurps and it was gone.
4.  Nuoc Mia / Fresh Squeezed Sugar Cane Juice - wayyyy too sweet, like 
unnaturally sweet.

Conclusion:  3 solid stars for excellent effort, but not higher for just mediocre banh mi.  Please, frequent the mom pop's of banh mi places like Dakao for much better banh mi."}
{"text":"Prices increase by $.25 per item after 9pm.. Sounds fishy.

BBQ Pork Bun: Slightly above average. Seemed fresh, the dough was still fluffy and not at all glue-y (you know what I mean). There was a decent amount of meat in it as well. Solid- would order again.

BBQ Pork & Grilled Pork Sandwiches: I felt like there was very little meat on our sandwiches, piled high with the veggie fixings. We ate them, but meanwhile discussed how we should have gone to Hue Thai for that mouthwatering pork sandwich we got there last time. 

The sodas here always have a strange taste. I'm not sure why that it, it almost tastes plastic-y. 

All in all, we might pop by for the occasional pork bun (until I can find a better one elsewhere) but will be taking the rest of our sandwich money over to Hue Thai."}
{"text":"I don't know any other Vietnamese's sandwich , was craving it and bought 5 of them for me and my cousin, so we can eat it all day at the library.. When we opened it and it' was the wrong order, all five of them, didn't realize till we got to school to eat quite annoying. Sandwiches was not that bad. Bread is super hard and scrapped the roof of my mouth off."}
{"text":"This is my backup place for lunch when there is no time for a \"sit down and be served\" type of lunch. You can either eat here or take it to go. Service is very fast.

It's cheap too. I usually get one of the pork Bánh mì sandwiches and a Vietnamese yogurt. It's in a strip mall so there's always lots of parking. Lots of seating inside too - even when it's crowded. They have a TV tuned to a news channel in the seating area. Been coming here for ages."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place.  It's right next door to our dog groomers and their menus online looked awesome.  Boy did it impress.  I had the BBQ pork bahn mi and could have easily eaten another, it was too good.  My friend had the Turkey sandwich (from the euro menu).  He really enjoyed his sandwich too.  While we were there they were taking fresh bread out of the ovens.  I can't get this sandwich out of my mind and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Long line waiting and only one cashier. After 25 minutes wait for five feet, I gave up . Mr. Chieu should hide some more help here!"}
{"text":"I'm giving Lee's 4 stars because I love the service. Food - 3 stars.

The place was empty when I arrived to pick up my order. I was in Henderson & craving a sandwich. 

The employee who took my call was very friendly and helpful. When I picked my order, it was promptly ready as I wanted it. And given with a smile! I'm not sure if I was just expecting less from here. Maybe it didn't sound like they went above & beyond, but I guess I loved that it was fast, uncomplicated, and my sandwiches made as specified. 

As I said early, the sandwiches...just ok in my book. Ordered double-meat on my grilled pork sandwich & still pretty skimpy to me. The vegetarian sandwich was pretty good, and the bread was pretty hard. I halved it with a knife and when that's hard to do, you know the bread isn't soft.

I'm not sure if I'll go back. Maybe, if it's close. The price is good, the service was friendly. Hue Thai probably won on taste."}
{"text":"This is my spot when I want some \"banh mi\" (Vietnamese sandwich). The male cashier is very nice and friendly. Breads are baked/rebaked to order. There are at least couple cookers at a time, so the wait is hardly ever more than 10' for sandwiches. I usually order chicken wings, number 4 chicken sandwich, number 5 Filipino pork sandwich, and number 2 pork roll with paté. My non-Asian friends love number 4 and 5. I personally like number 17 and number 2. Sandwiches always come warm. I like that the bread is crunchy, but not too hard that it would scratch the inside of your mouth. They garnish sandwiches with cilantro, jalapeño, picked carrot and daikon. 
Their chicken wings are so good. They are spicy, crispy, and not overly breaded. One person can easily finish a whole wing order.  
Vietnamese coffee here is very strong. My heart couldn't take it. I tried it once, and don't dare to try it again! Lol"}
{"text":"I did throw the bread to the trash can 2 time. First  was on day brand openning because the bread was made few day before they sell to me, my son got his stomach ache.Second : I asked for fresh bread , but they rehead a old 7016 W POTTER Drone: made the bread very harder, vegetable dry because of heat.I never come back again."}
{"text":"Banh mi are great, get #11 with the pate, the bread is amazing and the sandwiches are large. Sesame balls and steamed buns, iced coffee and macaroons all yummy! AND they're open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"It's not the best, yet it's not the worst. However where else are you gonna get that tasty Vietnamese sandwich in the middle if the night? Plus it's under $5!!!"}
{"text":"I lovveeeeee their banh mi sandwiches, especially the grilled pork banh mi. We stopped in Las Vegas for some food and Lee's sandwiches wasn't a disappointment! The only thing I wished was that the banh mi sandwiches came with more meat, which I paid extra to get. Other than that, it's delicious. The pork steam buns were also amazing! I recommend trying that as well."}
{"text":"I don't like how they brush you off because they have a customer that had the same nationality as them. There were 3 customers in and I was the last one. So they catered to the lady who was I think Vietnamese/Thai first than the fellow who was actually first. I think because the server was also Thai/Viet and they were talking in their native tongue. Isn't it normally a first come first serve basis? The guy was here first and should've been catered first. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place, really good soft bites, and reasonable time to make. Place is new and doing good so they will do very well here."}
{"text":"I've comed here many times for lunch since it's near my job. I order the same thing every time and the total of the sandwich is about 6 dollars and some change. Tonight I decided to stop by and buy a baguette to have with dinner. After I
Order I told me that their card min is 10 dollars. I didn't have any cash so I had to leave without getting what I went to buy. I had just gotten off work so I wasn't really thinking straight and completely forgot that I've purchased thing for a lot less than 10 dollars many times in the past so I called them and ask them if I could pay for a 4 dollar item with card and they said i could. I don't know what was the reasoning for the counter person to come up with the card rule on the spot but next time I'll just pick another place to give my money to."}
{"text":"Open 24/7... We usually come here earlier during the night but this time i just got off from work and was craving some vietnamese sandwiches... The service was very slow and they messed up on my order twice... Its a new lady that took my order... Was rude..."}
{"text":"I am so happy to see a Lees in AZ... for sure will be back for a sandwich and or bread to take home! Gotta love fresh bread!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness...great place for vietnamese iced coffee (which they are known for), egg puffs, desserts and vietnamese style manapua..."}
{"text":"Can't beat a cheap meal here. Composed of asian sandwiches and European sandwiches this caters to both type of palettes. Among sandwiches there are gourmet drinks such as boba drinks, coffee drinks, fresh sugar cane juice and bottled drinks. Viet egg rolls and veggie egg rolls, breakfast foods and grocery odds and ends are also available. 

Bring cash as this is the form of payment to keep these food items at low costs. An ATM machine is available but looked like today it was not working for a couple ahead of me. 

The grilled chicken sandwich with onion slices, pickled carrots slices and sliced daikon, cilantro and jalapeño slices all arranged in a baguette completed the meal. If you're not a fan of spicy then I suggest to immediately remove those jalapeño slices filled with seeds as this will burn your mouth and make you squeel for a minute or 2. 

The turkey sandwich with tomatoes, red onion slices, cheese of your choice can be put on a baguette or croissant. Make sure you check that the right bread was given. Luckily they corrected the issue. 

If you're looking for pate, look no further. They sell a few different brands here!"}
{"text":"WORST LEES SANDWICHES ever!  service sucks and waited for almost an hour for our sandwiches.  we waitied because it was so busy and we ordered 8 sandwiches, gave them some slack.  some dude was waiting 35 minutes for his drink.  after asking them where our sandwiches were they said o we dont have this order.  told them want refund and all of a sudden the sandwiches were ready.  wtf!  we got a refund and that was it.   LEES SANDWICHES LAS VEGAS SUCKS!  I have to rate them one star but if I had a choice they would get ZERO!"}
{"text":"Beware! Has a no gun sign in front. Business does not care about your personal safety."}
{"text":"I'm starting to become somewhat of a regular here. I really enjoy the BBQ pork sandwich,  great price and just the perfect amount of sandwich. Served on a 10\" baguette,  it's got a delicious Asian zesty kick. The iced Lee's coffee is to die for. Great little place to grab a bite; serving both European style sandwiches as well as delicious Asian style fare. Most of the food here is Thai, Vietnamese inspired."}
{"text":"The prices can't be beat. For 3 dollars you can enjoy almost any sub on the menu. The bread is baked fresh and so is the other baked goods."}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas... for some reason, I always have to pick up or stop by to get a Vietnamese sub. 

And of course, Lee's sandwich always satisfy that need. 

Their menu is pretty simple and easy to order. Different type of meat sandwich to pick from. What I usually get is the nem nuong or dac biet. I always have to top it with some banh cam and boba drink. 

You can't go wrong ordering.

Customer services are excellent and welcoming. 

The place is spacious and clean. 

I can't believe it's opens 24hrs. That's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at Lees. The places was very clean. Johnny, at the register, was very polite and knowledgable with the sandwiches. Got a #11 Special Combination. Can't complain. Great sandwich for a great price."}
{"text":"Good coffee but Their unrefrigerated mayo is breeding ground for salmonella.   great place for food poisoning."}
{"text":"I love this chain because it's so convenient and a nice change instead of \"fast food\" but I'm only a big fan of their coffee.  I don't like their banh mi because I feel like their bread is way too hard and hurts to eat after awhile."}
{"text":"The worst! Why are all the Mexicans making Asian food. So dumb. All I went in for was a waffle and they didn't have the batter made or the iron ON! At least let me know and I wouldn't have ordered it! It's 105 degrees out and my groceries are melting in my car! Have some common curtesy to let me know. Dumb just dumb"}
{"text":"Hmm.. came here drunk as a skunk so which means i dont remember anything good about this place.

2 stars because these communist bastards jack up their prices and their quality isn't getting better."}
{"text":"So, I hear there's a grand opening of another French-Vietnamese sandwich joint. I was excited to try their sandwich since I've pretty much grew up with these types of sandwich back in Cali. 

We tried their special combination and iced coffee. Boy, were we disappointed. The baguette were tough and hard, my teeth hurts after a few bites. I had to just put it down. Not only that, but the flavor was really bland. Their ice coffee was decent but it had too much ice. 

I don't see us making a second visit here again."}
{"text":"I didnt realize there were so many locations in las vegas now. I came here for one reason only - the coffee. When I entered, I noticed that they had a fridge to the right side of the store with premade coffee. I didn't opt for these because I wasn't sure how \"fresh\" it would be. I needed some major caffeine because I had a big exam coming up and I didn't want to take no chances lol When I looked at the menu, I had noticed they also had coffee with a triple shot option. I ordered one of these and one of the normal iced coffees to go. Personally, I thought that the triple shot one tasted a little off  - it was really thick, but I still stuck the straw to the back of my throat and chugged it. As I said, I really needed the caffeine to \"help\" me study haha I had saved the normal iced coffee for this morning, and it still tasted good. I chugged it on the way to school. I really like the normal iced coffee better than the triple shot. Just my taste preference though!"}
{"text":"This place isn't bad for a 24/7 banh mi place! But, I've been to other Lee's sandwiches that were better! They always looks like they're short on staff and their service takes really long. I order a banh mi and 2 sugarcanes drink and waited around 20mins when there were only 2 other customers in the shop! The Banhmi was okay, nothing special, I've had better ones. But I love the sugarcane drink! It was just so sweet! I've come here a few times for the drink afterwards and not the food."}
{"text":"This place is alright. I used to love going here, but I've noticed that the quality of the food has gone down.  
I ordered my usual turkey baguette, with a Thai tea and I was really turned off this time. I found an actual hair baked into the baguette. What's even more sad, is that I continued to eat the sandwich and tore off the piece of bread where the hair was because I was that hungry. (Ehh some people have it worse). The tea was not that great either, it it had a weird overly robust flavor, definitely not as good as it used to be. 
Overall, I probably won't come back to Lee's unless it's the one in Henderson since they seem to have better reviews."}
{"text":"The viet coffee was pretty good. It was not too sweet but very strong. It was my first time having it, but I've had the ones they sell at costco. I would like to try a sandwich next time I visit."}
{"text":"Love this place. Cheap and awesome. The bomb Vietnamese coffee and grilled pork sandwiches. I wish they were open late like the one in Las Vegas :-( but the breads are always fresh. The croissants are amazing. Love it here!"}
{"text":"I ordered a large avocado smoothie with boba and it was pretty good. The girl that made it almost overflowed the cup but I didn't mind. The girl helping me was nice and friendly. I'll come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"These baguettes are nothing to joke about. They are as good if not better than any baguette I've had in Europe. I can't speak for anything else here but I'll be back to try."}
{"text":"I live in Glendale, so this is quite a drive for me. But anytime someone needs a ride to/from the airport I am coming here! It's going to be my new thing. I love this place in California but I love this place even MORE in Chandler. Maybe because it's a rare luxury for me but I don't care it's deliciousness in my mouth for $3.50! I like to get #14 and the vietnamese iced coffee, yum!"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches and Boba! the Boba smoothies are a little overpriced in my opinion.  The restaurant is always very clean and open 24/7"}
{"text":"Always stop here when we're in vegas. The boba and coffee is good. Get the special combination!"}
{"text":"I have been here many many times since it has been opened and love the food. They have a lot of offerings such as their bahn mi sandwiches (must try the Vietnamese styled ones), gelato, a hot appetizer selection with pork buns, smoothies, drinks, a small marketplace of sorts, and others. I absolutely love their baguettes when it is fresh. I would recommend trying the sandwiches first and then when you are drawn back, to try everything else. 

The only reason I knocked down a star is the consistency aspect. I have gotten some of the best smoothies and some of the worst (huge ice chunks). The same consistency problem applies to their sandwiches. Usually the baguettes are great, but there are times (especially at the end of the day) where it is stale. The sandwiches normally dont have this problem, but the ones that are displayed by the cash register, such as the garlic bread, seem to have been sitting for a while."}
{"text":"The worst Lee sandwich ever! Waited 30 mins for 1 waffle .. ended  up leaving with Nothing cuz they burnt it and didn't  make another  1 for me. Got 2$ back  after 30 mins wasted.  Warning!!!!!!!! Don't ever go here!!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here numerous times for a quick bite. I love their breakfast croissants and I'll occasionally get their bbq pork sandwich. I love that this place is conveniently open 24/7!

I honestly would pick their iced coffee here over any other chain cafes like Starbucks. The flavor is bittersweet and strong, make sure to get the triple shot! I usually grab one on the way out of Vegas because it keeps me going especially if I have a long drive ahead of me."}
{"text":"I simply love Lee's!!

The sandwiches are interesting; a mix of what you know and what you may not have considered. The prices are unbeatable. This is honestly one of my Drunk Munchies spots :)

One thing I can warn you about: order by number and be careful not to deviate. EVERY TIME i have had done so, the order came out wrong... so I just don't do it any more. The sandwiches and coffees are fine the way they are prepared.

Be aware that this is a combination of various cultural influences. The combinations may not be to every tastes, but I have yet to be disappointed by a breakfast or late meal from Lee's.

GO TO IT!!"}
{"text":"Very efficient, busy busy busy but big space to hang. Crampy parking area.

I'm just happy there was a Lee's here for my Viet coffee. I'm sure all the Pho places have Viet coffee as well but since I chose Korean BBQ for brunch, Lee's was a good pick n go."}
{"text":"No. 5.... Never gets old (grilled beef). The bread is awesome, just the way I like it. Wish it had more meat and jalapeño's and cilantro though, mine was kinda shy of it... They have a yogurt soft served also, but my main visit was for my #5...."}
{"text":"I deducted 2 stars today because they had my food ready but was waiting on egg rolls which they said would take 7 minutes...15 minutes later and three customers that came behind me later....I finally had to yell at them to get their attention since they were so busy talking and chatting they couldn't hear me at first... Because they were being so loud Then when I finally got their attention they were so very flippant about the long wait... No apology.... No nothing.... Just have me a look like I was crazy. They never asked me if it was to go or for dine in. They had everything packed like it was to go. The fourth person that came in after me got their food literally seconds after I received my sandwich... No egg rolls... These I received another 5 minutes after I got my sandwich. So how does 7 minutes equal 20 minutes on egg rolls???

Then when I finally got the food...I was really annoyed about the wait and I let it show... Then they stood there in the kitchen talking about me... Saying things like she needs to chill...Uummmm... Are they really that retarded that they think that I can't hear them over the glass that doesn't even go-to the ceiling. 

They seriously need to retrain their staff... Seeing as how it was a manager that was talking crap about me to one of her staff... NOT COOL. I can say that the manager on duty Mirasol was more interested in laughing and chatting with her male employee then actually doing her job.

The service here has really been off and on.... Now because of this crappy service, I won't come back. If they really don't want my money there are plenty of other places."}
{"text":"This place is money. Seriously ginormous amount of space, It reminds me a little of  a terminal at Sky Harbor for some reason. It is actually very close to where I live, but because my daily commute doesn't directly pass it I often forget about it. This place has the best baguettes in town and everything I have had here is amazing. 

I forgot that they default to American cheese on the European sandwiches, so specify that you want another kind. Side note: Why is American cheese the crappiest of all cheeses?...discuss. 

They also do homemade ice cream which is very good. 

Sandwich, chips and a drink for lunch was about $8.50, but the sandwich is 2 servings for most normal human beings. I always wrap up half for another time. 

If you are a bit more adventurous, try the Vietnamese sandwiches which really is what makes this place shine. Great bread, great meat, great veggies. Everything I have tried has been fantastic."}
{"text":"Big neon sign says \"HOT Baguettes NOW. 

But.. 

No Baguettes available. They are out. 15min wait. 

Buh Bye.."}
{"text":"Lee's sandwiches really reflects the French influence in Vietnamese cuisine. French baguettes,  pate chaud, and espresso. The Vietnamese iced coffee here is the best you can buy. Its delicious, sweet and strong and the pate chaud rivals my mother's. 
Coming from Florida, I've heard the reputation of lees sandwiches so when I found out if be able to visit one while in Las Vegas for vacation I wad ecstatic! It certainly did not disappoint"}
{"text":"First time I went to Lee's I found a hair in my food so I didn't go back for two years went today bathroom was broken place was a mess. Meats bad quality if it weren't for the bread they'd make no money."}
{"text":"I usually stop by here when I am in Vegas. Mostly because of their Iced coffee, and I will buy the small bottles to help me stay awake. The caffeine is strong, but is it also very good tasting and you don't have a huge crash afterwards. So when you have to stay awake, it helps a lot.
The restaurant itself is very clean and there is a lot of space for people to sit. They actually expanded the restaurant, it was much smaller before, and now they made it bigger. It must have gotten quite popular. 
They also have really great sandwiches, different options of breads, meats, or vegetarian. They also make french bread rolls often, you can buy them for cheap if you want. I will usually buy one or two before heading back home to LA, and just stick it in the oven to heat up.
Finally the price is good, it is not very expensive. So after you lost your money (or won) you can buy yourself a sandwich to stay sustained."}
{"text":"I just ate another one of Lee's terrific Sandwiches. Here's a [place that sets itself apart by baking all of it's own bread. That may not sound like much until you bite into a fresh Baguette that wraps around your sandwich. Whether it's a traditional selection, or a grilled pork or chicken sandwich you won't be disappointed.
My Favorite is the Special Combination or \"Dac Biet\" Which is totally different unless your Vietnamese. It's worth driving out of your way just to eat at the terrific Sandwich shop. Prices are very reasonable, the foods great and the service is terrific."}
{"text":"This Lee's location is the biggest and nicest I've ever been to, and my experience here was far better than others'.

Oh buy 4 get 1 free sambo?  HELL YES.  All #1's for me, thanks.  Bread was above (Lee's) standard, and ingredients were fresh.  PIckles needed a bit more time in the vat, but acceptable.

Buy 2 get 1 free Lee's coffee?  How else am I going to wash the sandwiches down?  This location prepares the iced ones the way I like it, and the hot one was not watered down as I've had at other locations (one near South Coast Plaza is the worst offender of both)"}
{"text":"Number six is our choice.   Bread is fresh snd tasty.   Stuffing always good although it will vary depending on who is making them.  Super clean."}
{"text":"What a unique style of sandwich! My friends raved about this place and I have eaten here twice now! I also love how they have other goods in the lobby and all kinds of side dishes! Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Growing up, my parents took me here often. I have always loved banh mi (Vietnamese sandwiches) and this is the best place to get it out. There are a variety of sandwiches, both Vietnamese style and European style. The food is extremely cheap. Banh mi is about 2-3 dollars on average. They also have spring rolls, egg rolls (so good), and other food to snack on. Did I mention boba? Yes, they have all types of boba drinks! But, I normally get the sugar cane juice drink. It reminds me of Vietnam where street vendors sell sugar can juice, which is hard to find here. Give it a try! You may like it! 

Important note: they only accept cash. They do have a atm within the location."}
{"text":"My 5 star rating is for my Banh Mi pork barbeque and my Vietnamese Iced Coffee. It's always been consistent and delicious."}
{"text":"After all the hype, I am sorely disappointed. My #17 sandwich tasted like raw pork, and there was hardly any meat or anything else for that matter.  The chicken wings tasted like factory made chicken substitute.  This must be likened to something like a mcdonalds, all flash but no soul."}
{"text":"Lee's sandwiches are lee's sandwiches iam just excited I don't have to drive all the way to China Town to get my Viet Sandwich fix...Yay!!!"}
{"text":"It is a place for Vietnamese sandwiches and the price so cheaply to get you full for your lunch! I came here sometimes for my sandwiches and liked my special sandwich with everything on it! The customer services were very nice and you didn't have to wait to long for your sandwiches! If you like Vietnamese sandwiches and here is your place to be!!!!
I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"For $2.55, you get a pretty decent sized pork roll sandwich.. although the baguette ratio is WAY bigger than the meat or veggies inside. Mostly bread.

They only take cash.
And the ATM machine was out. 

....um. Not good.

Windows & Doors are in a desperate need for a good clean, smudged handprints everywhere kinda gross me out.

Tip: Go get to the Walgreen's next door, buy something and get cash-back that way. Saves you a trip to the bank.

Value is good but I really wish they can make these improvements!"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is a chain that specializes in sub-style sandwiches with an Asian or Pacific taste.  They offer a good alternative to subs as opposed to the more traditional American types, and I think the biggest draw for us is the bread, which is sub-style and fabulous.  Some of the sandwiches they offer up are more European flavored, and we've tried a few of those, but they're a bit more \"traditional\" and didn't quite tickle our tastes the way the Asian ones have.  Prices are pretty reasonable -- especially given it's mostly a sandwich shop -- but be warned: they do not take credit card ... only cash.  Very spacious place to eat, and usually we haven't had to wait all that long for our subs."}
{"text":"Had tried a few of their sandwiches in a LA branch a while back and decided to give this place another chance.

#11 Special Combo: Reminded me of one of those Banh Mi Vietnamese sandwiches (veggies herbs and different meats). Not too Bad but far from great.

#5 Grilled Pork: slices of pork were bland, I think the medley of veggies and herb were tastier?.. I like the BBQ Pork better, it has a little more flavor.

Pork and Chicken Egg Rolls: Both missing flavor but I'd take the pork over the chicken

Iced Vietnamese coffee: Strong, Sweet and quite tasty. This should wake you up!

The highlight of this place would be their Bread. Their Bread is pretty good much better than what they stuff in them.... If your looking for quantity over quality for a budget price, then this place maybe your solution!"}
{"text":"The place looks nice and clean, but the service is not that good; it takes a long time for the orders to be fulfilled. They don't even tell you when your orders are ready; just place them on the counter."}
{"text":"I really wanted their coffee, it had been a while. And I couldn't believe their response when I told them why wasn't the large filled. \" Thats per the manager. Sorry\" Wow . So yeah I won't be back. The difference between large and regular just don't get either one. Even when You ask  for less ice. #leessandwiches #ripoff they didn't use to be like this #lasvegas"}
{"text":"Dropped by Lee's before my long ride back to LA. First of all, no sugarcane juice here. So disappointed. Only in China town location.

I don't usually get coffee from Lee's but I got coffee this time. I asked for less ice for my coffee so it wouldn't be diluted as much and they wouldn't fill up my coffee even I paid $5 for it. It was 3/4 filled up. Smh! 

Apparently the coffee isn't freshly made. They pour it out of their coffee concentrate in a bottle WHICH you can also buy. Anyways I'm gonna stick with China Town location."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST iced coffee in the history of the world!!"}
{"text":"So being a self proclaimed Lee's snob I walk in skeptical.  I've eaten Lee's all over California, Lee's in Milpitas my fav.  I've eaten Lee's in Las Vegas and Chandler, AZ.  Nothing can hold up to that Norcal Lee's experience tho.  

But Lee's in Peoria AZ has given me a glimmer of hope.  I walk in and there is actually 1 package of spring rolls out for sale on the counter.  A phenomenon I had not yet seen at a Lee's outside of Northern California.  

At this point a single tear drop rolls down my face. 

Because I now know in my heart I am about to eat a KICK ASS grilled pork bahn mi, prolly 3 tho.  I am a little disappointed there aren't any green waffles out, but it's late on a Sunday so we'll give it another go another day.  No nuoc mia either!!!!!!!

LISTEN TO ME WHEN I SAY THIS LEE'S SANDWICHES ARIZONA PEEPS ARE GOING TO GO APESHITZLES FOR FRESH SQUEEZED SUGAR CANE JUICE IN THE SUMMER SO START GRINDING THOSE STALKS AND PRINTING MONEY.

AND DAMMIT HAVE SOME GREEN WAFFLES OUT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Uggg.  All Lee's are not created equal.  I guess I'm a little bit of a Lee's snob after having worked in San Jose for 3 weeks and eating it almost every day.  I got the grilled pork and I think it was just cut up cheap ham.  I was horrified at this abomination of a Lee's after having talked so much shit to my wife about how good it was.  It was painfully all right.  No green waffles, no chuoi nep nuong, no assorted treats layed out just so.  Not a young coconut in site.  They did have the fresh squeezed sugarcane juice I have come to love.  But it still has nothing on Nuoc Mia Ninh Kieu's sugarcane and kumquat explosion.  

I sadly went away with a large baguette and the hopelessness of knowing Arizona is missing out big on the REAL Lee's Sandwiches experience and that is a mofo shame..."}
{"text":"Cashier shanne needs to be train more. Shes very confusing. Gets phone call while she getting orders from line.although there was other staff by her. Dont feel like greeted or they're friendly. Foods ok. Coffee is awesome"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend and we each had a child. My friend managed to get us a booth. There was a line from the register to the door. Not bad for the second day. Ordered two combination sandwiches and a vegetarian sandwich. Also bought a hot fried pork roll, a pate chaud and 6 sesame red bean balls to go and got two of the free ice coffee drinks. It took them awhile to get our sandwiches ready (expected that on the second day) but once it was, I really enjoyed the combination. My one suggestion is to spread a little more pate and mayonnaise onto the bread. My pet peeve of the chandler location is that there's never enough pate and mayo spread. Sometimes I have to buy more on the side, I wish I didn't since it's already expensive. This new location can use a little more spread as well. Brought the veggie sandwich home for my mom. The hot fried pork roll was great and the pate chaud was good except the meat inside was small. Overall...be a little generous with preparing your food and you'll likely have more returning patrons."}
{"text":"Soooo good!

I'm so sad that this is the only Lee's in the valley and that I live far away from it...I would go all the time otherwise.  I had the #5 Grilled Pork Sandwich, and it was so satisfying, and lets not forget that they are under $3....take that Subway.  The #5 comes with thin sliced, marinated, grilled pieces of pork, with carrots, cilantro, jalapeno, onion, and mayo...on a delicious, fresh baked baguette.  Also had a mango smoothie with boba, and it was really good.

Really don't understand how anyone could give this place a low rating.  You will not find food this tasty, for this cheap at very many places.  Only downside I can think of is cash only..."}
{"text":"After living in the Bay area for 6 months, I was aware of Lee's Sandwiches as a chain. But somehow I never made it in to visit. I was pleasantly surprised to see their familiar store fronts when I relocated here- and finally swung by this evening for dinner.

Pricing and variety are good, with both European and Asian sandwich options- I chose the #6 bbq pork, and added on a 5-piece order of hot wings for $3. Not bad at all. Total order was under $8 and even though signage is posted about $10 minimum for credit cards, I was not hassled.

As I waited for my order, noticed several other menu items I'd consider coming by for in the future: steamed buns in a warmer by the front counter, various Asian grocery store snackfoods, and cold coffee drinks available with boba- yum!

Order was up quickly, sandwich was gigantic  (10 inches!) and wings were tasty. Considering they were \"hot\" wings, flavor was not spicy at all, but they were not bad. Sandwich was large enough that I barely managed to eat half of it, though a good inch and a half at each end was just bread and no filling. Way too much daikon was on my sandwich, giving it a mostly sweet taste with no attempt at balancing flavors- bread and sweetness overwhelmed."}
{"text":"If this was my first time having Vietnamese food, I'd never have it again.

It's not just how obnoxious the exterior is, with the ultra-strong lights that probably drive every insect in a ten mile radius to the store front, or how unnecessarily large the place is - but it's the mediocrity of the food and the stinginess of the restaurant that really just earns it a low, low rating.

Their baguettes are ho-hum, the amount of meat per sandwich is underwhelmed by the pickled veggies, and while the price is great I'd much rather go to Mr. Sandwich and pig out there.

When I say stingy, I refer to their iced coffee.  I love Vietnamese coffee (strong Vietnamese coffee individually dripped with condensed milk and it's delicious and nom nom nom and really should be a dessert), 70% of that cup is ice, the rest is yummy Vietnamese coffee.  Want more?  Ask for low ice and what do they say?  \"Sorry, pre-measured, I'll have to charge you twice.\"  Seriously.  I'm paying three bucks for three slurps of coffee?  I can go around the corner, go either side to Pho Kim Long or a five minute walk and get some Vietnamese coffee for a full serving!  

Their spring roll looks like it had two shrimp and some real veggies in there.  It's allll laid on the top with the shrimp sliced in half.  So it's nothing but filler.  Where's the taste?

I was informed that they used to have really great food in California about ten years ago.  I dunno what happened, but wow.

However, I will give it to them - Interior is super squeaky clean, modern, and ultra-bright, as I mentioned, as well as 24 hours."}
{"text":"Here's the deal about lee's.  The sandwiches are indeed good.  Not all of them, mind you, because I don't think I'll ever recommend a sardine sandwich to anyone, ever.  But this is a place where you know that you're gonna get a cheap and very tasty lunch.  The croissants are delish and even the baguettes are great.  Also they have a frozen coffee drink that I hear is top notch.

Bring cash, that's all they take.

Look, it may not be ritzy *dallas g.* but you're no aristocrat either.  So don't look down your nose at Lee's--this fat person is rarely wrong, and never about food."}
{"text":"In an attempt to justify eating 1.5 sandwiches before noon, the boyfriend and I ambitiously decided to bike to Lee's from Tempe. (OK, I am embellishing. We don't live super far, so it wasn't an incredibly long bike ride.)

As far as chains go, I really love Lee's Sandwiches. This venue was bigger than most and had a huge array of snacks and smoothies. Extremely clean and well-maintained, and fast service.

The only con was that I couldn't find any bike racks and I do wish there was more of that mayo-butter concoction on the sandwiches. It would be cool if they were open past 8pm too. Also, I couldn't find any bathrooms?

Definitely better tasting than Mekong Sandwiches, though! I think it's because of their bread. Lee's Sandwiches are overall a bit smaller than Mekong but the taste of their baguettes is remarkably better.

One last note: I freaking love how Lee's provides their nutritional information online. Yeah, it's probably not exact, but still nice! (Not that I like it when MyFitnessPal tells me I've eating 110% of my calories by 12pm, but that's what being 4'10 and hungry does to you.)

Biking to Chandler to stock up on some delicious Vietnamese french bread sandwiches is definitely going to be a new weekly tradition."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite go to everyday type of place.  Lately I have been getting the French sandwiches although the Vietnamese sandwiches are totally kick ass.  The bread is the key, baked all day.. it's real French style baguette.  The smoothies are also very nice, I recommend honeydew with boba."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, even awesomer considering the price! $3 or so for a satisfying lunch. The baguette is one of the best I've had, baked fresh with perfect crisp outer shell and soft inside. The #5 I tried had slightly sweet pork which went well with the slices of pickled veggies and jalepenos. Will have to try the coffee and sweets next time!"}
{"text":"This place rescued me from homesickness.  It was about a week after our move from L.A. when I found this place.  I honestly didn't think place like this existed in AZ.  

*Bread = very good.
*Sandwiches = My fav are #6 bbq pork and #11 combo special
*Lee's coffee = mmm....good :)
*pastries = they are good but had better.
*Boba = ...not so good
*Drinks = they are ok."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches isn't my #1 choice of Vietnamese sandwiches or food, such as steamed buns, pate chaud, or egg rolls; however, it's close and convenient to where I reside so it will cut the craving. 

A couple things that I do recommend with confidence is the vietnamese coffee and fresh baked baguettes! Not only does the coffee taste good, it really does the job and keeps me up for hours! As for the baguettes - they're sold fresh, soft, and warm. When I have no self control, I could find myself snacking on the whole baguette before my mom is even done preparing our meal. 

Tip: Lee's was a \"cash only\" establishment for as long as I could remember - but upon my visit today, I was informed that they do accept card now!"}
{"text":"I love the bahn-mi . I wish they kept the sugar cane juice plain with no added yucky spices which ruins the flavor"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I can't review the sandwiches, however i hear they are fantastic. I love all the grocery items for sale. The racks are low and easy to see and access. They have green tea Pocky...a great gift for my nieces who love that stuff! 
I get the shrimp spring rolls in rice paper. They said they are gluten free and I believe they are. They taste fabulous. I crave them. I haven't tried the veggie spring rolls yet, but next on the list. 
The place is tidy and welcoming. There are so many things I have yet to try. I want to try the coffee drinks and the boba drinks. 
I recommend this place to grab some lunch, coffee and some take along treats."}
{"text":"Walking by and decided to see whats in here... Nice place and well kept.
After figuring out this place was more than a sandwich shop, I walked out with 2 bagguettes of the best bread ever, hot and fresh out of the oven, definatley be back!"}
{"text":"Try the bbq pork sandwich... yum!! Gotta get extra meat though.  They have lots of yummy treats too. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Do you like coffee?

Do you like actually staying alert for those extra needed hours of a cram sesh before a test or a god awful double shift in retail?

Go to Lees and order the Vietnamese iced coffee. Lawd have mercy it is like the holy grail of legal stimulants. 

For my health conscious friends, forewarning that this bad boy has probably a half of cup of sweetened condensed milk in it but it's totally worth it! It's soo delicious and yes you will stay up allll night. If you work at a normal time in the am do not drink one of these after three because you will not be sleeping until 130am - true story... Oh and the sandwiches are really good too!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of Lee's but it was conveniently located two spots down from Pho Kim Long.. we figured we would need some substance to bring back to the hotel room to eat prior to drinking a massive amount later on in the night. We each picked up a sandwich and two others also got spring rolls.

The sandwiches were ALRIGHT.... you have to keep in mind the quality is going to pretty much suck, since it's a chain restaurant. The spring rolls were pretty bad... never had any like it.. they used shredded up lettuce.. cha siu (bbq pork) and shrimp. They were pretty gross but hey... you'll eat anything when you are drunk.

The interior of the place is really big and very nice. There is so much seating that the place looks like a ghost town but A+ for the effort they put in building the place."}
{"text":"Let's get something out of the way, I Love Lee's.  I'm a native of CA and just a recent transplant in AZ so when I saw Lee's I just about creamed my pants.  Lee's Sandwiches is a familiar face and staple from home, the Bay Area CA.  I was impressed to see that they had expanded their market into AZ (they have over 10 locations in the Bay Area alone!) and happy to have a taste of home nearby.  As per their usual setup there's a machine rolling out fresh baguettes while you wait.  The sandwich varieties is extensive though I always go with the traditional banh mi pate.  The fresh dishes they have saran-wrapped in the front are a must as well.  You can even take 10 baguettes home for a $1!!! Ridiculous but true.  This particular Lee's also has desserts - they have a bunch of bobas and frozen yogurt.  I highly recommend, just bring cash as they don't do card."}
{"text":"My family and I frequently visit this sandwich shop whenever we're near the area. The shop is clean, tidy, and has plenty of tables for those who are looking for a very casual dining experience. The baguettes and croissants have always been warm and  freshly baked on every single of the visits I have made here. I personally like the Turkey Club and Bacon Sandwich (with your choice of it being on a baguette or croissant) and costs about $6. My only complaint is that there usually isn't very much meat on the sandwich in relation to the bread - oh, well. They also serve ice cream (the vanilla fudge with M&Ms is my favorite), smoothies, and other fun little drinks. The service is usually always very decent as well. 

Be sure to bring cash, this place doesn't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a nice Lee's Sandwich branch, like those I often visit in Orange County, California. It is clean and organized. I'm taking one star off because the Lee's iced coffee drink that I got was 90% ice and 10% coffee (see picture). I finished it with 3 sips. Initially, I didn't want to say anything to the store, but my friends urged me to and one of them talked to an employee at the pick up counter with me. The employee, she, told me the drink was made by a new employee who didn't know the steps well and filled the cup w all ice. I was disappointed but still gave it a 4-star because the second employee went back and gave me a free refill. Thank you, the second employee. Sorry I didn't get your name."}
{"text":"I can't believe there's now a Lee's Sandwiches within a hop, skip and a jump from me here in Chandler.  I usually get my Viet-Sammy fix at their location in one of the grittiest, seediest parts of SF. 

In fact, I haven't gone in quite some time because I hate that part of the city, so now that they're nearby in Chandler, I'll get my fix while I can, even if their sammies are skinnier than those in sF.  All good though, since for these prices, I can just pig out by eating two.  Talk about changing demographics!!

Good times guaylo!!!"}
{"text":"Well, I love Vietnamese Bahn mi's and Vietnamese food in general, but Lees has such an extravagant menu and plenty of options even for the picky eater . 

I ordered the #5 combo - Th?t Nuong ( grilled BBQ pork ) on a baguette- pickled carrots, cilantro and jalapeños . Yum in my book! It also came with two egg rolls and I upgraded my drink to a Lees Vietnamese coffee ($2 more ).. If you've never had Vietnamese coffee , proceed with caution ... It's basically liquid cocaine, but sorry guys no cocaine just strong coffee & sweetened condensed milk, I believe . 

Food and coffee overall was great like always, but the bathrooms are disgusting.. Shoe marks everywhere, toilets unflushed and overflowing trash cans. I know girls bathrooms are messy and sometimes gross in general but this one needs to some attentive and diligent cleaning ."}
{"text":"We come here a lot. I have a tomato allergy. I asked for no tomatoes. They gave me tomatoes. I sent  it back. She literally picks them off, and gives it back to me. The tomato juice is still there. They smile obnoxiously in the kitchen as my boyfriend brings it over to show them. Really professional. Apparently they do not care about food allergies. We got our money back and left. Never again. Bad service. And no regards to health issues. Thanks for another bad experience guys. ;)"}
{"text":"I go here for the coffee. I've had the sandwiches and they are not at all bad. 4/5

The staff is so friendly. The coffee is on point. The place is not that busy and open 24 hours so it's ideal to write or type or hang without drinking alcohol. 

To me, they have the best caffeinated coffee- it's so strong."}
{"text":"Love their bread! I've had better Vietnamese sandwiches but this hits the spot when you're in need of a quick fix."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a whole lot of the different sandwiches but so far it's been good. I just wish they could put more stuff in the sandwich but for the price I guess it's ok. I really like the pickled veggies they put in there! I've had the coffee flavored smoothie which was strong, good but strong! I didn't like the taro boba smoothie, it was too sweet! 
I will definitely go back and try the others. 
One thing though, every time we go there and look at the menu, not standing in front of the cashier, we always get asked what we want. Uhm, we're still looking? I don't have the menu memorized so I don't really know what I want. But it never fails, they always ask when we're still looking, even when there's no one behind us (I'm thinking they want us out of the way because other people are waiting, right?). That's not something that would keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"What happened to the Spike Lee picture for this joint? :/

The fact this place doesn't take credit cards at the register but has an ATM machine in the corner charging $2 per transaction throws this place down to a 2-star rating! Boooo! 2 stars for mediocre food and the cash only feature could be a turn off for those who don't carry cash. Cool place to hang out with a huge group of friends until the late night cuz it's open 24 hours!

Follow the 2 stars down the street for better banh mi..."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The special combo (#11) was the best. Inside we got the mayo, pickled vegetables, and a varieties of meat slices. The balance between the acidity from the pickle and the sweetness from the paté and mayo was spot on, couldn't been better. Also the fresh baguette was so good even when eaten alone. Try this place if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Feels like a typical Lee's but not as many options as the ones back in CA. I don't like how they became corporate and started mass producing their products, losing some quality along the way. The original in San Jose is still the best. 

That said, it's nice to see some familiarity and success of the franchises around the country.  Sandwiches are still cheap (although prices seem to increase every year). I like their baguettes when hot out of the oven.  Otherwise it gets stale and hard pretty quickly. Lee's coffee is the same. Super concentrated for those who can tolerate it, but the cup is stuffed with ice. 

They were also a lot slower than they should've been."}
{"text":"Monica, manage to take my order with out saying hello, zero communication skills and no eye contact.

 I wanted just meat and cheese... she responded twice with the same wrong answer, \"baguette turkey bacon\". I corrected her politely and told her what the correct order was.

My food of course was incorrect... I go back and I finally get her to look at me and I say, \" I am sorry but this isn't what I ordered...\"

Long story short, I asked for a refund because all they did to fix it was take 5 mins to wipe off the mayonnaise from the sandwich.

They called the manager over in perfect English, where she then spoke to her manager in Spanish... 

the manager even pointed it out automatically what I was talking about 

They gave me the money with out even an apology. Sad"}
{"text":"This is the largest Lee's Sandwiches I've been to and it's even open 24 hours! The sandwiches are pretty good, especially after being in Vegas for more than a week, and eating too much American food. It could do with a little less butter in it though.   Their iced coffee was good but quite strong, even after all the ice melted, it still tasted the same to me. I don't think the iced coffee is worth buying, being as it costs about the same as a sandwich."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying it's better than average. What's better? The flavor of their coffee. It's dark french roast with chicory and sweetened condensed milk. The same syrupy milk used in tres leches cakes.

This style of coffee is commonly served with beignet in N'awlins. It takes a little more sophistication to recognize this because people think SBucks has good coffee. Wrong! 7-11 serves better tier coffee than SBucks. So learn a little something and go for the coffee.

They also make baguettes fresh in the store. This is the perfect vessel for your perfect sandwich."}
{"text":"I love the vegetarian and vegan sandwiches that Lee's sandwiches offers. They are so filling in so delicious and are so super affordable for a quick lunch or dinner on the way home. The staff is always so friendly and the place is always so clean"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this morning because I liked their sandwiches while I visited southern CA. Obviously this was a mistake. I ordered egg, ham and cheese on croissant with Lee's coffee. This had to be the worst croissant sandwich I ever had. The whole thing was cold and tasteless. The croissant was dry, flat, not even close to taste like one. The egg was bland. The food left unpleasant taste in my mouth for hours and undigested. Perhaps if I would have ordered the sandwich on a baquette, it would be better, but I won't be back for breakfast here any time soon. If anything worth your money, the service and coffee are good though. If you want a croissant sandwich, go to BK instead."}
{"text":"There is a bread machine in house! When I say bread machine, I mean industrial strumpf! It smelled of steamed pork buns when we entered, so my plan of just getting just a bahn mi was out the door!

First off the steamed pork bun was ridankulous.  

I ordered the combo #11 and a thai iced tea.  The sandwich was not as full as the picture would lead you to believe, but the sub was still tasty; crisp veggies, tasty meats and crunchy, fresh-baked bread. Thai tea was perfect.  Over all awesome sammiches but........

CASH ONLY! so leave that plastic at home."}
{"text":"First off, I am not here to talk about their Banh Mi. Personally I don't like their Banh Mi at all. 

Although, they have very good snacks here. Banh Cam, Banh Bao, Smoothies and Teas are also good. They do up their prices compared to California franchise but I can understand why since these are probably imported from else where. 

The space is small and they have a in and out kind of line. You order at the front then pick it up at the very end. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely to try their other food but personally I would stay away from their Banh Mi."}
{"text":"It's Lee's.  Solid variety and will hit the spot for hunger.  Huge plus for being 24 hours.  We had a couple day trips and swung by before 9 a.m. to get our sandwiches and food for the road.  Always reliable."}
{"text":"I love almost everything about this place. Their coffee and smoothies as well as their sandwiches. It's almost always fresh. Rarely have their sandwich bread turn out a little stale. I've ran into results like that. Not often but there's a small chance. Other than that it's really good. I would always go back. Their pricing is good. If you like strong coffee, try theirs."}
{"text":"The bread though.
Good, moderately-priced sandwiches. I tried the grilled pork. Loved the baguette, loved the pickled veggies (would have loved more), didn't love the pork. It wasn't bad, just very mild in flavor and had an interesting texture. My hubby had the club sandwich which was great. 
Excellent, friendly service. Vietnamese iced coffee is STRONG and yummy. 

I'm just dying for an awesome banh mi joint. Hoped this would be the place, but I actually like their \"euro\" sandwiches better."}
{"text":"Best iced coffee I've ever had.  Combo sandwich is amazing.  Bbq pork sandwich is Delicious.  my husband sometimes Gets the american sandwiches which are pretty dang good as well.  Fresh baked bread and butter (I could eat a pound of their butter in one sitting).  Delicious smoothies.  Pork pâté chaud pastries are amazing as well.  Cheap cheap prices. (Foot longs for $3!!)  I usually buy at least 3 sandwiches: one to eat immediately, one for later in the day snack and one for next days lunch but have a really hard time not eating the second one before I get home!  I live in tempe but will often take the 40 minute round trip drive to lees when craving a special combo or the pork pastry.  The fact that lees doesn't have a current 5 star rating for quality and price is a travesty."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great prices and great food. It's a little different but I like some original!!! See you again."}
{"text":"I used to live in Orange County where Lee's first started to populate.  This Lee's sandwich is over priced (Most likely because it's Vegas).  It looks like kids are running this place.  They don't know how to offer service.  Lines are unorganized; can't tell who is up.  Pick-up is a mess as well.  Their sandwiches are the same as the other Lee's.  Must eat right away otherwise the baguette will harden.  Usually get the Special and it's average; bread wasn't warm at all.  Coffee was over price; should have went to Starbucks for that price.  Parking is a pain in this are with Hot n Juicy a few stores over.  

Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"They're aiight . Sandwiches can take too long at times and sorry lees but no matter what state I'm in anytime I'm in one of your establishments it's stinks bad. For that reason I stick with the American sandwiches plus they're good"}
{"text":"We usually go to Hue Thai, however it's on the other side of town. So with that said I got the house special at Lee's on Eastern & Serene. The bread was excellent, meat, pate, & vegetables were delicious. I rally don't have anything negative to say about them. The price was fair & the decor very simple but nice. Go try it if your in the area."}
{"text":"C'mon! Fresh sandwich lunch for $3? The place makes it to order, incredible variety of baguette style sandwiches. Cash only, but the have an ATM in the lobby with a low fee. Or is it no fee? Anyway, great coffee and drinks and teas. Line moves super fast. Number pickup system is funky. My family packs these things to take home on the plane!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are fresh, tasty and cheap. The Baguettes are made on site and you notice it. The sliced peppers in the sandwiches are a bit spicy, but that makes them better in my opinion.

This is a place for a quick bit. It feels a bit industrial, noisy and busy. However, they seem to be very efficient and the restaurant is extremely clean. 

It is cash only, but that shouldn't be a problem since the prices are so cheap.

Also try the spring rolls, mniam mniam!"}
{"text":"Grand opening is today, May 14, 2017!  Free gift to the first 100 people.  I came here around 7:15 AM and had no issues getting my gift.  The place is actually really small, but the layout is actually genius because it snakes around to the door on the other side, making for an in and out experience.

The sandwiches here are small and way pricier than California, I guess I've been lucky with the huge sandwiches there, but I get it, this is Arizona, so they have to account for transportation of goods etc.

Grand opening featured a dragon dance, ribbon cutting, and freebies such as buy a sandwich and receive a baguette or iced coffee for free. 

Overall, there are possibly 6 tables and it's very small.  Prices are much higher, but the taste and quality is the same.  Finally, it's open!  Expect long lines and slow service as they work out the kinks, welcome to this side of town, Lee's."}
{"text":"Good spot for a no fuss quick lunch. I think I was fortunate to arrive at Lee's when they just brought out fresh bread. It makes their simple bahn mi go from a 3 star to a 4 star sandwich. Unfortunately, you need to eat this sandwich in one sitting or else the bread will go stiff and in this case stiff isn't a good thing. I don't know why but I like their pork and shrimp spring rolls better than their sandwiches. If you haven't tried it, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Great that this place is open 24/7. Their viet iced coffee is bomb whenever you need a pick me up. I always get mine with boba because I can eat boba with anything! There are multiple locations in town. Their banh mi sandwiches are not bad. This specific location also sells different asian snacks n drinks. Parking can sometimes be limited in this plaza."}
{"text":"This place has great bread. Their baguettes are nice and crunchy.  Their sandwiches are reasonably priced . Their meat portions are a little small I recommend maybe an upgrade but they add picked vegetables and some jalapeños to make a very tasty.i sandwich. Their croissant are some of the best in town the only drawback they only accept cash service can sometimes be a little slow"}
{"text":"There's a Lee's in SF and it's pretty gross, so I don't know why I even bothered. 

The place smelled like Pine Sol and vomit.

The Tofu Bahn Mi was gross. The veggies didn't seem fresh and the bread was way over toasted, so I was left with something very dry, almost powdery once bitten into. I was hungover and starving, so I tossed the bread and ate the stuff inside. Still gross.

It was my homegirl's birthday, so I hassled the kid behind the counter about giving her something and he gave her one thousand sesame balls. They were chewy, old, and missing the essential bean paste inside.

I hate you, Lee."}
{"text":"Good banh mi, good coffee, good chicken wings, good spring rolls, an open 24 hours. Great alternative to generic fast food."}
{"text":"Love their crescents. The baguette is crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. Their smoothies are sooo creamy and yummy... I've tried the banana, thai tea, strawberry, honey dew, watermelon... I always get #33 i believe. It's a crescent wit ham, turkey and cheese. mmm soo yummy... Even their french horn is yummy..

Overall i love coming here. Just wish it wasn't thaat far.. lol.. I'm on DI and maryland and it's on spring mountain and decatur. 

But SO WELL WORTH THE DRIVE... :)"}
{"text":"Anyone who thinks that this place is good has never had a good bahn mi.  They are terrible here.  If in Las Vegas try Dakao and you will get the best bahn mi around."}
{"text":"I used to like this place but I ordered boba once and it was not fresh. And also I ordered fresh spring rolls and they took it out of the refrigerator and I asked if it could be made fresh and they said it is fresh and just made this morning. Well it wasn't fresh. The rice paper wrapping was already hard so I couldn't even eat the outer wrapper, I just ate the inside part of it and I didn't have the time to go back and ask for it to be remade. So I don't go here as often as I used to. I will still go every once in a while."}
{"text":"When you think of Vietnamese food you think of french baking, right?! Well, after a visit to Lee's I will from now on. I have been to Lee's a few times and no matter what time of day the croissants are always flakey, soft, and delicious and the baguettes are warm and crusty. They even have a ham/cheese croissant that hits the spot perfectly in the morning. I like to accompany mine with a Lee's coffee, which to be honest I dont really know what it is. Some kind of iced-sweet-latte-goodness. If you're in the mood for a larger breakfast they offer four different types of egg/meat/croissant sandwiches too. 

If you happen to stop in during lunch there are over 20 different sandwiches to choose from. Some are basic turkey and ham. The others have more of a...uh...Vietnamese flare to them. All are about $6 and come on your choice of a baguette or croissant (my four star rating is mostly due to the fact that the meat is a little stingy). After lunch you can crave that sweet tooth with some ice cream or a smoothy. 

One thing you will notice about Lee's is its cleanliness! Always immaculate. I dont know how they manage it but it has to be the easiest stop on the health inspectors route. Pop in late in the day if you want some cheap day old bread, which is still pretty great.

*One more thing- Be sure to bring cash!! Double check your wallet because this is a no card establishment."}
{"text":"Best time to eat at Lee's is when the HOT BAGUETTES NOW is on! Usually, we find the bread to be tough  but this time the bread was what I believed the original Lee's used to be. While waiting for your number to be called, try the shrimp and pork egg rolls. They're a decent snack for $3.99."}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to try out Lee's sandwiches today! It was really good, we ordered the combo sandwich, grilled pork sandwich, spring rolls, and egg rolls.  The French baguette was excellent- warm and crusty.  The hubby and I agreed that it would have been better if there were more meat, but you can't beat it for under $4.  We would probably skip the spring rolls next time, but the egg rolls were good.  Remember to bring cash!!"}
{"text":"www.SandwichOdyssey.blogspot.com

This is my first post of the \"Sandwich Odyssey\" in which Dave and I have decided to undertake.  I am filled with the anxiousness a child would have on Christmas Eve.  It really is an extended Christmas for an adult...well, an adult who really enjoys eating.  Anyways, let's begin.

The first sandwich Dave and I decided to tackle was Lee's Sandwiches' BBQ Pork Sandwich.  Lee's is located just off the 101 in Chandler.  Lee's is not exactly in my neck of the woods but this is unimportant.  I will travel great lengths to get some good grub.  The restaurant itself was quite a bit larger than I had envisioned.  This particular version of Lee's (Lee's Sandwiches is a chain) was located in a fairly nondescript strip mall.  This, of course, is no surprise to Phoenix residents.  The valley is practically one big strip mall!  After lunch Dave and I noticed that this is an area with a prevalent asian influence.  For one, there was an Asian art academy across the street.  Second, I noticed a significant asian clientele at the gas station and CVS across the street.  I'm sure the Lee's Sandwich Corporate folks did their demographic homework.

The experience reminded me of what would be seen if one were to actually travel to, say, Vietnam or China.  The colors, layout, and style all seemed to be a good representation of a fast food restaurant in some of the Asian cities.  Ok, I just realized I've been discussing everything but what I was there for, the BBQ Pork Sandwich.

I ordered the featured BBQ Pork Sandwich and because the prices were so reasonable ($2.35 for a 10\" baguette sandwich) I decided to order something a little unique.  I went out on a limb and ordered the Special Combination or Head Cheese Sandwich.  The two sandwiches and a 16 ounce iced tea came to a whopping $7 and change.  Not bad, not bad at all!

I'm not going to go into detail about the Head Cheese Sandwich.  All I will say is that it was not a very good take on head cheese.  It was too chewy and lacked the rich flavor I enjoy from head cheese.  The BBQ Pork, on the other hand, was enjoyable.  Not great but enjoyable.  This is the third or fourth sandwich I've tried that is in this style (i.e. The Tea Light Cafe).  I'm sure it's a personal preference or maybe I'm just a product of my American society but this sandwich was dry and lacks any kind of \"punch.\"  All of these Vietnamese/Chinese sandwiches are like that.  They keep getting positive reviews from the professionals but I'm not that impressed.  Personally, I need the wet component.  The sandwich doesn't have to have a sauce per se but, with all that bread, I need something to balance dry versus wet.  

Now don't get me wrong, the pork was good.  It was moist, it had a nice deep red color, and it had very good flavor.  The bread (which is baked in house every day) met my expectations but doesn't exactly warrant a baking award.  All in all, it was ok; however, when you consider the price it is an above average value.  If you were asking me, I'd tell you not to go out of your way to try Lee's Sandwiches but if you're in the area and on a fast-food budget, check 'em out.

{"text":"We had to stop by this place before leaving Vegas.  My husband loves their iced coffee (ca phe sua da) and their sandwiches! I ordered the steam pork with pâté baguette sandwich, it was so good (given that we actually don't have a Lee's Sandwiches in Sacramento anymore).  We did have to wait a bit for our order, so do prepare for that."}
{"text":"One word, #11. That's it. A couple of friends and I stopped by Lee's for lunch. Of course, the cashless me only had credit cards and they only took cash. I ordered the #11 special combination and the spring rolls. But they were out of spring rolls. Really? Uhm, you can make that easily!

I got my sandwich, the bread was deliciously warm. If you wait for the bread to cool down, it gets hard and you'll have a hard time eating it. 

So bottom line, go when hungry and during brunch when lines are shorter."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Workers look like they don't want to be there. I got their Vietnamese coffee. Pricing is not bad ($4.75 for a large) but the ice to coffee ratio is definitely a con for me. I got 75% ice and barely any coffee which is disappointing for the price I'm paying. On the bright side, their Vietnamese coffee is pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I had their Asian #5 sandwich - Vietnamese pulled pork sandwich.  The bread was fresh, light, crispy outside, and soft inside.  It was a tasty, fresh, and light sandwich.  Also, I had their pork & shrimp spring rolls.  It was so delicious and fresh.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Came here for a pick me up drink and enjoyed their mango boba.

This location is easy to get to and has reasonable prices.

I will come here again for sure."}
{"text":"I only come here for their smoothies with bobas. Sometimes long wait to get my two drinks. I have not tried any of their sandwiches yet. Someday..."}
{"text":"I only come here for the smoothies and milk teas, yum!! I have not tried any of their sandwiches. They're not pricy thats why I come here alot."}
{"text":"Well this was a welcome surprise! I've become accustomed to this building rotating out Chinese food restaurants, but when I saw \"Sandwiches\" I was intrigued. It wasn't hard to give it a try either, since they have drive through. 

My first trip I tried the #71 a pork roll and fried egg sandwich. Really tasty. Noticed right away everything tasted fresh, including the bread which had that fresh baked taste. 

The next day I found myself thinking about their other sandwiches so I went back for lunch. I tried the grilled pork. I really like the vermicelli noodle bowls with pork and eggroll at Vietnamese restaurants, this was basically that pork on a sandwich and my tastebuds were very happy. 

Definitely recommend this place as something quick , reasonably priced, and much different from any other drive through in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always my go-to spot for vietnamese sandwhiches. Love the baguettes, makes the sandwhich taste so much better! Never disappointed! 

Best addition is the passion tea Italian soda. All the yumminess inside is great!!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw a Lees near us in Peoria. Love love their sandwhiches! Normally.

Just a thought at 1:30pm (yes maybe end tail of lunch) who runs out of bread, completely!!!! So we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a sandwhich. Maybe we shouldn't have waited but I was craving it.

Service wasn't bad. They did forget a couple of our drinks which apparently had been made buy were just sitting there for the whole 30 min. Needless to say our smoothie with whip cream looked more like a smoothie with a white cream on top since the whip cream all melted.

I'm sure I'll be back since there is no other lees around but I'll just go in with lower expectations"}
{"text":"Its really sad to see a very, very good deli open to a new location only for it TOTALLY BOMB! The sanwiches were Okay, but MY GOD were the pork buns bad. Dont get me wrong, i love the one in China town but at the new location, wouldnt dare eat there again. The whole place is filled with bad service and cooks who very crapely cook food. Its really a shame to see such a good deli destroy it's self."}
{"text":"The Skinny: ordered the BBQ pork banh mi and it was so salty! The bread was also not as good as other places (2) service: the cashier was super friendly and service was fast at 1:30 am, (4) value: if you are craving banh mi late at night,  I guess it is okay.  But otherwise there are way better joints in town that do a way better job for less (2)

I had just got off work and was looking to nosh. On the way home,  I made a pit stop at Lee's to grab a bite. Was interested in all the various sandwiches they had including non-Asian ones. 

I ordered their bbq pork banh mi #6 off the menu. Purchase was cash only and cost $4.86.  Service was fast,  friendly and helpful. I was kind of wondering why she offered soy sauce and hot sauce with my order. More on that later. 

I unwrapped the sammy and it looked pretty legit. That is until I bit in. 

The bread is pretty hard. As in scrape-up-the-roof-of- your-mouth hard. The middle part of the bread is kind of too dense and chewy. 

Filling wise,  the meat is kind of skimpy and bland for bbq pork. Which is probably why they added soy sauce and rendered a very salty sammy. First time I have ever seen soy sauce in a banh mi. Kind of bad upon bad. 

They were kinda light on the undermarinated veggies too.  Odd thing was the presence of onions on the banh mi. Never seen a banh mi with onions in it and I've had my fair share. Not a fan of the onions and now that I know will ask them to leave that out too. That along with the soy sauce. 

Overall,  if you're craving some late night/really early morning banh mi,  this joint is okay.  But with all the other better joints around?  I'd give this joint a pass (2 stars)."}
{"text":"Your fairly typical Vietnamese sandwich can now be found in Chinatown of Las Vegas. Lee's is a chain that you can find in a lot of major cities including LA and SF. However, the prices that I am used to in California are definitely not found here. I would say they are about $1 more expensive than usual being right under $4 for a sandwich, but still whenever I am craving a pretty good Vietnamese sandwich (be it a chicken, pork or special), I can come to Lee's to get one....at any of the time day since they are open 24/7. You can even satisfy your slot machine craving in the front or get some frozen yogurt too."}
{"text":"I adore Lee's Sandwiches for their convenience but it's not consistent between different locations.  
This location is great because it's relatively close to the strip and it is open 24 hours.  However, the sandwiches, drinks and pastries are much better at the Lee's in California.
Overall, Lee's Sandwiches is just overpriced Banh Mi's. 

reminder: there's a 25 cents additional charge per item after hours"}
{"text":"Stopped by and picked up sandwiches for my son and I. I got the almond tuna on a croissant, and since there is no children's menu got him a ham and cheese on a croissant. 
The croissants are good, not light and flacks as one would expect, but a bit heavier like they use whole wheat Flour maybe. Both sandwiches were good, I liked that hey have a drive though. It wasn't busy when I went and had to wait maybe five minutes for the two sandwiches. 
I would come back to try their baguettes."}
{"text":"In Short: Yummy awesomeness!!! Delicious and cheap, can't go wrong with this place.

I'm somewhat of a sandwich nut, I've driven to beyond bread in Tucson just to have a sandwich, more than once.  This is my favorite place in phoenix, period!  I wish they had more of these around like in Cali but I don't mind the drive to chandler.  The place itself is pretty nice, well lit and adequately decorated, creating an easy going atmosphere.  They only take cash, which is sometimes very annoying, but that's the only thing bad about this place.  

the menu is pretty divers, many sandwich items are available.  Most of them are Vietnamese style, but there are some cross cuisine items as well.  Most authentic and my favorite is probably numbers 4 and 5, but you couldn't go wrong with trying a new sandwich every time you go there.  They have a bakery built in, so the bread is amazing, always fresh and crunchy.  If you just want to go pickup a baguette, you can.  All their sandwiches consist of a foot long baguette sliced down the middle, sub style.  Then filled with your meats, pickled radishes and carrots, and then topped off with a little cilantro and jalapenos.  If you like it less spicy just take the damn jalapenos out!  They also have amazing drinks, decent desserts, and pretty yummy appetizers.  I recommend you try their chicken wings, very crispy and delicious but a bit oily.  

The price is what makes this place amazing, pretty much all the items are between 2.50-4$.  The sandwiches are pretty filling as well, making it an unbeatable combo.  You guys should try it out, won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've only had a baguette once but never again, it almost made my gums bleed!

However, ever since they opened I've been a fan of their most delectable croissant sandwiches. Great prices and awesome drinks. Suckks they don't take card but still worth it."}
{"text":"The subs are worthy of a four (long way from a five I'm afraid) but the lychee smoothie deserves an 11.  My goodness that is one tasty drink.  I could drink them all day every day.  Go enjoy a sub and try not to cream in your pants when you taste the smoothie.  Seriously, they're that good."}
{"text":"The past 3 times I went here they haven't had any deli meats.  I've been going to this place since i was a kid and now that they are preventing myself and other customers from ordering from the entire menu is unacceptable.  Asking us to use cash is hard enough and now you're telling me that i can only order certain things from the menu?I will never come back to this place and I would never recommend this place to my friends.  This place lacks food and customer service!!! Mekong supermarket just opened a new sandwich shop.  I'm going to go there from now on."}
{"text":"Great banh mi sandwich under $4.  The best iced coffee.  Tv is on while you stop in and enjoy your lunch. Easy, quick, tasty and I always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"#17- you're welcome.  Service is great, place is hella clean, price is right- what more do you want?"}
{"text":"In the area, in the mood for a Bánh mì, need to try Lee's.  Clean as a whistle, efficient, easy to navigate.  #11, easy peesy, big enough to split (for a regular appetite)- I loved the bread, perfect balance, the ingredients were great.  Was the \"Open 24/7\" missed?  LOVE it!"}
{"text":"When you're craving munchies late at night, this place is opened! They have snacks galore!!! I usually come here for the iced coffee and the Baos."}
{"text":"Went hoping for an awesome Vietnamese sandwich. Totally disappointed. Grilled pork was not grilled. It was shoe leather. No maggi sauce, sandwich was served dry as a bone. Egg rolls were okay nothing special and the pork pate chaud was lackluster. 

I also purchased some butter cookies that were rancid. and I was disappointed because I bought them to take home and YUCK! On the good side, since I had to go that area anyway they took them back and returned my money. I wouldnt usually evn do that but I thought they needed to know the whole batch might have been past expiration date."}
{"text":"Lee's sandwiches is a great place to get Asian and American style sandwiches. My personal favorite is the # 6, an Asian style BBQ pork sandwich that comes with carrots, onions, jalapenos, and cilantro all on a fresh baguette. They also serve many different types of traditional sandwich options such as salami, roast beef, ham ect. Over all a great place to stop in for lunch just beware they only accept cash!"}
{"text":"my friend jose took me here 
he said I gonna take you to a place for the best  coffe in vegas better than starbucks.......
well  
I try the Vietnamese coffe was freaking sweet I also try a almond croissant was really good
the latino staff is nice & friendly
prices are decent"}
{"text":"Excellent banh mi sandwiches. The baguettes are amazing. Also tried the summer rolls but disappointed the filling was more lettuce and not rice noodles.  Very clean and good service.  Also has good selection of Asian grocery items."}
{"text":"I went to this place with high expectations. People talked about this place so highly, so of course I couldn't wait. The atmosphere is pretty cool and the place is huge, you're guaranteed a seat. You won't miss your order, unless you forget your number or loose your receipt, because they have a robot on speaker calling out your number throughout the whole place.

Well, I've always gotten a combination sandwich and I get mine at a local Asian market bakery down the street, so I was expecting something just as good. Well, for two combination sandwiches it took about 30 minutes for our order, kinda ridiculous. As soon as I picked up my order of my combination sandwiches all I noticed was small portions of everything. I didn't even taste vegetables or the spread they usually put on it. I guess it was an okay sandwich but I've had better. Also, I wasn't even half way done with my sandwich and the roof of my mouth was all scratched up from their bread. I thought maybe if I had some hoisin sauce or Sriacha it would help, first off they didn't know what hoisin was when I asked for it, second, they gave me a little cup of Sriacha good enough for two bites and they said they only could give me two. Great. I was not feeling this place at all. I guess I should go give it another try & try something else but for their prices, I could just stick with my Asian market's bakery."}
{"text":"Not cool... I was waiting for my order to be taken when the employee finally got off the phone she took the order of the lady that was clearly behind me. She had about a 75$ order!   Really!   Needless to say I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite. Ordered 3 sandwiches, 3 Vietnamese coffee, 5 egg rolls, 1 order of spring roll, and 2 pate chaud. The total came to over $50. I've had better sandwiches in Seattle. The coffee was way too strong."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for your order.  The sandwiches are too much (dry) bread with weird bits of meat.  That's ordering pork or chicken...I didn't even order the \"WEIRD\" meats.  Easily the worst banh mi in town.  The pate chaud are obnoxiously greasy.  Ask them to double or triple bag them on to go orders unless you are cool with grease leaking through the bag & onto your passenger car seat.  On second thought...don't even order them.

There is a girl that works the counter in the morning that needs to be fired.  One morning I ordered 2 chicken eggrolls & 3 shrimp.  After I order, she tells me if I order 5 eggrolls I get a discount.  I educated her in math & let her know that 2+3 = 5...ugh!  I also ordered a banh mi & she tried to correct the way I said banh mi.  I'm half Vietnamese & know how to say banh mi...double ugh.  I asked her for nuoc mam (fish sauce) & she looked at me with a blank stare...I had to tell her \"Fish Sauce.\"  So much for my plans on hiring her as a Vietnamese tutor...

Getting Sriracha sauce from her was harder than pulling teeth.  She looked down to where the to go plastic cups of it usually are & said they were out.  I had to ask her to get it from the kitchen, where I could see a bottle of it from behind the counter...triple ugh!  She has consistently sucked on other occasions as well.

Only come here at 4am if you are drunk, have plenty of time & don't care what you are eating.  Do not come here if you have time constraints such as heading to work...you will be late from doing the girl at the counters' job.

Hue Thai & Mr. Sandwich are better choices, granted they are not 24/7."}
{"text":"What a let down! I was looking forward to trying this place out when I first heard about it :( the first time I came here they were out of sandwiches.. how does a sandwich shop run out of sandwiches. The second time I came here it took 10-15 minutes to get the sandwich when it wasn't busy at all. I ordered the banh mi thit nuong.. unfortunately half the pork I had was undercooked. 

The large coffee I ordered was 90% ice.. 10% coffee

When I asked if they had any napkins.. they said they were out!! Really?!?


Might try again in several months when they have everything up to speed but was very disappointed"}
{"text":"Today was labor day. Very busy day and was faster then the day I wrote a review about, lol...I guess things happen. I know they do. I've worked in restaurants for much of my life but usually when things do, we would try to explain to the guest or even give something so that the bad impression isn't lasting. I guess I shouldn't expect that though. This place is usually good but was just really bummed the day I wrote the other review."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a light Wednesday afternoon after work, hoping to get some light refreshment and some food. Been waiting in line for a good 10min then 20min PLUS to get the food. As I'm yelping right now, my order has yet to be called. How can people who ordered after us finish their meal and leave already? Not sure what is taking so long to make 2 drinks and 2 baguette...sorry but I wouldn't return here even if it was using the drive through."}
{"text":"Okay first thing to know: CASH ONLY. There is a ATM there but just come prepared. Second, come hungry and with an open mind. If you're avoiding carbs...stay away. But if you enjoy Asian or French food, proceed. Freshly baked croissants, baguettes, There are so many sandwiches choices. My favorite is the #1 special and #12 Vegetarian and a Lee's iced coffee. But everything is good. Breakfast croissant sandwich is amazing. There are fun treats too like egg custard, real colored macaroons, red bean balls, pork buns, etc. Prepare to sit to people watch too."}
{"text":"I would give it zero star if I could because of food safety reason. My husband and I went here for brunch. He ordered a grilled pork banh mi stuffed with some suspiciously bright-colored meat, pickled veggies, and raw cilantro. I got a breakfast sandwich with cooked eggs, ham, and cheese on croissant. Later that day, my husband started to feel sick - lack of appetite, light headed, and slight diarrhea. The diarrhea was getting much worse that night and the symptoms lasted for 2 days after we put him on anti-diarrhea medicines. We believe it was due to food poisoning from the banh mi since we ate otherwise the same food that day. We had banh mi regularly in other places and we never had any issue. This place charged less for a reason. I feel grossly sick when I think about the who-knows-what meat like stuff and RAW veggies. Beware of the food safety issues here!"}
{"text":"Their bread is so amazing! Definitel get the number 11 combo. With extra pate. Prices are reasonable and their ice coffee is great! I also love the little donuts the  make fresh. Everytime I come home from California/Vegas my kids are expecting these sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Lee's is one of my favorite \"Chandler Gems\" and a great place to eat when nothing else sounds good. I love it so much I call it \"Mr. Lee's\" because a place this good deserves my respect. 

My usual sandwich is the Asian Vegetable which consists of carrots, daikon radish (I think?), vermicelli (like the fried rice noodles that top a Chinese Chicken Salad), tofu (fried bits?), cilantro, and fresh jalapeno on a wonderful baguette. The flavors and textures are awesome and it's actually pretty light and healthy. 

If you are not as adventurous as I am, the Euro Sandwiches are AMAZING. You could serve a steaming pile of dog crap on one of their croissants and it would be delicious. Their muffins are really good too. 

My absolute favorite thing from Lee's also happens to be one of the top 10 best things I've ever put in my mouth. It is called pate choud and I could eat it all day every day. Pate choud consists of a small meatball (chicken or pork) surrounded by layers of the most delectable, buttery, flaky, crispy layers of pastry known to humankind. There are not words that can express the wondrousness of it all....so just try it. You can get a little two biter for 75 cents or a bigger one for $1.50."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the chicken sandwich with the Asian veggies, absolutely delicious. The baguettes are fresh baked, making it a heavenly bite! I highly suggest the wings, they are crispy with a perfect robust flavor and a spicy kick. Kick it off with an avocado smoothie and your set!"}
{"text":"Lee's is solid 4-star sandwich shop. It's the perfect place to stop for a bite during lunch but heck, why limit yourself to just one meal when they have all sorts of stuff here? I saw smoothies, appetizers, and even a BAKERY. Of course we picked up two baguettes to go, how can you resist delicious, freshly baked bread?

My hubby and I LOVED the bread our sandwiches came in as well, just take out look at how fluffy and fresh it looks in my Veggie with Avocado sandwich:

While we were there enjoying our tasty sandwiches on a Sunday afternoon there was no break in customers coming in and out. It seems we aren't the only ones who truly appreciate a simple yet awesome sandwich on the weekend.

FYI:
-Their ordering system is set up so you can't miss your number being called.
-Cash only
-No free refills :(

Lee's is THE SPOT for a darn good sandwich. Don't hesitate. Just go. :)"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with the Vietnamese sandwiches here at Lee's. Maybe its because the last time had one felt like they did things the right way. My first impression when I walked in was is this even a Vietnamese establishment. Not that one too judges book by its cover. Sure they had small section selling Vietnamese products from candies, dry goods products, baked goods, and beverages. It felt more like american chain sub or sandwich shop. 

I had the grilled pork sandwich or thit nuong. The same one last time had one but this was in Sacramento area. Not as though not close because my grilled pork sandwich had all the condiments that traditional. The spring of cilantro, sliced jalapeno, the carrots and believe daikon, and if there was anything they did hit on point was the bread. The bread was perfect hot, fresh, crispy outside, and great bread. They place they feel short for me. The grilled pork lacked flavor for me, portion size could have been bigger, the sauce or spread inside not fan of, and when combine everything together nothing Wow or get excited about. My dad who visiting order the combination sandwich. Not sure the types of meat in it but not fan more so then grilled pork sandwich. 

Really if looking too get Vietnamese sandwich not the pace too go. I know I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Woohoo there's a Lee's Sandwiches in the SW! 

So I've never been to a Lee's Sandwiches until this location opened up but I've heard some good and bad things about them. They have a large selection of sandwiches which range from their Asian inspired sandwiches to their Euro sandwiches which includes croissants and sandwiches made from your not so Asian ingredients like ham and cheese, BLT, and salami. They are a chain restaurant with I don't even know how many locations along the West Coast but their sandwiches do kind of  feel like a chain restaurant.

I've only had a couple of their sandwiches, the grilled pork and the BBQ pork. Give it time I'll probably try more. I would've enjoyed them more if the bread wasn't too hard and if there was more fillings in between the bread. But then they were almost a foot long and only about $4 which isn't bad. Both sandwiches pretty much tasted the same. I liked it but not to much. Didn't see any kind of condiments like sriracha or soy sauce to add flavor. Could I suggest maybe offering some type of hot soup to dip the sandwiches in or did I just miss it on the menu? But that would make it a lot better for me at least. There's a lot better choices for Asian sandwiches if your willing to drive.

I liked all the Asian snacks, steamed buns, and drinks they were offering. I wanna say I saw some wasabi flavored shrimp chips. Let me get back to the drinks they have teas, juices, coffees, hot/cold drinks, and more.  I could go back just for these.

Right now I think I'm gonna have to give them a 3.5 star rating mostly because they're probably the only business I know of in the area doing what they do which is offering Asian tasting sandwiches and steam bun goods which saves me from driving towards Chinatown.

I'd probably stop by more than I want to. I think they have free WiFi."}
{"text":"So convenient that this location is open 24 hours.

I usually get the Iced Blended Mocha with Boba. And always make sure to get a fresh baguette for the ride home. Its so soft and warm. Best French baguette you can find. and they bake it fresh every 30 mins."}
{"text":"Good selection of sandwiches for a great price. The bread was very fresh and scrumptious. They also have the best pepperoncini!

The place was huge and clean.

I will be going back for more for sure."}
{"text":"The bread is really hard and the sandwiches are really dry. The Vietnamese desserts in the fridges are not good, very generic nothing special. This place is good because it's open 24 hours but other than that it's not a good place to go to not a lot of selection for food besides sandwiches. Don't come here expecting is going to be another Lee sandwich from San Jose or LA because it's not. Save your money."}
{"text":"SLOW service!!! I got a coffee and sandwich yesterday. They made my coffee and it sat up on the tray. It sat for a good 15 min till my sandwich was made. You would think they have an assembly line technique down but nope. There were like 5 girls working back there all Lolly gagging and they saw the line of people just standing there waiting and getting irritated. I knew I wasn't the only one as the other customers were talking to me about how long it was taking. Cashier was nice but didn't want fault for anything kept saying things that at the beginning was funny and then got irritating. Coffee was a. It watered down. They should make it according to the time the rest of your order is made. Sandwich was decent. Would have given more stars if I didn't have to spend so much time just waiting."}
{"text":"The only thing they're good at is coffee.  Their sandwiches have very little meat that you hardly taste it.  Each bite you taste mostly the bread and the pickled vegetable.  I ordered pork roll (chia lua) and it had one thin slice of the pork roll and no pate."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 4 stars. The only thing I need to remember is to ask for double meat and double veggies next time. The sandwhiches were cheap and tasty, they just needed more filling. The employees were nice also."}
{"text":"I stopped by cause I was in the area and I'm familiar with other locations of this chain. I ordered a pork and egg bun bao, the \"dac biet\" sandwich, and a black milk tea. Service was good. Location wasn't very busy, but that could've just been the time of day. Everything tasted good. The bun bao was a little dry, but I didn't mind so much since I don't usually eat the all of the bun anyway. The sandwich was very filling. Their bread is always cut longer than your normal banh mi sandwiches that you get at the Vietnamese delis. I saved half for the next day. Tasted just fine microwaved. Usually I'll toast it in the oven so the bread is crispy on the outside, but I didn't have access to one at the hotel. Overall, a good choice if you're looking for Asian sandwiches made with French bread."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches here, especially their grilled pork banh mi. The pork has a good flavor and goes well with the crunch of the daikon and jalapenos they stick in with it. I just wish they would put more meat in their sandwiches so I'm not hungry again in 1-2 hours after eating here. Would recommend them as a good snack spot if you're in the Chinatown area because the food isn't filling enough for a full meal. But for $4.25 a sandwich, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"great place always open! best eggrolls ever. would give 5 stars but they are sometimes out of yogurt when I go."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Lee's since they opened but I must admit I am getting disappointed the more I go there. Today topped it off. I bought 7 sandwiches. One of which was an Op la (egg) banh mi (sandwich), my eggs were BURNT. I mean take pride in your job and at least re do the eggs. Word of mouth is the best form of marketing. I am absolutely disappointed."}
{"text":"Ever since I was introduced to Lee's Ice Coffee last summer in Los Angeles I've been obsessed!  I like it because it's bitter and sweet at the same time. 
I've only had their sandwiches a couple of times bit enjoyed it every time. I personally don't see all the hype in vietnamese sandwiches. I admit that they're good. But it's not something I find myself craving to have. The only time I ever get it is when I'm having their coffee."}
{"text":"sometimes i crave durian and my husband will not let me even BREATHE in his atmosphere if i've had it, let alone buy one from leelee's across the street. so, i LOVE when lee's has the ice cream and, if they don't, i'll get the shake.

i get all the strange fruit shakes.

after all, i am what nina simone would call a strange fruit. ;)"}
{"text":"Excuse me...but these sandwiches are AWESOME!! You get a delicious 10\" sandwich for like $2.50!  How can you beat that? The baguettes are soo crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, which is awesome since they make it there.  The only reason that I give it one less star, is because they only take cash."}
{"text":"This is not one of the better Lee's. They really do skip out on the toppings and the meat. Also no cured pork although it's on the menu. 

I had the special combination and pork roll. They were not like ones I've gotten from Lee's before. They were sparse. I had to eat somewhere else after. 

At least it looks nice inside and is inexpensive. I'm sorry to say I won't be coming back to this location. There are many good restaurants in this plaza to go to instead."}
{"text":"A perfect place for lunch or a quick snack! 

This is probably the best viet sandwich shop in the Phoenix metro area (let me know if you think there is a better place).  The prices are right, the sandwiches are freshly made and drinks are flavorful.   My favorites are the BBQ pork and grill pork sandwiches.   And I ALWYAS get double/ extra meat ^___^    My favorite drink is their banana smoothie!  It's refreshing and thirst crunching!  

The location is big and is great for group/ hang out.  This is a perfect place to grab a quick bite after shopping at Lee Lee's!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great bread bakery, and great prices. Now that I live back in Chicago I miss this place a lot I've never had a bad sandwich from this place. I would always pick up a sandwich, some bread and croissants for the house, they're always fresh and the place is open 24 hours, how can you beat that?! This place deserves 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I appreciate this restaurant  for open 24 hours.
because sometimes past late night in Vegas  I just want a light sandwich and a little bit of Vietnamese desert.
it's great!"}
{"text":"This is a great Vietnamese franchise. I always love eating their banh mi dac biet. Banh mi is one of my favorite foods."}
{"text":"Interesting place and service was good, but their sandwiches are average at best. Same with the bread."}
{"text":"Love the Asian sandwiches and fresh deserts made to order!! Try to make it here everytime I'm in town"}
{"text":"Freshly baked French baguettes and pastries, strong Vietnamese iced coffee, and delicious sandwiches here. You can't really go wrong here, but do bring cash; they don't take credit or debit cards here (though there is an ATM inside). The prices are reasonable and the place is kept clean. It's always a pleasure to come here."}
{"text":"I'm not a bahn mi fan like my husband is, but after countless times of coming here and watching him eat a sandwhich, I finally tried a BLT on a croissant and let me tell you... I am now obsessed.  They made the croissant fresh and it made the sandwhich so delicious.  Even if you don't like the viet sandwhiches, try a regular sandwhich on a croissant, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Wow, really?  Not at all what I was expecting, especially with all the hype that surrounded this particular location.

I live in the Bay Area, CA where there are plenty of Lee's Sandwiches. I've only been to one, in San Jose, but the variety of food they offered was mind-blowing.  So when my parents and I were visiting my sister in Vegas and she told us about this massive Lee's that just opened and had 500 employees (according to local news), and after seeing all their billboards, I was expecting something fantastic.

Well, not only did it not live up to the hype, it didn't even live up to what I would expect a Vietnamese sandwich shop to be.  Yes, the place is ginormous, but that's primarily the sitting area.  Set up bright and plentiful like a McD's, I can see people coming here during the wee Vegas hours. 

The actual menu though is puny.  Some basic Vietnamese sandwiches (I've seen tiny locally owned shops offer a better variety) but mostly American sandwiches.  Huh?  Aside from the sandwiches, there are various sides, desserts, and snacks offered.  It seemed to me the place didn't really need to be as big as it was considering their tiny menu.

Sandwiches are pricier than Dakao, just a few blocks away and way way subpar.  I grew up on Vietnamese sandwiches and eat them regularly and these were probably the worst I've ever had. Edible, yes. But a far far cry from an authentic Vietnamese sandwich.   And the wait was pretty long too.  I tried their siu mai (pork meatball) and their grilled pork.  Their grilled pork tasted very little like Vietnamese grilled pork but was ok.  Not great, just ok.  Their siu mai though was very lacking in flavor.  I've never not finished a Vietnamese sandwich before but I couldn't find it in me to finish the siu mai.  Also, the sandwich itself was smaller than I expected.  Apparently, Vegas Vietnamese sandwiches ARE smaller than the ones in the Bay Area but even compared to Dakao, the Lee's sandwiches were small.

We had originally planned to eat lunch there and then order more sandwiches to go to eat later that day.  But after our lunch there, we instead drove to Dakao and bought some sandwiches there, which are much better, not to mention cheaper, not to mention they are a locally-owned small business run by a cute husband & wife team. 

At least the girl who took our order spoke Vietnamese.  But she wasn't very friendly (which actually is pretty authentic I guess).  The Latino guy who was making the pastries was a lot more friendly.  Although they serve some Vietnamese food, I don't know that I would actually classify this Lee's Sandwich as a Vietnamese food place.  I honestly can't see this place surviving, but then again, I don't live in Vegas.

The reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is that my sister said their pate is the bomb. She said it is their only redeeming quality.  Unfortunately, since we ended up not ordering more sandwiches, I wasn't able to try it myself so have to take her word for it."}
{"text":"Oh man, its me. I'm going to be the jerk that gives Lee's super famous sandwich shop 3 stars. I feel like I've desecrated on a Phoenix staple... even though its a giant fast food chain place in Asia.

The 5 star component at Lee's is definitely their Vietnamese coffee. Its strong, sweet and a great way to kick your OCD into high gear for just $2.50. I would like to say that it energized my morning, but really it game me an adrenaline shot so powerful that I couldn't fully do anything that required even an ounce of concentration. I may have had a minor twitch later, but the taste of that coffee made it all worth it.

Now I did my homework and I did exactly what yelp suggested: I got the grilled pork sandwich with extra meat. Maybe that was my mistake, listening to Yelp (You're not the boss of me!). The sandwich definitely had tons of meat, but the quality of the pork was very iffy. I almost don't want to know what part of the pig I was eating, it felt that questionable. The jalapenos were great but I couldn't taste much of the pickled veggies- probably my fault for getting the extra pork. There was no crunch, no sourness in the picking, no real Bahn Mi flavors. it was a delicious baguette with mystery meat. The size and pricing were spectacular, I just wasn't sold on the flavor.

I still have hope for a place with such low prices, and hefty Yelp support. Maybe next time I will trust my senses and get it.. MY WAY.

Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Best Boba Smoothie I've ever had! 

This place was amazing... for smoothies. I'll level with you here.... I didn't try ANY of the food. I only had 5 bucks on me at the time. 

They let a group of us hold a super smash bros tournament there though in a side room for a pretty decent price. That plus the ridiculously awesome boba smoothie made it a pretty great experience for me. Looking forward to the next tournament just so I can get more of those smoothies.


To the complaint below that it's ridiculous to put a 25 cent surcharge on all items...... Consider opening a restaurant for 24 hours. Consider the cost of being open during hours that business is far from \"booming\". You might understand needing to charge just a little more merely to stay open 24 hours a little easier. Not every cost increase in the world is made out of greed."}
{"text":"Nice and big Lee sandwich compare to other Lee's.
Go hear for Lee's ice coffee. Better than starbucks."}
{"text":"When you think of Chinatown in Las Vegas, one doesn't usually equate it with extremely fresh baguettes. But that's what you will find at Lee's Sandwiches on Spring Mountain Rd. I have enjoyed my recent visits and here's why. Spoiler alert, because Hello Kitty. No, but seriously, there are a lot of fun characters that greet you on the way in.

It wasn't my first choice to try Lee's Sandwiches when so many other options are available a few doors away. But what I discovered, mostly good, was an always open, quick service restaurant with a modern Asian flare.

After ogling the freshly baked bread through their peek-a-boo oven window, ordering food was top of mind. I was hungry like a ravenous wolf roaming the frozen tundra.

Ordering was a little sketchy, but I was thankful my purchase was fulfilled perfectly. I bought two BBQ oversized pork buns, a #1 BBQ somewhat spicy pork sandwich meal on a small baguette and a Dr Pepper no ice. It also came with a few egg rolls.

Here's the thing with egg rolls. They could be nuclear hot when coming out of their warming box, but like shoestring fries, they go cold faster than an aluminum engine block, in the Midwest, during a Polar Vortex.

A small tip from me to you, eat the egg rolls first. Then the pork buns and finally the sandwich. This latest adventure to Lee's had me trying a smidgen of mayonnaise on the sandwich. It may be shocking to some that I added mayonnaise, but it made the sandwich creamy, spicy and overall better tasting. Otherwise the sandwich is drier than your mouth after waking around in the desert for 20 minutes.

I'd order this combo and sandwich every time I visit Lee's, it's that good. The BBQ pork buns are a few dollars each, but totally with it. The pork has a nice pink color with a hint of sweetness, exactly how I like it.

But what's not to like at Lee's? There is unfortunately a few things that I must mention. The first is a minimum purchase when using a credit card. If you order food past a certain time of day, each item will cost .25 cents more. If you are trying to feed a family, those quarters add up fast. Then there's the drink, ice and refill situation. Order a drink with no ice and the cup isn't filed to the top, just where the beverage would have been if it included ice. A refill fee of .50 cents is next.

Charging for refills is kinda baffling, like really? I can get a $1 large drink with free refills all day. But maybe they are trying to offset their free WiFi and TV? Probably not, but I can't imagine what their electric, gas and water bills are each month. All of that aside, I can't wait to go back to Lee's Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ordered the #1 combo and fresh spring rolls. The sandwich wasn't that good, I got sick of it after eating the first half. There's some type of bright red meat in the sandwich that I didn't like,  It was kinda gross so I removed it. I think the sandwich tasted better. The fresh spring rolls was ok, but it wasn't the best. You would have to go to lemon grass cafe for that one."}
{"text":"I've never had banh mi that I thought would break my teeth while eating it.  Not to mention this particular lee's was very frugal of the meat toppings."}
{"text":"We are big bahn mi fans and decided to give Lee
's a second chance after a bad experience a few years ago with questionable meat.  I ordered a \"grilled chicken\" and a \"grilled pork\" sandwich. The \"grilled\" chicken looked more microwaved or boiled and was very bland. The \"grilled\" pork also looked more microwaved then grilled and was mostly gristle and fat. Both meats were covered in congealed fat and looked like they never had touched a grill and may have been cooked a few days ago. Needless to say that almost all of both sandwiches went in the trash. The only reason they get two stars instead of one is because the bread was actually good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally stopped in for the pulled pork sandwiche. It was pretty good. The bread was very tasty and I loved the slight sweetness of the meat. I really wanted and expected some Srirachi sauce though. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once but the sandwich was very good. Their menu you could be easier to understand and they have so much it's hard to make a decision. Pricing was average, food was good, store was clean I will eat here again it just seems I never think of this place at lunch time."}
{"text":"food is decent but definitely not the best sandwich I've had. The iced coffee is super atrong and creamy."}
{"text":"I really love this place! We had the #5 pork and #12 veggie Asian sandwiches. The bread is the star here. It reminds me of the awesome French bread that I get in New Orleans. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The pickled veggies are nice. Onions, carrots, jalapenos that taste slightly sweet. These are huge, Jimmy Johns size sandwiches that only cost about $3. At first, I thought it would be too much, but it is so light! The smoothies are great also."}
{"text":"I have got to say, Lee's Sandwiches is my favorite place to go for a Bahn Mi-- cheap, nice size, and delicious. As far as the place, it is spacious, well lit, and clean considering it is open 24 hours. For those unfamiliar with a Vietnamese sandwich, you kind of have to know what to expect and/or go by recommendation as to what to order. My favorite would have to be the grilled pork banh mi. Many friends of mine like the Special Combination because it contains a variety of meats, but I'm not too fond of the paté inside. Their wide selection of beverages is perfect to quench anyone's thirst, I personally love their Italian sodas. While I've never had their frozen yogurt, it adds another thing they have available.

Also, BRING CASH if you don't plan on spending the $15.00 charge limit."}
{"text":"I love Lee's sandwiches! I always get the #5 with extra meat. It is such a refreshing change with the pickeled carrots, daikon, cilantro and jalapeño from just the many boring sandwich shops out there. Washing it down with a Thai tea is always nice too. Have been going to this place for years and I will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"I don't care if this place is known as the \"McDonalds\" of the Vietnamese sandwich world.  So long as they can serve me an awesome sandwich under $3, then they're okay in my book.  So quit crying about \"ow the hard bread cuts the roof of my mouth.\"  If you want a wuss sandwich, then go down the street to Subway."}
{"text":"I have been going to Lee's sandwiches for years now- since my days in the Bay Area. I actually tried something other than the Vietnamese BBQ pork sandwich this time around. I went with the salami and provolone sandwich on their croissant roll. Fantastic! It was piled high with meat, cheese, lettuce and tomato. The sandwich was so filling, I couldn't finish the tasty french horn dessert I bought (puffed pastry with vanilla custard). I love this place, and can't understand the mediocre reviews at this location. The food is good-the prices are better! Next time I will try that green coconut waffle that I keep hearing so much about."}
{"text":"Lee's is originally from my hometown San Jose, Ca. 

This spot is open 24/7 & is nearby the strip. Great spot for a cheap meal and bakery goods. I'll eat pretty much any banh mi (#5  & #6 are the most popular) or croissant sandwich. 
Their Vietnamese coffee is strong.

CASH ONLY or 10$ minimum debit purchase"}
{"text":"If you like Vietnamese food. This is the place for you. The sandwiches are amazing. Definitely come here and try the food. I truly love this place."}
{"text":"definitely a great deal and good sandwiches.  Only problem for me would be that the sandwich would be a lot better if they toasted the bread and served the sandwiches with cucumber like all other traditional vietnamese sandwiches.  Other than that, Lee's is a great place to go during the late hours."}
{"text":"When it comes to Lee's Sandwiches, I'll guess the answer is I'll have to come back in a few months to see if they're doing anything differently.  

Unlike a few other Yelpers who have had a Lee's Sandwich experience before, I've never been to this chain and really wanted to go as soon as they opened.  I really like banh mi and wanted to see if this place stacked up to other local establishments.  Unfortunately the service was super slow (perhaps due to being relatively new) and the sandwiches were not up to par.  I found them to be REALLY skimpy on the toppings as there were quite a few bites of my charbroiled pork sandwich that consisted of just bread and pickled carrots. I brought a bunch of friends with me to try it out and their sandwiches were equally...\"empty\".  I hope they understand that my desire to go to Lee's was to try them for the first time and not to show them a great place to eat.

As with some other places to eat here in Vegas, Lee's seems to be one of those places that is good just because it's open.  The quality is not there, we experienced really slow service and the sandwiches are skimpy.  I like the baguettes but there are better if I'm willing to drive to them. 

Overall, not the best, but something to eat if you need to soak up some alcohol after a night of going out.  As I'm a cab driver, I'll probably never go there for that reason so I guess I'll go back in about 6 months to see if they've gotten any better. 

Before I forget, it seems that Lee's has an abundance of ice as their drinks (coffee, iced tea or soft drinks) are mostly ice.  Make sure you don't get thirsty here as their drinks are mostly comprised of ice and you could end up spending a fortune to quench your thirst!

Maybe that will make the sandwiches seem like a better deal?"}
{"text":"Talk about bang for your buck, do the asian sandwiches as this is what separates this spot from any other sandwich shop. The bread is on point, and the flavors work, for something different, stop being such a sissy lala and try it"}
{"text":"We have been to many Lee's Sandwiches and this one was just as good.  The prices are so cheap.... although they do not put a lot of protein in their sandwiches.  But what stands out for me is the fresh baguettes they make ALL THE TIME for $1.25!!!!!!  I should always stop by and get my fresh baguettes there for that price!"}
{"text":"Another quick dissapointment among a overrated franchise that has lost it's steam over the course of a few years. When Lee's sandwiches first opened it's doors in California it was among the best places to go to for Banh Mi, Iced Coffee, and even their deserts. Unfortunately as they expanded their stores their quality slowly diminished. Let's hope that Las Vegas is the last place they go to.

I had the opportunity to go to their grand opening celebration with a couple of other fellow yelpers, but for the benefit of the doubt, I wanted to hold off on writing a review on them since it wouldn't have been fair. They were super busy that day, so I wanted to wait a bit and come back another time since I didn't get to check everything out.

Went there last night and it was a major dissapointment. The Banh Mi still sucked, bearly any meat or paste, if you're gonna give that little then charge less. It's Lees Sandwiches, not freaking Louis Vuitton or Chanel. So please don't charge more just because of the name. And if you're gonna charge more, at least make it taste super delicious so it's worth the price, but it's not. The bread I admit is good, but that's only because it is baked in house fresh everyday, so there is no excuse to mess up on that. Iced coffee, hella expensive for the amount they give you. I piss more after being dehydrated for 8 hours.

Overall the store is very clean and obviously new, very flashy and modern. They have free wifi, YAY! But I wouldn't use it anyway.

Customer service, oh lord......I asked one of the workers last night if they still only accepted cash, and she pretty much answered me like I was stupid retarded. She then right in front of me turned over to her co-worker and whispered something to him about me asking her such a stupid question, and that there is a sign right there that says \"cash only\", and he just shook his head. First of all you dumb
b!tch, if you're gonna talk sh!t right in front of a customer, then you might as well say it out loud and not try to cover your mouth with a freaking receipt. Or if you were smart at least wait till I'm gone and then say something. Fortunately I was in a good mood last night so I didn't say anything to her. So if you're reading this, YES, I heard you, you little twat. So let's rewind the retarded and don't get all pissy about me not seeing your stupid little sign. Out of all the shit and signs they have by the register how the hell am I suppose to see that little \"Cash only\" sign. That's like being in a night club and trying to find a midget.

So.............this junk get's one star, make your food better, charge a reasonable price, be smarter about what you say in front of a customer, and for god sakes accept debit/credit cards. We're not in the stone ages, and let's not make the stereotype that asians are cheap/stingy any more true than it already is.

I don't even feel like Rickrolling this place, sigh.........if Rick Astley were here he would just face palm himself."}
{"text":"If you don't know about this place then STOP what you are doing right now and go get one of their sandwiches.  It's cheap and good.  That's it!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This Lee's sandwich suck.  All California Lee's sandwiches even the ghetto one  are much better.  Dakao sandwich by Lindell and Spring Mountain is better."}
{"text":"the food was good and so was the iced coffee but they really did not want to give me much coffee. the first time i went there i got a regular size iced coffee and it was more like a cup of ice with coffee. it was delicious so i decided to go the following day, i ordered another iced coffee, this time i asked for less ice. when i got my coffee, it was filed up 3/4 way, i asked the cashier sarcastically \"you guys dont fill up the cup\" and all he told me was \"u asked for less ice\". it was disappointing, i would look for  new place with good iced coffee because they just dont really want to give you your money's worth,"}
{"text":"I order a sandwich with extra pate and they did not put any pate for it and i have to wait for about 10 mins . Bad experience fot the first time"}
{"text":"I love Lees...this one just sucks. Crappy service, only when the owner/manager there is it any good. Today they left me on the phone for 5 minutes and just forgot about me.

It's tough to get good staff, especially in Vegas. I think these guys maybe suck at hiring, otherwise everything is great.

I'm a special #11, pate chaud, tall iced coffee kind of guy. In case you're wondering"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I love the grilled pork (#5) and put soy sauce and sweet and sour on top. I've been coming here since it opened!

Why 3 stars? There's no one in line and it took me 20 mins to get my sandwiches. Flipping Chili's target goal is 15mins for your family's entire meal.  This place thinks 20 mins is appropriate for sandwiches?"}
{"text":"No better place in the valley to get really good banh mi sandwiches. The bread is always crunchy and firm loaded with fresh veggies. And for the cost, I always stock up on numbers 1 and 11 (if you like pate), ask for extra jalapenos if you want spice. Yes it is that bad I know the menu by number. And if you aren't adventurous to try the Asian sandwiches, they have an American menu of ham and cheese, and whatever else I don't pick up that you can get at Subway. The frozen boba drinks are delish, taro being my fave flavor. Pick up a few of the steamed pork buns because they are huge with enough protein from the egg, chinese sausage and mushroom stuffing. Trust me under $20, you will walk out with enough food to feed a linebacker appetite."}
{"text":"I had the #6 BBQ Pork...They could put more meat on the sandwiches BUT that might take away from the awesomeness of what they are serving. The bread and its crunchiness is #1 with me followed by the different ingredients on these sandwiches compared to your typical Deli Sandwich = thinly sliced carrot, jalapeno and stuff I dont know LOL!!. They do serve Deli style sandwiches but why do that when you can have something different. And the price is right = $3.39.

I am a former General Manager of a Steakhouse and I KNOW that if the owner is taking care of the little things, more than likely they have already covered the Big things. You can see by the cleanliness of the restroom = Ice in the Urinals!! That they are on the ball. I like the dining room also with the Large screen TV;s and the big over sized booths. 

So if you are in China Town, stop in and enjoy a nice sandwich. Why not? I cant think of a reason. : )"}
{"text":"Forget the haters. I would kill for this place to be next to my university's campus. My Viet friends all love this place. I like to think they know something the haters don't. My sandwiches were full of lots of meat, the right amount of condiments, and were served on very fresh bread.

And I ask the haters.... where else are you getting superior Banh Mi sandwiches at this price, level of cleanliness, and similarly easily-reached location? Sure you can get a more homestyle Banh Mi in a hole in the wall and even then it isn't THAT much better.

Honestly it's a Banh Mi sandwich. It's a really simplistic food.  If they screw it up there's no way they'd stay in business with the amount of competition in this area. From what I understand it is downright cutthroat in that area."}
{"text":"Wow. I ordered 2 sandwiches and one of them was adequate, but the other one  (for my husband) had 1 thin slice of ham and 1 thin slice of turkey on it. Way too much lettuce and barely any mayo. Completely tasteless.  Step it up guys!  There is a Capriotti's less than a mile away that never disappoints!"}
{"text":"It continues hands down to have most affordable and highest quality coffee, bingets, eggrolls, baguette sandwiches.
Get the Asian combo meal with number 6 pork. Get the cafe americano or iced Vietnamese coffee. Try the 3 sesame balls or bingets. The fresh baguettes are the best warm and fresh bread. Their coconut waffles are the bomb."}
{"text":"Stopped by here to pick up some sandwiches for our zion hike and was not impressed. The special sandwich lacked flavor and the coconut waffle was very dense and also lacked flavor.  The grilled pork sandwich was decent.  We also ordered the triple shot Lee's coffee but it tasted watered down."}
{"text":"I went to this place after drinking at the Golden Tiki. I got the turkey club and Thai iced tea. The sandwich was very tasty and the baguette was fresh. The sandwich had the perfect amount of mayo - usually sandwiches are too dry for my taste. The tea was also good - it was kind of like an iced latte. Overall, I really liked it and I would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Horrible! This place didn't even deserve a star! I order 1 sandwich and it took 20min to make and this was at 4:26pm they where not busy. When I got the sandwich (number 11) it only had TWO Slices of meat and a tons of carrots. This place has gone to the dumps the only thing health about this place is your jaw gets a workout from chewing the hard French bread! I'd rather go to subway and I hate subway. I'll never go here again.

***Look at every French roll sandwich picture and you can see the amount of meat if you can see the meat at all!***"}
{"text":"Loved this place! My first experience with Lee's  and I definitely will be back for more. Good sandwiches on awesome bread. What's not to love. Open 24hr too. Can't complain!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I always get the BBQ pork sandwich and it's delicious every time. Definitely worth trying :)"}
{"text":"Very cool little deli in china town. Coming from Wisconsin where delis are on every street corner, I know my sandwiches. Not only do they have fresh ingredients but  hey make their bread and croissant in house. It's an Asian/euro fusion and they have many choices in both styles to suit anyone's preference. They also have bahn bao steamed buns!!! Must try! The food is great and the establishment is clean. Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been meaning to try it for the longest time and I know I will be back! The baguettes are perfect and I love the distinction between the tradition Vietnamese sandwiches and the European. Also, the food is on the cheap here! It would cost me more to make the sandwiches at home (at least the traditional side of the menu). I paid for myself and two other people and spent less than $11. That made me so happy! I highly recommend this place and remember...

BRING CASH! BRING CASH! BRING CASH!"}
{"text":"Very good Vietnamese sandwiches! Always well prepared and given to you in a timely manner. I'm always satisfied when I'm here."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I used to always want Vietnamese bánh mì sandwiches in LA. I got them from the Nom Nom truck and when I moved to Arizona I was so sad! Until I found this place. Now it is my boyfriend and my favorite place to go :-) 

Get the number five. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Whenever I am in this part of the Valley, which isn't often, I try to stop by Lee Sandwiches because they are so different and delicious.  To me, the bread is what distinguishes Lee's sandwich - they have mastered the baguette.  It's so fresh.  

The sandwiches are European (ham, turkey, pork, etc.) or Vietnamese (various preparations of pork, pate, etc.) on a baguette or croissant.  They are mostly bread but the bread is so good that it's worth it.  

I wish Lee's would move the signs describing the food over to the left so that you could see it while waiting in line (which you will do here).  As it is, you can only see the possibilities when you get to the order station.  

I also think that when it's busy, you can wait in line for a long time and then wait to receive your order for a long time.  So don't think you will be able to rush in and rush out."}
{"text":"We just had Pho yesterday so we decided to go to Lee's sandwiches for a quick fix. Such a bad choice this time. The sandwiches there are way worser than the ones in San Jose. The place is huge but so little snacks or drinks available. The pate spread isn't tasty. The staff here were not friendly. The Vietnamese coffee isn't the best that I've drank (too sweet). The grilled pork was too dry and the vegetables pickled were so sweet."}
{"text":"Somehow this place is one of my go to spots when I hit sin city now. Their sandwiches are good. I always get the #14 meatloaf w/pate no onions, no cilantro. I'm gonna try their BBQ pork next time as that seems to be ordered every time someone ahead of me orders it. Service is good but the wait is super SLOW! Their sugar cane drink was pretty good too and was the best I've had so far ."}
{"text":"FLAKY croissants!!

The bread is baked fresh here. They have the best breakfast sandwiches.

The coffee is high octane. It will get you going for the day. The place is a must-do!

I ordered a baguette for $1.95. It was just baked. Nice and warm."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places to go for inexpensive and delicious food :) I like to order the BBQ  pork sandwich. Very yummy! Also, depending on the day you purchase the sandwiches, it can get hard very fast so I would eating it right away! They have many great  choices so I would recommend trying the different foods!"}
{"text":"While traveling, broke, and working at a big convention that overcharges for crappy food (and no Asian food options), I was elated that there was a Lee's sandwhich, so that I could buy some good and affordable lunch for the next day.  This literally was a haven for me and reminded me of being at home in the 626.  Well if you've been to Lee's before, you know what to expect in general.  This Lee's though is huge!! They have several booth seats, a large snacks and drinks section as well, AND free wifi!! yes! I was so relaxed sitting here chilling with wifi and so satisfied with my cheap banh mi.  So happy knowing that I wouldn't have to pay $13 the next day for some crappy convention food."}
{"text":"It was not the hype I was hearing.  I had much much better in DC area."}
{"text":"#5 pork sandwich, YUM! Bring cash and an appetite."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for baguettes and banh mi!!!! They literally have a baguette factory in their store! The sandwiches are so inexpensive!!!! (But please remember CASH only) they have unique taste and treats from all over asia, they also serve breakfast sandwiches, we have gone there numerous times for their delicious croissant ham sandwiches! For lunch or dinner I usually go with a grilled pork banh mi and my husband usually gets a blt on a croissant which he told me it's amazing every time!! For the price and freshness and amount of food it's so worth to go try it!!!"}
{"text":"It's spacious, plenty of seating one of the biggest Lee's I've seen and I've been to a lot of them in The OC.  The service is average the tables are pretty dirty. They don't clean them enough. Restrooms are nasty.  Positive is that this place is open 24/7 so if you need to get your Vietnamese Ice Coffee fix or Ban Mi on at 3am go ahead and do it lol! Food is just what you expect from Lee's! Good Sandwiches and fresh bread!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich, fresh ingredients, fair price. 

The racks of stuff before you make it to the deli counter are pretty neat. They have some pretty strange stuff. 

I thought the DMV style number reader that blasted out through the entire deli was an odd touch. Now serving A110.... A110.... Glad they move faster than the DMV, I was pretty hungry."}
{"text":"I liked the sandwich I ordered. The bread was stupid fresh, the veggies on the sandwich were crunchy, and the tea was brewed fresh so I left full. My only issue with this place is 1. they only accept cash, so I had to spend extra money pulling money out from the ATM, and 2. it took like, 15 minutes to get my sandwich and there were people who ordered after me who got their food first.."}
{"text":"The bread is super tasty.  Sandwiches are good but how hard would it be to use white meat chicken for the chicken sandwich and have fresh cut cheese for the sandwiches?  Considering this is a sandwich place, how about you serve top quality products?  Staff is always friendly but like I said, FRESH CUT CHEESE and MEAT would be so much nicer."}
{"text":"There's just too much going on here for my adhd self. These are the sandwiches I grew up on coming from a south east Asian family in California. This is not like the lees in cali, then again it's Vegas. With that being said sandwiches are regular, many things are a bit over priced, if you need snacks and Asian desserts and drinks sf market and ranch 99 are down the street you could get like three for the price of one lol. If you want a really good sandwich take your chances on that hole in the wall. Unless you like busy loud places. I figure I can go back home and get that at a one of my family gatherings lol"}
{"text":"I would give them a zero as a score if i could.  My experience here was awful! I've been to multiple Lee's sandwich around the states, and this have got to be the worst one of them all.

The ingredients are old, cold, and definitely not fresh. Tasted sour and spoiled to be honest. One of the banh mi we ordered is the bbq pork. They cooked it with onions. Never in Vietnam bbq pork has there ever been bbq pork with onion stirfried. It was disgusting!!! 

Never again! Please do not support this business. Obviously Lee's sandwich did not standardized all of their chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I usually come here to pickup a few baguettes that are fresh and right out of the oven. Despite this, I will have to agree on some of the recent negative ratings. 

They are really stingy on the ingredients. For example, a 4-dollar Thai ice tea I ordered contained over 50% ice, and when I asked them to remove some ice and replace it with more tea, they refused and said something to the effect that refills were not allowed even though I had not yet consumed any. 

On a side note, there is a sign at the register that reads, \"in order to keep prices low we only accept cash.\" In my opinion, their prices are fair, but by no means low.

In the future, I certainly won't go out of my way to patronize this establishment. I'll be doing them a favor since I don't want to break their profit margin by asking for less ice in the drinks!"}
{"text":"Lets just say that any place that has footlong sandwiches for less than $3 automatically gets at least 3 stars. I've had sandwiches in more authentic places and honestly, they werent that much better. For those people who are not so keen into the Vietnamese style sandwiches they do have delicious sandwiches on buttery broissants for not too much more. Lee's seems to do a little bit of everything, and they do it pretty decently. The smoothies and boba here are pretty run of the mill, nothing too special. The gelato is sub-par compared to other places nearby. However, the danishes and baked goods are pretty good and all for a good price. I would stay away from the lettuce-ridden goi-cuon(vietnamese summer rolls) and the pate chauds which are more of a hassle to clean up than anything and way too much work to get at the tiny ball of pate in the middle. Some shining stars there are the grilled pork sandwich, the special combination sandwich, and the hot ham and cheese croissant pastries(make sure to get there early so these are fresh).  Don't forget to bring cash although they do have an atm right in the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Moody employees & a big fat liar .. I ask for hot sauce she said no more hot sauce & I said can you check in back & she brought a lot OF them damn liar"}
{"text":"Heard about it.. driven by it... and now I've tried it!
Clean, modern vibe with a helpful staff!


We were headed to BJ's and I made the comment to my husband that I had heard great things about this place and that they were out of California. He suggested to eat there, which I thought would be better for lunch, but it made for a nice casual dinner!

Our girls with us, we decided to order several different items off the menu and share it all. The chicken wings were incredible. I'm not a big fan like my family, but they were hot, crisp and had a kick... If you're craving chicken wings.. try them out. 

We also ordered the Roasted Pork sandwich.. Great pork topped with pickled vegetables and jalepeno on a soft and crunchy Baguettte. Fantastic choice. The meat was tender and flavorful and the vegetables added just the right amount of crunch and great flavor. 

We also ordered the steamed pork and egg bun. The bun was nice and soft, the pork meatball was flavorful and the hard boiled egg, was just that, and egg. It was a bit dry, and I think I might have been looking for the flavor of the BBQ pork buns when eating dim sum. 

We ordered the Shrimp & Pork Spring rolls, which are made ahead of time. If they were made fresh to order, the taste would be much different. Instead the rice paper wrap was chewy. The dipping sauce was mediocre. Not enough peanut flavor. 

We also got a BLT on a baguette, great choice. First time I had seen red onion on a BLT,  It was still good. 

Looking forward to going back, and I'm sure I'll order the roasted pork sandwich again! It's that good!"}
{"text":"I don't get it they just started charging an extra 25 cents per item on top of the regular price when you order between the hours of 9pm to 5am.  When I asked the cashier why she just said its business... well if you ask me its bad business!  They did just added slot machines???  Are these extra fees to cover the small video poker winings?"}
{"text":"Worst bahn mi I've ever had! So much grizzle, I had to take all the meat out. So much mayo I couldn't even enjoy the veggies. Yuck! And all the while, they were mopping the floor around me. Overall a very unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with fresh baguettes?? However I tried their croissants and they tasted like yeast and eggy... but the baguettes are perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing, the service is fast, the sandwhiches are so filling, and the price you can't beat!!!!!"}
{"text":"**Cash only or a $10 credit card minimum**
How does this Lee's get it right, but the Cali locations can't? We had plans to come here to just pick up a few fresh french baguettes for our lunch during the week, but it seems like Lee's had other plans for us. We ended up ordering a whole slew of things.

5 baguettes - somehow their bread at this location wasn't rock hard and didn't cut the roof top of our mouth. Even after a couple days and after toasting, the bread was still tasty and tasted fresh. Great for making toast points for bruschetta, wine and cheese night, or making homemade banh mi sandwiches. 5/5

1 banh mi dac biet (special combination sandwich)- we asked for extra veggies and meat for an additional price. They did not disappoint, they packed the meat and the pickles on high. The sandwich was stuffed to the brim. 5/5

1 nuoc mia (cold pressed sugar cane drink)- this is the most refreshing drink on a hot day if it's done with fresh sweet sugar cane. Maybe the sugar cane they used the day I came was on its way out and way too ripe, it had an off taste to it, like it was almost ready to rott. We didn't enjoy it and couldn't finish it. 1/5

2 cha gio (Vietnamese egg rolls)- this is my favorite here, they are small and always crispy and hot. They are addicting! 5/5

3 banh tieu (hollow donut)- this is also one of my favorites growing up. I love the slight sweetness to them. Either eat it fresh, or take it home and toast it till its slightly crispy. It's good when it's a little crunchy. 5/5

2 pate chaud (pork pie)- the pork pies were all dough and barely a dot of meatball inside. It also tasted like they should have baked it for a little while longer since the dough inside tasted raw. 1/5

1 pate container- great for spreading onto thier toasted French baguettes, or when you make banh mi at home. 5/5

2 day old croissants for 99 cents- any of their day old bread is a good deal it's all 99 cents. 5/5

This place is not only huge inside, but also has ample comfortable booth style seating. The place is bright and has a wide open floor plan, but they could really use someone out in front tidying up the tables."}
{"text":"I was just not that impressed with the sandwiches.  I would rather buy the baguette they make there (the kids enjoy watching that) and make my own sandwiches at home."}
{"text":"There was this one time my friend wanted to buy some food from here and the first thing we wanted were \"Boba.\" It was rather disappointing that they didn't have it. Not only that but the guy upfront got annoyed with us because we asked for \"Boba\""}
{"text":"Yummy! I know it is a sandwich shop but who doesn't crave a good sandwich from time to time? This is certainly the place. The employees were friendly and prompt, I called in the order so I could use run in to pick it up and it was ready within the time they told me. Food tasted great and they were busy busy busy! I will be back :-)"}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Lee's today after a year of living here . Can't believe I waited so long to try it. Went around 12:30 pm, no wait. I had the #14 (pork roll and pate) and a couple pork and shrimp spring rolls. Loved the sandwich,  just the right portion size on it's own. The pate is GREAT. The banh mi toppings are perfect, sweet and spicy! (I did order extra jalapeños). Next time I will try the #18 (cured pork and pate) and bring some pate home. They have a great little grocery and snack selection in store. Didn't have cash with me, didn't realize as a first timer they have a $10 limit on debit card transactions.  The girl at the counter was very nice and ran my card anyways because I didn't know. Will definitely be back (with cash) very soon!"}
{"text":"This place is pure heaven!  

Get the steamed pork buns....I haven't had ones that good since California....I had the pork sandwich too, very light but flavorful."}
{"text":"Oh banh mi, how I love the, your pickled veggies and meat, they don't taste like.... Feet? So.... Maybe I'll stick to the actual reviews and not poetry. 

I first came here a couple years ago, as a recommendation from a friend. I usually get the chicken banh mi, and a vegetarian one and put it in the freezer (for later on that night TBH). The mayo and bread are so good, I would recommend getting here earlier for really fresh bread. And beware, I've gotten a mouth full of jalapeño midway through the sandwich, which was mildly amusing to my date.

ALSO. Cash only! They do have an ATM inside though, in case of emergency.y"}
{"text":"Their grilled chicken sandwich was fresh and tasty, however they are a little bit stingy on the meat - not much in there."}
{"text":"Combo banh mi + Vietnamese Coffee

This location is in a strip mall and to me had quite a bit of parking.  I ordered the combo banh mi with extra pate and a coffee to go.  The dining area is huge and there was quite a bit of people that day,  they effortlessly went through the line and I received my sandwich and coffee in less than 5 min.  We took it back to the hotel and I was impressed with the size and filling.  Not only was there a decent amount of meat for me, but quite a bit of pickled vegetables.  The crunch in the bread made polish off the entire sandwich(also just finishing working out helped).  The coffee was sweet and served as a dessert.  Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I like their sandwiches from here.  I ordered the #17 the last time.  Hubs likes the BBQ pork and daughter likes the grilled pork."}
{"text":"An ammendment to my previous review.

First off let me say that their food is amazing. The bread is fantastic and the bahn mi and egg rolls are great. That being said I ordered 3 sandwiches and egg rolls. Cost me nearly $40 because there is a $9.00 delivery fee. Order was missing a whole sandwich! Not forgetting some little thing, a SANDWICH, which is what they do! Called and was told they can give me a free sandwich in the future. Hello...I paid for a sandwich, it's not free. Just spoke to the manager and she told me they won't refund my money. Seriously? They will give me a \"free\" sandwich but not refund my money. I argued and she started raising her voice and arguing back.It's 8:00 pm and I'm not driving all the way down there for a sandwich when the rest of my family has already finished theirs. 
Bottom line...food is great but customer service crap. Seriously angry right now."}
{"text":"Hahaha. Can one write a review on a place they were at, but quite drunk at the same time? Yup, I was THAT girl - passed out in one of the booths while her friends are ordering.

I remember that there were crumbs on the table, the seating areas, and the place wasn't too clean - but it was open until the wee hours of the night. Perfect for the after hours munchies. 

They have great iced coffee, so make sure you grab some!

I'm glad they picked me up a sandwich - it was great the next morning. But what can I say? There's nothing that totally stands out with this place. So... A-ok. 

Lee's is located on Spring Mountain Rd - the \"Chinatown\" \"Asian\" area of Vegas. There's plenty of parking, no valet needed. Cheapie food, open til the wee hours."}
{"text":"Sorry I know this place is popular...just not a fan for several reasons.

1) No hot subs...i'm just not a fan of cold sandwiches
2) Learned what baguettes are...hard bread = stale bread to me
3) Cash only...had to use ATM with atm & bank fees

Lemonaid is good, could only eat half my ham & cheese sandwich...

went across the street to eat a bigmac which i would also give 2 stars for..."}
{"text":"\"Meh\" about sums it up.  The best part of Lee's is the iced coffee.   The sandwiches were pretty lack luster.  Lacking in flavor and they don't even provide cock sauce or hoisin.    To compound the mediocrity, they don't accept cc.  I'll take my business up the street to Hue Thai and get a bowl of pho to go along with my sandwich. Supposedly free wifi is a plus and open 24 hours."}
{"text":"So my bird wants to meet at Lee's yesterday for lunch. I've, as I was later reminded, heard of it before but I didn't remember that hearing event. So I'm going into this lunch blind knowing absolutely nothing about this place. And I get there and look at the picture of the vegetarian sandwich on the wall and it looks horrible. HORRIBLE! So I think to myself, if they're advertising something that looks that horrendously awful how good could the food be? So I'm there with my boy Richard Z and he's like \"Dude, don't be stupid. The food here is good.\"  So I don't believe him. I say \"This is suspect.\" So I text my bird who's driving there and I say, \"Have you actually eaten here before? This place is suspect.\" Now, the Bird's having a bad day and she's like \"*@*&#^&%$)@$#&*@#^*&@!!!\" I respond \"Ok, can't wait to see you, Suga.\" I was all smiles are charms yesterday. 

So she gets there and I'm in such a good mood I can't even contain myself enough to order so she is forced to order for me and she orders me what she orders herself, which is a Tai tea with boba and an egg salad sammy. Despite my initial reservations I was pleasantly surprised. It was really freakin' good. Tai tea with boba was interesting. An aquired taste that I was able to aquire 3/4 of the way through. 

So today, feeling less like a petulant child and more like a man. A man's man... I went back to get the actual sammy that I wanted yesterday but was too fricken angry to order. What, do you ask, drove me back the next day? The veggie avacado on a croisant. Other than the avacado being kinda gross, the sandwich was absolutely amazing. So I would recommend this place to my grandmother with a weak stomach. It's just really good. I'm sorry, dearest Lady, for my tresspasses."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sandwiches ever! Cheap too (bring cash). I have had almost all the sandwiches, and they are all good, but roast pork is the best. Also, try the pate chaud (baked buns with meat inside) and the steamed buns! Me, my wife, and kids love them both! I also really enjoy the honey chrysanthemum tea! You can get a ton of food for cheap and its awesomely delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to quite a lot of Lee's Sandwishes in southern cal and this place was packed. I figured what can go wrong. I have to say my Banh Mi was really nasty (I didn't even finish it, it's that bad). I usually love any Vietnamese style coffee. I have no idea who made mine coffee, but the drink I got was the worst tasting drink I've ever had in the last 10 years. I had such a bad taste in my mouth I felt sick for the rest of the day. I had to buy bottle water just to rinse the taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"I LOVE LEE'S COFFEE, AND BOBA. I like there Sandwishes also. And their coconut waffles are awesome. It sucks sometimes they have a wait. But it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Why does everyone talk about how good the banhmi is here? Its OK! i guess its only good because the bagguette is freshly baked in the store. It lacks flavor and the coi cuon had way too much noodles. The coffee is very good though!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches and iced coffee are to die for! Would recommend the Combination sandwich. They pair nicely together. The cashier that rang me up was extremely friendly, he is doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Actually this place taste alittle better than the ones in San Jose. I am impressed. 

Pros: Opens 24hrs, cha and banh mi taste better than the locations in San Jose, Nice place to relax and chill with friends:

Cons: Hard to find parking, price is alittle more than the ones in other locations in the bay

Still a great place to eat good cheap foods compare to other places in Vegas..I would say better than Mcdonalds..."}
{"text":"Coming from Socal they all taste similar, but i think here the bread is made much better and its not chewy! Clean place and they are quick, if you're looking for a quick bite! Ice coffee is just great!!!! Cant go wrong with the Vietnamese Ice Coffee!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here once every few weeks to get my \"Cafe sua da\" fix, as well as a bite to eat. I usually get the chicken sandwich or a pandan waffle, and I'm always satisfied with both. Additionally, you can tell the bread for the sandwich is freshly baked and the waffle is put in the waffle iron right in front of you.

Service is always efficient, although wait times can vary depending on how busy they are."}
{"text":"The dilemma Asian or European style?  You guessed it! I have been eating euro style my entire life this night will be different...Asian it is.  The baguette was really good. They have a bread making factory pumping out this crunchy goodness every second. The croissants are very fresh, buttery and like a true Californian flakey also.  

The Asian meats choices were very different both in cut and texture. The yellow mayo was slightly sweet unlike best foods style but it was good.  I like the pickled veggies and cilantro and divided about the slivered jalapeño.  

I liked the combo offer that comes with egg rolls instead of chips.  This location is opened 24 hours and has plenty of seating for late night chillin. Give something different a try....you might like it."}
{"text":"The Asian sandwiches and the chicken/pork and egg buns (bánh bao) were doughy and had dry fillings. Highly unpleasant. The customer service was even worse. The day after the purchase, we realized they had a buy any sized Asian sandwich get a regular-sized coffee free promotion since August 9th. We had purchased 2 Asian sandwiches, and the cashier asked if we wanted a large-sized coffee without letting us know of the promotion. Thus we were charged full price. Even though we could have gotten 2 free regular-sized coffees, she took advantage of our ignorance and purposely led us to believe buying the large-size was the better deal. We shall most likely not be returning."}
{"text":"Pros: 

-Amazing iced coffee (cafe sua da).
-Great croissant sandwiches.
-Good place to hang out due to ample seating and decent wifi.

Cons:

-I hate the stamp card because they started using Epoxy, which is not only slow, but has a terrible user interface. 
-I prefer softer baguettes
-Some items overpriced."}
{"text":"Lee's is amazing, tons of sandwiches [veg and carnivore] with good flavors for really cheap!

Plus you can buy mini baguettes to take home for only 50 cents.

Just make sure you bring cash because they don't take cards.
Besides that, it's a killer deal all around."}
{"text":"delicious sandwiches, fresh baguettes, really cool place! and they apparently do take card now!"}
{"text":"Like many others I have been waiting and waiting for the Vegas edition of Lee's to open. How many times have we all rubbernecked while cruising down Spring Mountain only to see the place still under construction?

I ventured in around lunch time and the place was packed. Fortunately efficiency is one of their strong points at Lee's so before long I had my grubby hands on a #11 Special Combination. And then, the disappointment. The bread was a little dry, the pickled veggies a little bland and there was not enough mayo/pate. I don't expect the best sandwich when I go into Lee's but I do hope for a decent one.

It did seem like many of the workers were still in training so let's hope the quality improves in the coming weeks. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"when the place opened a few years ago, it was the coolest place to be.  really clean, excellent presentation and great value.  the asian sanwiches were a scream at around $2.50 + tax.

i would eat there 2-3 times a week because the sandwiches were such a deal and seemed like a nice light meal.

i do have a few complaints though

1)they only accept cash, so i find myself saving all my change and dumping it on them just to make a point

2)they have this take out window that's supposed to reward the customer who calls in their order in advance.  i don't know what the criteria is, but it's always hit and miss as to when it is open.  is it that difficult to open the sliding window and take my cash?   what's the point of me calling in my order and having to wait in a long line of customers just to hand them the rolls of pennies that i've saved up during the week?

3) they have slowly started raising their prices (a nickel here, a dime there) and now the cheapest sandwich is starting to creep up to the $3.00 mark.  call me a cheapskate, but i'm going to cut down my 2-3 time/week to 2-3 times a quarter.

4) the last time i ordered the #1, it tasted pretty awful (could it be that i was just coming off of the flu?)  or was it because i was caught off guard with the new price increase?  luckily i leave an extra roll of pennies in my truck for such emergencies

i doubt they'll miss my patronage"}
{"text":"I wish there were more places like this in the west side of the valley. Bomb food. Bomb coffee. Bomb Sandwiches"}
{"text":"Another visit to Vegas and of course we had to stop by this sandwich spot again. The last time, I got the combo, but didnt like it as much... so this time, I got 1 from the Asian side (Chicken Banh mi) and 1 from the European side (Lee's club) and both with the baguette.  

The chicken banh mi was good, but definitely Lee's club was better. More flavorful!  The texture of the bread still have not failed me. So gooooood!"}
{"text":"Breakfast on the go!  Exactly what I had anticipated.  No hassle lines or crowding.  Able to get in/out.  And there is PLENTY of parking.  Many thanks for having another location on this side of the valley."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Lee's Sandwiches in southern california. The bread is fresh, and warm, and perfectly crunchy. All the comforts that a nice sandwich should have. 

For first timers: remember, these are Vietnamese sandwiches. The Baguette sandwiches are a little different than what you'll get at Subway. They come with pickled veggies and pate and they really are delicious if you want to be adventurous. If you're looking for a more americanized sandwich try their Crossant Sandwiches. Here's where you'll find your typical roast beef, turkey, cheese, etc. 

I subtracted a star because you have to pay 0.50 for refills. BOO! Other than that I have absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"I just had the ice cream. That was when I didn't know where to go for ice cream. It tasted artificial, much like how everything else looked. There was also a weird feeling about the place - too self-consciously \"cute\"  suspension of reality - almost as if a crime was imminent like a bad TV show. Looking at the rest of the food was almost disturbing - like school cafeteria food, only worse. Oh well, it discouraged me from eating anything the whole rest of the day."}
{"text":"The line for this place is very long and we did have to wait a little bit for the drinks. It seems pretty busy and a lot of friendly people working. There is enough places for people to sit, drink, and eat. The place is fairly clean and nothing seems to be out of place. I ordered the iced coffee. It tasted pretty strong which is how I like my coffee. They did add a little too much ice, but it will help water the coffee down for those who do not like the strong taste of coffee. Other than that service was good and drinks were great! I recommend this place, but come early if you're on a timed schedule because this place gets packed quick!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big on sandwiches but theirs are rather tasty. The pastries they have are on point. Try the coconut waffle...it's green but delish! The fact they are open 24 hours is just a bonus! They also sell some typical Asian goodies like cookie, snacks, pocky, and a few bottles beverages. Worth a stop for a meal if you want to check it out."}
{"text":"I went here with my cousin to have a quick lunch. Despite there being only three other customers, we both waited 20 minutes for each of our banh mi's, which we thought was a little too long.

The actual restaurant itself is very large and has a lot of seating. They also have a variety of snacks that they sell in addition to the sandwiches, boba, and iced coffee. Some tables were sort of messy though and it looked like they weren't going to be cleaned soon. 

My cousin and I both ordered the #6 BBQ Pork Banh Mi and we both really liked it. For $5-$6, it was easily worth the money."}
{"text":"Really good bread! My sandwich was good also, I couldn't find a health code grade anyplace visible
But the place appeared to be clean. Good service! Only mild complaint is they have the smallest bag of chips that I've ever seen that come with the meal."}
{"text":"I tried their BBQ pork sandwich, of all the places I've tried, it was bottom of the barrel. Bread was blah, barely enough of anything inside. Was on the dry side. I've had much better  sandwiches here in Sacramento and only cost $2.5 for a bigger tastier sandwich. Place looked nice but that's it."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches has always been a pleasant place to go since it opened in Chandler years ago. From what I remember it was cheap and delicious. When I went back today, I found it to be cheap in a different way, as well.

I ordered the #17 (Jambon and Pork) on a croissant and a large thai iced tea with no ice. 2 items, $9. Not quite the Lee's I remembered. They called my number and I walked up to get my food. Croissant sandwich, check. No ice in my drink, check. Thai iced tea...half check. My large cup was only half full (not being optimistic). Quite literally half full. I picked up my cup and asked where the rest of my drink was and was told that I ordered no ice (well duh). I told him I didn't order \"no drink\" and he said he wouldn't give me what I paid for.

Very very disappointed. The only thing that saved Lee's from 1 star was the delicious sandwich.

Food - 4 stars
Customer service - no stars"}
{"text":"I love there sandwiches, we usually get the Grilled Chicken or BBQ Pork. The Egg Rolls are a good side too. But their coffee or my favorite Iced Thai Tea with Boba are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!  I ordered #11 special combination when I got my sandwich there's no mayonnaise in it. I asked the cashier for the mayonnaise because there's no mayo in my sandwich.  She answered, \" I'm not the sandwich maker I don't know!\" I have to take my sandwich and flag the staff in the back to get my mayo.  Later that cashier was speaking Vietnamese to other employees and give me a look! I can tell if the look is friendly and mean. Lee Sandwich if you can't take care your customers take your business elsewhere we don't want you!  Leave!!"}
{"text":"Poor management, period!!  Last week at 5:15PM, Tuesday, July 10, 2012, we were there for some sandwiches.  Most of the Asian items were sold out.  Today July 15, 2012, we went back driving all the way from Peoria and arrived at 4:46PM, and the sign said, \"Hot Baguette\" yum!  We went inside ordered our combination sandwiches and some hot baguettes.  The cashier told us the all of the baguettes had sold out already but the hot baguette sign still left on.  This is false advertisement, people.  Also, the ingredients they put in the sandwiches are inconsistent, and it's franchise restaurant, seriously?"}
{"text":"Wow, this must be the flagship Lee's sandwich store. It's huge and sells all kinds of Vietnamese products from butter to kids jellies and from coffee beans to sugar cane juice. Soon to come are slots and video poker machines. So, you can have the perfect cure for a night of debauchery hangover, Banh Mi sandwich with jalapenos, sirracha sauce and a Ice Coffee and continue to gamble too. If your driving back home you have to get a couple of BBQ Pork or Special Combo #11 sandwiches for the road."}
{"text":"I've been here on multiple ocassions, the service is horrible everytime. I guess you can't blame them because they hired nothing but inexperienced 16 year olds and that's fine but man...get it together this is your only location here besides Chandler right? The food is very inconsistent on quality and honestly I feel Banh Mi Bistro is better as their quality is consistent. This place's grand opening served me a horrible sandwich doused in soy sauce the first time, and this was their premier day. I only go back to try to get some pastries in the morning but it's usually hit or miss."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! If I could give zero star I would. Holy crap I've never seen such an unorganized, inefficient and dysfunctional service system like this place. There is no order at all. Everything is so confusing and got held back. I was here on Sunday morning, super busy hour and there were only 4 people on the assembly line. Half of the time the people didn't even know whose orders are whose. The cashiers were confused and had their heads in their butts, running around figuring out orders back and forth handing out and wrapping food. This place is a goddamn mess. 

I only ordered 2 lees ice coffees and I saw my order on the counter for 15 minutes sitting there waiting till they finally noticed that the order was finished. Furthermore they only noticed after I pointed to them my coffees hanging on the counter. People were impatiently waiting and hovering for their food. Their system is so inefficient it's so frustrating for me standing looking at my order. The sandwiches I had here before were cold and chewy, poorly wrapped. 

I never had good experience here I very much dislike it. I would never bring a big group here for \"fast\" food. No good food can bring me back to this kind of service."}
{"text":"I don't usually get the sandwiches,  I am from LA area and the Lee's sandwiches there don't offer some of things this one does and I always stop in her everytime I come for the sesame balls and BBC pork Bao. So delicious!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are ok here. The baguette can be a little hard sometimes. The Vietnamese iced coffee is enjoyable but beware it is strong! Love all the pastries and treats they have, from beignets to the french horn. 

Bonus: Open 24 Hours"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and had the asian vegetable sandwich. The bread is fresh baked on site. Very european. Crunchy freshness on the outside and fluffy white on the inside. The kimchi was homemade and combined with jalepenos and crunchy vermacelli noodles. AMAZING. I also tried a bite of the pork - delicious!!!! Will definitely be back for the anchovie sandwich. I washed it down with the sweet goodness of vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Whenever I go here my usual is the #4 Grilled Chicken. For those that are noobs, its like pho but in a french baguette without the broth. I referenced Bruce Lee because they also put fresh sliced jalapenos in it. So if you arent expecting it, watch out! Gives you a really good kick to your taste buds! 

If you are not sure what to get, just get whatever every body gets by default when they go here for the first time. The #1 Combination. It has a lttle bit of everything in it. Well, not everything but if you wanna play it safe, this and the grilled chicken are safe picks.

For those that dont find the baguette sandwiches appealing, they have huge croissant sandwiches. Yes, they have European sandwiches. Not sure why they would have these because they are a Vietnamese sandwich place but it is good! Now these sandwiches are much more tolerable if you dont wanna get surprised with what is in them. You have choices like roast beef, turkey, and ham just to name a few. Im not gonna go over every little thing they serve cuz otherwise you will be falling asleep. 

They also have nice appetizers like hot wings and spring rolls along with a whole list of different flavored smoothies. Dont forget to throw some boba in there! Oh, also did I mention they have frozen yougurt as well?

Last but not least, a lot of people also get the ice coffee here. I have tried it myself and I gotta say, it does have a lot of flavor plus the caffeine you crave! Prices for the coffee are a little bit less than Starbucks which is a good thing.

NICE RANDOM INFO: Its nice that they are open 24 hours so if you got the munchies at 3 in the morning, you are set! Free wifi! You just need to ask. I think last time it was their business phone number. Last but not least, if you are there long enough, you can learn the numbers 1 to 99 in Vietnamese!

BAD RANDOM INFO: Just recently they started taking plastic but there is a minimm of a 20 dollar purchase. They should of just kept the cash only policy because if you dont have any cash than you have one of two choices. 1. Purchase more food than you planned. 2. Get money from their ATM which leads to more fees not only from the machine, but from your financial institution as well.

So every now and then, a trip to Lee's should be ok, hence the 3 stars. For more info on the rest of their menu, go to their website: www.leessandwiches.com"}
{"text":"It's a good place for both Asian and American style sandwiches. The sandwich that I got was a turkey sandwich, and it didn't disappoint. It wasn't mind blowing good, but I can definitely say, it surprised me and definitely hit the spot. My kids love coming here because of the different sweet treats they have, and most times, I have no choice but to get them some. If you're hungry and looking for a quick bite, this restaurant will definitely do the trick. Also, they have this massive bakery, my kids love watching it in action"}
{"text":"Just like any other Lee's chain store but this one is open 24/7. Their sandwich is okay. Nothing spectacular. Gets the job done with a decent price. I usually order a sandwich to go for later drunk food back at the hotel. It's cheap. Also the store sells other asian snacks such as chips, candy and breads. Now I want a sandwich!"}
{"text":"I love Lee sandwiches and lee's coffee. But, to day I am disappointed about counter service. I got here waiting in line since 12:35 pm there were only one cashier taking order. And I got my coffee and my sandwich at 1:05.  Pm. Think about it."}
{"text":"Good sandwich place.  Lots of Vietnamese sandwiches and super fresh bread because they make it there.  There are many other food options also but the sandwiches is why I would come here. 

Good prices and good sandwiches."}
{"text":"We accidently wound up here as we were looking for the Lobster truck.  I am glad we did, people so very nice, and one of the best sandwiches  outside my house.  I mean it was a no nonsense sandwich, not a lot of frilly stuff, meat (roast beef that tasted like roast beef not a salt lick) and the bread was OUTSTANDING.  We also had the chicken eggrole hands down better than the ones at my two fav Chinese places.  we will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"Been getting delightful Vietnamese sandwiches here as long as I can remember. Since moving to the west side of the valley, it has probably been 2-3 years since I've been here but my bf and I were in the area and had cash so we decided to go back to our younger days lol. Every Asian in Arizona has been here and we are no different. We love their 10 inches of yummy meat and veggies in a french baguette for less than $3.50 each. They got my order wrong the first time (gave me pork instead of chicken), but replaced it right away. The place is big with lots of tables and chairs to sit in. I noticed as we were choosing a seat that some tables were sprinkled with left over bread crumbs from the last patron enjoying their sandwich there so maybe a tad lack in cleanliness. However, Lee's Sandwiches will always have a place in my heart."}
{"text":"Like most Lee's Sandwiches places in SoCal - you get the consistently crispy on the outside (cutting the F out of the roof of your mouth) and soft on the inside yumminess baguette. You get your choices of meat, I normally get the #17 banh mi cha lua (pork roll) khong hanh (no onions) while the boyfriend get #5 banh mi thit nuong op la (charbroiled pork w/ sunny side eggs). I've been going to Lee's for about 16 years now and their meat portion seems skimpy these days. My sandwich had two thinly sliced pork rolls pieces. Really disappointing. I mean a girl needs her meat! 

One thing that's always dependable is their ca phe sua da (vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk) - always consistent and always soooo delicious. I always add coffee jelly to it and you use the boba straw with it.

Will I come back to this one, of course! It's the only one around...... until the Peoria opens up in a few months."}
{"text":"We are so Happy Lee's sandwiches opened in the SW!! lucky us
place is always clean and staff always pleasant.
if you come and bread is not hot or ready, just wait 5mns or less 
kids like sandwich #2 the steamed pork or #5 the pork BBQ. their mushroom and chicken steamed bun is yummy as well
italian soda passion fruit flavored is my favorite, asian coffee is addicting so i try to stay away from it
baguette is very good, light and crunchy (not too much dough)"}
{"text":"I have been eating Lee's sandwiches ever since I was a kid. We used to frequent the L.A. locations, so I was pleased to know there were locations close by ! I used to order the #6 but the barbecued pork was a little to fatty for my taste. 

This Lee's has a drive through which is awesome ! We came through and ordered 4 #5 the grilled pork , 2 # 12 vegetarian sandwiches and a taro smoothie with boba. 

It took about 10-15 minutes but it was well worth the wait! They make their baguettes fresh in the shop, and everything is made to order. I could see them making everything through the drive through window, and I was impressed to see their clean work station. 

I would recommend requesting extra mayo, and extra veggies. The pickled daikon is so delicious ! 

No spread came on the vegetarian sandwich, I don't know why but I would definitely request it, otherwise it's on the dry side. The vermicelli noodles in the sandwich are fried which I wasn't expecting but it was delicious.

The Taro smoothie was so good, I'm only sad there wasn't more of it. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"While we come here frequently because there are zero banh mi shops in AZ, I really hate that their thit nuong sandwiches have sometimes very little meat. Sometimes if you go too early, they run out of bread and you wait an eternity for the next batch. You'd think based off of supply and demand, they can gauge baking more bread so they don't run out. Their spring rolls are kinda gross. There eggrolls are standard. The chicken wings are like crack. They have MSG in them and are spicy. Their pastries are fresh looking but I have not tried them myself. I hate that they are cash only. Most obvious reason is to cheat taxes. In this day and age, cash is obsolete. You lose more customers that don't have cash than you save in fees."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches, I love their baguettes and croissants. Try their fresh squeezed lemonade, it doesn't disappoint. Just remember they are cash only."}
{"text":"I would rate this 3 stars on my banh mi sandwich scale but they get the one extra star for being the only one around out in this area. I used to live in Monterey Park, CA where banh mi shops were on every other corner and Lee's would probably be somewhere on the middle of my list of preferences. But I'm grateful to have this one out here in Chandler. Hey, beggars can't be choosers right?

I usually alternate between the grilled pork, cha (pork roll), and xiu mai (meatball) banh mi, with the grilled pork one being more frequent. The flavor is awesome. Meatballs are not the meatball with marinara type of sandwich. They are ground pork mixed with veggies formed into big round balls and steamed. There are about 4 large ones in each sandwich, I think. Each sandwich comes with pickled veggies (shredded carrots and daikon), sliced onions, jalapenos, and sprigs of cilantro and served on a 10 inch baguette that is baked in house. Their cafe sua da is good, too. It's strong, dripped vietnamese coffee with condensed milk over ice. Might make you feel cracked out if you are not a daily coffee drinker, like me.

My favorite thing here, however,  is the AVOCADO SMOOTHIE! Avocado Smoothie??? Ewww! You might think. That's what my coworkers said and now they are serious fans. If you like avocados... you will like this smoothie, trust.

Don't forget to bring cash unless you want to pay ATM fees. Or stop by Walgreens for a pack of gum and get cash back. Probably can use some gum for the hot breath you will get after eating the pickled veggies on your sandwich. Win-win."}
{"text":"If you don't eat meat and want a veggie sub, this is not the best option.

Walk in big bright and full of stuff, A fresh bread factory,  fresh cream cakes, gelato and off brand soft drinks.

The menu is full of options including some Vietnamese sandwiches, too bad they all had meat.

My veggie sub just had avocado, yellow I assume american cheese, and lettuce. The bread was good but for about $5 I want more in a sandwich."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Lee's in SoCal. So it was a pleasant surprise to find on in Chandler when I visited.  This one is modeled just like the other ones. It's big and spacious.  Lots of Banh Mi choices.  I had the Special and it was delicious just as I remembered from SoCal.  They also have pre-made desserts too. Love Lee's!"}
{"text":"Great morning staff.. but when I went on the weekend with my kids they wanted soda and the soda machine was down. I understand you guys barely opened but sucks you guys don't offer any soda for kids that doesn't drink the stuff you offer."}
{"text":"tldr

My go to place to eat at any given time. Clean bathroom.

Get:
-number 4 grilled chicken asian sandwich (no house pickles, no mayo)
-chicken/shitake steamed bun (make sure its fresh)
-deli manjoo"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I love their fresh bread, sandwiches snd of course the boba smoothies. 

I frequent this location and it's always busy but never a long wait to get helped/to get the food. My favorite is getting bread hot out of the oven- it's seriously divine."}
{"text":"Not the best sandwiches ever, but the best I've found so far in Vegas :) My favorite is the dac biet (special combo sandwich) and their spring rolls are AMAZING!!! Ok, 5 stars for the spring rolls!!!"}
{"text":"Although smaller than the Lee's on Spring Mt., this location has the same menu and is clean and airy. My grilled pork banh mi was absolutely yummy. And spicy! Take out the peppers if this is not your thing. The bread is always made fresh here and they also have these huge pork and egg baos for just $1.99 each. If you're looking for good cheap food, this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"March 25th, 2011

Ordered:
 Special Sandwich
 Ham/Cheese Croissant
 Iced Coffee
 Deep Fried Balls covered w/ Seasame (I don't know the name ha)
 Fried Egg Rolls

Pros:
* awesome layout.. The biggest Lee's I've seen!
* Lots of free samples to try.
* express line available for strictly pastries and coffee orders
* They have a room available for banquets and private affairs.

Cons:
* Rock Hard baguette bread !
* Minimal selection of asian sandwiches
* congested with traffic.
* I order deep fried pastries for dessert and they threw it in the same bag as my fried egg rolls.. who does that??

Tips:
* Go down the street to Mr. Sandwich
* I'm not a coffee fan, but its strong and good according to my gf
* easy on the ice for the ice coffee would be a most wise request.

  Okay, so I came during grand opening and ribbon cutting, which explains the crazy traffic (but I attempted to come again a few days later and it was still busy so I opted for good ol' Mr. Sandwich).  I've had Lee's before in California and remember taking a liking to it, but man their baguette's are just super hard!  The express lane was nice for those coffee drinkers and pastry lovers, but I was here for sandwiches.  The disappointing thing is that they tried to have a diverse palette of sandwiches by throwing in american sandwiches (ham and cheese) on croissant bread.  If I wanted an American sandwich, I'd go to Subway (or better yet Port-O-Subs).  The option of American sandwiches was interesting at first, but it isn't even tasty. Sure this added diversity, but it also limited their selection of Eurasian sandwiches.  I understand Lee's is a big name and the opening ceremony was a blast, but it just didn't win me over.  Will I be back?  Sure, but only because I got a free $5.00 gift card for coming during the grand opening.  Aside from that, I'm good with Hue Thai's or Mr. Sandwich for my Asian Sandwich cravings."}
{"text":"I've been in love with Lee's Vietnamese sandwiches since I was a kid back in SoCal and Texas. Saddened to find out the closest one to me now is 2 hours away, it's a treat when I get to have it. I usually order a bunch so I can take some home with me, ha! Their store is huge with many seating areas and has many options ranging from just the baked goods, to specialty drinks (including fresh, pure sugarcane juice!), to their sandwiches. I've enjoyed their Vietnamese coffee in the past before but that's all I've really explored besides their sandwiches. I recommend the BBQ pork sandwich as well as the Combination.
WARNINGS:
-They only take cash.
-The vegetables that come with the sandwiches contain jalapeños.
All in all, I highly recommend you check this place out if you're in Chandler. 5 sandwiches came to $16 and some change and they're pretty decent."}
{"text":"Definitely had better Bánh mi sandwiches at other places but for the price of under $3, they're OK. They have a selection of HUGE croissant deli sandwiches for cheap too. I usually get the grilled pork or barbecue pork Bánh mi. Can't really tell the difference. The restaurant is clean and brightly lit, like a cafeteria -- a good thing if you're out in that area at 1:00am. It's a pretty welcoming sight."}
{"text":"I took my mom there yesterday. It was her 80th birthday. The female staff was so rude to her, that was embarrassing. My mother asked for a cup of coffee with soy milk, and the staff refused to serve her. They end up charging us for extra soy milk, which we were happy to pay. They have to be more compassionate.  The establishment is more like a grocery store with a lunch counter. It is not clean, rude customer service, and the sandwich is very average. I would not recommend this place to anyone. It is an embarrassment!"}
{"text":"Limited parking. 

One of the biggest restaurant I've been too for this chain! 

Customer service is extra slow and not that great.

Restrooms abundant

Cleanliness is decent 

Coffee is yummy"}
{"text":"I'll admit it was hard to get used to the smell as you walk in, but I'm glad I did! I'm big on their baguette's which have the perfect crunch offering a great ratio when served with their sandwich meat. You can even buy day old bread at a steep discount to have with dinner! I normally opt for the turkey and cheese that comes out fairly quick. Give their dried fruits, smoothies, or one of their many pre-packaged oriental desserts a try. I love coming in when they are baking the bread for the day and the line always moves quickly. They have recently started accepting card so that's a major bonus!"}
{"text":"Never had a Vietnamese sandwich, its a good place to start ... the McDonalds of Bahn Mi. 

If your looking for the 'real thing' good luck in this valley. Lots & lots of poser's. 

Try the one over at 4 Peaks Brewery, it gets close to the real thing ... on a good day."}
{"text":"Food is good. Wait SUCKS. but considering i really wanted che of any kind....and spring rolls, i was willing to wait. no sense of system at this location."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's because I'm a relative novice when it comes to banh mi? Or, maybe it's because I'm a sucker for a clean, new resto that's within easy driving distance from the 15 on Spring Mountain? Either way, I had a great veggie banh mi at Lee's with some folks last week! Ratio of filling (very tasty, btw) to other stuff (cilantro, carrots, etc.) was spot on, and the bread was perfectly warm and flaky. YUM. It doesn't hurt that the honey chamomile iced tea was awesomeness in a glass. Negative points for the cash only option and the long wait for food. Because someone in our group ordered a smoothie, it took 25 minutes to make 3 sandwiches and tea -- smoothie lovers be warned! Other downer: the crazy parking lot -- I always feel like I'm going to get into 10 accidents!! Bottom line: will def. be back -- you really can't beat $3 for a yummy 'wich."}
{"text":"The wait is annoying, but the ingredients are usually fresh and super tasty so its totally worth it. ! I wish they had a beef option, but other than that, the bread is fresh and has the best crunch, the boba smoothies are tasty (i get blended coffee) But still, love stoping here for a cheaper lunch!"}
{"text":"The price here is nice and low, but you're paying for what you get. I haven't been to another Lee's before but I've had a lot of Vietnamese sandwiches, and this was very different. Their Euro sandwiches are pretty tasty though!

The sandwiches taste good but they can be pretty dry. I got the grilled pork, but it was pretty much a mayo sandwich since there was five times as much mayonnaise then there was of meat. The Thai tea was very strong, but also gritty.

It wasn't busy but it took fifteen minutes for one sandwich, which kind of sucked since I was in a rush. The interior is clean and they have snacks available for purchase. 

Less than stellar but a good, cheap meal."}
{"text":"OMG, Someone slap me upside the head with a baguette! I was in the strip mall Lee's is in trying to find parking on a Friday night.  The big red sign glowing caught my eye.  I had to make a mental note to check this place out.  Let's flash forward to now as I sat at my desk with the 1 million dollar question: \"What the heck do I want for lunch?\"  Just as I thought of the glowing red sign popped in my head.  I just in my truck and started my sandwich mission.  

When I arrived it was lunch time but the restaurant wasn't packed.  I had no idea what to order.  I had my phone in hand with mobile Yelp assisting me.  The only problem was that I couldn't get the dang pictures to load.  So I went in blind, luckily the girl at the counter was really friendly.  She asking what kind of sandwich I would like.  Once she went over the ingredients for an Vietnamese sandwich I was excited.  I ordered the bar b que pork and waiting for my number.  

As I was sitting I noticed they have free wi fi.  Once I got on the network I was able to view the pics of menu items.  I noticed the steam bun looked really good.  When my sandwich was ready I ordered a steam bun too.  It was only $1.99.  

Overall the the service was great.  The dining room needed to be cleaned up, but it looked like the girl at the counter was alone.  My sandwich was awesome!  The steam bun really good.  If you are in the neighborhood you must get a Lee's sandwich!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Lee's is part of a California chain and I think the Chandler location is the only one in Arizona.  It is located just across Warner Road from Lee Lee Market so if you are doing some Asian shopping it is a great place to stop by for a quick lunch or pick up a Bahn Mi sandwich to take home.  Cash only prices are very, very reasonable.  I always order the # 14 Asian Sandwich -Pork Roll and Pate on a 10 inch Baguette.  I also always order double meat (extra $ .75) because the meat portions are small and the prices are so reasonable it makes sense to me to go for the extra.  Lee's Baguette's are fresh and crunchy and the Pork Roll and Pate are really tasty.  Each sandwich is made to order so it takes a few minutes to get your order but well worth the wait.  One of my favorite take out places!"}
{"text":"#17 all the way!! I usually get banh mi when I'm in Orange County, but I was craving some when I was staying in Vegas. I came early in the morning the cashier, who was a girl in glasses was extremely rude and had no manners(other workers were polite). Other than that the food was really good :)"}
{"text":"I love the crap out of Lee's. The turkey club with bacon on a huge soft home made croissant cannot be beat for 5 bucks. Seriously. They also give you peppers and a pickle on the side. You can buy an assortment of chips or desserts/pastries to go with your meal.
Don't forget the boba smoothies. (Passion fruit!!) or different coffee drinks. I really wanted to try the Iced Latte..because it looked so good, but I went for the smoothie instead. I love boba.
They also have a selection of different soda's and drinks. Jones and others.
 You can even get gelato.
 I loooove this place!"}
{"text":"I tried the Grilled Chicken sub here today for my first ever visit at any Lee's. I've heard so many positive things about this place, I gotta say though I felt pretty underwhelmed.

The service was good, fast and efficient. The dining area was unique and I did appreciate that.

The sandwich was just okay. The bread was good, but so frickin hard! The chicken was good but drowning under a bunch of onions and carrot shavings(?). Carrot shavings?? okay..

Although the price was reasonable, I really can't see myself going out of my way to come back to Lee's"}
{"text":"Despite the fancy place and clean area, the food simply is not that great. I was in a group of 5 when I came here and I don't think anyone thought it was the best Banh Mi they've ever tasted. I ordered BBQ Pork but the meat was cold and the bread was really hard. 

I was disappointed because it has such a good reputation in CA. I'm pretty sure I'm never coming to this location again."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Their bread is yum, their selection is outstanding and if you want your sandwich done a certain way they get it right!!!  The sandwichs have great taste.  The combination of meat and veggies is just right. I love the cilantro, nice different touch.  Spicy, but not overwhelming.  Only negative is it is a cash only business, but it is so cheap, it is no big deal. So...... BRING CASH!"}
{"text":"Me and my roomate had each had egg and bacon sandwich. Fresh crossant and fresh scrambled egg and bacon. The  cashier said the orange juice was fresh but my roommate said it taste like it was made from a powder. Hmm?"}
{"text":"Lee's sandwich in AZ has very limited selection of snacks. The ice coffee is good though."}
{"text":"I went there not to long ago & I was greeted by a very nice girl, lupe! It is amazingggg! She prepared my smoothie, which was bomb! (: deffinatley go!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are pretty good and very reasonably priced. They come on fresh-baked baguettes. MY favorite is the bbq pork banh mi.  It's a great lunch spot. Their breakfast is also good. Strong coffee is sweetened with condensed milk. It's a great way to start off your morning. 

It's open 24 hours and can be really busy at times.

But just so you know, unless you plan on spending at least $20, you better bring cash. That's their minimum for using plastic."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out for a few months now. I finally walked in one day and walked right out. Nothing looked good. I realized there was no other option that seemed good in the shopping center so I walked back it. It dirt cheap in there. You will know why once you taste the food. The bread was the best part of the sandwich."}
{"text":"Not a good place to eat at all. We ordered 5 shrimp&pork egg rolls(didn't have any flavor at all) chicken wings(HIGHLY SALTED, very processed), Thai tea smoothie, and Bbq pork sandwich. All of our food was not good at all. The manager was extremely rude. I'm very surprised they are still in business. 

I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Aside from the drinks...there is only one reason to come here and that is for the Asian sandwiches...I can eat the grilled pork sandwich every day of my life...don't bother with the European sandwiches or much else...you will likely be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sandwich man scorned...

I am a long time fan of ALL sandwiches. I don't discriminate. I like em big, round, fat, juicy, sometimes dry, but always tasty.  I had this deep dark hunger inside of me when I started my shift this afternoon. After all, I hadn't eaten and working swings your eating clock is way off. I was zooming through yelp looking at sandwich shops in the area for something different than your average Capriotti's, Jason's Deli, Jersey Mikes...You get the picture. 

I want to put this as clear and concise as I can. If there were an award for false advertisement from the picture on the website/menu to the actual sandwiches this place would get hit with the award. I have never honestly been more disappointed in a food purchase. The place had everything going for them too. Fresh lettuce, tomato, croissant, all tasty but only ONE slice of ham, roast beef, and turkey on the #38 Lee's Club.  For a sandwich named after the property to have such a lack of love and meat on it was a disgrace. If this is how they make their signature food for the company I would not purchase or recommend their food or services to anyone."}
{"text":"I just got short change and went back , how ironic that it our fault for not looking at my change. People make sure cashiers don't short change you guy. If you walk away say goodbye to your money."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is quite CONSISTENT. 

Consistent in HORRIBLE service and BLAND Banh Mis.  After numerous attempts, they have failed each and every time.  

But if you insistent - please try them.  Especially if you like:

- Breakfast sandwiches that taste like rubber between two crusty and dry pieces of \"french bread\" - I put that in quotation because I know what french bread (baguettes) should taste and feel like, and this place should be damn ashamed of themselves for claiming they have good european bread.  Please.

- Bottom of the barrel coffee that's thick and tastes like tar and will set you back $4. Coffee that tastes like coal melted down with molasses - yummy!

- Banh Mis that are just shameful.  No flavor, wth?  Lee's should be paddled and punished for this.  

- Service that is excrutiatingly horrible.  Example you ask?  I bought two breakfast sandwiches (#82, bacon ham egg and cheese) for my fiance and I. I open it up and notice there is no bacon and cheese.  I bring it over, and they want to argue with me that there was definitely cheese in it and that I didn't order it with bacon.  Are you freakin' kidding me?  I show the receipt.  I literally pick apart the sandwich to show there's no cheese.  No freakin' cheese or bacon dangit.  Then they tell me that I must have taken it out??  Really??  I walk out.  Screw this.

Never going back.  In fact, I may just stand out and picket this dang joint.  The taste of windy, sandy Vegas winds will taste much better than what they serve."}
{"text":"Love that they are open 24 hours, exceptionally convenient when you are going for a road trip to the mountains. We ordered our tofu banh mi and pork one. I personally, am not a huge fan of the tofu banh mi but my boyfriend seem to like their grill pork. Their cafe sua da was rich and strong! Yummy."}
{"text":"Four stars only because I've only ordered coffee from this location. I'll probably bump it up a star once I actually dine in! It seems like that's the reason for negative reviews here (service), but anyway.. The service, to me, was quick and friendly. The establishment also appeared to be really clean! I wouldn't definitely pass up Starbucks to get coffee from here. The coffee here actually keeps me awake and energized lol"}
{"text":"Love their baguettes! As for their sandwiches, it's alright. They are kinda stingy with the meat so you're getting mostly bread. I wish they would also accept credit cards instead of cash only. I know they have an ATM inside but come on now, seriously?"}
{"text":"I love there cheap vietnamese ice coffee and grilled pork sandwich's. I usually like to stop here before a hike to get my caffeine fix and lunch on the go. 

I like to drink a little ice coffee first and then let the ice melt and then add a little water to make it last. The sandwich's are great for hikes because they preserved nicely with the fresh french bread crispy crust to seal in the juicey meat and pickled vegatables. 

Awe, I wish they still had one in Sac town. I guess I will have to find a closer alternative."}
{"text":"I love the Lee's in my last city with all of my heart. The joy of this Lee's is that it's open 24/7, but stuff just doesn't taste as fresh. 

What's nice is they didn't skimp on anything for my #5, but the bread somehow just misses any of the excitement of fresh bread. 

Thai tea was every bit as good here, but for how much pricier this Lee's is that the one back home, is hope their bread quality could be fresher."}
{"text":"It pains me to give them one star, but like some others on this review site, I had a terrible experience recently due to the staff. Every time I'm able to stop into Lee's I order the Asian Combo with a Chicken Ban mi. While the food has always been good, this last time I actually spent the rest of the afternoon throwing up due to the actions of the staff.

While I was eating in the second booth with my brother, a middle-aged female employee began mopping in the dining area. The mop REEKED!!! I can't even imagine the last time they had cleaned it, because it was just nauseating.  Not only that, she had no bucket of cleaner~ she was literally just pushing around this dirty stinking mop where we were all trying to eat.

As if that wasn't bad enough, she found a dirty spot literally four feet from our table, and her method of cleaning it?? Taking her shoe and rubbing the reeking mop into the spot half-heartedly. She stood there for a good 3 minutes oblivious to the discomfort of the customers trying to eat around that dirty mop. It was so bad I could not finish my food. I threw away at least a third of my sandwich (and later my boba tea) and we left.

After that I felt so nauseated from the smell that I was actually sick at home. It just blows my mind that A) the employee would think such a dirty mop (again, with no cleaner or bucket in sight) would clean the floor adequately and B) that she would be so OBLIVIOUS as to clean with it around eating customers.

I've loved Lee's up until this point, but I'm not sure that I can ever eat there again~ every time I think about it, I'm going to remember that dirty mop and being sick. Poor form, Lee's, very poor form."}
{"text":"Delicious banh mi! This was on our list of places to eat in Vegas. We got there about noon on a Monday and the place was packed. The line was almost out the door. We got 2 sandwiches (thit noung and dac biet) and fried springrolls. The sandwiches were delicious although I prefer how the baguettes are in Atlanta where I live. The fried springrolls were delish as well. If you love Vietnamese coffee, you need to buy their concentrate version. It cost a little more than the one already made but you just need add it to some ice and a little water. you can make 3 or 4 cups with one container of their concentrate. 
Check this place out if you're in Vegas. They're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"I was soooo looking forward to this place opening.  Had heard friends from cali say good things about Lee's... and the thought of banh mi 24 hrs a day had me constantly checking it out every time I drove by, wishing....hoping.... that it would finally open.  Then they finally opened for business and I never went....  lol.  I saw what seemed like a lot of poor reviews on Yelp and just never got around to trying it out.  

Well... leaving my buddy's place late one night and a bit hungry, I finally decided to give them a shot.  Who knows.... maybe it'll be delicious, I thought to myself.  I was thinking a lot of the bad reviews were probably just from the super snobby Yelpers....the ones for whom nothing is ever good enough...lol.  

Well... sad to say, the poor reviews were well earned.  There were 5 people working there that I could see.  Three taking orders by the cash register.... which seemed like overkill, seeing as there were about  10 people in the entire place....half of which were already eating.  1 guy making sandwiches, and 1 guy pretending to push a broom around.  I place my order, as did two other small groups right behind me, and grab a seat right next to the pick-up area.  The guy making sandwiches was pretty quick and had all 3 orders (a total of 6 sandwiches) done in less than 3 minutes.  But then they just sat there on trays.....  while 2 people stood by the cash register doing nothing, and another walked by the finished sandwiches about 5 times so she could talk to the guy sweeping.  

Hmmm...  I wanted to just walk behind the counter and grab the stuff myself... but whatever... I was kinda curious just how long they'd let them sit there.  Eventually the guy who was \"sweeping\" finished up... and as he left the dining area he handed out the 3 completed orders...   So as far as service goes....  not impressed.

But hey, if the sandwiches are amazing... I don't really mind all that much.  Eh, what a let down.  The bread seemed a bit too hard and crunchy.... and although it looked like an adequate amount of meat and veggies were inside...  90% of what I could taste was just bread.  Again....not impressed.  Hue Thai / Mr. Sandwich are much better.  Sure they may be $1 more per sandwich, but it's worth it.  Heck... I'd much rather go get a $5 footlong at Subway then get a couple sandwiches at Lee's.  

You know I really don't like the place when I give it 1 star...  I mean seriously.... I even gave Clark County Detention Center 2 stars."}
{"text":"I was going to give it one star, but since its a clean, nice looking place, i gave it an additional star. 

i was happy and excited to have lee's sandwich finally in vegas. when i was in long beach ca, i use to drive 30-40mins just to have a sandwich at lee's. But lee's here in vegas, i wont even drive 5-10mins to get there.  Its just not lee's. The sandwich just dont have any taste. And like some of the comments before mine, hardly any meat in the sandwiches.

i guess im sticking with the grilled pork at PHO THANH HUONG. The best banh mi sandwiches i had so far in vegas. And its 3 dollars only.


Edit: PHO THANH HUONG  has changed owner/management and i am not a fan of the food anymore."}
{"text":"Lees Sandwiches is one of my favorite places for lunch.   If you try it, be sure to get the BBQ Pork sandwich, and not one of the American sandwiches on the right hand side of the menu.   It's super cheap, fills you up, and is the strangest most wonderful flavor combination.  It's a huge baguette with pickled veges and meat, which tastes waay better than it sounds.  I think my brother said it's French-Vietnamese cuisine, which is a really interesting combo.   Also their spring rolls are light and awesome.

They also have a bunch of bizarre shakes, which are fun to try.  The  Avacado Shake is particularly good."}
{"text":"Cheap Vietnamese sandwiches. The bread is long just like the line to order your food. It took us 50 minutes from the time we entered the restaurant to get our sandwiches and drink order. The sandwiches are good. They just need to staff better. They had one person take orders and he'll pick up the phone for phone orders while everyone else has been waiting for at least 30 minutes just to place an order."}
{"text":"If you're an average white person who might be tired of subway, isn't uncomfortable patronizing an ethnic establishment, and has a little cash and change after popping into to Walgreens then give it a try! Lots of interesting and new flavors! I've had many sandwiches here, and while they might be not as meaty as what you'd expect, they're always delicious. Love the pate' options! Liver spread isn't usually on the menu in most places, but very welcome on my sandwich..."}
{"text":"I was super excited about coming here when I initially walked in. It's colorful, shiny, and so many options. But I found the food very mediocre. 

I got the #1 Lee combo bahn mi. The bread is delicious! Crusty and chewy. But there was too much bread and not enough filling. Very little meat and pickled veggies. Perhaps I'll try the dac biet next time.

I also got a mini chicken pate chaud which was super disappointing. It was 98% puff pastry and 2% meat. The meat was tasty but literally the diameter of a nickel! One tiny tiny bite of chicken.

The iced coffee was free with check in so I feel bad criticizing it. Was good but super sugary. Had to dilute it 4 fold in order to drink it. Definitely worth a try but expect a sugar bomb.

Overall, the taste didn't meet my expectations based on initial impression and rave yelp reviews. But, I haven't given up on Lee's yet and will give it one more shot!

Note: cash only!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the unsatisfied reviews were for, but my first time there last week i was really pleasantly surprised.  Other than Spring Mountain Rd. always being congested as fudge, This Lee's I loved better than LA Lee's.  There was a generous amount of meat, an overload of veggies (which LA Lee's lacks on giving), and lastly...........the bread was SOOOO fresh - lightly crispy and soft at the same time, NO murder on the roof of ur mouth!  The bread was still warm out of the oven, i've never had that from all the other locations.  Everything seriously tasted fresh.  I'm bummed i only ate 1 sammich.  Being preggo right now, i could've totally devoured 2 and taken another one to go on the ride back home.  

I will definitely come back fosho."}
{"text":"Excited to check this place out. Love bahn mi and French macaroons, and in one joint was golden. 
A bit disappointed about the macaroons because they tasted old and had no flavor. Very plain.  
The grilled chicken Bahn mi was ok. The bread was good! But it was lacking flavor and had 3 carrots a small cucumber and one skinny strand of cilantro and a lot of dialing. The spread was good and chicken good too. I just wished they stuffed it more. Maybe I hit a bad day. There was 2 working the registered and I saw 2 in the back. 
Waited about 10 minutes in line, then another 10 for my sandwhich. A little long for a weekday mid morning. 
Like I said I possible hit a bad day, I would give 2 stars but I could tell they felt busy and we're trying to accommodate. I probably would come back and try it again."}
{"text":"If you're in need of a caffeine kick then come to Lee's and try their iced coffee. Its $4.50 for a large and would keep you awake all day! This Lee's location isn't as busy as the one in Chinatown (of course) but its clean and has ample seating. Usually people take their sandwiches to go but I did see some older Asian gentlemen hang out at Lee's. There are some bottled coffee options in the fridge when you first walk in. Its kind of pricey, around $7 for 3 servings. I didn't know how fresh they would be since they're prepackaged so my gf and I opted for 2 Large iced coffees and 2 large triple shot iced coffees. I would compare their large to a venti at starbucks

I asked the cashier what the difference between the regular iced and the triple shot was and she just said the triple shot has 3 shots. When I asked how many shots the regular iced coffee had, she said none. That was surprising to me but then I saw her pour bottled prepackaged/premade coffee into the cups. I never knew Lee's didn't make their coffee fresh! Either way, it tastes good regardless and works well if you need to study or stay awake. I would NOT recommend their triple shot coffee. I think its the regular iced coffee with 3 \"shots of espresso\" (I'm sure its also prepackaged/bottled). Its super thick, and extremely sweet, even with the ice all melted."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the fresh baguette bread they make daily.. Great grab a sandwich and go eat in a park. I will say it is a little bit expensive but I guess you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Don't have enough words to carry on about how thrilled I am this is in AZ and how yummy yummy everything I've had here has been. If I were fluent in Vietnamese as well as English I still doubt I'd have enough to say.

So let me go for brevity: This place flippin' rocks. And they don't take American Express. Or any other card for that matter. BRING CASH."}
{"text":"Not bad for a Vietnamese 24 hour fast food restaurant. I have had better ban mi but not for the price and for the hours they operate. Their iced coffee is really good and if I'm in the area I would order here again"}
{"text":"Stopped coming because of the sketchy people that walk inside and ask for money. Had enough of that."}
{"text":"Decided to get smoothies at Lee's Sandwich with my cousin. I got the small Strawberry Smoothie with boba. The smoothie here tasted alright, but I tasted better somewhere."}
{"text":"Im writing this as a i nibble on my banh mi dac biet that I bought a couple hours back. It is still as good even when it's left out in room temperature. try their pork wrapped around a croissant type breading and croissant sandwiches with PATE!"}
{"text":"Very clean place with great customer service. Love their Asian desserts. The cashier Hector was friendly and didn't hesitate to answer any questions we had. Kudos! I hope they have an Asian supermarket next in Henderson. We ordered 2 smoothies and get another one free. The kiwi, avocado & Thai tea smoothies were delicious. Love the fact that they have baguettes ready every 30 mins. Hot & Crunchy. The baguettes reminds me of my hometown's supermarket bakery then called Yokoso in Singapore. We will be there again soon. Yay!"}
{"text":"Granted it may be a smaller newer location, give em a chance to figure out how much inventory they need. The place is convenient for me on the west side and my sand which was BOMB."}
{"text":"I waited in a long line to order my food only to be told they take cash only.  No credit cards and no debit cards. 

These people have no customer service skills and they can't adapt to they way we do things over here. 

I'll never go there again.   A terrible customer service experience."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, craving creators, once or twice a taster, 3rd time and forevermore a craver! You'll get hooked for sure on the dynamic selection if Lee's creative sandwiches, among all the other varied and awesome treats there are to sample, delicious salads, deserts, the fresh bread is outstanding and a most have to go. Fell in love with my regular favorites...then had to move to Ca...never fear...FOUND LEE'S HERE! San Jose, Ca. Right in downtown bumped into Lee's and not to be disappointed...all my favorites were right here just the same...gotta love the consistency.Love that Lee's fresh bread!"}
{"text":"Warm fresh baked bread....The Best"}
{"text":"Liked
- open 24/7
- BBQ pork sandwich (the # 6)
- quick service for the morning
- bread

So so
- no one making my sandwich was Vietnamese and definitely not Lee

Still sandwich was good for the price."}
{"text":"1) For the overall Lee's chain, I'm a big fan. Love the sandwich quality, taste and portion size
2) For this specific Lee's branch, I'm a fan. Large dining space. Clean. Plenty of area to check out the other products for sale (snacks, drinks). TVs and wifi available. Staff is courteous and wants customers to not wait that long. I usually get the #11 Special Combination or #1 Combination Asian sandwiches - both on which I consider to be one of the best bahn mi's I've ever had, despite it coming out of a chain restaurant. 

Remember to use the Epoxy app for their loyalty system. Buy 10 sandwiches, get 1 free.  I'd rather stick to the old card because the app is a little clumsy."}
{"text":"Had a sandwich from here and honestly I've had better from the grocery store. You know those premade sandwiches that are just wrapped in plastic wrap. 
The bread is super hard so I just ate the cheese meat and veggies on the inside. This place ain't worth your time."}
{"text":"The fresh bread is wonderful. The smell alone makes your mouth water. The sandwiches are cheap and very satisfying."}
{"text":"We went there today and from the wait in line and by the time we got our food it was a hr and a half. They didn't have a lot of things that we wanted that the chandler store serve. I will not be coming here again. I live in goodyear and I rather drive to chandler from now. They didn't have the steam pork buns and spring rolls.  I waited 45 mins to get my food after I ordered up front. We got the sandwiches but they were dry. The building is very small and no space inside and to move around. They should of bought a bigger building."}
{"text":"These are the best Sandwiches in town! The French baguettes are absolutely perfect, they make the best sandwich around.

The combination of flavors makes for a tasty sandwich. I love how they put a whole bunch of fresh jalapeno's, which I usually pick of all but a few. I enjoy the bite.

You cannot beat the prices, $3-$5 for a fresh sandwich and the best French Baguettes or croissants if you prefer! Although there sodas are small and expensive, around $1.75 especially compared to $1 for a large at other places. 

But don't forget their huge selection of Boba's and Flavored drinks, there is truly something for everyone! Taro is my fav!

Mostly I love the convenience of being able to grab my sandwich and head back to work to eat at my desk!"}
{"text":"This place is in Chinatown right around the corner from where I live. I was getting my nails done down at Sahara when the guy who does my nails got into a conversation about Chinatown and all the spots he likes he mentioned this place and he said they had the best ice coffee. When someone tells me something is a 10 I know I have to investigate! So after getting my nails done my boyfriend and I go he orders a smoothie and order a large ice coffee. Coffee was a 10 it had crushed ice and the coffee was rich and thick. I want to try the steamed bun next time and a baguette. Will be coming back to Lees sandwiches."}
{"text":"****** Horrible Banh Mi ********
The only reason this gets 2 stars is bc it could pass as a strip club late night with the neon lights.

Definitely the nicest looking Lee's but the food doesnt even come close to matching up.

The bread needs to be baked a little more and the meat are really bad quality. I got the grilled pork and it was the worst ive ever had."}
{"text":"Best Bahn Mi's in Las Vegas! Whenever I am in town this is a MUST! I love the #5 - Grilled Pork Bahn Mi."}
{"text":"Got the #25 turkey club with American cheddar cheese. This sandwich never fails! :)  The sandwich was very good! It had more than enough ingredients which made the sandwich look delish but it was delish. I still need to come back and try some other kind of sandwich since I always order the turkey one. Nothing beats Lees sandwiches :)"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of banh-mi sandwiches; and Lee's Sandwiches (this is a franchise - I've been to the one in Garden Grove, CA) is a good place to get them! :) We randomly came across this place while we were in Vegas. After dinner - we were driving through some strip malls hoping to find another eatery to try some Chinese/Japanese food. However, it was already 11 pm and most places/restaurants had closed.

EXCEPT...Lee's! It was the only place that was open in its strip mall / plaza, so we walked in and purchased some sandwiches to go. :) It was a good stop for us, since we were going to drive to Grand Canyon the next day, so buying some sandwiches for the road made sense.

We ordered:
Combination - yummy, 2 types of meat slices
Pork roll & pate - I'm a fan of pate, so I really liked this sandwich the best
Grilled pork - reddish color pork slices
Special combination - 3 types of meat, instead of 2 types in the regular combination
Roast beef - \"american style\" roast beef sandwich; my husband ordered this one

Every sandwich comes with some fermented/preserved orange/white carrots + some cilantro and slices of jalapeño. YUM! :)

There was a promotion at the time too: 
Buy 5, get 1 FREE! We took advantage of that - the cash register lady told us about it when we were ordering.

We had to wait about 10-15 min for them to make our sandwiches and then off we went.

This place is OPEN 24 HOURS!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, but what gives it 5 stars is the strong, tasty, infamous, Lee's iced coffee"}
{"text":"The only good employee is the seemingly one female that works here. The rest either give you 3/4 cup of your drink, get your order wrong and refuse to make up for it. For example giving you a medium when you ordered a large, then all they do is put the drink from the medium cup into the larger cup without topping it off. One specific guy always hovers over you as you pay feeling entitled to his tip for literally pressing a button on a dispenser for your iced coffee. 

The female employee would make my drinks properly. Most of the guys are skimpy, they try to be sneaky and jip you. these are no accidents. 

Sometimes your sandwich will have a thin sliver of meat. consider your Bahn Mi to be pickled veggie sandwiches. still tasty, but almost no meat."}
{"text":"This place is pretty pricey. I had a reg strawberry smoothie and it costs an extra 40 cents to get boba. A large was over $4. The taste was ok but it was made sloppy, kinda watery. Had better from hawaii. My moms durian was good though, but I don't like the inconsistency. All products should be made equally well. Workers are friendly enough.  Don't think is worth the hype."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service and quality of their coffee. They messed up my order and when I finally got my coffee still  not what I asked for.  I asked for black coffee no sugar nothing difficult.  People who work there only speak Spanish and very little English."}
{"text":"I came in and ordered a LARGE iced coffee with light ice. However, when I got my drink, it was filled halfway and still had a lot of ice. Basically, I paid 5 bucks for a small coffee. If I wanted a small, I would have ordered a small. Complete rip off."}
{"text":"Let's see... First off I only brought the sandwich to come back to my hotel and put it in the oven for the next morning for breakfast. I must say, they're slacking on the meat. So I was kind of disappointed, but it's ok, because it was still good to me. Reasonably priced, unlike Pho next door obviously. I also order the Ice Coffee Mocha. And oh my, its strong. Deliciously strong, that's how they usually are so I can't complain. Loved how it's 24 hours, and it was clean for sure. So it's not a big deal to me."}
{"text":"Their extra fresh and warm baguettes would make a shoe string and boot sole sandwich taste wonderful!   Everything tastes great on one of these sandwiches, and hence you can't go too wrong with whatever type you choose.  I like to get them takeout and at home add extra mayo, mustard and some cheese or ham  that I have in the fridge.  We like their club sandwich (#38) that never needs any additions, made on a fresh croissant and overloaded with great sandwich ingredients!  I don't mind  the  two springs of cilantro, two slices of Jalapeno as I pick them out and add them to my wife's sandwich.
I you are a sandwich lover, you will appreciate their flavor despite not being stuffed.  With the takeout I get to put my signature on it!  I also bring home some bread for my freezer. Bring cash."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in town....very clean and vibrant vegetables. Flavors are amaze balls!!!! Open 24 hours? Fuck yes they are!!!!...i want a sandwich at 3 am after a heavy masturbation session....done!!!! God bless this shop."}
{"text":"What are you all talking about?! This place is awful. Theres a reason why these sandwiches are $3. I can't believe so many people like this place, (although the place was filled with the Chinese people and they have been known to have different taste buds ) You get a 10 inch piece of bread with a bunch of stringy cheap vegetables. From what they said, there was meat on there too,  however i forgot to bring my microscope to verify if there was any on there. This place is like a middle school cafeteria smack dab in the heart of Tokyo's slums (i don't know any Vietnamese cities). Please, homeless people, save your quarters, you're too good for this place. They have good milkshakes, but if you really are homeless (as you should be if you're going to Lee's) you shouldn't be buying \"rich people\" milk shakes anyways, stick with the dollar menu."}
{"text":"I make a trip to the atm just to come to Lee's. You have to eat the bread fresh. Period. It doesn't help any that they come in a paper sleeve...

Secret: Buy in bulk, cut into pieces, and store in ziploc bags. Then, just nuke em for a few second. Good as new.

Enough with the bread. The iced coffee is ridiculous. It is pure espresso and cream. So sweet and strong. Dear lord I love it.

The sandwiches are good. Boyfriend loves the \"croissant\" side of the menu for the white folks. I'll eat anything, but I do like the bbq pork and grilled chicken sandwiches best. 

While you're over there, head to LeeLee supermarket and buy a live crab, some rice noodles, or whatever Asian goodies your heart desires."}
{"text":"I took vacation in LA. The first time I came here. I ordered pork meat ball (xiu mai) and my husband ordered vegetarian ( banh mi chay). And I got meat cut box. We went to there at 1am. The bread is so tough, no crispy, seem like they gave to us the old one from the morning. And something white colour be weird inside my husband's ordered. No cucumber. No onions like they advertised and not the same with beautiful pictures on the wall. and we did not know what that is exactly. The meatballs are too sweet to me with A lot sugar. And the most terrible \"meat cut in the box\", which ruined my vacation night really. I asked the lady how long have been taken until now. She said just yesterday. But everything was smell and stickiness inside. Its cost 4.31$. I tried to eat some, and its nasty. I must vomit after some slides of something stickiness like shit. And my stomatch was stomach ache then. Im really frustrated with meat cut in the box. I throwed all away in trash. I promise I never back this place. The first time is the same as the last time. It ruined my weekend night already"}
{"text":"Why am I not impressed?  People rave about Lee's sandwiches from LA so I thought I'd give it try here in Vegas.  It's nothing spectacular.  I ordered  the grilled pork (#5)...I've had better."}
{"text":"This is a great place for great baguettes! I like their Vietnamese sandwiches but there are a lot of different meats to try! I also like all the drink options. Unfortunately they were out of Thai tea, but this is the first time that's ever happened. The workers are pleasant and the place is clean! The bathrooms are clean too!"}
{"text":"I come here for the fresh sugar cane juice and bahn mi sandwiches.  Their coffee drinks are really good as well.  You can get a variety of things to eat here, the prices are very affordable and you get your moneys worth.  I highly recommend visiting."}
{"text":"I don't know too many places were you can spend $3 and get a really good quality sandwich. The bbq pork is my favorite. Great Sandwich , also the baguettes are the best around, I grab a few before dinner sometimes and they are a hit everytime"}
{"text":"Drove across town cause it says it closes at 9:30.. Its 9:11 and the people wouldn't let us in."}
{"text":"I got a large iced coffee and asked for less ice so I get my drink and it's halfway filled with some ice and coffee......so basically I paid 4.95 for a cup of ice. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Wow this place is Asia-tastic.

Looks like a cafeteria you'd find in any major Asian city. Any way. The food was aiiight. Vietnamese sandwiches are naturally cheap. Was pretty regular. We also got the cream puffs because we felt like a dessert. IT SUCKED. Save your money.

Just drop by this place for a quick grab and go."}
{"text":"This was the most crowded Lee's that I have ever been to! It was crazy busy on a Saturday morning and there must have been 10 people in line ahead of us. I didn't realize banh mi was an acceptable breakfast food, but I'd rather have that than an egg mcmuffin any day.

I don't know why this place has bad reviews. Yeah, Lee's doesn't have the best banh mi ever, but it's acceptable. A special combination fueled my three and a half hour drive home! This particular location is huge and they have a lot of different things like sandwich combinations, bun noodles and fresh sugar cane juice. They also sell a variety of packaged asian snacks and even a Lee's vietnamese coffee maker!"}
{"text":"This place has a great bakery for Asian bread type items or Banh Mi as my friend Jando insists upon :) 

Plus they do very good sandwiches at good prices. The sandwiches are mainly Asian style but also has just standard turkey, ham etc. on fresh rolls and croissants.

All types of drinks, juices, boba teas and smoothies.

My favorite thing is the fresh squeezed sugar cane juice. On this visit it was perfect. I got a hollow donut it was hot and fresh. Not really a donut but more like a lightly sweetened bread exterior with almost no bread inside. Whatever

Staff was friendly as usual and it came out pretty quick. I love the automated voice telling you your order number is ready. It's cool and creepy cuz it's almost movie voice and you're being called in. kinda weird but go get something and wait for your order and you'll think...hmmm this is weird but it's all really good.

The only knock was the seating and table area wasn't clean as it normally is. It was in rough shape.

Takes this 5 star trip at Lees today to 4 star. 

Of course I'll be back cuz I like the consistency of the food, people and free wifi."}
{"text":"Always good. Fresh baguettes and croissants make the sandwiches over the top. Great bakery item's, coffee drinks, smoothies."}
{"text":"Coffee and smoothie tasted great. Service was friendly. They even gave us a free baguette which went great with their pate."}
{"text":"Great staff, friendly and attentive, owner came out and chatted with us and others. Decent bahn mi, bbq pork tasted good but I wish there was more of it, maybe twice as much for the price, quite a bit higher than I'm used to paying. Kids enjoyed churros and chips. Wife had the club and liked it but thought it was pretty basic, decent price though. The baguettes were awesome, crunchy and delicious. All in all not a bad spot. I did miss the pate on my sandwich though I guess thats not how they serve it there, oh well."}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches but the staff are a bit rude.  The first time I was there, I was ordering a sandwich and then saw some egg rolls and the sesame ball, she said under her breath, \"I better ring you up before you add anything else\".  Like who says that?  I'm buying from you and the more I buy the more revenue you all get.  So bizarre.

Second time I went we forgot to tell the cashier we wanted the Asian combo at the beginning and instead mentioned it in the middle and he said \"you need to tell le they are combos at the beginning of the order\".  Like... really?

The only sandwiches worth getting is the combo and the pork.  The chicken isn't good.  The egg rolls are nice and so are the sesame balls."}
{"text":"I have only tried the Chinese Barbecue pork sandwich with fresh french bread made on location. It is so good I can't get myself to try anything else. The price is $2.60 but you better bring cash as they do not take plastic. You can buy a baguette for just $1.00 and there was a steady stream of patrons doing just that. I agree with some of the reviews that the toppings could be larger but still a great value for the price."}
{"text":"This time that I went, their tables and floor were immaculate. I ordered the Special Combination sandwich and asked them to put it in a croissant instead of a baguette. Their croissants are so soft and fresh. Filling was pretty plentiful and I got a side of paté and it was a decent amount this time. Their coffee is still full of ice, but it's so delicious and I got a free one because I had a coupon that I saw inside the Las Vegas Weekly in the dining section.

My ten or more two star experiences and this five star bring me to a three star for Lee's. Their wifi is always open. I guess there won't be much they can do now about the lack of outlets, but there's always great reception.

I will be back to see because I have an inkling that this place may slowly go back up in rating. I'm glad they listened to the words of the wise Yelpers."}
{"text":"I would have to give a 3 star only because I am from cali & the sandwiches out there seem to be way BETTER. It also seems like the prices are a lot higher but maybe it is because they are 24 hours so they need to cover the costs in some ways especially with such a big space. 

I have never really seen this place packed like the locations in California, but service is fast & easy... they take your order quick & try to get your food out as quick as possible. 

I usually always get wings from here... although it takes about 10min. For them to cook it... totally worth the wait for the hot steaming wings hahaha

The sandwiches seems to lack the amount of meat & more so veggies than what I feel is the norm for them... compared to California I feel like i can count how many pieces of veggies are in my sandwich compared to the ones I usually get that has veggies over flowing & falling out while eating your sandwich. This may be the main reason as to why my star rating is 3 stars.

But i do LOVE all the random snacks that they have... along with their smoothies which I think is pretty good & their Vietnamese ice coffee with crushed ice is the BEST especially if you are a student & you just need that pick me up.

The interior is nice though... very clean... although the bathrooms do have some sort of stench but i try to not use them unless in dyer need."}
{"text":"We ordered lunch for a coworkers birthday and we were kinda disappointed. The sandwhiches were very dry and had little meat and veggies on the inside. I had a Vietnamese coffee which was delicious though."}
{"text":"They never disappoint whichever location i go to. But what I like about this location is that it's huge! Plenty of seating.. not crowded (went around 10 pm on a Sunday night). Not a lot of workers at this time so cashier wasn't there waiting for customers.. but it was fine. After they noticed us we placed our orders and looked around the big selection of Vietnamese snacks and such. The workers seemed nice."}
{"text":"Talk about rip off!!! This location charges at least $1.25 more per item than other locations. $4 bucks for a sandwhich that usually cost $2.75 elsewhere. You can get Banh Bao for $1.25 in orange county and ( buy 2 get one free ). Not here!!! It's $2.50 each and no freebies. Over priced and horrible service."}
{"text":"This is my fast food option if I want some bahn mi. I feel like it's rushed and not authentic. I go there if I'm on a thirty minute lunch and can't wait for a real sandwhich. Some of the meat is processed and they don't have that homey vibe when I walk in."}
{"text":"Bread is always nice and fresh! Sandwiches are very consistent which is great. I'm very happy there's one in this area now"}
{"text":"Lee's is one of the best places for sandwiches and bahn bao (steamed buns) in Las Vegas. Vietnamese food in general is an acquired taste, and you must also apply this to these sandwiches. With that said, the food here is amazing and has such a unique taste. The sandwiches are a pretty decent size and you are rarely left hungry after just one. The employees are always extremely nice and helpful if you don't fully understand what you are ordering. While the line can get pretty long (because it's popular), once you have ordered it is a fairly short wait. Furthermore, Lee's is open 24hrs, so you can get your cultural grub on any time of the day. I usually eat here about once a week. My favorite thing on the menu is the bahn bao (steamed buns). These are amazing. I typically get the pork and egg or the BBQ, however, they also offer a chicken, egg, and mushroom bun. I highly recommend eating here. If you are skeptical give it shot. Definitely get a bun and maybe split a sandwich with someone to give it a taste. I hope you love it just as much I do."}
{"text":"Please do not support this business! I am horrified and angry about how I was treated! The customer service by far has been my worst that I have experienced. It is also unorganized when it comes to the card system. One of the workers (dont know her name but she was latina) swiped my card for my meal at $5.99. She brought back the receipt and the receipt said $16.48. Good thing I saw it before I signed my name! I told her that my meal simply only cost $5.99 instead of $16.48. While she went back into the card machine to see if an error occurred, my friends approached me from behind. I told them about the problem. I exclaimed \"I hope she isnt swiping my card a lot of times!\" The worker says this to me \"You need to stop talking shit with your friends, im not fucking swiping your card twice!\" In shock I reply, \"What horrible customer service, its you're job to treat me with respect, how dare you talk to me like that!\" she replied \"if you dont like it, you can leave!\" Not only was I embarrassed in front of everyone but I was humiliated. I have been going to Lees Sandwhiches for years now! I even told my friends! But being treated like shit ended it. I am forever done with this restaurant. I will tell everyone that I know that this customer service was not acceptable. I later on checked my bank account and I was charged twice! I had to call bank of america immediately and clear up everything! 

PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!

HORRIBLE SERVICE. LOWSEY CUSTOMER SERVICE.

PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!

There is a cheaper and better viet sandwhich place down the next plaazas. WITH BETTER SERVICE.

Dont waste your time and HARD EARNED MONEY!"}
{"text":"The place is alright, not all that. Didn't try much of their food. I only got the steam chicken and pork buns. Bad parking and not many space."}
{"text":"Great sandwich if made to order, when done right there great but getting it right is a challenge. Sometimes jalapeños sometime not,"}
{"text":"They have the best sandwich if u get what u order I have been going there 3 times a week and it's been nice but lately sandwich's been made wrong and managers want make it right very poor customer service but again when made right it's the best"}
{"text":"The tuna & almond baguette sandwich is ahhhhmazing! First time here and that is what I had, so fresh & yummy"}
{"text":"There are a few amazing things about Lee's Sandwiches that needs to be pointed out:

1. 24 hours. 7 days a week. 365 days a year. All day, errrrday, baby! When the UNLV library closes at midnight and the 24 hour Starbucks joints are all full during midterms, Lee's is a great alternative as a study spot. 

2. Iced coffee. A little disappointing because it's literally a cup of ice with a side of coffee. But no joke, this stuff is super potent. Ice will melt over time and the coffee will still stay strong and won't taste watered down. Condensed milk goes into this so for ya'll lactose intolerant people, pop a Lactaid pill or avoid it altogether. 

3. Snacks. They have a good variety of Asian snacks. Sweet, salty, crunchy, candy-like...you name it, they have it. They're a little hard to ignore since they're staring at you while you're waiting in line to pay. 

I was a huge fan of their sandwiches when they first opened. Bread was always warm and soft. Ample amount of meat and veggies. But sad to say, it's no longer like this. The last sandwich I ordered, I felt as though I was fighting with the bread just to get a good bite. Hard, stiff, stale bread ain't my thing. I ordered the veggie sandwich and it got me scratching my head wondering where all the veggies were! I usually really like their pork and egg steamed buns too, but wasn't too appetizing during the last visit. More bun, less pork/egg concoction.

All in all, I would recommend this place. They need to bring back good quality sandwiches though. Then this place would be fantastic."}
{"text":"I love coming here when I am in town.  I think the sandwiches are delisous and fairly inexpensive.  The bread is crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside.  After all it is  a bakery.  
I am now hooked on the honeydew boba.  So fun to drink.  Once the boba settles and gets cold it is hard to pull them up in the straw but thats whats fun."}
{"text":"Service seem slow compared to the other chains I've been to on the west coast. They had only one person taking orders. The outside building logo advertise as if they had slot machines inside I did not see any slot machines only thing close to a slot machine I saw was the cash register 

Iced coffee is always good here. This particular location offered hollowed donuts with sesame seed. It was surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"While a good value and alright in taste, this place doesn't come close to the mom and pops in Westminster, CA. I think the bread here is just so so which is surprising since its made on site. After having so many banh mi sandwiches in other places this is definitely the \"Subway\" of Asian sandwiches. There are also a few other places around the valley that for me are a bit more tasty and just as cheap.. Da Vang on the west side as well as Viet My Deli.. the later make bread on site as well, plus both are local family owned.. 

Now gimme some of that pork skin, this bear is hungry!"}
{"text":"Great croissant sandwiches!

They make the bread fresh here and the food is really good and a great price!

Bathrooms are pretty clean and the place is nicely laid out. 

The only complaint I have is that the whole one you are eating you here \"#21,22,23 your order is ready\" over and over until you want to lose your mind... I would think the number on display would be good enough or they could just give a number for the table and have it dropped to people..."}
{"text":"Hands down, besides having awesome Bahn Mi sandwiches, they also make a mean tasting baguette. As a matter of fact,  a few days ago when I was there to pick up our favorite bbq'd pork Bahn Mi, I felt obligated to buy a baguette that was piping hot out of the oven. So, because I live 30 minutes away, I started to pick at the baguette top while driving. It was hot and the bread was just perfect on it's own. Well, 15 minutes into driving, I realized I ate half the baguette. Feeling guilty, I put it away so I couldn't reach it while driving. Lesson learned,  hot Lee's baguettes and driving do not go hand in hand.

In any case, Lee's sandwiches is consistent and makes a great, cheap meal. The people watching isn't half bad either if you eat within. Their boba drinks are sometimes not thick enough and the eggrolls sometimes seem overcooked (maybe because they sit under the heat lamp)..but all in all, Lee's is one of my favorite go-to spots when I'm feeling the Bahn Mi craving.."}
{"text":"Chicken egg rolls, churros and lychee bobs smoothie were awesome.  Definitely coming back to try more of their dishes.   The store has a bunch of prepackaged snacks and treats to purchase also.  It's open 24/7 and had a lot of seating available."}
{"text":"Bahn mi (asian sandwich) is very good. I tried the chicken bahn mi, the grilled pork bahn mi (favorite) & the BBQ pork bahn mi. We get the combo which is $5.99 for the bahn mi, 2 egg rolls & a 16 oz soda. Their European sandwiches look really good too. I am absolutely a fan. Especially because they're open 24 hours & they have a frozen yogurt bar (it's more like an icee, though). This is a new favorite place for us in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I really like the quality of ingredients they use on their sandwiches especially the ham. And the baguette bread they use is one of the best breads I ever had however they use romaine instead of lettuce which to  me ruins the sandwich. A close by competitor gives you a choice as to what kind you want on your sandwich, maybe Lee's can do the same."}
{"text":"what's not to like? seriously? the awesome snacks? the great food? the steamed buns? the awesome iced coffee (don't drink their bottled ice coffee straight, it must be cut down with water, lots of ice or milk, at least 3 servings)"}
{"text":"I go to this Lee's all the time for the coffee, but that's about all they do right. Last time I went they screwed up my order when I requested a fresh baguette and sesame balls I asked for them to be made fresh and hot and everything was cold and not fresh at all.  I went again today to give it another try and got the bacon ham egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on a baguette and again it was just like warm, no ham and it was only halfway full. Very disappointing when this location used to be great! Go to another location because they do not care about quality."}
{"text":"Meh.  Not really impressed.  I was really excited after I read some of the reviews online and left a little dissapointed.

The place is super affordable but the ambiance and food quality leaves a bit to be desired.  The sandwhich I had was light on ingredients and for some reason quite onion-heavy.  I can't see myself coming back."}
{"text":"I don't see why this place gets such great reviews... maybe because it is cheap?

The food is OK, not great and they don't give you much inside the bread."}
{"text":"Getting our Monday night Ham & Cheese croissant, and iced coffee! Stop here every time we make an airport run."}
{"text":"Always inconsistent with their regular & large sized coffee \"measurements\".  Really this is considered a size large? I don't like my coffee watered down with the mound of ice that was given, but this is really skimping out on the caffeine crave. SMH"}
{"text":"When there is a Lee's in your city, that is a good indication Viet community ain't too shabby size wise. For growing numbers of Viets relocating to Las Vegas from Cali, this is for now, the only Lee's operating in the city of sin.

And for what it's worth, the location of the world's largest banh mi franchise doesn't bite the sour bullet the same way so many of the others do. The sandwiches are solid, but not enough to be considered legendary on their own. Sure, it's factory produced with the bread baked in house, but like many chain'y executions, the food lacks the love and subtle touches other local banh mi joints would otherwise put out. The dac biet (special) version of their Viet sammy may be their most reliable sandwich, even if the bread is a tad often too crunchy for the already bloody roof of my mouth.

When all else fails, shoot for a Viet coffee or one of their cold beverages. Vegas is already hot as hell during the summer, so their iced coffee actually does hit the spot. While it's tempting (and always available), don't give too much thought to their random snacks (goi cuon, cha lua, etc.). You'll likely find better at the Viet supermarkets or local delis, but expect a price inflated version at Lee's.

Got the munchies at 3AM? You're in luck, this Lee's, much like the rest of their neighbors on Spring Mountain are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Drunkards are less likely to come here from the strip from a cab, so expect a crowd of locals or Asian food craving zombies to source the late night scene."}
{"text":"Ah, no sandwich can compare to a Lee's sandwich. This has been my favorite sandwich place for as long as I can remember. My favorites include anything off the breakfast or European sandwich menu. I love the wide variety of drinks and other food items that you can look at when standing in line. I think it's so cool to watch the bread being baked (BTW, loaves come out fresh every 30 minutes) The cashiers are wonderful, and make an effort to know us by name. The prices are very affordable. They only take cash. The service is always fast even when the place is completely packed. Also, Lee's is centrally located. I love this place, and I would recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Nothing to spectacular.  chicken sandwich was ok, not to flavorful. Only good thing was the bread was fresh and crispy. Also ordered a papaya boba tea. It was too sweet and the boba were not fresh but frozen. Wouldn't recommend to go here."}
{"text":"As a Bay Area native, to find Lee's sandwiches here in my neck of the woods was a wonderful surprise!

I've been eating less to no meat these days, but was craving a Viet sandwich because I especially love eating fresh French bread (rolls, baguettes, crosissants). The layering of complex, bold flavors Viet sandwiches are known for- savory, sweet, spicy, with an herby (cilantro) hint- makes their sandwiches better than the average. 

When I walked in, I asked the cashier (I think her name is Jezlynn) about her thoughts on the veggie sandwich. She said that it's really good and has fried tofu,  vermicelli, and onions in lieu of meat. She also mentioned that it comes with a veggie sauce, but since I asked for mayo (it doesn't come with it), she suggested that I get the flavorful veggie sauce on the side. Jezlynn was 100% correct! I enjoyed my sandwich like a French Dip w Au Jus (except it was a Veggie Sandwich w Veggie Au Jus).

Thank you for your thorough description and suggestions. Your customer service is excellent. Wish more places hired employees like you!"}
{"text":"Sooo this place has great prices and amazing sandwiches no complaints here if you come order a number 5 sweet jesus"}
{"text":"Great Value for the price. But the sandwiches are lacking something and I know what it is. You get a lot of fresh baked bread but wheres the meat? 

I usually get the bbq pork or the grilled chicken and each time they seem to be stingy with the meat. The sandwiches here are just bland and consistency isn't there. I was surprised when I tried the tuna almond with Asian vegetables it was tasty. I would love to try the locations in California maybe i'll have a change of heart or maybe its just this location.  

Next time I have a Bahn mi craving i'll be going to a spot across the street."}
{"text":"Wonderful Vietnamese sandwich shoppe. Their baguettes are great hot out of the oven with butter or in one of their many sandwich choices. They have a modest selection of baked goods along with some of the best egg rolls around. Bring cash or your ATM card as no credit cards are accepted but they have an ATM on premises."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed tonight! My baguette was a little soggy and the cafe sua da was definitely not the same. Let's hope these kinks get worked out in due time because I know a lot of us have been waiting for Vegas to get a Lee's for a long time now."}
{"text":"I love Lee's sandwiches... especially their breakfast egg and cheese croissant.  SO GOOD.  And I've noticed the quality of the croissant at this location is Way better than the ones I've had in California....  This location is 24 hours and you can order breakfast any time!!!!

I enjoy the:

Breakfast Egg & Cheese Croissant
Any Croissant sandwich, with swiss cheese
BBQ chicken Asian Sandwich
Iced Coffee
Iced Americano Latte
Some locations have a rice noodle bowl with meats and egg rolls and fish sauce.. i like that too"}
{"text":"We love his place BUT over time, their sandwiches have gotten more expensive and skimpier. I posted a photo of how the sandwich they serve is actually worth 1/2 sandwich because there isn't much in it! They need to charge less if they are going to do that."}
{"text":"Cheap sandwiches but they're pretty whatever. I got the BBQ pork, which had pickled veggies that was a nice contrast to the pork. But other than that there wasn't much flavor. I love that the combination sandwich (#1) had pate as spread."}
{"text":"They are always out of lemon grass beef and shredded pork!!!  I tried the grilled pork and it was so good!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see that there was a location near my home but after visiting it... Not anymore. Ordered 1 reg coffee and 1 mocha. Girl behind us ordered 1 reg coffee. She got hers first. Wouldn't our order be made first? Guess not. Walking out, my friend accidentally spilled his coffee everywhere inside the restaurant. He didn't even get to put his straw in it. They wouldn't comp us a new drink even though he didn't get to drink it. He ended up buying a new one. Almost $4 for a whole new drink and it costs you probably less than 50c to make. I get that it's your store policy or whatever but it's bad customer service. And it makes you look cheap. Greedy and unsympathetic management."}
{"text":"Went in at 6:50 pm. Had a lot of workers milling around the register. Started to order a sandwich but was told that they were out of bread and that it would be at least a 40 minute wait. It was kind of bizarre but they were smiling like it was a really funny thing? 

Went to Banh MI Bistro on Bell instead. 

I would give this place a couple months or so for them to get a hang of it. I didn't notice the prices since I left so quick but if it's pricier and less quality than their Chandler counterpart as the other reviews have mentioned, I see no reason to come here.

So overall the place is really small and the employees are not as efficient and professional as you would expect if you frequented the Chandler location."}
{"text":"I love this place. I wished it was closer to where I live. I also wished it was near my work so I can eat here everyday. 

Simple and cheap. It's a quick meal. Banh mi with the original French chewy baguette rolls and classic spreads. There can be more filling to be honest, but it's still very good and it's a sizeable meal. Most people can't handle the raw jalapeño slices, so don't forget to pick those out if you're one of them. 

Iced drinks are good, especially the iced coffee but sometimes it's too much ice. Try the sugarcane juice if you never had it before. Very sweet and refreshing. 

You get your sandwich and go. There's no fancy service. All the banh mi are under $4. 
It's a big store and there's a lot of seating. The repeating automated voice calling out numbers might get annoying but I tune it out. 

It's so Asian here. The decor and the foods and the service and the products... But all sorts come in, it's great.

Note: don't leave the banh mi in your car and forget about it. It will stink up your car like no other. Probably due to the pickled vegs."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to get Vietnamese sandwiches.  Always fresh to order and ready in minutes.  Plenty of different sandwiches to choose from. Many different toppings to add. If you'd like save your sandwich to eat another day you could always ask your server to put the toppings on the side.    Not only do they serve sandwiches, they also serve different types of desserts and snacks.  And they're open late."}
{"text":"Food and service here was ok compared to other Lee's locations.  Asked for the baguette to be toasted prior to making the sandwich...it was chewy and slightly warm - as if they had stuck it in the microwave."}
{"text":"First time eating at Lee's...however, after being up all night with nausea, I'm pretty sure it'll be my last.

I got #5, my girlfriend got #6. We both shared our sandwiches and lo and behold, she wasn't feeling too good last night either. When we came in and were the only people there for the majority of the time, it should have been a sign that we should have went elsewhere because honestly the sandwiches did not taste very good at all. The pork on mine was wayyyy too fatty and just didn't taste right, and hers was just blah. Overall we both agreed that the sandwiches sucked. The egg rolls weren't that bad but its really hard to mess up egg rolls.

I also had vietnamese coffee after we ate, and that was pretty good... just coffee and condensed milk so not really much to it.

The service was ok... The girl at the register didn't seem like she wanted to be there and I even saw her rolling her eyes at another customer as they were ordering. I mean if you're going to huff and puff about a customer, do it in the back lol (thats what I have done in the past haha)."}
{"text":"I'll tell you the bummer first. Lee's is CASH-ONLY. If you don't have cash, they do have a private ATM in the dining room that will rape you with a hefty service charge. But...it's worth it. Get back in line and wait for a tasty American style sandwich, but do it on a croissant....good, or step out of your comfort zone and try a Viet sub on a crusty French baguette loaf..BEST (#11 Special combo rocks!)  Whatever you do, if you DON\"T like jalapenos, tell them! 

Other items of note are to be found in the hot-case. Ready-to-eat spicy chicken wings, crunchy thin egg rolls, and a little treat called 'pate chaud'. Picture of a buttery, flaky exterior, almost like filo-dough, with a hot pork or chicken meatball on the inside. They're great for breakfast! 

Smoothies? Oh yeah, with or w/o boba balls. Avocado (l know , I know...but you just have to try it). or mango.."}
{"text":"I love the fresh bread smell (and taste) and their sandwiches are awesome. I'm not too crazy about a cash only place though. They have an ATM machine."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their Lee's iced coffee! If you haven't had it before I highly suggest you try it. Soooo much better then Starbucks (and better priced)  they have a rewards card, so after every 10 you get a free one."}
{"text":"So where do I start.. First let me state that the food is great. Service is complacent, but disrespectful, disheveled and all around rude. CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY CASH ONLY. There, I did the owners job and posted cash only, since you know, there is no notice on the entrance, or at the register. Now, if your used to the Asian culture, it may not be quite as much of a shock to the system, but be prepared to be treated like nothing more than a number, with cash, cuz you know, cash only.

But dang their food, and beverages are good!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! Dirt cheap and delicious, their menu prices could easily double and I wouldn't blink an eye. I have tried them all and like them all. Try the fresh spring rolls. The kids will like the ice cream and the view of the baking in progress. The place is very clean and service is quick and efficient. Not your average sandwich shop."}
{"text":"New awesome lees sandwiches finally came to vegas"}
{"text":"This lee sandwich is better than the ones in San Jose calif.

This place is cleaner and the food is fresh. The one in San Jose on King Road serves old food to lots of dumb people who eat anything. Most look poor and homeless. 

This franchise is doing a better job than the origional owners in San Jose."}
{"text":"It s really terrible,  bad customer services, the guy doesnt know how to place my order, the sandwich is really cold, like just got out from the refrigerator. Never come back here again"}
{"text":"Spoiled by Southern California's delicous banh mi, I attempted to approach Lee's Sandwiches with an open mind.  I was sorely disappointed.  So much for their \"Baguette Factory\"...the bread was hard and seriously tore up the roof of my mouth by the time I was done eating it.  The filling...eh.  I asked for double meat and double vegetables.  I'd hate to see what regular is; I think they maybe forgot to double the filling?  And the iced coffee, while delicous, was mostly ice.  I could barely poke my straw through the lid and then I had to jab-jab-jab it in to make it through the core of ice.  I was so fed up with it all I didn't even bother with the frozen yogurt.  Maybe I missed the best part of it by skipping that?  Oh well.  Thanks anyway Lee. I'll feed my banh mi cravings over at Pho Mailan.

* One star for being inexpensive (unless you count being charged for extra but don't get it)

* One star for cleanliness (as long as you don't look at all the handprints on the windows--come on guys, spring for some Windex and use it!!)"}
{"text":"2.5 stars for the overall experience. I ordered a sandwich on Yelp and went to pick it up 20 mins later. The place was practically empty and the workers just looked at me like I was crazy when J stood away the pick up area waiting for someone to come assist me. When I told them I was picking up an order, they went to the back to retrieve the order, and had to make it on the spot. No apologies were given. The sandwich was decent, but how impersonal the employees are and the hotness of the restaurant (even at midnight) really makes it not a good experience."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here when I'm in the mood for Vietnamese sandwiches. The place is big and always clean. You never have to wait long to get your food. The bread is fresh but I feel that it always cuts the roof of my mouth. So I would recommend getting the grilled pork sandwich. It's my favorite to get because the grilled pork makes the bread soft so it's not as hard to eat. I also enjoy the avocado smoothie and the egg rolls.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's cash only. I never carry cash on me so every time I want to eat here I have to go to the ATM"}
{"text":"March, 12 Monday night

Came to Lee's love there smoothies,
But I hate the customer service the lady front who work the cashier had rude attitude should be fired or be put in the back , not the older lady no she middle age black hair management need to fix this"}
{"text":"Best baguettes this side of the Atlantic! Seriously, I could eat them with butter all day long. The only thing I liked about Paris were the baguettes and now I never have to go back because I can have them at Lee's."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and trying to adjust my schedule from EST. Decided to get the Vietnamese Coffee to wake me up. It woke me up but very disappointed with the portion. I finished my coffee and 3/4 of the cup full with ice."}
{"text":"Loved the veggie summer rolls though a bit highly priced. The BBQ pork sandwich is good because I don't like pate and most other places put pate. I was let down to find out later i was charged 30 cent for jalapeños and they didn't say anything."}
{"text":"Love the banh mi. I won't say it's the best I've ever had, but it's darn good...especially considering that Lee's Sandwich Shop is a chain. The bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Wish it came with a little more meat. You can request it, but it costs extra. ;) The BBQ pork sandwich is pretty good too. Their service is fast and efficient, and they are pretty friendly. I LOVE their iced coffee. Perfect amount of coffee/condensed milk ratio. Nice strong flavor, even tho there is a lot of ice. FYI, they use chipped ice, so it will definitely come up the staw. It doesnt bother me, but some of my friends hate that. ;)"}
{"text":"Tried going to China Magic Noodle right across the street but they were closed (on a Monday?)

Anyways, I'd heard great things and knew that their bread would be good because I've smelled it from their parking lot before.  Clearly I ordered the wrong thing as I chose something from the European side based on the cashier's profiling me. 

Without question I should have gone for the other half of the menu, as it's their specialty.  I will come back, but was not even close to blown away by their club sandwich. 

Also, it's 2015 - I just don't like it when businesses don't bother to have the ability to take debit / credit cards.  Yes, I get what you're doing.  You own the ATM that's fifteen feet away and thus customers are forced to pay your stupid fee.

The place was clean, and the market did seem to have some cool stuff, but if I ever make it back I'll hafta try something from the other side and then possibly edit my review."}
{"text":"Came here after eating pho at Kim Long. There is nothing particularly special about this Lee's Sandwiches other than it being clean and quite spacious. The Iced Coffee is still as good as I remember it. The Banh Mi Thit Nuong wasn't anything special. The bread itself didn't have a good buttery taste. The good thing was that the bread wasn't not overly toasted that my teeth break as I eat the bread (this has happened to me before). The cashier lady wasn't the friendliest but it'll do as long as my order is right. Their register is very modern in that your order and price appears in front of you as they enter it in. The awesome thing is Lee's is open 24 hours but they do have a slight nominal fee when you order during the wee hours. They also don't take credit if your order is under $20. I mainly would only stop here if we were in the Asian part of Vegas or I needed some Iced Coffee for the road back to LA."}
{"text":"For Vietnamese Iced Coffee - awesome place. Also like their BBQ sandwhich #5. Only thing is that they are cash only and I hate carrying cash. There is an ATM there but normally if I'm in a pinch I just run next door to the pharmacy and get cash back. Still - inconvenience and I don't go there as often for this simple reason. That, and I think the caffeine and sugar content of their beloved iced coffees would kill me if I made it a regular stop."}
{"text":"We always come to this place to get coffee and banh mi.  The coffee is always good.  However, the banh mi was not.  We ordered the #5 grill pork and the pork was smelly.  I took one bite and threw it away!"}
{"text":"It is a Lee's Sandwiches. It is located in the Chinatown area.

They offer a lot of desserts and a lot of sandwiches, more than I saw the last time I went to a Lee's Sandwiches.

They have a lot of square footage, including inside the restrooms. There was plenty of room to sit and eat. The food came out pretty quickly and it tasted good, both sandwiches and drinks. All of the members that I bought food for seemed to like the food as well and it was probably a lot of food since there were some leftovers that I had to eat as well.

There is no self serve water. Due to the dehydration of my party I had to keep fetching water from the cashier. (Also, the people I bought food for drank all of the drinks I bought, and my friend thought it was really good compared to the other teas we have bought in the past.)

There is a PokéStop within reach of the building's interior.

Parking is pretty limited, but we got a space in front of the store."}
{"text":"I tried Lee's for the first time last week & I had the lemongrass chicken sandwich.  It was just okay.  This last visit I tried the BBQ pork sandwich.  It was better.  I wish there had been a little more sauce and jalapeño on my sandwich.  Overall the sandwiches are reasonable and the bread is outstanding.  We also tried the pork egg rolls & they were crispy and fresh.  The Thai tea was much too sweet for my liking.  I can't wait to go back & try a new sandwich."}
{"text":"I've waited 45mins for two sandwiches.   They are not busy at all.   Three employees keep running around in circles yet can't seem to make a sandwich.   Not to mention the cashier has handled money and food and has not washed her hands.

Health code??"}
{"text":"This was a new experience, I highly suggest getting their bomb 20pc. Chicken wings to share with the table, but be warned they go quick. The sandwichs have a little bit of a bite from the jalapenos. I do admit they give you not a lit of meat in comparison to the fresh, in-house baked bread. But it is cheap, and you like spicy, and trying new experiences, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich place in the valley! They have a lot of YUMMY things. Vietnamese coffee, bakery and smoothies. 
Prices are fair, service is great, fast and attentive. 
Try it,  you are not going to regret it!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they opened a location in the west valley. We're here several times a week. The banh mi are really good, a great value for less than $5. Breakfast sandwiches are less than $4. They serve their whole menu all day. Sometimes we go at breakfast time and get bbq pork banh mi (#6 on the menu, so good!), or we'll stop by in the afternoon and get breakfast sandwiches. 

They also serve \"European\" sandwiches, i.e. conventional stuff like turkey, ham, or tuna sandwiches, etc, though those cost a bit more. They have snacks like macaron, sesame balls, croissants, steam buns, and pate chaud. (If you like meat pies, try the pork or chicken pate chaud.) Fresh baguettes are $1.39. I love all the food options. You can get it all through the drive-thu too.

The drink menu is neat. We get iced coffees, fruit teas, and milk teas, and all have been good so far. You can add boba or other mix-ins. They have some can/bottle drinks and fountain coke products.

Service has been good every time we go. Eating area is kept clean. Definitely worth checking out. Try that #6."}
{"text":"Ordered hot Jasmine Pearl Tea....as this gentleman calls my number to claim for my drink \"I SPECIFICALLY MADE SURE & ASK HIM...IS THERE ANY BOBA IN MY DRINK? (since it was in a hot cup & not visible) He replied back well if you order it with boba then there should have boba...instead of double checking my order...sure enough as I was already 2 traffic lights away from then...my drink has no boba...pure bad service as i even made sure for them to verify my order & just ignored the fact that i wanted him to check for me..."}
{"text":"Ordered a vegetarian sandwich here, and OMG that's their best sandwich.
Even if you aren't a vegetarian ( I'm not) give it a try! 
BUT the reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I don't like that you HAVE to eat the sandwich right away, if you don't eat it right away the bread goes HARD AS ROCK super fast.
So only order a sandwich if you're eatin it ASAP."}
{"text":"Great  sandwiches. I go there  for breakfast a lot. Their breakfast  combination is very great deal. The coffee  is very  strong  and it will  keep you buzzed all day. The pork bun is light and tasty. My only Grief is they don't want to put  ketchup  in my sandwich. They always give me the packet and it gets messy."}
{"text":"I recently revisited Lee's for old times sakes. My sandwich was pretty meh. Dry, unflavorful, full of uncooked onions (blech!). 
I now work in Central Phx, so much closer to little viet shops like Da Vang and Pho Thanh (ok, not really little) - and those sandwiches while being cheaper are WAYYYYY better. Better bread to filling ration, more flavor, slightly more affordable. 

I mean, of course, if you are on the east side, I suppose Lee's could fulfill a craving. But if you have the option, I'd recommend driving a bit for something better, where you also don't have to pay cash."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches have always been really good. I especially like the ones served in croissants. Recently, my sister told me the sandwiches have gotten smaller and are not as good as they used to be. I have gotten some of their baguettes in this last month, and they do seem different. I wish they hadn't changed their portion size from before."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. I enjoy the bbq pork sandwich, thai tea and banana delights!"}
{"text":"This place is great for Bahn mi. After moving to Phoenix, I was worried that a good Vietnamese sandwich would be hard to find but was so happy when I saw their sign. I prefer the combo special but the other types are great as well. An iced coffee and sandwich is a must for me on my days off."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I My favorite is there BBQ pork sandwich, ice coffee, and there dessert.  Also there food is cheap and delicious.  Especially when i lost all my money at the roulette table, I want something good but cost effective, this is the place to be!! Thanks Lees!!"}
{"text":"Would get five stars but the some of the staff aren't the brightest. They have messed up my order twice out of the 4 times I've been here. There sandwiches are great though and it's like a little Asian market inside. Only able to do card transactions if spending ten dollars or more which sucks. Other than that everything else is good will not be going to subway anymore."}
{"text":"Prices raised again. I've always enjoyed the grilled pork (Asian) sandwich, but very little pork on it. 
Cannot walk near the place without inhaling boatloads of cigarette smoke, extremely toxic on the weekends. I'm still coughing an hour later!  I won't go back there."}
{"text":"This is a great little cheap place off the strip. It is open 24 hours a day. I had the special combo Bahn mi. I didn't really like the bread, it was a little too hard for my taste. And there wasn't much filling. The ice coffee was great though. A little too much ice, but the coffee was really refreshing for a hot day in Vegas."}
{"text":"Everything here has been great. Especially the Vietnamese style sandwiches. Also get egg rolls.

Cash only though. Boo."}
{"text":"Wow, I was amazed at the number of staff that work at this place and the steady stream of people that frequent this place.  But even with all their staff (I counted 7) their service was quite slow.  I ordered their special combination baguette and their signature \"Lee's coffee\".  I waited over 10 mins for my order.   Their baguette was fresh but there wasn't much meat inside.  There are other places that make these submarines that taste better than this place.  But what I really was not happy with was their \"Lee's Iced Coffee\".  Even though I asked for less ice, the cup still had more ice than it had coffee.  I was only able to get 5 sips out of the cup and was left with cup of ice.  For 3 bucks I could have had a Starbuck's coffee and not been so upset.  This drink is the biggest rip off.  Don't waste your money on this."}
{"text":"The Asian sandwiches are so good. Just like the subway sand which but with more meat."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to this Lee's before their \"grand opening\" yet it was still super busy! Living in SoCal I enjoy Lee's and this is one of the nicer stores. It has a good layout and plenty of seating. I don't know if it is the new equipment but the coffee here tasted just a little better than the coffee I've had in the SoCal stores. From what I've heard they make the bread fresh in this store although I couldn't taste the difference. Like all Lee's I really wish they accepted credit cards but other than that it was a good experience. I hope to check it out after they are officially open and the Frozen Yogurt machines are working!"}
{"text":"Have had the bbq pork two times. The bread is doughy and lacked in freshness. The pork tasted old and salty. Not memorable. No reason to return."}
{"text":"I like the place. Breads are good. Everything look clean. The only place that have bread I like. Recommend."}
{"text":"Banh mi is okay. I prefer the bbq beef, which they don't have, and i like my sandwiches to be loaded with veggies. The French horn pastry, now that is goood. I also like how the iced coffee is creamy."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews on this place before I came. If I did, I would have went elsewhere. This place is a TOTAL 2 star. I'll give it props for being brightly lit and decently clean. I ordered the coconut waffle, some frozen yogurt, an iced mocha coffee and little cream puffs that they make there. The coconut waffle was green....WEIRD. It didn't have much flavor at all. My iced coffee was HORRIBLE. I barely took 2 sips. The red velvet frozen yogurt tasted gross. It had a really weird flavor. I can't quite put my finger on it but it didn't taste like the red velvet yogurt I get a golden spoon.  The cream puffs were ok. They definitely needed more cream. One thing that really stood out, and not in a good way, was the loud speak system that announces when your order is ready. 
I've made a rule. DONT EAT AT ANYTHING LESS THAN 4 STAR. I, again, broke my own rule. I try to be spontaneous though. I try to \"live in the old days\" were Yelp doesnt rule my life. And, that fails me everytime. There are so many good places to eat in Chinatown. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall in the Chinatown area, I am happy that I can stop by 24 hours a day to pick up my sandwich or Iced Coffee with Milk.  They are probably my two favorite things to eat, and probably the only decent option if you are hungry in the middle of the night with only a few dollars left in your name.  Haha.

Lots of seating areas available and they have restrooms available for the customers.  I wouldn't say it is the cleanest spot I have visited, but it is not anywhere close to being labeled as \"dirty\".  Yea, expect bread crumbs on the tables if the staff didn't get a chance to wipe off the tables before you use them.

I always order their Special sandwich, and their iced coffee is amazing.  But it annoys me that the iced coffee are so expensive, but I guess you just have to bite the bullet if you need that extra shot of caffeine to make your drive back to wherever you came from.  Oh yeah, be aware of loud obnoxious drunk people loitering around during late hours.  Hahaha."}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week! Everything is always fresh and delicious and the place itself is super clean. #17 extra veggies-you're welcome. Their coffee is also to die for. My only gripe is that they aren't open later. I work graveyard twice a week and I'd love to be able to get some coffee before I go to work but they're long closed by the time I'm heading to work"}
{"text":"I was excited to see Lee's opening on this side of town. Love their sandwiches and enjoyed them when I'm in Houston. I was passing by today so decided to stop and grab couple of banh mi and sesame balls. I got the grilled chicken and lemongrass beef banh mi.  It was great! Smaller than the ones in Houston but the bread was perfect. Had the perfect crunch. I didn't get to eat the lemongrass as my husband decided to try the \"stinky\" sandwich (he's referring to the pickled daikon) and said it was flavorful. Next time we will get few baguettes to go. They were that good! Will be back. I went at 11am so no line. Oh...baby sesame balls were good too."}
{"text":"I feel like I went to an entirely different restaurant because I had a really good experience both times I went to Lee's Sandwiches. I was leery about trying it out because I checked Yelp beforehand... but I figured I waited this long for the place to open up that I had to try it out.

The clean, modern, open layout of the restaurant first attracted me. On the right side, they have self-serve frozen yogurt which I have yet to try. In the middle is where you line up to place your order and to the left is where you pick up. There are several tables and booths available.

I ordered the special combination banh mi and a thai iced tea with boba. Based on previous reviews, I made sure to request easy ice. Their system is like a well oiled machine. The wait time was less than 5 minutes. There is no chance you would miss your number from being called because there are TV screens that feature the order number and and a robotic voice that calls out the number as well.

The banh mi I ordered was worth the price. For under $4, the foot long baguette was fresh, crunchy on the outside and warm and soft in the inside. The filling was delicious and was the right amount despite what other reviews say. I was completely full and satisfied with my meal.

My one major complaint is that they accept cash only. Thank goodness I had cash because I didn't see a sign and I didn't want to pay the ATM fee. As I was leaving, I looked around everywhere for a \"cash only\" sign and only saw a 2\" x 2\" sign on the door. There is no excuse for an establishment this big to not take debit or credit.

My experience at Lee's Sandwiches was very pleasant and I plan to become a frequent patron if I have the cash on hand. Another plus... it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Is it me, or are they quite stingy with their ingredients? :(. Maybe I've been spoiled by Huey Thai, but when I ask for jalapeños, I don't mean one slice, and I definitely don't mean the thinnest slice... I will gladly pay extra - sheesh. It's not just with jalapeños. My wife orders their chicken sandwich. I don't remember what it's called, but they are damn stingy with their ingredients!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in town. I love Vietnamese sandwiches and this place is the bomb! 
Here's the deal. Ca$h only. NBD, just bring some.
Sandwiches are less then $5, but they are light on fillings. Again, NBD, order extra meat $1.5 and extra veggies  $1. Boom, big bomb sandwich that is made on super fresh bagett that will fill u up! 
If u don't want a Vietnamese sandwich they have turkey, ham club etc on Baggett or croissant.
So good, buy two!"}
{"text":"I waited until this shop got its feet wet and had gained experience.     
Their food is delicious I mean really delicious
They have a nice selection
A huge assortment of drinks, teas coffee etc
Lots of international treats 
Omg omg omg baguettes that are so crispy & always hot and are very reasonable for take out.

Defiantly worthy of a try."}
{"text":"Came in here and then place was empty but every table was filthy and had trash on it.   There was an employee on break in the dinning room and she didn't even clean it after her break.  The boba was too hard. We won't be back if the front of the house looks like this, what's the kitchen look like?"}
{"text":"I'd maybe even think about 3.5 cuz it's open 24/7.
But this place is like a subway for Banh mi as the hubby termed it. We tried it as a quick snack the other day (got the bbq pork one). I thought it was pretty ok, hubby didn't seem to think too highly of it. Though he did eat his half quite happily. 
So the next day we went back to grab a couple sandwiches and some Vietnamese iced coffee for our road trip to the Grand Canyon. Again cuz they are open 24/7 this seemed like the best option.
We picked one special combo sandwiches and a pork meatball sandwich this time. 
Fist let me say the coffee was absolutely delllllicious!! But you get a very small amount with the cup packed full of ice. It worked for us cuz we had already gotten some Starbucks before we headed out of our hotel. 
As for the sandwiches, I liked the combo one (hubby refused to try it afraid it had hidden head cheese). But we both tried the meatball one and it was absolutely awful!!! Literally we each suffered thru one bite and threw it out. 
So overall I'd say the sandwiches are ok....Iv def has many many banh mi before and these are average at best. And like I said avoid that meatball one!
Oh I almost forgot we got a coconut waffle with our morning coffee too. It was yummmmy :)"}
{"text":"Way better than any fast food establishment.  A taste of home for me!  I was over-joyed to discover this place.  Definitely worth the 15 minute drive for the vietnamese sandwiches.  Authentic and CHEAP.  Definitely good eats.  One minor downside is that they sort of skimp on the meat and this is coming from someone who normally orders veggie sandwiches!  Still love it though!"}
{"text":"I was rather disappointed in the service I just received! I purchased four boba beverages about 20 minutes ago, and the flavors were deceiving! I got an avocado boba smoothie; it tasted like they just blended milk and ice! I had no flavor of avocado whatsoever in my smoothie! My cousin got a honeydew boba, and no surprise! It tasted nothing like honeydew; it was very watery! My mom got a cantaloupe and it was way too sweet and it was gross! She politely asked if she could exchange it for a different drink, of equal value, and the manager rudely told her, \"don't you know cantaloupe is sweet?\" as if my mother didn't know it, and he went on to say, also is a rudely manner, \"well you already paid for it, so there's nothing I can do.\" I was so upset I did not even want to argue with the manager! whoever is the owner I suggest you train your staff on customer service! I would give it no stars but unfortunately that's not an option!"}
{"text":"I thought it was going to be a small simple place actually a dive, but it's very large, well lit and clean. Parking lot out front. Many Asian young people were eating and hanging out which I thought was a good sign. 

The young woman behind the counter explained a few dishes was sweet and helpful. 

We chose the pate chauffeur large ( chicken in a bun similar to philo dough, it was okay. We really enjoyed our # 79 lemon G chicken sand which we shared but when we return I'm getting my own. The prices are good and the food fresh. 

One orders at the counter so no tipping and they do accept credit cards. 
One can also purchase lots of packaged asian items."}
{"text":"Today was my first time ordering from this location and I was disappointed. I ordered the #1 Combo special and was disappointed. No pâté, one thin slice of ham and one thin slice of head cheese."}
{"text":"This location is overpriced!!! 
   I'm a long time fan @ Lee's sandwiches . I've been in most of their locations here in Vegas & Cali . I was so excited there'll be a Lee's sandwiches open close by me . Today I finally made it in to this location & let me tell u what a DISAPPOINTMENT!!! First of its a Vietnamese sandwiches place but not even 1 Vietnamese worker nor customer that I see . I think it runs by Filipino which is odd but that is not an issue .  I checked out everything seems to be overprice  especially Vietnamese coffee because I'm a coffee drinker . All the locations I've been to a 16oz. bottle cost less than $4 buck & if u buy a box of 6 about $ 22~ .  In this store $6.25 / bottle . I mean Really??? I know they want to make a profit so others but that's a ripoff & don't tell me the coffee taste better here . They all come from same place . With that being said this is my first time & the last time I ever come to this location..  BS.."}
{"text":"I'm so conflicted.
Forty-five minute wait, but
Sandwich was so good!

Side items up front.
But pastries disappointed.
Buns are passable.

Hope you have some cash
Because they don't take credit.
But they'll split your bills.

Crusty, chewy bread.
Crisp and fresh ingredients.
Sandwich, a delight.

Wouldn't mind the wait
But the store was so empty.
Hard to recommend.

Want to go again
But really don't like the wait
Maybe call ahead?"}
{"text":"We came here in a big group before our big race. 

Sandwiches are of course the bomb! The rude lady took away 1 star. They have also smoothies and bobas. 

Any baguette,I think, will taste delicious. It's Lee's and so famous!"}
{"text":"I just don't get it .... the Vietnamese sandwiches are horrible.  I've eaten tons of banh mi, i'm Vietnamese. I love banh mi. It's just low quality - from the bread to the fillings. 

I remember when they first opened their first store and yes, i was there to eat it. Back then the bread and fillings was so much better. More like a real baguette. All good things must come to an end."}
{"text":"Mixed Blessings...

Went to Lees for the first time. 

Sandwich was a 5.  Great meat, cheese, bread etc. Fresh and delish!

Got a drink (iced tea). Tea was great. $2.00. 75% ice, 25% drink. Drank the 3oz of tea...asked for a refill...50 cents for a refill. 

Ruined the experience. Probably won't be back. But then again, the sandwich was a 5..."}
{"text":"I ordered a #2 pork roll sandwich.   I nearly chipped/broke my tooth biting into it.  Sandwich was hard as a rock.  
Very disappointing compared to California's lee sandwiches."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is...but every time I've eaten here, I've left with a not-so-happy feeling. I don't understand why, though. The sandwiches are good. I mean, good and fresh.

Maybe it's because it's not in San Jose. Maybe I feel that having a Lee's in Mesa is a betrayal of my 408 roots, ya know? Or, maybe I'm just a basket case. I like to think it's a combination of the two.

I'll clear my head and say it IS good, but just not as good as the one in San Jose...or Milipitas. Yea, I went there.

I like that the bread is baked on site and I love that I've got a tiny bit of Vietnamese sandwiches here in Mesa. :)

Ok, I talked myself into it - I'm going to go have a Lee's Sandwich for dinner."}
{"text":"It's all about the baguette!! I will start with what I didn't like, the steamed bun with an egg and pork. There was a lot of bun with a tiny piece of meat and a hard boiled type egg. We were helped by the woman who takes orders who kindly described a lot of menu items. My wife and I split the BBQ Bork and Grilled pork Bahn Mi's. My grilled one had a lot less of pork than the BBQ one but both had excellent flavors and the bread... Wow! A perfectly baked baguette with such a great flavor and perfect crunch to it. It's a place you smell like well after you have left which can be a good or bad thing."}
{"text":"This review is for their Iced Coffee...It should be renamed Ice with about 3 sips of coffee! It was all gone, and I was still HELLA TERSTY!

I didn't try any of the food, but with all the low reviews , I don't think I ever will. My go to spot is Dakao for some Banh Mi action...ALOHA!!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(58/365) \"ICE with coffee\""}
{"text":"This Lee's is like a mini market with packaged snacks, baked goods, refrigerated desserts, and bottled Thai iced tea and Vietnamese coffee. We picked up some sandwiches for the road before leaving Vegas. The sandwich held up well even after a few hours on the road. I really like the bread they use for their banh mi sandwiches, and I was impressed with their croissants as well. A welcome addition to Vegas dining options, especially since it's open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was good, but it was on the bland side of things. I've had a few Bah Mi before and the bread makes the sandwich. The bread wasn't warmed up and it just lacked flavor. If I'm in the area again, perhaps I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and you cannot beat their prices!  Only negative is the automated system used to call order numbers.  It is annoying and ongoing."}
{"text":"Date and Time: Wednesday, 2/25/15 @ 10:30pm

Oh lee's sandwiches, how you made bomb bbq pork bahn mi's for me in the past. What did you do to me last night :( 

I usually go to lee's sandwiches off the the 215 and eastern, but since I was near the strip, I decided to stop to this one -_-\" I should have gotten pho instead.

I ordered 2 bbq pork bahn mi, a special combination bahn mi, and a lee's coffee. The cost is around $18. I asked the cashier what was in the special combination bahn mi and he had no clue, he was nice enough to ask someone to tell us what's inside there (head cheese, jabon, pate), well I never had any of those interesting meats (I did not like the after taste, I'll stick to bbq pork). My love and I decided to go with the usual but try something different as well. We both took a bite of the special combination (props for those who can handle this taste), with the bread scraping against my gums and ripping my skin off, I already knew my bahn mi was not  going to be good.

I usually expect my bread to my bite-able, but no. BBQ pork had a off putting taste to it. I don't know, I felt like I had food poisoning after an hour of eating this meal. I will attempt to eat at my usual spot and let you know how it goes, but as for lee's in china town. I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I like the flavor, but they really need to make a less sweet version. They either only have the pre-made coffee, or black coffee."}
{"text":"We waited in line for 30 minutes only to be told when we got to the register that they were out of sandwiches! Very poor service! And the place is already dirty, to think they have only been opened 2 days!"}
{"text":"My Sister and I ordered take out, the grilled chicken and the BBQ pork Banh Mi, I also ordered a carrot smoothie and she ordered a Thai tea.  The sandwiches were soooooooooooooooooooooo good and the carrot smoothie was awesome.  Three sandwiches and two drinks under $17!! Great deal!!! I was full and happy under 500 calories for a few bucks!! Seems almost too good to be true :) If only it wasn't so far from my own house :("}
{"text":"Fabulous French Baguettes are baked on premises and used for their Vietnamese sandwiches - Banh Mi. The bread is so good, I bring two hot loafs home and 
freeze with my recently discovered frozen fresh bread method (double wrapped, once in paper towels and again in aluminum foil), although at only $1 each, one could go there every day to but fresh. My choice of the many varieties of Banh Mi (three times!) is the \"Bar-B-Que Pork\" and it is fabulous! It is loaded with pickled carrot, daikon radish, cilantro, onion and jalapeno. \"Grilled Pork\" will my next choice, as it is highly recommended by several Reviewers. One hint to make it even better, opt for \"extra meat\" at only $1 more."}
{"text":"The 24 hour location is a huge plus for pre or post mega climbing days.  I've had better banh mi at various independent restaurants in both CA and CO, but it's decent and I have yet to find a better place in Vegas. The iced coffee on the other hand was packed with ice to the top, leaving room for a few ounces of coffee; for $3+ that was a scam."}
{"text":"March 13th, 2011 marks the opening of Lee's Sandwich, an popular Vietnamese chain from California. There was a lot of hype for Lee's to open and I never had Lee's before so I was curious to find out what all the fuss was about. Is it really all that and a side of a pennyworth drink? 

Lee's Sandwich is open 24 hours (or \"always\") and is CASH ONLY. The man whom seemed to be the manager says it may be a permanent thing. The restaurant is pretty big, there were tons of tables, and it seems to have a modern look going on (think Yogurt Land). Oh speaking of Yogurt Land they also will be serving froyo (frozen yogurt). At the time of my visit the yogurt machines were not up and running yet. If you aren't into yogurt thats okay because they also have che (Vietnamese desserts). Aside from that they have a decent variety of baked goods(Deli Manjoo 5.89/20 pieces) and baguettes ($0.99/each).

Nowww onto the sandwiches. I saw the price ranges of $2.99 to $3.89. I must admit there were a lot of choices. Each sandwich comes in a 10 inch baguette that is baked fresh each day (baguette bag says every 30 minutes). Traditional banh mi flavors were available such as the combination and grilled pork. European sandwiches and breakfast sandwiches were also available which by the way seems really weird to me to have a roast beef and turkey sandwich made in the same place with my jam packed daikon/carrot cured pork sandwich. Anyways my grilled pork Vietnamese sandwich was somewhat bland, the bread looked like it was gutted out, and felt like a lack of authenticity. I know that its a franchise, but the sandwich I ate does not deserve the name of banh mi and should only be referred to as a Vietnamese sandwich. 

Today was also the soft opening so if you are going within these next couple days expect some delay and kinks. I must of heard \"sorry we're out of \"insert item\" \" at least 4 times for 4 different items. At one point I heard that they ran out of milk, one of the most essential items for them to make their coffee. 

I will probably stop back a few more times to truly gauge my feelings about Lee's Sandwich, but at this moment I rather get something from Mr. Sandwich/Hue Thai or Dakao."}
{"text":"4 for the incredible fresh baguettes made there. Fab $1 bins for day old bread, and great to-go selections. Been coming here for years. Last few visits have been disappointing for sandwiched-and I've been coming here for years. Very strong iced coffee. Hard bread on viet sandwiches and subs :( great croissant sandwhiches."}
{"text":"Very tasty  very cheap bahn mi! So happy to have this in the peoria area. It was very packed and tool a little longer then probably normal to serve but they just opened less then a week ago! We just ordered grilled chicken #4 and bbq pork #6 and they were delicious! Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Very good/cheap Vietnamese sandwiches..I wouldn't call it fast food...more like painfully slow...I think there is one guy preparing all the food :-/...it's cash only but I'd advise not to use their ATM..it only gave me $20 but debted me $60...when I asked the guy who I saw refilling the machine he waived me off and told me to go to the cashier..I was ready to call the cops!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars, but maybe I didn't get the full experience since we arrived a little before 4:00am lol. It wasn't crowded which was nice and it was a really clean place. 

The lady who took our order was patient, quiet.. didn't really get a good feel of her though. My cousin and I ordered 4 Banh Mi sandwiches (Combo, Special and Grilled Pork).. well more like I ordered 3 and she ordered 1, lol. I also ordered 5 fried eggrolls to eat right away because I was so hungry. 

It took awhile for our order to be made. I understand we ordered 4 sandwiches, but didn't think it would take 20 minutes. The sandwiches were a little dry, needed more veggies and pate in my opinion. I think I'd rather have sandwiches from our Vietnamese bakeries here in Seattle. The eggrolls were very good - warm, crispy, good amount of seasoning.

I think I would come back to try other items though. But maybe this time I won't come during the wee hours of the night/morning. =)"}
{"text":"It took them that long to open its door. I remember seeing just the  Lee's Sandwiches sign in ages every time my family wanted some Pho instead of the casinos' buffets.
Finally, we had a chance to step in its big huge doors last weekend. They make sure you  get in the store or what, they don't have just one entrance, but two over sized double door entrances. Feng Shui? 
It's a WOW. I am used to the small sandwiches shops, or even other Lee's I've been to, not as huge, nice, clean, quality constructions as this one. They don't have the typical tables and tables next to each other, whatever you say, the next table can hear you all. It's spaciest but private feeling. I guess 'cause of the expensive glass dividers? Very good for hang out. That's probably why they have the yogurt station. The yogurt station wasn't ready when I was there. So I can't tell about the yogurt. They will have their Grand Opening on March 25, 2011. Hopefully, they can get the supply from Pinkberry.  
We ordered the typical Lee's, iced  milked coffee, combination sandwiches, they have on their bags, baked every 30 minutes.  Their bread really fresh and baked within 30 minutes.  They must make their biscotti from their over 30 minutes bread then.  How in the world they throw out all their over 30 minutes breads. My kids love their biscotti. I ordered their chicken wings, and chicken nuggets for my kids to bring back to the hotel for after swimming snacks. Also you must try their green coconut waffles. Very gooood.  I've been to other Lee's and bought the ready packed food. For those who want some French taste for a lazy morning, or  a late night, try the French  pate on the selves if you can afford a little bit more than the Lee's fast food prices Pate. My cousins from France used to sneak in her suitcase and through customs for me the pates, can't bring meat products to USA. Heat the pate a little bit on a skillet, with fresh baked bread, and a little bit of the Maggi soy sauce (they also sale the very good kind Maggi there). Out of this world.  Don't forget the tin boxed cookies also on the shelves, make a very good gift.  Very fine cookies. I don't like the Frentel Butter on the shelves though.  It's a wanna be Beure Bretel from Normandy, France, but nothing like Bretel. 
Well, at least now we can bring quality food back to the hotel and munch. My kids love the snacks after swimming and  I don't have to pay the ridiculous hotel prices."}
{"text":"What can you expect from a place that offers to go Vietnamese sandwiches and American ones alike. It's a great place if you need a quick bite to eat or a rocket blasting Vietnamese coffee.

This one's pretty clean, and the service is very quick."}
{"text":"I haven't found a sandwich I didn't like, their ice coffee is delish!!!!! And the French horns oh soo yummy!!! Love Lee's Sandwiches!!! Remember it's a cash only place, but they do have a atm inside! If you haven't tried Lee's you should!"}
{"text":"They locked the door right before closing time. They must not want my money."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches are awesome! Just wish they were in Minnesota!  But whenever I am out West , I make sure to pick up a few sandwiches to take home."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is a great Vietnamese sandwich shop. I love the mint milk, it is so refreshing. It is perfect after a meal or anytime and they give you a big size. Of course you can get it boba or they have a wide selection of other teas and drinks:  Taro, Honeydew, Soy Bean, carrot, strawberry and passion fruit drinks! Italian sodas, mint jelly, watermelon, sugar cane, iced lattes. 

Any and all smoothies:  banana, apple, avocado (yes, avocado), cranberry, durian (mmm yes, you read that right), carrot, durian-green bean, green bean, jack fruit, lychee ect. too many to list. 

They make their own bread on site and the ingredients are always fresh and quality. I am a vegetarian and there are a few options as far as sandwiches go:  

Vegetarian-Fried tofu, vermicelli, bean curd, yam, carrot, house pickle, jalapeno, cilantro, salt & pepper and soy sauce. Very good if you like fried tofu like me!

California avocado-Avocado, double cheese, lettuce, tomato, mustard.

Don't forget, you can always ask them to add to any sandwich to make it custom! They have pork and shrimp egg rolls, coconut waffles, croissants and pastries."}
{"text":"For a chain it's not bad.  Still better then Subway but falls short compared to Mekong Sandwiches.  Sugar cane is great and the staff is very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm anywhere near this place, I have to stop in!
Its kind of awkward to go to a Asian Sandwich Shop to get the best French Baguette in the East Valley but hey, they know how to do it right so I won't complain! Seriously thou, their French Baguette it amazing and I LOVE #56 with extra Salami.

The wife and I also love their Boba Smoothies, hers is Mango and I'm a fan of the Raspberry. The Boba sometimes is a little sticky but I still think its better than Lee Lees or the Street.

Be warned thou! Bring Cash!!! They have a ATM machine incase you forget but try to remember to have some cash on you."}
{"text":"Woke up one morning with a random craving for Thai Tea. (Weird, right.)

Went on Yelp to search for \"thai tea\" and was surprised to see a Lee's Sandwich just opened in my area.

Drove on over and really liked the place. Very clean, bright, and reminded me of many Japanese boba spots in Hawaii or Spring Mountain.

Ordered my usual chicken bahn mi, thai tea, and a manapua (siopao). 
I know I only wanted the thai tea but, since I was there, I figured I might as well make the most out of my trip. And I wanted to compare it to other bahn mi's I've had.

Chicken bahn mi was good. BUT, my initial thought was \"where's the chicken?\" There wasn't enough meat. I, also, ordered extra veggies and it didn't seem like extra. Total disappointment. 
I did like the jalapeno kicker in the sandwich tho. I, usually, add sriracha to my 'wich to add some heat to it.

Thai tea was yummy. I liked that it wasn't too sweet and thicker than I've normally had. I assume from the condensed milk.

Pork siopao (manapua) was yummy! I liked that it had a boiled egg in the middle. Reminded me alot of Bale siopaos back home in Hawaii.


All in all; I love bahn mis yet, have yet to find my go-to spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Leaving Vegas Sunday morning? Have a massive hangover? No time for pho since you wanna bypass the horrid traffic you're about to encounter?

Had enough Mickey Ds, Earls, and In-n-Out for the weekend?

Well come grab some Lee's. Quick, fast, not exactly cheap, not exactly delicious, but it will suffice. 

When in Vegas, you know you're going to pay more than you normally do for food.

No, it's not the best Banh Mi, but if you're in a hurry and looking for a good portable to go food item, then Lee's should do the job.

I usually got the number #11 combination..in all honestly, I have no idea what's in it.. they always advertise it..so why not?

It's around $5 bucks for an okay size banh mi. Don't expect anything grand, just know you won't be hungry. I usually ask for more pickled veggies..which they charge $.25 for..and if i'm really hungry i go for an order of spring rolls too--a bit disappointing yes..but when you're hungover and hungry (since you were too drunk to make it steak and eggs the night before) the spring rolls actually taste decently refreshing. Plus that and the banh mi is easy to eat in your car ride home (or flight).

As for the coffee...if you already have a hangover and is sensitive to caffine..I would skip it. That stuff is strong..and yes you would get a bigger headache!

A few things.. Remember to bring cash, listen for your number to be called out, and don't complain..since you know what you're paying for..just eat the damn sandwich and be on with it. OH if you're lucky, they often give out samples of their other items.

So..1 star for being open 24hrs, good accessibility, and 2 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Not a bad sandwich place. I had Lee's before in SF. This is open 24/7. They have plenty of seating inside and other snacks for you to buy.  I got the grilled pork sandwich and the traditional viet sandwich.  They were good, but the grilled pork I had better.  The bread was fresh and chewy."}
{"text":"I have to stop by Lee's every time I'm in Vegas. There's a ton of them all over Cali but for some odd reason the sandwiches are much tastier at this location.  Best part about it is there's never a long line when I go (I must be going at the right time!!)  

This location is fairly large and spacious, it's always clean, staff is generally friendly, and the service is quick.  

It's located in a strip mall not too far from the strip, the only problem I have sometimes is finding a cab back to my hotel unless I rent a car during my stay.  Otherwise, it's great!"}
{"text":"Large seating area and little store on the inside. Decent variety of Banh mi's and croissant sandwiches. Bread is always crisp and soft in the middle. I especially like the melon shake if you wanted something sweet. Overall great place and easy to find."}
{"text":"ridiculous credit card policy. I wanted to buy some side dishes but because they have a no credit card policy for things under $10, they lost a sale and they lost a customer. I used to come here because they were close to my house and open 24 hours but no longer will I support this business over something so bureaucratic. I've had managers in the past let this stupid rule slide.  they think it's logical to lose a customer over a .50 cent credit card fee? I'll be happy to pay that fee, but nope, ridiculous manager thinks it's better to lose a customer."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwiches are the best, never fails with extra pickled carrots. Iced Thai tea very delicious.  Always my place ---to go plane"}
{"text":"Lee's was a staple back home and happy to find them out here in AZ. Got my classic #11 with some crispy hot wings."}
{"text":"I think this place is open 24hrs

Great Sandwiches and friendly service. 

Very clean place. Brightly lit too. Alot of locals working in the hotels seen eating here.

Cheap too. They are good Bun-me sandwiches."}
{"text":"Such a great sandwich shop. The bread was fresh. So fresh. I cannot wait for the one on Rainbow to open. This place is 24 hours and about the only sandwich shop in Vegas that is open 24 hours other than something like Subway (yuck). Highly recommended. A must if you like fresh sandwiches and good service."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here after a show one night. It's always open, which is dope. The sandwich I had was so tasty that I ordered another to go. I wound up chipping one of my k9's when I ate it later at the hotel we were staying at. But that's probably my own damn fault for scarfing it down all fast."}
{"text":"I love the vietnamese sandwiches, but the downside is that the bread they use is always hard . So when I take bites I take hard chews of all bread and end up eating most of the meat last. Their bread is good, tasty, and soft when it's fresh. I wish they would serve the freshest bread for the sandwiches too! Their thai tea boba is deliscious! Milky, smooth, and sweet! Just the way I like it. They also have free wifi and a very contemporary feel to the interior decoration. 

If you're looking to get a kick start on vietnamese lingo, I'd suggest to hang out at this spot and learn about the numbers in vietnamese! Their service machine calls out your ticket in english and vietnamese! So when you're hanging around lee's definitely count with the service machine, and I guarantee you you'll be a vietnamese counting guru with in minutes!"}
{"text":"Once again I made the weekly trek to the Chandler/Gilbert/Mesa area to meet Mr. Z and Mr. G for lunch.  This time we chose Lee's for a) its affordability and b) the said tastiness of the sandwiches.

Well, the sandwich was not a disappointment.  Very straightforward menu, if you go for the traditional as opposed to some of the more interesting choices they have.  Went with a ham and turkey on croissant.  Croissant was flaky and buttery.  Would have liked more choices in spreads, besides mayo and yellow mustard.  Not a fan of either.  I tried sweet and sour sauce on it, not bad.

If you are in the area and need a meal.  Lee's is quick, cheap, and tasty.  Spectacular, no, but filling, yes.  And remember bring cash or pay the ATM fees at the joint."}
{"text":"I stopped by for an iced coffee for the drive back to SoCal.  We didn't order any food for the road because I don't allow snacking / eating in my car...some people are total slobs.  My buddy commented that this shop is the cleanest of all the Lee's Sandwiches he has been to. I thought that was a good observation.  Kudos to the mgmt team."}
{"text":"I wish there are more Vietnamese banh mi options in Vegas, but alas, it doesn't seem like it so I begrudgingly come in for a baguette  and a coffee before hitting the gym."}
{"text":"Great and cheap sandwich place to get a good lunch! It is cash only but it allows them to keep the price down! # 5 Asian sandwich all the way...."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the Spring Mtn. location, but the bread seemed fresher than the Lee's I've been to in CA.  Might have just got lucky though.  I got my usual vegetarian baguette, which did not have as much stuff in it as I am used to.  Could have used a couple more things of cilantro too.  But the bread was definitely better.

Kind of disappointed they did not have any deli manjoo, but it was after 8 p.m. on a weeknight, so that could be my bad timing.  No wait though."}
{"text":"24 hour perk. 

It's cool for big groups which is why I went in the first place.

Eh.. food's okay. Rumor has it they changed their ingredients.. Not sure what kind of magic's in in it now, but I'm less willing to try it.

It's always clean, good for them. 

Their boba.. ah yes, the reason I even step into Lee's is for a boba drink. Honey dew's my fav, but recently I've been getting Taro. 

I mean for 24 hour it's good, but if I really want Taro boba, I'll go to the Pho Hung."}
{"text":"I guess I am a fan since I make it out here at least once a week.  It's very close to my workplace and I am very into the Bahn Mi.  It's convenient.

It's a hit or miss with their sandwiches.  My usual orders are: grilled chicken and the pork Bahn Mi.  

For people who do not order the vietnamese sandwiches (Bahn Mi) - they usually have a distinctive smell to them, partly because of the picked vegetables that they add.  So, dont think it's weird ..."}
{"text":"Banh my thit nuong, number 5 on the menu is my favorite. Ice coffee is not as good as it is used to be, but overall Lee Sandwiches are one of best places to get Vietnamese food in Tempe/Chandler."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the clean, modern looking establishment that's opened 24hrs a day. They had screens that announced your order in both English and Vietnamese. Too bad the food doesn't deliver. Many of the sandwiches are filled with too much mayo or whatever fatty stuff that is. The pate chaud was not that best I've had either. I tried the Bun with grilled meat and cha goi (egg roll) which was mediocre. 

1 star for nice and clean restaurant
1 star for being opened 24hrs
1 star for serving Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"Found a Lee's sandwich close to the office! I like getting the coffee in the morning so this is a great spot. It's not on Google maps though which is kind of strange."}
{"text":"This is the best Lee's Sandwhiches location in Las Vegas. If you're ever in Vegas and want to get away from all the chaos of sin city just come here. They have really good food. You don't have to wait too long because the service is really fast. Oh & also it's SUPER friendly. It's open 24 hours so you can come satisfy your cravings whenever. I recommend the lees coffee!"}
{"text":"Powder smoothies ? not even real fruit or I hope its not real fruit must be some nasty old fruit then. Ordered a mango and taro smoothie and both tasted like powder mix. Nasty  boba is tasteless. Sandwiches I tried one time , I was not bad and was not good but ill never order it again because it left a boring taste in my mouth.  Mr lee  smh"}
{"text":"Have you ever had so much to drink and was starving, but your body is just too damn lazy to put in any effort for pho or oxtail soup? I come to Lee's for a sandwich, of course. There's really no effort in eating a sandwich. You open your mouth, bite down, chew and swallow.

I made the boytoy bring me here since I sort of had a craving for banh mi and because he said he's never been. This is probably the worst place to introduce somebody to banh mi. Lee's is like the McDonald's of banh mi. Many locations, not the best quality. The bread was not crunchy. It was chewy and made my jaw hurt after a while. If you're not a fan of liver (like I am), don't forget to order your banh mi without pate. The cafe sua da never fails me, although it always comes with a crazy stupid amount of ice. 

It's open 24/7 and does the job. That's pretty much it."}
{"text":"The staff was kind and the sandwich I ordered was yummy! It was the BBQ one, I can't remember if it was pork or chicken, but thers only one BBQ one anyways. 
If you don't like spicy, ask for no peppers. There's also cilantro in the sandwich so ask for no cilantro if that doesn't tickle your pickle. 
I don't mind carrots or the other stuff, so I kept that on. So yea."}
{"text":"*This review is for the baguettes only

We stopped by here after Pho because my friend wanted me to try the baguettes. They didn't have any ready so they made them fresh for us. They were a dollar. I wish I could use more words to describe how ecstatic and happy I was once I had that gorgeous stick of bread in my hands. Warm, fresh, aromatic, and magical. This was probably the best dollar I have ever spent. I could eat ten of these probably. It  sounds like this place isn't all that great for other stuff but I can at least tell you to stop in and grab a baguette, you won't be disappointed. Hell it would be against the laws of physics and the natural world for you not to like these baguettes. Go now. Run on over to Chinatown of all places, and get yourself some damn delicious bread."}
{"text":"We came back for the same Vietnamese food as before (#11 Asian combo sandwich and bun vermicelli with shredded pork). Disappointedly, the food didn't taste as good as last time. The quality of the food seemed to have dropped off-----tasted a bit funny. Maybe next time I'll  avoid Sunday evenings because the staff handling the food seemed a bit untrustworthy to me."}
{"text":"This place never fails to impress with the sandwiches they serve. I order either the #1 or the #5 without pickled veggies (not a huge fan of pickled veggies).

The bread is usually baked fresh and delicious. The grilled pork and various meats taste great. I also end up ordering the Lychee smoothie with every meal.

Even though you have to pay in cash (they have a on site ATM), it's worth it.

I would seriously give this place a shot if you have not already."}
{"text":"TLDR: 24 hours; $0.25 surcharge between 9p-5a; $10 minimum credit purchase; bahn mi and euro sandwiches

Lee's Sandwiches in Las Vegas? Why wasn't this thought of earlier? This restaurant prides itself on euro-asian sandwiches, but boasts its foundation from Southern California. There are a couple of differences between the ones in SoCal compared to the one here in Vegas so I'll share my experience below.

There is a quarter charge for purchasing after 9pm. WTF. Really? This just makes me laugh. Anything to get by in this economy I guess. I would've just restricted the menu to save money in that regard. I purchased the same thing I always get: #5 Grilled Pork Asian Sandwich and it's a whopping 710 calories according to their website. I enjoy the combination of flavors from the mixed, pickled vegetables to the cooked meats. The roof of my mouth often gets scraped from the hard bread, but I guess I can just take smaller bites.

My service late at night was generally positive. The communication between the foodservice workers need to improve, but generally a smile during the drunken hours goes a long way. 

All-in-all I would return. My experience was not spectacular, but it was consistent. I would recommend, as long as you can get over the smell."}
{"text":"Yum!  Fresh baguettes make these so special.  We like the Vietnamese sauces an French flair.  Always so clean and fast, making this a good go to for lunch."}
{"text":"The best thing about Lee's is that its open 24 hours. They have a large menu, so there's plenty to choose from...
Sandwiches, che(viet desserts), smoothies, coffee, eggrolls, pok buns, and etc...

Fast casual spot. You won't be served here so don't expect that. 

They're are located in a busy plaza of Chinatown so parking might be difficult during the the dinner rush. 
They only accept cash, which is ridiculous. There is an ATM on the side of the restaurant, but to have to pull out money from an ATM and pay a fee for a 3 dollar sandwich upsets me and most probably. 

Great place for a quick snack in Chinatown. Might not be the best place for Vietnamese sandwiches in Vegas, but they are so convenient that I don't see them going anywhere anytime soon. It's upsetting because I'm from San Jose and grew up on Lee's Sandwiches, and this just doesn't cut it.

Their cafe sua da is amazing. They put way too much ice in it so you might want to wait til it melts a bit...pretty thick otherwise."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed when I found out they raised the price. I come here every year or two for the past 3 years from out of state. When they were only around $3 I would buy alot and bring them home to share with the family but now it's almost $5 for a sandwich. That's ridiculous for a banh mi. I always get the special combination banh mi and ask them to toast it up or warm in the microwave. Yes, it's suppose to be a cold sandwhich but I love when it's warm because the bread is soft and the pate/mayo get really creamy. Try it next time! My bread was hard. It wasn't from toasting it because I asked them to warm it up 2x and it still wasnt war! The bread was really stale. Now I'll just the banh mi from where I live $3.25. Just not the same bread/pate but still amazing & creamier!"}
{"text":"A food chain nothing more nothing less if you want a quick bite. Expect surcharge as most places in this area do. Food was okay, you find better quality bahn mi sandwiches down the road from here."}
{"text":"The best banh you will ever get in the U.S. with the best iced coffee. Very clean and polite service."}
{"text":"Service is terribly slow, I have been waiting 20 mins just for a smoothie! People who ordered after me are getting their orders first. Bad service"}
{"text":"Café is water down badly.  Looks like it's instant coffee with ice.  Wtf happen here in Vegas Lee's? Your reputation is getting bad.. I had to pour a Red bull into my café to feel the caffeine kick."}
{"text":"Having come from LA with a large Vietnamese community, this is not the same Bahn Mi I'm accustomed to. Heck they couldn't even make a decent vegetarian. 

I will commend them on their clean facilities and quick service however. Oh but if you're an attractive young lady expect some disrespect from the male staff."}
{"text":"I was so excited to learn that they had opened up a Lee's Sandwich in the Henderson area!  This saves me a LONG JOURNEY (*Sarcasm*) to Spring Mountain to get my fix on a Bahn Mi.  

Great location, easy to find parking and the sandwiches taste just the same as it does at the other location.  

Did you know you can order DOUBLE MEAT and EXTRA VEGGIES on your sandwich?  I learned that a couple of months ago and I have been doing it ever since!  haha.  

The only time I had a bad sandwich here was the meat ball sandwich.  When I see meat ball sandwich in an Asian joint, I'm thinking and Asian pork meat balsl!  Well it was basically a failed attempt at making an Asian version of the American meat ball sub. Total fail!  

I'll just stick to my usual grilled chicken and grilled pork subs from now on.  haha."}
{"text":"My Recommendation: hit up Mr. Sandwich around the corner instead lol.

The sandwiches here are good, they're just way over-hyped. The prices are real cheap and the speed at which the prepare your meals is pretty fast. I don't have too much bad to say about this place, I just don't have too much great to say either. It's just \"good\".

I will say that the Avocado Smoothie here tasted like I was drinking liquid cardboard lol."}
{"text":"Good food but I feel like Lee's has gotten pretty pricey over the years. This used to be the go-to place where you could pick up a sandwich for significantly cheaper than american fast food restaurants and now I feel like their prices are quite similar."}
{"text":"Great Turkey and Provolone Sandwich for $4.50 on a fresh French baguette. We tried the baked beignets but sorry not as good as New Orleans. Not hot and not airy at all.
Free WiFi is always a plus. Loved all the fresh pastry. Took home a almond croissant. Yum!"}
{"text":"Very poor sandwich.  Not much meat and pickles. Just long bread and poorly put together with meat and pickles.  One of the worst banh mi sandwich that I have ever had. 
Smoothies were okay except very hard boba. Don't need to go back for banh mi and smoothies."}
{"text":"Fun Fact:  
In 1983, They started serving banh mi, Vietnamese style sandwiches from their catering truck by San Jose State University to the students and residents in the area. It became an instant hit among the community. Wanting to create a more permanent location and expand the franchise in over 3 dozen areas including Las Vegas and Henderson.  They opened the first Lee's Sandwiches location on Santa Clara Street.

In addition to the traditional Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches, they added Euro-style sandwiches, fresh baked baguettes and croissants, an extensive line of drinks including the famous  Lee's Coffee - ca phe sua da and can be expressed in regular, caramel, mocha, or vanilla blends.

Lee's Sandwiches attracts a diverse crowd, from traditional Vietnamese-Americans to a younger crowd, all ethnicities of all ages with the extensive menu that offers a unique dining experience for everyone's preference. 

Lee's Sandwiches is heavily involved with the communities. They have contributed and helped raised additional funds for many tragedies including 9-11, Hurricane Katrina, the floods in Vietnam, earthquakes in Mexico, and other local charities such as donating food and sponsoring various community and non profit events.

As for my experience, I always utilize their space to do my college studies and homework in privacy because they stay open 24 hours and the owner is very supportive of my goals. I sit on the foyer part of the restaurant/ cafe so that I wouldn't take up space on the inside where people could dine. They also have a private room used for events. You can go in and ask if that room can be reserved. 

What I love to order on their menu is #5 - Grilled Pork and #6 - BBQ Pork with extra mayo packets and vinegar on the side. This brings out more flavor and softens up my bread because that's just how I like it. To go with your meal, you cannot skip on their famous coffee. I love it because it's thick, creamy and keeps me awake when I study. 

P.S. Just a heads up, plan on bring in cash to pay for your meals because they have a $10 credit/ debit card minimum to purchase a meal."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spot to chill n on the go....I've try everything on the menu and all of them very good in my taste bud..very convenient in my side of town...thanks"}
{"text":"Service check
Sandwiches are delicious especially adding the butter mayo :) yum! The French style!"}
{"text":"Fast, inexpensive, and super tasty. Bring cash. Lee's Sandwiches is a no frills, tasty gem on the Southeast corner of Warner and Dobson.

The atmosphere is very clean with no frills table seating. You order at the counter and wait for your number to be called.

For the uninitiated, Vietnamese sandwiches are a wonderful mélange of French and Vietnamese cuisines. The super fresh & warm baguettes are baked on site and will make you and your taste buds soar. 

They also have Euro sandwiches. I hear they are quite good. But I can't stray from my dear Banh Mi... so good, so, so good. 

Lee's offerings are all over the map. I already spoke on the sandwiches, but they also have appetizers, Ice Cream, and fantastic Pastries. Folks also seem to go nuts for the eggrolls. I like them fine, but others regard them as crack-level addictive. Give 'em a shot.

Lee's Sandwiches is why I always bring a cooler for my perishables when I shop at Lee Lee's across the street. A Banh Mi is my post grocery shopping tradition."}

I had the BBQ Pork, which was good but the Pork was a little dry.  I love the pickled Vietnamese veggies that are on the Sandwich....as well as the Cilantro and Jalapeno....that's what makes these so good in my opinion.  The Baguette was perfect....nothing like good bread to make a Sandwich.

Overall, it was a good lunch....would've scored higher if the Pork wasn't dry.

Bad things: the restaurant it was kinda dirty."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, sandwiches. That sums it up. Service is pretty fast, but bring cash. They don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Please, \"banh mi with lots of thit\" ----just checking your sense of humor, if you don't get it... well.... that's too bad....one of the greatest one liner I will ever use.

Grilled pork, baguettes, Lee's coffee - my usual pattern when ordering.  I occasionally throw in whatever selections that is good they have on display.    I highly reccommend  those three items.

Very clean and big location., the biggest I have ever seen.  A lot of chairs and tables set up, there's even chairs and tables outside for the smokers--- nothing like a sandwhich , a cup of Lee's coffee and some proteins for your lungs. yummmm

  If ever I feel like my gas tank need to be emptied then I drive to Lee's Sandwhiches.  East siders- be grateful for this sandwhich shop!  

4 stars for the food and the cleanliness of the restaurant.

Please don't expect good service here,  I have not experienced it."}
{"text":"I come here every so often and order chicken and a smoothy. My last experience here was truly sickening!  After drinking most of the drink, I found a long strand of hair in my Avacado Smoothy Boba! Manager refused to give me a refund and instead offer me another smoothy. Like I would want another smoothy after finding raw hair inside of it?!?! After having this experience I doubt I'll ever come here again..."}
{"text":"Very HIGH - TECH and HIGH - END Lee's Sandwich than the one's I'm used to. They have a large amount of seating available and I like it. It's very clean and modern looking.

They'll have frozen yogurt soon!! And they offer you some yummy samples when you walk in. Very nice... it's a great place to grab some food off the strip and and even get some \"to go\" for after your nightlife activities.

**If you take a cab here, make sure you get their dispatch taxi number, so you can get a cab back!!!"}
{"text":"I've come to Lee's sandwiches before for my fix of Vietnamese iced coffee and it's perfect every time! This time was no different!
This was however my first time at this location and I loved how open it was when we first walked in! They have extra seating away from the main restaurant area and it's furnished with plants and Asian inspired animal statues. I went with my Vietnamese mother in law and was told to touch the frog for luck!
In the main restaurant they have your choice of seats and booths, drink fridges to help yourself and cute merchandise against the wall. The screens also show all their drinks - they have their own boba drinks too now which I haven't seen before!
Aside from the coffees, we ordered a BBQ pork banh mi and a combination and they were both delicious!! The bread was warm and soft but crunchy on the outside. There was a good amount of meat in both and the veggies and the sauce inside were a great complement to both.
I was so impressed and would definitely stop by here for some lunch and my beloved ca phe sua da again!"}

{"text":"Best banh mi sandwich in Arizona. Wish I lived closer, but it is worth the trip on the weekend for a delicious, fresh, authentic banh mi. French horns are to die for, get there when they open and they will still be a little warm. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Roasted pork sandwich hits the spot every time I'm craving a sandwich.  For about $4 you get a foot long sandwich.  Thinner than a Subway sandwich, but the taste of the roasted pork can't compare to packaged cold cuts.

I would have never expected a vietnamese sandwich place to have the BEST ICED COFFEE!!!!!!  A little expensive compared to Starbucks, but again the taste it so worth paying $1 more.  If you like coffee, you HAVE TO try their coffee!"}
{"text":"The good news:  A good sandwich for the price - $3.79.  Quick service, tons of choices.  The baguette is crispy and fresh.  The ingredients are good.  The bad news:  skimpy on the meat and goodies inside.  Consider doubling up your meat if you are very hungry.  The pork banh mi is the most popular.
There is one veggie banh mi too."}
{"text":"Iced Coffee is always right on point! Strong and delicious. The only thing I think needs improvement is the amount of ice they put into it. I ordered coffee with ice, not ice with a splash of coffee. Less ice please!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars!? 

I've been to the one in Irvine, California since I went to undergrad there and loved it!! I was ecstatic  when this one opened up locally! I think this will be the next subway =). 

I must admit that I was discouraged when I yelped it and it only returned 2.5 stars. Anyhow, I decided to go see for myself and this place BIG!! LED TV's everywhere (march madness anyone?), great ambiance, very clean and modern design. Probably the nicest Lee's. The line was a bit long, and i was expecting to wait about 30 mins from reading other user reviews but it took about 5-10 mins which was decent  given the amount of people there. I ordered the Ham and cheese croissant and an Iced coffee. The Ham and Cheese was huge and delicious. No complaints there. I don't understand why people are complaining about the iced coffee...It's the same at all the Lee's. It's VIETNAMESE iced coffee. It's condensed so the ice is meant to melt and dilute the coffee...duh. It's not meant to be gulped. Maybe the Iced coffee should come with instructions ha ha.

Never the less, the coffee is very addicting. I ended up buying one of those bottles that you can keep in the freezer so I can drink it through out the week. 

I haven't tried one of those fresh made pasteries or the patay sho thingy's. I'll try it on my next visit. 

Free WIFI is always good. I'm Planning to use it as a study spot since it's 24/7! whoo hoo!

I wish it had a drive thru.

I see a frozen yogurt bar opening up in the near future! 

Overall a very nice place. I hope it's safe to study there at night. Is there a security guard!? ha ha"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is open 24 hours. I usually get a banh mi, but the bread is usually hard. It tastes way different from when they are freshly made. They also sell boba here as well, and those are affordable. There is a large variety of different flavors, but it definitely does not beat a boba shop that specializes in boba. I believe they use powder for their flavors, which isn't ideal but still tastes decent."}
{"text":"I always visit Lee's in San Francisco & Irvine in CA. Gave this location a shot & purchased my go to Thai Milk Tea. Wish I tried it before leaving because the drink was SPOILED! Drink may have been left overnight because the cup contained clumps of creamer & left sour taste in my mouth. Lee's, please fix this!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Very clean  Free wifi! But very bad drinks. Got a thai tea boba, and they might as well given me the tea from the bottle at ranch market."}
{"text":"Very cheap good eats. My favorite is the vietnamese meatball sandwich. 

They also have a wide variety of smoothies. The avocado is, um, interesting.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"For something quick, affordable and good quality, Lee's just can't be beat! I'm so glad they have one here in Las Vegas / Henderson.

Grilled pork banh mi combo with egg rolls and a drink for $5.99 just can't be beat!

And I get to plug in my laptop and do a bit of work in a nice, clean environment while I'm at it."}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews, I was surprised by the results. I had a great experience during my visit. 

I've been to the Lee's Sandwich in Chandler many times, more times than my hands can count and comparing their Chandler location to our recently opened up Arrowhead location wouldn't be fair. But already I feel there are many perks to this location that the Chandler location does not have. 

For one, credit card and debit card transactions! That's already a huge bonus. I can't exaggerate how many times I had to use the ATM machine in Chandler because I didn't have cash or enough cash for that matter. 

Two, the drive-thru line which isn't open yet but coming soon! Another great feature especially in the location! Many doctors, offices, clinics around. People here need fast and ready to go service!

I know the other reviews state they ran out of stuff and the staff aren't friendly but I didn't have any problems. I came opening week and my experience was still pleasant. I ordered two sandwiches, two iced coffees, an almond croissant, and an order of hot wings. All were great. My only downfall was that their baguettes are slightly smaller than the Chandler location Lee's. But service wise, I even had a worker come up and ask me and my friend how everything was. 

Excited to see the growth of this Arrowhead location Lee's Sandwich! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I came here a good handful of times before I actually found something that was good. When it first opened, because of the excitement  I came here 2 or 3 times in hopes of finding something good from this Viet chain. Unfortunately I gave up and never looked back. Oh wait, never say never? I recently visited due to the fact my friend and I had a night out and had the late night munchies, but we were on a budget. Oh hey, why not Lee's since it's cheap and its open at 2 in the morning. 

Grilled Pork Bahn Mi- mmm! nice flavor on the pork. the spread was also tasty and I'm actually a fan of what most people refer to as their \"super hard bread.\" I just love that crunch! The veggies could of used a little bit more work because they were just 'blah.' Overall I really liked it especially for the size and price. But I mean most Bahn Mi places can't mess up on the signature grilled pork sandwich. Highly recommend this and nothing else. 

Vietnamese Coffee- my first time drinking viet coffee, made me kinda anxious since I heard a few stories about it. Pretty good and in my first few sips I tasted as if it had a hint of alcohol  flavor. I wanted more, but I ordered the smaller size not knowing about it's deliciousness. 

The other things that I ordered in the past and didn't satisfy my pallet. 

Sardine Banh Mi- the veggies were even worse my first time around. Especially the cilantro which was pretty much wilted. I didn't really taste the spread nor see it either. Let's just say this sandwich was sort of a disaster... And this was my first Lee's experience. Obviously not giving me a good first impression. 

Coconut waffle- this looked really delicious with it being a bight green color and all. I just had to order it because it was looking me in the eye as I was waiting in line to order. Unfortunately it was super soggy with an ok coconut flavor. Kinda disappointed it didn't live up to what I had hoped for. 

Beignets- once again it looked delicious under the heating lamps in the display case. UGH wrong... I wasn't really fond of the texture. I feel like it was lacking something, probably sweetness. Once again something I do not recommend. 

Although I did enjoy the girlled pork banh mi, it doesn't make up for all the miss haps for all their other products. Plus, I'll only go here for my bahn mi fix if it's another one of those late night munchies kinda thing. Therefore, 2 star rating- sorry!"}
{"text":"Cafe sua da is a must try! If you're a coffee addict you'll love the nutty strong taste to it. Also their banh mi dac biet \"special sandwich\" is delicious!!! So much better than many places! Only Vietnamese sandwich place I'll go to in Vegas! Mmmmmm mm!"}
{"text":"I love this place.

Where else can you get a cheap ($3-$4) Vietnamese sandwiches in Arizona? There are a bunch of chains in California, but this is the only one in AZ. 

I usually get the combo or the BBQ pork sandwhich with a Jackfruit smoothie. (Delicious!) 

I give 5 stars for the value and taste alone!
Plus they got a lot of seats and make creme filled custards and other Asian bakery items."}
{"text":"The food is good. Not super amazing, but it's good lunch food, and a favorite for most locals. The bread is always perfect when I eat at any of the locations. Lots of drink and boba options. They even have asian grocery snacks that you can buy. Prices are decent, I think, for the quality. 

The restaurant itself is really nice. It's spacious and bright and usually always clean. If you need to go somewhere to hang out or kill time, it's a good alternative to Starbucks."}
{"text":"Good place and good food. I always order the #11 combo and it's great every time. I always get their mango smoothie with boba and it's perfectly sweet. Definitely will go again and again."}
{"text":"Oh Lee's why must you take my money and fill me with joy.. 

Same great quality and flavor only right next door to my house! Location is much smaller than others with a small dining area but who cares this is the best quick take out to his the southwest part of Vegas! I have a feeling that I will be in here quite frequently. Hey it's better than McDonald's! 

Give me that crack iced coffee!"}
{"text":"I wanted to consume less carbs so I politely asked if they wouldn't mind digging out the insides of the banh mi, and I found out that this is actually a common request! Result is a crunchy and thin grilled pork banh mi with less guilt! Iced Vietnamese coffee is a must too. 

My biggest complaint is that they only accept cash. This ain't garden grove! And you're a filthy rich multi million dollar company. YOU CAN AFFORD TO PAY YOUR RIGHTFUL AMOUNT OF TAXES SO STOP INCONVENIENCING ME AND EVERYBODY ELSE"}
{"text":"Service was fast, bbq pork was ok, but nothing bothers me more than taking 4 good sips of your drink and seeing nothing but ice. Cold world. Lol never again."}
{"text":"Mine and my wife's favourite go to place when ever we are in Vegas.  We usually come here because it's a nice break from all the buffets. 
The subs doesn't make you feel sick after eating it and the vietnamese coffee is the yummiest!"}
{"text":"I feel as if i've been forever tainted by Hue Thai b/c
I wasn't impressed with Lee's one bit.

My first impression on entering the store is that there
is a smell, a bad smell, that lingers the entire time
you're in there. You would think after a few minutes you 
would get used to it and wouldnt notice. Not here in Lee's.

If that wasn't bad the smell followed us all the way to 
home while the sandwiches were in the car. We seriously
had to roll the window down. I thought I was being 
dramatic until my co-pilot stated she was refusing to eat
hers for fear it tasted like it smelled.

I was able to venture in but wasnt wow'd.
The bread was ok but the meat was skimpy.. even for 
most bahn mi standards. 

Meh... kind of sums it up perfectly.."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in town, which is every two weeks. I always get the same, after trying most of the sandwiches. I get the grilled pork sandwich and 3 egg rolls.

I don't recommend the white folks sandwiches though.

On occasion I have bought loafs of their freshly baked baguettes.
This place is cash only. They recently upped the prices on their sandwiches by $0.20, that won't stop me from coming.

Lee's also offer pastries and ice cream.

I'll be coming until my wife finally gets done with school. I won't miss Phoenix, but I will miss Lee's!"}
{"text":"Been dealing with some heartburn lately but wanted to take my family out for our day off together. Ended up at Lee's and it was a delight. My lovely girlfriend had the house combo and said it was light refreshing and delicious. The spring rolls were quite tasty for her and my son too. I had a turkey sandwich and glad I did. The bread was fresh and just right. The mayo gave it the right touch of moisture and flavor. The people were nice and friendly and I enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you notice the vibrantly new modern decor. Wanted to order three times the amount of food that I did order. Held back and will live to fight another day. Tried the Bahn Mi chicken sandwich and an avocado boba smoothie. Sandwich had great flavor, but the chicken was a bit dry. The French bread is what really set the sandwich off. So delicious! The avocado smoothie had good flavor. However, drinking this smoothie was equivalent to taking a giant swig of olive oil. So rich and heavy it kind of sat wrong in my stomach. Customer service was helpful and friendly. Can't wait to try other menu items."}
{"text":"As a kid, growing up with Lee's sandwiches ALWAYS meant my family and I were going on a trip. Long road trips to California, eating these sandwiches in between rest stops with my family are memories I always cherish. Not only that, it was the go-to meal whenever we went somewhere. Heading off to the airport? Lee's Sandwiches. Going to the beach? Lee's Sandwiches, Disneyland? You bet your butts we packed a bundle of Lee's Sandwiches. Now that one opened on my side of town, I'm always giddy to stop by and grab one of their deliciously-filled baguette sandwiches. I think that's their secret to success- their freshly-made baguettes. I swear, I could eat a whole loaf of it if I could! I ordered a veggie avocado baguette sandwich and although it's not the same as their traditional Asian sandwiches, it still delivers with quality! As usual, their baguettes were nice and crispy where you can hear a crunch as you bite into the bread itself, and being a veg head, I loved all of the bunch of veggies they stuffed in there!"}
{"text":"Lee's is known for their French baguette Vietnamese sandwiches and is definitely worth trying if you want to explore other sandwich options that aren't your typical ham, turkey, beef meats, etc. which they serve here as well.

I was in the area and knew they opened up a new Lee's Sandwich in Peoria so I decided to stop by to see if it's similar to the one in Chandler, along with ordering my usual - #11 (banh mi dac biet) and hot wings.

Upon arriving, the actual building is significantly smaller than Chandler's location and I noticed it did not have any other customers in there. I browsed the store and it appeared to have the same menu though, except there is no sugar cane drink. Trust me, I asked! On the bright side, they do accept cards instead of cash only and are currently doing a promotion where you receive a discount if you come wearing your work clothes or work ID badge on weekdays from 11-1pm (I hope I remembered the time right). The staff was friendly and informed me on all this without me even asking.

Another perk is you receive an iced coffee for 0.99 upon checking in. The coffee was strong, as Vietnamese coffee should be but it definitely did not taste the same as I normally get in Chandler, it had both types of ice in there which was odd...full sized ice cubes on the bottom and crushed ice on top. It tasted like they accidentally put too much condensed milk inside. My banh mi was tasty and the bread was actually softer than normal which is a good thing! The banh mi dac biet has liver pate, jelly meats, and appears odd but if you grew up eating it like me, it's the best! It comes with pickled veggies, jalapeños, cilantro, and onions to balance the flavors. The hot wings are my favorite at Lee's though, it's not really spicy at all even though it says hot, there is no sauce on it, just crispy breading, and it's salty but I love that it's salty so if you don't mind that, get it.

One star off because of no sugar cane drink.
One star off because the ice coffee flavor was off and the unusual ice cubes.
3 stars out of 5!"}
{"text":"tried this place out from a recommendation from a friend n i got to say its pretty good prices are reasonable baguettes are freshly made there , plus side is that there open 24 hours draw back if you go during lunch ur going to be waiting a while in line!..but pretty much a good lunch spot if your around the china town area"}
{"text":"Definitely not as good as the ones in Cali, but it's not too bad. There are plenty of other choices for bahn mi around town but its not too bad. I've only ever been here at night. I like their Italian sodas. The sandwiches are decent, I've had better, but it's not bad. I would actually rather eat the sandwiches after I get them home and microwave it because the bread gets so much softer."}
{"text":"Best bread in AZ!! You can buy the whole loaf for only $1.39.  I love the Pork Bahn Mi sandwiches.  The staff doesnt seem to speak fluent English so just know what you want when you go there. This is the same as the Lee's in Las Vegas which was voted best sandwiches.  This isnt your typical sandwich place meaning dont expect to get LOADS OF MEAT. Its VIETNAMESE, they dont eat meat like Americans do.  Anyway, I love the flavors of the pickled veg and would even just eat that any without meat.  Its only $4.75 including tax for a 10 inch Bahn mi. Cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"Lee's is basically McDonald's to me. You know what you're getting and they are always open. 

Plus now they have churros?! When a Vietnamese sandwich shop starts making churros you know heaven is real."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem eating here at Lees. The atmosphere is always lively and clean. For the most part service is pretty fast except when there's 10ppl in line. I would recommend ordering extra meat if you want your sandwich more full & flavorful. The bread is fresh and portion size is big and veggies are yummy. All the other snacks & goodies look delicious too. The iced coffee is good but way too much ice. For a place to sit & eat with friends this is the best spot. Now they accept credit cards too with a minimum purchase."}
{"text":"Heck yes! 
Great food, great price, I saw the reviews on yelp so I decided to check it out. 
I wish I lived near this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here to buy coffee and the bbq sandwich for many years. I love how affordable the sandwiches are, I think a lot of em are less than $5. Their bread is really good. The coffee is amazing but they could offer a larger cup for the size L and LESS ice too, it seems like it's more ice than coffee. 1 star off for the bathroom though because it always seems like it's dirty and the floor has not been mopped."}
{"text":"MAAAAAAAAAAAAN. Why you let me down Lee??

Came here for boba. They've got a buy 2 get 1 free deal. I attempted to do it and she forgot my second boba. When I asked her about it she said its too late for me to do the deal since it wasn't on the original order. Alright. No worries. So I asked her if I could just order the second one she missed, she said okay, and took my order. BUT WAIT. No more boba. She seemed so dismissive and annoyed. Then when I asked if I could just wait for a new batch, she said something in Spanish to her coworker and said I could if I wanted to wait 30 minutes. 

Amazing. Purely amazing. Your complete lack of customer service is so welcoming. Your urgency to make a sale and retain customers is definitely providing you with a thriving business. 

So here I go, on my way home, with no boba... :'("}
{"text":"Main spot for bahn Minh. This place is cash only! I love the pork roll sandwich and Vietnamese iced coffee. They also have a great selection of Asian/French pantry items to stock up on as well. Very friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a sandwich in town !  The croissant club is my favorite.  The bread is always fresh.  Fast and friendly service.  Beware of the PA system, its pretty funny.  Also, bring cash.  Cheers"}
{"text":"This place was not quite the ending lunch I wanted to grab before leaving Vegas.

Food: Banh mi - Taste is decent but way too little filling. Not enough herbs and the do chua is cut too big. And they put peas in it. Who puts peas in banh mi ? ! 
Coffee - cafe sua da. I wonder if they think I'm so blind that I wouldn't see that 90% of the cup was ice. The taste was good but really a rip-off for what you get.

Service: Good nice people... who skimps on food unfortunately.

Setting: clean big nice place... that skimps on food

So yea, please avoid this place if you don't want to start hating Vietnamese banh mi."}
{"text":"Their name makes them underrated for how many things they sell here. The sandwiches are excellent because the bread from their bakery is so fresh. I don't mind buying the day old bread. I put it in the freezer and it lasts for a week after. One day I will try their smoothies."}
{"text":"Always pleased with the friendly service. And I never have to wait long! I had my first Taro smoothie here and am hooked! I'm so glad the staff recommended it. Thank you! Will most definitely be back"}
{"text":"Solid four stars.  Really fresh bread, low prices, delicious grilled pork and excellent staff.

The place is a little off turning to the eyes, very neon and gaudy, but the sandwiches are right on the money.  Not the best Grilled Pork Sam I've had, but up there and definitely worth the drive and the $2.50 is costs.

It is one of my American dreams for Lee's Sandwiches to replace every McDonalds in America.  Now to replace Olive Garden with Oreganos..."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave such high stars is because of one person's customer service. I work graveyard, and wondered in around 3:30am in the morning looking for coffee. Their sandwiches are awful. So, many better choices in town. But Jonathan has made the experience less painful. He turned me to epoxy app to redeem the rest of my punch card. He made me realize that too get a stronger coffee, you pay extra for espresso and NOT size. They just water it down. So, if you come across a Jonathan at 3am, be nice to him. He'll be nice to you!"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is somewhat legendary in the realm of Las Vegas bahn mi.  They're open around the clock and at midnight we were craving some of that savory, pickled and fresh veggie goodness on a light crisp baguette.  What we got was strange spreads (not pate) on bread that had tough, chewy edges like it had been reheated by microwave.  We couldn't find cilantro on the sandwiches at all.  We both felt a little ill in our stomaches after eating which we deduced to be food poisoning or the feeling extreme disappointment."}
{"text":"Let me start off by explaining why my review lacks the 5th star.  No doubt, the bread here is good tasting; but it is so hard and never fails to scratch the roof of my mouth!

Any way, my favorite sandwiches here are the Special Combination of course, and when I feel like I need to be good about my diet, the grilled chicken is my best bet.  I love to get extra cilantro and peppers!  

My favorite side dish here are the sesame balls.  I can eat like 10 of them!

My favorite drink here is there Cafe Sua.  Strong, sweet, and gives you that coffee high if you like it!

This is my go to spot for a nice cheap lunch!  Great prices for great food!

{"text":"Food was great!! Found this place by accident while looking for food trucks.  Lots on the menu to choose from,from Asian to Euro sandwiches, churros,steamed buns, and fried chicken. Baguette reminded me of being back on Germany.  
One bothersome item os the $20 limit to not get charged a fee."}
{"text":"Oh heck yeah!
-Lee's sandwiches for all your bahn mi faire
-It's good!
-But then again, I am a big fan of Lee's anyways
-They have wi-fi and lots of space to study
-outlets...ooo not too many. There's one by the waterfall wall.

Come here if you want: to get a cheap filler up, to get Vietnamese/Asian snacks, somewhere open 24 hours 
Do not come here if: you need an outlet to charge devices, you hate semi-shady strip malls, you're looking for a robust bahn mi"}
{"text":"So, i was craving Vietnamese coffee.  I asked no ice in my coffee.  And this is what they give me... (please see the pic I upload).

Really? 6 oz only?!?!?!!!! WTF!!!  

Oh, their sandwiches taste like poop too...."}
{"text":"Wow SO I came here today and it was amazing. The service was friendly and the sandwich was the most amazing sandwich I have ever had. The baguette was soo FRESH. I even got one to take home for $1.50. The crunch of the bread and cold fresh veggies along with BBQ pork, house mayo and cilantro was just the most amazing combination. I also got an iced coffee that had way too much ice in it but the coffee was out of this world. I'd probably just ask for light ice next time. I will most deffinatley be back!"}
{"text":"Pros: They have some of the freshest sandwiches around, and they are even cheaper (and healthier) than the nasty $5 foot long subs at Subway. Lees serves both Asian and American sandwiches as well as pastries, breads, ice scream and delicious drinks. Some of the best foods here are their pastries, so definitely try their croissants, muffins and beignets. Their sandwiches are served either on croissants or french bread (whichever you prefer).  I love their grilled chicken sandwich.

Cons: This is a CASH ONLY place so make sure you have that handy or else you have to use the generic ATM (with fees). 

Also, try their iced coffee. It's amazing!  But make sure you ask them to go easy on the ice because they like to fill the entire cup full of ice while only giving you a little bit of coffee. Im always done in about 2 sips, so my trips have been better since I asked for them to hold the ice a bit."}
{"text":"Is there a 0 stars?  We visited here after reading the reviews and having tried the LA store.  My mom and I ordered the grilled pork baguette and the salami/cheese.   I also ordered the house iced coffee.   The order came up quick.  We were excited..... Then we opened the grilled pork sandwich to take the onions off and to our surprise there was only a few pieces of fatty meat on the whole 10 inch sandwich.  My mom took the sandwich up to the front and the first gentleman told my mom they weigh the meat and that's all you get.  Then my mom spoke with the manager and she said the same thing.... We weigh the meat and it has 2.4 oz, then she proceeded to take the sandwich and weigh it!  She offered a refund but never offered to add more meat.  Then she came to our table and explained again that the sandwich is \"only\" 3 dollars and we weigh the meat blah blah!  Then she said she would get in trouble if she added more meat and they have to keep their costs down.  Seriously???  Maybe if you would make the sandwich with a normal amount of meat you would have more business and make more money???!  Business 101!!!  I wish I would have taken a photo....  
Btw my iced coffee was good but they filled it 2-3 inches from the top:(.  One star for fast service and clean environment.... 0 stars for customer service and CHEAPSKATE mentality!!!!"}
{"text":"I like their veg bhan mi :) they only take cash so bring ur bucks. Cheap and yummy food if ur Asian in az u probably came here millions of times .    This place sells regular French sandwiches but you mainly come here for Asian goodies .

I am so in love with their spicy chicken wings I'm actually addicted. I don't think it's healthy at all but salty and spicy and delicious junk food!

All Asian sandwich has pickled radish carrot , jalapeño and ciantro, so if you don't like what I named you would not enjoy them .    Their Vietnamese coffee wakes me up too!"}
{"text":"This is how fast food would be done in an ideal world. Baguettes hot out of the oven (for one buck!). Fresh, delicious banh mi starting at $2.50. Definitely have the Vietnamese-style sandwiches, not the American ones. The perfect inexpensive, light lunch."}
{"text":"FINALLY tried banh mi, and it was really good!
The place was empty at 6:00 on a Thursday evening (literally, we were the only ones in there), so we got our sandwiches pretty quick. 
I ordered the bbq pork banh mi for ~$3.75 and my husband got the 'european' roast beef for ~$5.75. First off, I would not order any of the 'European' sandwiches because they come with very little meat and American (!) cheese. Definitely not worth the higher price. However, I really enjoyed my banh mi, and would definitely go back for the lunch special (includes 2 mini egg rolls and a drink for like $5.50). The baguettes were really good and the meat was not too fatty (which is the problem I usually have with Asian meats). 
The inside of the shop is really clean - like a modern-style fast food joint. The drink selection is pretty good; typical fountain drinks, plus a couple big coolers full of Asian sodas/bottled coffees/teas.
Minus points for filling the fountain sodas in the back and not offering free refills - this is 2013!
Weird note: it's actually cheaper to get the combo (with side and drink) than it is to just get the sandwich and a side...."}
{"text":"Where's all the thugs?!  

If the first door wasn't enough, you'll have to enter through a second door to get inside.  Came here opening night just to get check it out.  Ordered a banh mi for the sake of it because well, it's Lee's. I couldn't think of any other reason than trying to relived the past, but those days are over and i rather support our local store than a chain.

I admit i was a little excited anticipating their opening, and now that they are i'm all ready over it.  It's Lee's: standard food for decent price.  I see a froyo station coming soon.  People still eat froyo?  White tiles for the floors and they're already abused on opening night.

I wonder if their croissant sammiches are still ginormous.  Ah, who cares? It's Lee's."}
{"text":"Just moved here from California and it just felt like home to come to a Lee's and get Thai tea and a bbq pork banh mi. SO FREAKING GOOD"}
{"text":"\"Fresh\" Hot Baguette, Croissant!!  OMG 
But when their are not fresh is like regular bread in the market 
Recently try salami sandwich and don't remember pork one excellent"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for coffee. The place has a great interior. Its a market, coffee shop and deli.The coffee was very good yet a little too sweet. However, there is a $5 requirement for purchases while using a card. The cashier also informed me that they charge a .50 tax which I thought was interesting."}
{"text":"Great simple sandwiches with a great price tag. Good size too. The cash only is alarming but its inexpensive enough that you could probably pull out enough change from your ashtray!"}
{"text":"This place has the cheapest sandwiches. $4 and change gets you a sandwich. And not a tiny one. A decently sized one. You'd have a hard time beating that. Unless you only have a credit card on you. Then there's a $10 minimum. Bring cash. 

The sandwiches are okay. The bread is delicious. It's great they give you so much of it. What goes inside the bread is less impressive. They usually go a bit skimpy on the meat and they put a ton of accouterments in there like cilantro and bean sprouts. It helps fill the sandwich but sometimes wish there was a bit more substance.

The real issue with Lee's is with their drinks. Their coffee drinks, or anything they put ice in, is a total rip off. I've been to this location before and I have had to specifically tell them to lay off the ice. The cup is filled to the brim with tiny ice, so you get a few sips of drink. Honestly, I think it's cheap. You pay four bucks for an iced coffee and you get a cup of ice. Also, when I told them to lay off on the ice, the guy who took my order looked like I was crazy. Maybe they don't know that it's garbage to fill a drink to the brim with ice. Maybe it's just how they were told to make those drinks. It's horrible though. Don't order a drink that has any ice in it, unless you actually just wanted coffee flavored ice.  That's one thing I really wish Lee's would change. 

Bread is great, sandwiches are good in a bind, avoid drinks as they rip you off."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are pretty good. The ambience is nice and they have excellent customer service. Their smoothies are good too. I've had the durian smoothie, but I'm not sure if they use the actual fruit or if it's just a powder/syrup flavor. 

Don't get their, \"freshly squeezed sugar cane juice.\" It's nothing compared to the fresh ones found in LA. I got a large cup yesterday and it was disgusting. I let my mom try it and she said it might have been made with a powder mix. Regardless, they should get a better mix!"}
{"text":"I ordered 9 number 11 on May 21st around 9pm. I brought the Banh Mi home and store them in the refrigerator, so me and my friends (total of 6) can bring them to eat on the trip to San Diego the next morning.I dont really know which one is wrong,the pate or the butter but 3 of us got diarrhea,and the others feel sick/dizzy/Vomiting on the stomach,we have to stop 5 times for bathrooms on the way and that is a disaster. I will never never come here again!
We didn't eat anything from 7am to 2pm on the way to San Diego. Their food are the only thing we ate. If you travel somewhere do not eat that shit or it gonna be a nightmare. It tooks us 7 hours to go to San Diego and ruined out trip."}
{"text":"What I love most about Lee's is that they are open at 8am! 
I know it's too early for Vietnamese sandwiches at breakfast, so I drive by in the morning, and stash the sandwiches for lunch. 

I customize my sandwich, and order a grilled chicken, add grilled pork with extra vegetables. It's the perfect combination of meat, vege and bread. The normal version is too bready for me. 

The sandwiches are better fresh, as the French bread is soft with a fresh baked crust out of the oven. The longer you let the sandwich/bread sit, the harder it gets. I suggest eating immediately if you can.

There's a buy 5 get the 6th complimentary offer. My office appreciates this offer :) Sandwiches for everyone!"}
{"text":"I know this place is new and need to work out the kinks so I will try again. But for this visit, the staff was confused and looked flustered so maybe they needed more training. 

The grilled chicken sandwich with extra veges I ordered was lacking the extra vege and I thought did not have enough grilled chicken. The fresh French roll was ok but I would have like mine to be a little more baked with a nice brownish hue, not beige.

I'm not crazy about the layout with the fro-yo on the right, deli section on the left and ordering in the middle. It doesn't seem to flow. 

I also do not like that this place is so franchise now. I mean they even sell their own mayo-like spread. 

Omg, did Tony say that there will be slot machines?! Doesn't seem very family friendly next to the fro-yo machines."}
{"text":"#4 wasnt tooo shabby(chicken sandwhich) would like varitety breads instead of the classic sourdough price was cheap!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are awesome.  The bread is crunchy and chewy.  Grilled pork sandwich is awesome.  The meat, veggies, and jalapeños are tasty!

And now for the bad:
1) For goodness sakes wipe some tables!  Everytime I've been there all the tables are filthy!  
2) The CC policy is silly... Nothing less than $10.  
3) No sriracha, hosin, or any sauces available.
4) Stop parading the Hillary Clinton was here poster... Makes me not want go in!"}
{"text":"interesting little deli. good variety and fresh sandwiches. prices were decent and so was the serive."}
{"text":"So happy another location opened in my area so I don't need to drive to Chinatown to get my favorite banh mi or baguettes. I usually call in advance and find out when the next batch of banh mi are coming out so I can order two with the Pate. I would recommend the banh mi and Pate and the steam buns."}
{"text":"Just stopped by because I'm craving for good banh mi and an avocado smoothie. Still very delicious and fulfilling. The place was very clean and the staff was very pleasant. I ordered a box of my daughter's favorite cream pastries so she can have after school tomorrow. She would eat the whole box each time she comes to Lees. Kinda sad the Lees near my house isn't open 24/7."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, I love the BBQ pork and Grilled pork. But the cashier, Giselle, was rude to me. She almost threw my change at me, and she acted like I wasn't a valued customer. 2 stars lost for that, sorry. 

Update:

Just left Lee's again and I have an even more sour taste in my mouth. Giselle yet again was rude, and literally threw the bag of sandwiches at me and acted like her customers weren't important. She also said something like \"when I get fired, I'm gonna beat her ass.\" what kind of a person says that infront of customers? Disgusting. Is it really hard to be a polite employee? Or do you just want your business to suffer? Shaking my damn head. Lost another star because of her"}
{"text":"I am so pissed today that I got to write this review! I usually don't write bad reviews since I understand that running a business is hard and nobody wants to upset a customer, sometimes thing just happens beyond control or out of misunderstanding or miscommunication. But what happened today was not beyond control, was not because miscommunication or misunderstanding, it was just unacceptable! I brought my two young kids (1&3) to Lee's Sandwich today wanting them try out Manjoo for the first time. I have always been to Lee's for Their sandwiches and bought Manjoo several times for my office staff. When I was making the purchase, I specifically asked the cashier, a young man with glasses, that if these Manjoo I am purchasing is freshly made today (no date on box, just two numbers which I don't understand what it means). Without looking, he quickly answered yes. After paying, I opened the boxes so my babies can enjoy them and me and my husband each had one. As my kids eating their second Manjoo and I was getting one for myself, surprisingly I found the bottom layer of the Manjoo are molded! The first layer was already eaten by my family without looking with the trust that the cashier told me it was freshly made today. I was furious! These are eaten by my young children! 1 year and 3 year old ate the molded Manjoo! I brought these molded Manjoo to that cashier and questioning him why is this molded since he said it was freshly made today?! He then flip over the box and looked at the bottom and said, \"sorry, these are from two days ago.\" Two days ago?! So now you tell me it's from two days ago?! How can you sell these old Majoo after I specifically asked you twice if these are freshly made today?! If these are for me, I wouldn't be so angry. But my babies ate molded food after I put my trust in this cashier's words and Lee's quality of food! I am beyond angry! I am beyond furious! I will never bring my kids here or feed them anything from Lee's anymore!"}
{"text":"As much hype as this place was getting from people I know, I really really wanted to like the place. 
We ordered sesame balls with red been, one milk tea boba, and one passion fruit milk tea with passion fruit flavored jellies and boba. Unfortunately they were out of the sesame balls, but they said that they would make them fresh, and that they were worth waiting for. 
Needless to say i was way excited, and looking forward to my freshly made treat.  
5-7 min later we finally got the our drinks, however it did not at all look like what we ordered! we received 2 what tasted and looked like iced vanilla lattes from starbucks with only boba in one and both boba and flavorless jellies in the other. Surprised by our confused looks, the lady at the counter offered to remake the drinks. It didn't look like she had figured out what we wanted, so I declined to get mine remade, unlike my friend who accepted the offer. Unfortunately, the second time around was just as unsuccessful. It still looked about the same, except now served in a large cup instead of a regular cup, and about 1000 times sweeter.  Even though we were disappointed about our beverages, that was not the main reason for our visit, so we were willing to overlook it. However when we finally got the sesame balls, they were not only super greasy, they were super hot, and NOT red bean. Really?! What did I just wait around for?!  
I do understand that this place is called Lee's \"sandwiches\" for a reason, and I heard that their sandwiches are supposed to be pretty good, but after 3 strikes I don't think I wanna go back to find out.

This place was disappointing, and I say save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are always consistent. Fast service and friendly staff. I prefer this one to the Chinatown one."}
{"text":"Grilled pork is amazing! I was hesitant in trying the grilled pork but my sister suggested it.  I'm glad I took the chance.  Love the fresh bread.  Smells so yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch close to home

Pro's
1) Friendly staff, good customer service
2) Order was ready within an acceptable time... for 2 sandwhiches it took 8 minutes.
3) Food is fresh, they bake the bread in house...was a good tastin sandwhich. I had the veggie with avocado on a baguette and my husband had the turkey club with bacon. 
4) Good quality for the price...total was about $15 for the 2 sandwhiches (10 in.) and a Gatorade..

Cons
1) There was only one other couple in the restaurant yet all the tables were dirty from previous customers. Since it was so slow I would have expected them to be cleaned."}
{"text":"Just tried this place Monday the 22nd of May. The sandwich was delicious. I will definitely go back. They have a wonderful variety of sandwiches. Thank goodness we have a decent sandwich shop in the neighborhood !!"}
{"text":"I passed right by Lee's Sandwich Shop while driving down Warner to do some shopping. In fact, I'd have to say I've passed by it fifty times driving down Warner. It doesn't stand out, it isn't flashy, it looks like an everyday convenience store. But when I asked my wife to find us a sandwich shop on that fateful day, Lee's Sandwich shop popped up with four stars. This place is very clean, very fast, very cheap, and very good. With a split menu featuring a European side and an Asian side, you'll certainly find something you've never tried or heard of. I recommend branching out, try something new, the barbecue pork sandwich is unbelievable. You will not regret your visit to Lee's."}
{"text":"Since it just opened, it was really busy, which was expected, but what happened to me was really out of line. I went in early morning so it was not as busy as it would have been during the day, but I ordered a simple breakfast sandwich and it was actually the wrong order, when I told them this, they just said \"ohh would you like me to just change the sticker for you to the order you wanted?\" this got me really upset because the sandwich I ordered was actually twice the price of the one they gave me. After arguing back and forth, the employee went to the back and came back out with my same sandwich, except this time with a sticker of the sandwich that I actually did order. More arguing finally led to a refund of my money and I left. There were a lot of good reviews about this place, but after my experience I will be sure I never go back"}
{"text":"Oh, One of my \"Mountain favorites\". I've been to Lee's many of times, just trying out the menu. Great stop and blessed assistance."}
{"text":"I don't know why they are changing their standards at Lee's Sandwiches could explain why their location was practically empty today . In the past I've always loved their iced coffee but recently fell in love with their Iced Mint Milk Tea with Grass Jelly which usually is over ice. Today they tried to give us this drink blended with ice and the last time I tried it blended with jelly it wasn't as good as over ice so today I explained to them that it wasn't good blended that it was almost tasteless and so they remade it and I didn't realize they didn't even give us any grass jelly because they completely filled the cup with ice barely giving you any drink and some of the ice cubes looked like they could had been jellies . I don't like to give bad reviews but to be honest I felt completely ripped off. I should had gone down the street to Dutch where they always take care of me."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are decent at best but the spring rolls here are not good at all compared to the ones in Cali... Wait they just aren't good. The sauce is for lack of a better word \"gross\" and the spring roll was almost frozen from the cooler they put it in. It doesn't have the vermicelli noodles in it either and no peppers or pickled daikon or carrots... Pretty much a fail all the way around."}
{"text":"24hrs, Food is what you pay for but the BOBA Smoothies are on point here.  Great Late Night Stop for a quick Bite"}
{"text":"This would've have gotten 4 stars for how large it is plus the fact it's open 24 hrs!!! BUT....for some reason the night we went there was a crazy funky smell going on which was a huge turnoff upon walking in.  Not sure what it was, it was only on one side of the place but UGH.

Service was friendly and efficient.  We did see a lot of cookies on sale and had some picked out until we noticed they all had expired.  Soooo those went back as well.  Not cool at all!! Ya now im thinking why 3 stars??

For now i'll keep at 3 since they had the free viet papers mom loves in front for me to grab :)"}
{"text":"We stopped here for coffee and a quick lunch. Lee's ice coffee was one of the best I've ever had! I also got a combination banh mi sandwich and pork/shrimp eggrolls, both were very good. My husband got the special combination, same as mine except much more meat and as he would say \"it hit the spot\" 
The store is cute with a variety of drinks and snacks to buy and had a lot of seating. Aside from banh mi sandwiches they also offer American deli meat toppings, steam buns, spring rolls and boba smoothies. It is also open 24 hours! It's a great place for lunch or a quick snack. 
We'll definitely have to try the one here in IL."}
{"text":"Great customer service! I left and forgot my sandwiches and called in to see if they still had it.  The manager was very nice and told me that their regulation is to throw it away after a couple hours.  I came in and he made the sandwiches again for me.  The sandwiches hit the spot! So glad I came here to  grab some sandwiches for my vegas trip. I ended up buying some steamed pork as well to snack on later and it comes with a baguette! He was kind enough to offer a plastic bag so that the bread doesn't get stale throughout the night. I'm def coming back again for my next Vegas trip"}
{"text":"Terrific Vietnamese banh mi (baguette sandwiches). Try the BBQ pork or the meatball. Dirt cheap, too. Ambiance is that of a well-lit aircraft hangar, but it's fun for lunch."}
{"text":"Growing up in California, I used to frequent Lee's whenever I was in the mood to have a good Banh-Mi French/Viet sandwich. The baguette is made nice and fresh, and for the price you do get a decent meal. However, with so many Lee's opening up lately, I don't think the quality is as stellar as it was before. However, still a decent place to have a nice sandwich and I do stop by from time to time. I prefer this location over the one on Spring Mountain in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Amazing taste. I love to eat a Lee's sandwich any day of the week. The flavors remind me of Asia. Unique touch and elegance I have only experienced at this Lee's. Don't hesitate to stop by. You will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"First time here. I live close by and remember the signs going up when they had their grand opening. I kept telling myself I need to check it out. I finally got a chance to go. Unfortunately I wasn't impressed. Also they turned off the \"OPEN\" sign almost 2 hrs before the store closed. I'm just saying but to me that seems like bad business. If they place closes at 9:30pm why turn of the signs so early. And when I left the guy locked the doors behind me to make sure nobody tried to come in for more sandwiches. I was expecting a munch better sandwich place I wasn't very impressed. Stinks cause I wanted a sandwich place close to me."}
{"text":"I love Lees and go there often but I have to say, they have been skimping quite a bit on how much meat they put on their sandwiches. They used to give a better portion and all of a sudden they are putting less and less. DO NOT GO DOWN HILL LEES!! People in the area are relying on you guys to keep your quality and decent price going. If you start raising prices and lowering the quality of the food, I assure you, you will be out of business fairly quickly. I will continue going to you guys for my sandwiches but don't get skimpy or you will lose customers and I will go somewhere that doesn't require cash to purchase."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Try it once and u will want to come back for more. The people r friendly and the place is very clean. They have dessert also not thus time for me maybe next. One more thing to remember pull on the door going in. Lol"}
{"text":"In my eyes, Lee's is the McDonalds of Vietnamese sandwiches. There are a ton of better choices in Chinatown, but none as accessible as Lee's. With that said, I can get my craving satiated with a 10 minute drive versus a 30 minute one. It's cheap and easy and not so bad tasting, if you haven't had the actual good stuff before. The grilled pork is my go-to sandwich, but sometimes I feel like they just pop the meat in a toaster oven. Not the best, but in a pinch, it'll do. 

Lee's Vietnamese coffee has got to be the worst tasting Viet coffee - it's all canned, not freshly made as it should be. Perhaps it's the extreme commercialization of common Vietnamese foods that makes me uncomfortable, but they really aren't that good. Pop into the nearest Asian supermarket and find better choices. 

Overall, their sandwiches are great to-go food, but not the tastiest choices on the market. I would also go there for their baguettes when they're fresh -- and cheap! Their croissants and mangoos are bomb as well. 

TIP: Cash only unless paying more than $5."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich place. Weird sandwiches. Doesn't taste good at all. I suggest not to go here"}
{"text":"This has got to be the nicest Lee's sandwiches I've ever seen and been in. The place is pretty spacious, modern and welcoming. I've never seen so many local Asians in the Vegas area. We picked up six sandwiches on our way back to L.A. Two for breakfast, two for lunch and we still have more for lunch tomorrow. There was a deal for buy 5, get 1 free. Couldn't resist. Go check it out. It's a little Asia in the entire shopping center. I think the coffee is a bit overpriced though."}
{"text":"The first thing that needs to be addressed is directed toward anyone who gives this place 3 stars or less. This is not a fancy sandwich shop...with that being said, don't come here expecting a sandwich piled 6 inches high that not even Fat Albert could finish. What you can expect is a good sandwich at a very decent price. 

They are cash only and that is how they keep their costs low. There's an ATM in the lobby in case you forget to stop at the bank. 

I love the variety of sandwiches they have ranging from a basic croissant ham and cheese to a grilled pork on a freshly baked (in house) baguette. The pate pouches are super tasty and good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. 

They have over 30 types of smoothies so you are sure to find a flavor you love or try a new one you haven't yet. My favorites are the avocado and taro ones. Sounds odd, but they are very refreshing! I can't wait to get back to Arizona to try new items!"}
{"text":"This place sucked....

My gf took me here, and damn I was disappointed. I ordered thespicy pork sammich, I was excited for it because it was different. Once I got it, I had about a slice of pork and a pound of carrots. 

Oh, and I told the guy no onion. My receipt read no onion. What did my sammich have... Onion. 


Only good thing is that it super cheap."}
{"text":"To the management: you do not let new hires to run the store. I was there on a Monday morning and despite there were 2 cashiers there (which was so rare), one female cashier was waiting for 2 undecisive female customers (which happened way too often) and the other male cashier just stood there like a statue. One senior staff was in sight but she's at the back. I waited for 5 minutes behind a group of 4. I decided to leave because I did not want to wait half an hour for my order as people in your kitchen were new as well."}
{"text":"Where we live they don't have bahn mi sandwiches so when we visit Las Vegas I usually grab one. I usually go to Dakao but we go to Nielsen's frozen custard near by and decided to give it a try. 
I was kind of disappointed. 
I had the BBQ pork and grilled pork bahn mi and they were both ok. 
The bread was chewy not crispy on the inside and soft on the inside and didn't taste freshly baked. 
There wasn't much meat and it was fatty and grisly. 
The store was empty so we got good service.
The parking is good. 
Maybe I'm spoiled by the more original bahn mi in Chinatown but I don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is definitely cheap.  When you order 5 sandwiches you get the sixth one FREE! It works out really well for us because we work as a family, so basically I can feed my whole family lunch for under $35.

We used to order the grilled pork sandwiches which are the best, but recently we have been trying to cut down on meat and so we have been ordering the vegetarian sandwiches. I challenge you to tell the difference.You would really think their is some kind of meat in their.  I don't really know what it actually is. I think it is some kind of tofu."}
{"text":"I don't really know what brought me to this place. I was on a nighttime drive through Chinatown, to which I was suddenly attracted to this surge of bright fluorescent lights. My initial drive home instantly turned into a detour. I fell victim to this place, much like a fly getting zapped by a mesmorizing bug light.

Walking in, I was kinda impressed. It seemed like this place had it all. It was like a mashup of everything I go out of my way for: convenience store drinks & snacks, Asian sandwiches, baked goods, frozen yogurt (coming soon), coffee, smoothies, boba, etc. It had all of this, plus it was open 24/7.

I was happy... giddy even. The concept of this store brought out the inner schoolgirl in me. 

That all went downhill after I placed my order. I ordered a sandwich; a grilled pork one. 

Price wasn't too bad. Maybe around the $4 spot.. decided to order a coffee with it as well. I sat at my table eagerly waiting (still on a schoolgirl mindset). Place wasn't really all that busy. Somehow, I still ended up waiting for my sandwich and coffee for over 10 minutes. A bit too long for a simple order. They call out order numbers using a DMV-like system. I'm guessing they're also trying to mimic the DMV wait times as well. Kinda boggles my mind to see how long it took, when I see what seems like 50 employees working the kitchen.

After I got my order, I no longer was ecstatic. My inner giddiness turned into a neutral feeling. The baguette bread of my sandwich was hard, almost stale tasting; the pork: nothing impressive.  After the first bite, I had the most plain pokerface going on. It was a bland, dry, and overall, a depressing food. 

The coffee had a very strong flavor, though creamed and sweetened to the max. The coffee taste was so intense that I felt like I was getting smacked in the face with a sack of coffee beans with each sip. I kinda liked it, in a kinky sort of way. 

Am I coming back to this place? Probably not. I know there's some new store kinks going on, but I just don't see how it can get much better than my initial visit.

Note - So far, it's a cash only joint, though they decided to get an ATM inside instead of a credit card machine. I guess they prefer to give us surcharges over convenience."}
{"text":"Dear Lee,

Where the hell is the meat? Please fix.

Sincerely,
Ace.

PS. Cash only....really?"}
{"text":"I've lived where there are four of these shops in the same strip mall (Seattle, Houston)  and while Lee's isn't the best ever, the fact that it exists  and is clean and tasty makes me really appreciate it.  I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would order off the \"American\" menu...."}
{"text":"I've seen these places around and decided to stop in one day after moving near the area. Now I am definitely a regular. 

First, the food - it's great. I usually get the #11 which is some combination of meats. I don't ask questions. All I know is that head cheese is one of the ingredients and now evidently I like head cheese. 

The sandwiches are big for what you pay.  They aren't overflowing with ingredients but there's a really good ingredient to bread ratio. And that bread is delicious.

I've only recently started drinking their coffee but I can see why people love it. I'm usually a black coffee guy but for the occasional iced coffee sugar rush, this place is terrific. 

The staff has always been very friendly. The seating is a little IKEA-ish but comfortable. It is definitely more of a sandwich shop than a coffee shop environment. Inside there are all kinds of Asian snacks for your perusal as well as tons of bottled drinks (again including their own coffee). 

All things considered I really can't find anything not to like about this place."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, quick, and great place for sandwiches. They have other oriental snacks as well. You should definitely try if you are close. Just remember,  CASH ONLY! I made the mistake of not having cash on me and had to go back of the line and use their atm (yes, they have atm machine if you forget to bring cash with $1.50 fee)"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!!!!!! Being open 24 hours is probably the only thing that's good about it, but everything else just blows. 

It's in the Pho Kim Long parking lot, so beware of parking. It's in an Asian plaza (if you get my drift). The employees are not friendly whatsoever. The one chick who took my order even got annoyed when she gave me someone else's food. Like hello? You handed me the bag! Sorry for being an inconvenience to your life. 

Anyway, on to the food. The watermelon smoothie was disgusting. They don't use fresh fruit, so it was that super fake watermelon syrup tasting crap. Mixed with boba that turned solid after 5 minutes of being in the smoothie, just awful. It got thrown away after 2 sips. What a waste of $5! I hate their baguettes here because they are seriously like break-your-teeth hard. So, I opted for my sandwich on a croissant. Instead of the light and flaky croissant that we all know, what I got was bread baked into the shape of a croissant. Effing deceiving people! If you look at my picture, you can clearly see its bread and not a croissant. The meat was boring and tasteless. My bf had to put Sriracha on his sandwich when I brought it home just to add flavor to it. He also said the baguette was hard, which I already knew.

Ok, and they have this stupid policy that states any purchase with a card between 9pm-5am will be charged an extra 25 cent PER ITEM! WTF!!!! I'm pretty sure they make enough effing money to suck up credit card surcharges. If not, go back to being cash only. Don't be cheap and try to suck up any bit of money that you can. 

I used to like eating here when I was younger and didn't know the difference between food and good food. After eating so many bahn mis throughout my years of living in Vegas, I can strongly confirm that I will never eat here again. Garbage, just garbage!"}
{"text":"I love this place and their fresh baguettes make any sandwich taste amazing!  And great news for all you sandwich lovers out there- they now take card!!!  I usually get the grilled chicken sandwich or a breakfast sandwich.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Have to admit, I didn't expect this place to be that good but I was wrong. I had a BBQ pork sandwich and to go 3 beignets and a churo stick. Also noticed they sell bbq pork steam buns. Love those! Very clean and had a good selection of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Lee's have simple but super delicious sandwiches! The baguette is fresh, which makes it even better. ;) try their specialty coffee also, its really sweet but its so good!"}
{"text":"Great lil hidden gem. I love their sandwich's great breakfast and lunch sandwich shop. Not sure about the coffee, It's 4 bucks and their special brand. But in my opinion I could have passed on it. Other than that it's a very clean and spacious eatery."}
{"text":"Ordered #5 Grilled pork with no jalapeños or onions, an order of chicken wings, and an order of egg rolls. Everyone was nice and professional. Food was great. Only down side is that it's cash only... so I had to use their ATM machine to get cash out."}
{"text":"WOW what a value!! the Asian sandwiches are amazing AND cheap!  Order extra meat for yours if you like, not much $ extra.  My favorite is the #5.  it's the McRib of the orient!  (not a pork patty, REAL meat)

This sandwich has a following of devotees just like the McRib.  Only difference is that these followers prefer FOOD to \"food like substance\" (see Mcribwich episode of Simpsons; it was voted the #1 meat flavored sandwich) Not at lee's...This is real fresh made bread, real meat and fast service.  For breakfast I like the croissant sandwiches.  They are HUGE and super fresh.  

I've been to California's best and I will admit there are some amazing mom and pop shops there, but for a chain this is the tops.  We are in a desert, far from the orient, but it's so nice to get some authentic Asian sandwiches so far from their origin.

Most lunch customers I see buy their take out baguettes to eat at home with dinner. for 99 cents you cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian #12 with extra cilantro is my favorite! There ice coffee is always perfection. They always have fresh baguettes which I could eat endless roles but I don't lol.  The deli monjoo pastries are so tasty. I've been going to lees sandwiches forever and would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty unique spot. They have a lot of cool things and really good food. I got the barbecue pork sandwich and it was my first Vietnamese sandwich ever. I don't know if it's really my style but it's definitely something I'm glad I tried and would definitely try again. Only thing that bugged me was the bread it was so crunchy I felt like I was chewing for hours"}
{"text":"Great food, great value, excellent coffee. Can't go wrong and I can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This place is a little overrated to me. Sure the bread is good because it's fresh, but the meats don't ever sound appetizing nor are they satisfying. I guess I'm used to true Vietnamese style sandwiches and I've had so many better one."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good here, they just need to add a little more meat in their sandwiches. I feel like the sandwiches we got hardly had any meat on them. Their iced coffees here are also pretty good, the only complaint I have is that they put way too much ice! If you want their iced coffee ask for light ice. Other than that everything is good, will be back but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love Lee's sandwiches! I have always gotten the roast beef sandwich on the croissant with American cheese and it's delicious. This time I was able to get a coconut and pineapple smoothie that was extremely delicious! Thanks for the great customer service."}
{"text":"Great baguettes, but the rest is not figured out yet. 2/2 sandwiches came out wrong. Out of pastries Sunday midday. A lot of items still don't have prices on them in the store.

I hope things will improve once they figure things out, so I will give them another visit.

I the mean time, for a great banh mi go down to Bell and I-17 :)

3rd visit: cashier left someones transaction on the pay pad. I put my card in then he told me to take it out. So i pressed cancel to cancel the transaction. Then he blames me for it. LOL. Someone got a free lunch, lol

Also out of Chinese sausage (even though there are bags of it on the counter, out of chicken pastry and lemongrass chicken. Its 1pm."}
{"text":"Service was unbelievably slow today, 6/6/18.  Ordered my meal at 4:00pm...it is now 4:22 and counting.  First of all they're out of pickled veggies.  Unreal!  Especially when it's one of the main ingredients in the sandwich.  Then when I try to order a hot taro milk tea, the guy working the register says, \"We don't make it hot.\"  Ummm well sir it says it on your menu that you offer it so what the heck???  I am still waiting for my sandwich as I write this.  And there are three other customers waiting for their orders.  One lady finally had enough and is asking in a stern tone, \"How much longer??\"  Both employees are responding in turtle speed.  Omg!  I hope they didn't give her the special in her sandwich.  Two customers who ordered after me receive their orders, mainly because they had to inquire about it.  It is now 4:24pm.  Like really, how long does it take to make a darn sandwich???  I can't take it anymore so I go up to the counter and ask if my order is ready.  He is confused about what I ordered, so I remind him.  He finds my order and hands me my two sandwiches, I had to ask for my drinks and egg rolls to which he completely forgot about.  Then he tells me that they are out of eggrolls....are you freakin kidding me right now?  I finally left the shop at 4:30pm.  It took them half an hour to get it together.  I drive home and when I open up the sandwich, I find 2 strands of hair.  FML.  Grossness to the fullest!!  I guess I got the sandwich special today...lucky me."}
{"text":"This location is clean and smaller than the spring mountain one. I don't think they have the waffle coconut  that I like here though. The sandwiches here are good, but I didn't get any jalapeños in my sandwich? And I don't think they put soy sauce on my  sandwich but overall it's still good. I got the number 5 sandwich and added pork roll to it for $1.25 extra."}
{"text":"Almost everything is MEHHHH. The banh mi is probably one of the worst I've had in a while. They skimp on the pate and the fatty mayo. You can get better banh mi elsewhere for cheaper. The coffee is classic Vietnamese coffee that you can make yourself if you're willing to buy the coffee, the strainer, and the condensed milk. It's decent Vietnamese coffee, but it's not anything to rave about.

The one redeeming quality is that the pate chaud is on point. The crust is flakey/buttery while the meat filling is substantial and has a good texture.

The parking sucks. Parking is already limited because of the sheer size of the lot, but it gets worse because there's so many businesses in the same area. Because of these 2 aspects, you either come when it's not prime time or you park across the street where 99 Ranch is and walk.


TLDR- everything is meh except for the pate chaud. Vietnamese coffee is decent but it's not something you can't make on your own."}
{"text":"I was craving for some Banh Mi Thit Nuong today, decided to drive to Lee's since it was closest. First of all, I'm not a Banh Mi connoisseur but I've been eating Lee's sandwiches since they were just a food truck in San Jose in the 90s. When their sandwiches were only $1.25! 

Since then, a couple of things have remained the same... they are still a cash only establishment and their bread is still one of the best! 

This is definitely not to go for an authentic banh mi."}
{"text":"First of all I love their Deli Manjoo.  I am sad they don't put them in the cute little red lunch boxes with the little boy eating a Manjoo on the cover anymore, nonetheless they are still super tasty!  I love getting their vegetarian sandwich it is super yummy every time.  The bread is always a perfect combination of soft and crunchy, it's soft enough to eat pleasantly but not too soft to the point where everything is getting soggy and falling apart.  The vegetarian is a must have! I love the cilantro, carrots, fried tofu, and other vegetable they put in it (I believe it's radish? not sure, whatever it is, it is awesome!) and especially the sauce...I don't know what kind of sauce it is but whatever they're doing, they're doing it right! They cut the vegetables perfectly thin (so you don't feel like you're a rabbit).  Their sandwich is pleasant to the eye and delicious for my tummy! Keep making your Vegetarian sandwiches on point Lee's! Love it!   On the other hand, I am not a huge fan of their Thai Tea slushy it is kind of too icy for me, but I do love their regular Thai Iced Tea.  Other than that, customer service is good, the place is clean, and they have a modern vibe going on in there.  Love that this Lee's is located on the South West side (South Rainbow Blvd.) so I won't have to travel all the way to China Town to get my Lee's fix."}
{"text":"No complaints here! I do believe that the bread at this Lee's Sandwiches is better than the one in Chinatown. 

ATMOSPHERE: Just like the other two Lee's Sandwiches in Chinatown and the one in Henderson, it's brightly lit, clean and has a nice European-feel eating space. 

FOOD: I would definitely recommend the sardine banh mi with avocado (maybe a fried egg, if you wanna get fancy) and sriracha. Mmm... Okay. Okay. Focus! 
The croissants are one of my favorite items on the menu too. We ordered a veggie avocado on a croissant, Vietnamese coffee, Thai tea and the banh mi sardine. They gave a good amount of avocado, which I appreciated because some places skimp out on the creamy deliciousness and it comes out being super overpriced. Not here! They loaded it up *thumbs up*! The banh mi always have just enough filling and the bread here perfectly balances between crusty and soft in the middle. The pricing is affordable at $4-5 for a sandwich and $2-3 for refreshing and hits-the-spot drinks. 

SERVICE: So-so. Not memorable. Not bad though.

Overall experience: My new go-to when I need something filling and on the go. The location is great and I'm glad to see shops like Lee's Sandwiches opening up only one block away from home. I will definitely frequent this place often.

So, yes! Lee's, just take my money and let's be friends forever!"}
{"text":"I'd rather have a bottled drink than ever order their smoothies ever again. I tried lychee smoothie and it was SO sweet, it didn't taste authentic or fruity at all. In fact, it just tasted like milk and sugar. Tons of sugar. My friend disliked his thai tea as well, TOO MUCH SUGAR. The reason why I find it so sweet is because my regular boba spot is Tea Station, and their lychee snow is JOYGASMIC.

I will say that I loved the sandwich I ordered, which was bbq pork. I don't mind raw onions and the spice, it was good. My phone picked up wifi there, but it does require a password. I didn't inquire about it since I'm not there to surf the internet.

My friend also ordered beignets- now beignets are basically french donuts. Fried dough. WTF LEE'S. You come up with mini sweet pita pockets. When you bite into it, it's just.... empty. I really don't know if I'm going to go back. The place is so pretty at first glance, but it's a huge mindxuck.

Oh, I forgot to mention. Yes there's plenty of space to sit down. But it's not like anyone wipes down tables or clean the floors. Every table had at least some crumbs, and the floor under the table we sat at was so dirty. Shoe grime. Didn't catch it until we finally left. Blehh. =/"}
{"text":"I come here for the coffee mostly. Sandwiches are good also I would recommend the croissant instead of the regular bread. They do have little snacks you can purchase to go along with your lunch but the Thai coffee is the main attraction here"}
{"text":"Wow! It is open 24 hours! What a convenience. Their sandwiches are always so amazingly flavorful and delicious. They also sell a variety of products such as coffee, tea, and pastry. There are a wide selection of sandwiches to choose from. My favorite is always the Dac Biet and Grilled Pork. The bread are crispy and yummy, the pate is excellent. Staff are always nice. They also have the bubble popping bursting boba. I enjoy their Avocado smoothie, it is nice and thick and not icy or fake powder. 

They have cute pastry that are shaped like fishies are corn and filled with cream inside. It is a great place to come grab something quick to eat or take it to go. The price are decent and are under $5 for a sandwich. They have a great seating area and they also have bathroom available. The parking can be challenging as it shares it with tons of other restaurants and businesses in China Town. However, its a good size store. 

I highly recommend this Lee's Sandwiches for great tasting snack, lunch or late night eat. They have tv screens so you can easily know if your number is called and can get your food quickly."}
{"text":"I love all Lee'ses, and this is no exception. It's pricier than Lee's at home (LA and environs), but unlike in LA, if you order a drink with no ice, they still fill it to the top. See my Garden Grove review for info on specific food and drink (and a photo of a 1/4-full cup of coffee without ice... and a bag of ice on the side). One time our car was blocked in and we were unable to leave the parking lot due to TV cameras and \"men in black\" with their SUVs of black. Later found out it was because Hillary Clinton came to visit! We were feet away from her enjoying the fresh-baked bread, haha.

Came here a billion times while on vacation here and sick of paying exorbitant strip prices for food and tired of finding out all my authentic Chinese go-to places have closed down in the past few years. It is bigger than most locations with the exception of the also 24-hour Garden Grove location (my regular). One thing I prefer about this location is that they take card for purchases over $10. I don't remember if they have nighttime surcharges like Garden Grove but their prices are all generally higher than the locations in CA. But I guess that's the price you pay (literally) for being able to get real banh mi so close to the strip.

This strip mall is extremely popular and the parking lot is long, narrow, and hard to maneuver. It can be hard to find parking near the place you want."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Lee's was in California while looking at wedding dresses for my sister nearly 2 years ago. It was lunchtime and we were not far from one. She suggested it, as she had been there several times. I had never had a banh mi sandwich, so she ordered what she liked best. #5, the Grilled Pork. It was a while ago, and I only remembered that it was yum. 

I've lived in the Phoenix area for 4 years and I didn't know there was a Lee's here until several months ago I was in the Costco parking lot at Cave Creek & Loop 101. There was a tattered, torn and dirty Lee's bahn mi paper bag on the ground. What?!? Lee's?!? Here?!? I looked it up online, and sure enough, there was a Lee's in Arizona. But in Chandler, an hour away from home. 

The mister and I just purchased a home in North Phoenix in June and needed a washer/dryer. Instead of purchasing new, we Craiglisted for a decent nice set. Lucky me, I found a set worth the drive to Chandler. Right down the street from Lee's. I really wanted to go, but was skeptical because Louie is more tentative with trying new foods (although he's doing a lot better at that now). He agreed and we went. It was fantastic and Louie loved it. I think this trip we both had the #10, Cured Pork and Pork Roll. The meat is thinly sliced and has the perfect saltiness to match the sweetness of their special mayo, tangy & crisp pickled veggies, with a bit of spice from jalapenos (I had mine with no onions). The French baguette was perfect. We were able to stuff ourselves for less than $10 including fountain drinks.

The staff is great. The following weekend we made another trip to the area, to Ikea. Since we were already this far, Lee's was added to the itinerary, so our friend could try it out. Louie thought the #11 Special Combo sounded good, so he ordered it. The young lady that took our order was nice enough to ask if he knew what was in it. Headcheese. I'm not a big foodie, so I didn't know what it was exactly. Not cheese. She gave him a sample and it's a good thing she did. He is not a fan of headcheese. LOL. 

The place is clean, has a huge dining area, a bakery counter and an ice cream counter, I think....? No one was at the other counters, so I didn't take a good look. I've yet to have them, but the smoothies and boba drinks look yum, so next time I'll give them a try. The only downside is that we are debit card people and they are cash only. But well worth the trip to an ATM (or to Walgreens next door for a cash-back purchase)!"}
{"text":"A NOT TO MISS if you like Baguette Sandwiches. merci!"}
{"text":"The few times I've been here there wasn't much a of line or even atmosphere. Granted, it was probably 2AM in the morning, but I still except some liveliness from the customer service.

At any bahn mi place, I'll get a Pork Roll or Veggie sandwich. The pork roll here is ok, the veggie? No thanks. Stale tofu and vermicelli, not to mention a weird funky flavor permeates the filling.

I'll be interested in seeing how their Portland storefront holds up."}
{"text":"I don't understand the low rating.  The sandwiches are reasonably priced.  They make the good crusty bread on the premise.  The veggies in the banh mi are pickled and give a great crunch and flavor to the sandwich.  Can't beat the price for what you get."}
{"text":"Soooo, I typically love me some Lee's Vietnamese coffee! Yet, today was a pretty shorty experience. I didn't catch the guys name but it wouldn't be difficult knowing who I'm speaking about. He has an LV tattooed on his face near his eye. 

My friend was asking simple questions and the guy was rude. We asked for light on the ice and he tried to serve us barely any coffee."}
{"text":"I guess I went at the wrong time. I asked for a pork banh mi sandwich and just got a stare back!
I've been to other Mr. Lee's and asked for the same thing and received food. Not here, after a long staring contest I asked if she understood what I said. She said not really. 
I asked if anyone else could help me? Another long stare and she said what do you want?
Then stated pointing and picking up meat!
I left......"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place because its open 24 hours and the food is decent/cheap. Also, the food is prepared relativlely quickly and its a good change from the other 24 hour burger chains like McDonalds. My favorite sandwich to order is the #11 special combo: it has a nice balance of meat and vegtables.

My only complaint is the cleanliness. Since the place is open 24/7 it attracts the drunk crowd. I remember going here around midnight and seeing a pile of puke outside the entrance."}
{"text":"I was not impressed and the sandwich was just mediocre.
I guess if fast food, hurry n go...it was ok, nothing fantastic.  They were lean on the meat, the only thing good about it was the bun.
Rather disappointed, won't be back."}
{"text":"had the #6 and also an order of wings. for the price it was great. it was good but not great. on the plus side, its 24 hours."}
{"text":"I heart my Lee's sandwiches!
I also like the spring rolls (sans shrimp) and vermicelli (w/egg rolls & grilled pork)
I like that they take credit cards, unlike most Lee's I've been to.
They've gotten my orders right 100% of the time so far! (I usually ask for no jalapenos)

I don't like that I almost always come out smelling like fish sauce."}
{"text":"Why so much hate??? They've got to be doing something right for this chain to make it this far. Lee's Sandwiches will one day be an international phenomenon. Now I'm not on the bandwagon yet because of several key concepts, but I consider Lee's Sandwiches the Starbucks/McDonald of Vietnamese fast food. Not to say I'm against or for fast food chains, I simply respect success. Keep in mind how many people these chains employ and the salary and benefits they provide vs horribly ran, no customer service mom and pop places. 

Vietnamese food really have the potential to be as mainstream as say American, French, Italian, Mexican and Chinese cuisine. But sadly, what really holds it back is the concept. Most great Vietnamese chefs don't understand that style is as equally important as flavor profile. The rare greats that do understand, like the An family with the Crustacean (http://www.anfamily.com/Restaurants/crustacean_beverlyhills/displaypages/homepage.html) chain is simply killing it. 

So ask yourself this. Would any non-Yelpers (Westerners), or even Yelpers that's not adventurous , dare step foot in a place like Dakao, or Pho Hue Thai and order Banh Mi?

I think Lee's Sandwiches is fantastic for what this city needs. It's a slap in the face for all the local shops to kick it up a notch (mainly Decor and customer service). It's a wake up call to say that good food is no excuse for poor overall dining experience. 

In conclusion, this Lee's offers way too many choices for their own good. Less is more. Just look at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Lee's is a great California-based sandwich chain with endless options, cheap prices, and excellent bread (baguettes are great). This location is near my mom's house so I've frequented Lee's on multiple occasions. Don't be overwhelmed when you walk in and begin reading the menu/walls. Just take your time and you will certainly find something to your liking. This is a cash-only restaurant so don't forget to bring some or no Lee's for you!"}
{"text":"Our  family loves this place. Having breakfast with delicious coffee today. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I think I am a bit spoiled by my favorite bahn mi joint in Chinatown. I was in the mood for one but didn't feel like going across town so I gave Lee's a try. The visit started off decent - the place is clean and nicely decorated. I then noticed that it was cash only. Really? It's not like we are in the sticks. Oh wait, there is an ATM right at the counter. Oh I get it. You want me to use your ATM to get my cash and pay a fee. No thanks! Luckily I had some cash on me.

I ordered my standard bahn mi, which is the meatball (#7 here). The bread was delicious, but the meat was just gross. It was all gelatinous and had the strangest texture, and I'm not sure it was cooked all the way through. So I basically ended up eating bread for lunch - not very satisfying.

I'll skip it in the future and make the trek back to Chinatown for my favorite."}
{"text":"Once in a while I would have a craving for a veggies Lee's sandwich with extra Cilantro. My review can only base on that particular sandwich. The price is cheap about $4.50 a sandwich. The place is pretty clean and spacious."}
{"text":"cash only ($1.50 ATM fee). chain concept from Vietnam. \"mass-produced\" baguettes ready \"every 30 minutes\" are not worth the trip.

$2.25 10\" bologna salami and vietnamese veggies. what do you expect for $2.25?! great value...
but i was hoping for better.
--rancid pickle
--rancid red onion
--american cheese: think \"cheap brand that wishes it were kraft singles\" -- yeah, it was BAD
--no oil in the house, no vinegar in the house. only mayo and mustard in the 0.02 oz packet.

lots of choices here...
ice cream, wings, sandwiches...
cheap, generic, flavored coffee syrups displayed like precious alcohol... WHAAT!?? maybe it's a cultural thing.

but all i wanted was a good baguette sandwich. what a shame!
PASS!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious but check your sandwich before you leave! They messed up on 2 out of 3 sandwiches (wrong meat) even though the wrapper state the correct order."}
{"text":"Pretty great place if I wasn't pregnant I would try the pate but there menu is pretty simple the food is pretty good. No complains here but would I recommend it to someone maybe but overall the experience was great, employee were awesome, and hope they keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I dont understand any of the negative reviews abut this place. This place makes the best sandwich ive ever had. I only order the special combination sandwich. Head cheese, pate, pork roll. I had this sandwich a few weeks back for the first time and have been back 6 times since. The combination of flavors is a masterpiece. I once waited 35 minutesin line for a sandwich. I crave this sandwich everyday, at under $4 this is an excellent deal. I love Lee's, and am glad that i live around the corner from this place."}
{"text":"This place is highly over hyped! 

Their sandwiches are very dull and bland. Before this place was open my boyfriend would count the days till their grand opening, So I was definitely excited and expecting more but honestly I don't have much to say about this place. 

Food: dull, bland not exciting

Price: Okay 

Hours/location: convenient hours and the location is close to the strip so its a good late night DRUNK snack"}
{"text":"Popped my bahn mi cherry today :) . Establishment was clean and modern. Walked up to the counter not really knowing what to get. I scanned the menu looking for something that would appeal to me. I asked the worker what wouldn't be \"too fatty\" and he walked away to look at the nutritional information posted on the other side of the restaurant...cute lol.
After some more looking we ordered the BBQ pork sandwich and pork roll with pâté as I figured that is the quintessential essence of a bahn mi.
Not a bad price for 2 10\" sandwiches and a Thai tea boba, all for under $12.
We started with the BBQ pork sandwich, pork sliced thin and lean, pickled veges, cilantro and thin sliced jalapeño pepper on a firm, crunchy baguette...very nice. I enjoyed the crunch of the fresh veges and jalapeño accented with cilantro. I liked it a lot. Now the pork & pâté sandwich was a bit ambitious as I now know I'm definitely not a fan of liver pâté. At first bite, the pork roll sandwich was smooth and creamy, but the finish of the pâté did not please my taste buds at all. So I scraped off the veges into the other half of our BBQ pork sandwich and polished that off. The Thai tea boba was too sweet and the boba wasn't fresh. They offered a cantaloupe smoothie but no cantaloupe juice...hmmm.
We will definitely be back for the BBQ pork sandwich and maybe try the grilled pork sandwich next time. But I can now check off bahn mi from my bucket list :)"}
{"text":"Been to many many Lee's Sandwich over the year, this is the most disappointing visit.
Few day old bread soft not crunchy as it should be.
Order took over 25 minutes, should be more stuffs making sandwiches. 
Very DISAPPOINTED! !!"}
{"text":"Very nice clean and organized good food. Highly recommended place for coffee beaks and meet people."}
{"text":"Love the bread in the sandwiches. I always go for the pork sandwich. Very clean and modern setting. Rarely a long wait in the line and the food is ready quick enough. Simple and good, but I only come if i have a real craving for it."}
{"text":"I went to Lee's with much trepedation after reading countless bad reviews, but I just had to try this spot on my lunch break because it was convienent.

First off, I took heed from other Yelpers and stayed away from the baguettes and instead got a croissant roast beef and cheese with all the trimmings. It was a decent sandwich, nothing to rave about, but everything tasted good.

Secondly I was weary of ordering a drink due to the excessive ice comments. I just opted for a soda in case I got the same treatment of ice with an expensive coffee beverage. Well... there was a lot of ice, but at least I didn't pay an arm and a leg for it.

That was it. Short and sweet. Oh I did happen to only have my card and my total came to $8.97. The cashier informed me I wouldn't be able to use the card unless I bought $15 or more the NEXT TIME I came in. ha! Not sure why I got away with that, but hey, I did!

Oh they have fro-yo here too. I did not try, it but it looked good!"}
{"text":"I was impressed how clean this restaurant looks and the bathrooms too.  The dinning room is spacious with lots of seating.  They make their baguettes fresh onsite and the place smells great.  I only had a Thai tea this time, but I definitely will come back for a sandwich !"}
{"text":"**This review is only for the filtered iced coffee** I haven't tried anything else except their coffee although I intend to!

Their iced coffee is my favorite ever. It's perfectly sweet, but strong. I've been going here for iced coffee for a while, but I still have to dilute my coffee with water. You can honestly make your coffee last a while if you just keep adding water. 

You can purchase the concentrate frozen in the cold case & one frozen bottle can make 3 servings of iced coffee for about $6. They're in the cold case towards the left of the restaurant.

Every time I go to Vegas I have to go to Lee's because i've yet to find a better iced coffee!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood to have a Banh Mi and it's been quite awhile since I ate here, probably 2-3 years.  It was a rainy day and it just seemed like the right type of food and to down it with a boba drink.

Thought about treating my mechanic and his helper and I thought my husband would like this.  And I know my kids already like this, and they were starting to eat solid food again from being sick the past week.

Ordered 3 grilled pork Banh Mi's, 2 grilled chicken and a roast beef croissant sandwich and 2 orders of 5 pork & shrimp egg rolls.  There was nobody ordering at the time we ordered and the lull of any lunch rush was over.

The Banh Mi's were very reasonably priced at $3.49 and it's quite a lot for a sandwich.  The egg rolls, I thought, were a little pricey at $3.99 for 5 Vietnamese style egg rolls (deep fried), but the sandwich price made up for this.  I can't remember how much the small croissant sandwich was, but I think that was close to $5 and it wasn't very big.

So the deal is to get a Banh Mi, but my son wasn't up to eating that much and needed something softer.  All that came to about $31-32, which that's food for 6 people's lunches, so not bad.

It took probably 15 minutes to make the order, which the egg rolls were already prepared, so I thought it took a bit more time.  I didn't know that the Banh Mi wrappers indicated what sandwich it was.

The guy that took my order is Latino, which isn't a big deal.  I think the guy making the stuff was Asian.  Oh, and make sure you bring cash.  They do not take credit or debit cards and there is a machine for you to get cash, but there is a $1.75 charge.  I wish they had this as a sign on the front door - CASH ONLY!  

Next time I will know.  That was why I gave it a 4 star, but really, it only deserves a 1/2 star knock down for that, not a full star.  But, since I'm Asian, I should know that some Asian places only do cash.  Okay, heck, I'll give them 5 stars.

We'd go again.  Everyone that I got the sandwiches for liked them.  The baguette was perfect - somewhat toasted on the outside and slightly soft on the inside.  The grilled pork was very tasty and just enough of the veggies, not too much.  Just the right amounts of meat and veggies.

My mechanic and his helper had the grilled chicken Banh Mi and they loved it.  The egg rolls were good."}
{"text":"First time having bánh mì outside of a cafeteria. Ordered the #5 grilled pork (thìt nuóng) and it blew my mind. Ordered a pork bun as well. It was baked in a puff pastry, not steamed. It was incredibly flaky and messy. Not bad but I wouldn't order again. The Vietnamese latte is to die for."}
{"text":"I just left, and it was my first time here. It's definitely a different place overall. It's kind of \"no frills\" on the sandwich, which is a good thing I might add. It was a well executed sandwich, though again, very simple. I tried the baguette instead of the croissant for my sandwich bread. I liked it, but just thought that the bread was too hard to be on a sandwich. Sandwich bread should be soft and not require so much effort to bite into. The caramel smoothie was delicious too for what it's worth. And though the place was clean and well lit, it did smell funky. Thus the 4 star rather than 5 star review. But I was impressed overall, and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been a Lee's fan for a while but tried to stop visiting franchises and concentrate on mom and pop.  After driving down Spring Mountain, I had to stop and try.

The service is ok.  They were very happy to see you there and they were quick at getting your order.  I ordered the banh bao and it was disgusting.  I swear there is a piece of hot dog in it!  The manjo was very good.  My son ate it all up.  The hallow bread is a rip off!!!!!  They have signs that said $1.29 and they charge you $1.59.  When you ask them why they charge you a different price, their answer is \"The price goes up every 2 weeks.\"  After rolling my eyes, they know they won't get any further business from us.

The sandwich was tasteless.  The bread made it taste better than what it really did.  They just pulled the bread out of the oven and it was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  There was absolutely no meat on the inside.  It looked like there was little slivers of meat and a crap load of veggies to hide the embarrassment.  There was a streak mark of pate.  I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Yap! a fan now, I had the teriyaki chicken on a huge croissant roll that was so,so,good and wifey had the teriyaki chicken on a baguette that was crisp on the outside and soft on the inside,we also had some manjoo cakes(very very good) also a box of L'Authentique Crepe Dentelle were very light and crispy just plain awesome.This place in huge,bright,clean,with a lot of glass,the staff were helpful and friendly,they sell other Items along with a area that self sreve frozon yogurt,the may be one of my favorite places in Vegas to get a awesome european sandwiches."}
{"text":"The food was really gross. I've paid 15 bucks for buns that were soggy and some small chicken nuggets. When we asked for light ice, it was filled to the brim.

For your chicken nuggets they don't even have sauce for it. It comes in little packets like your school lunch.

I couldn't even finish my food."}
{"text":"This review is hard for me. I don't like to give something like a three. I enjoyed the vegan sandwich and the price was good, but I was completely inconvieneced by the fact that they do not accept visa. I also own a small business and as much as we do not like paying the credit card fees, we do it to provide a service for our customers.
To add insult to injury, they pride themselves on the fact that they have an ATM for their customers to get cash from. So if they have the ATM, they also get paid to have that in their shop, but their customers have to pay an out of network fee to use the machine! This is ridiculous.
I placed my order over the phone and was clear that I was not familiar with the menu (a new customer) at that point the person should have informed me that they do not accept credit cards! I opted to leave and get cash from my own bank to pay for my to go order.
I probably will not be back after this. I feel like companies that deal in all cash avoid paying taxes and do not help the system that they are benefiting from in this country. So not happy"}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet. But honest all the way round. I came in to get lunch and left with the best tasting smoothie. I've ever had! Watermelon and passion fruit! So good! Omg! I will be coming back for that for sure! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had their pork sandwich and it was very flavorful but there was a lot of fat that you have to work around."}
{"text":"This is a review for their sesame balls. I'm kinda disappointed in the flavor of the filling in the inside. It's not as sweet and the sesame seeds kept falling off. I'm always craving sesame balls and not a lot of places out here carry them so these will do."}
{"text":"I came in to check this place out since so many people had good things to say before they opened up. Nice looking place as far as a sandwich shop goes, similar to a quickie mart feel but bigger. Looking at the menu they offer a wide selection of items like croissants, breakfast sandwiches and the Bahn Mi. I ordered a grilled pork bahn mi and a roast beef w/cheese sandwich. It took almost 10 minutes to get the roast beef sandwich which I can't understand since the grilled pork was ready almost right away. The bahn mi was good but about average for what you can get elsewhere. Other than the slowish service its priced right and its open all night so I have another option for late night grubbin after work."}
{"text":"Visited only once, but remember wanting to go back.  Blame it on my ever-growing list of places to try!  That's why I cannot agree whenever people tell me that great food is nowhere to be found here in the valley.  Are you kiddin' me??

Tried a couple of sandwiches, and surprise, the veggie one stole the show.  Awesome durian shake.  (Note: you must know and love durian, or you may be in for a surprise!).

Take some baguettes home.  
Cash only."}
{"text":"For a Lee's Sandwiches place, this is pretty top notch! Surprising since it is in LV and not Cali lol haha

Food, Location, Ambiance: A
Service, Prices: B

My family and I are always stopping by here before we drive home to California! This is one of the biggest and busiest Lee's I have been to. The sandwiches (especially the Xu Mai aka Meatballs) are the tastiest on their skinny baguettes! Their iced coffee is a must to try. Oddly, I also like their Milk Tea and Smoothie boba here, so the Boba Princess gives the approval to try it here haha. This is a Vietnamese fast food joint- not a 4 star French restaurant, so don't be too disappointed if the workers there are not as courteous or patient. Come for the food and drinks! Prices are okay but with any struggling economy, the prices always seem to increase so often but it's not the workers fault :/ It's all Mr. Lee lols Great to-go food, better hangover food haha"}
{"text":"I'm glad this place opened 24 hrs. Our cousin told us about this place, so we stopped by to get some breakfast Vietnamese Bahn Mi for breakfast and spring rolls for lunch on the road. We also ordered milk tea. Bahn Mi tasted so good. Spring rolls were huge and there were shrimp and pork. They were delicious. Milk tea was great. I never had such a good milk tea for a long long time. We will go back to get their food again when we come back to Las Vegas. Too bad we did not have time to take the pictures of the food."}
{"text":"Bought a grilled pork sandwich with pate added.  Ate about a forth of the sandwich when I realized they did not add the pate which I paid for. I took the sandwich back to the counter and explained the situation. They offered to make a new sandwich which I thought was nice. I got my new sandwich and realized how thin it was..less meat...less fillings.. It appears they gutted my old sandwich and put the innards into a new roll with pate. This was why the new sandwich was so thin.  Not cool!"}
{"text":"@ all your locations @ all times of the day the bread is so hard that it's hard to put it all in your mouth to take a bite without scraping roof of the mouth."}
{"text":"I grew up on Lee's sandwiches in Los Angeles! So was happy to find a local Lee's in Henderson, near my house! It's clean, service is fast, I always get that #11 Dat Biet Special and it always delivers! Lunch for $3.50-$4.00, you can't beat that in Henderson!"}
{"text":"I love that Lee's is ALWAYS open.  Got my boba and sandwich fix at 7am last week.  Their menu is kind of all over the board and they don't have the biggest selection of drinks, but it's mostly a sandwich shop I guess.  Had to wait a decent amount of time, but at least they made it fresh and it was, of course, very delicious."}
{"text":"My mom used to make me care packages with Lee sandwiches. She'd pack up 10 sandwiches, box them up, and send them up with me whenever I went home to visit her. Every time I ate a sandwich, it would remind me of my mom and home. 

These are some of my favorite sandwiches in the world: warm french bread with grilled meats and fresh veggies. Mmm.. I miss you mom!"}
{"text":"Not bad of a place for a quick sandwich!! Their smoothies are very good. Only thing negative about this place is that it only takes cash! Who carries cash now these days??"}
{"text":"Yummy, get the vegetarian with added avocado! Crunchy and satisfying. For the meat eaters, the homemade croissant with ham n' cheese is what my hubby loves."}
{"text":"Always a go to favorite.  Best Bahn Mi I've had.  The baguettes are terrific!  We have noticed that the cleanliness of the place seems to have gone downhill a bit.  It might be that we went right after lunch and they didn't have time to clean up.  I don't care, I still love the place!"}
{"text":"I loooooove their coffee and sandwiches! They have amazing baguette! If you like lots of meat and veggies, ask for extra (of course, you gotta pay extra). The only minus is... CASH ONLY! But again, we'll worth it."}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staffs. I also like that there's no wait time. The number 1 combination is good."}
{"text":"AMAZING Vietnamese sandwiches!!!! the BEST in Phoenix!
They bake their own baguettes, which is the reason why the place always smells so delish. I always order #11, which is the most authentic Vietnamese sandwich. It includes mayonnaise, pate, variety of cold cuts. I've taken people here and they all love #11.
And above all, this place is absolutely CLEAN! This is rare in lots of asian restaurants (unfortunately).
I give this place 4.5 because most of the times the baguettes get pretty hard. I've had it when the baguette was fresh, just came out and it was melt-in-your-mouth kind of crunchy.
I would come here any time of the day, any day of the week!
Cash only!"}
{"text":"Cheap, quick, and tasty.....I could probably find find one cheaper, quicker, and tastier, but the location is convenient, so I'll probably be back whenever I crave some bahn mi."}
{"text":"Always love coming to this place when I'm in Vegas. Got there traditional bahn mi sandwich and Vietnamese ice coffee. It's a bummer that they still only take cash. I'm glad to see that there prices are still low."}
{"text":"The only thing I ever get is the #6 BBQ pork sandwich and it's awesome.  Great snack for a great price.  I love their baguets."}
{"text":"Cash only! I have been enjoying Lee's for probably a decade and am still a fan. The meat quality is not the very highest but their fresh made croissants and baguettes will have you coming back for more. Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, not the quickest but can get you in and out for lunch. Great pastry options for purchase and their Thai iced coffee will keep you going all day. A sandwich, chips, and soda will land you around $11, not bad!"}
{"text":"If you need some Viet Coffee, Lee's is the spot.

Needed a pick me up and came to Lee's.

Parking lot is tight here. Restaurant is huge.

Iced Coffee, large - $4.75 - So over priced now! Sweet and strong!

Coconut Waffles ($1.99) and Manjoos ($1.29 for 4) are great sweets here also."}
{"text":"One word....AWESOME!!!

The number # 3 fantastic! The prices are fair. The service is quick. The food is delicious. Is there any other info that is needed? This is a must try place."}
{"text":"The biggest Lee's I ever been to! They have fro-yo machines too. Unfortunately, those weren't up and running yet!

Line was super long, but I have to give them props to maintaining such a busy crowd in an orderly manner.  

The sandwiches were consistent with other Lee's that I've been to.  They even had a window with all their fresh baked bread! Check out picture uploaded :)

Their coffee is awesome! Strong, flavorful.  It was what I needed to wake myself up from late nights and long hours of driving!

I only wish they had more to-go stuff that other Lee's have available (ie. sticky rice, spring rolls, vietnamese desserts, etc).  This place is more focused on sandwiches.  Think of a Mcdonald's version of Lee's!"}
{"text":"I kept giving it a try. Always a disappointment. U want Banh Mi, don't go here"}
{"text":"I'll agree that the baguettes are pretty damn solid. My only complaint is the meat to bread ratio. I mean, it is a sandwhich that costs $3.05 so I really shouldn't complain, but both times I have gone here there was very little pork on my sandwhich at the flavor of the pork wasn't even close to as awesome as the taste of the bread. So yeah, maybe for the future this is my new \"go to\" bakery in the area and I will just make my own sandwhiches at home with their baguettes. :)"}
{"text":"I have had the famous Banh mi sandwiches from this establishment long before they exploded to the commercial success they have now. Their prices have doubled since the last time I visited them. I have come across other Vietnamese restaurants that sell these type of sandwiches that are just as equally as delicious for about half the price. As for their drinks, I tried Lee's famous iced coffee and I must say it was better than I expected. It was not too sweet or too bitter. It was perfectly balanced and simply refreshing because they use crushed ice. Lee's Sandwiches is also spacious, clean and offer packaged baked goods to go as well. If you are looking for a place to grab a quick bite for breakfast, lunch, dinner or a coffee break snack, this is your place. They also offer boba teas and smoothies. I would have given them 5 stars but I just feel their sandwiches are a bit over priced compared to other Banh mi establishments."}
{"text":"This is not your average sandwich place. Nor are they normal sandwiches. They have a Vietnamese touch so it is different.
They are very fresh, all of the sandwiches that I have tried were delicious. They have various other things in this place, it's all very interesting.
The prices are great. The people are friendly. Go there."}
{"text":"It was a madhouse in there today with the grand opening.  I opted out of the buy 1 get 1 coffee because 1) I am a tea drinker and 2) I was not with anyone who could try the second one.  There was no way I was going to drink 2 coffees!

Nevertheless, I got there after 10 but still acquired a $5 gift card for being in the first 500 customers.  The place was insanely crowded with people in suits - apparently there was some lawyer event outside and even some guys wearing cool pants dancing and hitting drums.

I ordered the vegetarian banh mi which included tofu and yam.  I had no idea how to get in line originally until I asked, and then when my number was called I had no idea where to pick up...and finally figured it out.  Oddly, I had completely forgotten that I have been to Lee's in Houston with my brother a few times but it was so long ago that I never made the connection when Lee's opened in Chinatown - I never went to that location and I thought it was only in California.

I think next time I will use my gift card for boba (avocado shake sounds pretty good right now!) - but my sandwich was unremarkable.  I ate it while perusing fresh52 which led me to buy feta batard from Bon Breads :)  The tofu (fried) and yam were shredded so that they appeared like potato sticks.  The carrot and daikon cuts were much bigger.  I was disappointed, because at Pho Thanh Huong I get the steamed tofu which is sizeable, clearly healthier, and more appealing to eat.

I do think it is cool that this joint opened in Henderson.  For Henderson banh mi, I recommend Lemongrass Cafe.  For central, PTH.  I still need to try Dakao.  Yet it is still nice to know I can get boba nearby, so I will be back!

CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is a great place to grab sandwiches and snacks. Banh Mi, built on one of their fresh and super tasty baguettes makes for a great meal. Yumm!!!! Vietnamese iced coffee is great too! Service is fast and friendly. Prices are reasonable, but remember to bring ca$h! They do have an ATM if you forget, but best to come prepared as they only take cash."}
{"text":"My husband & I found the best place for sandwiches which are perfect if you're looking for light meal. This is the place to hang out. Love it!"}
{"text":"Well I have since learned that getting double meats is the way to go...and you'll still be coming in under $5.
I tried the special combo with double meats...wow.  The flavors that already were awesome were even more so.  Doubly.
I've also had the grass jelly drink.  Again, wow. 
It is friggin' delicious.  I think its called Milk Mint Jelly???  Whatever its called, its such a refreshing drink.  And the grass jelly makes it fun.
With value, quality, and taste all coming together, I've given 5 stars now."}
{"text":"I'm not sure when this started but tonight I noticed a sign that states from 9pm to 5am there is a 25 cent surcharge on every item sold. The establishment is open 24 hours. It's ridiculous that they would operate in this manner.  Are they paying their employees more in the evening? Highly doubtful. 

Bread was delicious as usual. Hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Enjoy the coffee here and the grilled pork sandwich. Good price. I go here 2 to 3 times a week. I coffee is very strong and help keeps me up during the day to study."}
{"text":"Coming from Cali, this is the biggest Lee Sandwiches I've ever seen. I have been blessed to see the blueprints for this Lee's for the past six months prior to opening. I never really looked at the sq. footage of the place. There are tv's everywhere. Line is quick, food is quick and open 24 hours. I cannot complain. Some people might not like the Lee style sandwiches."}
{"text":"Neat place. I thought it was gonna be run down but surprisingly it we big and very modern. They had a huge drink selection and tons of little Asian snacks. I got the #38 on a croissant and it was pretty tasty. Place was clean and we didn't have to wait at all. Young man at the counter was super friendly too."}
{"text":"Smoothies and iced coffees are very rich in flavor. 
Had my first watermelon italian soda. I don't know about that one, felt like it was syrup for my deli man joos. Just kidding, but i swear it was a diabetic activator. Lol

Love their sandwiches. Buy 5 get 1 free.
*Just don't forget to check your order if your picking up, you may not have gotten your free sandwhich until you realize after a 15 min drive home :("}
{"text":"Love stopping here on the way to and from the strip. Their sandwiches are consistently good. I like the bread is soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. My fave is the BBQ pork sandwich. Their iced coffee is also delicious and strong. And you have to try their coconut waffle. Sooo good. All for decent prices."}
{"text":"So I've had enough fake and bad banh mi sandwiches here in Arizona that Lee's is a beacon of banh mi heaven if I have a craving for a Vietnamese style sandwich. I love the additional sweets and treats they offer now, including various packaged dried squid jerky (Yep, I used to snack on these all the time as a kid!), jelly rolls, mochi, and macarons ($1.25 each). The bubble tea is decent here, and the taro with boba I had today was light and refreshing. One of these days I'll try their manjoo- it looks pretty tasty! Upgrade one star!

P.S. Cash only but they do have an ATM in the store."}
{"text":"Great food!!! I love the coffee and hot and toasty bread.... They also have fresh sugarcane drink....Yum"}
{"text":"Mother of All that is great and good, this is the best place for sandwiches, they can do one thing to enhance their product though, and that's to toast the sandwich."}
{"text":"So you like Vietnamese food - banh mi, cafe sua da, che' but your favorite place closes at 9 pm? Well Lee's is your alternative. Unfortunately it's more an essence of Vietnam vs the real thing. Cafe sua da didn't taste strong, nor fresh and of the pastries we had none of them were Vietnamese in orgin - rather tasty but not the real thing. We avoided their banh mi as my sister-in-law thinks their bread is hard and they are light on the meat/vegetables. So overall it beats the alternative at  11pm at night but go to a real mom and pop Vietnamese place during normal hours and skip the corporate knock off."}
{"text":"Meh. I figured Spike Lee would make better sandwiches. There's nothing wrong with Lee's Banh Mi per se. It's just that there are so many other places in Vegas that make better Banh Mi for the same price. Why go to a chain when you can eat local? That's my philosophy anyway.

Granted, all we tried was the Banh Mi and their grand opening special 99c iced coffee. The iced coffee was more ice than coffee. I'm not sure why they bothered. Judging from what the guy said, they offer this grand opening \"special\" and then rip us off with basically a cup of ice. He made it sound like they are only making it like that today because it's a 99c special.

There are other items on the menu that might be worth trying. Fellow Yelper, Tony T, says that this location has way more stuff than other Lee's in California. If you've never been to a Lee's, it's probably worth checking out, if just to see what the fuss is all about. Otherwise, I see no reason to return.

p.s. I don't actually think this is a Spike Lee joint."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in a couple days ago to get my banh mi on. After watching the defeat of the NOMNOM truck on Great Truck Race on Food Network, my tummy was curious and I've heard from Cali friends that this was the go to spot. 

FYI I'm pesco-vegetarian and because my boyfriend will do whatever I tell him to, he also does not eat meat, so my selection was between the avocado, sardine and vegetarian. After standing in front of the menu for what seemed to be the greater part of my day I decided on the latter two. 

I honestly did not expect to get how much I did for only $6. I've never been a sandwich person but this beats Subway any day. I love Vietnamese food and flavors and here they were in a convenient little bread pocket, which they make fresh on the daily. 

I will definitely be coming back, maybe to try some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"I guess the best part about this restaurant is the fact that they're open 24 hours a day...oh and they've got free wi-fi. It usually doesn't get crowded so it's a great spot for little group meetings or homework crammings. Food-wise, if you're looking for quality, you don't want to be coming here. My mom ordered a sandwich. She had quite a hard time downing it because the baguettes were kinda hard and the veggies were dry and falling all over the place. Bobas could've been better except for all the ice that took up more than half of the cup. I used to go there simply for their green tea waffle (and samples) Recently, those things have been taken down for some reason...and then you find other places that serve better food. 

This wouldn't be the first place I'd run to for food but my opinion may be subjective, so you be the judge and go give it a try."}
{"text":"I love Lee's Sandwhich! Whenever I go there the service is pretty fast because it's not that busy. The place is super clean and very modern. 
I always order the #5 grilled pork sandwhich. It's soo good, and every time I come here it tastes the same. I think they have the best iced coffee as well! It's literally almost the strongest coffee I've ever had."}
{"text":"I had a friend pick up some #1 combo sandwiches and it was crispy delicious and just enough sauce. Bread was fresh and really crisp.  They called in the order and sandwiches were good to go. I think it is yummier than some of the lees in la."}
{"text":"Lee's! I loved you in Orange county...Your iced coffee, you little custard corn shaped filled pastry...Your dessert \"Che.\"  You've been open in Las vegas for oh...I guess at least 3 months now...I expect more from you having the history I do with you!

I use to go down to Orange county from Northern California and make it a point to stop by a Lee's for their great coffee and desserts.  There is one literally on every other street corner there.  Despite not accepting CREDIT CARDS, I would grab cash on the way just to stop by you.  What happened in vegas?

I know it takes business at least three months to settle in and offer consistent-tasting food. Its been that long yet I still am not a  fan of your sandwiches, vietnamese Ice coffee or pastries as I have been for at least 6 years now.  To the newbies, your sandwiches might taste good, but honestly, you have no consistency with your sandwiches.  The veggies are good but sometimes I don't get enough.  The bread is also very hard if you buy it to go and not get to it for a few hours.  

Readers, if you are familiar with myself, I love love coffee.  i love Vietnamese coffee even more.  The first time i walked into this place 3 months ago, the girl behind the counter asked me how I wanted my coffee because she can make it specifically to how i wanted it.  WRONG! Lee's coffee is generally pre-made, when ordered, it is just simply poured over ice.  There is a specific recipe that goes into making this drink.  The next few times they got the clue and had it pre-made.  Unfortunately, this coffee still lacks the taste that I remember receiving time and time again when ever I visited SoCAL.  

Because this place is family owned and operated, I would think that at the least, my coffee would taste as I recall it for many years.  I am sad to say that this Vegas location is incomparable to its sister locations i SoCAL.  


If its a late night and I am crazing my coffee and sandwich, I'd stop by.  Otherwise, I go to Hue Thai or Mr. Sandwich.  Please Lee's, Get better soon.  


 Sincerely your customer,
TTK 

PS: Pro's: One of the biggest locations I've been to, If you camp out, no one would notice.  ...That's about it."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR COFFEE! I see that everyone compares them to another location in other states, and I am like who cares? This place is HUGE, open 24 hrs, has great coffee and amazing sandwiches! My husband is a picky eater and loved the food! I talk about that coffee everyday! He ordered the Mocha iced coffee and I ordered Vanilla, both amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I love the fact they are open 24 hours and I can get a pretty good sandwich when I work late. The coffee drinks are weird, but I'm not really into Vietnamese coffee drinks. But that's not their fault.

I took off a star because they took away their frequent buyer's stamp cards, and said oh, it's an app now. And gave me no further instructions or a QR code as to where to get the app. While I was waiting for my food, there wasn't any app on their website. I f I have to look that hard, it's not worth it, and they clearly don't care about their frequent guests as much."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, heaven on earth. Their fresh bread is to die for, the meats (especially my favorites, the BBQ pork and grilled pork) are tasty, and the pickled veggies/cilantro/jalapeno make wonderful additions to these sandwiches. Although they only take cash, I am happy to do so because it is all so cheap. Also, the pork and shrimp egg rolls are great!"}
{"text":"Yummy and a great value. Love the pickled daikon and carrots in the grilled chicken sandwich. Smoothies are good. Ambiance is a little cold. Doesn't hold a candle to the Vietnamese sandwich shops in my native Hawaii."}
{"text":"As a Southern Californian, I wouldn't go to Lee's Sandwiches because there are just so many better and even cheaper Banh mi joints. However, in AZ, the options are pretty limited. Definitely helped curb my Banh mi cravings but the sandwiches were seriously skimpy. The mint milk was not minty at all but the fresh pressed nuoc mia (sugar cane juice)  was super refreshing."}
{"text":"Ugh, ever wanted to take a plunger and shove it on someone's mouth? Well I did...wanted to, that is. I was trying to order and correct my order I couldn't finish in the drive thru due to every other word being interrupted with \"is that all?\" NO. If it was I would say so dammit. So onto the food....errr...this is a love hate, like my shower and I during winter. Some is grrrreat, some is so bad I wanna punch it like a punching bag....uette. The breakfast ones rock, super affordable and really good. The baguette is always fresh and the damn sammich only costs $3.59. The issue here is this a Bahn Mi joint!!! Their Bahn mi basically sucks like a bag of Richards. Both OG pork and the raw chicken totally lack meat (maybe a good thing on the chicken one). However, the quality of veggies is spot on and abundant. I haaaaate to pull this card but living in California for over ten years I have been spoiled with the absolute best pork bahn mi sandwiches in the US. I have had so many, my number count would make an alley whore jealous. I know Lee's are all over like that jealous whore out in CA. Unfortunately this particular brick and mortar lacks in pride extensively and needs work. Work it Lee's, you got it, just strut it and show more gratification for what we know you can offer, like an escort instead of a whore :)"}
{"text":"As Sarah B notes in her review of this place, colonialism bad, impact of the chocolate and peanut butter sort of mesh of french and Vietnamese cuisine, amazing. As for Lee's  Banh mi (french baguette stuffed with various sorts of meats and vegetables), they seem to actually take a full size baguette and cut it in half for the sandwich whereas in most places I go they use a small mini-baguette, which I have to say, I prefer a bit more but for the price (my sandwich was like $3.50) I'm not going to complain too much and maybe it's more of a case of what I expect from a sandwich. If I took price into account I might go 4 starts but I wanted to focus purely on the experience of the food and that means, I would eat it again but if I could get one in the more traditional fashion, even if it cost me a bit more, I would go for that type Vietnamese sandwich.

What I did like is that one can also order full size baguettes at the same time the sandwich is ordered and like the sandwiches, quite inexpensive at only $1.25 each. I bought one and started eating it on the way home (yes, I know, crumbs everywhere but that is why they have those vacuums at the car wash). I could see picking up a loaf or two of this bread every weekend as I like the crunchy crust and the wonderfully soft interior of their loafs.

I also had an iced mint milk and well, that was rather blah, tasted overly sweet and artificial so not something I would order again but they have a lot of other options.

Bottom line....the bread is great, the sandwiches a great deal if you are looking for value for your money and an okay deal if you are looking for the highest quality Vietnamese sandwich. I would check out the Tea Light Cafe at Scottsdale 101 if you want to try a really good Vietnamese sandwich."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and good customer service! Recommend for sure! Lots of little snacks to try inside as well we will be back"}
{"text":"Don't get the negative reviews. Lee's has simple, cheap bahn mi and is open 24hrs."}
{"text":"Reading through all the reviews from here, I noticed a lot of people gave this place fairly low ratings. Despite that, I am giving this place 4 stars because the banh mi there was fresh and it was packed nicely with lots of veggies and meat. I also ordered a side of honeydew boba slush, which was okay. 

I do love the decor of the place. Very bright and modern with a clean atmosphere. This place is great for a quick lunch or a to go lunch."}
{"text":"Not impressed. A #4 and iced coffee left me feeling underwhelmed by the whole mediocre experience. Couple that with the price paid vs. portion size received and I left hungry and very disappointed. I don't care if the place is open 24 hours and people rave about it, I'm just not a fan. I may give them one more shot just to see if I had a one time bad experience, but my first impression was not good."}
{"text":"So I was around the Henderson area and I was starving! So I fired up my yelp and searched up food. It says lee sandwich was around the block and I said why not. So I got there. Place looks good. It's a mini version of the lees sandwich on spring mountain. I ordered no. 1 combination (my usual order) and large thai tea. I didn't like the drink. The texture was very thick and wasn't even cold enough. All that ice didn't do any good. As for my sandwich I thought yes! My sandwich. I'm hungry!!! I took a bite into it and it smelled and tasted expired. There was a certain meat in the sandwich that was expired. I gagged... Gross! Sucks I had to experience this. I like the one at spring mountain. I've never had an issue there. I'll just stick to that restaurant. Knock on wood!! That I don't ever experience this at the spring mountain location."}
{"text":"Lee's is not too shabby. I've been going since they first opened but hadn't gone in a while so I popped in last night.
The baguette bread is pretty hard so I go for the croissant, which just wasn't flaky and soft like I would have preferred but it wasn't hard either..
They have decent smoothies and I like that they offer a chicken/mushroom/egg steam bun vs. just usual pork..
It's a huge space, kind of a strange and unique sandwich shop. 
They seem to be doing something right here since they have lasted about four years..."}
{"text":"Delicious Banh Mi Sandwiches in Vegas!!  A Chinatown in Vegas, who knew? Back at home, I live about 1.5 miles from the mecca of Vietnamese food in the DC area (Eden Center), where there are tons of banh mi spots that everyone loves. My co-worker told me I had to try Lee's Sandwiches, and I was skeptical, but I knew he knew his food so I took a cab out to Chinatown.

Went inside, and it was definitely a different set up than what I am used to for a Vietnamese place. It offered Vietnamese and Euro sandwiches, but the star of the show here are obviously the Vietnamese offerings. So i got the special combo, with the eggrolls. The Banh Mi's were superb! Lots of flavor, the pate and pickled vegetables were on point, and the cuts of meat didn't taste cheap like some banh mi's can have. It actually tasted better quality than most, and was very filling! The baquette was crispy, crunchy, and very tasty. This was actually one of the best banh mi's I've had, and I've eaten plenty of different banh mis... From San Francisco, NYC, DC, and now, oddly Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sandwiches! Get 'em to go for the drive home to LA"}
{"text":"Stumbled here after grabbing Pho to cure our hangovers from the night before. I ordered the combo banh mi to go, for our flight back to Seattle, and the sandwiches are simple, the bread is fresh and it's better than any Subway. 

Tip for those who've had the authentic banh mi with pate...add a little soy sauce to your sandwich to boost up the umami. I thought the combo was a little bland, but then again I like my sodum."}
{"text":"This place reminded me of a Vietnamese \"McDonald's\".  It gives off a fast food restaurant vibe, but the way they set up their ordering lines seemed disorderly at times.  People were confused whether there were 3 separate ordering lanes or just one single line...

We had the egg rolls.  It was already pre-made and was sitting in the warming case/cabinet for lack of better words.  It was pretty weird that they didn't have any sauce for the egg rolls and lunchtime had just started...

We also had the grilled pork banh mi.  The sign said the sandwiches were 10 inches long and I initially thought it would be a good size sandwich.  Unfortunately, these baguettes were pretty thin or narrow.  The meat portion was ok, but more towards the slim side like the baguette.  haha.  The grilled pork was ok and wasn't bad...  The pickled vegetables were pretty good.  The sandwich was not soft and was not too hard, however, my upper palate was a little raw afterwards.

They were giving out samples of some type of waffle that had a green batter color in the inside.  That was surprisingly good.

Overall, this place was ok.  It wasn't horrible, however, I wouldn't come back, unless someone pulls my arm and asks me to give it another shot.  I've had better banh mi at other Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas and the fast food vibe didn't appeal to me."}
{"text":"Went here last week for lunch with the fiance.  We ordered the Bbq pork and a turkey hoagie w avocado and swiss.  I also got an iced americano, no sugar, no milk.   Our order took about 10-15 minutes to come out, but everything was correct and delicious! The coffee tasted good with nothing added.  The fresh baked rolls are delicious and for $3 the Bbq pork hoagie is such a great deal. I love the tender pork paired with the crunchy carrots and diakon with a hint of spice.  The turkey hoagie was typical, but tasty nonetheless.  We probably could've shared one and been satisfied.  I couldn't finish mine, but the fiance was more than happy to help! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Drove by this location (Rainbow Blvd & Robindale) many times and never bought anything until the last week. I saw the sign that \"Fresh baked French bread now available \" ... so I decided to go inside.

I absolutely wanted to buy their croissants what I liked from the original Lee's Sandwich on Spring Mountain Rd. 
They had it! Yes, I am so happy about this!
They serve oven fresh croissants small or large, french baguettes, all the sandwiches and drinks and little pastries.

There are some tables and chairs in the store, to eat in.
This time I ordered everything to go! So I don't know if they do table service or not, or everyone is doing self service. Next time I will spend more time there!
The store was very clean, including the floor and the counters. 
The two ladies were working at the time, were very polite. Service was fast."}
{"text":"I'm from the Bay Area where the first Lee's Sandwiches first opened, so I must say, it's an accomplishment that they'd open one down here. When the bread is hot and fresh it's really good, but once they're cooled, they're so freaking stale and  hard. I'm sitting at the tables eating the baguette sandwiches trying to chew on the bread as if I was a hobo that hasn't ate in forever. The only items that are actually good are the smoothies because it's actually something fresh. I recommend raspberry+carrot. I used to work there, so I made a lot of concoctions. I suggest the italian sodas too. Oh, and avoid the fat old man that cashiers sometimes. He's so rude and doesn't handle customers well. He makes everyones first experiences at Lee's a complete and total disaster. 

If you're someone who wants to order wings/eggrolls. Call ahead of time before you come in, they say it takes \"5-10 minutes\" it actually takes like 20.. And, there's no wifi, even though the website says they do. They don't."}
{"text":"Who the heck needs fast food when you can have Lee's?  A six-inch BBQ pork sandwich on a freshly made baguette with daikon, pickled carrot, cilantro and jalapeno for $3.10!  Add a brain-jarring, caffeine and sweetened condensed packed iced Vietnamese coffee for $2.75 and you are set to go for hours!!

Service always quick and friendly.  Place is spotless.  But bring cash."}
{"text":"I was told that Lee's sandwiches was coming. I can finally get a decent sandwich. Well, Lee's sandwiches is here, that is true. Someone let me know when the decent sandwich arrives too. A big over rated I would say. It's pricey and I hate toasted Bahn Mi. I used to love getting them at the SF Market on Decatur and Spring Mtn but they ran out of business. Darn, they were really good and cheap! I much rather pay Lee's prices for theirs versus Lee's. It's an insult to my last name. And I don't even own the joint. Enough said. But you might like it. Some people like it and think it is good. I just think it is a skinny sandwich, average at best. Sure they have the same ingredients that you find in a regular Bahn Mi but you can just go here or Hue Thai and it would still be the same or better and cheaper. What's it with me and cheap? Writing these reviews, I can't help but notice I keep saying good and cheap. Oh wait, those are the places I like. Nevermind."}
{"text":"Banh mi was ok. Not the best I've had from a Lee's Sandwich chain. BF loved it..lol..he ate one of turkey ones and a chicken Banh mi, but will be good on a late night creep."}
{"text":"? My number five sandwich was delicious! The baguette was soft and fluffy, the mayo was fatty and nommy combined with the barbecue flavored meat and fresh cilantro makes me wish I could eat this every day :( why. Why can't I?? Lol. And can't go wrong w good ol taro smoothie (I like the artistically flavored of taro which is kind of tastes like vanilla)."}
{"text":"Love this new location! They serve all the same menu items as their location on spring mountain. It was clean and well organized. Also you cant been 24 hours! I will be stopping here whenever I have a craving for baguettes and vitnamese coffee!"}
{"text":"So I went to Lee's Sandwiches for the first time today. Got the #27 turkey club. It was and alright sandwich. It was kind of dry and the baguette was kind of hard. The cheese slices were basically Kraft singles. All in all, it was totally a sandwich that I could make at home especially when it was almost $6. The place has a good assortment of snacks though so maybe I'll go back for that but as far as going back and eating a sandwich, no. Also be aware that this place is CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Stay away! Quality is bad, took them 25 minutes to make 4 sandwiches. Ordered them heated, only 2/4 was heated. The other tasted like they just came out of the fridge.

The \"Special\" is especially bad! The pork roll has barely any pork, full of fillers."}
{"text":"This is the worst Lee's sandwiches store. I ordered banh mi with grilled pork. They gave me a piece of banh mi with barely any meat inside. Looks exactly like a kid meal. Then I asked the guy hand me my food for some soy sauce. He asked 1 guy inside if he had a bottle of soy sauce around. That guy replied: \"He want my ass?\" then hide himself in the kitchen cuz he knew I heard that. Poor small kid"}
{"text":"There needs to be a 24/7 viet sub place in boston. the bread was so good! crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. i ordered the banh mi thit nguoi and was super happy. i also ordered a loaf to go and was surprised it was only $1.75!  i wish that the coffee was available not frozen. i also liked the snack options."}
{"text":"Once one of my favorite, most amazing places, now a trip to Lee's typically ends with a slight feeling of disappointment. Lee's does not take debit or credit cards, and Lee's does not offer free drink refills. Worse, they serve in small cups that are PACKED with ice. It's kind of insulting. 
The bread for the sandwiches *is* fantastic. The amount of meat used in the banh mi could be better. I always order extra meat... 3 years ago, it was noticeable. These days, it almost seems like you get less meat if you pay for extra! D: Of course the roast pork Banh Mi is tasty tasty, but give the European sandwiches (croissants) a whirl too! I especially love the  roast beef! Also, big flatscreens playing FOX NEWS is kind of difficult to look at while dining... this should be a 2 star review, because of that! :P"}
{"text":"they have yummy little fried bits of heaven. There iced coffee is like rocket fuel! Whenever iam there the place is empty tho, the service is a little weird, whenever i give my order the say \"and then\" i always have to say ;uh thats it thats all. I work close by,  but that's the only reason i ever go there. The sandwiches are dry and meh."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Open 24 hours so when you stumble drunk out of the karaoke bar at 3am you've got a place to soak up the booze."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches.  The croissants are the best, buttery & flaky, yum! Cash only, but not much, you can easily get a meal for under $10. One of their turkey & cheese croissants is enough to fill me up. A little loud at lunch time, but still fast and good. Plentiful outdoor seating too (with misters the summer heat). Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!

Fresh sandwiches from Lees sandwiches is definitely a great way to start your day or enjoy your afternoon! Paired with a smoothie boba drink and bam! Instant happy Ines's in your tummy!

Service here is always that of interacting with a highschool student asking for your order but the space is clean and I swear is always playing episodes of Friends. 

Order a BBQ pork sandwich and a mango smoothie with boba if you trust me :)"}
{"text":"Walked in and the place was nice but deserted, good for me cuz i got my order quickly. Staff was friendly. Bread was good but lacking in meat and fillings."}
{"text":"Love how this store is open 24 hours. Anytime I need a boba drink or a yummy sandwich late at night or early morning this is the spot!

Spacious inside with plenty of tables to sit and eat. Also a great spot to chill with a few friends. 

I usually order a large ube boba drink. Now I saw they are advertising a few new drinks including green tea frappe. Fell in love with the green tea frappe and I added boba to it. 

Some of the food I order are the lees sandwich combo. I usually order my sandwich with the croissant buns. Has a nice taste to it. Their chicken wings are also great too!"}
{"text":"Really hate doing this but when your order is completely bypassed, it results in this. I have a life. I have kids. My kids have a bed time. I don't have time to sit and wait for them to realize they've been skipping my number for 20 minutes. I spoke up & requested a refund because I have an order ready available for me at Starbucks, thanks to the convenience of the mobile app. 

I spoke with Erick the manager who didn't really seem to care much. I told him his workers were standing around chatting while I was waiting. I probably won't be back unless someone else is paying. They won't get my money anymore."}
{"text":"great place.  Some advice

1. bring cash - they don't take credit cards.   They do this to save money, the credit card company takes a big cut.   To those people who don't want to bring 4 dollar cash, I know its a lot of money maybe bring an armored car?   

2. The bagette sandwich bread is crusty some call it \"hard\".   Some people (me) like it that way.  If you like soft bread stay away or get croissante sandwiche.

3. Some of the baked goods are good. 

4. The sandwiches are inexpensive but don't have a huge amount of meat.   Again I like this - just telling you."}
{"text":"the food was slightly a lesser quality than many of the other stores I have visited, but they get 3 stars for me because they seemed disorganized. the man who took our order had to keep going back to explain the cook how to make the sandwich, and the 3rd employee sat on the counter where food orders are placed and hopped over it rather than go around to the service door. also they have charges for everything."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Lee's, and I will definitely be going back! The place is clean, and the staff is friendly and very efficient. 
I ordered the vegetarian asian sandwhich. It is simply amazing. The bread and ingredients are fresh.They are also very reasonably priced. I got 2 10in vegetarian sandwhiches for 7$. 

Love it!"}
{"text":"First off, this place will only accept cash so make sure you have cash on hand. Other than that they make some amazing Báhn Mi! If you are unfamiliar with Bahn Mi, it's a Vietnamese sandwich using a baguette bread. \"Báhn\" means: bread and \"Mi\" means: wheat. 

I would definitely recommend getting their #11 which is the special combo loaded with everything. (Cold cut meat: sliced pork, pork bellies, pork sausage, liver pâté, head cheese) and some veggies for garnish (cilantro, carrots, jalapeño and cucumbers). These are definitely easy to eat and tasteful! I usually always order 5+ every time I visit because it's so good and we don't have this in Tucson! 

Also if you check in on Yelp, you get one free Vietnamese coffee. Which is a strong iced espresso drink with condense milk! Also another recommendation. 

The only downfall is the price is a bit high from what I've see in California. A sandwich running approximately $5 a sandwich and in California it's approximately $3-$4 a sandwich. 

\"Taste it, love it, Yelp it!\""}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go to pick up banh mi's and spring rolls on the way back.

Usually on our way back to Los Angeles, we'll get lunch to go and munch on it in the car. 

The food is decent for the price, but I don't recommend the drinks. Their Ice coffee is filled with exactly what it states - Ice. (not a lot of coffee) and the lychee smoothie (the drink I had last time) didn't taste good at all. Just too fattening... Also prices keep RISING........ What happened to the old Lee's? Thankfully I live in LA, and can easily access the Lee's around here."}
{"text":"This place was pretty close to where I live so I thought I would check it out. I got the egg rolls and the combination special. The egg rolls were good but a bit pricey. The banh mi could have been a bit better. I thought the bread was a little tough."}
{"text":"Came here because it was highly recommended and I'm glad I did. I had the #4 grill pork sandwich with a Vietnamese iced coffee and it was very good. Will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. I ordered small frappe which was under five dollars. I give my credit card and get \"Oh, I have to charge you 50 cents to using a credit card under 5 dollars\" from cashier. But there's no sign notifying customers about that. It's a lunch time, I am with friends and in a rush, so I am more collaborative and I ask if larger frappe will cost more than five dollars. He says, \"It's $4.75. Then I am going to charge you 25 cents\". So this is just a subjective bullshit he's pulling out. I call it an unacceptably bad customer service.

On the frappe quality: it was highly unremarkable. Lots of ice.

They call in the mic your number if it's ready and repeat it multiple times. Very annoying.

I really wanted to stop by some other time to try their sandwiches, but I lost the desire after such treatment."}
{"text":"I went here with my daughter and we had a good time. The sandwiches are made from fresh bread that is made there. I liked how they call your number over the intercom when your order is ready. The only thing that is wrong with this place is that they do not take debit or credit cards unless is a order of $50.00 or more. They have a ATM in the corner for people to use. Who has a business and does not take cards ?"}
{"text":"Bahn mi. It's such a strange choice for a favorite food. It smacks of pretentious doucheyness found in the worst of all foodies: \"Well, if I had MY choice for a meal, it would DEFINITELY be the scottish red-legged partridge found at The French Laundry followed by their DIVINE jivara-caramel roulade.\"

Go get a hobby and a sense of scale, Buttmunch.

And yet, I can't deny that bahn mis are one of my favorite foods. The mix of crusty starches, savory meats and piquant herbage is a combination bestowed to us from the gods above.  Just the fact that I typed that last sentence makes me want to give myself a much-deserved cockpunch.

So, after an aborted attempt to eat at Pizzeria Bianco, it was with much interest and anticipation that I walked into Lee's Sandwiches.  I was only dimly aware of Lee's the Chain due to the inevitable comparisons West Coast ex-pats have made of a local (to Atlanta) bahn mi shop named \"Lee's Bakery.\" In an interesting twist of reverse reviewing, I've turned the tables on them thar Lee's.

First thought.  Bright. Shiny, even. It was 8:30 at night and I feel like I walked into a three dimensional anime. I ordered the BBQ pork combo and a side of fried spring rolls. Oh, it's cash only. Fortunately, I've got it and I noticed the ATM inhouse. But dammit, this screws up my expense reporting for work. Oh well.

The order doesn't take long to arrive. I sit and assess. The fried spring rolls are awesome. In fact, to my Filipino eye, the look (and ultimately taste) like lumpia. Mmmmmm.....lumpia. But as for the sandwich? It was......okay. I've had better. (Sigh.) The baguette was crunchy and soft in all the right places. I could probably eaten a few more loaves of that stuff. But, speaking of stuff, the stuffing, the interior of the sandwich was lacking. The meat portion was almost minuscule or at least compared to my hometown Lee's it was. Still, a mediocre bahn mi is still a good sandwich in my book. Three stars as far as bahn mis go, but four stars compared to other places in general."}
{"text":"I could not be more disappointed. For years we have been driving from west Phoenix to Chandler just to get the sardine sandwich. It's my favorite. So when we found out that Lee's was opening up ten minutes from our house I was very happy. I thought I could go get my sardine sandwich any time I wanted. Today we got there and they don't serve sardines at this location. WTF? Never going back. The thing that really ticks me off is that the sardine sandwich is printed right on the paper menu. But they don't have it. So wrong."}
{"text":"All I wanted was avocado smoothie with boba. Got this tall cup of pretty much just an ice slushie instead with boba for $5... Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I had bad experience over here so many time. The sandwich is cold & thick bread doesn't taste good but it s still ok for me because I love their coffee. I came back here on January 10,2018 at 2:30. The Asian girl made me a waffle from my order & it took her 15' minutes. I had to come to remind her about my order that she already for forgot. But the coconut waffle came out so bad in broken pieces & saggy bad. I track it in anger which made me regret to return it for her to eat that disgusting food."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and coffee. There egg rolls and chicken wings are good too. Nice clean restaurant. I go here every week."}
{"text":"very clean comfortbale place.ordered #33?yummy?and love the Lees hot coffe?will come again."}
{"text":"Once you walk in, there's a very very bad stench and it's SUPER HOT inside!!! Felt so gross in that restaurant"}
{"text":"I love banh mi and needed to get my fix while on vacation, so I had to stop by Lee's Sanwhich!  My favorites are the combination and grilled pork.  I got both and shared half of both with my Mom.  The fresh baguette is always the best plus the pickled veggies and jalapeños nicely compliments to the flavor of the sandwhich!  I love love loveee their iced coffee, but decided to their fresh passion and get the coffee to go.  The passion fruit was fresh squeezed and sweet to perfection.  It was the perfect drink for such a hot day on the strip.

The only disappointment was there weren't many Vietnamese baked goods or desserts displayed for sale around the store, which there usually are at other locations.  Maybe we came too early at 10am, but it is always open, so unsure about that.

Lee's Sandwich never disappoints and I'm glad to know I can get mt banh mi fix every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is crap. Reason for two stars is because I still like their sandwiches. They took 20 mi. To make my sandwiches. They got through 10 orders and mine is still in the process of finishing. 
One of the girl is so freakin lazy. I asked her if she can just cut my sandwiches in half and she said we have a plastic knife hat is no where to be found. I had to ask her for one. 
One of my order came out wrong. On the outside wrapper they even wrote egg bacon and cheese. But my sandwich was ham and cheese. 
And this order was a total of $45! Just for sandwiches and still messed up. Good job Lee."}
{"text":"24hr Lee's Sandwich?! Oh yeah! Great latenight snack in the desert. A BBQ sandwich and ice coffee always hits that special spot. The French bread here is always a must have when coming here, pairing it with their signature ice coffee is like having a party in your mouth! 

Another specialty is the Durian shake, if you don't know what it is its a fruit that grows primarily in Asia and is popular in the Philippines. You either live it or hate it but in order to know you got to try it! 

I've been to the original location in Orange County as well as several other chains so I have a pretty good scope on most of their locations. This location is cool because it's 24hrs BUT it's not regularly cleaned, the tables and chairs are mostly dirty. The service around 1am is rather slow which is understandable considering less people work the graveyard shift. Other than that I will definitely stop by again during my latenight visit."}
{"text":"I just had Lee's for lunch today ... the Egg Salad... and as usual, it was amazing!  $3.19 for a full egg salad with tomatoe on a bagette and a pickle.. how can you go wrong with that?"}
{"text":"So back in the 19th century, a bunch of Catholic dudes were the OG hipsters, all up in SE Asia's business (before America made it cool) to establish \"French Indochina\". They said something along the lines of \"This Viet food is delicious, but it'd go better inside le baguette!\" 

And here we are in the year 2015, where I can order delicious banh mi, that is, some decent bread with fresh pickled onions/carrots and a little grilled pork. If one would like to be an absolute wuss, they can go with some European cold-cut sandwich with ham or something. I enjoyed my #5 even if at times I thought I was biting into just bread. For less than $8, I washed it down with a very refreshing avocado smoothie. Next time, I've gotta try the sugar cane juice! Or all the groovy baked goods they've got in the little shop by the register. 

Imperialism never tasted so good. 

PS-Cash or GTFO"}
{"text":"Who would have thought an Asian Sandwich place would be so nice.

1.  Great sandwiches. There are a lot of different ones to try,the taste is not just focused on the meat but the fillings. Seems that they really have the fillings, the spices and the flavor just right. We tried the below sandwiches and they were all very nice!

Lee's Combination
Cured Pork Roll
Pork Roll with Pate
Pate
Grilled Pork

2.  The Bread - Really the best part. Nothing like a sandwich on Baguette.

3.  The coffee - Ordered some Vietnamese coffee to go with the condensed milk.  Nice.

4.  Free Wifi - That is nice.

5.  Variety - It is great to see the variety of asian style foods coming to Las Vegas and the plethora of Vietnamese sandwich places is great and this one is very clean.

Gotta check it out or just go for the coffee!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and even better prices! Got 2 sandwiches for less than $9! I asked for a recommendation and got the pork Asian sandwich. It was delicious- the flavor was great and loved the bread. My boyfriend got the #11 Asian combination and liked it except for the head cheese on it. Heads up only cash is accepted!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of home. Most people think of pho when it comes to Vietnamese food. Well, banh mi is also a popular staple food. Even though this place is 30 miles away from where I live, I have to stop by when I'm in Chandler. I get a toasty baguette that is perfect for lunch and dinner all for the price of $3.49. That's as cheap as it gets. Around Glendale, the banh mi ranges from $4 up to $7. It is no surprise that I buy multiple banh mi when I'm at Lee's to stock up, and share some with friends.  

My favorite is the banh mi thit nuong (grilled pork sandwich). It's hard for me to eat all of it in one sitting, so I usually split the sandwich in half and eat the rest later. My boyfriend likes the banh mi cha lua pate (pork roll pate). I absolutely love the Vietnamese iced coffee. Be forewarned that it is strong! So strong that my heart races sometimes, but I simply can't resist it's unique taste that can't be found at your regular coffee shops. 

Love this place. Fast service and great food. Nice place to stop by for lunch if you are at work. They provide you with free wifi - password on the receipt. Make sure you also bring some cash since they do not accept credit card - cash only."}
{"text":"Needs more employees food isn't fresh , sandwich was burnt bacon was burnt egg rolls tasted old smoothie was watery"}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place two minutes ago.  It was my first time and had a horrible experience.  I had no idea that this is a cash only place, after completing my order verbally the cashier informed cash only! I'm starving so he pointed to the ATM machine inside, I reluctantly walked up to machine because I knew there would ATM fees but didn't care.  Sure enough, I see a message on the screen saying \"dispensing error\" after agreeing to pay $1.75 in fees to withdraw $20.  Cash did not dispense, I got a print out clearly showing the amount deducted from my account.  I also logged into my mobile banking app and it showed the ATM transaction that funds had been deducted but it was pending. 

I returned to the cashier and showed him the transaction on my mobile banking app, he basically said \"wait for 3-5 days...\" For a refund!!! What???? I couldn't believe the response! Later, he said that it was not their machine! It's on your damn property inside the restaurant, but he didn't care! 

Typical rude and unprofessional service, gangnam style!!! 

Forget this place and DO NOT use their ATM!!!!"}
{"text":"Lee's is a terrific and authentic Vietnamese Banh Mi (sandwich) shop located across the street from Lee Lee Market at the corner of Warner and Dobson.

They've got a bunch of stuff on the menu but I always order the same thing, the #11 Special which runs a whopping $3.15.

You get a very fresh foot long baguette with a few slices of processed pork and lots of fresh vegies and cilantro.  It's quick, delicious and refreshing.

It's a cleaned up version of pretty much any Hanoi Banh Mi joint, which is to say, it's just fine."}
{"text":"Came here straight from the airport in need of some strong coffee and a sandwich to kick off our house hunting trip. I have been wanting to visit a Lee's for a long time but could never seem to get there until now. It was worth the wait and now that I am moving to Chandler, I can go whenever I want!!

I am a huge fan of banh mi and my husband likes them too but is new to the concept. So I ordered him the grilled pork vietnamese sandwich and ordered myself a pork and pate one. The combo sandwich I wanted was not available but this did not dampen my experience. The bread the sandwiches are served on is special. Its creamy, flavorful, soft on the inside, slightly crisp on the outside. The meats inside are very good but they take second stage to the bread in my opinion. My mom complains that they skimp on the fillings but I didn't find that to be the case for me. A sandwich with bread that good would be overwhelmed by too much meat. For me, I felt the sandwich was balanced perfectly with the right amount of meat, pickled veggies, cilantro, and jalapeno.

Of course, we ordered the iced coffees which hit the spot and got us energized for our long afternoon. Next time I would order a large one because they really pack the cup full of crushed ice (this makes it nice and cold) so you don't get as much coffee."}
{"text":"Maybe if they turn the music down a little, they ll be a ale to hear what the customers really want. Instead of making customer yell over the big glass thingy in front of the registers."}
{"text":"Love their baked breads and combination sandwiches! Food is pretty good service fast and okay, lots of tables and a mini shop with lots of Asian snacks and drinks inside as well. Open 24 hrs as well! Good for late night cravings."}
{"text":"Always a destination stop for iced cofee and the best banh mi sandwiches. Resist not for you will always walk away satisfied."}
{"text":"Reading all the reviews for barely opening up. First comparing to the other location, obviously they have been open for years and of course it's a well oiled machine over there. 

In my experience every restaurant that has opened on the first day has never been perfect it takes them a couple months. Of course everyone thinks I can do it better, or I would have been prepared. Well they can either bake the bread 2 days before or prepare everything Day of. You just have to wait, simple. 

As for the workers smiling even though they tell you they have run out of bread or etc. what do you want them to do looked pissed off. They are doing the best they can to accommodate. I'm sure there is a review here already that someone is saying the workers were rude or they didn't smile. 

I had great customer service here by a couple of workers. The line was constantly moving and we only had to wait about 15 mins for our sandwiches.  The  original iced coffee was great as well. Everything was very clean and organized! 
I'm sure in a couple of months Lees will be a smooth running machine and everyone complaining won't actually drive to chandler. 

Keep up the great work and keep smiling"}
{"text":"I love Lee's Sandwiches.  They are affordable.  They have real Banh Mi ingredients.  They are made quickly and consistently.  They are addictive and unique in flavoring compared to all of the other sub shop offerings.  

We went here for a few reasons.
1. It pleases everyone.  Even the more picky eaters in our group.
2. It's affordable.  
3. We don't have one in our town.  We need one.
4. It was gonna be quicker than the other options mentioned.

This particular one seemed just like all of the other Lee's I have been in.  A little different layout, but basically the same.  Fast food style ordering and just barely longer timeframes than most fast food.  It did have some nice TV's though. 

Service was the standard mildly gruff businesslike service I get at most Asian places.  

I always order #16 and #1 and #18.  I especially like the pate.  I get it so rarely, I get it when I can.  The bread is the star on these sandwiches too.  Just perfect for what is being made.

Lee's Sandwiches has perfected Banh Mi for the masses.  Is it as good as fancy Banh Mi you might get at some restaurant for $10?  Nope.  But this is food for the people.  

Head up though.  If there is a low carb eater in your party.  They may just not find anything to eat.  This place is packed with enough carbs to prep the Boston Marathon."}
{"text":"I get the BBQ Pork which is good. The Jalapeños are fresh and hot so they pack a punch...which I like but stay away if you don't like heat. The bread is usually good but occasionally it can be just a touch stale and your jaw starts getting a little sore by the end. Still, overall a nice change of pace from other sandwich places."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place isn't rated higher than it is.  Walked in with my Dad on a Saturday afternoon hungry.  No line, no crowd.  Ordered up four sandwiches for me and the fam, and the cashier politely let me know that I get a free fifth one.  Don't mind if I do, yo.  They were done in no time and we took the bag of goodies home.  I sat with my Dad in silence, eating my grilled pork sandwich.  Downright delicious.  What really makes a sandwich is the bread...this French bread was perfection.  Again, perfection.  I will definitely visit Lee's again when I'm in Vegas visiting fam and I am patiently awaiting for a Lee's franchise to open up in San Diego.  I knocked one star off only because it's cash only and I bet the ATM machine charges a human pinky in ATM fees."}
{"text":"Lets start with.. at least they get your Thai Tea to you when you order it not like *PHO KIM LONG* OTL

OK now with that out of the way lets start the review..

I was anticipating the arrival of Lee's Sandwiches due to a ton of people praising the place. 

The bread was so HARD that it cut the roof of my mouth! 
The lights were dreadful to stay in!
The intercom kept playing the same annoying commercial every dang second! 

The servers were at least nice and welcoming when I was there. 

Lets just say only reason I'll go back is for the THAI TEA and soft serve

2stars just for the Thai Tea.. lol"}
{"text":"Lots and lots of sandwich choices but the Vietnamese sub disappointed me... The place is not bad, has a lot of seats and waiting area to order your sandwich. They offer a few desserts including pandan waffles and creme filled dough balls which they make in front of you.
I just could not grasp the taste and texture of their signature baguettes... I get that they make it in house but it has nothing on the French baguettes I have grown so accustom to eating.
I haven't returned since the first visit... Maybe one I'll give it another try but for now, I'm good."}
{"text":"My last night in Vegas and this place was my last resort.

Had plans to check out Crab Corner, but the kitchen closed at 10.
I wanted to go Kinh Do,but too late,closed!! 
So I see the flashing lights At this place, so I guess it's Banh Mi time!!

I remember my very first time eating here, ( 2 years ago) 
I was very amazed by this place!!
( how huge ( Banh mi), cheap, and how their Banh mi taste so yummy!!)

Today's visit, I'm beginning to have doubts......

The lady cashier didn't quite understand my order. ? 
The prices has gone up, from my last visits...

After 9 pm. They charge additional, 25 cents per item!! 

The place doesn't look very nice, - dirty and messy, since my last visit. 

I order 2 Banh Mi, : pork and pâté and grilled chicken.
The sandwich is huge!! ( can't beat that! in Hawaii- it cost over 5.00 and for half the size of Mr. Lee's sandwich) I give this sandwich and 3 out of 5 stars! 

I also got 2 orders of iced coffee, the coffee is good but they put way too much crushed ice!! There wasn't much coffee!! I don't know why they do this?? 

Only One good reason, not to complain, free wi-fi!! 

Hmmmmm. I'm not sure if I will visit  a Mr. lee's Sandwich again??"}
{"text":"Great ice blended coffee, the cream cone pastry is awesome and the #6 is my favorite. The service is just service but to be expected since you are in china town."}
{"text":"1st timers here.  The husband ordered a combo and I had a grilled pork sandwhich and Thai tea.  Other than the bread being tiny (is it just me?) the sandwhiches were just.. Meh. Thai tea is always good. Price was pretty decent. Then again, coming from Hawaii to Vegas, everything here is pretty well priced! Now lets get to the part why 3 stars are missing. The smell of the restaurant was HORRID. smelled like a dead pig or garbage.  I don't know if that's normal cuz it's in Chinatown? No. Can't be. We walked in a few other restaurants and they were fine.  I have yet to try the other sandwhiches but I think I'll check out the one on Eastern."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Love the sandwiches that always feed me up but take a little to long to cook cause they have just 2 cook at night but no complaints for open 24/7 love it."}
{"text":"I always get a Vietnamese iced coffee with boba. Delish. However, I don't like their Thai tea. 

Get party wings from here. For a snack, 5 pieces for about $3 or 20 pieces for $12 (much cheaper than Long Wongs or any wing place)."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were good and bread was fresh. Service was friendly but  I was a bit peeved by the fact that they didn't fully honor the Yelp Deal ($12 for $20).  The cashiers didn't know anything about the deal advertised on Yelp and didn't know how process the offer and didn't allow me to use the full $20.  I got tired of explaining how it worked and just gave in. I may go there for the sandwiches again but won't be buying any Groupons or Yelp deals for this place."}
{"text":"Upon the recommendation of a friend, went here for some boba. Just ordered their ice coffee boba, ice coffee mocha, and hot mocha--they had a special of \"buy 2, get 1 free.\" 

I had the ice coffee boba--the coffee was already mixed with condensed milk. I tasted decent but nothing I'm crazy about, and the boba could have been better if it wasn't buried in all the small pieces of ice (which took up 75% of the cup).

The BF had the ice coffee mocha... he thought it was just okay. To me, it was more tastier than mine. 

And finally, the hot mocha (which I had a little later lol--I'm a coffee addict, what can I say? haha), now, THAT was friggin delish!!! Next time we're in Vegas and we have the extra time and if we're passing by the place, I'll stop by and order that with boba."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I don't normally eat bread, but this bread was worth eating! I have never had a Vietnamese sandwich, so I wanted to try it. It was like an Asian salad on a tasty baguette. They make their own bread.

Lee's has a drive-thru option and regular non-Asian sandwiches too. 

I can't wait to come back to try the breakfast sandwiches on croissants and their coffee too! Friendly service and reasonable prices. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I ordered the Asian combo meal. Let me tell you the egg rolls were phenomenal and my grilled pork sandwich is to die for. I am highly impressed with the food and the price point on most things is reasonable.  It's a really kool vibe in here with a store where you can buy lots of Asian snacks and smoothies as well.  As I finish my sandwich I'm already craving another."}
{"text":"Very cheap sandwiches but poor quality just like the California stores.  It's basically just the cheapest stuff you can get away with buying and putting them all in a sandwich. 

For the price it's not bad - but if you're looking for quality it's a wasted meal."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that my favorite part of Lee's is by far the french baguettes. Being an east coast transplant, it's hard to find good bread (by which I mean chewy interior, crusty-but-not-stale exterior). This place has done a great job and I will likely return just for that.

I tried the bahn mi, since it seems to be a house specialty, and I found it lacking flavor. The Roast Beef & Cheese was better, although I tasted cheese more than the thin amount of roast beef they put on. Next time I'd order extra meat. I can't complain at the prices either, $3-$5 for a sandwich is good, and $1.25 for a baguette to take home is better than local grocery stores in price and flavor.

Thanks to those who warned about no refills (I went to Circle K across the street for a soda) and the cash only environment."}
{"text":"I have to say I am pretty disappointed, I have been going to Lees for about 15 years when I lived in California. When they opened in vegas on spring mountain I was thrilled and when they opened here on eastern I was overjoyed since I reside in anthem. I waited to post because I wanted to give the benefit of doubt the previous times I stopped in. This is now my third time and it is the same, the sandwiches are nothing but bread. My 3 year old son asked where the meat was, I hope they begin to do better maybe they are having a hard time with food cost, but non the less you shouldn't charge people almost $5 for nothing but bread. At least lather more mayo or pickled vegetables. Something"}
{"text":"I have waited over a year for Lee's to open and be ready when I heard there was one being opened . 

I decided to check it out when I moved back to Vegas today from Hawaii and I must admit the food was just as I remembered from all of the times I went to Lee's in California . The only difference was the staff . They were a little cranky and were not the best of help when it came to questions my friends had .

Besides that if you like Vietnamese sandwiches , try Lee's . The #4 grilled chicken is amazing !"}
{"text":"I've came here a couple of times to get my vietnamese sandwich kick. Can't complain for the price plus it hits the spot every time I'm craving it. The baguette bread they use is always fresh with the perfect crunch. I could it that alone! I always get the chicken sandwich or the pork with pate. BOMB!
 
Staff is always cool, polite and professional. Cool spot to kick it if you wanna grab a bite to eat with some friends or your fam. 

If your in the area, try it!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches at great prices! Definitely will be a staple of mine whenever I need a quick bite to eat or a sit down sandwich for dinner"}
{"text":"My first time here. They have such Good foods. Is the great place to stop by chilling & stuff everyone stomach"}
{"text":"The pro: the only Lee's Sandwiches in Arizona
The con: the only Lee's Sandwiches in Arizona

Had a huge hankering for a Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and missing home where Lee's presence is abundant. Lee's has a pretty large menu, which is typical and sells everything from sandwiches, drinks, pastries, snacks to desserts.

Came in to order a #10 Cured Pork & Pork Sandwich, typically most Banh Mi's come with slices of Jalapeno, Cilantro, Pickled Carrot and Daikon, slathered with mayo and Pate and stuffed with cured meats, such as Cha Lua (cured pork sausage) or other types of deli ham encased in a French baguette. My sandwich was sorely lacking, with only two springs of cilantro, one slice of Jalapeno and literally 4 thinly sliced pieces of ham. Absolutely disappointed, all this in a 10 inch baguette.

I also ordered a Jackfruit Smoothie with boba and found the smoothie absolutely watered down and super sweet. The boba was also not well cooked and not flavored.

Definitely disappointed in my experience here. Spent $ on food served with the bare minimum of quality and service.

This place is also CASH ONLY. If you're a plastic carrying gal like me, you might have to suffer with paying a fee to withdraw from their ATM in the corner."}
{"text":"Yum, yum and more yum. I work near China town, so my co workers and I go to Lee's in China town all the time. It is great, so when they opened this one down near where I live in the Southwest, I jumped all over it. The bread is fresh and the sandwiches are amazing. They also have great smoothies, my favorite is pineapple coconut. They also have cool chinese candies and snacks that they sell. Every time I go I grad some for the kiddos. This is a cool place and good food. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop. French baguettes are great! The only reason I gave them a 4 is because they always seem to give me the wrong drink. It doesn't matter what I order I always get something different."}
{"text":"I love this place! The sandwiches are really large. A small is big enough to share for two people. The Italian soda is sweet but good. 

They sell all kinds of Asian snacks and sweets. They also have a large collection of bake goods. All sandwiches come with a pickle for on the side.  So if you hate pickles like me, make sure to ask of them not on the side."}
{"text":"Sometime the bum is not crunchy and the spicy flavor is not enough. i am not sure if it is because of different people making it or the equipments were not stable. So i got some surprises once in a while, not a big deal."}
{"text":"The baguettes are incroyable, incredible, fantastic, amazing.  They have a hint of sweetness, are not rock hard, and I couldn't stop eating them.

I saw literally every single person in the place drinking an iced coffee.  I absolutely had to order one if everyone else was.  I was not disappointed.  In fact, I had the best iced coffee of my life.  There was something about it.  It was strong but not black, dirty, bitter, weak, or sour.  Mixed with a hint of condensed milk and poured over an entire cup of crushed ice, this iced coffee was amazing."}
{"text":"The baked goods are out of the this world.  The service is fast and the sandwiches are huge.  I had to remove a star because they only take cash.  I would have bought some of the items in the front of the store but I did not have enough cash.  I also removed a star because the spring rolls were very chewy, tasted old and the Thai Ice Tea was mostly ice and small.  I will go again to get a sandwich though because it was delicious."}
{"text":"Why did I even bother trying this place again?! 

Figured maybe it will do for a late bahn mi craving and remembered it was alright enough the first time. The sign in the front for the bread being baked fresh was promising, but we got stale chewy bread that made it hurt to chew after a while....and I love chewy things like jerky but this wasn't fun. Got the vegetarian and the filling isn't really substantial and more like crispy bean curd crisps, rice crisps and the usual vegetables but it tasted good. I figured if I nuked the bread at home a bit it would soften it and it sort've did, but still very chewy. 

To drink we got the honey chysantheum ice tea and it was still hot, with not enough nice in it....Funny, most of the complaints is there is too much ice. Too bad it wasn't good, it was nasty. It had a unpleasant back taste that was a bit like moth ball moldy grandma sweaters.  

I see they have fro-yo and maybe late night fro-yo runs is ok, but I'm real leery now."}
{"text":"OPEN 24 HOURS!!  YAAAASSSSS!!  my all-time go to when I want to get my grub on! Spring rolls are to-die-for best spring rolls I've ever had in my life! I can eat them for the rest of my life everyday every day every day! Seriously so fresh and fat as heck! Don't even get me started on the sauce that comes with it! The liver pate is so good I almost faint when I eat it on my sandwich! The combination sandwich is seriously the go to if you've never been there and you just want to try one of their amazing sandwiches! I prefer not to have too many jalapenos on it because it gets a little spicy but hey to each his own. Hands down best sandwich shop in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hey! I gotta go to them all! 
Consistent and just like the four I've gone to many times in California! The only thing I wish they'd have is roast pork sandwiches like they used to where it began in San Jose California 
The barbecue pork is the staple and I now like the mixed veggie sandwich as well.....commercializing! I saw Starbucks Frapachino in the beverage case! Come on Vietnamese coffee doesn't need that competition!"}
{"text":"Consistant again! I'm trying to go to all of them just like I did crazy shirts in Hawaii! I only need to get to the Oklahoma and one more to round trip the man,Mr. Lee,who I met in 1993. The three packaged shrimp rice wrap spring rolls do it most for me!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the drinks are good. However, this is 2018 and everyone's on their phones. This place literally has the weakest phone service ever. They have free WiFi but when I connected to it, it was like using a toaster for my computer. Y'all need to up the WiFi game because it's boring to eat and talk with people."}
{"text":"I know what real banh mi is supposed to be like. This place is a joke in that regard. 

The sandwiches consist of a lot of bread, and not a lot of meat. If they evened out the ratio a bit more, it may be more palatable. The biggest knock on their sandwiches is that they aren't real banh mi. Think Panda Express in regards to real Chinese food. Lee's is an Americanized establishment that caters to a clientele, in AZ, that doesn't have much in terms of authentic Vietnmese food options. 

The egg rolls they sell here have usually been sitting out for a couple of hours, I'm pretty sure that they are not in compliance with the food safety code in that regard. If you go in the morning though, you should be safe. I've purchased egg rolls at 3:00pm from here and had that rock hard on the outside and super dry on the inside experience. Whenever that happens, you know that they've been sitting out for a while.

If you're in AZ, you're stuck going to this place because there's nothing around here that's a better option for \"banh mi style\" sandwiches. Those not from around here will recognize immediately that what they are selling is not banh mi. 

Go in with adjusted expectations and you will enjoy it more."}
{"text":"I got the grilled beef sandwich and the avocado smoothie. Things lacked flavor, but for the price that everything is--not bad. Or maybe I was just too hungry!

If you're low on money and crave sandwiches, then go for it."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The \"manager\" that I was supposedly on the phone with to make orders placed me on hold for too long. I had to call back and ordered. If I didn't have to order here for work, I wouldn't. Not good for big parties. What a waste of time!"}
{"text":"First of all, this Lee's Sandwiches here in Vegas is no where near any comparison to the one in the Bay Area. This place was all hype and no deliver! 

The first star is for being \"always\" open, late night cravings and or ready to eat food is a good thing about this place and Free Wi-Fi! 
The second star is for a decent special combination Bahn Mi sandwich, it's not close to the one I've had in the Bay but it's enough to satisfy the hunger. Also, the star is for the exceptional Vietnamese spring roll that they make fresh and their Bobas that comes in a variety of flavor.

The other food that they offer are all ok, the chicken wings were kind of salty and their fried spring rolls (lumpia) was just dry. The bread that they use are made fresh, however by the time you get it and take a bite, it's a little dry already. The place offer other tasty food as well like their breakfast sandwiches and other pastries, but all can't be compared to how good i remembered Lee's back in the Bay.

As far as the workers, they are not your typical asian servers, because most of them are either hispanics, blacks and some whites.I've been to this location more than five times already and some of the workers are just rude and loud. However, there were some exceptional servers that were very friendly and attentive to your orders. 

Overall, this place is a miss! I thought after anticipating it's grand opening that it'll be a hit, no it's more of a disappointment. I only go back to this place cuz Mr. Sandwich down the street close early and they really do have good drinks (iced coffee, bobas, smoothies).

Oh yea, as a plus their music playlist is up to date! They got your new hip hop, pop, r&b favorties in the mix lol. Be aware that the commercial they play for the iced coffee can be a little annoying!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I asked fora  recommendation. He recommended the pork asian sandwich...... OOOOH MY GOODNESS! The flavors just dance in your mouth. I paired that with a lychee smoothie. It was perfect."}
{"text":"Horrible and slow service. 30 mins wait for 7 sandwiches when it's not even crowded?? 845 am. Omg. Spoke with store manager Tiffany at the time. She was also present to witness this and apologize"}
{"text":"This little sandwich shop is located in the heart of Chinatown. The plaza it's located is pretty busy so parking can be a hassle, so be aware. 

This restaurant is deceivingly large and a for good reason (it gets pretty busy). They carry a plethora of Asian drinks and the American standards. There's open windows to see the fresh baked breads being kneaded by large machines. I didn't get a chance to ask, but just left of the register they were making some type of small baked good from scratch, which is a plus. 

The ordering process is simple for the most part, but because it gets pretty busy and the area around the counter is congested, you can loose your place in line if you don't pay attention. 

I ordered the roast beef. Quality beef slices, lettuce tomato and mayo on a tasty croissant. The amount of beef given was fair but did leave me hungry for more, so if you go in with an appetite I would double be meat. 

All in all it was a good deli experience and when in the area, I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"BASED ON BREAKFAST ONLY:
Not impressed. Should have known better based on the reviews on here but I was desperate and hungry on my way to work this morning. I got the bacon, ham, egg and cheese on a baguette and a raisin croissant. The sandwich took a few minutes and I was so ready to tear into it when they handed it to me. I was on my way to work so I took it to my car to eat on my drive. Unfortunately I quickly found out that my sandwich was cold. Not warm, cold. I can't remember ever, EVER, getting a breakfast sandwich cold. It didn't even feel like it had ever really been hot. The ham for sure had not been heated up at all. It was fresh out the cooler. Oddly, the sandwich was still decent tasting (maybe I was just that hungry). The baguette was good and had a nice crunch to it. If this sandwich was served hot as it should be this might be a completely different review.
Note to self: stick to McDonalds breakfast.
Oh and $10 minimum on Credit Card for a restaurant/food chain is absurd."}
{"text":"Great place for yummy crunchy doughy rolls with basic deli fixings or exotic combos like spicy chicken, cilantro and vegies.  The iced coffee is really really good too. Spring rolls taste wonderful too. And did I mention that the prices are the best in town for a deli sandwich? 

Note: do not go here thinking \"gourmet italian deli\" - this is more of a standard sub on a better roll at a better price."}
{"text":"Sandwich here are tasty. But the best part is the bakery and varieties of buns. Clean and fast and open 24/7."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 18/100***

My usual is the grilled pork banh mi, perfect balance of sweet and salty with pickled vegetables and jalapenos for a little kick, it's simple yet very flavorful and of course you can't forget the Vietnamese coffee FTW! Chicken egg roll is good as well. Croissants are ok but on the denser side. Not a big fan of their smoothies though, waaaay too sweet! Service is always friendly which is a plus."}
{"text":"Yelp rocks because it leads me to places like Lee's!

I bookmarked this place awhile ago to try after reading Sara B's review.  It's not far from my office, $2.85 sandwiches, Vietnamese, I'm not seeing any downside here yet.

I shared two sandwiches, BBQ pork and fried pork.  The fried was not thrilling but the BBQ was quite tasty.  The fresh onions, jalapeno and cilantro really make these babies pop!

I'll be back soon to begin working my way through the other sandwiches.

It was fortunate that I was also able to help out a couple \"kids\" behind the counter as they were trying to figure out if \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" from \"50 First Dates\" was by the Beatles.  Sad.  Not that I'm a huge Beatles fan or Beach Boys fan but that's just sad."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich through yelp eat24 to save time. When I got to the restaurant they didn't see my order. It took a while for them to sort it out. I had to wait for my order just like anybody else."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

What as once a decently average banh mi is slowly getting worse.  Prices have been inching up over the past few years, and what used to be thick slices of bbq pork or chunks of grilled pork have given way to really think slivers of bbq pork and fattier grilled pork.  

Not to say the sandwiches still aren't tasty, and they're an OK value, they're just not as good as they used to be.

I always appreciate the chicken wings (nice and crispy and a little spicy) and the fresh Deli Manjoo when they have it.  These couple things bring the rating up to an average 3 where I hope it stays for a while."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!

I was starving when I came here, so I ordered a smoothie plus boba, and a Turkey Club on a croissant with avocado and extra veggies, then tipped the cashier.  I love sandwiches and boba, so I waited with high anticipation for a fresh, delicious sandwich on par with the quality Lee's popularity suggests.  Imagine my dismay when I instead got a stale, old, tough croissant with pre-squished avocado, a minimal amount of meat and veggies, and WAYYYYYY too much mayonnaise!
Don't bother with the boba either, it's really hard and not fresh.  The smoothies don't taste like real fresh fruit either, even though they say they are. Funny, I didn't know jackfruit could be shipped to Nevada without being frozen. -_-;;  The smoothie I got didn't even taste like frozen jackfruit... it tasted like a premade flavoring added to a mix.

I should also mention that the cashier was fairly rude while I was ordering, like I was an inconvenience to her in showing up and politely expecting her to do her job for a minute and a half. 

I was so hungry when I came here that I would have accepted even Subway as passible food.  For me to feel this badly about what they offered is a pretty abysmal first experience.  Due to such a stark lack of redeemable qualities I won't be returning... not even at 2 in the morning, not even if every other place is closed... I'd rather go to a fast food joint, eat a Cliff bar, or starve."}
{"text":"I got the Special Combination Sandwich, steamed pork bun, and avocado smoothie. The sand which was ok... I was craving it, so it satisfied me, not necessary hit the spot. The bread was a little on the hard side so it hurt to eat, other than that the filling was good. The steamed pork bun was great, was fresh and they did keep it in a warmer. The avocado smoothie I was disappointed in.. I could've gone to a boba place across the street, but I was already there. You could tell they used artificial powder because it wasn't buttery tasting and the tapioca was like eating pebbles.. definitely not fresh. I'm not saying this because, I've worked at a boba shop so I know what to expect. I'll only go here for sandwiches and hot foods."}
{"text":"On the go, fast service food. Forget your basic hamburger from some fast food joint when you have to grab food on the go. 

This is the only one in vegas that hasn't messed up my order. The coffee is great and strong, good for those long road trips. They now have some other beverage choices that include boba milk coffee. There's other choices if you don't like bun mi, like croissant sandwhichs and mini subs. These dessert pastries that include pandan waffles and dust and filled pastries. 

If you like Asian food you should give this franchise a try!"}
{"text":"This week, I was blessed with a work schedule that let me out at 5pm instead of 12am every night. I was craving some banh-mi and decided to stop at Lee's. As usual, I order my house special sandwich with a side of fish sauce and happy eat away.

The next day I thought I would go to one of my favorite Viet sandwich places and I was reminded of what a GOOD banh-mi is supposed to taste like. Delectable meats, crisp vegetables, mild but spicy jalapeno, and most importantly--soft, gourmet bread with a bite. I soon realized that Lee's is simply OK. The bread is hard, the service sucks, and the sandwich just isn't as flavorful as some of the other places in town.

The next day I tried another banh-mi place in Chinatown and was again reminded of how much better it was than Lee's. 

Two thumbs up for CONVENIENCE (24/7) But thumbs down to actually good food. -____-\"

Go to your other banh-mi joints if you can. But if you need a banh-mi fix at 2AM. Mister Lee is there for you."}
{"text":"Their coffee is amazing! Adding boba brings it to the next level  open 24/7   I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"Always fresh food: we had the turkey on baguettes - as well as egg rolls and chicken wings.  They offer an interesting variety of Asian snacks, iced coffees, and ice cream on the menu.

Staff is always friendly and accommodating as well.  Great place to stop for a quick, inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"The first time I ventured here I was skeptical. I don't like bahn mi, so keep that in mind with the four stars. The foundation of a really good sandwich is the bread. If you have shitty bread, it doesn't matter what you throw on it, you're gonna have a bad sandwich. The bread here is good, really good. A nice crusty on the outside, soft on the inside bread. The toppings could be higher quality. I feel like I could probably make an equivalent sandwich if I had their bread, but I'm in chinatown ordering a salami sandwich. I really like grabbing some egg rolls or an Italian soda with my lunch. If you're on the fence about this place, stop by and grab a loaf or nine of bread. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE Lee's Sandwiches! My first visit I was really skeptical, but my boyfriend insisted we'd give it a try. Thank goodness he dragged me in! Their sandwiches are fresh & their bread is amazingly soft. I appreciate the presentation they have for their sandwiches. Make sure you also grab an iced americano latte! It's officially my favorite iced coffee. It's always a treat to stop by Lee's!"}
{"text":"Tried their \"Lee's Cafe\" -- which is Vietnamese style coffee w/ condensed milk & ice. It was good, better than all the other things I've had here, but I could still get that some where else. 

Good thing about this place is that it's open on holidays and 24 hours. 

This still doesn't make the cut for \"go to places.\""}
{"text":"Sandwiches are addicting !  Really good. 
I will eventually try them all. 
And a BÁNH BAO ..."}
{"text":"The smoothies are to die for, but the food and service is just okay. The service was very slow, and the employees were not the nicest, but the smoothies keep me coming back! If anything, the prices are good!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!  But we easily feed a family of 4 hungry people for less than $20 and it's not Taco Bell.  So with that being said... the Grilled Pork #5 sandwich... oh hell ya... it's good ringing in at only $2.85.  The regular Turkey / Ham on a crossaint is about $4.25 and it's the size of a small football... great value... you could probalby get by with the small croissant sandwich instead for  only $1.95... yeah... it's crazy cheap.  Hot wings are generic prebreaded with a kick of spiciness.   The steamed bun is sweet dough..however, not my favorite... my husband and sister seem to love the egg and meat inside.  The ice cream is all homemade...also another great deal at $.99 cents for a cone... check out the icecream...looks crazy good.  Don't miss out on taking home some baked goods... the baguettes are crusty-soft and warm when you get them.  The croissants are delicious and some of the better ones here in the valley.  I did try and Avacodo boba...had to send it back...not sure what the heck it was...it was green... but didn't taste anything like Avacado... so I did head across the way to Boba tea house for my bobas.  The Viet coffee, also great kick for you mentally if you need a boost, very strong=very good.  Don't miss out on this place... it's a good go to place for a great lunch or snack."}
{"text":"In love with their sandwiches, they need to make more locations in Phoenix! These subs are so cheap. You can get a 12 inch Vietnamese sub for like $4. CASH ONLY. This is how they keep their prices so low."}
{"text":"I've always getting Lee's ice coffee everytime after finished eating with some pho in chinatown vegas. This Lee's sandwiches place is twices more bigger and must more cleaner than those from San gabriel valley. They are open for 24/7 here at vegas."}
{"text":"This is my to go place for Banh mi when there is no  mama and papa store offering Banh mi . 
They're my Banh mi institution always offering the same fresh and quality product. Love their hours they're always open early enough that you can buy their food for a picnic and late enough for that late flight supper.
My favorite is their special combo sandwich ; always good and fresh. 
Their egg rolls are little morsels, 2 bites of goodness. It is a packed with fillings . We got a fresh batch ( came later at night) and it came out piping , crispy goodness. 
They also offer several Che ( viet desert) and other goodies. 
Check them out! You'll come out liking one of their many varieties of Banh mi."}
{"text":"Great basic subs and good iced coffee. I am a little afraid to try some of the sandwiches but the regular subs are always great and the bread is crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. Just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Hubby & I just recently gave them another try & it was great! I got my usual grilled pork banh mi with extra cilantro, add pate. It tasted great & best of all, I felt great after eating it! So happy that whatever was causing my stomach issues seems to not be a problem anymore & I hope it stays that way!"}
{"text":"I don't know how recent they updated their business hours, but I was very disappointed to come here for breakfast because it said it opened at 7:30. Only to find out they open at 8am. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it was very inconvenient when I had to get to work at 8. So, I think this needs to be updated. 

They open at 8AM. Not 7:30AM."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 star, but I will round up, since it is a 24hr spot.

This is a little bit of everything in Chinatown.  Not only do they prepare decent sandwiches, but they have plenty of other items on the menu including frozen yogurt, fresh baked goods, and boba drinks.

The food is not mind blowing, but it is pretty decent for the money, and the portions are fair.  Everything I have had tastes fresh, and haven't really had any issues here.

Overall, it is a solid place to eat late at night, but you won't really see me here before midnight, since there are much more places I would rather eat.

So overall, a 3 star review if you are dining here before midnight...a 3.5-4 star if it is super late and you want something fast and cheap."}
{"text":"When I saw that Lee's Sandwiches was opening, I was very excited for something new to try! Sadly, it didn't quite live up to what I expected. The service was slow, and the tables were dirty. 

BUT, I did get an avocado boba smoothie and it was delicious. I don't think I'd go back just for the smoothie, but if you do intend to drop by there definitely try their boba. 

Also, they had signs displaying macaroons outside of the store, on the window, and by the cash register by when I ordered them they acted as if they have never had macaroons.... how weird."}
{"text":"This lee sandwich location is really nice and convenient from my house than he spring mountain one. The sandwich is great, although dry bread and kinda flavorless sometimes but for the price, it's worth it. There is a but 5, get 1 free deal so that's one of the reasons I went. HOWEVER, lee sandwich is known for their coffee and it's great, get the one in the to go bottle or order one yourself, it's great either way, heads up, it's really strong and would keep you up all day, so get it in the morning I would say. HOWEVER, the other drinks honestly suck. For example, I got the Thai tea with boba and it wasn't great in my opinion. The Thai tea was sour and bitter, like coffee, and the boba was hard to chew and they don't put that much on it."}
{"text":"I like their sandwiches. I get the pork roll/loaf (#2). I can't decide what to think about the meat portions. You only get two slivers of pork- unless you ask for more. I am not sure if I would want more. I get so much enjoyment out of the crunch and pickled-ness of the veggies, that I wonder if more meat would take away from that enjoyment. I know when I make banh mi gio at home, I load it with gio and get grossed out by the time I get to the half mark (the dogs love that though)! My bf gets the combo sandwiches and those are pretty tasty with plenty of meat."}
{"text":"Hi fellow foodies!

Lees is a great find but be warned..... CASH ONLY!! 

Although they do have an ATM machine inside with cheap fees it doesn't always work.

As you wait in line to order there are shelves of Asian foods on each side of you.

So many interesting things to look at keeps you entertained while waiting

Since they seem to always be baking it smells heavenly from the wonderful breads to the soft flaky delicious crossaints and beyond!

It is a must to try one different pastry each time to experience the culture!

I cannot go on enough about their pastries!! AMAZING!!

The sandwiches are a culinary experience that's takes you on a mouth watering tour.

I like the combo on baguette ... Thereis not a ton of meats but enough to satisfy and you can always order double meat for cheap

The sandwiches are less than $5.00 and are on a soft crusty delicious fresh baguette or you can opt to have it in a crossaint so ordering double meat for those who are super hungry still makes it a very reasonably priced meal!

Also tons of drinks to choose from be it Thai tea to coffees to cold drinks and  they have fresh sugar cane drink which as you can imagine is sweeter than I can handle... But was fun to try.

There is ample seating and the place is always clean!

They decorate for holidays and when you walk in the door you feel the welcome!

I am a harsh critic but I gotta say.... LEES IS A MUST TRY RESTAURANT...  And as we all know from my reviews.....It must be something special for me to rave....

Something for everyone!

So in closing..... Remember to take time to stop and smell the roses... Life is too short!

Bon appetite'"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone downhill.  It was Tuesday 8/1/17 at 9 pm.  The front smelled like someone had changed their diaper.  The cashier goes about his business and doesn't say that he will eventually be with me, just goes about his business.  I ask how much something is and before I could get another word in, he just walks away to help another fellow behind me pay cash for some bread. I have a WTF moment as he let that guy behind me just walk in front of me to order and it wasn't even a quick order.  He just looks at me and doesn't say a word.  All I wanted was to buy frozen coffee.  My order would not have taken that long, and it would have been done rather quickly.  I don't know what I did to deserve this type of treatment. I've been coming here for years. So after waiting to be helped, and then left waiting again, I just left.  That sucked."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go to! I love their Vietnamese iced coffee, their chicken banh mi is also one of my favorites. They take out fresh warm bread every thirty minutes. The employees are very nice, they even let you know how much longer it will be in order for you to get the fresh warm bread if you'd like!"}
{"text":"This Lee's is probably bigger than most others. Lee's is a chain so it tastes and costs the same but it's just as good. I usually order the BBQ Pork Banh Mi to go as my friends and I usually stop by here before leaving Vegas on Sunday morning. 

If you like Viet food and sandwiches definitely check this place out. (also serves Boba)"}
{"text":"i think we all know about the reputation of Lees Sandwiches. Although i prefer the bahn mi from Dakao the smoothies here make me just kill two birds with one stone. the smoothies here are good. so the combination and varieties here are good i want to try thye regular sandwiches and it seems you dont have to get the sandwich on the french bread they offer crossiants here too.."}
{"text":"With baby sleeping and husband in the car, and a long commute back to San Diego, we came here with the expectations of fast Vietnamese Lee's sandwiches for the road. We were beyond disappointed. Utter waste of time. Let me explain. 

At 11am on a Monday 10/21/13. I was the only customer in this store. Ordered 6 sandwiches and 2 drinks. After I placed my order, they said it will take 10 minutes. No explanation why it would take so long despite me being the only customer. But fine. Sat there and waited, and waited and waited. 

As I waited I saw the three workers roaming around the employee area/kitchen. They didn't look busy making my sandwiches, nor did I get my 2 drinks yet (Vietnamese coffee and Thai iced tea with boba) so I went up to ask them what was going on after I had waited 20 minutes. It wasn't until then that they said it would take a couple more minutes. I reminded them of my drinks which they seemed to have forgotten so they rushed to make it. I asked them why it had taken so long and they mentioned that they didn't have bread. What? A French baguette place with no bread??? They could have told me that BEFORE I ordered. As I complained to the two workers about my dissatisfaction of 1) why this order is taking too long. 2) why they failed to inform me that it was going to take this long and why and 3) why they didn't get my drinks ready and why they did not give me a boba straw for my boba drink. 

I asked to speak to the manager--who I saw standing an earshot away, this thin female Vietnamese girl with her hair tied back nonchalantly failed to acknowledge any customer dissatisfaction. The guy #1 at the register pointed to her as the manager so I raised my voice to call her out so I can speak to her. Nothing. Pure ignorance. I asked again \"manager, can I speak to you?\" Nothing. She was just shuffling around looking \"occupied\" as I was still the only customer in the store. Then I asked guy #1 to ask her to come out so I can speak to her. She continued to pretend as she didn't hear until I asked him to bring her out. Finally she came out, I asked her if she was the manager and she points to guy #1 and says \"he's the manager too\". I voiced my dissatisfaction and they did not seem to care. Told them I would write a negative yelp review (as I am doing now). But they did not care. Told them I will contact corporate, but they did not care. 

Obviously this place did not care about communication and customer service. To top that off, the long awaited sandwiches weren't even that great. 40 minutes later I was out the door and was obviously dissatisfied. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Fast readable prides sandwich.  Opens 24 hours.  Service was fast and efficient.  We had Asian Sandwich Combo $5.99 and Huge Chocolate Chip Cookie."}
{"text":"Long time at pickup for just a smoothies, have to wait b4 all lunch orders in front of me are done, it just a drink, and i don't think it should take long to get it????"}
{"text":"I have seen the banh mi light, and am still just kind sorta a convert to the zealotry. It's a damn fine sandwich. I will give you that much. the atmosphere has all the personality of a hospital cafeteria, but the price was a screaming deal. 

I really don't care for the cash only policy, but I understand it helps keep those prices at a rock bottom level. Personal pet peeve.

The baguette they use is chewy and toothsome, but there was way too much of a bread-to-filling ratio for my tastes. All the meaty bits they toss in there are also pretty fantastic. If you think you don't like head cheese or liver pate, try the number one and get back to me. It's got both in spades and manages to stay delicious. The cilantro and veggies they toss on the sammich also balance it all into a harmonious French-Vietnamese delight.

Too bad it's in Chandler. The valley seriously needs more banh mi and less pho."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches are always a treat!  They are tasty and cheap... They did recently raise the prices, but its till under $4 for a Vietnamese sandwich.  They have a good variety of sides and Euro sandwiches.  They also sell baguettes for a good price.  But remember, its cash only!"}
{"text":"Yes, my review relationship with Lee's could be described as fickle, even crazy. I had just come to peace with Lee's because they started accepting credit cards, and I enjoy their iced green tea. However, they have raised their credit card minimum to $15, and we made the chilling discovery that if you order \"light ice\" they pour the exact same amount of beverage. This means that you receive a glass that is 3/4 full. This is in the top 10 most ridiculous business practice I have witnessed, up there with charging a quarter for tap water...crap, I probably just gave Lee's another idea."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! They have delicious sandwiches for good prices. I wish they were open later in the evening though. I don't get off work until 9 on weekdays and 8 on weekends. I'd love to be able to stop by and grab something on my way home.

I usually get number 11 which, to my understanding, is similar to the combination (number 1) but more. Like a combination plus, haha. I sometimes get the pork and shrimp egg rolls as well. I don't think they will be everyone's cup of tea, but I like them. 

Overall, it's a great place for an inexpensive meal. Definitely stop by in you are in the area. :)"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches caught me a little bit off guard. I wanted to go there so bad and had a bit of a vision of what it might look like, and boy was I wrong. Vietnamese restaurants are always dirty, run down, and seemingly ill-maintained. Lee's couldn't be any different, it's clean, shiny, and efficient. Ordering takes place at the counter, and they have about 20+ sandwiches you can choose from, both american and vietnamese. Vietnamese are under $3 and american are over $4 and not nearly as delicious. 

I wasn't courageous enough to try the signature Lee's Combonation, because it has Head Cheese (it's not cheese) and I'm kind of a pussy when it comes to that stuff. I had decided before I went that I would have the Grilled Pork, they were out, so as a back up I ordered the BBQ pork, which they were out of. I settled for Shredded Pork, and it was fairly good.

I'm going to go back and order something that fits my tastes, but as of now based on my experience there, it's only 3 stars. The shredded pork sandwich wasn't tremendous, and they were out of too many things. Shouldn't happen. For price and cleanliness though, this place is great."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch sometimes. I usually get either the ham and cheese on a criossant or the grilled chicken Banh Mi. I dig the prices but you must remember to bring cash. They also have a decent mango smoothie and bubble tea drinks, but I usually trust the place across the street for that."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and smoothies! They have other awesome Vietnamese foods to try definitely recommend to try this place"}
{"text":"Lee's is a prime spot to get your banh mi and boba fix! Each time I come in I usually order a BBQ pork sandwich and Honey Dew boba. Portioning is good, usually I have half of the sandwich leftover because the first half and the boba itself gets me pretty full. 

This location is 24/7 but in weekends, especially at night when you want to get your late night munchies on sometimes you'll have a hard time finding parking in the area. There's a back lot area where you could park as well but you'd have to walk all the way around the entire complex building to the front to enter the store. Sometimes Lee's have the buy 2 boba get 1 free or buy 3 boba and get 2 free deal. I never know when it happens because it's random and they do not announce it as much, you'd just find out upon entering their store.

***Minimum on a card is $10.*** Late at night (from my experience) they may not have change for $50 bills and $100 bills, keep your cash low. They have Asian snacks and drinks stored around the store as well but it appears to be a bit more expensive than a regular Asian market that has it."}
{"text":"We picked up our morning coffee from Lee's Sandwich at Las Vegas Chinatown.

Wow! That was the biggest Lee's Sandwiches place I'd ever seen. 

Ca phe sua da ($3.95): it was a perfect cup of ca phe sua da. 

The coffee was good and the service was fast. 

QUICK TIP: IT IS LOCATED AT THE CENTER AT SPRING MOUNTAIN, NOT CHINATOWN PLAZA. 

4 stars!!

Lee's Sandwiches is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"I've hand better Vietnamese sandwiches, but if you want something quick from a fairly clean place, Lee's the way to go.  Too bad they don't have other options in dishes like the larger Lee's.  The Vermicelli noodles with 3-4 choices of meat is pretty good."}
{"text":"Smaller size location and more expensive prices compared to other Lee's sandwiches. Sandwiches are $3.69 in Chandler, but they go for over $4 bucks at this location. Since the store is smaller they also offer less items to buy. The worst part is that they don't have sugar cane here. Duuu maa! The pork meatball (xiu mai) banh mi here is terrible. It uses the same meat you find in pate chaud instead of being marinated in a rich tomato sauce at every other banh mi shops .... Lazy! Lastly the ice coffee is 90% ice and 9% water and 1% coffee. Greeeeaaaat. 

PS: get a sugar cane machine!"}
{"text":"Love love love their sandwiches! Not all authentic but close enough. We had eggs and vietnamese meat loaf, really good. And the grill pork are good as well. Their coffee is strong! They're good!"}
{"text":"We wandered in here after lunch while checking out Chinatown. Nice clean spacious low key place, looks like a diner inside with food court ordering style. We had their mini custard cakes, cafe sua da, pate chau,  and large croissants. Would try out their sandwiches next time. Good flavours in the ice coffee."}
{"text":"No avocado for two days?? What a joke! 

The Spring Mountain location is superior to this one. But unfortunately it is far away. 

Love their Vietnamese Coffee. At least they had that today."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that I loveee Bahn Mi's... especially the one next to tea planet (corner store) and the small shack in front of tea planet... those are delish... 

Having said that, I was really excited to try this place out, after reading the reviews on Yelp, I was a but skeptical so I gave this place a try. I stopped by this morning at 9:30am, place was very clean so I give that an A. I ordered the following and my opinion.... OH YEA all these orders weren't for me, I bought a variety of stuff for me and my friends and all took bites ;)

#6- bbq pork... horrible, it was thin slivers of the red chinese bbq COLD 
#11- special combo... the meats had so many artifical red coloring
#82- ham, bacon, egg, cheese... nothing special, tasted like the fast food breakfast sandwiches
#14- pork roll w/pate.... wheres the pate?? oh wait its smeared onto only half the roll!!!!

Deli Majo- look like little tiny madelines filled with sweet custard
Hollow donut- covered with sesame seeds and fried
Sesame Ball- tiny sesame balls filled with red bean paste, fried

Overall, I thought the baguettes would be light & crispy, but it was rock hard and too cold. There also was not enough of the dikon/carrot stuff... and too much cilantro!!! The pastries were ok....

This place looked like a really cool place, but you can tell its definitely a huge company that runs this establishment.... Next time you want a real Bahn Mi, try the small mom and pop stores... although you may have trouble with communication, you wont be disappointed with the food!!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love their croissants!  They are so fresh and delicious.  I've never actually tried their baguettes because I love their croissants too much to stray away from them.  The sandwiches are large and very inexpensive.  They have a great drink menu as well.   My only complaint is that they only take cash.  :("}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the staff here. They seem to be very hard working. The food just wasn't good. It was edible, but not good."}
{"text":"I got combo 11 (dac biet) sandwich and a Thai ice tea. The bun is really hard to chew through but still petty descent . The sandwich place at mekong is way better. Been here many times and the wings and eggs rolls is very good a must try. The service is just Ok nothing special about it."}
{"text":"I went here a couple of times but lucky, I was able to go with a couple of friends who didn't even know what a Bahn Mi is. I told my friend who would have the most trouble adjusting to Vietnamese food to order a grilled pork sandwich, their most popular item. However, I am a fan of authenticity and I ordered their \"combination\" sandwich. This sandwich consists of Vietnamese deli meats such as (http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/Banh-Mi-Sandwich-Ingredients) Cha Lua, a cooked pork roll lightly seasoned with fish sauce, and traditionally steamed or boiled in a banana leaf. Thit Nguoi is a Vietnamese salami containing cured pork layered with fat and headcheese.

Whenever I order these ingredients... I always regret not getting the grilled pork. It's not like these plastic-like deli meats are flavorful, but grilled meat is just so much more satisfying. You have a delicious warmth when you bite into it, and the succulent juices of grilled meat just doesn't match the deli meat bite.

Either way, my friend enjoyed her sandwich. 
The unique thing about Bahn Mi is the flavorful combinations through each bite. It satisfies literally every type of taste and texture you can think about. The baguette is extremely crunchy and complements the creaminess of the mayonnaise, the sweet and sour pickled vegetables bring a pucker of flavor and the cilantro gives freshness. Of course, the meat is the savory (umami for nerds) and juicy component.

For dessert, we decided to eat macarons. These colorful little cookies can pretty much impress everyone. My friend who tried them said that she had better at the Scottsdale Fashion Center, but I think those are a gold standard. Either way, when you bite into the macarons, you get a crispy outside and a semi-gooey inside which is what I like to find in my macarons. 
The green tea macarons don't taste like green tea. They have a hint of lemon.

Ambiance
Lee's Sandwiches remind me of a standard San Jose Vietnamese market shop except pristine and very clean. My friends and I were treated with a beautiful decorated Lunar New Year tree walking in. Like most Vietnamese places of this type, Vietnamese products are displayed on wired racks all the way throughout the register. 

Service
There is technically no service in the restaurant. You go up and order it pretty much like fast food. 

Cost
$4.00 or so for a 10 inch sandwich at most. Well worth the price and you can argue can give Subway a run for their money.

Selection
For the sandwiches, you have two menus, the Vietnamese sandwiches and the American sandwiches with about 10 options each. Of course, you're here for some legitimate banh mi so your options are: weird Vietnamese meats, grilled meats, or vegetarian. 

Overall
If you want a quick bite to eat and you want to experience a Vietnamese subway, just go to lee's Sandwiches and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the combination sandwiches here! Anthony was really helpful. My mom is a big fan of the thai iced tea. We make sure to stop by whenever we're in chinatown."}
{"text":"Lee's sandwiches never disappoints! This is my go to spot when I want really good banh mi sandwiches. I usually get #11 which is the special combination. The baguette really makes this sandwich bangin. The baguette's are bakes fresh every 30 mins. Nice and soft on the inside, the perfect crunch on the outside! I can't come here without leaving with just a fresh baguette alone. 

Their boba smoothies are on point too. Perfect sweetness. Flavors are on point. Tapioca balls are nice and soft.

When I want to save the sandwiches for later, I usually ask them for the veggies on the side!

The only thing I don't like about this location is that they accept cash only. Also when making the Vietnamese coffee, they add so much ice. Literally 90% ice, 10% coffee."}
{"text":"For those of you who don't already know, Lee's sandwich is a very popular franchise throughout the west coast that specializes in Vietnamese deli, refreshments and desserts. Look at it like a McDonalds, but a little bit more healthy and among the Asian community. Back in the early years of 2000, Lee's sandwich used to be one of my favorite pit stops every time my family and I would go to California. They USED to have one of the best BBQ pork baguettes in CA and their combination baguettes were to die for. Now, however, given the expansion of this franchise to Vegas, Lees sandwich has gone down in quality so much that the only thing worth going there for is just their coffee and 24 hr convenience.

Whenever I go there to order a sandwich, it always seems like something is missing from the core. Whether it be too little meat, too little veggies, or too little sauce, it never comes out full or consistent. The meat that they use for their special combination is also tasteless, and they never seem to put enough mayo/sauce. Same goes for their BBQ pork. It has no BBQ flavors, plus is too sweet and always dry. I'm Vietnamese and I know how a proper sandwich should be made. Most Vietnamese people will tell you, It needs to have some  dashes of soy sauce in order to wrap up the flavors. However, it seems as if Lee's tried so hard to make their food Americanized for a more diverse crowd, that they made everything bland and flavorless (almost with a \"healthy\" image). On top of that, the workers making it need to be more on the same page.  Not once have I gone there did I get a sandwich that was well stuffed and not mostly bread when I take a bite. Also, the next time you buy their sandwich, try leaving it out for about 30 min before eating it. Guarantee, the baguette will be hard as a rock. Same goes for reheating the sandwiches. The outside should be CRISPY, not hard! It should not be that way!

However, there is one thing good that I would like to give Lee's recognition for (which is also what earned it 1 more star)... Their Vietnamese ice coffee is to die for. The roast they use is very rich and deep in flavors. It is not as strong as Vietnamese coffee straight from the filters you get when you order it in pho restaurants, but the richness is definitely there. On top of that, their coffees have the perfect combination of cream at the same time. 

Overall, if you're not hungry, then I would definitely suggest getting their coffee (for the same price as a baguette), instead of anything else. You can definitely give it a try, but know that Lee's sandwich failed at making Vietnamese Banh Mi."}
{"text":"Was visiting Vegas and noticed a familiar place. Decided to stop by and get a quick bite. I've always like lee's sandwich so it was no surprise that I ended up liking this place too. I got the combination sandwich and a honey dew smoothie. Both were great. Service was okay. Kinda felt like he was a bit rude but the food was excellent so I'm only gonna deduct a star for that. Still a good place and it's open 24/7 so try it out as a nice late night snack"}
{"text":"#1 rule: bring cash.

I love this place. I usually get the #12 Vegetarian sandwich and a Lee's Coffee. Grab a fresh baguette to go or a day-old one to make bread pudding or French toast later. The fresh bread is amazing -- you could just by a baguette and some butter and go to town.

All of the pastries I've had there have likewise been excellent. The little cream-filled cakes (deli manjoo?) are pretty tasty, although I've OD'd on those before and have to take it easy. Don't order the box of 20 and try to eat it all at once!

I love the veggies (including sliced fresh jalapenos) on the \"Asian sandwiches\" and I don't know if I've ever had any other type here. Beware the #8 Shredded Pork, a.k.a 'pork skin' sandwich... if you've never had one before, it probably isn't what you expect. The cashiers generally realize your level of \"non-Asian-ness\" and ask if you're REALLY sure when you try to order it. Don't be offended, they're just making sure you get something that you want to eat. :) 

It may be a cash-only establishment, but the prices are very reasonable, the menu is extensive, and service is normally fast."}
{"text":"I've eaten a few times. The food is always good and fresh. The staff is super. They don't hurry you and are will help explain the different items. The place is clean and parking is in and out."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend back in January.  The person who took our order was polite, and the sub I had (the only vegetarian one on the menu, I think) was pretty good.  The smoothie I had, though, was more ice cream and sugar than fruit, like it seemed to be advertised.  There's no table service here, which is perfectly normal for a sub place, but I've had better subs elsewhere, and way better smoothies elsewhere, as well.  If I come back, I'll have the sub and skip the smoothie."}
{"text":"The place is very nice and big, but the sandwiches weren't that good. The French bread was light in color, almost like it was undercooked, and it was doughy. Unlike the other bhan mi place where the bread is crunchy and the ingredients are tasty, this one lacks tastes too, the place I give 5 stars, but food gets only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent bread/baguettes and quality sandwich fare... Lee's is one the few places in Vegas that can serve me a simple sandwich for a fair price (less than $8) on a level that is even somewhat reminiscent of what I can get in NY."}
{"text":"Feels like the sandwiches here are over price and the one on the east side of town tastes better."}
{"text":"Love the Ham and Cheese Crossant. What a killer of deal. You must try their wings as well. Cant get enough of this place. I go grocery shopping at Lee Lee's just so I can stop buy Lee's Sandwiches. Everything is yummy here."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time but I've decided to stop (on 7/27). If you look through my photos, you will see I found a long piece of plastic saran wrap. 

When I told the sandwich maker (didn't speak much English sadly) told me that somehow it just got in there, or made an excuse that sounded like it was an accident. The way we communicated, there was no way for to me ask if I could get my money back...nor did they offer to do any more because well, it's an Asian establishment and we all know how some Asians are with customer service - there isn't any.

Also, totally agree with Nelson Q's review, the Ice Coffee, the whole thing was filled with crushed up. like to the top of the cup where you have difficulty getting a straw in there.

** head over to Pho Thanh Huong by UNLV - best sandwiches in town. sadly, they close at 10pm I believe."}
{"text":"Does this look full to you?! My BFF and I have been coming here for over 5 years and remember when they started charging for \"less ice\"... because we don't like super watered-down iced coffee. Well who dose?!? So management put up a sign and added a 50¢ fee. Then they raised the prices... I get it. Now, although expensive, we will splurge once in a while, and this is what we get!? The employees won't even explain why a quarter of the drink is missing, and why there's still the regular amount of ice! This is inexcusable and becoming a total waste of money! $6 + tax, and we can't even get a full drink, or an apology?!? Ahhhhhh!!! Upon asking the employee, he simply turned and walked away... in fact, right off to the public restroom while still wearing his cooking apron. Now I'm upset, unruly and ultimately grossed out all at once. We are done. Farewell Lee's Coffee! I used to love you! :( Now 'the people' and their incompetence have killed it for me! #RUDE #NeverAgain #BoycottBadBusiness #LeesSandwiches #LasVegas"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've ever had in my entire life. The staff was so incredibly nice. I ordered a roast beef sandwich on a croissant. The croissant was truly a gift from above, so sweet and buttery. I wish my stomach was bigger so that I can eat more of these amazing sandwiches. If your in the area, eat here."}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches is definitely the place to get your snack on. It's located in a shopping center in the middle of Chinatown, which most of the time, sucks driving in no matter what. 

Lee's is definitely a go-to at any time of the day simply because they have affordable food that's a little above average in quality. I usually come during late night hours after work or class because it's not really busy and it isn't too pricey to break the bank.

The interior is bright. There's neon lights everywhere, colorful displays of food and bottled drinks off to the sides (like the jellies that come in the animal-shaped jars), and upbeat Top 100 type music playing. It literally looks like a scene from iCarly or some other show on Nick LOL. 

Their taro milk tea with boba is actually pretty good. I think at some places the taro boba is a hit or a miss. Lee's pretty much has it (almost) perfect. It's sweet and not watered down. The boba is a little sparing, but it's the perfect consistency -- not too mushy, and not undercooked and hard. Ask for less ice if you don't want your drink to be 85% ice and the rest actual liquid and boba.

I'm a big fan of their BBQ Pork steamed buns. The dough isn't dry when you bite in, and although the meat filling is bundled up in the center of the bun, it's actually really tasty! The filling is very sweet/savory and is one snack that can hold you over for a while (at least for me it does). Most of the time, they have steamed buns available but sometimes they can be completely wiped out of them because they're so good. They have other snacks that are equally as delicious like the chicken wings and the egg rolls. They're super addicting as well!

If you don't want to drive all over Chinatown for decent boba and cheap snack-like food, then Lee's has got your back!"}
{"text":"I love bahn mi, I really do and I have been to the lee's in San fransisco and it was delish but this particular lee's location is just blahhh...


I had the house combination special...
Bread is hard and dry, the pickled veggies are too big and bland with no cucumber in it, wtf...
And the slices of meat were just cut so sloppy

Pâté chaud was seriously lacking of stuffing, it was pretty much all bread

The Thai tea with boba had HUGE icebergs and chunks of ice in it and the boba was not great either, my drink had more ice than actual beverage and it was hard to drink becausevof those huge chunk of ice.

Almond croissants are ok, I had better

The only plus is that its  open 24hours and they sell pâté pre packaged at the refregirated section along with good tapioca desserts which is cool cause I love pâté so i can make my own bahn mi at home instead of eating here again."}
{"text":"I was craving a banh Mi from Lee's and I finally got it...yay!  My favorite is the combination of course, but don't forget the jalapeno to add that extra flavor to it. Lol.  U also have to get the cafe sua da (coffee) because it's so yummy!  I wanted the sugar cane juice but they were out :'(  oh well, I guess I'll try to get it when I return to the mainland, but for now I'm satisfied w my purchase.  However, I wasn't happy w the customer service.  When I went to the store, the cashier never smiled once and didn't have a personality. I think she either didn't like me because I'm Vietnamese or because she lost her money in the slot machine? Hahaha.  Next time I'm in Vegas I think I'll look for another location....Hopefully they smile there. :-)"}
{"text":"How often do you come across a real treasure?  Once every couple of years?  Well, the Chandler AZ treasure of 2007 is Lee's Sandwiches, and I wish them much success.

Why I Give Mad Props to Lee's Sandwiches:
1. They have outdoor seating with mist-ers to keep customers cool, even at 110 degrees.
2. Add a statuesque actor in trademark John Wayne Gasey white makeup & a gondola canal inside, and you'd have the Venetian.  Then again, maybe not, but there is a mini concave rotunda built into the ceiling, painted with the colors of the wind.
3. They have a baguette factory.  Watch stainless steel machinery crank out French style loaves, while you and your chums enjoy an affordable meal in the dining area.
4. Eighteen different flavors of gelato.
5. They have a Deli Manjoo cream cake counter, with colorful carrying cases for to-go orders.
6. Fresh bread, fresh whole cilantro and thinly sliced fresh jalapenos joined forces to awaken sleepy taste buds.
7. The stylish Lance Armstrong style rubber bracelet which was affixed to each sandwich to keep the wrapper on tight.  Okay, it was just a sixteenth of an inch wide and only came in white.  What do you all want for nothing?  A rubber biscuit?
8. The low low prices.
9. My meal provided me with a front row seat to the putrid-pudding-stampede, at no additional cost.

Why I Put Lee's Sandwiches on Blast:
1. They don't take plastic... but they do have a shifty looking ATM against the wall.
2. The sweetly pickled julienned carrot sticks which were strategically placed on my meatball and bbq pork subs.  I didn't find the extra crunch to be an appealing augmentation.
3.  Some of the aromas emitted from behind the counter were not altogether inviting.

Finally, I found the cashier to be very friendly.  When I walked in with only a Hamilton, and the bill came to $10.11, guess who covered my shortage?  That's right, Nicole the benevolent cashier.

{"text":"My dad brought home two banh mi and a loaf of bread from their grand opening. We were disappointed when we opened up the sandwiches to see the minuscule amount of filling.pickled veggies, or herbs. The cost of the last two items is virtually nothing, so that was baffling. I understand that the crunch of the crust and the bite of the bread is important, but does it make it right to skimp on the rest of the ingredients? Growing up in a Vietnamese family near Little Saigon, in California, I expected more from this place.

I normally like the special, which has a little of everything. Banh mi is a delicate balance between the aforementioned bread, a smooth pate, a creamy mayo, a fatty char sui, a Vietnamese sausage or fish cake, cilantro, peppers, pickled diakon and carrots. Too much, or in this case, too little throws off the sub. If you are in the mood for great banh mi, go down the street pass Cathay House. Their is a wonderful shop located next to Ann's Salon called Dakao Sandwiches. They are friendly, bake their own bread, and produce a far superior sandwich."}
{"text":"Best place for Vietnamese sandwiches! They also have good coffee but they put so much ice in it that you only get a little bit of coffee! 

The food is affordable, they only accept cash only.

The croissant sandwiches are pretty good too. The roast beef one is a winner."}
{"text":"Decent Bahn Mi. Fresh spring rolls were not very good. Bread is fresh but they really really skimp on the meat.

Cash only. This place has a line and be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I love lees!!! I like how they stay open 24hrs and my favorite is the vanilla ice coffee and pork roll sandwich no onions lol ... The pastries are pretty good too;) I like this location way better than the new one!"}
{"text":"Since I eat here on a regular basis I felt I should finally give them their due. I always order the #11 combo which is the banh mi sandwich with a drink and 2 egg rolls. It's enough food for two meals easily. My bestie orders the tuna salad sandwich but gets the Asian toppings as she loves the pickled carrots and radishes. I've ordered boba a few times, all were delicious. Today I ordered the strawberry smoothie for a coworker and she loved it. I like to order then head over to the Asian market next door to grab some things while my meal is being prepared. There are about 3 guys usually working and they are are super friendly and accommodating with any request."}
{"text":"Gave this place a second try about 8 months ago,,, First time, the baguette was way Too Dry, like a crouton...

Friend of ours catered a party with some of the croissant ham n swiss sandwiches and they were GREAT, and price was very reasonable.

I have been coming back here about once a Week and even get a sandwich for my next day lunch... Still GREAT .....

Glad they are doing good and hope to seem them for a LONG time coming,,,,

Bring CASH or be prepared to use the in store ATM.."}
{"text":"the banh mi is just ok, i found there wasn't much meat. but I'm a big fan of their pate chauds and their smoothies. i added boba to my jackfruit smoothie and it was the best drink i've literally ever had..."}
{"text":"Came in for something to eat/drink after dinner. Decided to get the sugar cane drink since that's what most of the reviews were for. Definitely alot of ice in the drink. I think i got 3 good gulps before I was done. Never had sugar cane before so I don't know if it was good since I have no comparison. But considering it was $4 for 1/3 cup of actual drink and there was literally no one else in the place while I was there I'm guessing the popularity of this place has gone down as well."}
{"text":"Favorite place to get banh mi. Kind of obsessed actually. Try the #1 combination or #6 BBQ pork. I get pate on every sandwich (some don't have pate but you can pay .59 extra for it). They have a deal to buy 5 sandwiches and get 1 free. It seems like a lot but it's worth it for someone like me who's obsessed or if you're splitting it with another person. It's really cheap and they'll give you a side of siracha as well. Clean restaurant and quick service."}
{"text":"I like this! Much better than the one in Cali!  The turkey sandwich is really good and the bread is great as well!  I also love how big the space is."}
{"text":"Good baguette, crunchy outside, soft inside.  You can smell the bread baking in the air.  We picked out two sandwiches, one pork and on chicken.   The pork is thinly sliced, the veggies also thinly sliced, and the is a very long thin slice of jalapeno.  It seemed a little dry, so it needs a bit more spread but not a bad sandwich. The chicken isn't as good, it's dry through and through, I don't think extra mayo would help. 

They also have boba's and I tried the strawberry.  It was very good.  Overall, a good sandwich, and know I'd try again."}
{"text":"Always a great experience here. Friendly customer service, quick ordering and preparation. 
Got their iced coffee and hot coffee, a bit expensive for hot coffee but worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent Lee's in Orange County, so when I found out there was one in Henderson, I had to come here while I was in town. This location is in a super busy area, but it is worth the trek and traffic to get here. All of the strip malls look the same, but luckily Lee's has a big sign so it was easy to spot. We ordered Bahn Mi's with grilled pork and two Vietnamese coffees, bc you can't come here and not order one. They are known for these coffee's and you can even buy the concentrate to make them. They are super strong, and definitely will perk up anyone's day. The sandwiches were delicious as expected, at amazing prices. The only thing that was kinda weird was that it was super hot in there, and it smelled a bit weird. They had fans blowing hot air from the back to the front, which didn't really help. But the bahn mi's were yum and the Vietnamese coffee was delish."}
{"text":"I love Lee's Sandwiches. I really like this location since it is open 24 hours! It is super spacious and clean and has the best bahn mi sandwiches. My favorites are the BBQ pork and grilled chicken, but I haven't had anything here that was disappointing. I believe if you buy 5 sandwiches, you get one sandwich free. The only thing that was weird was that after 9pm, they charge you a late night fee of 50 cents per item, which can get expensive. They are cash only, so with all of the money they are saving by not paying service fees, I'm not sure why they have a late night fee? Bizarre."}
{"text":"Cheap eats done machine-gun style. If you're expecting fawning service and polite smalltalk, keep walking, because Lee's is all about getting you in and out. Especially during the lunch crush. 

That's fine with me, because really all I want is to pick up my bag of relatively inexpensive sandwiches and get on with things. 

For more adventurous eaters, there are a wide variety of Asian sandwiches-and the menu is growing all the time. For the timid, all your favorite Sysco near-meat products are available on baguette or croissant. In addition to sandwiches, they have a small variety of Asian-street-foody options, many blended and mixed (soft) drinks, ice cream, and a dozen variations on the ever-popular highly-caffeinated Vietnamese coffee. 

Occasionally it smells faintly like cat pee, but that seems to coincide with the appearance of a fresh batch of durian ice cream. Durian: when smelling terrible is the sign of wholesome freshness!"}
{"text":"So far I love everything my wife and I ordered here mostly viet sandwiches and smoothi.  Cash only policy but the sandwiches are $2-4 bucks and the American sandwiches are little bit more pricey.  The sandwich is about 10\" long bagettes.  Clean and plenty of places to sit inside and outside."}
{"text":"Very fresh! Sandwiches are nice and cheap, mine was under $4, and served on fresh baguettes. The bread is his enough to eat on its own! I had the Bbq pork sandwich with everything on it. At first I was weary about the jalapeño but my mouth can take some heat and it turned out to be very complimentary. My only complaint is that I would have liked a little more filing, I typically prefer my sandwiches overfilled, but I would recommend and come back again."}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled pork banh mi. Had no flavor at all. Highly disappointed and reluctant to try anything else."}
{"text":"So.....what to say here. Place is really clean, has a cool decor and they play CNN on their TV.  

Sandwich was blah at best. My ham was kinda slimy like it was out of an Oscar Meyer package, the lettuce was barely there, tomato had green seeds, my cheese was like right out of the vending machine at a prison ward, I did get one whole package of mustard, there's no other sides to choose from, and their fountain drinks come from the back so you can't get refills.  

I wouldn't go back. Go next store to the beach hut sandwich place it's much much better."}
{"text":"I ordered #6 bbq pork sandwich and a large iced coffee. The bread was not hot as advertised and the iced coffee tasted like coffee flavored syrup with way more ice than \"coffee\". Overall the food was just average and the service was average."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches! The bread is so fresh and perfect. I love their grilled pork bbq bann mi. The pork is so juicy and flavorful and the veggies and pickles put it on another level. You can't beat the low price either! I am obsessed with their bread."}
{"text":"Update: So I returned to try the Asian meatball sandwich and did not like it at all. I love meatballs, but these were lacking in flavor big time. They needed more spices or a sauce on them. I wish the same guy was at the register to talk me out of it again. Also, a friend of mine go the bbq pork sandwich (based on my recommendation) and they totally skimped out on the meat portion. The sandwich had a few little sprinkles of meat here and there, so basically his sandwich consisted of mostly french bread and pickles. He didn't like it and thought I hyped it up...LOL! After my yucky meatball sub I probably won't go back unless I'm in the neighborhood and really craving some good french bread."}
{"text":"Bad customer service here. I was going to buy 10 coffee bottles but couldn't bring everything to the cashier at once. When I told the cashier to pick up 9 more bottles for me, he gave me an attitude and told to walk back there and get it. I didn't even get my 2 free bottles discount. I should've just went to Chandler."}
{"text":"This is a must-go-to place, whenever I'm in Vegas or LA for a quick bite. I love the iced mocha and grilled or bbq pork sandwich with extra pate. 

Quick and easy."}
{"text":"long story short (from a person who likes to talk a lot) - 

*Huge place
*Tons of sandwiches to choose from(get creative you can create your dream sandwich here)
* even appetizers, lots of sids, candy etc..
*tons of awesome drinks-yes get the tapioca in whatever you drink you so *desire..you already knew this though right?

DISCLAIMER::**TAKE CASH!! NO DEBIT/CREDIT ACCEPTED**


Your welcome.

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Don't order the avocado smoothie! They only put half a small avocado for a large smoothie and with an upcharge of .50 cents you'll get another 1/4 of fruit. It's all ice! The smoothie is barely green, It's just a rip off!"}
{"text":"Went here after a disappointing experience at The Boiling Crab.  I was still hungry.  So, it was almost midnight. 

I got the Dac Biet Banh Mi.  I was really impressed with the price and the size of the sandwich.  This was my first time at this chain.  It was about a foot long for about $4.75.  You can't beat that.  Even at the usual Banh mi shops, it's a 6 inch sub for $4.  So, this was a good deal to me.  The bread was on point.  It was fresh, crispy outside, soft and chewy inside.  The filling was alittle skimpy but if you consider the total size of the sub, it's not bad.  The filling i.e. meat and pate were nicely flavored.  Tell them to put the jalapeno on the side.. 

They had a great grand opening promo (poster on the door) where you got free Viet coffee with any sub purchase! STEAL!  A foot long sub and Viet coffee for under $5 is an amazing deal!  You gotta ask for it.  I noticed people around me didn't get the same deal. 

I was disappointed they didn't have the Viet coconut waffle.  I love those.  They said they didn't have any batter left. 

I noticed they had pate chaud  (French inspired Viet meat puff pastry) but I didn't want to have left overs b/c it was already midnight and I had a footlong I had to inhale. 

The Viet coffee was from a premade mix rather than made to order but it was free and we're in Vegas...we were craving the caffeine.  I noticed this was a common practice in Vegas with the other Viet restaurants we visited.  What happened to the single serving coffee drippers???!!! 

I liked sitting in the shop eating.  They had interesting snacks for sale and it was a very big and nice shop.  

LOVED that it was open 24 hours. 

Cashiers were friendly even at midnight."}
{"text":"I think this is a well kept secret although many go to Lee's day and night. The pricing is very resonalble for their popularity. Check it out and be sure to get some yogurt while you're there. Fresh baked breads taste and smell wonderful"}
{"text":"I've been to LEE'S SANDWICHES several times.  Yes, it's busy but they always have a lot of employees and the line moves along very quickly. 
5 Stars for keeping the eating area clean, great sandwiches, polite pleasant employees with smiles, affordable prices, and of course 5 stars for LEE'S Vietnamese Iced Latte!  So many wonderful drinks & smoothies, so little time!!!  And I can't mention the fresh warm baked baguette bread because then I will crave it until I drive down there and get my 'fix!'
We tried so many of the sandwiches.  In addition, my kid always orders the crunchy Hot Wings and I like the roll appetizers and my husband likes the sesame ball pastries. 
For such a busy place, 5 stars for keeping the restrooms clean.
Plenty of sitting areas and Wi-Fi available.

5 stars for giving back to the community...... I saw your  computer room that was offering free tax return help. Nice, very nice.  Thank you-"}
{"text":"got the banh mi combination, vietnamese ice coffee, coconut italian soda and the durian smooth here. the banh mi was really really good, same with the vietnamese coffee, it was the right amount of condense milk to coffee, the italian coconut soda wasnt anything special it was still good, but i will stick to the coffee, the durian i had better but i also had worst and this place the durian smooth was a 7 out of 10, the guy who was taking our order at the time i think was the manager and he was very friendly and he even knew we came from EDC and he talked about that with my group for a bit which i thought was pretty cool. 

thankfully i do not have to go all the way back to vegas to get Lee's sandwiches since they just opened one up by me in falls church. i have not been there yet but hopefully this place will live up to its west coast sister"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing!The Fresh crunchy bread makes the difference.I love the Barbq Pork sandwich with a side of hot suace poured on top.A sandwich is around 4.00.What a deal!!! They also have baked treats and Iced coffee.Lee's does it right and it doesn't cost a lot.

 Gary K."}
{"text":"Vietnamese coffee = hooked for life. Starbucks who?
Served iced, as it melts the flavors meld into sweet, smooth, heavenly goodness. 
Fresh bread - Soft, warm, cheap. 
Breakfast Sandwiches - Freshly baked croissants filled with bacon, cheese, egg, etc. 
Lunch Sandwiches - Tried the pastrami mustard and loved it. Very filling."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! Chandler is definitely lucky to have this bay area based chain in their city.. I don't think it's possible to find a better tasting banh mi anywhere other than Lee's.. They do it right everytime and I am never left feeling disappointed.. This location is located right across the street from Lee Lee's Oriental Supermarket, some pho restaurants, and a boba tea shop.. Perfect for anyone that has an appreciation for Vietnamese food.. I ordered a bbq pork banh mi ($3.05) with extra pickled veges ($0.25) as well as a grilled pork banh mi with extra pickled veges for later.. Since I am rarely in this area I took the opportunity to savor the taste of a perfectly assembled banh mi.. Everything was how it should be and tasted just like the sandwiches you would get at a Lee's in the Bay Area.. A chain that is consistent always does well when their food is great in quality.. Where else will you find something this tasty for only $3 a piece? When I am visiting Chandler again I will definitely drop by to pick up a few sandwiches.."}
{"text":"Love this place, the service is good and the for is always bomb! i always get the number 4 grilled chicken and the chicken pad de chau (definitely not spelling that correctly...). i highly recommend also the strawberry smoothie!"}
{"text":"Popped in Lee's to grab an iced coffee and grilled chicken sandwich before leaving Vegas. I thought this was a good idea because I love their coffee.  This location is huge, probably easily double if not triple some of the other ones I've been to. There are plenty of tables for customers. I am assuming there's a huge demand for cheap Vietnamese sandwich at all hours of the day/night since this is a 24hr location. My assumption is probably correct except holy moly, no cheap sandwiches at this Lee's! Everything on the menu is at least a dollar more expensive. What I pay for a large coffee back in LA can only get me a regular size. I guess the sandwiches are still cheaper compared to most American joints, but certainly not by the Asian standard.  

I waited a good 20 minutes for my sandwich and drink. And I'm not really sure why it took that long because there aren't many people ahead of me, and they had at least 2 people making the sandwiches.  My grilled chicken sandwich was pretty dry compared to the ones I've had in other locations. Not a fan of this Lee's and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I used to come here before I discovered where to get the perfect banh mi to my liking. I knew it was ahhhite, but would come anyway because my mouth would long for that banh mi experience. In HI, I used to go to Bale...it was worth scraping the roof of my mouth for.

Okay, back to Lee's. It's fun because they are 24hours, the offer an array of banh mi's, and serve other items I haven't bothered to memorize. They do sell other items in their refrigerated area if you are one of those out-of-towner who is looking to take something back. 

Honestly, my experiences with their banh mi sandwiches were....my sandwich was skim, and my bread would be in pergatory somewhere. Pergatory, meaning...wasn't quite toasted and wasn't quite cold. Then other times...I wasn't sure if it was stale or overly toasted. But how could that be possible considering I've gone on nights where they are in baking their french rolls. Perhaps I should've requested a fresh roll, but I don't like to make a big ole deal especially if we're talking about a 3 dollar something sandwich. 

Anyway, I wouldn't stray someone from coming here. I'd point them in a different direction first, though. But if you wanna come in and try it out...go ahead. They aren't that bad at all especially if it's 3 in the am and you find yourself desperate for a banh mi."}
{"text":"Had the bbq pork sandwich here a few times and its great and cheap.  The bread is awesome.  Had a pork and egg steamed roll also, not that good. Kept hearing about the iced coffee so i thought i would try it.  Also heard they put too much ice. So i order it with light ice and they give it to me packed to the top, i said i asked for light ice and he brings it back 3/4 full.  I pay $5 for a coffee and u cant even fill it up?  So if i got no ice i guess im getting half a cup or less?  Pretty stingy.  Coffee was good, nothing spectactular, wouldnt get it again"}
{"text":"this is a smaller Lee's sandwiches on Eastern, they may not have everything you want. But it's so close to me, i don't mind!"}
{"text":"it's a hit or missed with their banh mi. sometime it's taste so fresh, and sometime the bread taste kinda stale and chewy...a bit over priced, but it's a place to go to if you craved banh mi at 2 am. 1 draw back is it doesn't accept credit card, c'mon, you're a big corporation, you have restaurants all over CA, in vegas and oklahoma city and still doesn't accept credit card? even a smaller restaurant accept credit card!!!"}
{"text":"This place was a letdown.  I've wanted to try bahn mi for a very long time, so we stopped by this place soon after it opened.  Getting the food took a while, and the sandwiches barely had anything inside them.  They were dry, and didn't have much flavor. 
I guess I'll just have to try someplace else."}
{"text":"I would take this over Subway any day of the week. I have had better Vietnamese sandwiches but for convenience and how quick they are I would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place after hearing some friends mention how great the sandwich was.  They frequent the one in Oklahoma City.  

My wife and I went to Lee's after work.  The place was not very busy.  My wife ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a steam bun.  I ordered a B.B.Q Pork sandwich.  The croissant and ham were both hard.  The steam bun was soft and mushy.  Both were probably left on the warmer for a long time.  When you look at the sandwich, you can't see anything until you open the bread.  It was nothing like the picture.  I was expecting a lot more ingredients.  There was a thin layer of B.B.B Pork and vegetables.  The bread was pretty good.  I might go back and give it another try.  Hopefully the food will be a bit better."}
{"text":"This place is so damn awesome. First off it's dirt cheap. Sandwiches are about $2.50 to $3.00 a piece and if you want something really good, go for the more exotic ones. My favorite is their meatball which doesn't sound exotic at all but its a fresh french roll filled with Asian style meatballs, pickled vegetables, cilantro and fresh sliced jalapenos. So, so good! It's spicy though but it's one of the yummiest, cheapest things you'll ever eat (and as for the spicy, my toddler eats it so put on your big girl panties and quit complaining). 

The next best thing on the menu is their Lee's iced coffee. It's espresso and sweetened condensed milk served over ice. Sounds a little different, but it's heaven in a cup. The sweetened condensed milk balances out the bitterness of the espresso and the hot concoction melts the ice to the perfect viscosity for your libationary enjoyment. Hmmmm. I could go for one now. 

You can get this uncommonly delicious meal for about $5. What more could you ever want?"}
{"text":"I'm glad they opened up this location so I don't have to drive all the way to Chinatown! The staff is always so friendly & courteous! So many different varieties! You can never go wrong with a grilled pork sandwich!"}
{"text":"Edit: I completely forgot to come back and update my review!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered my 6 pack of frozen coffee to bring back to my current home - a 5-7 hour drive. I preordered the coffees with Casey and she assured me I could come in and it would all be ready. They offered ice for my cooler, and made sure I'd be set for the trip and the coffee would make it. This was by far the best customer service I've had in a long time. She (and the manager, I think?) was very informative about the different sandwiches that they are known for, offering recommendations for \"my first\" which was the BBQ pork. Very personable and asked about my life and got to know me a bit in the few minutes of interaction. Why am I mentioning this? Because I didn't feel like just another customer or $$. I felt like a friend or part of the family, very welcome.

My frozen coffee made the trip back to me still just as frozen as when I picked it up. I would like to get ahold of higher ups to inform them of my positive experience. Going above and beyond to make sure my experience was a great one. They deserve the recognition.

I tried this chain for the first time in LA and fell in love. Then when I discovered this location was on my road trip home, I HAD to do it. I was not let down. I might make semiannual trips to stock up and have a glorious bahn mi sandwich. Keep up the terrific work!

Amazing amazing amazing place. Casey (I hope I spelt your name correctly) was such a great help. I will come back to add to this review, but I'm so thankful for my positive experience here I wrote my review before I left the parking lot. A+++++++"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm moooostly not into anything they have going on there sandwich wise or anything else so I cant speak for anything other than the iced coffee. But if you're a coffee fan try out the iced coffee, holy wowza!  it's strong! sometimes a little too sweet and when i say strong be prepared not to sleep for days!

just keep in mind they only take cash and their ATM machine is ALWAYS broken. Also, at lunch time be prepared to WAIT, not only are there lots of people but some of their cashiers are slow as molasses. Pick up the pace and go bake bread if you don't know how to count!! 1 Star down for slow cashiers and another star down for cash only with an always broken ATM machine.

So all in all, coffee and all that is great, im sure the sandwiches are good too but i dont roll with the excess carbs."}
{"text":"So I had a strong craving for a Vietnamese sandwich, but I hadn't tried lees yet so I decided to check it out, and sadly I was a bit disappointed. I wasn't really into that strange red meat they put on it or the liver type spread on the bottom, the bread was delicious and my taro boba was yummy, but the spring rolls had too much lettuce and noodle. So I can't say I'll be back for sure. Oh well it was worth the try...... I guess"}
{"text":"I've driven by Lee's dozens of times and never even bothered to stop or was curious as to what they had to offer.  

That all changed after I saw a photo taken by Joyce W. of a delicious Banh Mi sandwich that came across my Yelp feed.

The flavors were through the roof!  Just the right amount of pickled daikon, spicy jalapeños, and fresh cilantro.  The baguette was still fresh even though I came in the evening.   

I went with #11 and #5, and both were really delicious.  Simple but very tasty, the best Banh Mi I've had in AZ easily.  

The Free iced coffee on check in was also delicious!  Now that I know I will definitely be back!

The affordable price is just a bonus, all that sandwich for under $4 each, #AllDayLong  

Cash only"}
{"text":"I've been coming to lees sandwiches almost every morning when I get back home from vacation and it has almost never cease to serve me a great sandwich! Always done in a timely fashion also."}
{"text":"I love Bah mi sandwiches! So happy that Lee's Sandwich is close by. Grilled pork #5 is what I always get. The baguette is always perfect and the meat, pickled veggies, and cilantro are so tasty! They also have the best iced coffee if you need a pick me up! The pastries are also yummy!"}
{"text":"I got the tuna and almond salad on a croissant. I added the house pickles (daikon radish and carrot) and cilantro. Delicious! I loved it."}
{"text":"When did Lees get so corporate??? I used to go to a Lees when I was younger and it was the best bang for your buck... But I guess either massive inflation hit or because this Lees is in Vegas... 

$4.50 for the number 1 special! That's nearly $5! What is this? A Vietnamese subway?! Banh mis are known for their value... Cheap eats, usually a banh mi would cost you like $3 or even buy 2 get one free... It might be this location? But if that's the price, Lees sandwiches have gone up. 

They also don't have nem anymore... But they did have cha lua and if you buy it they give you a loaf of bread... Great deal but you're paying $6 for cha lua... I guess I'm used to paying $1-2 less. Maybe it's this location... We made a pit stop to eat breakfast and got some sandwiches for lunch. It was okay..."}
{"text":"Very clean and welcoming lobby. One of the only places in Chinatown worth eating at. The variety of choices the menu offers is also worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Just have the best banh mi and fresh sugar cane juice yesterday and I love it.  Our family usually pickup coffee and food here before driving to LA"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches leaves much to be desired. I gave 3 stars for the other items they offer. But come on, people...they don't really have good banh mi's. I equate this to people who have no other available option and just don't know what a good banh mi should taste like....so they rate this truly sub-par place with a crazy 5 star review. I ordered my go-to combination banh mi, the #11. They barely put enough meat and/or pickled veggies in their sandwiches. When I opened my banh mi up, I was like What the heck is this?? Their saving grace is their baguettes, ca phe sua da (strong Vietnamese iced coffee) and other sweet treats they offer. Eggrolls are meh. Their banh mi's, no. Macaroons, no. Haven't had their boba yet, so I can't comment. But for a place specializing in banh mi's, they really could try just a liiiiitle harder.

Oh, and I am always skeptical about places that only accept cash. Like, really? You conveniently have an ATM inside? Sure, let me pay $3-5 dollars in bank/ ATM fees on top of my order JUST so I can pay you. Because you don't accept debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"i have to admit, the interior is pretty nice for a vietnamese place, (i can say that because i'm vietnamese....and i've visited quite a few vietnamese food businesses in my lifetime.) but don't let that fool you. if you're ever in southern california...more precisely in santa ana, you should go to the lee's sandwich shop there. now that's good stuff. it's pretty mediocre here...i dont know why. my mom got sick off one of their sandwiches so be wary! 

there is one thing that keeps this review from getting 1 star and that is their totally delicious and freshly made butter croissants! MMMMMM...."}
{"text":"Worst Lee's Sandwich ever!  I have been to several Lee's Sandwiches in San Jose and they are usually filled with so many variety of food items.  However, this one in Las Vegas (Spring Mountain Road), didn't even have spring rolls, rice plates, etc, and only had some small pastry dessert inside.  The store itself is really clean and big, but I don't even know why they have such a huge store if they don't even sell a lot of items.  

The customer service is also bad.  We ordered three sandwiches with extra vegetables and hot peppers.  The sandwiches were made and placed on the rear counter behind the register.  I had to flag down the cashier to tell her my sandwiches were ready for us.  Then when we opened up the sandwiches, all there was inside was the meat.  They put all the \"extra veggies\" in a zip loc bag and basically told us to add the veggies to each sandwich.  Lazy ass fools! 

Go somewhere else and save your money."}
{"text":"Glad they opened here in Vegas. Nth too special besides its new. It's just Lee's sandwich, quick bite for relatively cheap price as we r used to from Cali. They even have the same annoying-number-calling-computer-voice but just louder here. So more annoying! X( And their yogurt isn't very good and pricier than Yogurtland. Urgh~!"}
{"text":"Grilled pork sandwich and the red bean sesame balls are my favorite from Lee's.  & if I'm in the mood for a Vietnamese ice coffee lee's is one of the places to get it."}
{"text":"Stopped by after dim sum for smoothies. We got the avocado smoothie. Yummy! There were even chunks of avocado in it. Didn't get the sandwiches today but the dac biet is always my favorite. 

I also love how they sell prepared pate and mayo!

Always a good place. But there are better!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Lee's for a couple of months now (atleast once a week). Always order the same sandwich  (#5)... today it was disgusting, first the bread was soggy, not crunchy. And omg second, this is a \"grilled pork\" sandwich, no pork whatsoever, 99% grilled fat. So gross...and the forgot to put the jalapeños on it. So yea, I don't know if I would ever go back ......?"}
{"text":"Do I love Lee's Sandwiches?  Yes, in every way possible.  

Do I love their iced mochas?  Yes, more than life itself.

Do I love the number 5 sandwich?  Yes, but not as much as their iced mochas... yum!

If I had to find something bad to say about this place, it would probably be the same knock as everyone else -- they only accept cash.  Luckily, sandwiches are around $4.

Go to Lee's... but don't you sit in my favorite seat, ya hear me?!"}
{"text":"Everytime i come here theres never bobba! And they take forever to make sandwiches :/ save your money and time, go to the one on eastern and 215."}
{"text":"Came here to get some Asian sandwiches, the deal was buy 5 get 1 free, I got the combination, special combination and the grilled pork. This place is also open 24 hours."}
{"text":"If you take a gander at my profile you'll note that I have a penchant for ingesting food that would make a normal persons' stomach turn. That's right! Andrew Zimmern(BIzzare foods fame) is a pansy  and thus, what I usually saunter in for is their Durian shake.  So if you visit this place and suddenly smell some noxious fumes , look around for a daffy, grinning bloke holding a shake.

For 3 bucks their sandwiches are awesome (only cash please... wha.??!!). Overall in the grand cosmic view of things actually \"Meh\". Barbeque pork is my fave but have tried most of their other varieties as well. 
I 've nailed down the reason for me liking the sandwich to the pickled daikon and carrots as well as their eggy mayo that they lather in, topped with their fresh cilantro.  The meat used has always been rather tough and unappetizing. 

However they have way more choices in terms of desserts smoothies baguettes. The ambience is very similar to a fast food joint in HK, South Korea etc."}
{"text":"Too franchise like. Doesn't feel like a typical Vietnamese sandwich. But to be honest with you I couldn't find another sandwich shop around the area. The good thing about the place is plenty of seating with free wi-fi."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, great coffee and smoothies and pastries too! An awesome restaurant with a great modern vibe. I would suggest the number 11 combination plate! Always delish! Keep in mind these sandwiches are a little different from the average. Great new experience that will keep u coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Love coming here whenever I am passing by or staying in town. Super convenient and open 24 hours. I always get the combination sandwich and it has never failed me! They also have ice coffee that will wake you up with out a problem. They also have little snacks and drinks you can buy when waiting in line or just looking around."}
{"text":"This location is 24 hours, so we are able to swing by whenever we drive through town!  

The sandwiches are a great price for what you are getting: crunchy bread filled with flavorful meats and lightly pickled vegetables.  Lee's is always well lit and clean with the best customer service.  There is so much seating inside and we noticed an abundance of posters of Hillary Clinton eating at Lee's at our last visit.  The cashiers are always helpful with recommendations and order clarifications.  My go-to order is the grilled pork sandwich with vegetables on the side when I am not eating it immediately.  I also like to order the other Vietnamese goods like the pate chaud and egg rolls, but nothing beats the Vietnamese iced coffee here! So potent and so good.  

This place is consistent, inexpensive, and a great alternative to fast food sandwiches.  This is a guarantee stop whenever we drive through town on road trips."}
{"text":"The sandwiches #1&17 were good and can't beat the price, just wish they toasted the breads every time I ordered. I also had the buns (chicken & pork with egg) but I was disappointed with the flavor and quality.
Will probably only come back when I'm hungry for some vietnamese sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love lee's... But this review mainly is for the Cashier service... Samantha...not friendly at all!! Should not be in the cashier"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a friend and it was very good! I had the grilled chicken banh mi and he had the grilled pork (but I was totally jealous cuz the pork was better!). The sandwiches are cheap (cash only) and huge! I couldn't finish mine. The veggies on it give the whole thing a wonderful bold flavor and the bread is warm and fresh. Everything there is well priced, I would like to go back and try some different things. So I will be doing that..."}
{"text":"I like Lees. Always have since I was young. I am bummed that this location doesn't offer all the yummy sides that all Lees have in California, but I'm happy this is here."}
{"text":"Been coming to lees sandwich ever since it opened. I get a sandwich from here occasionally but I feel the baguette bread is a bit too tough, like it rips up the roof of my mouth. My favorite thing here is the ice coffee, it's sweet and strong and will get your morning started. I could drink it everyday if I wasn't afraid of gaining a grip of weight"}
{"text":"lee's has the best bread in Phoenix. I don't  know if thats much to brag about. Good none the less.  for less than 5 dollars you get a flavorful sandwich. I highly recommended this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Visiting and just stopped in to check out the new lee's and to grab a late night snack... Had iced coffee and banh mi combo...it was yummy as usual. Love that it's 24/7!"}
{"text":"This last few times i went in here they have been skimping on the toppings in the sandwich. The chicken Asian sandwich was very empty. I had to go home and put more stuff in it just to make me feel like i was not eating a plain baguette. Its good but hardly enough stuff in the sandwich.I picked up a coconut waffle that was sitting on the counter also that was pretty tasty when toasted in the toaster and put ice cream in the middle. About $8 dollars for 2 sandwiches and a coconut waffle."}
{"text":"I ordered the #14 sandwich. Should of know something was wrong when they took forever to have it ready. I was the only customer in the store. I ended up throwing up the entire sandwich, within a hour of eating it. I'll drive across town before ever going back to this Lee's sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Stars
Atmosphere: 4 Stars
Service: 4 Stars

I really like the modern interior of the Lee's Sandwich shop on Easter in Henderson. The staff seemed eager to answer any questions I had and took my order with a smile and a polite thank you. I ordered the Jambon (ham)  & Cheese with the anticipation that the sandwich would taste like the one I had in France last year, but I know you can't reproduce the flavors of a rural community like France. The meat was lacked the flavor I expected, but the bread and cheese really made up for that. My Girlfriend ordered a standard Turkey and Cheese that tasted amazing! I also ordered the Pork Bun to give it a quick taste test and was really surprised how good it was. 

I don't think this place is something that you absolutely have to try, but I was really impressed with the quality and quantity of the sandwich for the price. I think I'll continue to go back and sample the Asian sandwich line up they have. 

Give this place a try and I'm sure you'll be happy with the food."}
{"text":"My husband was ALWAYS talking about this place! Lee's this and Lee's that....so of course, we had to go. I was positive he wouldn't stop talking about it until we did. Right ladies? You know what I'm talkin' bout! Well, as much as it pains me to say this .......he was right. Shhhhh, I'll never live it down if he knew I said that! We had the Grilled Pork Bahn Mi and it was so tasty! So many different flavors that made your mouth do the happy dance! Everything was fresh and the baguette was simply delicious! We each had a large iced crack, errrr I mean coffee!! Best Vietnamese coffee around. We, rather I, usually get 2 because I demolish the first one like it's a shot! It's gotta have crack in it! Just sayin'.... we live in Glendale and drive all the way to Chandler when we get a hardcore craving for some Bahn Mi and Vietnamese iced coffee. The absolute BEST place!!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving it three starts intead of four stars because they COMPLETELY messed up my order.

So I went to Lee's for the first time ever. So this is my first experience/impression of it and since they messed up my order, I don't have a positive impression. 

I came in and wanted to order a BBQ pork Banh Mi. I felt like the cashier seemed a little rude but I don't think he was rude; I think it was the nature of his tone. It might be a cultural thing. I asked him which one he would recommend or what was good but he didn't really suggest anything. Oh wells.

So I wanted BBQ pork because I like it and I had it at other places. Once I paid, I wait for like 30 seconds, I hear the intercom call out numbers. I look down at my ticket and I realized my number is called. I am a little confused how they worked so quickly on my order but I just proceed and pick up my order. I didn't question it. I just took it home. Once I am home, I look at the sandwiches. There's apparently three in there, I thought they happen to split one sandwich into threes because I asked for them to cut it in half and I thought \"WOW is the bread that long?\" So I look at the ticket inside the bag, it reads grilled chicken x 3. However, I noticed in the bag, two of them are grilled chicken, one of them is something else. So this made me realize two things...

1. Not only they gave me the wrong order (although they confirmed my number when I stood up to the counter and I looked at my ticket a few times and I am like okay that's me!)...
2. But they also messed up the order that read chicken x 3 because it wasn't all chicken....

I am not even sure if the one I ate was chicken because it reminds me of pate... Anyways, it's decent. I like it. Good price. Soft/chewy bread. Sandwiches are something I'll go back for but the service I had the first time confused me and just worries me.

Note: There's free Wi-Fi according to the sign on the door. I didn't check if the Wi-Fi worked or not, I would assume it works just fine?"}
{"text":"Food: Vietnamese bbq sandwiches (Bahn Mi). This is a chain that never disappoints and I appreciate that consistency. The veggies are fresh and the bread crispy and freshly baked. We also order the turkey sandwich on croissant for my daughter and she loves it.

Service: I love the convenience of ordering through Yelp and then just swinging by to pick it up. Super quick and easy.

Location: off Eastern in the same plaza as Taco Y Taco and Smashburger. Easy parking in this large plaza."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Las Vegas. Open 24 hours a day 365 days a year. They have free wifi and affordable prices. Great place to hang out with your laptop or just get a quick snack before after going to the strip. European style baguettes are the best. 

Yum Yum."}
{"text":"I typically enjoy Lee's sandwiches but this location specifically employees moronic individuals who have Absolutely No Customer Service and do not give a $*** about their customers. This is my 4th time in Here and each time except the first has been HORRIBLE!!! I LITERALLY JUST LOOKED AT MY FOOD FOR 10 MINUTES until I said excuse me is that my order.  Oh ya he said and walked away and no one gave it to me. I had to raise my voice  a bit.  The chubby guy at the register did not help nor handle anything. The young guy who just clocked out was standing in front of the register and just stood there and watched me as well. Like OMG are you serious. And the man after I rose my voice finally started to give me my food and I said this food is now old as we ordered 25 minutes prior before their hey her food is on the counter revelation moment.  

I say the good is cold the egg rolls need to be replaced and the guy just looked at me looked at the bags looked at me and then started to replace the egg rolls. 

Now I am sitting at my desk my sandwich tastes disgusting the meat tastes old like its from days ago.  It sucks compared to the one on Spring Mountain and they all suck compared to the ones in California."}
{"text":"Quality food on the go before or after work.  They have raised their prices a few dollars but haven't lost its taste."}
{"text":"The price has gone up for their sandwiches its about 5 dollars for one.  They're good but not at that price.  I do like their vietnamese iced coffee they are strong but once again at the price they're asking for and size you get not worth it."}
{"text":"I discovered this little gem in the summer of 2005, thanks to the bored MBA interns in the office, who entertained themselves with lunch site exploration.  I was VERY hesitant to try an \"Asian Style\" sandwich, but the #12 Vegetarian sandwich has me HOOKED.  I'm a sucker for fresh ingredients such as the cilantro, jalapeños, yam, carrot, vermicelli, and daikon.  The bean curd sounds strange, but seriously, just go for it! It's certainly a winner at 3.5 grams of fat.  The #4 Grilled Chicken is delightful as well, but be warned that the chicken is not a \"tradition American sandwich\" type.  This also goes with the pork and jambon sandwich fillings.  Again, I say,  just go with it-- they work in the entire sandwich package :)  The Grilled Chicken is also a winner at only 4 grams of fat.  The spring rolls are prepared daily and are offered as appetizers.  I tried eating lightly and sticking to only them as a lunch, but they just aren't filling enough.  They are, however, perfect as an appetizer, which is of course what they are intended as.  One warning:  My unadventurous Midwestern meat-n-potatoes parents were unimpressed and confused by \"Asian style\" sandwiches.  Luckily for them, Lee's also offers an array of European style croissants and baguettes for stiffs.  Of course, all of the breads are baked in house!"}
{"text":"Lee's is an odd place. It's a sandwich shoppe + ice cream shoppe + bakery + coffee shoppe ... 

As a vegan I tried the veggie sandwich sans mayo and it was pretty tasty. I thought there was supposed to be tofu in it, but it was missing, so I'm not sure if I ordered wrong.

The flavors were great - so unique compared to the standard American stuff. The bread had a great crust and chew.

The only knock is the cash-only register. Uh, this is 2014 and you do operate in a strip mall. I could see a food truck being cash only - but a large operation like Lee's? Come on now kids ... must ... take ... plastico!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in a while and this reminds me that I must go again next time I'm in town. Whenever I go, I tend to get the Americanized croissant sandwiches whenever I come to Lee's, but their baguettes are good (if only they didn't tear up my gums when I eat them). Everything I have tried has been delicious and the prices really can't be beat. Much better than Subway and other sandwich stores any day. The variety of foods and drinks you can get here can sometimes be overwhelming. I will definitely have to try one of their drinks next time.

They only take cash though, so it can be inconvenient at times."}
{"text":"I come here strictly for the Bahn Mi sandwiches. I recommend getting the #1 and #11. They are both the combo sandwich. The steamed pork bun is also delicious Everything is so delicious and affordable. They are also known for their iced coffee. I had to try since everyone I knew was hyping it up. It was pretty good and very creamy. A little too sweet and strong for my liking. Its basically a vietnamese iced coffee. The service is always great and fast everytime I visit. 

This place is perfect if you are hungry and need something to hold you over. A MUST try!"}
{"text":"The banh mi here is great.  My wife (from Saigon) and I go here very often.  The banh mi is very similar to what my wife remembers back in Saigon."}
{"text":"Very friendly, clean and consist. I wish they were open 24/7 like the Lee's on the west side. The one downfall, I will say, is they generally are always out of the baked pastries I always want. The coffee is always on point though!"}
{"text":"The bread is tasty and you can take freshly made baguettes home with you as well.  Make sure that you wet them quickly though because they become hard in a day.  There is a way to soften them up but they don't taste the same after a day.  Their Boba tea are average to above average     The sandwiches are tasty and he selection is immense. The Dac Biet is the only sandwich I have tried because it is so tasty.  The egg rolls are below average.  4 stars due to the uniqueness of the sandwiches and the freshness and crispness of he vegetable within the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Fast, sweet, + friendly. The tables could be wiped down though which is why the 4/5. Thanks for the the delish food and hit the spot Vietnamese iced coffee!"}
{"text":"This is probably the biggest and the nicest Lee's I've ever went too. I'm originally from San Jose, CA and that is where the original Lee's Sandwiches was from. It was always packed and it was the place to go since I was a little girl. Knowing that there's one here in Vegas is very comforting! Although they don't have the authentic Vietnamese desserts and side dishes, it's still great to have their sandwiches and bao's. (If you ever go to San Jose/San Francisco area, you can message me for the original location) I usually prefer the grilled chicken or the vegetarian one. At this location, ask them for extra sauce inside the sandwich, I think it's a little dry if you don't. That's only if you like your sandwich a little juicier. The coffee is amazing but strong here so incase you're not use to the Vietnamese style coffee, you'll have the jitters for awhile lol. It has condensed milk in there! You'll definitely have a sugar high and a caffeine kickers haha! It's best to get it iced. You must try their coconut waffles! They make it fresh! Ohhhh! If you want egg rolls in chicken or veggie, they fry it fresh too!!! Okay, I just got hungry. Lol cheers my fellow yelpers! Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Good food. Fresh bread. Great atmosphere. Huge restaurant with plenty of seating. Always open."}
{"text":"The staff seems friendly. It was my very first time here about a week ago. I ordered the BBQ pork I believe...

I prefer Hue Thai and Pho Thanh Sandwiches to this. It seemed very bland and plain to me. Maybe when I go back again, I'll try something else, but it was bleh to me. My friend got the grilled pork (which is what I love at Pho Thanh), but it wasn't that much better.

Because it's a 24/7 location, I would be back here just cause it's one of the only things open and the prices are pretty cheap if I want a late-night snack for cheap.

Otherwise, I doubt I'd be here in the daytime.

PS. They're cash only. But they do have an ATM in the building."}
{"text":"Not bad at all....the bread was nice and toasted and they put a good amount of meat. My Thai tea was okay, it wasn't sweet enough for me. The egg rolls were my favorite, I didn't think it was going to be good because it's been sitting there but it turned out pretty good and crispy. I also had the pork bun, honestly I only ate the inside part (my favorite part). All in all, I would come back if I was to ever go back to the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Best \"banh mi in Vegas\" is like being the best sushi in topeka, kansas... Yeah. 

I don't know why it is so hard to replicate a frickin sandwich, decent enough when.you get it in the ghetto tenderloin of SF, somehow doesn't make it to Chinatown Vegas. 

First off, the quantity of the meat was super lacking. The placement of the things inside was haphazard (why do I need to rearrange the inside of my sandwich?), even the shrimp rolls were super meh. Soggier than usual. Even the peanut sauce seemed off. 

24 hrs, great for plane food for the ride home, cheaaap beyond compare, decent smoothies and we made it for \"happy hour\" so $.99 smoothies make me happy. 

But somehow I wish we had found a better hidden gem for our plane food for the ride home..."}
{"text":"Good place to have a Vietnamese sandwich and it's open 24/7 the Combination is my favorite and there already made coffee is amazing too"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a banh mi and Vietnamese coffee! Their bread is good too. I like the veggies that they put in their banh mi. But my fave is their coffee! So good!"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, decent, and open late. Their service is friendly and there are more than enough sandwiches to choose from, so I really don't understand why many of the reviews here are so negative. Sure, I've had better bread, better sandwiches in general, but what do you expect from a place that never closes? 

If you look at Lee's for what it is, a convenient and affordable late-night snack, then you'll be satisfied with what you get."}
{"text":"I tried the Lee combination sandwich, the pate, and the grilled pork sandwich for lunch today. I like my sandwiches to be stuffed with a lot of veggies and some meat and I like the bread to be minimal. I can't say that about Lee's. Their sandwich had more bread than stuffing. But boy, was it delicious! The pate was just the right kind of flaky, and delicious. I needed a drink to wash down the sandwich because it felt too dry. I like that the restaurant is so big and spacious. But I wish they'd accept cards."}
{"text":"Well I will say my husband IS IN LOVE with this place. I think its because the type of job he has and works graveyards and lets face it, fast food gets old. But I digress, back to the food. This is the first real experience ive had with sammichs from.. where they come from.. The bread is ok very crusty and it really does get all over you but lends itself to hold the banh mi (Grilled chicken) I dont try anything else bc I can probably make a better sandwich at home myself. The pickled daikon are sweet and gives alot of contrast to the meat and the other ingredients. 

Theres also some heat on this sandwich via fresly sliced raw jalepenos on the sandwich.. FYI be careful because the first time I had this sandwich not realizing what was on it  I got a mouth full of jalepenos and I thought I would never be able to feel my lips again. (if you enjoy pain, have at it). 
In all fairness when I do come back its only with the hubby because hes working I know what to expect, nothing more nothing less. 

They do have awesome smoothies, italian soda's freshly made (mango is my fav).  which kind of confuses to me but I guess since its considered to be a sandwich shop I guess it makes sense.

Location is 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Crazy iced coffee to get wired on but a little pricey for a beverage. Decent menu for sandwiches though prices ok. A little bit of a language barrier ordering but I'll go back again."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get banh mi. This place has the best baguettes that really makes the sandwich. Also, it is open 24 hours.

They are famous for their banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) but their menu has definitely expanded over the years. They now have pastries and desserts that are all quite yummy.  I haven't tried most of them because I'm always too full to eat anything more, but the ones I have tried are delicious. This place is not on the strip but is pretty close to it.

Their lee's coffee is a favorite. It may be too sweet and strong for some, but if you let the ice melt a bit, it tastes perfect.

When in Vegas, you can always expect to see me here at least once (but I usually come multiple times). Cheap, easy, and filling."}
{"text":"About the same quality as the spring mtn location, but slightly more generous on meat. Seems to have all the same things but no froyo, not open 24/7 (7a-9p), and they're strictly cash only for now. 

It kind of smells like sewage right now, but assuming that's just a temporary problem. At least this stores soft opening seems to be going way smoother than the other one. Only 5 min wait not the 45 min clusterf*ck I experienced last year"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because it has a great rep in Cali, its 24/7 and clean. I gave it a second chance and although the kinks in service seem to have been fixed, the food still sucks. 
Positives - bread is soooo good! Pastries and coffee soooo good! But its a sandwich shop and they continue to be ridiculously skimpy on the amnt of meat (had grilled pork again), picked veggies are kind of bland guessing not soaked long enough. So I give up - no more Lee's for me"}
{"text":"Lee's Sandwiches has good bake goods, sandwiches and smoothies. It is clean and the workers are friendly."}
{"text":"They have very good sandwiches and boba drinks. I usually get few sandwiches Togo for later because they keep really good in the fridge for a day or two. Just ask to pack the veggies on the side. Then, put the sandwiches in the toaster before eating. 
I've been here many times but today it was very messy. There was someone cleaning but he seemed behind and in need of help. The door handles were greasy too, yuck! 
They have macaroons now but that's not why we were here for, so maybe next time. 
We tried their pork bun with egg today. I'm not a fan but it tasted ok."}
{"text":"I *really* wanted to like this place more, considering it's HUGE and there seems to be so much variety on the menu. The yogurt area was the first thing that caught my eye, but was surprised to know there really wasn't as many toppings to be expected (if even at all). It's open 24 hours, and the entire place looks like a gigantic cafeteria. Bright lighting, plenty of seating. The night I came in with my friends the place was nearly empty, so no issues with finding a spot. 

We had the cream puffs and the sugar cane drink. Cream puffs lacked taste, as I felt like the cream in the middle really wasn't anything significant or tasty (the cream was just \"there\"). I do have to say the sugar cane drink is worth giving a go, since it's sweet but not overly sweet to where you get sick of it halfway. Otherwise the pastries and the bite of the sandwich my friend got wasn't anything special. Also, I always seem to think places who just offer cash as a paying method is behind with everything else technologically in the world unless it's a family business. Hopefully the next time I go the experience will be different."}
{"text":"They (the franchsie) make the best vietnamese coffee!!! Wish there was one in Tucson :( Nearest one is in chandler.  My favorite sandwich is #11 combination. Lee's Sandwich is the best place to get a Bahn mi."}
{"text":"I remember a time when going to southern California was the only answer to getting my banh mi fix and Lee's Sandwiches was the place to fulfill my craving.  Those were the days.  When Lee's Sandwiches opened up in Arizona, I was pee-in-my-pants ecstatic!  

There's really no bad sandwich here.  I love their pickled daikon and carrots, the pate spread, the headcheese, fresh cilantro, spicy jalapenos, and the cold cuts selection here.  No matter the arrangement, it's always delicious.  There's really no such thing as a bad banh mi at Lee's!

Lee's Sandwiches also sells ice cream, Deli Manjoo Cakes at their own little kiosk, and hot pastries.  The pork pate chaud is one of my favorite things to get.  It's a tiny meatball inside layers of flaky crust.  Yum!  If you need  some pure caffeine on long torturous days, I recommend the Vietnamese iced coffee.  That stuff is strong.  For a sweeter beverage, I reach for their sugarcane juice.  

Remember to bring cash or risk using their sketchy ATM machine.  It's seriously suspect.

{"text":"Went in ordered steam bun and egg roll. When I asked one egg roll, the man there says, \"Did you want two?\" (LOL)...when I ordered water the water was not included and I had to go back and request for again.   I had to wait for about 4 people to make in order before I got my water... When I open my bag I noticed there were no napkins included... Food is decent service, well...not so great."}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming here to Lee's
The prices are great, service is usually pretty fast.
I love the veggies they put on the subs. I usually get the pork or bbq sub they are really good.
We both love the coffee. They put a lot of ice in it and if you ask for less ice it is the same amount of coffee anyway but it is so good!!! When it is gone you want more.
Its not too cheap but it is delicious! 
The baguettes are so fresh! I love when the sell the pieces in the bag its so cheap!
never tried the desserts yet but some look really good.
We would come back and we recommend if you haven't been here you need to try it!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Lee's in Irvine, CA all the time as an undergrad and had to make a lil' nostalgic trip on through while in China town. The service at this location was horrible.
   I waited in line (only one in line) for five minutes before I kindly asked if I was in the correct line. The cashier told me yes, and continued what she was doing. When she was done she said \"... you can order...\" and wasn't even looking at me or standing at the cash register. I ordered and was charged more than the menu price so I questioned why, she told me because I ordered a large. I pointed out the large was less than what I was charged and she shuttered \"... oh... um, they changed the prices\" which would have been fine had that had been her reasoning in the first place. 
    It wasn't even busy. And that is the ONLY way I forgive bad service... Guess I'll only go to Lee's in CA"}
{"text":"i like the fusion in the sandwiches, really tasty! wish i tried it sooner. love the noodle place across the street. 

was looking forward for a sandwich before work, and to have another later for lunch, put in my order and handed my debit card. \"only take cash, but you can use the ATM in store\" ... i asked if they were going to discount me the $4 sur-charge they had as well as the $1.50 my bank charges!!!  of course they wouldnt! no sale!"}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed Lee's sandwiches in the past, but the food from here was okay. BBQ pork sandwich was a 2-star. The bread wasn't how I remember the Lee's baguettes. Maybe it was the texture, it didn't have the crunch on the outside followed by soft bread in the inside. 

Egg rolls were not too shabby. 3 stars. 
I'll stick to the hot food items and skip the sandwiches here next time."}
{"text":"I came to Lee's to grab a bite while my car was being repaired across the street and it was great!   Had a house milk tea with boba and a bbq pork bao.  Both were tasty and delicious.  They have a lot of comfy seating and it's nice, cool and clean.  If your in the mood for a nice bite come here and try some of their goodies :)"}
{"text":"I love love love that they finally opened a location in AZ. Have been a fan from CA and now got my wife hooked on it."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be thanking French colonialism for anything, but Vietnamese sandwiches are a really fucking good idea.

Buttered baguette topped with delightful roast pork, veggies, peppers and cilantro? Brilliant. Just $2.85? I'll take three. 

Plus, at Lee's, you can eat your tasty treat in an eerily efficient, sterile cafeteria. Trust me, it adds to the je ne sais quoi of the whole thing. Throw in a super-sweet, super-creamy iced coffee and a trip to Lee Lee afterward, and you've got yourself a pretty perfect afternoon.

So yeah, L'Indochine francaise may have set the stage for the Vietnam War. But it also gave us delectable sandwiches at low, low prices. Let's just call it even."}
{"text":"I've been to Lee's Sandwich many times in California and in chandler, AZ and haven't get a chance to write a review. Today I've went to the one in Chandler, the environment is nice for a hang out with coffee and Vietnamese sandwiches.

I ordered the number 11, which is the combo.  I have to say that it is not the best Vietnamese sandwich I've ever eaten because the bread is  hard and the taste kind of bland. I feel like it's not the original Vietnamese banh mi where they use Vietnamese baguette, which is a little smaller and softer and more tastier. I also ordered Vietnamese coffee, I just feel that it is more ice than coffee. I couldn't even stick my straw in. 

Overall this place is decent if you need a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I really like the customer service in this store. They are very friendly and patient with their customers. They got our orders done quick. 

I love how cheap the prices are for their sandwiches and let me just tell you how BOMB they are. They're really authentic and i haven't found another store to buy a baguette alone that is most similar to the ones in France but here. The meat is really nice and juicy and if you don't want certain things like jalapeños, (like me) they're more than glad to not add it on for you!"}
{"text":"Very clean and spacious place in the midst of china town. Very helpful, speedy staff that makes fresh baked goods, smooth, tasty smoothies n iced coffee, delicious vietnamese, american, euro style sandwiches, dry packaged goods and more. We pre-ordered our sandwiches during lunchtime to beat the rush, easy ordering, fast, accurate pickup and yummy sandwiches & goodies. FYI: Cash only and if you forget, Lee has an atm there for you."}
{"text":"I was roaming the streets of Vegas and wanted some Vietnamese sandwiches so I found myself here. Nice, clean store. I was greeted by a scary looking Asian guy, I think Tan was his name? Anyhow, it's true to not judge a book by its cover. He was very attentive and helpful explaining some of the items in the sandwiches. Thank you for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"This is probably the only best Vietnamese sandwich place in town. It is clean inside and they have a big variety. They bake their own breads, too. 

They used to have a stamp card or free sandwich deals but they have since gotten rid of it. I tried to set up an app where they do their new rewards system but it constantly crashes and doesn't work so I don't use it. They also don't advertise or talk about it at all, so they possibly have even gotten rid of that."}
{"text":"Lee's we have come a long way baby, you and I have really got something going on.

I am hooked and crave you constantly. Why do I have a constant simmering need and want for you? Your baguette bread is delicious chewy and always fresh, your BBQ pork is very tasty and your pickled veggies with sweet house mayo make my taste buds happy! Just a great combination of flavor and some really good bread just do it for me!

I have been to Lee's so often that I have filled and redeemed the buy 10 get 1 sandwich free cards a few times now.

I feel bad for my sweet boyfriend because my craving for this BBQ pork bahn mi sandwich is so often that he is tired of the sandwiches. :( He has tried them all, meatball, combination, BBQ pork etc and all are great but he just can't eat their several times a week like I can.

I am addicted to this simple delicious and filling sandwich. My first visit and review was not so good however I gave them another chance and now am glad to report the goodness is consistent!

I also enjoy their spring/egg rolls as well."}
{"text":"Best strong coffee around!!!! If you like strong coffee your in for a treat. They offer an original and a triple shot. Even the original packs a sting punch. It's Vietnamese style coffee so it's mixed with condensed milk so it's a little thicker then regular coffee, almost more like a chocolate milk consistency. I don't personally have much experience with anything but the coffee but my girlfriend loves the sandwiches and tea. She says the bread is the best it's super fresh."}
{"text":"nice.. 24 hr bun mi.. how can u go wrong!!"}
{"text":"great quality subs that they put great meats on and when im talking great meats alot of meats which makes any man happy especially after a long day of work great subs quality is there and gets me full at satisfied everytime!"}
{"text":"I was craving a sweet drink so I stop by 30 min before they close on a Wed and ordered a milk tea. The wait is horrendously long, WHY? It's milk tea, there is no blending. You just mix the cheap powder with milk and put that through a machine to seal it. Why does it takes 10 min to make milk tea? I do not understand. Ridiculous!!!! This is my 3rd time and  the wait is always long. I am done coming here."}
{"text":"Clean, TAKES credit cards unlike the ones in OC and makes baguettes on the daily."}
{"text":"I should have been to this place before now. The sandwiches are so good. All the sandwiches are made on either baguettes or crousants. What also makes this place special is that they always open"}
{"text":"Love #5- grilled pork yumminess! The baguette is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. With cilantro, daikon, carrots, and jalapeño! :) for about $3 you can't complain! Much healthier than running through a fast food joint."}
{"text":"Beautiful and exotic sandwiches, delicious smoothies (make sure you ask for boba!), and a bizarre ambiance make this one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona.  Cash only, but so worth it."}
{"text":"If you've never had a Vietnamese submarine sandwich, you're in for a treat.  They cost quite a bit less and taste much better than the typical Sub that you'd get at the most popular nationwide chain, but if you prefer the Euro/American style subs (which typically include cheese) they have those too at a slightly higher price.

While the sandwiches are low cost, almost everything else is a little higher price than elsewhere, so the total price of a meal here comes out to be about the same as their American style competitors, but once again these Vietnamese sandwiches have a taste of their own and I'm addicted to 'em!

Up until recently everything was served ala carte, but now they offer several different combo meals that can save you a few dollars.  

The location is very modern and clean looking.  The only complaint is that they keep the trash bin and napkin/fork/straw rack towards the back of the dining room instead of near the exit, so if you're leaving and want to throw your trash away you have to go back into the store to do it.  The other minor thing that could be improved is if they offered some sort of customer loyalty incentive.  I go there 2 or 3 times a week, most of the people know me there... it just would be nice to get something for free once in awhile.  Once again, not a major complaint, especially since very few other fast food places offer those incentives anymore.

The sandwiches and pastries are outstanding.  Their coffee is the best (albeit fairly expensive).  They've recently started selling Vermicelli Noodle dishes for @ $5 ( their competitors charge @ $9 for similar fare) but the Lees version is only so-so compared to those competitors."}
{"text":"I go here 2-3 times a week, while working in that area. The food is always Awesome and I am never disappointed. They treat my team very nice, and when we go in they remember my name."}
{"text":"I absolutely love love love lee's sandwiches. Best part? This location is open 24/7!!!! I tend to get their ice mocha but with extra ice (delicious). They also have other coffee and boba drinks. They've got a menu full of different types of sandwiches and food but I really enjoy getting the small stuff up front like the pork buns or little pastries. They're a lot faster to grab and go and actually very tasty! My favoriteeeeee is the 3 beignets for $1. You can't beat that for a little dessert / snack!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Vietnamese sandwiches... or really sandwiches in general.  But I love the egg rolls here.  You can get a whole box of them for like $20 and they are really tasty so its a great thing to pick up for a party.  Way better than the frozen kind and just as cheap."}
{"text":"Didn't get the hype.

I ordered the special combination. it was just okay. The bread was just a little too crusty. If i get more crumbs on me than I do bread in my mouth, something ain't right.

The mayo on it was some cheap kind so it was very oily and slick on my tongue. 

I attempted to order some Spring Rolls. They took my money and then told me they were out the wrappers. WTF?

I ordered \"hot wings\". Not so hot and I had to ask for them when they called me up to give me my order. So not okay. 

And I didn't understand the wait for the sandwhiches. I have never in my life waited 20 mins or more for a bahn mi.

Will I go back? Maybe... They did have yogurt and I want to try that."}
{"text":"Came to Lee's Sandwiches today for the first time. Thought I'd try out the hype, but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Upon arriving I looked at the menu and didn't see anything that had really caught my eye. They have a variety of Asian and European sandwiches, I got the vegetarian that has a variety of veggies and a yummy sauce I'm not too sure what it is. The only thing I really didn't like is that they don't let you use your card for orders under 10 dollars and neither my cousin or I had cash so we had to combine our order which makes it inconvenient when thinking you're just going to pay for one meal."}
{"text":"I am not sure if it is the fact that this Lee's Sandwich is located in Las Vegas, that the owners feel compelled to follow the lead of other well-known and loved California-based eateries (i.e., Pinks Hotdog, Sam Woos) that set up shop here, by jacking up the price and cutting back on what it serves.  At least that is what I think after visiting Lee's post their officially grand opening.  Sandwiches still taste the same, except you just get less of everything that goes in between the fresh baked baguette (meat, pickled radish and carrots and even cilantro and slices of chilie).  Iced coffee still tastes great, except you get more ice than coffee.  Even if you ask for less ice, you will get less ice but also a cup that is not full (imagine an inch of nothing to top of your plastic cup).

Anyway, the place is new and very nice looking.  Staff is still trying to master the sandwich menu, so I am sure eventually they will get faster with fulfilling the orders.  But unless they start to serve what we can get normally at all the other Lee's sandiwch shops up and down California, potential customers are better off patronizing other local banh mi shops.  And there are quite a few of them just a few blocks down Spring Mountain Rd.

I wish I can like this Lee's Sandwich more, but after a few visits I am too disappointed to want to go back.  As it stands, I feel that this Lee's is trying to set the bar extremely low for what customers should expect from this location, perhaps not realizing that a vast majority of the patrons have had the Lee's experience from California prior to visiting this one.  I can only guess that as a new food service operator in Las Vegas, they failed to do any sort of market or demographic analysis and/or extremely ignorant of the commonsense knowledge that roughly 50% of the visitors that come to LV are visiting from CA (land of the Lee's Sandwiches).

So we will see how well they fare after the novelty wears out, because without a course correction I see only iceberg ahead for this Titanic of a Lee's Sandwich.

(UPDATE) - From David Y: A worker told him to ask for \"less ice and more coffee\" when ordering their Lee's Iced Coffee, otherwise the future lawyers fulfilling the orders behind the counter will do exactly as the customer requested. How knew ordering a effing cup of the common Vietnamese Iced Coffee is the stepping stone to studying for the LSAT."}
{"text":"Pros: its 24 hours, theres alot of variety on the menu, pretty central location, and spacious area to hang out in
Cons: cash only, some menu like spring rolls are blah

overall I'd say its a decent place, good for if I need a late night snack in chinatown. Its reliable in the sense that your experience is always pretty positive"}
{"text":"Customary lee sandwich chain.   Ok to satisfy craving but not the best.  Sandwiches are ok but the baguette can be a little fresher.  Banh bao was quite dry."}
{"text":"I was glad to see a Lee's Sandwich shop here in Vegas. We stopped here to get some lunch for the road and this was after our gambling losses. We thought that such a big establishment would at least accept debit cards but they don't. Cash only! There is an ATM machine inside but what a bunch of bologna. Not to mention that everything on the menu is more expensive than at the Lee's Sandwiches in Orange County. They are also stingy on napkins and the picked carrots for the sandwiches. Overpriced for what it is. Sandwich was decent, pate chaud weren't good at all (meat was too sweet)."}
{"text":"This shop is bigger than other Lee's I have been to. I just love biting into their warm and fresh bread accompanied by all the traditional banh mi ingredients.

I originally gave this particular store 4 stars but when I unwrapped my to-go banh mi I discovered they put a generous amount of cilantro on it when I told the cashier twice not to put it in my sandwich at all. Yes, I am one of the select few that cannot stand the soapy taste of cilantro. He repeated my order back to me before proceeding so I thought he understood. I guess not.

Overall, it was a good sandwich and I enjoyed browsing their grocery item goodies while waiting for my order."}
{"text":"Best banh mi's in Phoenix metro! Pretty cheap too! The French bread, liver paste and fillings make this an all-around great Viet sandwich!

They do Euro deli's too, but it's more worth it to come for the Viet sandwiches.  It's a clean and spacious place.  Most people order to go.  They also serve other Viet snacks and drinks too!

Come try if you have not!"}
{"text":"BBQ Pork sandwich was decent but one of the more forgettable Banh Mis I've had. The inside of the restaurant has ample space (unlike the parking lot) and even some groceries, but it felt kinda like a Vietnamese Subway restaurant...not really any charm.

Update: Grabbed another sandwich to take on a road trip...this time the Pork Meatball. The pork had absolutely no flavor. I took two bites and threw it away. Only positive this time was the iced coffee."}
{"text":"No. Sorry, but horrible wait and they can't get the numbers right. Customer #5 does not get their order before customer #2, even if it's the same order. It doesn't even make sense!! 

My friend ordered the green waffle and Miss customer #5 ordered the green waffle and a thanksgiving feast...they gave #5 the green waffle first without using the electronic Numbering system and had both her (and us) continue waiting.  Not efficient. Then they rushed my friends order and the waffle came out flaccid and wet like a sex tape gone wrong. 

I'll give an additional star for the nice employee who took our order, and the fact that the rest of us got the correct items, but the wait and inconsistency of following service protocol (using the machine to call out numbers when the full order is ready) is ultimately going to chase away many customers (and stars). 

Come here for the name, but expect to be called out of order even if you all ordered the same item. Don't expect any consistency in wait times regardless of the amount if customers present."}
{"text":"If you like good, fresh, sandwiches, then you have to try one here at Lee's. I think the bread is what really makes the difference, it is super fresh and would taste good all by itself! Its much cheaper than any other sandwich shop and definitely seems fresher and less assembly line. I think the only thing that can be hit or miss here is the service from time to time, but that is soon forgotten with a sniff of the fresh bread.  Yes they do only accept cash but that is as they say, to keep the prices down.  I usually order the ham and turkey club and a water and i get out of there for about 5 bucks.  I also love the fresh baked baguettes...so good!"}
{"text":"You've gotta come here and get one of their baguettes.  They are the freshest, softest and most flavorful baguettes from anywhere in the whole Valley.  One of their fresh warm baguettes and a couple of tablespoons of soft, sweet cream butter and you have yourself the best breakfast in the world!

They also create amazing Vietnamese sandwiches using those same delicious baguettes.  It's all amazingly fresh and tasty, but we forewarned before you arrive that they are a cash only operation, so hit up your bank's ATM on the way, or pay the convenience fee to use the freestanding ATM inside of Lee's."}
{"text":"The bread was very good.   The sandwich (pastrami) was just average.

Prices are all reasonable and a pretty large menu.  I'm guessing  (hoping)  some of the asian sandwiches  rise above average.

Probably  a 3.5."}
{"text":"I love the turkey croissant sandwiches. Also they bring the Asian flavor with the combo with choice of an egg roll . Always fresh and delish. Very inexpensive for quality food. Also reminds me of home (los angeles ). Happy yelping and always stay happy.xoxoxo"}
{"text":"We always get bobba drinks here. There quick, yummy and dependable. Can be busy, but it never effects the service."}
{"text":"This is a 3 1/2 star review rounded up. I decided to round up instead of down based on the great customer service. A friendly and helpful attitude made all the difference. 

When I walked in I was greeted warmly. The menu is enormous and the guy behind the counter was more than happy to assist with my ordering. I didn't personally need any help, but I appreciated his eagerness. After decided on a sandwich and an iced coffee, I paid. My food and drink was ready very quickly and I was on my way. It wasn't the best banh mi I've ever had, but it was definitely tasty. For about $5 I got a drink and sandwich for lunch. I can't argue with that. 

My banh mi was pretty spicy, which I like, but if it's not your thing make sure you let them know in advance. I'll be back for a quick bite at lunch since I work in t he area."}
{"text":"I was driving in the area and just noticed that this new Lee's location just opened up recently. 

I quickly flipped a U and decided to stop in for some banh mi. Service was friendly and my order was ready quickly. 

I rushed home and the bread was perfectly baked and the sandwich was spicy and had just the right mixture of ingredients. There was plenty of meat and tons of delicious pickled veggies. Decent chain location and nice slush options minus the overcooked boba.

They take credit card for orders over $10. Glad to have a more food options on this side of town."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to try Lee's Sandwiches.  I have seen these franchises before, and I have always wanted to try their Vietnamese sandwiches.  My curiosity is now satisfied.

We shared the #5 Grilled Pork Sandwich and the  #11 Special Sandwich.  Both sandwiches tasted bland to us.  Nothing special at all.

Were there good things about the restaurant?  Yes.  The restaurant was clean, service was fine, and prices were fair.  Oh yeah, the Jackfruit smoothie was pretty good too.

I probably will not return here anytime soon.  Maybe another location in the future.  In Vegas there are many other places to try first before coming back here."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with their iced coffee, club sandwich and cream horn. That is a meal from heaven"}
{"text":"This location has had at least three other restaurants that did not make more than a few years. Very glad there is a new business in this location. 

The good.......We now have a new business in Peoria. I like the layout of the shop. Very different from any other place I have visited. Great visuals of the sandwiches. Ordering is easy then go to your table and wait for your number to be called. There is a very extensive menu. Everyone should be able o find something they like. 
Still on yer good....Everyone, (4 at out table), got something different. Everyone at the table remarked that their sandwich was good. I will definitely see them again. Their iced coffee is strong and taste. I did like it. 

The bad.......Really there was not anything I would call bad. 

The ugly.....The wait. After we ordered there was a 20+ minute wait. Definitely not fast food. Yes this is a new place with new people. Hopefully they will get it together. I do like the concept,"}
{"text":"This place has a huge area for seating and is generally pretty busy and packed with Asians which is saying that it is a good cheap place to eat.

The in house baked baguette bread for their sandwich are awesome. My favorite is the bbq pork sandwich with double meat. If you don't get the double meat you are eating almost just bread. Their spring rolls are pretty good and a decent size and their little egg rolls are a good buy. 

You can't beat the prices here for an inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"I drove by this place so many times but never really stop by here until now (and have cash on me). 

I came in completely lost. They have so many sandwiches to choose from and my stomach is only big enough for one. I ended up ordering number #11 that everyone else on yelp seems to recommend and a Taro Boba milk tea. The sandwich is so good i ended up having the other half for lunch (and it was still good). The taro drink is also flavorable. 

On my way out, I also purchased some cookies and Macaroons to go. It has the matching color for the flavor...but unfortunately, it doesnt taste like it. I ordered coconut, mocha, green tea flavor Macaroons but they all taste the same - sweet but not much else. I was disappointed since I love Macaroons. 

Nevertheless, the cashier at the corner was super friendly. The dining area is spacious and clean. Ill definitely come back here to try out other sandwiches for sure."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are amazing here and so like no where else in the valley. Beware that they only accept cash, there is an atm in the restaurant though. The coffee is my favorite on the menu, some rich, creamy and simple."}
{"text":"They're horrible. 

\" Big warning \" Do NOT come here in the early morning when they only have old stuffs for sell\" 

I came here few times. Every times I got at least 4-5 sandwiches. For the previous orders, the breads were hard but still ok to eat. This time when I made my order I asked the guy nicely that I want the fresh bread because I don't eat them all right the way. They get harder later with old bread. He went to talk to someone and I made the order. Guess what I got? I couldn't get myself to get send bite because the bread was so hard. I came and showed the guy to touch it to see how hard the bread is. How can ppl can eat this? He went to talk to someone, came back and offer me that he can heat it up for me. An old bread and heat it up, let me tell you it will become a rock that can kill some one in not even an hour later since it's already a rock. I told him it's ok but I was really angry. My husband and got a chicken sandwich. The bread was soft and warm. If you eat bread more often you can tell right the way if the bread is fresh or not. He gave me a bite. The chicken was so hard and chewy that I have so spit it out. If my husband didn't stop me and told me to let it go, don't let it ruin your morning. I would throw the breads in front of their face and said  \"..k\" you. 
A message for the owner: try to eat an old bread to see how do you feel, to see if you can sell it for the customers? Maybe get back to me in this review.  

You are not only lost one customer but all my family and friends. If you guys keep this poor service, you are not going to last long in the  US. I will be watching you."}
{"text":"Their croissants are AMAZING. Everything tasted fresh, all the bread was clearly made in house. It's unique, fast and inexpensive. We stopped in on a whim and were so pleasantly surprised. Absolutely will be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches, but the only downside is it's cash only. I understand the concept of keeping prices low for the customer, but come on its 2015 and I know I rarely have cash on me."}
{"text":"I have given Lee's many chances, and far too many disappointments have come my way. I think that I have particularly high standards for them because they are soo much better in California. Their sandwiches are usually sloppy with a lack of/ skimp amount of necessary ingredients such as pate and picked daikon and carrots. Their bobas are inconsistent and not always as soft and plump as they should be, but rather shribbled with a hard center and dripping with boba water residue in my slushes and teas. The slushes are watered down and flavorless. I have taken my out of town friends here to try, and was embarrassed in doing so. I should've known when I tried to order in Vietnamese, not one person understood me because there were no vietnamese workers there. This really doesn't matter to me, but I can certainly see why the sandwiches are not up to par with my cravings for authenticity. I'd rather go to hue thai for the best sandwiches."}
{"text":"We came across this location by accident, and were starving, so some quick Bahn Mis were the ticket. Ordered some grilled pork sandwiches with boba drinks. Bahn Mi sandwiches aren't known to be large, but these were pretty lightly filled. The bread was the typical Lee's, freshly baked and soft. The drinks were good. Service was slow, which surprised me, considering how empty it was. Seating is plentiful."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  I've come here multiple times and the last 3 times, they kept me waiting for longer than reasonable.  

Once was bc they didn't get our order properly made, second time took 25 minutes with only 4 other customers in the store...not sure why that's considered busy...and this last time, they had no idea what macaron flavors they had.  They kept us waiting 20 minutes after payment to say they didn't have 2/3 flavors we ordered and wasn't sure what other flavors they had (why don't you write this down?)...They also handed us cold manjo even though I asked for fresh warm ones and the guy said he'll take care of us....crap shoot of a Lee's.  I wish I could have taken the tip we gave them in the tip jars all these visits back.  Also when I asked for a refund on the macarons, they gave us back the pre-tax refund.  Wasn't worth it to ask for the tax and have to wait again, so we didn't bother.  Bottom line: this Lee's sucks.

Btw only one of the entrance doors actually opens.  Not sure why.  Would not recommend this location."}
