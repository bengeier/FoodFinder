{"text":"The owner is kind gentleman and his food is good. My only issue with the place is price consistency. Every time I've been it's like $1 extra for this, 50 cents for that... and then at then he plugs all these values into the register and BAM! I just don't get it, and as I customer I don't appreciate it. I will gladly pay whatever is owed, but I feel like the owner is playing games... not cool. And for those of you who are asking about a detailed receipt... forget about it... it's just a final total."}
{"text":"Being in the Burbs of T-Dot I had very few vegetarian options besides an ample amount of Indian food establishments. I was on my way to work in the evening around 9:30pm and saw a sign; Vita Pita. It sounded interesting and like something that I could eat while safely driving.  I went in and first thing I saw was a huge platter of  baklava on display. The owner noticed me gawking and asked if I wanted a platter. I said no thanks and he began asking about my job noticing my uniform. We began having a great conversation as if I were a regular customer. I told him I was from Chicago and he automatically said \" Way To Go Obama!\" as he raised his hand to give me a Hi 5.   This conversation went on for another 3 minutes, in the process he found out that I was a vegetarian. That's when he offered the vegetarian pita wrap which was damn good especially with the extra spicey sauce he added.  The only reason that I gave Vita Pita 4 and not 5 stars is because I didn't know that there were lentils in the veggie wrap; I'm allergic to lentils and had a hive outbreak on my arms while at work.   Yes, I know,  it's not really their fault...   I will definitely check them out again next time I am up that way."}
{"text":"Shawn B who reviewed this below nailed it.  The guy who runs it appears to be nice enough, but he really nickels and dimes you like you wouldn't believe.  The prices were way too high and portions rather tiny for the price, I was always surprised at how little actual chicken and food there was to the entire takeout dinner plate.  You can get *alot* more for less money anywhere else in the city.  I think he's a nice fellow but I stopped going for literally the exact same reason as Shawn B."}
