{"text":"If you're not korean, I believe they will service you slower. 

The first time I went there, my boyfriend and I waited for our food for almost an hour. We kept on reminding them but they served other people who came after us instead so, we left without eating. :(

The second time, they were also slow and we realized that they didn't understand english as much either. There is a definitely a language barrier. At least they have kpop songs and music videos on their tv if you're into that? :D"}
{"text":"Ah yes another Korean Soju bar in Toronto. Here you'll find alot of 1st gen Koreans with nothing better to do. Ample seating so if Turbo can't host you then this place is your next best bet. The waitresses are really friendly and the food is decent. Too bad theres no such thing as booking or K-clubs in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Kokuryo, the name of a Dynasty that was the biggest and strongest of all ancient Korea, that conquered a land roughly the size of modern China. 
But I'm talking about Kokuryo the bar at Yonge & Sheppard, which makes just about as much sense as renaming the Mr. Greek restaurant by the corner to 'Caesar's Palace'.

I've been here a total of three times. 
First there was the big drinking party in the basement of the bar, then there was that second time..which the details of said event escapes me..
Finally, the third time, and my first dining experience here on a late Friday afternoon. I was greeted by the cute waitress (I should mention, this place had always had very attractive service girls) who spend a whole ten seconds contemplating where to sit us in her completely empty restaurant.
It was the first time I've been here during the daytime, and only without the neon lights did I realize how run down this place was. I get that they were going for a Victorian era allure here, but even back then they had sanitary standards. 
You have a section of making your own combination..that being one main entrée, a side dish, and either a load of beers, or one soju. The menu was outrageously expensive for the food that's offered. It took a very long time for me and my whitewashed Korean friend to figure something out. 
I got the chilli shrimp fried rice, he had the kimchi fried rice, and the chicken stew as the main course. I specifically requested that the meals be served all at the same time. This turned out to be too much to ask for.

It was just the two of us here, the chicken stew took forty-five minutes to arrive. We were given fair warning that it would be forty minutes..but seriously, what if the entire establishment ordered that dish? We'd be here til' harvesting season.
All three times I've come here, the basement washroom had been completely filthy. Puke on the urinals, toilet a horrendous mess, I was afraid to wash my hands. If you're a heavy set fellow, forget about the washroom altogether, it was literally designed for thin Asian people only. This was the last place I wanted intimacy to be found.

The Chicken finally came, and immediately my friend and I froze. That smell, we knew that smell from a mile away, it was unmistakable. They had prepared our chicken with....RAMEN POWDER!!!!
Shin Ramen..the popular Korean spicy instant noodle seasoning, and they used that to make our TWENTY DOLLAR chicken stew....
We were about to knock someone out....
How could they have done this?! 
Sixty dollars for two fried rice, and packaged noodle chicken..
MAY GOD STRIKE THIS PLACE TO THE GROUND!!!


And this place doesn't have Redbull....ARGH"}
{"text":"Come here with a Korean friend or you might feel like the only non Korean there. Lights change color in the seating area and there is your typical kpop on the tvs. Get the 5 beer and entrée deal... Especially the spicy chicken or Okonomiyaki because both were amazing. Bathrooms were pretty gross though so it loses a star for that. I like this place better than Turbo but again they really need to clean the bathrooms, add tp, fix the toilet cover and put a female sign on the ladies bathroom. And maybe take down their Christmas tree, it's March!"}
{"text":"Apparently they use to have a deal where it was 5 beers AND an entree for about $20.. now they upped the price to about $30.  But c'mon - 5 beers AND an entree?  You can do no wrong.  Soju's a bit on the expensive side though.  

Spicy chicken is good.  However, don't get the poutine (don't ask me why my friend decided to get the poutine).  You're served a lot of food, so I can't complain. 

Lots of seating as well comparatively speaking to other Korean bars down the street.  

Good place to hang out with some friends on a Friday evening."}
