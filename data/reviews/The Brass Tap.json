{"text":"Great selection of beer, but overpriced, poor food selection, and unhelpful staff will keep us from going back. The bar staff was either not knowledgeable or just pushing the highest markup because I asked for the best IPA and he went straight for Sierra Nevada, which is probably the WORST IPA in the house.  When asked about the menu, he steered us to the prime rib nachos which was just a bunch of potato chips topped with Velveeta cheese, red peppers and a small amount of meat.  The Nachos were way overpriced at $12 and pints were $7.  Our tab for two  totaled $70 and we felt completely ripped off.  In addition, when you sit at the bar, the TVs are too high and you have to tilt your head back in an uncomfortable position to watch.  It's too bad because we love IPA and they had a great selection, but there were too many issues for us to make this our new watering hole."}
{"text":"We had a group of 17 here on Saturday and it was a lot of fun. The owner, manager and the service staff were awesome. I would highly recommend Brass Tap for groups. The food was great and their beer list is fantastic. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Beer selection and service was wonderful!   My only complaint was the food.  Overpriced.  Prime rib nachos were awful; so salty we found them painful to eat, especially at 12.00.  Flatbread were passable but bland.  Pretzels bites were pretzel bites but cheese alongside them was cold; 8.50 for heated up bread is a little obnoxious.  If they aren't going to really 'do' food then they shouldn't charge you as though they are.  Would go again strictly for the beer and friendly service though!!"}
{"text":"Love great IPA!!
Huge selection of craft beer both in draft and bottles. I had very tasty 'crazy bitch double IPA' from Northern brewing co. And figured they named it after me...
I like the intimate set up of the place. We will be repeaters for sure!"}
{"text":"I met the owner? Jason I think.  He was outside having a smoke and I was leaving the BoyScout store with my son.  I approached him and asked if he had any IPA's and he told me about a few of his beers.  This guy was really nice and took the time to say goodbye to patrons that were exiting and to people arriving.  He seems like a really sincere guy.  I hope people visit this place because good people need all the help they can get when the take a risk and start up a new business. That is \"Merica\" baby.  Way to go.  I will visit this place this Friday and have a few cold ones.  Just thought I should share the fact that the owner is quite nice which is a rarity these days."}
{"text":"After moving a mile away from this bar I wanted so bad to like it.  I have been there a half dozen times, the good thing about the place is the craft beer selection, the bad thing is the wait staff and food.  Half the time I went I had to go to the bar to ask for a waitress and the times I ordered food it wasnt much better than microwave food.  The last time I went to Brass Tap I got a growler filled and was charged double the price. I asked our waitress about the pricing and she told me the price was correct.  I later got in touch with the owner who found out his manger made a mistake and charged me double, his solution to the problem was for me to email him and he would respond with a free growler (basically I prepaid for a growler), I have still yet to have the owner respond to my email.  Overall the only reason I would suggest going is if you are already at Riverview, want a good beer on draft, and dont want to drive to one of the many other good local beer bars and breweries in the area."}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying The Brass Tap. Sadly, we were disappointed. Kitchen was backed up and the food was no where worth the wait. The buffalo chicken dip looked like Craft Singles melted down with a little hot sause on top. Tacos were edible, but nothing special. Even my diet coke was flat."}
{"text":"Loved my night here. 300 tap beer's helpful waitress. Went on Star Wars day really cool they were playing the Star Wars movies on the TVs and themed the beers with  Star Wars names. I had a orange cider we also had a great Imperial Stout food looked good but we had dinner plan's so we didn't have any I will be coming back here for sure. Thanks to my son in law from out of town who found this great bar and took us here. Cheers."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the Brass Tap and it was awesome. Soooooo many beers to choose from. The place was packed for their 1 year anniversary it was great to see so many people enjoying great beers and some really good music from Mr. MAL. The service was great the bartenders were very attentive and knew their beers. The beer selection is awe-inspiring. The hardest thing about being at the Brass Tap is deciding which beers to drink. Can't wait to go back and try some more killer beers."}
{"text":"Not crazy about this place after our first time in. Atmosphere is nice, food, which took very long to get for a salad and personal pizza-not great.  Staff apologized several times for the delay. On the positive side, staff was nice and pleasant enough. Beer selection is awesome. So, end result is my husband and I will not be back."}
{"text":"What an amazing place! Hands down one of the friendliest places I've been in awhile! Great staff, AMAZING beer, great prices, BEER CLUB ANYONE SHOULD JOIN, and KNOWLEDGEABLE staff for beer... I won't be shy at all recommending this place to friends or anyone I come across looking for great taps!"}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly and the food and beer selection is stellar.  I've never had a bad time there and the music is always diverse.  I would recommend this to my friends and look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, positively awful bartender!  \"Joe\" was surly from the get go...like it was  an effort to serve us.  The bar was not busy at all, but \"Joe\" stood at the opposite end of the bar and seemed reluctant to come by to check on drinks or offer suggestions for the many beers on the menu.  There are ample choices for bars with good beer choices,,,,,why be subjected to this kind of treatment?  We will not be back...."}
{"text":"The Brass Tap is by far my favorite place to grab a beer. The brew crew program is great, it really encourages you to explore the expansive collection the the brass tap offers, in addition to the constantly rotating taps. The staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  It's nice to go into a beer bar and talk to someone who actually knows about beers instead of making stuff up in hopes I buy it. It's has an atmosphere of fun but at the same time a great place to sit and relax. Truly a great bar with great people....what's not to like."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices.  We had delicious fish tacos and veggie wraps.  Hope to try the rest of the menu next trip to Mesa.  There is a huge beer menu but also wines and cocktails.  We were served quickly and caught up on football.  This restaurant is owned by a proud Navy vet - huge bonus!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My friends and I go all the time, and they always take care of us. The beer selection is VAST, to say the least, and constantly changing. I won't say the food is incredible, because it's a dang tap house and not a gourmet restaurant, but it's totally tasty for a side to my brews. I'm just thrilled they even serve food at all with how many great beers (and wines) they have! Definitely try it out if you're in the area. As long as you're nice to the staff, they'll return the favor ten fold."}
{"text":"Great Beer, but food is terrible.  We ordered the prime rib nachos which were a joke.  They cost $12.  The portion and quality were awful.  The texture of the cheese was equivalent to government cheese.  It had a plastic taste."}
{"text":"Amazing little place! My boyfriend and I have been looking for a neighborhood place that wasn't too busy, but still had a good crowd with good people. This has become our place! The selection is great, the Brew Crew benefits are awesome, and the staff is amazing. Rachel is by far the sweetest person I've ever met, and every suggestion she's ever given me has been a winner. I would recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Worth going the staffs very helpful love this local Mesa bar!"}
{"text":"the place in mesa az for an insane collection of craft beer.  haven't been here yet? you should!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of beer. 60 on tap. And 297 in bottle or cans. Absolutely stunning diversity of styles and breweries."}
{"text":"Great tap list.  So many IPAs and a plethora of drafts and bottles.  Food is average but Ashley and service were great."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by around 7:30 on 08.24.16. I ordered a flight. I was charged $15 for the flight and told by the bartender (as the waitress seemed unsure) \"that's a good deal, it was $25 last week.\" The overhead menu clearly states a flight is $10. We come in once a week, sometimes more and had never seen these employees. The practice of pulling prices out of the air is bad for business. I now question whether we should go back. As there is not likely a single pint in the house that cost $15 (or $25!) we were clearly taken advantage of."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing and the place itself is great! The food however is borderline frozen meal quality. Tastes like I made it while being consumed by drunken munchies in my kitchen at 3am. Bottom line, don't go for the food and you'll be very happy!"}
{"text":"Food was flavorless and boring.  Waiter forgot to put in my sandwich order so I waited an unusually long time for a disappointing sandwich.  Served with the sandwich was a bunch of potato chip pieces ... Not quite crumbs, but almost.  Beer was tasty ... I would t go back for the food."}
{"text":"Holy Cow Amazing Place, perfect place to meet the boys to drinks some beers and watch a game. Family owned and operated and just good good people... can't not wait for them to open in DT Gilbert. Check Em Out!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Lots of great beers good food, and friendly knowledgeable staff. Nothing like a nice cold pint and a pepperoni pappadew pizza after a long crazy Monday."}
{"text":"Food is much better.  As always an excellent beer selection.  Had the prime rib nachos.....they were pretty good. I suggest giving this place a shot.  Mmmmmmm beer!"}
{"text":"The Brass Tap just opened in Mesa Riverview right across from the theatre. They have 60 beers on tap and countless others by the bottle. The focus is American beers, but they have enough variety to satisfy even the avid beer snob. 
I ordered the ham and cheese panini which comes with some amazing tangy honey mustard sauce that I would have bought by the bottle if it was possible. The bread was more like sandwich bread than a traditional panini...but really who cares. It tasted great, and this place is about the beer not the food. 
The bartender was friendly and helpful, even as she politely fielded some drunk dudes hitting on her. 
They have discount nights for first responders (mon), teachers (fri), restaurant workers (sun), and others. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We joined the Brass Tap for Beer and Bacon night as part of Arizona Beer Week.  Food was awesome, beer was awesome, the event was fabulous, and Liz was the best!  Jason and his dad made us feel like family and Liz, who was brand new, redefined customer service!  We enjoyed the prime rib nachos and the wonderful atmosphere!  Only thing I would recommend is to close the overhead door between the outside smoking section and the inside non-smoking area to keep the smoke from wafting in.  Otherwise, this is our new favorite hangout!"}
{"text":"Amazing selection and very good service."}
{"text":"I want to like this place and I still see the potential, however, this place falls flat. The beer selection is exceptional and I haven't found a place with such a varied selection as they have. The environment is great and they have a good amount of TV'S showing different sports channels. 

The big thing that lacks here is the service. The first time my friend and I got there it took awhile for us to get service; with it being a small bar it's very noticeable when new customers come in so waiting for service for over 5 minutes shouldn't happen. Compared to other bars I've been to wait staff is quick to greet even if they're busy and will say they'll be with us in a sec, here you get silence and stares. When the waitress finally came over you could tell she didn't want to be there and had an agitated demeanor. I can kind of understand if we went in 30 minutes prior to closing but we got there at 8pm on a Thursday. Another couple came in soon after and experienced the same wait but they decided to leave. The beer was great and our company was good so the first experience didn't put a damper on us that night so we didn't totally write off this place.

Second return here we experienced the same \"stellar\" customer service. This time we came in on a Friday night at 11, there were maybe three groups along with people seated at the bar. It wasn't packed but there were a good amount of people. We sat at a table right in front of the bar and waited. My friend excused herself to the restroom so I got her order in case the waitress came, my friend returned and I was still not greeted or acknowledged. I decide to go to the restroom and when I came back out the waitress was just leaving the table; waiting 5 minutes for service seems like a regular thing here. Once I got situated my friend told me the girl was cleaning off the table next to her and she had to ask her if she was getting service or not. So once we finished our drinks we cashed out and left. 

If they ever get better staff then perhaps I'll try this place again. There's nothing worse than trying to support local places only to experience bad service."}
{"text":"The selection of beers is great. The location may not be the best but it is always a good crowd and bartenders are very friendly. It has a family atmosphere that my wife and i really enjoy. I have been there when live music was on and the singer was great and not too loud. Happy hour selection is also great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ashley is awesome! Great atmosphere, lots of beers on draft. Nacos are excellent!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to check out the neighborhood as we are moving to this area soon. Service was wonderful, bar was packed, and both food and drink were delicious! We'll have to add this place to the list to bring friends and family later on. I love the selection of beer and they have pretzels and beer cheese, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome!! The food S.U.C.K.S!!!! Tasted like the smell of burning plastic... Like I'm going to filibertos for a bean and cheese burro because I ate zero food  worth the visit for the beer and that's it."}
{"text":"If you enjoy beer, this is the place. Great selection of tasty beers. Little disappointed in the regular nachos we ordered. We got a lot of the broken little chips from the bottom of the bag. Service was good and everyone seemed friendly. Certainly will return for another get together. We got there late but my friends said the other appetizers they ordered were good."}
{"text":"Has potential, but not there yet.  (based on THREE visits so far)

    As everyone has mentioned, the beer selection is amazing!  And it is.  Lots and lots of great beers, both foreign and domestic and both local and nationwide.  That great IPA in your fridge right now, they probably have it in bottles, maybe even on tap.  You cannot beat the beer selection.

    On the downside, however, you can beat the price.  My buddy had two IPA's (on tap):
    1) one was $9 and one was $8!
    2) both were served in the appropriate (but smaller) 10oz tulip glass.
    3) neither were full due to the 1/2+ inch of foamy head.
    so you get about 9oz of a fantastic beer, but at a cost of up to $1 per ounce.  

    My beers were $5 (pint glass) and $6 (tulip glass).  Both were great, but the above issues still applied.

    But wait, those prices don't include tax!  

    So when you get the bill, sales tax is added to it.  This is bad for two reasons:
    1) typically bar prices include tax so that the bartender doesn't have to make ridiculous change (e.g. everything ends in .00 or .50), but not here.  So the bartender has to maintain a full drawer to provide the proper change!?!?!
    2) this means the beer is even more expensive.  That $8 beer is actually $8.64 and that $9 beer is actually nearly $10.
    so billing in this fashion shafts the employees and the customers (and probably makes for worse tips too, but I'm only speculating).

    Did I mention the beer selection is fantastic?

    So they have this fantastic beer menu (a book really) but all of the staff tell you NOT to use it because it is not complete or accurate (and I noticed there are numerous spelling mistakes and typos, but that is improving).  So to see what they have on tap, you have to go read the huge chalkboard across from the bar (or use the app).  Great menu, but no one recommends it! lol

    I haven't tasted the food, so I cannot comment, though I did not notice any typos on the food menu.  I thought the food menu was somewhat pretentious, but viable if the Brass Tap is a destination that people go out of their way for, as it is not typical bar food.  

    So I think the Brass Tap has potential, once they get the kinks worked out and adopt a more reasonable pricing schedule.  This is a neighborhood bar for me, so it has to find a happy medium as far as cost.  I don't mind paying a premium for a good beer, but I'm going to buy it at Beer World for my fridge if it feels like I'm overpaying for it when I go out to the Brass Tap.

YELP apparently does not trust my review, tho others have expressed the same sentiment.

In short,

THIS PLACE IS TOO EXPENSIVE, AND THEY CHARGE TAX ON TOP OF THAT.

$10 FOR A FLIGHT.  SORRY, NOT DOING IT ANYMORE.

Update 12.10.15: apparently they don't read their Yelp reviews either. Because none of the issues mentioned have been addressed."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I sat there for 15 minutes with out any sort of acknowledgement. How can you ignore customers for 15 minutes?! I ended up leaving unhappy and un satisfied."}
{"text":"Looks nice, seemed clean, but what good is a bartender/server that won't say hello or even acknowledge you when you're sitting 10ft from them and they aren't busy?  After waiting and waiting we walked out.  The entire time, nobody said a word to us on the way in or out."}
{"text":"The Brass Tap absolutely has the worst service I have seen in a long time.  Very sad we have never been here before and will never ever suggest this place to anyone ever again."}
{"text":"This place is 'good'. I really enjoyed the location, the atmosphere, the people, the beer! Good stuff! The only issue is we walk away from this place every time feeling like we spent more than what we enjoyed. They push a chain on you and they make us try to buy in without any real appeal. Beer is the drink of the middle class! Why do I have to visit and spend like a royal? SRSLY."}
{"text":"....had not been to Mesa Riverview drinking before, but after a quick one and done date across the plaza I wandered into the Tap to grab a $3 football special beer and watch some football. The TV situation is nice with plenty of screens right above bar and they had a number of beers for three bucks on special, but no food deals. It was also $1.50 off AZ beers during Happy Hour, so good timing. I still prefer not to give a credit card for the tab if the bar is not crowded, but each place is different. They did have literally a hundred brews to choose from, but I nabbed a local brew and it seemed like a greta place to watch sports and sit on patio. I liked the futuristic sanitizing system that gives the glasses an extra wash and an extra cold temperature for serving."}
{"text":"Sooo the beer is great but I had one of the girls with pink hair made me very  embarrassed  when she yelled out across the restaurant  that I had shorted her 13 cents. I went back and paid and was very apologetic and I said wow 15 dollars for a 4 dollar beer and a seven dollar flight did not add up. Well her response was that the taxes in mesa are high, well upon walking out my brother asked to see the receipt and he noticed that she had actually over charged me 2.13 cents the workers here need to be more attentive to the bills they are sending out and people need to look at their bill closely before paying to make sure they are not paying extra wether its a few cents or a few dollars it is not right"}
{"text":"Great place for bar fare and great craft selection. Bartenders very nice and know their beers, the loyalty club is pretty cool as well... If you are in the area I suggest you give it a shot"}
{"text":"I've been to The Brass Tap multiple times and really enjoy the place; the food's overpriced, but the outstanding beer selection more than makes up for that. It's small and normally pretty quite, which makes it the perfect place for a few pints and a conversation with friends.

With that in mind, I'm SO glad last night wasn't my first experience with The Brass Tap, or I'd never come back. We met with some friends for Team Trivia and experienced the worst service possible. The place was packed and it appeared that they only had one bartender and one waitress to handle the crowd, which meant that people on our team were consistently being ignored, and even when our waitress (Rachel, according to the bill) actually took beer orders, she only took them for part of the table, walked away without hearing what people were asking for, and came back without beers that people had ordered. Even after the place cleared out when trivia was done, we continued to receive the same terrible service. ! Rather than offering a pre-emptive apology about whatever was going to take so long for us to get our beers/waters/bill/etc, we were offered three different and conflicting excuses after waiting for extended periods of time. We all ended up waiting around an hour just to get our bills, and there were only three tables! The bartender did come out and give us all coupons for BOGO pints, and even though they expire in three days, it was a nice gesture. It's fine if you're short-staffed and surprisingly busy, but you should know how to appease the customers you have while they wait rather than ignoring them and forgetting their orders."}
{"text":"These guys need to figure out some customer service. We went in and sat there for a while and then left. The bartenders look creepy anyway. Go somewhere else this place sucks. Beer is beer and the atmosphere and service here is thumbs down."}
{"text":"Horrible wait staff, mediocre food. Beer is good. No server attending us right away,  when she came by took forever to get her to come back when their were barely anyone in the place. Slow on refills for soda."}
{"text":"Come for the beer, not the food. So many drinks to choose from, and there's something for everyone. I am not a huge beer drinker but they had plenty of fruity beers (Peach, Orange Blossom, etc.) and several different types and flavors of cider. A few in our party ordered food- nothing special. Everything comes out on disposable plastic plates/bowls. Even the chips tasted stale. 
Service was good! My sister had made a reservation and there seemed to be a little mix up when she arrived so they offered us 10% off of our bill for the inconvenience. Before the rest of our party arrived, one of the owners even sat and chatted with her for a few minutes. How often does that happen!? 
Definitely come check out their beer menu! Nice to have some many options and try something new. Maybe eat at home before you stop in."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection.  We ordered the margarita pizza and the pretzel bites with cheese.  The food wasn't that great, but the beer was yummy."}
{"text":"Brass Tap is an awesome little spot to check out for a pretty eclectic and wide variety of beers. It's got a casual atmosphere and a bartender who is literally a beer aficionado! He literally could answer every question I had & made excellent recommendations. They even have games like Connect 4 & Sorry to keep you entertained during their totally worth it happy hour. They've got some trivia night and other entertainment and are within a short distance to the Cubs training facility. Definitely a place you can go to repeatedly and never tire of the selection."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for good beer.  I really like that they rotate their beer all the time.  The have many screens and every game you can imagine.   Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I'm a little disappointed. Came in on a Sunday so the bartender talked me into a pizza and beer combo for $10. Then he charged me full price. I caught it, he apologized and fixed it. No big deal. But then I go to the bathroom before I leave and left another swig of beer to finish when I got done. When I came out of the bathroom, he had cleared my glass with beer in it and told me \"have a good one!\" Dude... Come on dude... 

Oh the pizza was pretty tasty. So was the beer...well, at least what I drank before...dude."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last 2 years, finally getting around to writing a review. They say reviews are only posted upon a bad experience however this is quite the opposite. Despite having 60+ beers and a knowledgeable staff, I can definitely call this bar Home. Ashley L consistently provides a warm atmosphere at the bar, and one of my favorite nights to come is Trivia Monday's. One of the best craft beer bars around I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Review #400! Woo hoo! 

I really hate giving this place 1 star, but it deserves it. I came here after finishing the Phoenix Marathon, so there were a good bit of runners here. The only redeeming quality about this place is the beer selection. Although vast in number, the draft selection wasn't the most diverse or eclectic. 

The service was pretty awful. Apparently, this place gets crowded on a regular basis, yet they only have three people working the floor for the entire place. That's absolutely ridiculous. We had to wait forever to get a server and order our beer. I ordered a can of Founders All Day IPA, which was $3. The server brought me the beer in a glass, so I just assumed they poured the beer from the can into the glass. Turns out the girl got me the draft beer, which was twice the price at $6. When we cashed out, I brought this to the attention of the server. She spoke with her manager, and he said that since I drank the 16oz beer, I got 4 extra ounces, so he couldn't change the price for me. It wasn't my fault that the girl brought me the wrong beers, yet you can't adjust my bill? 

We ordered some food as well. Another disaster. Somehow, our order for lost, so we sat around for about an hour and a half until our food came out. They didn't comp our food, which they absolutely should have done, but they gave us 20% off. 

Horrible customer service here, where the customer is treated as the enemy. I will never come back."}
{"text":"Do not come to watch a football game on a Sunday afternoon. Came in to watch the Cardinals play. The female bartender refused to change the station to the game because the only person who could change the stations was in the back cooking. So 25 minutes into the game the person who could change the stations finally came out and changes it to the game."}
{"text":"Lots a different beer.  Sample sold and good explanations for each.  The food was ok but not as good as it could be for the price."}
{"text":"Stopped by because I had a meeting scheduled here. Not being a beer drinker, had never heard of this place. Environment was cool and beer selection looked amazing (says the non beer drinker). The service was pretty consistent considering we were talking business for a couple hours. 
Eventually two of us decided we were hungry. One person had salad rolls and I ordered a protein quinoa chicken bowl with a poblano sauce. My friend said her food was disappointing and she wouldn't get it again. My salad was good, the chicken was tasty and I loved the poblano sauce, although the quinoa was so minimal that I didn't even realize there was any in there. Definitely overpriced for the size of the salad too. The person who chose the place belated mentioned the food wasn't very good. 

To sum it up, come for the beer and atmosphere. If you're looking for a good lunch or dinner, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was in Mesa for the night staying at the Sheraton. I took a walk over here cause the girl that checked me in said it's where she goes. This place has a great beer selection. If you are looking for a drink I would definitely recommend this place. They have above par bar food. Nothing spectacular but not bad either. The staff is very friendly and easy to deal with. They get busy and could probably use more staff during the rush."}
{"text":"As a place with a selection of craft beers they get 4 stars.  The food was fresh and good. Prices are reasonable with the chicken and bacon wrap at $ 8.99. Not a great price , but, typical for the area. Menu is simplistic with a small selection of pizzas, sandwiches and apps. Service was great and friendly. They only have beer and wine. Being a rum drinker I had to resort to beer.  I had a Nitro Stout which was excellent.  
Overall it was a very nice establishment, cozy, welcoming, well appointed and if your a beer lover a great place to sample was very good brews. If you live in the area this could be your local hang out."}
{"text":"Fun pub crawl feel. Excellent beer selections, decent ciders and some wines as well. The pizzas are also quite good. A fun relaxed place to bring a date or friends and relax."}
{"text":"Brass Tap you are getting 2 stars because you have a great beer selection and knowledgeable bartenders. When I arrived on a busy Sat night you had one bartender trying to serve the bar and the servers. Needless to say I sat at the bar for about 10 minutes before another bartender came onboard. What I found \"amusing\" a server saw the lone bartender in the weeds and brought in a reinforcement. Amusing? Yes someone who I gathered was the manager was just standing at the end of the bar watching this unfold. He did show some leadership qualities by ordering a round of Comped shots for his buddies. 

Yea I'll be back and will update as the beer selection is wonderful."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Awesome beer. Awesome service. Need I say more? Go there and see for yourself! Local bar vibes with drafts from EVERYWHERE!"}
{"text":"Great Place. I was reluctant to try this place for some reason, I guess I thought it would be like a big chain place...it is not. Great atmosphere , smaller than I thought it would be, which is good. insane selection of tap beers, bottled beers and cans. Need some more variety though, no cream ale's and just a few Hefeweizen's and tons of IPA's, everybody is all about IPA's now.
I'll be back, Five Stars."}
{"text":"I feel bad for the bartender. I showed up with a group of six people and it completely slammed him. He stated the cook wasn't going to arrive until later so we had to pretty much drink for an hour and a half before we able to get any food. The bartender was a nice enough guy but it just seem like the ownership or management was really supporting having customers at this place. ThIs the second time I came here and dealt with the same lack of service or attention. Great location great selection of beer but falls way short in the customer service area. Too bad, we chose trying to support a Mesa business rather than going over the freeway to the Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"This place kicks ass! We stopped in on our way out of town and just planned on seeing what it was like... we ended up staying for 2 hours and had an absolute blast. They had an amazing beer selection, but the food was a huge surprise, it was great! The service was really good too. All the staff that I dealt with were incredibly nice and helpful. I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great drink selections, even for the non traditional beer drinker. Always fun atmosphere & pretty good food."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of the wonderful tap and bottle lists here. The beer selection is very impressive, which makes me a happy girl!
Seriously, I can't say it enough... great selection!
I didn't order any food since I am the rare weirdo who doesn't usually eat when I just want a pint or two. I'm prefer to nibble on something salty/crunchy so I have room for more beer. Maybe in the future when I stop in to Riverview for a movie I may stop in for a pint and a nibble. 
The place is a bit small and seating feels a little awkward.
Staff isn't overly friendly, but they are pleasant enough.
I'll definitely be back to enjoy that tap list, most likely during happy hour!"}
{"text":"What can I say?  This place is great!  I go there frequently and I always find something new to enjoy.  There are plenty of TV's to catch all of the games, the vibe is chill, and the staff is great!  

60 taps on hand and it seems like they tap something new every day.  The bottles they have are endless and they've incorporated some great deals.  Live music is always pretty good, and the place is really clean all of the time (I can't stand an establishment that doesn't take pride in its appearance.)  

They take care of their taps and the beer doesn't have far to travel.  All glasses are essentially room temperature, so the flavor of the beer doesn't get ruined.  

All in all, I'd have to say these folks are doing beer right.  Every bartender I've talked to has way more knowledge about the beer than I do and they're exceptional when it comes to making recommendations for the styles I like.  

Although not an extensive menu, the food they do have is pretty good.  That pretzel crust pizza is pretty awesome but my favorite is the prime rib sandwich.  

I love the fact that it's a laid back environment where it seems everyone just wants to come in and enjoy some beer.  I recommend visiting here frequently, mainly because they go through beers relatively quickly so you never know what you might find.  

Great daily specials, happy hour, events, etc.  What can I say?  This has quickly and easily become my new favorite watering hole."}
{"text":"A great little place that serves... BEER. For someone like me new to the craft beer world, its a blast reading and trying new beer! Our first visit I went with a few I knew like the sonoran white chocolate ale, and wells banana bread beer (bottle) and have to say, the group of 4 we had all LOVED the food. I had a panini and really enjoyed it. Pretzel bites with the cheese were perfect! We live in mesa but make it a point to come here! Is it Friday yet?"}
{"text":"Seemed like a good spot while waiting for a movie/friends. The beer selection was good! Ambiance was good. Food was not that great. I'd give it another try for sure though... could be HH food isn't a good measuring stick here."}
{"text":"Solid beer selection on tap here. We came here late on a Saturday night so most of the kitchen was closed. We were able to get the spinach dip which was good but nothing amazing. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"They have a very large selection of beers, but I thought everything (food included) was a little overpriced. I'd recommend the Pistachio-Yo if it's available and the chicken buffalo dip, add bacon, for a light snack. The bartenders all work together so it's basically grab who you can when they walk by. I prefer a more one-on-one approach, but it must work for them. Nice selection of cigars with a small patio and ample parking out front. Definitely snag a booth because their tables are awkwardly small rectangles which don't leave much room."}
{"text":"We were excited for this place to open and we left pretty impressed, especially since they just opened. 

Pros - Beer selection is what you come here for - period. They let us try anything, which was amazing. All the other tap rooms usually charge for tastes. The food menu is limited, but the prime rib sandwich at the pretzels were both good. The pizza, with pretzel crust, was so-so. Wait staff was delightful, owner was nice. We sat outside which was lovely. 

Cons - The inside is mostly high tables. I prefer low. It is also on the small side, so I would be worried to try to meet here with a large group. 

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal beer selection, the atmosphere is very pub like, and the staff was helpful. The menu is limited, and we had the pretzel, nachos, and a panini...overall the food is average at best. The pretzel was about a third raw, the nachos were really just a glob of potato chips and liquid cheese, the panini was good.  I'll be back for beer, but will need to eat before or after."}
{"text":"The brass tap knows it is a bar. Good food.  Exceptional service and even sells cigars."}
{"text":"I observed one of the servers petting two dogs outside on the patio and not washing her hands afterwards.  

One of the female servers was vigorously petting and belly scratching two of the dogs, for an extended period of time, two of three dogs that customers had brought to the restaurant and were hanging out on the patio.  One of the dogs was licking the server's hand and she stayed there and allowed it.  

I then observed the same server come inside, without washing her hands, and grabbed a wet bar towel and sat at the bar and wiped down a bunch of menus.  After about 5 minutes of this, she walked out to the patio again, with the bar towel in her hands hanging down, and one of the dogs was licking the bar towel.  She did not subsequently wash her hands nor toss the bar towel in the laundry after that incident.

As a restaurant worker, you have an obligation to your customers to keep a clean shop.  Petting dogs, not washing your hands, not tossing the dog hair / dog saliva bar towel and then handling my food or wiping down my menu with dog hair hands is absolutely unacceptable.  

I Love, Love, Love the beer and the food.  I have been here at least 5 times.  

After witnessing this incident with a server petting a dog and not washing her hands IMMEDIATELY, I will not be back.  Ever.  EVER!!!

Sorry, Brass Tap, I am going to miss hanging out here."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times (probably 4) and while they have a wonderful beer selection,(this is the only reason to go here) I can honestly say what little food their kitchen makes is just not good and frankly, overpriced. Half the time the potato chips they give you as your side are stale tasting and they rely heavily on goat cheese to mask any other flavor you might taste in many of their dishes. I LOVE the beers which often change based on the season and  current trend. but short of filling a growler or two, there is no reason to visit, and absolutely no reason to linger. The service is meh. nothing to say about that good or bad."}
{"text":"I thought it was a pretty good place. Lots of different unique beers available. They were out of their house red wine and ran out of chicken (random?!?) so I didn't get to try the chicken panini. The pizza was a little greasy but my fiancé had a prime rib sandwich that was delicious! Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality this place has is their beer selection. We tried the pepperoni pretzel pizza and the prime rib nachos. My husband and I unanimously agreed that both tasted like stadium food (at stadium prices). The pizza was over doughy and made me want to gag. I sent it back. The bartender was very professional and took it back without question. The only reason we didn't send back the nachos is because my husband was over-hungry and needed to eat. I hated the sweet peppers and lukewarm beer cheese on the nachos and would not eat more after the first bite. The prime rib was essentially lunch meat. For $14, I expected much better. IF we were to go back, we'd eat somewhere else first just to enjoy the beer selection."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection if you are willing to spend an arm and a leg for a 16 once beer. The flights are the best deal but they only allow you to choose from certain beers. On average its 10 dollars for a 16 once beer. There are plenty of places that offer a wide selection of beers for a much more reasonable price. I can't speak for the food we juat wanted a couple beers while waiting for our movie but next time I'll probably just go to Chillis and that's saying something because its one of my least favorite places to go."}
{"text":"So I've been here twice, both times prior to a Cubbies spring training game - and I cannot fault them for their amazing beer selection.  Sadly that's where the props end in this review... every single menu item we tried was either cold, under seasoned, or just plain blah... so I can't recommend a single food choice here - but if you're in the area and wanting a beverage this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Their food has always been pretty good and there service is a-okay too. Great beer selection and some fun shots and drinks as well. There are games at the bar that you can grab before you sit and this bar is a nice place to catch a game or just hangout for happy hour. It seems super quiet on Sunday but they also stop serving food at 7p on a Sunday. What? Get a special going on and get folks to come in! I dig their pizza and nachos are good too. Their buffalo chicken dip is a bit meh and tastes like canned chicken but who knows. I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 3 because I want to see this place succeed. Just seems like a little more effort here would get it there! We need a great bar in Mesa Riverview!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Foreigner - I Want To Know What Love Is)

In my life there's been reviews with stars
I'm pretty sure I can eat it again
Can't stop now, I've Bo Bites so far
To give this place a try.......

I wanna go to the Brass Tap
I really want to show you
I wanna go to the Brass Tap
I know I can show you

Nestle inside the heart of Mesa Riverview complex is The Brass Tap.  With over 20 locations nationwide the Mesa location is the first in Arizona.  Lucky us!

The Brass Tap provides a nice, clean, and homey feel to your beer brewery.  A selection of craft brews along with your regular store bought beer available in a bottle or draft. 

I came on a Saturday night with a friend and order several different beers to try out while a solo singer rocked out on the early 90s music.  Pretty awesome and chilling night in my book.  I also ordered their pretzel crusted pizza; yep that's pretty new to me!  Overall, the pretzel dough was original and surprisingly it worked well.  Tad bit over salty for sure, but I guess that helps sell the beer!  In the end, a great atmosphere along with great selection.  The pizza was interesting and something I would recommend to try! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"For such a good selections of beers this place is too quite. Great place to watch a game and enjoy a choice brew. Also, December is Founders month. $4 pints. Get there."}
{"text":"Server was very kind but the food came out slowly and my husband got his way before I got mine. We ordered kettle chips and they looked like they were just potato chips dumped from the bottom of the bag with a little paprika sprinkled on the top. My husband had a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed and I had a flatbread that was oily but tasted okay. Beer selection is very good but food is not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Delicious and pretty quick considering a packed house here, just opened up and on a Saturday early evening! Vibing with the classic rock songs, which is always a plus. Few kids outdoor playing life-size connect 4 but not too many kids around. Lots of full screen TV's around playing your sport of choice and of course a menu of drinks because it's all in the name !"}
{"text":"Must check out!  Unbelievable beer selection and knowledgeable staff. Highly recommend for a drink or several this one is a winner."}
{"text":"Yes they have gluten free beer but don't plan on eating here. There are a couple of items on the menu that look like they could be modified however NOT. So you are left with a wedge salad. I would have given another star or 2 except that I called earlier in the day to check the menu and was told they would be able to accommodate me. Oh well nice atmosphere. Might come back for the live music when I'm not hungry!"}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing selection of beers.  I'm always on the lookout for some good sours, and rarely do I find those in Mesa or Gilbert, but Brass Tap has them.  I've only been there once, but the service was great, and the beer selection was everything that I expect to see in a craft beer bar.  This place is great for people that love trying new beers and are always on the lookout for beers that you don't normally see anywhere else.  Coming from San Diego, which has an eclectic beer scene, I can honestly say that this place is money for beer drinkers.  I haven't had the privilege of trying their food, but the menu seems to be standard, featuring various bar snacks, flat breads, and pizzas.  They also have various board games and trivia nights making for a fun spot to come to with your friends or a date.  Definitely coming back to this place soon!"}
{"text":"Ashley is a fun person and great bartender. Never had an empty beer and was constantly making sure we were doing well. A1 service. 10/10 would come back."}
{"text":"Me and 5 friends were excited for the new location in downtown gilbert to open.  We Ubered it down there so we could hang out and do some drinking.  They have a very large selection of beers so we wanted to do a taster of something that looked good before we committed.  We were told there is a 2 taster limit and then its $2.00 for a sip taster after that.  ?????
I couldn't believe it.  I asked why and they said because some of their beers are expensive.  Why wouldn't you just charge .50 for a taster of the expensive ones.  $2 a sip, are you kidding me.  What brewery does this.  Just that one!  We got up and left and went 20 feet down to champions saloon and dropped about $400 playing pool, darts and ordering appetisers and a lot of tasty drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cool beer, so many options! Definitely recommend this place to stop and grab a cold one on a hot day. Plus there's free wifi"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! So many beers to choose from, especially with their rotating tap. Great service every time I come here! The bartenders are always very knowledgeable and are great at suggesting a beer that suits me! If you're looking for a chill hangout spot with a great variety of beer, then this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Pros:
+ Strong Beer Selection
+ Ayinger Dunkelweiss on tap!

Cons:
...nothing

Would I go back: Yessss

A bar carrying a vast array of beers. Selection is pretty good....and they have a beer from my favorite Munich brewery, Ayinger, on TAP. Awesome. Right next to the Cinemark too. Great spot to stop in before watching a movie."}
{"text":"Met friends here after the first place we went to had a special event going on. The service was friendly. If you cannot find a beer you like here there is a problem, they have quite a large selection of both tapped and bottled/canned. I had a Marzen that all of us agreed was good. The food is so-so. Mostly appetizers. I had a 5 cheese macaroni and cheese which was OK. Whether live or sound system it was loud, we had trouble carrying on conversations. This is a franchised chain, at the moment this is the only on in Arizona but there will be one opening soon in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place is so comfortable. Clean food was served very fast. Several beers on tap. Chicken  salad had a bit of spice which I enjoyed. Service was
Excellent ."}
{"text":"We love stopping in here on our way home from a long bike ride around the canals.  They don't have bike parking very close, so that should change, but we just lock them up to the fence.  The bartenders are always friendly and willing to give us samples.  We love the chips and salsa because the chips always come out hot and the salsa is delicious!  We had the Peri peri chicken sandwich last time we stopped in and it was really good but really spicey so beware!"}
{"text":"It could be that I went here on a slow night (Tuesday) but I wasn't a fan. Good selection of beers though."}
{"text":"The inside of this place is oddly located. There are stools at the bars and then tables that were kind of in the middle of the aisle where people walk a lot. We got a table and I can't believe how many beers they have on tap. They have everything and anything. Not much of a beer drinker, I didn't order anything, but my boyfriend did and price wise wasn't too bad. I had their baked pretzel and their cheese is amazing!!! I give that 5-stars alone. It was delicious! They didn't really have a big food selection either, just a couple of appetizers and sandwiches. A good place to just chill/hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I swung by here to grab some lunch. Ordered a Chicken flatbread and it was the worst one I had ever had. All of the ingredients were simply thrown on a flatbread and seemed like it was just microwaved. Never comin back here again"}
{"text":"An unbelievable selection on beers. Very thorough. 
That being said the food that I had is where the stars were lost. The Mac n chz was interesting. Sweet and spicy. With the all the chz the sweet component was way too much. And DO NOT get the \"prime rib\" on it. Now the \"roast beef \" that I got was tender. A lil bland but tender. 
I'm sure it's a prime rib cut BUT when u over cook it it becomes jus an average roast beef. I should've tried the pizza."}
{"text":"After being there for 20 minutes being ignored we got up and left what crappy service won't be going in there again."}
{"text":"This place is so fun! It was a group of 11 we each ordered different mules I got the Georgia mule it was amazing! The owner Jason I believe let us try the shuffle board for the first time ever so it's safe to say we're ground breakers in that bar! Haha! & Daniel our waiter was just so nice fast & polite we really enjoyed our time here!"}
{"text":"Beer selection is good but food and wait staff is terrible. Highly disappointed. Definitely not going back"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch here today and the food was very good.  We started with an appetizer, buffalo dip and chips.  The chips were authentic fresh made style and the buffalo dip is very good and more than enough for two people.  Ashley had a prime rib sandwich and I  had  the grilled buffalo chicken wrap.  I know I stayed on the buffalo theme for my lunch.  The fries are very good, but maybe a few more for larger appetites would be better.  Service was decent and the manager came out to check on how things were a couple times.  They have a large variety of beer and cider draught and in bottles.  It happened to be that our first two picks for the draught were blown earlier that day, but our second choices were excellent.  We sat outside and realized as the weather gets warmer some additional shade and or misting will need to be added to make daytime outside dinning bearable.  Also as business picked up the service did slowdown.  I'm not sure if this is a schedule issue or staffing because it appeared they had plenty of staff on hand."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I felt so welcomed when I walked through the door. Ian and Jason are awesome, they made the visit 10x better for sure! Ian knows how to explain every beer on tap which is so important when you have no idea what you want. Great beer and food choices too! I will be coming back very soon. Thank you Brass Tap!"}
{"text":"Four stars because the beer selection is great and the service was amazing! Left one star out because the food is not so great. Hummus is definitely premade and the salsa is canned."}
{"text":"Good beer selection. Reasonable prices. Really like the pretzels. Decent happy hour with some money off beers and appetizers"}
{"text":"Chelsea is an amazing server! She had great recommendations, and was really sweet! We will be back for sure!!! Thanks Chelsea! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for food and drinks tonight before my movie and was disappointed.  The food was average for bar food,  my fish tacos were defiantly not beer battered fish fillets but more like mashed up fish goo at the bottom of the tortilla.  I was starving so I ate it anyways. The part that I'm confused about is why I got double charged for my drinks.  My boyfriend originally bought our first round and it didn't register until I just got home that even though he bought our first round she turned around and put them on my tab again! If you are going to charge me twice I would at least appreciate the actual beer...... brass tap that is a fail,  I won't be back."}
{"text":"On paper this place looks great....a local place serving up hundreds of beers. Once you get in there its a different story.


The selection of beers is great. One of the best I have seen in the Valley!!! I

1. The pictures make this place look huge. Really its just a bar with some extra tables and a good amount of TVs

**This place is BAR first and foremost and food definitely comes second...or maybe 3rd or 4th (See below)

2. Service - BAD!!!! The staff seems jaded and not happy to be there. Also we waited entirely too long for our beers and food.

3. FOOD - Maybe the worst I've ever seen at a bar. First there are no Wings on the Menu....this is a bar people....wings should be first!!!. A few dips and a few sandwiches...that's it!!!!

We were a GROUP OF 5 SO WE PRETTY MUCH ORDERED THE WHOLE MENU.... The chips were from a bag from the store. The prime rib tasted frozen at best. The pizza's were a total joke...sloppy with cold centers. 

Not sure what their kitchen capabilities are but they are not good. Either get a CHEF...hell even a lunch lady can make better food then who makes it now.

Also...all food is served on Styrofoam plates....SAD

COST- We walked out of there with a 100+ dollar tab after the groupon. Your money can be better spent elsewhere!!!

This place is in MESA and near Apache junction..... Perhaps that is why it is the way it is but they should really improve or they will FAIL

I will not be Back!"}
{"text":"300 beers?!?!? This is a great place to come if you're looking for plenty of options. The food menu leaves something to be desired because of a lack of options. Good happy hour prices and a number of TV's to watch sports on. Well worth your time."}
{"text":"Pricy for the kind of service .. Food 2 on 10 and plastic plate.. Are you kidding me? Plastic plate with real silverware .. A joke... Their nachos $12 is bad. the male server eating at the bar and serving at the same time. Lucky they did not have a health inspectors visit then. Place is nice but need service improvement and food improvement definitely the food sucks .  Won't be going back... Boston bar on McClintock/ Elliott is better than that"}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent selection of craft beer and great menu to absorb the beer! Live music on the weekends,I give it a 5 I will deff be back!!"}
{"text":"Not recomended before a movie. I've been here before and had an average experience, no complaints. But we went here for our second time 30 minutes before a movie to grab a quick pint. At 9:40PM while entering this place the bar tendered yelled out \" last call was at 10PM\". The place still had a few people drinking at the bar looked like they were friends. We had a way better experience at the chili's across the street. Super friendly and were able to grab our pint before the movie."}
{"text":"Went back to The Brass Tap with my best friend.  This time there was a much bigger crowd and more staff.  We sat outside since this is the best time of year in Arizona.  The service was better and this time I actually got the food I ordered.  It was okay, we split the quesadilla and pretzel bites with beer cheese - typical quality for your average brewery fare.  I ended up making a mess with a fresh beer and a super wobbly table, but the waitress brought us plenty of napkins to mop up the spill.  It's still not my favorite place, they need to tighten the bolts on their tables, but I can say they're better than the one-star review previously given."}
{"text":"The Brass Tap is excellent on the beer front, and \"meh\" when it comes to food. 

Seriously, this is a craft beer oasis of sorts and everyone is sure to find something they'll enjoy whether it's on tap, bottled or canned. 

I ended up here with four other people when the first location we intended to meet at ended up having a special event. 

There was live music which made it difficult to carry on a conversation. This continued even after the band packed up.  

I ordered a Grand Canyon Brewing Company Pumpkin Porter because ... White and basic AF. But clocking in at 8%, aforementioned basic white chicks couldn't handle *this* level of pumpkin spice. ;) 

As for the food, don't show up hungry like we did. We tried a variety of everything, from the short rib four cheese mac and cheese skillet, prime rib nachos and buffalo chicken dip. 

Lots of potential, but really lukewarm and half hearted attempts at pub food. Seriously, everything came out within what seemed like under 10 minutes. 

Our bartenders were friendly and hustled during the craziness that was a Saturday night. 

Recommended only for the beer."}
{"text":"This place had an awesome selection of beer. I would definitely recommend for a great beverage pit stop while shopping. The Caribbean mule was my favorite. I would NOT recommend eating there however. I felt like this place just decided to add a few microwaves in a closet for the kitchen. Not that I mind watching my food be prepared, but seeing the girl prepare my food with out gloves and touch everything in the kitchen without them was highly disturbing. Overall, I would definitely add it to a list places to drink...I just wouldnt eat there."}
{"text":"I'm not one to leaving yelp reviews because a yelp review caused me to lose my job. 

I give this location 2 stars for all the beers they have on tap and in cans which is amazing.

First off, the gentleman who was behind the bar was fine, took him a minute to get to us but he was the only one there and somewhat busy so I won't fault him for that, about a half hour later a chick with pink hair showed in, seemed irritated and just annoyed.... took over the guys place.... not even 30 mins into her shift she's already eating, my friend and I have had a menu in our hands for a while and no one has asked us if we wanted anything. Waited a few more minutes to see if anyone noticed and nope, they took care of other people and asked what they would like to eat.  Also took a while for them to take our second drink order. 

I work in the food industry and never have I ever eaten while 10 mins into my shift.  Let alone ignored people. 

Won't be coming back to this location, will try another one and if it's the same service you will lose my business. We left after two beers and came to famous Dave's and have never been happier with not only the food and service!!!"}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and was looking for a nice, low key brewery/bar with variety. This place nailed it! Wide selection of great beer. Tasty apps and sliders. Nice patio area as well. Location is great near all the shops and other stores which you can walk to. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"This was my frist time at Brass Tap. It was a little challenging finding my way around Riverpoint parkway, but when I finally located the right path it wasn't hard to find. The bar was a good size and had plenty of beer on tap. They have a loyalty program, but I wasn't going to get involved in another one of those. I used to frequent a place that was similar, but it is no longer in business and I have been looking for a substitute. If I lived a little closer this would be a good choice. A lot of taps that are frequently rotating, some bottles, and knowledgable staff. I was surprised that they had on tap a Stone Russian Imperial Stout (2010). The first beer that converted me to craft was Stone Russian Imperial Stout in 2012. This was nice and mellow and certain one I will likely not encounter again. If you are near that part of town this would be an ideal spot."}
{"text":"Food was great, service is horrible. Bartender is rude and spent almost the entire time visiting with other employees that were there as customers. Majority of the people in the bar clearly work for the establishment and they continuously had obnoxious and inappropriate conversations throughout our entire meal. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because of the pretzels, everything else is a zero including the pizza. My margarita pizza came out missing half the toppings..."}
{"text":"One of the few places with a nice assortment of both draught and bottle craft beers. I have been able to sample many beers here and found some I really love. The servers have also been good at recommendations for beers when asked, particularly for bottles since you can't try before you buy. The food selection is just ok; I really like the pretzels and hummus, and their pretzel crust pizzas are really good, but I find the food is pricey for what you get and I tend to get bored of their options or feel hungry again when I leave. Their bottles and growler fills are also pricier than what I am used to finding."}
{"text":"The place has only been open a week and my first time trying it but hey, I can already tell this is a beer lover's sort of bar. I had taken my father to a movie at Cinemark 16, which is right across the way (in other words, good location) and then headed over here for a beer or two and some food.

The menu is not big but food that goes well with beer and for each item they have a recommendation for a specific style of beer. I had two Belgian's on tap and they were delicious and in addition, they have the right glasses for each type of beer and the employees are beer nerds, or at least the ones I met. 

As for food, my dad had a flat bread with tomatoes and some sort of cheese, that he seemed to like (going vegetarian in his old age - Tempe can liberalize even an old cowboy from Texas it seems) and I had the pretzel pizza with pepperoni and what seems like sweet Italian peppers - it was good but tend not to like things that are sweet unless it is in a dessert but hey still good.

All I can say, the Cinemark is great movie theater and this is a good place to come after the movie to chat and hang for a bit. I hope it does well, I know I certainly intend to frequent it two or three times a month. :-)

Oh, I did want to say that this is a chain (though a small one), like World of Beers but a little more on the cool vibe side, based on what I can see and the prices on beer at the Mesa location are extremely reasonable. I also liked that while the TVs were on, they were generally right above the bar and they were playing with the sound off and the music in the place was on but it wasn't overly loud, so my father and I could have a discussion with Mitch, the bartender (just has one more step to become a Cicerone - as I said, beer nerds) - maybe they crank things up as the night wears on, I don't know but for me it was a lovely, mellow atmosphere - I may not be Mikey, but I like it. :-)"}
{"text":"Hello Brass Tap!! This place just opened in the Mesa Riverview plaza, over by Toby Keith's. If you are a beer person, here is a new place to visit! Over 300 different beers to choose from! Did I just say 300!!! Yes!!! That many!!

I personally cant drink beer, but all my friends love it, so we ended up meeting here for my friends bday! Each of them enjoyed the large selection and were able to try a lot of beers they have never had before. While they were busy getting their drink on, I of course had to try the food! Their food menu is a little small (compared to having a choice of 300 different beers to drink, but hey its a beer bar) I went ahead and ordered the Pepperoni Peppadew Pretzel Pizza! Goodness gracious this pizza was delicious! The pretzel dough bread wasn't too thick to where your pizza was all bread and it had a great buttery/seasoned taste to it. The tomato sauce had a nice spice and the sweet peppers on top of the pizza along with the pepperoni, brought out a taste I have never had on a pizza before! It was delicious! These ingredients altogether made a really great pizza. The 7 1/2\" pizza was in my belly in about 2 minutes!

We came here on opening night, so the service wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't terrible. Opening night is always going to be a little hectic and stressful! I think the staff did a decent job though. Our waitress said they didn't have the flights for the beer taste testers yet, so she had to bring them by hand and it seemed like each time she mixed up the samples, so we didn't know which beer was which. So once they get those in, im sure that will get better. You are a beer bar though, you should have had those ready!! The service was also a little slow, but the bar was packed so you cant get too upset. The girls were running around trying to take care of everyone as best as they could.

This place is very relaxed, chill and on the small side. If you are looking to just enjoy an evening of beers, good friends and conversation, this is the place! No loud music, dancing or craziness. Over-all 3 stars for this new place as an A-OK! Gotta work out some of the little kinks and things will be better! Keep it up! Im sure I will be back!

*My friends votes are in and they say to try the Historic Deer Lord and the Petrus Aged Red beers! Cheers everyone!!*"}
{"text":"Bad experience! It wasn't that busy, but yet service was bad bad bad. The first waitress was rude and short. Second was ok but later had attitude along with the 3rd Waitress because they were all confused as to what was ordered. The food was awful. Don't order the stuffed cheese bread. Super salty served with almost ice cold marinara sauce. Also, the chicken nachos. Gross. I would have tried it again another time, but the rude staff killed it for me. ?"}
{"text":"I live just down the street from Mesa Riverview and of course as I'm getting ready to move, a group of friends and I met up here for trivia and drinks for the first time yesterday evening. TBT is right across from the entrance to the movie theater and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was pretty full the entire time we were there. It's clear that there was a need for a brewery and as they say, \"if you build it, they will come\". 

We were lucky to grab a table inside and I sipped on water and ciders the whole night, as did the rest of my group. Two people ordered their pizzas, which were good but a little overpriced in my opinion. The service was good and the prices on their drinks were reasonable. Only knocking them a star for the food prices and because the first two drinks I tried to order off of the menu were not in stock :("}
{"text":"Very knowledgable staff who have an obvious love for beer. They have over 60 different beers on tap and over 80 types of bottled beer.  The bartender gave us a very detailed run through of their local brews, specials as well as food menu. You can ask for a sample of any beer on draft before committing to an entire glass which I love! They have a bunch of TVs as well as table top games you can play.  There are two downfalls to this place that prevent me from giving it a higher rating.   They have a nice outdoor patio area but people sit out there and smoke cigars which not only keep me from sitting outside but the smoke comes into the bar through the giant open door. The second area for improvement is overall cleanliness of the bar and behind the bar. The food looked good but we did not have any this time around."}
{"text":"The wife and I popped in Sunday afternoon by bike on the new Rio Salado bike trail and had a few beers and salad. Great choice of beers and super friendly staff. Salad tasted fresh and came fast. Thanks"}
{"text":"Service was good and the beer selection was excellent. My only gripes were that the food selection was kind of limited and the servers didn't really seem knowledgeable about some of the beer and beer types which since they have more beer than food to choose from seems kind of important."}
{"text":"Maybe it is just me, but i don't consider a $9 - 10 ounce beer MODERATELY priced.  I also don't believe a 5% alcohol cider (ANY cider) should be $8 a glass (12 ounce, NOT 16) - the food was decent - and IT was moderately priced but the beers were outrageous.  As others have written, the service was mediocre at best, and when we went there was only one other couple there, and they already had their food - maybe the kitchen staff was on a smoke break - i know the wait staff went on several while we were there.  further, asking about the style, flavor or hoppiness (bitterness) of a beer will get you about the same accuracy of information as you would get if you asked someone who had never been there or had a beer.  I guess i'm just used to places where service is good, beer is priced appropriately and the staff know what they are serving."}
{"text":"First time here,  was a Saturday night.  Not busy.  Took thirty minutes for drinks,  an hour for food.  Have no idea if hold up was wait staff or kitchen.  We sent some food back for being cold. Rest of food was blah. Bar was out of multiple beers we ordered and we didn't find out until 20 min after ordering.  Wait staff needs training,  when a customer asks for a second glass so someone else at the table can taste tbeir beer,  don't reply,  'she can just drink out of the bottle',  bring the freakin glass over. Beer was okay but won't be back."}
{"text":"I am a great fan of this place. Their draught beer selection is great, food is spot on for the environment and there is great parking. There is a great selection of canned/bottled beers as well, I just prefer draft. Come here, relax and enjoy. 

The ONLY downside is there is little foot traffic, so don't come to people watch outward - the people watching has to happen inside.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a friend. Greeted promptly and felt welcome! Bailey was our server and she was great. She Recommended the brass tap blonde and brought out a taste of some peanut butter stout (which I didn't like very much but was happy for the amount of effort she went through to surprise us with something different). Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying everyone has their own experience,   and mine just happened to suck. My gf and I bought a Groupon for the brass tap  because we like to try new places. The only positive thing I can say is that they have a nice selection of beer...if they aren't out of the ones you choose. the food was ridiculous. we like to split, so we shared beer battered cod fish tacos,  pork sliders, and the chicken blt wrap. the tacos were not fried,  not beer battered, and came with stale store bought chips. our sliders,  which were decent, but had little pork, came with stale lays kettle chips. then the chicken blt (the safest and best of the three) came with macaroni that was cold because we watched our food sit on the bar while the only bartender/server ran around frantically serving a whopping 9 guests including us... I think what bums me out most, is i still have a Groupon for this place I probably will end up letting it expire... don't let my review keep you from going! like I said, I could have just had bad luck!! cheers!"}
{"text":"Lots of great beers. The food stinks.  Pretzel only item with flavor. It's bar food. Sorry but scrap the menu."}
{"text":"Huge beer selection that changes constantly.  With monthly 'brewery of the month' deals, you'll find yourself discovering new favorites every time you visit.  Lots of TVs makes it a great place to catch most sporting events. Standard bar food for a brew pub, but the pretzels and hummus are fantastic.  Walking distance from the Cinemark, so it's great place to grab a pint before/after you watch your stories on the big screen."}
{"text":"Very large beer selection. Looks like a scaled down version of world of beer. Kind of sucks their kitchen closes before 10 on a weekend. Beers are very pricey. Feels like the prices from angels trumpet ale house transpired over 6$ and up for most pints which is a bit much for local beers. First time here. Probably won't go out of my way to return. Plenty of breweries and gastro pubs with decent pricing and an open kitchen daily. Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"We love the Brass Tap and come here almost every 2 weeks or so. They have a massive selection of beers, they do trivia on Fridays, and they have a cute outdoor patio that allows dogs and sometimes has cornhole set up. Their pretzel with beer cheese is delicious and so are their pretzel pizzas. The other food items on the menu are nothing to write home about. The service is generally pretty good when it's not crowded, and the waitresses really seem to be doing their best. The place does seem somewhat understaffed on a Friday night. See you again soon, Brass Tap :)"}
{"text":"And people say there is nothing in Mesa! They are WRONG.

Brass tap is great, you can make your own beer flight and their selection is great. I heard their IPA's are nice and bitter (I personally do not like bitter beer so definitely try it for yourself and take my friends word for it)

Also, come here on Friday at 6pm - they have a beer school going on every Friday! Later in the evening a live one man band plays (pretty impressive) and they have pretty great food.

We had the pretzels with dipping sauces, but I look forward to trying the pretzel pizza!
I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"My new favorite hangout. Friendly and informative staff. Try their ham and cheese panini its wonderful. If you love beers this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer!  Prices are kind of high and the food is a disaster!  Our service was not much better than the food.  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"Tried the pretzel pizza, and it's fantastic, and it was cheap. I ONLY want pizza served on a pretzel dough crust now! Would recommend to anyone needing good food and beer, at a good price, fast."}
{"text":"Always a great beer line up!  Friendly and knowledgable staff are always ready to serve.  A limited, but tasty, pub menu.  Great special events, these guys are always giving back to the local community as well as veterans.  A great place to enjoy some good beers!"}
{"text":"Place is a cute little beer bar! Great beer selection too. Our server megan was really nice and helpful! We had the hummus and the pretzel pizzas and they were both really tasty!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! Stopped by real quick while shopping at Mesa Riverview. Wonderful drink specials, SO many delicious beers, great environment. Feels like a Midwest bar, customers talk to each other like family. Food came out in 15 minutes (pulled pork sandwich and pizza) both tasted great! I will add this is the perfect place to watch football on Sundays. They've got every game playing - all easy to see. I recommend this place for any beer/football lovers of all ages."}
{"text":"This place has a serious draft and bottles/canned beer selection. If you join their Brew Crew you get a t-shirt and a card to track how many different beers you've had. The service is really good! Our waitress and bartender were very helpful and informative on their beer selection. The only problem with this place is the food. Way too overpriced for the quantity and quality of food you get. Will definitely frequent this place for more beer!"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't move from Mesa. This bar was my favorite bar in the state, maybe the country. The knowledgeable bartender's know there beer very well. As a beer snob I can definitely appreciate that. The selection of beer is incredibly awesome. The inside is clean and classy. The food is just as good as the beers they serve (Recommend the crack dip). The place is truly amazing and prices are not that unreasonable. 

I miss this bar and usually will not write a review about a place unless something stands out. The fact that I haven't been here in a couple months and truly appreciate the level of service from here is pretty impressive on its own. I hope the owners of brass tap can educate the owners of the dunes in Phoenix on 35th and Dunlap. Or buy them out and open a location over here. That would rock. 

You guys are amazing keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Good beer, good options, nice people. I like it here. But tonight ... 8 people and the food came out in shifts over 10-15 minutes. Not so great. If you are just here for beer, good choice. Otherwise eat someplace else and stop by for a beer after."}
{"text":"Great new spot on the Eastside,  finally! 

A nice selection of craft beer that's reasonably priced,  great food to munch on and knowledgeable staff.  Definitely a place you will want to come back to!"}
{"text":"Lots of beer, delicious food! 

There is something for everyone at this local brewhouse"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection! Food wasn't great, but maybe we just didn't try the right thing. We got two of the pretzel appetizers and weren't overly impressed. But the beer menu made up for it, so we will still be back again! Maybe just after we eat!"}
{"text":"This place has the ultimate tap list and beer list period.  At least 100 beers to choose from that cover a lot of areas in the states.  

The best part is if you become a member they keep track of what you drink and if you hit certain milestones they put your name on the wall.  The staff is friendly and knows the beer pretty good.  

You can sit inside or outside. We ordered some appetizers not to bad we got the pretzel bites which were really good and the lettuce wraps not to bad. 

Overall we will be coming back since I became a member lol"}
{"text":"I went here for a date night and was pleasantly surprised how many beer they have. Not your typical supply, rather diverse and they even had an amazing sour by Jolly Pumpkin. MMMMM

They food was a little pricey for my taste but it was really well done. The prime rib nachos were amazing.

Meg our server was amazing. She helped me pick out beers for the flight and was super attentive. We can't wait to go back and try more beers!"}
{"text":"I don't really drink beer but they have a huge amount of taps and bottles and I try and get my friends to order the ones I think look interesting.  The food is very good I love the prime rib nachos!  The pizza is also great and different as it's on a pretzel bread crust.  The bartenders have always been fantastic and really friendly.  The only thing I would change is them having iced tea, as I don't really drink soda, so my only option is water."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would! Served warm beer and the food was a joke! Never again....."}
{"text":"Great for a beer lover! It really was just that basically every food item they served seemed to be premade and bought in bulk at SAMs club, lots of microwave and convection-oven usage. None of the food was super appealing and we left there being unhappy about the food we ate. It was all very clean with kind and prompt service, it was just that the food was uninspired and that made us feel sad and unfulfilled. Also, the trivia night guy was not good at all and that did contribute to our happiness level on the night but was obviously not their fault! We will be back but I will eat beforehand"}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beer!  During my daytime visit there was plenty of seating and service was very good.  Food menu seemed a bit limited, but at least they seemed to be good at the limited food items that were available.  I'd rather have that, than a beer bar that tries to do too many things and few of them are worth eating.  Prices were all over the place for various beers compared to what I pay elsewhere.  Not sure if I was mischarged or if they really do differentiate like that on purpose.  Parking was great."}
{"text":"Came to the brass tap after a cubs game. It was fun! I think I'm not meant to go to craft beer bars though. I asked my bartender if he could recommend a beer that is similar to coors light since that's what I love to drink. He looked at me and said \"yeah I can serve you a glass of water\"... then continued to give me a blank look.. I chuckled and said \"ok, OK good one. I'm not into craft beers so if you could recommend something like coors light I'd appreciate it\"... again he said \"yeah I told you a glass of water\". This was inappropriate since I was trying to give him hard earned American currency for a beer. I ended up just getting what my buddy got a blonde ale, which the bartender could have recemmended instead of being a smart ass.the rest of the visit was great. Food was delicious, I got chicken wrap with peri peri sauce which was amazing! I'll definitely go back since I know I like the blonde ale, and I don't have to ask the beer snob."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday- BONUS- it's trivia night!

The hubby found this killer find next to our hotel. Lots and lots of brews on tap! They bold and italicize the local ones to make it easy to discover new favorites.

Our party of four sat at the corner of the bar and was indulging in beer and appetizers. I have a new favorite, Hanger 24. A local wheat beer that is phenomenal. We ordered the pretzel with mustard- very tasty but nothing crazy. The brisket nachos did not quite live up to my expectations but I would order and eat them again. I can't articulate why they were kinda 'meh,' but they were.

The trivia game was a real game changer. Suddenly tons of people started pouring into the establishment, eager to snatch a seat... And no one left until a victor was made. This was around 10pm and then it was just us again. Strange but true. 

We ended up scoring below 3rd place...  We were in first before that third round of brewskis..."}
