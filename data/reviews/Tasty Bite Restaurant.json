{"text":"Tasty Bite is nothing shy of its name.   This is one of those lower-end d√©cor restaurants, such as Lahore Tikka House, whose food immediately puts to shame the majority of \"high end\" Indian restaurants in and around the city.   This restaurant was recommended to me by a good friend of mine who was preaching on me the amazingness of Tasty's menu with specific emphasis on the chicken tikka masala. Fortunately, I attended this restaurant with 6 other patrons which allowed all of us the opportunity to try several dishes.   Tasty Bite's version of chicken tikka masala was unlike any other that I have tried in my lifetime. It was apparent by the texture of the chicken that it was pre-marinated in spices and yogurt. As for the sauce, I was expecting the standard creamy-tomato sauce but what arrived to the table was well different. The sauce was more a greenish-brown colour leading me to believe they added saag (spinach) and dhania (coriander/cilantro) to a brown curry sauce base. Massive chunks of onions gave this dish a beautiful texture and the flavour of this dish was uniquely outstanding.  The next dish I was highly anticipating was the Malai Kofta as it has always been one of my favourite north Indian dishes. It consists of vegetarian meatballs which are derived from a combination of paneer, potatoes, raisins, cashews and an array of other ingredients and spices. The sauce is a rich, creamy, tomato sauce with a beautifully thick consistency. I well enjoyed this dish and at this junction in the meal I realized Tasty Bite was entering the realm of \"Amazing restaurants I know of\".  The dhal makhni, a slow cooked black lentil dish with mad spices and Malai cream was delicious with a gorgeous consistency. The raita, a yogurt condiment flavoured with ingredients like dhania and cucumber was cool and thick. As for the naan it was whole wheat! Can you frigging' believe that? I have never had whole wheat naan in my life and I must say it was solid, you also feel a slight bit healthier shoveling down mad heavy cream and butter sauces with it.   Of course visiting any North Indian restaurant for the first time and ordering a plethora of dishes sans butter chicken is a major sin, so we ordered two. The sauce is essentially the same as the Malai Kofta and the dish was a successful rendition of the \"most popular dish in the world\". Again, perfect consistency in the texture of this dish, in fact Tasty Bite boasted solid consistency throughout all their dishes. A friend of mine informed me that this is achieved by reducing the sauce down to a suitable consistency, and subsequently adding ground nuts such as cashews and almonds the sauce to give it that delectably smooth and nutty consistency. Bravo.  Tasty Bite is a sound stop for North Indian food. I will most definitely be visiting this Brampton gem again in the near future and for years to come.   P.S. Full bar  =P"}
{"text":"A review is an indviduals personal preference and choice. Yes the ambiance is old and or not liked by others but the food is always good. I have ordered butter chicken and veg biryani which is faaar better than any other indian restaurants serving uncooked rice. It is located near to the intersection of derry and torbram near to all industrial area. I liked this place than other indian restaurants...."}
