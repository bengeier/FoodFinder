{"text":"I literally stalked bubbles for days before I found the food trucks lined up on midvale on Tuesday night. But it was so worth it for me. Studying abroad in Trinidad, i have a more varied judgement about real Trini food, and I know how hard it is to make doubles. I give Bubbles tons of credit because it's a true skill. 

However, I do have to say that I was expecting some more heat and spice to my doubles. But I think for most Madisonians, it's probably more than fine. I'm hoping bubbles prospers enough to add some more ingredients to his rotis also in the future. 

For all you who never lived there, this will be the closest you'll get to the paradise of East Indian food - definitely worth a try. You may see me there."}
{"text":"The owner is very kind and knowledgeable. When visiting had the Veggie Double which was flavorful, delicious and filling for an afternoon snack. Try one of you have the chance!"}
{"text":"I love food carts. This cart rocks harder than almost any food cart in my recent memory.  I love the introduction to street food from Trinidad and Tobago, called a double. I had the vegetarian with spiced chickpeas in a thin fried flour-based wrap thing,  kind of like a chapati. $3. Yes,  you read that right: lunch for $3. Cheaper,  really,  when you factor in the punch card:5 doubles and the sixth is free. So, really,  lunch for $15/6. You do the math,  but it's under $3."}
{"text":"Have only tried it once, but it's a keeper. My double (is it still a doubles if it's singular?) was very fresh and delicious, and the size was perfect for a light lunch, but it would work well as a snack too. Doubles are also super portable, which is a plus. I haven't had a roti yet, but it's definitely on my list. I just hope the menu expands in the future, because now I want more!

Also, I have to (once again) applaud a food cart's customer service - I'm never disappointed in any of the people that run carts around the square. Bubbles was no exception. He initially thought I was a regular, and when I said no, he was super excited for my introduction to the world of doubles. He gave me a punch card (buy 5 doubles, get the 6th free) and even showed me the best way to eat it so it wouldn't fall apart on me! So awesome."}
{"text":"Update, having tried the roti, I am bumping the review up to five stars.  The roti is awesome, and I would recommend getting either it or a doubles with everything.  The roti is like a big burrito, but filled with spiced potatoes, chickpeas, and chicken if you want.  Great seasonings, but the real winner is the wrap, it is kind of like the crust from a pasty, but tastes almost a little like potatoes, super tender and flavorful, and obviously homemade.  So good!

Second update:  There are two updates I feel I need to note.  First, they have added a new pork option for both the double and roti, so now there is veggie, chicken, and pork.  The pork is insanely good, it is slow cooked, super tender, with tons of flavor, and there is a lot of it, I can't recommend it enough.

The second thing I want to point out is that Yelp still says the cart is down by the square, but it has moved, and is now full time on Dayton street, by Union South, on the corner of Dayton and Charter.  It is there most of the time, but does seem to take a day, sometimes two off each week.  I would recommend checking the Facebook page, he normally posts daily if he will be out or not."}
{"text":"Trini food in Madison...shocking..They specialize in 2 choices...Roti & doubles..Ordered the Veggie Doubles which were not greasy as many places tend to cook them but were testy."}
