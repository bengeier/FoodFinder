{"text":"First time at Pasta La Vista in Airdrie we were here for lunch for a party of 7 adults and 1 child.  The service was outstanding, the waiter was very professional.  The waiter brought to the table yummy melt in your mouth bread that you dipped in this balsamic/Olive oil,garlic sauce.   
I ordered a New York steak with rosemary roasted potatoes and veggies this also comes with all you can eat soup or salad.  The steak was cooked to perfection. 
Parking is limited just to be aware when you come for lunch or super.  
We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Good service. Everything else was okay. It is a regular pasta place that has a pretty good range of menu. Atmosphere is okay with comfortable seating. Music is light so relaxing and comfortable for chatting. The food taste alright, nothing to boast for. Good to try but it will not be my go to."}
{"text":"My first visit since owner/name change and the food was extremely underwhelming. Roughly every 2 months my wife and I grab lasagna to go. This portion was half the size and approximately $4.00 more than previous. The quality was close to grocery store freezer bought and the garlic bread was a bun cut in half that tasted a day or more old. I cannot comment on the service or any other entrees but visually the restaurant did look cleaner and updated. We will now search for another restaurant for our lasagna for plane watching at the airport."}
{"text":"First time visit to Pasta La Vista and was really impressed. Party of three, all had different entrees and everyone was happy with their meal. The price included bread and soup or salad. Dessert was very good. The prices were reasonable and the service was GREAT. We will definitely be going again."}
