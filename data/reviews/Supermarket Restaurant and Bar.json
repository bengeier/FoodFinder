{"text":"The Supermarket never disappoints - I love this place! I was there Friday night for dinner and had all my favourites. The sweet potato chips, the jerk pork and the grilled chimichurri steak - WOW! After dinner, the live bands are usually good and the djs always play a good mix of music. I highly recommend this place for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Top place in the market for food, top place for live music and top place for drinks. 
Great place for adults or meetings and a great place to take the kids for dinner. 
Staff if friendly and nice. 
I have never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"I'm pretty easy to please but I went here once with a friend and had a really bad experience. As in, everything our server brought to our table was not what we had ordered...and she was rude about it when we let her know. Maybe she was new? It all came to a head when my friend was served her entree. It wasn't what she had ordered (I think they gave her the wrong side) so she was going to send it back...but my meal was going to be another 10 minutes. Our server expected her to eat while I waited for my entree. She seemed a bit frustrated when we said we weren't going to stay. We paid for our drinks and went for a slice of pizza. One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Fresh and Excellent Flavour!
If you like Asian fusion and fresh tasting food, you will love supermarket.  This is a 'go to' restaurant in a great area of Toronto.  My wife and I love the green mango salad, grilled calamari and have tried most things on the menu.  You will be planning your next visit after your first bite."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try Supermarket for a while and finally got the chance to go for lunch.  
Although the lunch menu was not as extensive as the dinner the food was fast and good.  Our server ways so friendly and engaging with out being over bearing.  
Myself and my friend enjoyed the food and environment.
Defiantly a thumbs up"}
{"text":"Once known for its broken furniture, sticky floor, and pool tables, 268 Augusta is now home to one of the best bar relocations in recent history. Supermarket came to this address when the owners of the much-loved Lava lost that location. With the new location comes a lot of brand new things. Like three different areas, a glassed in seating area at the front, an eating area (slightly raised) and a patio that spills out onto the sidewalk. 
The walls are usually covered with the art work of some local artist or another, making this more than just a club come night fall. The food is also quite good, and there's a lot of it. The music is eclectic, quite enjoyable even for people who usually don't like the club scene. And because of the seating areas those who prefer to sit and mingle and chat can do so without feeling strange."}
{"text":"Welp, Supermarkets in my experience are never known for good service.

Food. Good.
Environment. Good.
Service. . . meh, but tolerable. 

At least most of the servers were attractive (but that could have been because of the booze - which is actually really well priced)."}
{"text":"Came here to have drinks with two friends. Waitress came and ask us whether we wanted anything 3 times in 45 minutes bringing the bill the third time. Left the place without drinking half of my second glass. Extremely rude behaviour. The bar has several empty tables."}
{"text":"Just hand one of my favorite Pad Thai's from this place!

Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. The bar is mediocre to begin with and the non-existent service makes it a dealbreaker."}
{"text":"I know I know, you wont believe it, but those guys have an amazing food. it is all about sharing so come ready to order many plates and share with your friends. They have live shows so ensure which day it runs. very nice and casual atmosphere. highly recommended. been there 10-15 times, love it each time."}
{"text":"I went here after pre-gaming with friends so I only got to witness the club aspect of it and I enjoyed it! Cover was $8 on a Saturday night and the music was fun!

Drinks are moderately priced for Toronto and the sitting are by the bar is nice too. Definitely want to hit it up again sometime."}
{"text":"I was here for a poetry slam a few weeks ago, the menu was interesting and the food was good, but the service? Terrible. They pretty much ignored us, and when the girl took our order she said we had to come get our order at the front because the show we paid to see in the back was not being serviced, which was fine, I understand but she was not pleasant about it at all. When I got my order it was wrong, and the lady basically scowled at me for correcting her and tried to say I was wrong and when I told her I wasn't happy with her service she said \"phht\" and walked away lol WOW... I am the nicest and most polite person and have worked in customer service my entire life... and even though I was respectful when I mentioned I was unhappy with the service, she was even more rude... I was really taken aback by this especially since the manager was listening but pretended not to hear us lol I left and got food and drinks at another venue and brought it back to enjoy while watching the slam show, in the back room, and no one at the counter noticed when I walked back in with food and drinks from somewhere else. 

I will never come back here, Customer Service is the most important thing to me, because every single person is a customer, a consumer, and works to help customers in some sort of way... We should all treat one another with courtesy, respect and kindness, the same way we would like to be treated regardless of how our day is going because everyone is fighting some sort of battle in their lives and we should greet everyone we meet with kindness. 

Okay I am done ranting lol"}
{"text":"Horrible service...Nuff said.  You are better off at Ronnie's local on Nassau.  Better scene, better service."}
{"text":"I feel like it's my duty to tell the world how good this restaurant is. Most people are unaware that this \"bar\" serves amazing food!!! I've been here probably about 8 times for dinner, usually ordering the same thing. I've had 2 orders of grilled calamari at one sitting (it will melt in your mouth!) The prices are very cheap, the quality of the food is incredible, and the menu is plentiful with something to offer for everyone's tastes. I highly suggest the grilled calamari, the Argentinian steak, the pork dish, the dimsum, and the grilled beans. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"i went to the supermarket on a satuarday for a girlfriend of mines birthday. i payed 5 dollar cover and we took our seats at the side end of the lounge. our server was a big guy who came to us about 5 min after we seated ourselves and ordered our drinks. he forgot to order and bring one of our drinks, quickly apologized and brought another drink within 3 min. the music was wack meaning not my style...at first. now when the dance floor opened up me and my friends decided to move there to a crumy little side table which i guess in club term can be sorta considered as a \"booth\". i had almost twisted my foot that night (not because of anything in the bar) so i was sitting down for the first hour of the night. so i observed. i noticed all my friends who were dancing and drinking all looked like they just took a shower!...weird...normally in a club i understand that when your dancing and drinking you sweat...but not like this!!! after i started dancing (a little) cuz the music ended up being just OK. i noticed that even when i was moving almost at all i started sweating so hard as if i was in a steam room (gross). so i decided to check out the bathrooms. to my surprise there was a group of girls standing by the door and sinks talking blocking the sinks for anyone who wanted to wash there hands and not moving. the bathrooms were filthy! and offcourse someone was puking in the stall. there was water everywhere, it was so nasty. at this point i went for a smoke to my luck i walked into a full view with another girl just puking her little heart out by the outside entrance for a good half an hour. the bouncers seeing this didnt even offer her any water...where is the compasion and the humanism (hope thats an actuall word and if its not, it should be). didnt try the food but judging from the entire place and how dirty it looked dont think i would ever go back to try it anyways."}
{"text":"I'll give Supermarket 4 stars due to the fact that it's been a very reliable first date venue for me. Being in the mouth of Kensington, while still being very easy to find that makes this location ideal. There's a crowded little patio out front that is nice if you can get a table. I usually start things out early so that if it goes well, we've got a lot of evening left and if not, I can say goodnight early and still have a lot of evening left. Therefore, the patio has been good to me.

Inside, it's a nice lounge. Not small but not large, it's a longish room that opens to a dance floor/concert venue. It's a nice place to see a good band and a bad place to see a bad band. 

The food is very good here though I find myself usually sticking to gin or rye. I've heard very good things about the pad thai. 

The location makes for a good starting or ending point. Either way, I'd suggest including Ronnie's in the market and the Cameron House on Queen in your plan for the evening."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've never had the food here. BUT i HAVE partied it up tons of times in the backroom dancefloor. They have top 40 music with a lot of throwback (mostly 90s) mixed in. My favourite place to dance in Toronto (thank gawwwd because i'm OVER clubbing). People that come here are usually around early 20s. It is dead around 10pm but can get pretty packed around midnight-1am so i'd say aim for 1030-11 to get there."}
{"text":"We walked in when the doors opened for dinner on a Saturday night and it was utterly deserted. Service was sarcastic and rude even though there were no other patrons. The food consisted of fake Asian influenced pub food and deep fried everything.

Kind of admired the concert space in the back but it's the usual dingy, painted black walls and sticky floors."}
{"text":"Popped in here today for a late lunch, we were very tempted to order some of the tapas but we were so hungry we decided to go with an entree instead.

I ordered the Argentian style flank steak which came with house cut fries and salad. The steak was cooked perfectly to my medium order and served with chimmichurri. It was excellent, very tender and melt in your mouth texture. The fries were perfect, crisp on the outside, not soggy on the inside, and salted perfectly. I asked for just a mixed greens salad as I don't like mushrooms and it came with a balsamic vinaigrette on the baby greens. It was a perfect sized serving and I would order it again. 

My friend ordered the chicken and shrimp pad Thai. The bowl was HUGE! It could easily have served two or three people. Amazing amount of food for the price. And it included a lot of chicken and shrimp, which he said was excellent. 

It was a very hot and humid day in the city and my friend had a pint of the Market Pale Ale, which was very refreshing, not too hoppy, but very flavourful. I tried the Kensington Market Watermelon Wheat, which came in a tall can and was very smooth, with the watermelon flavour on the finish.

Definitely plan to visit again and try some of the tapas next time."}
{"text":"Many moons ago, my friend and I frequented Bread and Circus, a Kensington staple that offered the kind of ramshackle, casual dining/event experience that you could only find in a neighborhood like this. (We used to go here to see burlesque shows - don't tell anyone.)

I'm happy to report that Supermarket definitely carries the same spirit of that dearly-departed venue. Hell, it even looks the same! There are a few caveats, but I found the experience to be pleasant and enjoyable.

I came here early with a friend last Saturday evening (as of this writing), as we were waiting for an event (drunk karaoke - you don't sing, you just watch other groups do it) to begin. The place definitely has a very laid-back, chill vibe in the early evening, and we both chatted and looked around the dim restaurant/bar with a drink menu written above in chalk. The other reviews speak truly when they say that the place becomes a bit unbearable volume-wise as the evening progresses, so if you mean to come here just to have a quiet dinner, this may not be the spot for you.

Service is hit-or-miss. One of the waiters brought us a menu and drinks, then disappeared for a solid hour after we made our orders - and we didn't even order much, just a side of fries and a burger entree for her. Later in the evening, after our other friends had joined us, we met a hipster (who I think may be the owner of the restaurant) who offered to comp our meals for free if we could guess the name of a DJ who was playing on the radio. Needless to say, we failed, but his quaint attitude was refreshing and much appreciated in a place like this.

The menu is quite spartan, but it does have fusion elements. Alongside standard bar staples, you have more exotic fare like Laotion spring rolls, Chinese long beans, wok-fried green curried chicken and Argentinian-style steak with chimichurri. I wasn't nearly so bold, and settled for a plate of fries ($6). While they didn't set the world on fire, I was given a generous portion of big beefeater fries that were cooked extremely well, and that's all I needed.

My friend settled for the burger ($12). She didn't seem that impressed with the onion jam, but reported that the rest of it tasted fine. My two other companions, who showed up later in the evening, settled for a burger and the chicken/shrimp pad thai ($14). The latter wasn't received all that well - it wasn't a huge portion size, and yet he still left a fair amount of it unfinished at the end of the meal. I don't know whether that was due to not enjoying it or just getting too full.

The experience was solid, and I could see myself coming back here again. Supermarket like the kind of restaurant that you'd just show up to on a lark, and it has a decent atmosphere, solid (though not amazing) food and some spotty service. It's definitely a place that you'll want to visit at least once."}
{"text":"Great dance floor and set list, seating area and full bar! Pad Thai is huge and delicious!!! The only cons for a frugal gal like me: $10 cover and $3 coat check PLUS $3 for your bag (they won't put it together...)"}
{"text":"This venue is very popular, has noteworthy events and is a good hustle on occasion.  However, it is an oddball in the Kensington Market.  It arrived one day, by moving from an older location with a following.  

People come here long distances by taxis.

Many of the people involved in the SuperMarket, either by partying or working there, have a different quality of personality that is easily visible around the Market.

However, this is what makes the Market unique: there are many walks of life here, no one cares if you are odd as long as they're odd.

Huh?"}
{"text":"What a great concept space. Great food, great dancing, great DJ.  The bar area gets freakin' packed on weekends and it's kind of a younger crowd.  So, watch your toes.  
Come early for dinner- enjoy the tapas style green beans and tofu dishes share some thai chicken or other pan-asian specialties.  Then, stay for the dancing in the back.  Singles- galore!"}
{"text":"J'ai eu l'occasion d'aller à ce bar car un mes amis y joue régulièrement.
Le principe est simple, les artistes s'inscrivent sur la liste et ont droit à 2 chansons sur scène.
Le bar est tout en longueur et très spacieux.

I had the occasion to go to that bar because of of my friends is a regular singer here.
How it works : singers just put their name on a guest list and then can sing 2 songs on stage.
Very wide bar with a lot space."}
{"text":"Great place...we have an annual Xmas party for our staff here...very lively...not stuffy atmosphere for mingling...terrific staff...and fantastic Thai-inspired food...have never heard anything but positive comments from all attendees."}
{"text":"Almost every time I've been here it's been a whole different experience. The first time I ever went was a weekend night with a lot of dancing and a lot of fun. Last time I went was on a Sunday night, very calm and not so busy, when they had the open mic night going on which was nice. I ordered something to eat here for the first time and was surprised at the menu. I saw multiple things that seemed good but ended up having the chicken pad thai, which was delicious."}
{"text":"My friends have always told me how cool and amazing Supermarket is. 

Guess what? It's not. 

Maybe they were talking about clubbing or whatever, but I'm not talking about the dance floor. I'm talking about their food! I'm talking about their customer service!

I came here with three other people on a Sunday at 5. Their menu looked way too overpriced for the quality of food I knew I would be getting, but whatever, it was a nice day and we were enjoying a nice day at a new bar. 

I'm just looking at their website right now, and it's crazy how cool and nice the restaurant seems, but don't do it. It's a fucking trap. (Go to Trinity Commons instead). 

I ordered the fish tacos (2 for $11). My boyfriend got the green curry, my friend got the burger and our fourth person ordered the steak. 

My dish was mediocre (fish lacked really any flavor) and my boyfriend's green curry didn't have rice. (Excuse, thai curry with no rice/!??!), but I think the worst part was my friend's burger. Burger Friend asked me if it was okay to eat the patty if the inside was a deep red color. Clearly, the patty was red on the inside. I consulted my boyfriend and we came to a somewhat consensus that maybe the patty was medium rare/rare. I told Burger Friend that it should be okay. 

Burger Friend was not that satisfied with my response, so he asked the waitress if the burger was undercooked. 

And the waitress said with attitude and cockiness, \"Oh we cook all our burgers like that. It's medium. Most people like medium so we cooked the burger as medium. If you want it more done, I can take it back.\" 

Burger Friend said, \"Nah, don't worry. As long as I can eat it and won't get sick, it's fine.\" 

And throughout this whole exchange, I was like: O_O

MEDIUM??? MEDIUM?!??!?! (Gordon Ramsay's voice came out: \"IT'S FUCKING RAWWW!!!\")

THERE WAS NO WAY IN HELL THE BURGER WAS MEDIUM. As a quite experienced home cook (at least I like to think I am), I KNEW that the burger was not a medium. 

I pulled out my phone and googled what a medium burger looked like. Lo and behold, the  burger my friend had WAS DEFINITELY NOT A MEDIUM. And according to the pictures, the burger looked more rare than medium rare. 

I still CANNOT believe the girl, who is a waitress, DID NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MEDIUM BURGER AND A RARE BURGER. THAT IS SCARY. 

Food business owners: please educate your waiters and waitresses. 

I am appalled.

The steak that came to our fourth friend was equally as horrendous. The steak looked like it was cut in half from what you would think a piece of sliced steak usually looks like. It seemed like they were running low on steak or they were stingy with their portions because steak is expensive. The rest of her plate was overloaded with salad and fries. 

I will never go back. 

This place currently has a 2/5, (which is a terrible rating already), but if my friend gets a bad stomach bug tomorrow, this restaurant will go down to a 1 (and you don't want to mess with restaurants with a 1-star review). 

TLDR; Waitress doesn't know difference between medium and rare. Come here for drinks, not food."}
{"text":"In my honest opinion Supermarket is one of the culinary treasures of Toronto. Not to sound corny or cliche but for me this is the kind of restaurant that reflects what Toronto is. A cultural melange of foods and styles, the worn and eclectic interior and the pseudo-hipster staff that run the place.

The food is amazing and so diverse. For me fusion cooking usually means no style at all. But Supermarket deftly holds true to the Thai, Tapas, etc., blend while also bringing something of their own to it.

This is the ideal spot for a group of 4 or 6 people as it really allows you to affordably try some of everything. Plus the relaxed atmosphere makes you want to take your time, savor the food and enjoy some conversation. 

Supermarket has become a staple for my group of friends and it's never too long between visits. We feel guilty returning to the same spot, but when the whole package is so good, it's tough not to."}
{"text":"Supermarket is a \"super\" fun dance venue. It's such a breath from all the clubs dt where it's crammed w people trying to grind up on u constantly: and I love how the music is fun and bouncy and not dub step like. The phrase \"oldies but goodies\" comes to mind! It is a small venue, but cover is cheap and it's always a fun crowd!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, great atmosphere but too bad it was all booked, our seats were back at the stage area. We had the tuna vegetables, mango salad, and Argentina style steak. Presentation was very nice and flavourful.

Would love to go back and try more, this time we'll make reservations more than a couple of hours ahead."}
{"text":"I am going to have to deviate from the crowd a bit on this one...this was truly one of the WORST experiences I've ever had in a restaurant.  It was so bad, I'm not even sure where to start.

After being seated, we were promptly given menus, and drinks.  We all ordered (dumplings, steak sandwich, pad thai, singapore noodles).  Minutes pass.  Dumplings arrive.  20 minutes later, a burger arrives.  In error.  We think.  Manager eats burger.  Drinks are emptied.  Singapore noodles arrive.  No offer of drink refill.  Another 20 minutes pass.  Pad Thai arrives.  Server leaves before we can speak up about drinks.  
We finally decide to forget about the steak sandwich and  get up to leave when it finally arrives - a full 1 hour and 20 minutes from being seated.

Granted, it was Canada Day.  They MAY have been understaffed.  The fact that the food was so-so is excusable.  The wait for all the food items was unacceptable.  The lack of acknowledgment of the issues was, what really thew me over the edge.  I've been a server before.  I know shit happens out of your control.  At that point, you go to the table, apologize, explain the situation, and offer a round of drinks.  Whats worse, the manager was there the whole time.  Sitting behind us and playing on the computer.
Never again."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend for a little team outing. I must say, this place was a surprise, but a very pleasant surprise.

My party of 5 got to the line at about 10:30pm. No one was in front of us and the place looked far from packed from the outside, but I think this place wanted to build some hype, so they made us stand outside for 5 mins before letting us in. When we got in, it was pretty empty- tons of tables available, but at about 11:30, the place really started to fill up. Drinks were pretty reasonably priced at this place, but they were also kinda weak. I got a couple SoCo limes, and it was really sweet, mostly because the majority of my drink was bar lime and not SoCo. Whateves, good thing I pre-drank.

As for the music, I loved it! They were playing an eclectic mix of motown, 80's pop music, and some 90's hip hop, rap, and hood faves... hahaha (yeah, that stuff that white girls love to bump to.) Very danceable, great time, great energy on the dance floor (even though it was really packed).

Anyways, I really liked this place. The crowd was really good and the bartender let me cash out immediately on my credit card although she said that they don't usually allow it. Great service. I'm def going to be back."}
{"text":"ok I can't really review the restaurant part of the supermarket as we always only come here for dancing as a back up plan (once bread&circus was packed and two other times the boat was packed (is that even surprising?))

it's not a bad place because the entrance fee is always $5 which is cheap and the music is ok. but in reality you have to wait for a DJ until midnight or so for a reasonably good music to start.

regarding the dining part - I would suggest to make reservations esp for bigger groups as it seems to be always fully packed."}
{"text":"You can get the following at the SuperMarket: 

 Brunch on the weekends from 11-3, dinner after 5:30 pm, live music, a dance floor, a spot for big parties, and a great tapas spread. SuperMarket is a unique place located in Kensington market (on Augusta just south of Spadina).

 It isn't your typical bar/restaurant and there are a few things to keep in mind before you go; there are two dinner 'times.' The first is the early dinner being served around 5:30/6:00 pm and the second is a later dinner around 8:00 pm. 

The menu is the same (tapas style with a check-off menu given to the patrons to hand to the 'waiter') but there is usually a cover charge for the 8:00 pm dinner as a live music show is part of it. (Early dinner guests are supposed to vacate if the house gets full, as priority is given to the later guests).

 The dance floor is quite big and every weekend there are live shows. You will find indie-alternative rockers, jazz, country and usually mellow musicians at SuperMarket. Lastly, you can book parties or events at SuperMarket and the bar has a number of separate areas for this! All in all, a great place in a fun location!"}
{"text":"Really sweet place!! For both food and night happnins. I've been here for an open mic and dancing before, and more recently for food. Both times I had a really enjoyable experience.

For the food, I tried:

Curried lamb spring rolls - thin crispy outside filled with curried ground lamb. It was very good.

Jerk pork - it came with a spicy dipping sauce. This was a hearty and filling appetizer for sure! Delicious as well.

Shrimp and crab tacos - two of them, came on hard square shells. I really liked it (could taste the eggplants in there) Mmmmmmm. Great flavour combo.

Thai mango salad - this was my least favourite of what we ordered. Still good, but wasn't sure of the sauce that was on it. Sweet and spicy at the same time. It was a generous portion size. 

All in all, great food. And of course I have to mention that our server was fantastic. 

I certainly have respect for this establishment, as it hosts lots of cool events, AND has a solid menu. Don't forget to check in on yelp for 25% off your bill!!!"}
{"text":"It's too bad what happened to Supermarket. We used to go all the time years ago and the service was fantastic. I recently moved back to Toronto and was excited to go back to Supermarket last night.  We got there around 9 and we were a large group that got an awesome table. The drinks were flowing and we were having a great time until our waitress told us that she didn't charge us for a bottle of wine. She had charged the table beside us instead and said \"they weren't going to pay for it\". 

At this point in the night we were paying for our drinks at the bar so none of us remembered not paying for a bottle of wine. I mean, we were all paid up. The server had settled with us half an hour earlier. I know mistakes happen, but this server didn't even have the bills we paid before to show us. She just showed up to our table and demanded that we look for the bill we just paid.

Anyways, her tone was condescending like we had done something wrong. I literally could not believe the way she was talking to us. Notice to the management - hire servers that are professional and know how to treat customers.

My friend ended up paying for this extra bottle of wine just to get her off our case."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection, stocked bar, and the food is pretty good too. Lots of place to sit, so its great for larger groups. 

You can get better food in the neighborhood, but it's a one stop shop so you get a bit of everything - hence Supermarket."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, service seems good but the ambiance is lacking and the furniture is uncomfortable..."}
{"text":"Had a group event here and I can't speak highly enough of how communicative and helpful the staff were, not to mention it's a good looking spot in a great location. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Although I didn't have dinner here we came at 9 after our party had finished and without paying cover waited for the dance floor to clear. 

On Saturdays $5 cover after 9:30 , the play funk, disco and 50/60/70s music. If you like to hustle, this is a great place to be. Although the dance floor was small it was spacious enough to pull some moves. 

Beers were around $6.75 a pint. 

From what I here the tapas style Asian food was about. 3 but overpriced a little. They said some dishes were quite good. They said service was a 1 or 2, but don't have any specific stories. Also I notices empty plates were left alone for a long time. 

Super fun but skip dinner !

Oh, and theres absolutely no dress code here.  Shorts, Flip flops, sneakers, hats, t shirts. dress shirts whatever you please."}
{"text":"Supermarket is a hipster/student dance club. 

Let's brush the food aside, it's not great fusion cuisine by any stretch. It settles the hunger, but not the taste buds.

People come here for the dancing and chatting. It's not a bad place to meet new people. It's a great place to watch friends dance like they used to when they discovered NKOTB. In fact, the music is from around that era too, so it's fitting. I'm more of a top 40 kind of guy. I certainly enjoy my Drake and Pitbull, but I found Supermarket to be music tolerable.

It's a casual restaurant before 10:00pm and it goes ape shit after wards. I don't like getting repeatedly stepped on. The dance floor however, is full of trotting horses that are lost in their own world. But it's fun and funny at the same time.

Drink prices are regular priced and there are tables around to sit down after you've accumulated your fair share of bruises. 

Overall, the music isn't to my liking. It could be for you though. They're around 2 decades off for me. I also hate sprained ankles, they cramp my style. How do I shuffle if I have broken ankles? That is the question... that is the question..."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Kensington market?!

I checked out Supermarket this passed weekend and it was a hip place, maybe too hip for this non-hipster. They had live bands on Sunday night and had a great crowd.

My crew and I went for drinks and dessert. The menu is Asian Fusion and seemed to go well with the crowd... not wholly evident when you are outside of this place. As for dessert, I highly recommend the grilled pinapple, a little steep for the price but it had a great mix between the grilled pineapple, the home churned ice cream and this wafer/thin pie crust decor.

They could really hold off on all the mint leaf stylings. Added nothing to my dish.

Hipsters unite!"}
{"text":"We came here for a friends birthday and were pleasantly surprised! I checked in and got a discount pop up right away which made me happy! And much more willing to try a bunch of things from the menu. We came around 8 and the place was really nice and quiet, perfect atmosphere. Dimly lit and intimate atmosphere. Our service was very fast and the items were very reasonably priced with lots of choices for drinks. The food menu was short but not lacking options. I had the calamari which was good, and the curry chicken I believe which I also enjoyed but couldn't finish because I was sooo full. At the end, my bill was under $30 and I was full and happy. At around 10, however, this place gets extremely busy and crowded and loud. So if you're like me and prefer a quieter space then come here before 9 just in case!

Wasn't necessarily a 5 star experience but I'd definitely be back and would recommend!"}
{"text":"Performed here at the open mic, watched numerous shows here, had dinner/drinks with many different friends here over the past few years. Never fails to entertain me and whoever I'm with. It's a huge plus that it is literally the entrance to Kensington Market. For food only had stuff like tacos and nachos but for pub fare it was pretty tasty. Sometimes they got good beer prices when they feature. And the shows they have playing are awesome and chill. See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"A friend organized a little get-together at Supermarket on my suggestion.  I like the general vibe of Supermarket on the whole.

They gave us the whole front room for a party of about 12-14 which was very nice but lacked any atmosphere as it is kinda separated from the bar and general dining area imo.

Dishes of note that we ordered was the calamari (light and crispy), tuna tataki (great texture and flavour), and Guiness beef shank poutine (warm and filling).

Crowd is 25+ from my judgement and the dancefloor is quite generous for the size of the entire space.  There is live music on the weekends and the DJ rocks the house thereafter."}
{"text":"Located in the uber-chic and trendy Kensington Market area, SuperMarket offers a stellar combination of tasty food by day and killer dance tunes by night. 

I've enjoyed both food and fun here and I must say I was impressed every time. The menu is in the Asian fusion tapas style. We had some tasty spring rolls, beef satay and pad Thai. I was surprised at how tasty and flavourful the dishes were -  before eating here I thought it was just a hot club in Kensington! Boy was I wrong. There were also tons of other dishes on the menu that I will be sure to go back and try someday! 

As a nightclub, SuperMarket is the place to be. There's a small patio out front, indoor seating and a big old dancefloor to cut up all night long. The music is consistently amazing and the crowd is the kind that Kensington is famous for; an eclectic mix of hipsters, preppies and everything in between. 

It's a great place to go for a good meal and a great place to stay while you dance into the morning!"}
{"text":"Great good for a club! Great food for a restaurant! I was very impressed with the food, can you tell?

Went with a group of about 6 or 7 people, which was great, because we ordered a lot of dishes and got to try an assortment. Delicious asian-inspired tapas, with my favourites being the grilled calamari, the dumplings and the sauteed veg.

Our server was great. He knew the menu and was really nice, friendly and accommodating. Drinks were good too. I was very impressed.

So, for someone who thought of Supermarket as a club that served food, I now think of it as a good restaurant that turns into a club."}
{"text":"I always wondered where the girls who couldn't dance in high school would go to dance later on. It seems like Supermarket is their hangout! I've never heard so many 80's songs mixed in with old school R&B at a club but I have to say it was a lot of fun. Mostly because those girls felt right at home and started doing the sprinkler again (some even dared to push the shopping cart at Supermarket)!

But really, this was a really chill place to go dancing at night. Wide range of people, and most were non-douchy (including staff and bouncers) and everyone was having fun. Now to try some of their food!"}
{"text":"The Supermarket is definitely one of my favourite places in the city. Whether it is for dinner and drinks or just a night where you feel like dancing, this bar seems to offer it all.

Located in the heart of Kensington, it screams tons of character and has a unique theme, which includes shopping carts mounted to its wall inside the bar.

The Supermarket is great for birthday parties because you can make reservations, have a large and yummy group dinner there and stay for a full night of drinks, dancing and entertainment from their diverse list of DJs and live bands.

The food itself is good! The menu takes on an asian-fusion theme, where pad thai and beef shanks are staples. The prices are reasonable too!

Throughout the week, they tend to have themed nights in terms of the music they play and the entertainment they offer.

For example...I was there this past Saturday night and they were taking me back to the 1990s with tons of rock, dance and techno classics from my childhood.

Also,  this bar is a great venue for both! I have held my live music event here and it was a great set-up. The stage is in the back with the dancefloor, so there is always tons of energy coming from the audience.

I defintely recommend The Supermarket if you are looking for a bar with a unique yet warm feel, where it may be smaller but it is large with its personality."}
{"text":"I came here for a night of dancing with my girl friends. I joined them as they were eating their meals and from what I could tell, they all enjoyed the generous heaping they received. The one thing that struck me was how the server ignored me. He never offered if I wanted a drink! Luckily, there was water for the table & that quenched my thirst.

Shortly thereafter, the server came back to say the place was going to stop with the food service and turn into a club. That all drinks would be served from the bar. 

The clubby part is in the background of restaurant. It starts off with the melodies of disco past. I guess popular 70s music is how you get bums off seat? All in all, an uninspiring selection followed, gradually shifting to hip hop.

The dance floor also started becoming more active. Packs and packs of people and drunk people were dancing. It's all fun & games until a drunk girl starts crashing your table and feeling all your coats. Looking as if she's about to throw up on them. Then she randomly accuses you of stealing her coat while shes feeling up your coat! Her babysitter closely monitoring the situation and apologizing for her. The sisterhood is all united for women, until there is a drunk girl. Then it becomes a one woman power struggle bordering on senseless violence! Eventually, she is persuaded that her coat is not there and leaves but not without causing a scene.

By midnight, the dance floor is packed with bodies grinding to the best of late 90s and early 2010s hip hop and rap. Not my scene. End of scene."}
{"text":"Always here on those weekend nights when you can't find anywhere else to linger. 

The food here is actually pretty dope. Had the steak and it was actually played quite nicely. The taste isn't mind blowing, but I'm honestly not complaining! It's always crowded here, so either make a reso, or come at an awkward time for food. 

As for their later hours, the bar has never failed to impress me. I've gone more than three times and each time I've always had fun. They have a split bar/dance floor in the back with a live band or either a honestly amazing playlist. 

This is the place I always default to if I want to have a good time in the evening (there's $5/10 cover!)."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. It used to be so much better, the club at least. In terms of restaurant service, it's terrible. I arrived with a group of friends and sat at a table. No one came to give us menus or take our orders for 30 minutes, even when we switched tables. We had to flag a bartender and wait more for a server. When the server did finally show up, whom we flagged from our table, I informed her that I was upset with the service. Instead of providing us with menus or taking our orders, she questioned us as to who our server was because a friend who arrived earlier than us had a beer with him. She kept pressing us, asking who had served us even though it was irrelevant. She then walked away and another server came to provide us with menus after 10 minutes. There was no manager available that I could discuss my concerns with. Our food also took longer than usual to arrive."}
{"text":"We were in need of a patio and couldn't find anywhere without an hour or so wait, so we decided to check Supermarket out. I had only been here late night for drinks and dancing, so wasn't sure what to expect.

The menu is tapas style, although half of the menu i am not sure how you would share (pulled pork sandies, pad thai, etc.). I had the green curry and it was surprisingly good, they used a lot of different veggies (and more than straight up thai spots). 

The drinks were good and well priced. I was definitely into the 7 dollar mojitos. The patio was nice, although had a big sinkhole my friend nearly bailed into with her chair - they gotta patch that up!

Overall, decent food, good drinks and well priced."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with some co-workers for dinner. Ordered the \"thai basil shrimp with chilies & julienned vegetables tossed with a sweet soy sauce.\" It was okay. It wasn't that amazing. However, many of my co-workers ordered the \"grilled Argentinian styled steak with chimichurri dressing and matchstick potatoes on roasted mushroom salad with a balsamic vinaigrette\" - consensus was that it was amazing! I tried some too - and really enjoyed it. I would really recommend the \"grilled chimichurri calamari with balsamic reduction & olive oil.\" Great place to have tapas and share a great tasting dinner with friends. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"Great bar (goofy name) with excellent coffee, and performance space in back.


Supermarket is a bar, with fancy bar foods.

Went here to pound some tasty brews and listen to poets on the backroom stage prophecy competing versions of future utopias/apocalypses... also discovered that this place makes exquisite late-night espresso... and once the cat was out of the bag, everyone in my 12 person party was ordering espresso to the bartender's great chagrin! I hoped a juicy tip would smooth things over ... another mea culpa if it didn't... really enjoyed the coffee/beer/bar and top-notch service even if we were making your night feel like hell."}
{"text":"This is one of the staples in Kensington market and for that reason it is usually packed on a Friday or Saturday night. I meet up here with some friends on Friday for a couple of drinks and some dancing. The DJ are pretty good here and the dance floor is usually packed. 

If you are looking for a place to have a good time Supermarket should be on your list."}
{"text":"Good food, strong drinks,  eclectic crowd, beautiful people and the best open mike night in the city. 

Sunday nights at the Supermarket are fantastic."}
{"text":"Share and share alike. The sweet potato chips and beef chimichuri plates were the highlights. Solid value and style with substance. Nice back room area for events ( we attended the fundraiser for Charlie Angus.) Great sound system. Kensington Market area makes it more utilitarian and less posh, but this place could hang with the best of Yorkville food establishments and still out shine most."}
{"text":"My friend and I loved this place. When you first walk in we were a little discouraged because the place looked a little run down, but we stayed because the place was referred to us as a \"must eat\". We were happy that we stayed as everything we ate was spectacular from the dumplings to the salad. 
     The Resturant also hosts live music and the band was setting up while we were eating; however, we didn't stay for the show because we were tired after a long day. 
     If you've ever been to New York City's Greenwich village and enjoyed yourself, then you'll love this place as the neighborhood is very similar."}
{"text":"The place has evolved a lot over the years and it's still not quite hit the mark just as yet, but i think that's what i like about Supermarket. It's maintained this tiny bubble of imperfection-perfection that truly affords it a spot in kensington (which is obviously being gentrified like yorkville went through in the 70's). 

When it first opened, you didn't think food when you thought of supermarket. You thought about what unique music set/production/show they have going on this week. Everything from live jazz, to hard house, to classical brazilian. It was like a kinder surprise going to Supermarket. 

Then it got too popular for it's own good. Line ups all the time and charm diminished. Then the hipsters took over. And in that transition, they figured out food would also make them money. So they turned the place into resto lounge during the day, serving interesting but not exceptional food. 

Today, the place is ignored by the locals, forgotten by the 905ers, dismissed by the hipsters, and so what you have left is a spot that is frequented by a new yuppy crowd for dinner looking for something different, and music sets that attract a specific type of crowd. So Supermarket no longer has it's regulars. It's in a sense in another period of redefining itself. 

But the fact still remains - this is a place that has evolved, succeeded to exist in a tough transition. It's always going to have a great space, a great stage and a great location....and maybe one day some really great food too."}
{"text":"Been here a few Sunday nights for the live music and it's really good. 

As far is the place is concerned, we've done mostly drinks there. Pick up your drinks at the bar and hang out for a good time. You can sit far from the stage to actually be able to chat with friends without shouting. If you want to get into the music, you can in the performance area."}
{"text":"The food is decent.  (That said, there are much better restaurants in the neighbourhood).

The service is not good.  We asked to take some food home and our waiter came and dropped a box on the table.  We did our own packaging.  Service industry minus the service."}
{"text":"There are so many delicious options on Supermarket's izakaya portion of their menu, you'll rightfully want to try a bit of everything. Unfortunately though, you'll need a large posse (or pair of stretchy pants) in order to be able to taste more than a couple dishes. Unlike a traditional izakaya, the price points are a little too high and the portion sizes too large - both factors that can inhibit you from getting any real variety.

So izakaya it is not, but the food is great regardless. It took me forever to narrow down my selections, but the cute little crispy calamari rings with more creamy than spicy chipotle mayo ($7.95) and Thai green mango salad with two measly tiger shrimp, basil and cilantro in a satisfyingly spicy chili vinaigrette ($8.95) were both intensely flavourful. My brunch mate's humongous Mexican topping'ed lamb burger ($9.95) with cheese ($1.50) was also great and so delightfully juicy that it ran down his arms.

I so wish that I didn't have to wait until next time to try everything else, but whether I come back with a big group or conquer the dishes a couple at a time, the entire tasty menu will be mine."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and pretty good food. Very relaxing and super chill place. They have live music all the time. And open mike night is awesome."}
{"text":"Got there at opening on a nice day wanting to sit on the patio, but it was closed (with no reason or apology given, only a shocked look that we even had the audacity to ask).  The place looks a little rundown on the inside and a bit of a hipster vibe on the outside. Despite having a bunch of staff working and being the only customers there, service was slow. Food was decent, but not worth it compared to the large variety of places nearby that are both tasty and have proper service. Was about $60 for a dinner for 2.

Apparently it turns into a club/dance party if you stay long enough, but we didn't."}
{"text":"I came here for the drinks not the cuisine and wasn't expecting much from the menu, but I was blown away by the quality of the food, mostly tapas style offerings. The tacos especially are inexpensive, filling, and delicious (though make sure you ask for corn tortillas rather than flour). The music was also great. All in all, this place is far superior than the overpriced and mediocre Trinity Common across the street."}
{"text":"A spacious multifunctional bar-resto-dance floor in Kensington Market. Can't comment on food here but came for a birthday party and it was a no-more-than-3-stars level of fun. $5 cover, DJ, sticky dance floors, 20-30's crowd. Nothing special."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen I present to you my review by numbers...

27- my new age at midnight. Woot woot!

30- the number of minutes it took the manager to call me back personally and confirm my reservation

23- the number of friends I had present at dinner

2- the number of tables our group had to use... sadly we were separated

1- the number of people who's orders were completely forgotten!

3- the number of times I had to ask for extra utensils at our table

1- the number of bills we got for all 23 people... yikes!

12 (am)-  the time it was when the good music started to play

45- the number of minutes my friends (who didn't come to dinner) waited in line to get into the club  portion before they gave up and went home)

In the end I had fun but I wouldn't suggest this place for a super large group."}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for Supermarket for some reason. I guess a lot of fun dance nights as well as delicious meals will make you super loyal to a place.

They host fun nights, they have a great venue with a cozy seating area in the front, a stage in the back, a decently sized dance floor, CLEAN WASHROOMS (!!!) and a hot patio in the summertime. Food here is actually amazing -- I was pleasantly surprised and continue to love their food every time I've been back.

If I can recommend the perfect scenario to you, it involves a summer day spent perusing Kensington, and a lunch/dinner stop at Supermarket, then a return there later in the evening for a dance party, and you're set. Grab a late night slice and it's the best night ever."}
{"text":"This place has little star power. 

Although it's been around since 2004, Supermarket is a perfect example of the changes that have been happening to Kensington for quite a while now. This place is ridiculously expensive. But I guess majority of the stores on Augusta are.  Kensington Market is transitioning into Yorkville -- going from hippy to hipster to high-end. And it sucks, but that's just how it is. Neighbourhoods develop, evolve and change, I guess. *Sob*

And yes, the food is good. But the portions are tiny. You can't even fill the appetite of a newborn baby with those portions. I like that the chef has his own space at the bar and you can spy on him while he makes your food. I know I sound like Debbie Downer, but I don't like the bar. It's so high and as a self-proclaimed midget (5'2), I feel like one of Santa's little helpers when I'm ordering a drink! :(:( 

I ordered a pitcher of sangria yesterday. Silly me, I didn't ask about the price. I watched the bartender make it and I almost died. No fruit. He threw in two, sad little cherries. Not real cherries, but the cherries that you find in No Frills packaged Birthday cakes. The worse was yet to come. I settled my bill straight away and the total -- for the sangria alone -- came to $28. WTF. I was so so so angry. If you're going to charge me 30 bucks for a shitty, fruitless pitcher of sangria, at least throw in a free appetizer OR A SMILE... Ugh.

At least Supermarket has a nice patio. There are shopping carts on the outside and plenty of room in between tables so you're not conscious of  other people. The music is also great. In fact, I love the music they play. I've been here a few times and each time, the thing that pulled me in and made me stay longer, was the muzak. 

In the back, beside the washrooms, there's a big open space with a stage and seating. I've seen people reading excerpts from their short stories there or putting on plays. It's a cute venue for performing."}
{"text":"I don't go to many open mic's, but I can say the Super Market's Sunday night is one of the finest ones. Great place to eat, drink, socialize, and listen to live music."}
{"text":"WORSE BOUNCER EVER - My fiance and I were visiting Toronto from Philadelphia and after dinner, we wanted to stop somewhere and have a drink. We tried to go here and the bouncer started asking my fiance how many drinks he'd had tonight's out of nowhere...???... Seriously we were coming from dinner!!! I don't know about the service inside because I didn't want to go in after that. But if the door guy asks like that I can't expect much from the place!!!"}
{"text":"I have never ate here so I can't comment on the food but it is a fun place to dance.  The back of the bar is a large dance floor that is busy but never crushed.  The front half converts from dinning to a causal lounge for drinks where the music is distant enough off to easily hold a conversation.  Skews younger lately - moving from a 30s crowd to a crowd mostly in their 20s"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  I had the house red and was surprised it's served in a regular glass cup, not a wine glass. but oh well, it's still good wine.  Ordered the mango salad with shrimp.  It's a small dish for $10.  My fellow friend had the burger and he wasn't impressed with it either.  I'd come back still to try other things on the menu but will need to be prepared that it's nothing spectacular compared to other restaurants in the area.  

Overall, it's an okay place."}
