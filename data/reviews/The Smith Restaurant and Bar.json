{"text":"Love this place, great food, efficient and polite service. Too bad they just jacked up their menu prices though. $20 for a burger is a bit steep!"}
{"text":"2 stars because it takes some skill to be so perfectly mediocre ! I went for dinner at the Smith and all 4 of us were not too impressed by our meals. They weren't awful but we were disappointed in how \"meh\" they were. We went there to celebrate a birthday and ended up feeling bad that this person was being celebrated with such a dismal meal. The menu is laughable with multiple spelling errors and the pizza listed with appetizers. Feels like a red flag when even the paper menu is not done well? Staff are friendly enough but all in all I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We came in for a family dinner after we heard the food was fantastic. It looks like a higher end pub on the inside, but they cater to families with kids on the main floor which is great. The upper floor (I didn't get a chance to check it out) is the +18 bar area.  I must say that the staff and management are extremely friendly and attentive. Our server was always around making sure everyone had what they needed and one of the managers came over to check on us as well. Although this should be the norm, in most cases it is not, especially when you come in with children.  The food was good, but not great and not what I was hoping for. We did try our friend's appetizer ribs and they were delicious. My girlfriend and I shared the Hawaiian pizza as well as the mac & cheese. The mac & cheese was decent but not creamy enough and it came out only luke warm and once it cooled off the flavor disappeared. When it was warm it was tasty, but again, not delicious and not something I would order again. The pizza was pretty good but nothing super special about it. It had jalapenos which gave it a nice little kick but there was too much crust which obviously takes away from the toppings. The crust was good though but I still prefer more toppings over more crust. Try it with their house-made ranch. I also found the portion sizes to be pretty small. Maybe I was hungrier than I thought but I had half the pizza, half the mac & cheese, a rib and I still ate most of the fries from my girlfriends daughters kids meal. Her daughter had the chicken nuggets and fries kids meal. There was a generous helping of fries and an ok amount of chicken nuggets. It also includes a drink and ice cream for $10. An average price for a kids meal.  I may try The Smith again, but so far I'm undecided. If I do, it will be the service that brings me back, unfortunately not the food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The service is amazing, the music is great, and the food is out of this world! My favourite is the Return of the Mac and Cheese, but honestly, every meal I've had here has been spectacular."}
{"text":"Service is pretty terrible. Wait now. I didnt just go on a bad day. Ive been twice. It seems to be a thing. And as a falafel lover it was the first thing i tried. All i could do is laugh while i waited for the beer that never came."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Ordered drinks and waited over 20 minutes and still didn't receive them. Waitress just disappeared."}
