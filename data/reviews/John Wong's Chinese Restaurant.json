{"text":"Ordered food for pick up last week. I was very disappointed that they did not give us free dish for order of $50 or more. I have called twice to inquire for the free dish that I was supposed to get for free and the guy gave me shallow explanations thanks actually did not add up. At least he was polite enough however, very obvious that he was only trying to give me math reasonings that was not \"buyable\".  Food mediocre taste even on bland side. Price reasonable for the amount of dish and taste."}
{"text":"I have had lunch twice in the last two weeks, and their food is fresh & delicious. Yesterday our family of six had dinner with no complaints as the service was friendly and on the table in 20 minutes. Great neighbourhood, nothing fancy but fair prices for a quality meal."}
{"text":"Tuesday May 19th at 8:55pm a call was placed to this so called Resto.And recieve to most horrific service. The man was upset that I wanted to change my order and because I mentioned I wasnt happy with the soup the last time I ordered he freaked out. This guy was a joke, he argued with me about prices with their dinner for 2 menu when I was willing to pay the extra fees he just didnt want to count with his calculator. Anyways I asked for management and hung up on me and refused my service. I check their website and it seems its new management. Never again order from them, and showing up there would just involve police. Contact me if you have any issues joker."}
{"text":"Being our family's favourite Chinese takeout restaurant, I can't really say anything bad about John Wong's. The chicken fried rice is to die for! Vegetables are fresh and wonton soup is always pleasing. Service is quick. If you want Chinese food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Ordered 6 dishes for take out \"ready in 10 minutes\" they said. I thought \"wow\" till got it home and opened it up.  Chicken dish had pink chicken, not fully cooked Beef dish had mostly rare pieces except where they had folded over and were still raw Rice dish dried out and crunchy (chicken fried rice) and dangerous to your teeth hard pieces Pot stickers average Mixed veg had huge chunks of almost raw zucchini, broccoli, carrots and onions etc. had to get a knife as too big for chopsticks and too hard to cut with a fork   They need to slow down and cook the food, 20 min is fine with me as it would then not require me to wok it again at home and it might have some taste of a sauce  Only good thing was the deep fried wontons"}

{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.   I called, and was placed on hold and could hear the man who answered speaking to another customer on the other line, in a very rude, and short manner. At the end of their call he gave a total and said \"well, it'll be there when it's there, I have no idea.\" ...Then it was my turn: I requested to place an order, and he said okay what, as I gave my order he says \"-yup, -yup, -yup\" cutting me off every single time.. which okay, fine maybe it's busy. At this point I had already told another my husband to pick up another phone just to hear how rude this man was being. He then proceeds to YELL at me because he cannot hear me, as it sounded as if a group walked passed him, and told me \"I\" needed to call on a phone that worked (this was a landline I used). He then began to hear me as it was quiet in his background again, and when I told him the order was for delivery he told me alright well the food will be ready in 20 minutes but he had no idea when it would be delivered as he was going to wait out the rain. What?! Now, I could even maybe understand this if it were awful outside.. Such as hailing or severe in any way.. But I live within 2 kms of the restaurant, and it was lightly raining and windy, that was it. Between the way I was spoken to from the VERY beginning, to the downright rudeness at the end, there was no way I was going to load up my three small children in the car to give my money to this place. And for the record, I got in my car and went to Sunterra instead.. with my children, and I didn't even have my windshield wipers on beyond the first level. If a 3 year old can do it, you sir can too. Or...TRY respecting the customer. First and last time I ever try this place."}
{"text":"Okay so this place isn't were you go to test drive your taste buds or have an experience of gigantic proportions. But if you're driving home and need a quick grab of decent food at a reasonable price, it's always the same, always reliable.  And the owners are nice people. It's like a little family unit running the show and often times I will be a repeat customer at a place if I'm truly welcomed there.  Not good for a first date, but hey, if mom wants some quick Chinese (canadianized chinese) it's a pretty good spot."}
{"text":"John Wong's has great take-out and delivery. They have great deals like free dumplings on orders over a certain amount (I think $30). Whenever I want to order Chinese, this is where I order from.  The dumplings are absolutely amazing! You can't not get them. Trust me.  I read on a Google review that they had good hot & sour soup... Unless you are already a hot & sour soup fan, I suggest you avoid this.  Anyway, great service and great food. Love it."}
{"text":"Have been to the restaurant a couple times over the past few months. Food has been good. Staff has been friendly. No issues, now a good choice if you are looking for decent Chinese in the area."}
{"text":"I needed something to eat one afternoon before work, and I was just craving Chinese.  I drove past John Wong's and was immediately filled with hope.  Sadly, it wasn't the greatest experience I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant.  I waited for almost 5 minutes before someone came out to seat me and take my order, and the place empty.  By the time they got to me I had already flipped through a take-out menu and decided on what I wanted.  It didn't take long for them to bring me my beef chop suey and vegetables with black bean sauce, but it really shouldn't have since I was the only one in there.  The food was fine.  Not the absolute best, but fine.  Once I was finished it, once again, took them a while to bring me my cheque.  I felt bad giving a lower than normal tip, but I truly thought the service was crummy.  They've got the regular Chinese food deals: free delivery within 5km, free item with purchase over $30, dinner for one, two, three, etc.  I probably won't be stopping by John Wong's for my next lunchtime Chinese craving.  It just wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Typical everything deepfried and covered with extra msg kinda Chinese restaurant. Ordered dinner for two it was actually pretty decent although I was quite high on marijuana. Let's just say it's no Silver Dragon... but it'll do in a pinch thanks johnny"}
