{"text":"Had lunch there today. We have eaten here in the past, but today was exceptional. Everything was delicious and amazing. I had the enchiladas verde... So fresh and the best verde sauce. The sope with chorizo was the highlight though. The corn cake tortilla was crisp on the outside but moist and delicious on the inside with the spicy chorizo on top. Soooo tasty. The food seems as if it has improved from prior visits. I was very impressed. 

I also feel I have to add this... I am not the owner of this restaurant or any restaurants.. Yes, recently some dumb ass yelper messaged me and accused me of owning one of the restaurants I reviewed. Their message was harassing and intimidating.. So I am not in the restaurant business so please don't message me! Thank you! Oh and I contacted Yelp and they did nothing about it!"}
{"text":"Had a groupon, but still not worth it.  Service was bad, fly in the margherita, and the food was cold and tasteless."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Cuzamil for a while, considering I live right up the road. My husband and I went there during the week, and the place was pretty much empty. When we FINALLY got served I could see why. This was the first \"mexican\" restaurant I have been to that charges you for additional chips and salsa. I ordered a taco sampler, and was extremely excited to see tongue as a option. 2 out of the 3 tacos were bland, and the tongue taco was extremely chewy, meaning it hadn't been cooked properly. We both ordered margaritas and were given what tasted like a glass of margarita mix that someone forgot to add tequila to. I can understand how any restaurant can have a bad night, but i think Robert Irvine should be called in to redo this place or another restaurant should take the space. Will not be going back because there is much better mexican in Pittsburgh than this place."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever had.  We were the only folks there and the server seemed irritated we were there.  I didn't even eat my food- it looked like someone threw a bunch of dry chicken on a plate with some sauce.  I hardly ever see anyone in this place and I wonder how they are even still in business."}
{"text":"COCKROACHES IN FOOD! Do not eat here! We ordered take out and after I ate half of my meal, my boyfriend opened up his side order of rice and a live cockroach was walking around inside!!! I signed up for Yelp just to warn others! Must be a serious cockroach problem that a live cockroach was packed in a tight container without anyone noticing?! How does this even happen? I hope I don't have roaches in my house now! I have to go now and throw up...."}
{"text":"The food is good, especially for Pittsburgh. It is located conveniently on Murray. The owners are nice people.

I was frequenting their restaurant a lot after getting conned once stopped going there. It is usually the owner's wife serving herself but the last time I went there they had a new waitress. We were two people ordered 13 dollarish dishes each and two non-alcoholic beverages like Coke. We had a 40 dollar bill that came to us, but I could not remember what the exact prices were. We were like maybe it is with the tax and stuff. I asked her to double-check the charges she just smiled and brought it back. So, we payed it plus the tip. But I felt like this should not be what it costs and checked their menu online and I was right. Who enjoys being conned like that? Although I like their food, it happened to be last time I went there..."}
{"text":"Wow.  And this is by no means a good wow.  Went there with the boyfriend today and have to say Cuzamil did do something extraordinary.  It won the award for the absolute worst \"Mexican\" food I have ever put in my mouth.  

We went on a lazy Sunday afternoon, around 1:30, and we saw that they had some lunch specials.  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to try Mexican food in Pittsburgh because since I've been here...I haven't seen any.  The standard chips and salsa was blah.  The tortilla chips seemed (days?) old and were really cold.  The salsa was decent.  

My boyfriend ordered the pork carnita tacos and I am a huge fan of chili rellenos, and so I wanted to test them out here.  Big effin mistake.  A chili relleno (although there are variations of the rule) is a pablano pepper, with an egg battered crust, stuffed with cheese and meat.  This was an abomination of a chili relleno...a defected, ugly step-brother, if you will.  Instead, what I got was a thin slice of a GREEN BELL PEPPER, with a greasy, yellow mound of ground beef, and a 3 inch hunk of melted white cheese on top.  It was sitting, along with my rice and canned re-re-refried bean, on a pool of yellow grease.

Don't go there.  I beg of you.  My boyfriend and I made jokes after we left about how our stomachs were really mad at us and just wanted to be left alone for a while.

*Note - When paying the check I asked the waitress if the owner was Mexican.  She happily explained that he was and so was the kitchen staff. This pretty much says that they indeed know how to make proper food, but don't.  Probably because they know people won't notice or complain.  Or because the guy is really, really cheap.  Blah."}
{"text":"Too bad one does not have the option for NEGATIVE stars. Eat here if you are a masochist. The service was horrific. Our drinks were never refilled. I ordered 1 bar drink, an Almond Peach Margarita which was stunningly made improperly. It was saturated mainly with Peach Schnapps. It resembled a drink someone who knew nothing about bartending would conjure up.

Next was the CUZAMIL PLATTER. For 16.95 one gets the experience of Chef Gordon Ramsey's kitchen nightmare experience prior to the makeover. None of the food had ANY taste to it. If one wanted to make these items and left them sit in the fridge for 10 days, threw it in the broiler, laden with grease it would recreated this wretched experience. If my husband and I don't get food poisoning I will be shocked.

The fascinating aspect of this memorable experience was when the waiter (and I use this word lightly) came to remove my plates. He asked if I wanted my food wrapped as I barely eat it. My response was \"Absolutely not. I forced myself to eat as much as I could so I won't be hungry later. This food was horrific.\" His response was \"okay, so your ready for the check.\" Nuff said. The best part about this experience was leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"Comfort food for a Texan. As a transplant from Texas, I have been consistently frustrated by the Mexican restaurants in the northeast. Finally, I found one that tastes a lot like home! Took off one star because it's a tad pricey (though the portions are large). At home I would give it three to four, but context matters, y'all. In comparison, I would give any other Mexican restaurant I have tried in the northeast a two star review or less. I will be back and strongly suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"My family really likes this place for a wide variety of Mexican dishes. The servers are always friendly and the prices are good. I only give it 4 stars because I wish the food was a little spicier. We'll keep going though, because it's rare to find reliably good food and service at this price."}
{"text":"The service is always super friendly there and I like to get the Cuzamil platter & an old fashioned margarita.  It's not super-authentic, but it's always a pleasant experience.  The waitstaff remembers us & it's just a nice place to go if I'm in Squill and I'm not particularly craving Asian or Pizza."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but I think is overpriced for the way it's prepared. They charge 2 dollars for one oz sauce. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Went here because we had a groupon.  Not opposed to going back, but  would not make a special trip for to get there.   Chips seemed to be out of a bag, the salsa was tomatoes and salt--and a very small portion at that.   Entree portions were large, hot and tasty.  

I had the chilequiles, and had no complaints.  The chicken was done well and the sauce was nice and spicy like I like it.  Hubby had sampler of enchiladas, no complaints.  Daughter had veggie plate #4, and she thought it was good.  That's it, good--not great--no complaints!

Wait staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Underwhelmed. I don't think there actually was any tequila in my margarita."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best Mexican food I have ever tried.  Both my partner and I ordered vegetarian entrees and drinks.  For the quality that they churn out I would expect a bit lesser cost.  

The chips were good.  Hot and salty with fresh (I think) salsa.  It was a good start but it sort of ended there.  

The fajita could have been better.  The veggies were mostly peppers and onions.  It was hot but it was also a bit too greasy for my tastes.  The rice and beans were a bit dry (possibly undercooked beans) and the rice seems to have been out a bit too long.  

The burrito was also a bit bland.  Copious amounts of hot sauce were needed to eat it.  Perhaps the ingredients weren't fresh?  Perhaps it was an off night?

The drinks, although expensive, were strong and well mixed.  

In hindsight, I would have been better off going to Chipotle..."}
{"text":"Very authentic Mexican Food. Tamales were excellent and the Margaritas even though expensive were made with fresh lime juice. My wife and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Ok, TWO DOLLAR TACOS TUESDAYS.  So.  That's awesome. I've been here a couple of times and am always  really pleased.  I saw a review that mentioned dry spices/garlic powder, and I have not experienced that.  There has always been fresh cilantro and I've noticed finely chopped garlic, so I'm sure that isn't the case.  My favorite non, soft-flour taco is def teh verde enchiladas.  Oddly enough I've paid twice amount for enchiladas at Verde and been sorely disappointed, so Cuzamil wins that round.  Not that they are at all comparable atmosphere wise.  

Cuzamil is a slightly divey and homey feeling, they have pretty good selection of tequila but it is hardly displayed in any logical way.  The classic margaritas are 5 bucks and made with fresh squeezed lime juice, we watched her juice the limes right there at the bar.  Really good stuff.  I wish I lived closer bc a two dollar taco and 5 dollar margarita is pretty much my ideal weeknight dinner and all the servers are super friendly.  They disappear sometimes but they always come back in a reasonable amount of time.  I'm glad it's sticking on the end of Murray that has a high turnover."}
{"text":"I have no idea what is with the negative reviews for this place. Sure, the restaurant isn't much to look at, but their food is excellent! I've been there three times now, and it's never let me down.

Most recently, I went and got the combination with the two enchiladas and the burrito. So good! And it came out so fast! I got the burrito and one of the enchiladas with the shredded beef and one of the enchiladas with cheese. The cheese that they use is chihuahua cheese (from cows, not dogs) so it was nice and gooey and melty and delicious.

Also, every time I've been there, the servers have been sweet and attentive. Anyone complaining about bad service is clearly hallucinating.

In short, it's a little hole in the wall with great food. It's a little expensive, but it's great. Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant tonight with my boyfriend. I ended up only ordering a sangria so my comment is not gonna be on the food but on the service only. 

It took us at least 5 minutes to get our water. Then we waited another couple more minutes to get Cindy - the waitress/ owner - to order our food. 

I happened to check my phone after placing our order, and it was 9:06pm. We got our food at 9:21pm. During this 15 minutes wait, no one ever checked on us or anything. 

Before coming we purchased a $10 for $20 coupon on LocalFlavor. But when we showed this coupon to Cindy before getting our check, she told us that SHE WAS TOLD that this coupon is only applied for some \"two-person dining\". And when we asked her what exactly two person dining was she said something like we need to order two entree or something. I can't remember what exactly she said but her point was we couldn't use our coupon. The price wasn't ridiculous so we were fine paying with cards. 

But then I went back to the website where we purchased the coupon and there was not a single word about this \"2 person dining\". So I decided to talk to the owner about this. Not to get our money back but to find out what exactly is happening. We asked Cindy who the owner was and guess what? SHE IS THE OWNER HERSELF. So what was the \"I was told that this coupon can only apply to two person dining\". Told by whom?! 

My boyfriend was nice enough not to complain to the owner but instead telling her to put that \"two person dining only\" thing on the coupon website so that what happened to us won't happen to the next customer. But I feel like I need to share my terrible experience with other potential customers so for whom care about quality of services can avoid this place. 

And if the restaurant can see my comment hopefully they want to improve what has upset their customers.  

Happy holidays to whoever is reading my review."}
{"text":"I tried the chiles rellenos again and the covering and sauces were both normal this time.  Since chiles rellenos are my favorite, and they've learned how to make them right in the past 7 months, they get an extra star.  However, they jacked up the prices and 2 chiles rellenos with rice and beans now costs an absurd $14.50.  The food's good but entirely too expensive."}
{"text":"I can't say this place is bad because it's not.  It's just not that good, either.  We had the steak tacos and the chicken mole yesterday and it was just \"meh.\"  Edible but that's about it.   I will say that the medium Margarita was pretty big and tasty and the mohito I had was really good.  The service was relatively good but the food was just uninspired.  I don't think we'll go back."}
{"text":"The food is eatable, although it tends to fall heavily on your stomach. Fairly mediocre overall, although not disgusting. 

But why, why do the waiters feel the need to clean the table in the small space with very strong cleaning products while you are eating? why? This says a lot about the way they view the quality of their own food."}
{"text":"Good beans! The tostada was five star. The salsa was so so. The chips were excellent. I did not care for the sauce on the enchiladas; but stick with bean and chip oriented food and you will delighted. I was not expecting much but liked the food better than Mad Mex or Old Mexico. The atmosphere is not great but I would go back and order tostadas!"}
{"text":"it could be that I was extra hungry but I thought the food here was okay.  the price of the meals is a little high so split between 2 people and after chips and salsa, it should be plenty.  it's not my favorite mexican (far from it) but it's a cute place with a kick back atmosphere (the bar area).  they should have a happy hour to lower some prices on beers and appetizers.  oh and pass on the guacamole dip (not good)."}
{"text":"Not sure if we just went on an off night or what but service was pretty slow. Some friends and I went and waited over an hour for food. Friends ordered vegetarian fajitas and you could clearly tell the food had been sitting out for a while. Tops were cold. They also didn't bring what seemed like enough tortillas for their food, and were going to charge extra for them!

I had soft tacos and there wasn't really much to them. 

Overall I wasn't impressed and despite so many good reviews I've had a bad experience and won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"So, I used to think this place was reasonable.  Being from California, I've missed good Mexican food so much that I sometimes find myself saying things like, \"Maybe Chipotle really isn't that bad...\" or things like that.  And for a while, Cuzamil kept me from tearing my hair out when all I wanted was some greasy, hole in the wall Mexican food.  Cuz when I say I want Mexican, that's what I want - not the fresh ingredient gourmet stuff that they serve at Cantina, but the greasy spoon stuff that is dirt cheap and is essentially what you are craving after a good night out on the town.  I'm not talking foodie stuff here.

Anyway, so Cuzamil used to satisfy that for me.  But I went recently and man was that pretty bad.  I ordered the enchiladas especiales, which were supposed to come with avocado salad (which is really the only reason I got it).  What I got were two enchiladas that were gooey, tasteless, the tortilla was chewy and clearly stale... and no avocado salad.  I asked about it, and the server came back and said they didn't have any avocado.  So... lemme get this straight.  You don't have a major ingredient, and you're not going to ask the patron if they want to change their order?  AND you're going to charge them as though they got the entree they wanted, rather than two lifeless enchiladas, which are much cheaper?  Someone's business radar was clearly broken.

So, sure I'm a little bitter.  But given that I wasn't super hot on this place before, this little incident ensures that I'm not going back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I eat here often. We love the food and margaritas! I recommend the veggie super quesadillas. Cindy and her family are very friendly!"}
{"text":"For being in a prime location, the food was no better than ok.. unfortunately. It wasn't busy but our order of food was taken to another table and then was given back to us. 

 We had the tacos and tamales. And only one word can describe it, FROZEN (tamales for sure!). Eh.. the food just left much to be desired.  

On a positive note, the drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food..and they ran out of beans and tortilla.and your a mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Meh. The food was better than expected based on the look of the place inside. Trust me, I am not snobby about the interior of a restaurant and never judge the food based on appearance but there was just something about the inside that was not welcoming/ not totally pleasing aroma / slightly smelly. 

We decide to order a few things off the \"sides\" section to kind of make our own platters and that seemed to throw the waiter off...however, the way it is presented, that didn't seem like it would be a problem. My companion had the shrimp tacos and I ordered 1 chorizo taco, one chicken quesadilla, and a side of rice. 

I trust servers so I don't get mad when they don't write my order down. I do get slightly annoyed when they don't write it down and then it comes out wrong. Instead of the chorizo taco, I ended up with a shrimp one. It looked really fresh and tasty, but I don't eat shrimp so I didn't touch it. I'm sure they would have fixed it if I asked but the rest of the meal filled me up so I decided just to take it to go for the human garbage dump, aka BF. 

Food was fresh but nothing to write home about. The rice was dry and didn't have much flavor. The do give you free chips and salsa which is a huge plus in my book. 

I'll stick with Los Cabos in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"The best Mexican restaurant in the area. The taste of food above and beyond anything you've tried in big chain restaurants. It really feels like home made. The size of plates are huge so there is always some food left for later. The drinks that owner makes is just outstanding! My favorite is Almond Peach Margarita with perfectly balanced all the ingredients. Is you what to enjoy your meal and treat your rate buds Cuzamil is a no brainer."}
{"text":"Walked in at 11:30.  Tables still dirty from days before (closed xmas).  No one appeared to seat me.  Left for hopefully a better experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was the WORST experience ever. I purchased a Groupon for a lunch special and the waitress refused to honor it.  She told me that I was required to have 2 people present in order to redeem the voucher---this was not true.  The voucher said that I needed to order 2 entrees.  It said nothing about needing 2 people.  She was stubborn, ignorant of the Groupon deal, and unwilling to serve me.  I reported the restaurant to Groupon, and they said that they have reported the incident internally.  A review may be underway if other Groupon customers have additional unsavory experiences.  I obviously can't tell you about the food, but the service was really awful! Buyers beware!"}
{"text":"I don't want to turn this into a commentary on the sad state of Mexican food in Pittsburgh... but I don't know, man. It's like the city as a whole has just shrugged it off and moved on with their lives.

Not that Cuzamil is terrible. It's just, if you're gonna spend $12-15 on an entree, you want to feel like it's worth it. If you order a pitcher of sangria, you don't expect to find canned fruit at the bottom of your glass. You know what I mean? As if there's a mindset that the people of Pittsburgh just won't notice. Rise up, Squirrel Hill! Demand better! Or just stay quiet, and pass me one of your soggy fish tacos."}
{"text":"Terrible experience there today. I got our food to go, and it was packaged improperly. Refried beans got all over everything-- everything in the same bag and my vehicle. The lettuce on the tacos de carne asada was cooked, and the chorizo cheese dip was atrocious. The container was quite literally half filled with orange grease. It was disgusting. It's sitting, uneaten, on my counter right now, and I paid $4 for said dip.  Finally, most of the food was too salty to eat.  I was never head-over-hills for this place, but now I will never go again."}
{"text":"Great location, horrible food, nothing here made us happy. Worst chips ever, artificial margarita, bland food

Mexican food my ass!

Patron and Emiliano's are much better, so is Taco Bell"}
{"text":"I had heard some really great things about this place and was excited to check it out. Overall, I was disappointed. The food was okay (I've experienced far better - seemed a lot like \"American Mexican\") - but the service was awful. Our waitress couldn't keep anything straight, and was also super awkward. I don't think I'll be coming back - you can find better food and definitely better service."}
{"text":"Rice and cheese. That's basically what I got when I ordered my meal. It was supposed to be a burrito. Instead, I got a tortilla opened with a miniscule amount of meat inside and a plethora of rice and cheese (not even good cheese, at that). The chips were cold but the salsa was room temperature (not sure if that's how people eat it, but usually it's the other way around). 

The prices were also confusing, as I had expected most of the meals to be under $10. Alas, I was hard-pressed (read: not able) to find any meal under $12 and that was for a meal that was leaning towards an appetizer.

The only happy experience my mouth--and wallet--had was that the waiter forgot to charge me for my Dos Equis."}
{"text":"I really, truly like this spot for legit Mexican food.  I know it's not the easiest thing to come by in Pittsburgh, and even tougher if you're sticking to the city limits, but Cuzamil hasn't disappointed me yet.

Our first visit was actually the daring decision of going to a tiny little Mexican spot on Cinco de Mayo last year.  Natually, it was packed to overflowing, but everything about our trip was excellent.  The service has always been great, even when we were elbow-to-elbow with our fellow Cinco-de-Mayo-ers.  Any time there was a delay in our food reaching us, we were informed, and the servers were on top of refills (of drinks and chips) to tide us over.

And there's something about their homemade margarita pitchers that gets me each time.  There's that tiny bit of bite in each sip that separates it from the average margarita.

I do fear that I get the same thing every time I go here, which is the chicken quesadilla.  It's gigantic, and comes with the little Mexican food salad (the shredded lettuce/sour cream/guac/pico mix), beans, and rice.  It's easily enough for my meal and leftovers the next day, and I like getting that value for my money.  I always want to try other things that catch my eye on the menu, but I seem to keep coming back to this massive quesadilla.

The chips and salsa are homemade as well, and on our latest visit, we tried the appetizer platter that came with mozzarella sticks.  I know cheese sticks are not really what come to mind when you hear \"Mexican food,\" but they had a little bit of zest to them that made it okay in my book.  There was something reminiscient of the composition of the fresh, crispy homemade chips in the cheese stick breading.

Each time we've gone, the service has been great.  On Cinco de Mayo, everyone dining at the restaurant got to pick trinkets out of a bag of Tecate swag.  I got one of those little dresses for your beer bottle, in the design of a traditional Mexican poncho (with Tecate emblazoned across the front, of course).  It's the little details like that, plus the top-notch service and delicious food that keeps me coming back.

Also, look for deals in Clipper magazine or Groupon.  They don't count for the margaritas, but everything else on the menu is fair game!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch as I was craving a taco. The hard shell was stale and I wasn't impressed with the rest of it. The salsa that comes out had no flavor, it seemed to just tomatoes. Booooring and tasteless. 

I will probably not be going back to see if it was a bad day as stale hard taco shells and flavorless salsa at a Mexican joint seems like blasphemy! 

This is sad face in the flesh. :("}
{"text":"Tried this place on the way home tonight , Food was ok . Nothing to recommend , I got the combo plate and you have to pick what you want on your plate and what type of meat. Kinda cool I guess. The wait was very very long and the food was not what I had ordered. Our waitress was attentive and friendly so I gave her a good tip. I'm just not impressed . 
I agree with Monigue B.  ( \" Better than Taco Hell \" )"}
{"text":"New Year's Eve and not busy at all.  Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

Turned out to be a good thing!  

Take this with a grain of salt (and a margarita, if you wish), but I don't go to many Mexican restaurants so I may not be the best to ask...but I liked it!

The sangria was great, and my friend had a margarita, which he said he enjoyed. 

I got the taco platter - which I customized into 2 carnita hard tacos and 1 ground beef hard taco.  I don't like rice and beans (which is why I frequent Mexican restaurants so little...as that is their 'go to' side) so I asked if I could substitute out for corn bread or fries.  After telling me 'no' (sadface), she wound up bringing fries after all!  

(ok, so they were fries at a Mexican restaurant: not that good...but they were better than beans!)

The tacos were very good.  I was especially surprised that the ground beef wasn't greasy and runny, which is the case of nearly every other ground beef taco I've eaten (both at restaurants and homemade...I don't know how beef just seems to absorb grease and then leak out onto your arm as you eat it).  The carnitas beef was good too.  My tacos were just great - I'd say some of the best I've ever had.  

My husband got the California burrito, which I was eyeing up because it came with a side of cornbread.  Because I'm his wife and he can't hate me forever, I helped myself to some of it and it was also very good.  Cornbread is something I do know, and I know Mad Mex's cornbread is wet, blue (?!) and gloppy.  THIS was some good cornbread. 

Overall, great experience, and a low-key restaurant for a quiet New Year's Eve.
I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I have been for dinner three times and enjoyed my meal each time.  The first time I got the beef chimichangas which were very good.  I also really like the rice that came with them.  The second time I got the sopes which were also good.  It was nice because you got a beef, a chicken and a chorizo sope.  I ate the chicken and chorizo there and took the beef home for lunch the next day.  All were very good, I couldn't really say which I liked the best but it was very nice to have a variety.  The next visit I got the chimichangas again but got a beef and chicken, again very good but I liked having one of each.  The chimichangas are topped with a nice cheese sauce and come with lettuce, guacamole and sour cream.  My companions ordered one of the combinations which I am going to try next time.  I really loved their salsa it tastes very fresh and is so tasty.  The waitress/owner is also very nice and sweet.  She remembered us from our previous visits and is very flexible on the orders."}
{"text":"It was a late night and the wait staff let us in. I was really happy to come across a Mexican restaurant that was so close. I was a bit apprehensive due to the 2-1/2 star rating, but the excessive traffic due to tunnel closings made my normal go-to-Mexican restaurant out of the question. We were promptly seated and ordered the following.

White Cheese Dip
Tacos de Carne Asada: no pico de gallo; no rice
Steak Quesadilla
Chorizo Quesadilla
Taco: meat and cheese only

We were brought the obligatory salsa and chips and told by the server that the white cheese dip was out. No big deal, we will deal without. We were happy they let us in. I tried some of the chips and salsa and was a tad put off by the fact that the salsa tasted like it was made without love. There was garlic powder in the salsa. Who uses dried spices in salsa? Not only was there garlic powder, there was TOO MUCH garlic powder.  I decided to wait on the entrees to arrive.

When our entrees arrived, I was happy to see that the food looked appealing. I was sad that there was lettuce on the tacos de carne asada, but that was my own fault for not paying attention. I put some tomatillo sauce on and ate one of them. I was not excited. The meat was very greasy and flavorless. The tomatillo sauce tasted like it just came out of a bottle. I took a bite of the beans and they were undercooked; they were slightly crunchy. I was not having a good time. I tried some of the chorizo quesadilla and was hit by an overwhelming amount of cumin and paprika -- not a good chorizo. 

I decided to finish my tacos de carne asada and move on. The best tasting part of the meal was the beef from the taco, but it was not very vibrant and it tasted like the seasoning that comes from the grocery store. I really wanted to like Cuzamil due to it's proximity, but it just doesn't work. In the future, I will go to Gran Agave when tasting Tex-Mex or Mexican and Los Cabos when tasting Cali-Mex. Both of these other restaurants give you more food, greater and better flavor, and are lighter on the pocketbook.

I won't return."}
{"text":"Went in at 3 on a Saturday afternoon. Was pretty quiet. The chips and salsa you get to start were excellent. I put a couple dashes of the green hot sauce in to spice it up, and it was perfect - very good flavor. I got the chicken a la planche, which was fantastic. Typical Mexican beers on tap. A very good experience with nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"I was very concerned to try this restaurant after seeing its Yelp reviews but I decided to give them a try to meet my friend for a Friday night dinner. However, though my company was enjoyable, I'm sad to say that it definitely met and exceeded my very low expectations...

1. At times, it was hard to communicate with the hostess/waitress as she spoke minimal English. She had to call her young grandson to run our credit cards as she was not able to run them herself.

2. The decor, tables, and chairs were very shabby and not helped by the fact that the restaurant was also quite dirty. The hostess stand and surrounding area had stacks of papers and letters and added to the general messiness of the environment. 

3. The restaurant was very quiet and open which felt like you were having a group dinner with the few other people in the space. I didn't feel that I could speak freely without someone overhearing me.

4. The bartender was not working so they were NOT SERVING MARGARITAS. I almost died. I had been looking forward to a margarita all day (if not for days) and considered diving over the bar and fixing up one myself.

5. When the hostess/waitress woman delivered our chips and salsa, she noticed that one of the plates had a dot of dried food on it and PROCEEDED TO CHIP OFF THE FOOD WITH HER FINGERNAIL AND HAND ME THE PLATE. I almost died. Again. Thinking of the moment makes my stomach turn.

6. The food was fine -- just your typical Mexican restaurant fare -- but definitely would've tasted better if I had been consuming a margarita simultaneously.

Needless to say, I will not be returning to Cuzamil."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this restaurant has gotten such a low rating! My brother and I came here for a late lunch and the food was hot and very well seasoned. I can't remember what my brother ordered, but I got one of the combination platters. I enjoyed my taco. I sampled the other food on my plate, which was also good but the taco filled me up and I took the rest home. Service was great and I recommend coming here for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"We all got food poisoning. We ordered sopas, burritos, and tamales. None of us shared our food."}
{"text":"Had a groupon so we checked this out. It was the best Mexican food we have had in Pittsburgh, but it was too expensive. Most of the dishes were $12-14, which feels like too much for basic Mexican food, at least to me. If it was a few dollars cheaper, we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"Cuzamil is OK.  The food, the selection, the service, the ambiance, and pretty much everything about the place is not bad, but not fantastic either.  If you want Mexican food and are in the area, you can walk in unafraid, but it's not worth a separate trip."}
{"text":"There's a few Cuzamils in every city - simple restaurants with very predictable Mexican food.  There's nothing wrong with that, but there's nothing particularly exciting about it either.

We were trying to go to Sababa, but it was closed for Passover, so we ducked in to Cuzamil instead.  The interior is very simple - some decorative items and a TV.  I didn't see any booths, only tables.  Our server was really friendly and generally cheerful, so that was a big place.

She recommended the Poblanos Chiles Rellenos, which I tried.  They were pretty much what I expected - served very hot, with gooey cheese.  The chicken was surprisingly good and pretty tender.  The rice and beans on the side were hot.  Our server got us some hot sauce which was much needed, as the dishes themselves didn't seem to have too much spice.  My boyfriend got the chimichanga, which he enjoyed.  The food was heavy, saucy, and cheesy - just what you expect from most Mexican-American restaurants.  Prices were a bit higher than I'd hoped - the food is fine, but also uninspired and leaves a brick feeling in your tummy.

Chips and salsa were pretty plain too - the salsa was sort of saucy, lacking the tasty tomato and pepper chunks that normally give it texture.  Margaritas tasted okay but were very weak - I didn't even feel a buzz, which was a bummer!

I'll give it three stars since the server was so nice, and there was nothing wrong with the food, it was pretty much average across the board.  It's a good place to have in the neighborhood if you get a Mexican craving.  Still, it's places like this that make me long for the taquerias and fresh, authentic Mexican food you can find in Chicago."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's better than Taco Hell. 

There were two servers working the dining room. The woman server was fantastic and very attentive. The male server seemed more interested in doing literally everything else besides waiting on our table. 

My dining companion got the shrimp fajitas. For my meal I chose al pastor, carnitas, and beef tongue. 

The al pastor was phenomenal, the beef tongue had good beef flavor but literally no seasoning whatsoever on it, and the carnitas were horrible. Not only was the pork flavorless, but it was dried out to the point of shards. Not delicious shredded pork, but SHARDS OF MEAT. Highly unacceptable. The only reason I didn't send the item back was because it took about 40 minutes for our order to come out and there was no way I was going to wait for them to fix it. Oh, and this place uses flour tortillas, iceberg lettuce, and cheese in their tacos. Not authentic and will never order again. 

Shrimp fajitas were solid. Shrimp was a little overdone but had a good sauce on them (a bit too saucy, but my dining partner liked it). Rice was a dry and but the refried beans were decent. 


I still can't tell if the salsa was made fresh or not. If not, then it was pretty tasty jarred stuff.
Id try this place again but certainly wouldn't go out of my way to make it a priority. It has potential, it just seems to need to work out some kinks in service and food prep."}
{"text":"Graded on these questions:
1)  Was the place inviting? --- Not particularly.
2)  Was the service good? ---- Just so-so.
3)  Was the food good? -- just so-so.

Maybe a 2.5 but definitely not a 3 star rating.  There just wasn't anything about the place or food that makes you want to have a return visit when there are so many other options, especially in Squirrel Hill and especially on Murray Ave.  

To the management, all you have to do is create an atmosphere and a plate of food that indicates you want me to be there (or even that your staff does)."}
{"text":"Much better. A few months ago I wrote a review about this place and was not very complimentary, but they have greatly improved.  I don't know if they got a new cook or what, but the food and the service are leaps and bounds better than when I wrote my previous review.  Give them a chance!"}
{"text":"Classic mexican place, Not too different from the others but i did notice their bar seating was a little weird. the chairs were either too tall for the bar or the bar was too tall for the chairs. 

We sat at a normal table that seated four. The table top was made of complete beer bottle caps which i thought was very unique. I've never seen that in a  restaurant or bar before so i thought it was pretty interesting. The food here was decent, tasted like similar places I've been too but nothing unfamiliar. I did enjoy their burritos more than usual, i thought they were bigger than most places.

I always love the sides in mexican dishes. My favorite is the rice and refried beans. i wish they would have given us larger tortillas when my hubby order the fajita platter but i guess smaller portions help you control more of what you eat. The one good thing about this place was the Margaritas. They make a delicious classic margarita but I wasn't too thrilled about the price. they offer about 3 to 4 different sizes and almost 5 varieties of flavors. I go lemon lime because i was never too thrilled with strawberry or watermelon.

This little place is along the strip in squirrel hill on Murray Ave. If you go up the hill it's on your right and if your going down, it's on the left. If you stop by here try the margarita it's absolutely great!!"}
{"text":"So I this will be my first time ever giving a restaurant such a low rating. I thought that I would never experience such a low grade visit, but I did.

I was in Pittsburgh with a buddy of mine for a concert and we decided to stop at a place in downtown Pittsburgh for some food. We decided on Mexican since you can't really go wrong with it.

As soon as we walked into this place, the host was standing there on his phone and didn't even bother to look up until about a minute later. He stared at me and my friend as if he was in distress and asked \"how can I help you\" I politely requested a table for two and we were seated. Our waiter ended up being the rude host & 10 minutes later we were asked if we would like anything to drink. I requested a water with lemon and he brought me a water with a lime in it!

Okay how can you mess something up as simple as that?! And how on earth does it take 10 minutes to bring out a drink?! At this point I was ready to get up and leave. But it had unfortunately begin to pour down raining outside. The Salsa and chips were mediocre, the salsa tastes of pure tomato paste and the amount of chips supplied were bare minimal for two people. 

So eventually he took our orders, my friend ordered the appetizer sampler & I ordered an order of wings with an side order of a chicken quesadilla. It took about 15 minutes for the food to come out and when it finally did come out, I was served my wings but no quesadillas. The waiter mumbled some stuff when he brought out our food and I assumed that he was stating that my quesadillas would be out soon. So I began to eat my wings, they are disgusting. It basically tasted like they poured the nasty tomato paste salsa all over the wings and heated it up. In the middle of the platter was a small dish of hot tomato paste. How do you mess up wings???

Five minutes go by and i'm wondering where my quesadillas are. So I ask the waiter when he brushed pass, and he looks at me and says \"oh they are on your friends plate, and I assumed that you knew that. That is why I put two small plates on the table\" I have never heard such utter bull in my entire life. This wouldn't make any sense either considering the fact that my friend ordered an appetizer platter that included quesadillas. I was more than ready to challenge him on this and I gave him a look. He saw my face & stated \"I'll go check on your quesadillas\". They came out eventually and it was about half a quesadilla on a plate. 

The quesadilla was okay, it had minimal flavor and wasn't anything too spectacular. At this point I wanted the check and to get out of dodge.

This had to be one of the worst restaurant experiences that i've ever had in my life. The people that work at this restaurant need to take a class on restaurant etiquette in addition to customer service. The prices should also be lowered considering the food that is being served is below sub-par& the recipes need to be revamped, considering that there is no Mexican flare and non-existent flavor."}
{"text":"Really overpriced, flavorless Mexican food. It was still edible... and there was a lot of food... but blegh. The pico de gallo was the only thing I actually remembered liking. The meat was really rubbery and overseasoned, and the beans and such seemed like they came out of a can. Maybe it's because I've been spoiled by the uber cheap, hole-in-the-wall mexican places elsewhere in the U.S... where the servers barely speak English. 

Our server was super nice though.. :T 

I just know I won't go back, which makes me sad.. I would like to support all of my neighborhood's businesses."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time, and the service is always friendly.  One of my favorite things to get is the enchiladas con mole.  I always get one chicken, one bean, and one cheese.  All are great, and the sauce is delicious!  I have also recently been getting the fajitas, which are different than the standard fajitas that I'm used to.  The filling is mixed with a tasty tomato sauce that's a nice change.  Overall, this is one of my favorite places to go to in Squirrel Hill, and I heartily recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ate there with a friend and we both experienced symptoms of food poisoning the next day."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Cuzamil.  The service is always fast and friendly and their portions (in general) are pretty big.   My only criticism would be the missing meat.  As I said, the portions are big, but if you open up the tortillas, you can see the severe lack of actual meat contained within.  Overall, I think they are really trying and they have improved each of the three time I've gone over the past year or so.  I'd say if you're skeptical, wait for the inevitable Groupon (they do them a lot) and use that to at least give them a chance."}
{"text":"For Pittsburgh I am giving this four stars, there isn't much for mexican food here and that ain't lyin.

I got the stuffed Pico de Gallo and it was yummy, also tasted the Chimichunga platter mmmm no problems with flavoring. Way more authentic than Mad Mex, For example I cannot even find Pico De Gallo on most menus at \"mexican restaurants\" here let alone a whole pepper stuffed.

The portions are huge but they suffice, the service was good a little slow on gettin gour checks. Margaritas were not great stick with beer. I am not sure why all the bad Yelp reviews? I mean there are actual brown people working here, its a mexican restaurant and yes Pittsburgh sometimes brown people have accents."}
{"text":"Really poor service, almost amazingly bad. 
We had to be stopped from walking out. Tables were unclean. Not a single drink refill between us. The food has better than taco bell, I guess. However a word of caution, ordering a \"5 out of 10\" on the hot/spicy scale, means your lips will melt off of your face from the inedible nuclear mess on your plate. 
Neither one of us could eat it. Even the tequila sunrise was poor."}
{"text":"If you can overlook the horrendous service and lack of ambiance, the food is quite decent. Not somewhere to write home about, but still some pretty good food."}
{"text":"Good food. As close to authentic as you will get in this city. Decently priced. 

It's been a grueling time trying to find a place with decent Mexican food. In California this would be considered \"eh\" but in Pittsburgh it will suffice to fix my Mexican food craving (sorry Pittsburgh but mad Mex shouldn't even be allowed to put itself in the Mexican category). 

This place is a lot warmer and friendlier on the inside. I walked by this place all the time but never bothered going in until yesterday. 

I do not recommend ordering the guacamole (it doesn't even look like it's made out of avocados). The chips are store bought. The fruit put into the sangria tastes like one of those little fruit cups. 

I had the carnitas plate (rice and beans and meat were all delish). My girlfriend had the vegetarian burritos and said they were both delicious. If you're vegan or vegetarian I would def recommend this place since the menu explicitly states all their rice, beans, and tortillas are vegetarian. 

I'll def be going back when I get a little home sick for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is probably the most authentic, family owned and operated Mexican restaurant in town. And by family operated, if you are bothered by abuela helping out with service, even though ella sólo sabe algunas palabras en inglés, perhaps you would be more comfortable elsewhere. 

I have been to Cuzamil several times and have never been disappointed. 

I recently brought a friend to eat there with me and he agreed that while a glitzy, better capitalized chain restaurant might provide better decor, lighting and canned music, in terms of what is actually served at your table, it was much better than the typical Mexican themed chain restaurant he was accustom to frequenting. The food was top notch and the margaritas were perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for lunch today (only open for lunch on Saturdays). The server was friendly and checked on us regularly. I found the prices to be on the high side for the quality of the food (entrees 10-18, no lunch menu). We got the Nachos Cuzamil (with chicken) and the Poblano Chile Rellenos (with pork).

The Nachos were disappointing: the chicken was somewhat dry, they forgot the guacamole, and the chips were overdone in spots. When we asked for the guacamole, they brought a small bowl. I found the guac to be passably tasty, but weird. It was thin and had an odd color (not bright green, as I would expect). Maybe heavy on the onion and with some tomatillo in there? Hard to tell.

The chile rellenos, however, were outstanding. The pork was succulent, the chiles were tasty, the sauce was tangy and delicious, and the accompanying rice and beans were good. The portion was big enough that we probably could have just split that entree and foregone the nachos.

All in all, the place seemed good, but a bit uneven. The discrepancy between the nachos and the rellenos was striking, but we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Distinctly average to subpar Mexican food. I've only eaten here once and have not felt interested in returning. I'll give them an extra star because the service was friendly but there's certainly much better Mexican food to be found in Pittsburgh."}
