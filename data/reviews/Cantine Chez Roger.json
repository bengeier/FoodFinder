{"text":"We dropped in here on our way to visit our CSA farm.  We wanted to stop somewhere for lunch, but didn't want to stop at one of the many fast food chains dotting highway 10.  We knew that somewhere between the 10 and the farm we were bound to encounter a non chain fast food stop, and Chez Roger was the first place we found.  

The restaurant itself is quite modest.  You go in, figure out what you want, wait in line and order and pay, and then wait around for your order to be called.  The ordering/waiting area is a bit cramped, with the front door right next to the cash, but it seems to work ok as long as there isn't a huge rush of people (as there was when we first arrived).  We had to wait quite awhile, probably because it was busy.

The wait and cramped waiting quarters were worth it, because the galvaude poutine I had was one of the best I've ever had.  Galvaude, if you've never had it before, means with chicken and peas.  Sort of like if a poutine and hot chicken sandwich had a baby.  There's was spot on.  The fries were awesome, the right size, a little crispy but greasy in the middle, the gravy fit the \"poutine gravy\" taste profile, the chicken and peas just right.  The cheese was a bit peculiar: it was all hiding on the bottom of the dish.  Once I discovered it though, and mixed it in, good stuff.  The kind that squeaks when you eat it, even after hanging out in the hot gravy for a bit.  Definitely fresh stuff.  My dining companion had a cheeseburger and a pogo, that he said were just fine, though not the best he's ever had.  Next time I have a feeling he'll go for the pogo poutine (yup, there's a pogo poutine!).

On the way out we discovered that Chez Roger is also an ice cream parlour.  The soft ice cream cone that a small child was eating looked sooooo gooood.  But we knew that that wasn't a good idea, not after having consumed our lunch.  If ever I find myself in the area in need of a leg stretch and with a hankering for soft ice cream, I know where I'm stopping."}
{"text":"As nice a little family place as one could ask for in a small town.  The place is clean, the service was prompt and friendly, and they even made a fair effort to accommodate my poor French. The poutine was just right.  The fries were crisp on the outside and moist in the center, the gravy just salty enough and the curds began to melt into the bacon and onion just as it was served.  Seeing green peas and gravy poured over a burger was a shock, but if you want a nice taste of small town Quebec, then here you go."}
{"text":"Il n'est pas mal du tout ce petit resto de village. À vrai dire, il s'agit ni plus ni moins que d'une institution pour les habitants de Farnham, car l'endroit est ouvert depuis plus de 70 ans. Oui, oui 70 ans! Ça fait beaucoup de hot-dog, d'hamburger et de frites tout ça. Pour ma part, je me suis laissé tenter par une poutine saucisse ainsi qu'un sandwich \" Le Martin Die \" (Pain hot-dog, viande hachée, oignons sautés, fromage orange et sauce au poivre). Si la poutine m'a laissé sur une impression mitigée (la sauce avait un léger arrière-gout de brûlé) le Martin Die lui était succulent et totalement différent. Semblerait-il qu'il s'agit d'une création unique à ce petit resto. Tant mieux, non? Car c'est toujours ce qu'on recherche lorsqu'on pose les pieds dans l'un de ses bouibouis de village. J'ajouterais aussi que, lors de ma visite, le resto était d'une propreté très  correcte. 

Chez Roger est donc un endroit sympathique et chaleureux avec une nourriture qui réconforte l'estomac. En bref, du gros bonheur à petit prix. Je recommande."}
