{"text":"I love this restaurant been coming here for years the costumer service is outstanding. Great food, great people to hang around with, this restaurant is just excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my family love to visit this restaurant!!!! Home cooked food at very low prices. We love the portion size as well. Very polite and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my wife and mother.  Everything we had was very good, and the prices were very good as well.  Our waitress, Stephanie, was so polite and accommodating.  I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was priced low but left my wife and i with an unsettled stomach. Place seems always packed so maybe just a bad batch of hash browns. May try a takeout meal to give them another try."}
{"text":"This is the best diner in Euclid. You can get a variety of huge breakfasts here for under $6. We've been here a number of times and never been disappointed. The Crazy 8 breakfast in particular is good, and so is the one with smoked sausage. The real clincher here though is the scrambled eggs. So many places you go, it feels like you're eating a packing peanut when you get scrambled eggs. Not here. They still have a creamy, moist texture to them. (I am so snooty about restaurant scrambled eggs that a good comment on them should make you take note.) The place is always clean and the servers are friendly too. Forget the other diners around, THIS is where you should go! What it lacks in d√©cor it makes up for in any other imaginable category."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly. Makes you feel like you're coming home. They use a real hollandaise and make the fluffier pancakes I've ever had"}
{"text":"My first visit to Cortina's, even though I've driven past numerous times.  My husband and I were running errands on a Sunday morning and he suggested that we stop, based on his previous visits.  The restaurant was fairly full, with a steady stream of people coming in, as we sat down.  The prices are RIDICULOUSLY cheap....OMG.  My husband and I had the 3 egg weekend special, which came with your choice of ham, bacon, or sausage, toast and hashbrowns for $4.99.  Everything was hot and freshly prepared, portions were more than sufficient.  Our entire bill, which included an orange juice for my husband, was just a little over $11....WOW.  Our server was attentive and eager to please.   I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite breakfast spot on the east side. Cheap, convenient and consistent good breakfast every time. Portions on the bacon are a little small (2 pieces) but other than that a big breakfast that keeps you full til dinner time! You should try the blueberry pancakes!"}
{"text":"Sure the plaza is a little run down. Ok a lot. But that doesn't prevent me from returning here time after time. Cortina's has always been just good enough. Nothing fancy at all. But the police frequent this place, so it has to be pretty darn good. And it is. The service is always top notch and the food made fresh as ordered. Does it have the latest and greatest trends? No of course not. But it does have all the classic diner food one comes to expect of a place like this. Plus breakfast all day. The majority of the menu items are under $10 ($6.99 seems to be popular)."}
