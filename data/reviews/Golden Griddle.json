{"text":"Roach on the table absolutely disgusting! Would never recommend not clean at allllll !!!!"}
{"text":"I find is shocking that people rate this better than 2 stars. 
Golden griddle is on par with the Mandarin for ruining food that should be perfectly simple to make well. 

Whether it's off of the buffet or the menu (and I have seen a waitress add buffet bacon to an a la cart plate), might be fresh but tastes like frozen breakfast junk. Always feel ill after eating it. And the waiters and waitresses generally hate their lives and don't mind inflicting it on patrons.

Skip golden griddle. Go to any hole in the wall breakfast joint, or a pub with a brunch menu to get a decent meal at the same price."}
{"text":"Awful service, had to wait 20 minutes to order and another 30 to get our food. We ordered pancakes, and when they finally got there we noticed they were the same ones they were offering at the buffet (mini pancakes). Taste was ok but didn't make up for the negatives. Expensive and lousy, would not go back and don't recommend it at all."}
{"text":"My partner and I went there today ,had the buffet, wile eating  we watch a couple waitress grabbing ice with their hands , then filling the drinking glass with water, mmmm we were not to impressed , spoke to the manager , not too much of a big deal, NOT going there ever"}
{"text":"A few nights ago I $20 for extremely crappy food that I regret spending money on.  It was late and me plus a friend wanted some grub to eat on, there was a few choices.  We could've gone to the sushi place next to it (WHICH WE SHOULD'VE!) instead we saw \"Free Wi-Fi\" that drawn us in. 

Okay first thing we notice is a dirty restaurant.. seriously tables were sticky and the whole store was dark regardless of their lighting.  The washroom is extremely gross only go if you really have to, so nasty, smelly and not clean at all. 

I first ordered a \"Belgian waffle with strawberry fruit topping with icecream\" 8.99 well first of all NEVER came with icecream... the fruit topping was a white dark opaque color that I would say was spoiled.. so I called over a waiter and he said I could get something else off the menu for the same price.  

I got a western sandwich that comes with fries and a salad (8.99) never got the salad either.. it was okay.  Much better than that disgusting waffle with putrid topping.. fries are clearly frozen and not fresh but whatever.  My friend got two breakfast wraps which has bacon, eggs and cheese with fries (6.99) it was pretty good IMO. 

Overall my experience was terrible, atmosphere just horrible, food even worse.. I felt so sick and really wanted my money back but I didn't bother bringing that to their attention.  

Seriously even if you need food at a late time don't go here, it's just horrible.  Go to a McDonald's or a Starbucks (the downtown ones are usually 24hrs) it beats in flavour, freshness, service and value!

Gold Griddle you will NOT be seeing me come back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is that this place is your typical late-night Denny's or IHOP. I was just glad that there was a restaurant nearby that was open after 2AM after a night of drinking. 

I got the Pancake country style breakfast. The food was okay but maybe I just ate all of my huge breakfast plate because I was drunk and hungry. You can't really mess up breakfast food!"}
{"text":"I went to this location last weekend for the buffet, and got an omelette at the omelette bar first it was watery inside and then I found a hair baked right into it. Then my daughter got some pancakes and there was a hair baked right into that also. Told the waitress I want to speak to the manager this brown idiot comes over and has the BALLS to tell me it wasn't a hair. He tells me don't worry I'll take care of the bill so he gives me 50% off I am soooooo disgusted with this reastaurant, my meal should have been free of charge. And NO I didn't put the hair in there myself it was baked right into both those items. I will NEVER go again. I give this location no star but unfortunately I have to"}
{"text":"I have been here with my boyfriend about 6 times in the past two weeks. The breakfast food is beyond amazing!! Great eggs, pancakes, and crepes. I do strongly advice you do not order anything not breakfast. I ordered the side Peirogies. How can someone mess up Peirogies so bad is beyond me!!! It was so rock hard, I feel like I ate two boxes of captain crunch the roof of my mouth is so sore it's just destroyed!! So never getting anything but breakfast from there from now on!!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, the Golden Griddle is a crappy restaurant filled with all night losers. The only reason you go here is cause you been up all night and you need a Griddle signature sloppy breakfast. American's have Denny's, and we have this joint. When Maple Leaf Gardens was still open to the public, this was where I went after games. But to really understand the true function of the Griddle, you have to go between 4-5am."}
{"text":"I have had many family breakfasts here over the decades....used to love eating here.
Now the prices are outrageous and you don't even get REAL maple syrup anymore. For the money we spend (our last bill for two adults and one child came to $65), the syrup should be authentic.  The sausages are always undercooked and when I ask for them to be WELL DONE...they still come to me not well done. I sent the sausage back and requested for them to be burnt....still not to my satisfaction. My husband and parents have decided we are done with Golden Griddle. Now we go to The Coach House for brunch and our bill is HALF of what we were paying at the griddle (same amount of food, cooked to perfection the first time and only $35).
The Coach House does not serve real maple syrup either....but with the money we are saving we don't mind bringing our own"}
{"text":"It's a traditional Canadian restaurant. I like to try Canadian food especially there are so much outside food in Canada, which get me confused what real Canadian food is. To answer this question, my Canadian friend brought me here, and we tried the pancake, omelette and fish and chips. It was good! They also serve different kinds of tea, coffee - free refill. And the price is okay too, not pricy at all. 

I will recommend Golden Griddle to my friends. It's a family oriented restaurant."}
{"text":"Good old Golden Griddle, you will never go wrong with their butter milk pancakes.  Cheap and does the trick.  Did the all you can eat breakfast once just because I could.  You can't ask for anymore than a guy standing there ready to make you whatever omelet you want.  No bells and whistles to this place.  Just great pancakes."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food has improved significantly this summer. New management took over supposedly.Had the all you can eat buffet which was great especially since omelettes were covered as well. Definitely worth coming again."}
{"text":"Golden Griddle is one of those places that you recommend to someone where a disclaimer is required. Here are some appropriate ones:

- \"I know it looks like it was built in 1970. I think it actually was. It's not dirty though.\"
- \"The food won't blow you away, but it's far from below average and it's always consistent.\"
- \"The service is slow when it's busy, but they're really friendly.\"

These are all very accurate descriptions of the pros and cons of this place, and I think they even each other out. I've had a visit where it took literally 18 minutes before they took our order (I used a stopwatch. I like counting). I have also been unimpressed by their pancakes, or their garnishes on burgers, or how expensive their orange juice is. But, since I was introduced to this place with a disclaimer, I've always let these things slide. You have to know what you're getting into, and you won't be as disappointed. The tables and washrooms are clean for a place that's always open. Their burgers and sandwiches are actually decent. And when they're not busy, you'll find the waiters are actually quite friendly. 

If you live in Yonge and Eglinton, your choices for late-night-eats-that-are-not-McDonald's are pretty limited. Mars is good but it's small, and hotter than the planet Mars itself in the summer. Golden Griddle is the next best compromise for a greasy spoon/24-hour dive that's within a five-minute walk from the subway. 

Sometimes perfectly average is perfect."}
{"text":"Had lunch here this afternoon. Hubby loved the steak and kids loved the canadian bacon/eggs benedict. Would definitely come back and visit other GG for the breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I needed carbs and protein after our workout at the Mattamy Athletic Centre. We looked across the street...we saw breakfast food so we thought, \"why not?\"

We are very pleased with our choice! The host and servers are very friendly. Our server was very attentive (even though it wasn't busy) but we got service fast.

I ordered 2 eggs, sausage and buttermilk pancakes. My boyfriend was brave and did the unlimited Pancake Tuesday special with a side of home fries. The pancakes left a sticky feeling in your throat. My boyfriend could only handle 5 pancakes. Anymore he would've needed a pitcher of water to down.

Overall we loved our experience. We would definitely go back for sure (instead of going to Cora's which is more expensive)."}
{"text":"I've been to the one on eglinton east twice this month already and enjoyed myself. Had both the omelette with french toast [very yum] and today had the grilled burger. Impressed with the size of the portions and the efficient service. 

Our server was very sweet and ensured that I had everything I needed. The place looked very clean, I'm just wondering after reading all the reviews if maybe the place now has new management, i certainly found the place neat as a pin....the food good value for your money!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst breakfast I've ever paid for. While it was a breakfast buffet, and you can't expect the food to be very fresh, my pancake was like a hockey puck (it hurt my teeth when I bit into it) and the bacon wasn't thoroughly cooked. 

I can see this being an awesome hangover remedy, but for over $14 (plus drinks), I expected a tiny bit more. The waitress I had was amazing but the food was just deep-fried, greasy garbage. Wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Kinda went in with my BF for some nostalgic late breakfast... but it was more like overpriced, cheaply made, lower-than-diner foods... they tasted ok because you know when you are hungry everything taste equally good lol but when i think back i kinda went like \"blahhhhhh\" especially for the apple crepe: it was filled with apple jam and super sugary canned apple ooze, more like those fillings for apple pie ..."}
{"text":"Putrid food...I don't have much else to say.  All the food is greasy and salty.  The worst I remember being the bacon which had a very distinct taste of mildew.  

I will never go back there again.  That was a big mistake to go here rather than waiting for a table at Cora's."}
{"text":"Despite promoting wifi, this restaurant will not let you sit and work at your table with a laptop! The manager at this location threatened to physically remove me for working here, despite the fact that I bought a meal, and half the tables were empty. I spent 75 minutes here and was polite, quiet, and yet was still treated rudely. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices, friendly staff, and PERFECT hours!"}
{"text":"A 24/7 golden griddle? A dream come true!
I usually go to the Hamilton golden griddle, which I have to say is a bit nicer. But the food is the same, and I was happy to be able eat my waffle at 4 am :-)
Odd thing that they have the same food but the actual menu itself looks very different!
Staff was not very friendly and I got the bill before I was done. I think this guy just wanted a night shift job where he didn't need to serve people."}
{"text":"This place is just plain gross. The eggs smelled like dirty dogs. The prices were high for the quality of food. The service was the only good thing. The pancakes were not fluffy and I barely ate any of my food. It is worse than an IHOP or Waffle House. I wish I would have never stepped a toe nail in this place."}
{"text":"A basic brunch place, nothing spectacular. What else can you expect from a 24/7 diner? We had pleasant experience there though. Don't order eggs benny there, the sauce was too thick and plain. My fiends had combos and were satisfied with quality/size/taste ratio."}
{"text":"If not for the food, this is a great place to go for 24 hour service and free wifi for finishing up some last minute work. The waitstaff don't bother you and I didn't feel any obligation to buy food, it's great for students! Came on a Tuesday night and it seems like they have a place reserved for worker bees, noticed other patrons who were working only had a glass of (free) water or nothing at all on their tables. 

*If you're a Ryerson student, RUSecure is fully accessible at this location."}
{"text":"Everything comes quickly and seems ok. At first. 

The coffee cups are square which makes drinking fun. 

But upon further eating, my friend's special $3.99 all-you-can-eat 10-grain pancakes taste \"metallic\". I'm disappointed but not surprised that processed cheese is used for my omelette. The toast is almost completely soaked through with butter. The hash browns taste chalky. 

SPOTTED: a cube of ham in my, \"vegetarian\" omelette. 

I'm too shy to bring it up to waitress. However, she notices that my friend is not eating her pancakes anymore. In a flash, she brings her own favourite, the buttermilk pancakes with free chocolate chips. 

I appreiciate the service, but that was a pretty sorry meal."}
{"text":"I just had a breakfast here.  

The service was OK.  Food was OK (nothing to write home about, but acceptable).  They even served me hot tea with a glass of ice so  I could have an unsweetened iced tea.

But I don't know how the others who commented on using the wifi were able to do so, unless it was for a short time. 

I had the waitress come over with the bill while I was still there,  I thought she was going off shift, but no.  Well,  I went and paid, and found out there was a limit on time.  As I was about to have a meeting online, I asked if I could stay long enough for that.

As a side note, the restaurant was nearly empty (it was the whole time I was there), it was not like I was taking a table they could use for other customers, as they had almost none.  That does not come as  a surprise to me.

The waitress said that would be OK, but then the manager came by, and it got really ugly.  He hover over me, and said I had to go, that they had a policy that people can only be there for 1.5 hours for a meal.  And as I packed to go, he stood there, very aggressively hulking (he was a large person, pretty intimidating).   I got the feeling he was about ready to swing on me, the way he was acting, incredibly rude, beyond rude, even.  He was saying he'd pack up my computer as I was not moving as fast as he'd like (I don't move very well, I have somewhat limited mobility).   He also complained that I shouldn't have plugged into the power outlet -- I offered to pay the few cents that power might have cost but that didn't satisfy him.  

If I have ever seen such a rude service person, I can't remember.   If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  

Avoid this place.  That man should not be a manager, no one should act that way, much less to a customer.  The man must have some serious issues, is the best I can say. I was almost ready for lunch in fact, and would have bought lunch there,  had he not come over and started acting that way.  He lost the rest of my business for my stay in Toronto, including the meal I was about to buy.

I would write to Golden Griddle corporate, but judging from the past reviews here on Yelp, that probably won't do much."}
{"text":"Golden Griddle is a chain for descent breakfast meals, unfortunately this location missed the memo. The location had a cozy family restaurant feel but that was the only thing going for it.

Our omelettes were an epic fail, the spinach was not fresh, it was frozen.  It was not very tasty either.  The buckwheat pancakes tasted like cardboard.  I ordered buttermilk pancakes which were the highlight of my meal.  

Service was awful though, it took 30 minutes for us to get our meals.  We had to ask butter with our pancakes and refills in our coffee.  I was expecting more attentive service considering the restaurant was half empty.

I would avoid this Golden Griddle location and have breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just visited Golden Griddle nearly a couple of hours ago, around midnight. One thing I like about this place is that it's 24 hours, which is convenient. Being there at midnight on a Wednesday night, it wasn't too crowded; in fact, other than my friend and myself, there were only a couple of other people. The service is really fast (probably because it wasn't crowded), and it's great. The waitress was happy and pleasant.

I have to say though, this place is really expensive. It's an average place, somewhere you go for a late-night snack, but the prices are really up there. A Belgian waffle w/ a scoop of ice cream is $9 without tax/tip. Some fish & chips for $10. It's average food at above average prices, which is why I probably won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't even deserve 1 star. The service & food were below standard. I don't recommend this place to anyone, not even my dog. It's sad to have a place like this still open with so many horrible reviews, what a joke!"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place, so we started going with friends as a late night option because they're open 24h. They're sort of off the regular Yonge-Eg scene, so it's always pretty empty and quiet, no matter what hour of the day, which I always appreciate because you can have a good conversation in relative privacy with your eating partner.

Turns out it's one of the best diner's I've ever eaten at, specifically for their eggs benedict. Every time I get eggs benny at another restaurant, the eggs are really opaque white with these odd stringy edges. Looks like melted plastic, honestly. And the sauce is always a strong yellow with a slightly bitter taste, has a watery base, kind of has micro-lumps in it. Looks like when you mix instant gravy too fast, it just doesn't turn out velvety and smooth.

Now enter Golden Griddle. They're eggs are poached to perfection and have a healthy natural white translucency to them. And the sauce is a creamy, thick pale yellow with a really nice lemony taste. Seriously, no other restaurant I've ever attempted does eggs benny this good.

Everything else here is really nice too. The home fries are nice, crispy seasoned potato cubes, their crepes and other sweet breakfast items are great, with delish fruit additions. Never gotten a bad thing from here, it's just really decent good food. I've gone a dozen times since living here, and I'll be sad when I move and don't have this to go to at 1 am after a big studying session with friends."}
{"text":"the food is horrible. how do you mess up breakfast food!?

if i were to bump the table the waffles would have disintegrated - they were so overcooked it wasn't even funny. waffles are not supposed to be super crunchy!"}
{"text":"GG is a Toronto institution.  This location was the first in Toronto, and opened over 40 years ago!

That said, don't rush over to try it out.  Come to think of it, we didn't.  It's about number 65 on our weekly breakfast tour.

They've got everything you need for breakfast - eggs, omelettes (it was Omelette Monday!), pancakes, hotcakes (which weren't selling very well), griddle cakes, flapjacks, waffles, crepes and various fried meats - it's just all pretty average to below average fare.  The \"home fries\" were those frozen tater tot thingies.  'Nuff said?  Not quite.  The coffee was horrible at $2.09, especially compared to last week's amazing $1.97 version at the Canadian Pie Company, and the toast was lame.

I can't imagine any reason to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every time I have come here has been great. I love their Caesar Salad. I don't think I have ever tried a better salad than here. 

The place is casual, and spacious and is great to bring friends. They do open 24/7 so it's great after going to a party ."}
{"text":"Last meal in Toronto before taking the subway to Union Station.  Food was ok, but service was exceptional.  Sat outside on the patio and people watched while we ate (only ones on the patio due to the weather).  Our waitress was so kind and efficient.  I would have rated it better had it not been for the food not being so great (messy, low quality ingredients, pricey)."}
{"text":"I came to Golden Griddle on a Sunday morning and had just about the worst experience I've ever had in any sort of restaurant. Ever.

When my friend and I arrived, we were seated at a small table near the front of the restaurant. There was barely any room between tables; probably about less than a foot between them. I could hear everything my neighbours were saying and I felt pretty uncomfortable. The waitress that would be serving us for the rest of our experience arrived not too long after and took our drink orders. I ordered plain water and my friend ordered ice tea. This is about the only thing the waitress didn't mess up.

After letting us have a few minutes to decide what to eat, the waitress came back to take our orders. I ordered the belgian waffle with bananas, whipped cream and a side of sausages; he ordered the cinnamon pecan belgian waffle.

We then proceeded to wait 40 minutes for our meal to arrive. 

Now, don't get me wrong; I understand that breakfast/brunch places are the busiest on Sundays but in my experience, they've never been quite this bad. Our waitress didn't even come to apologize for the wait or to let us know that things were taking longer than usual. When our order finally showed up, my whipped cream was missing. In its place was a side of chocolate spread. The waitress came back a moment later with a refill for my friend's iced tea and I said, \"Excuse me, but I ordered whipped cream.\" To which she replied, \"Oh, I thought you would have liked some chocolate to go with your bananas.\"

...No kidding, no joke. Despite me having specifically ordered whipped cream, she decided that I would like chocolate more. I'm completely baffled at why anyone would make this assumption. Even nearly 12 hours later, I'm STILL at a loss.

Our sausages never came. I had figured that they were on the way but the waitress never returned so we weren't able to ask about it. Fortunately, we weren't charged for it. When the bill arrived, I paid for it with credit. A brief moment later, the waitress returned and asked if I \"had another one\" because \"the machine wouldn't read it.\" I incredulously told her no, and she went back to try it again. Sure enough, it worked fine. It gives me the impression that she lazily swiped it once and didn't bother trying again.

So, between the lousy food, terrible atmosphere (the place looks like a complete dive inside and out), and miserable service, I can safely say that neither of us will be returning here. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place is very bad from the service to the food.  Most places you go into for breakfast they will service you coffee take your order then when food arrives they will check on you while you have your breakfast if you want more coffee not this place you get you food your coffe and you won't see your server till they bring you the check ."}
{"text":"This was the worst place I ever went for breakfast.  I got there with a friend of mine it took for ever for our food to arrive the waiter poured us coffee and that  was the last we saw of the waiter until she gave us the bill . She never came back around to see how things are or to see if we needed more coffee."}
{"text":"This is the most awful buffet that I have ever seen in my life. Scrambled eggs cooked until they are breaking apart. Bacon cooked until it looks like bacon bits. Sausages that have been cooked until hard. Fresh fruit that is brown and disgusting. It is clear they need a real kitchen staff fur to make simple breakfast foods. All for the low price of $15.99. What great value. A must!"}
{"text":"This place is old style, not in a good way. Food wasn't that good, some that you can make yourself I guess. Maybe people like it because it's home style meal?

Good thing is that you will always get a seat here, was pretty empty when we went but maybe because it's the weekends?"}
{"text":"Always see this place when we're walking around. Went here for the brunch buffet - 15.99 for all you can eat of most of their breakfast menu. Egg benedict, waffles, pancakes, scrambled eggs, pie, and much more - all of which tasted average, at best.

The service was average - our server sat us at a big 6 person table for just the two of us, and forgot to bring cream with the coffee. The atmosphere reminded me of a diner back in New Brunswick - dated look, very generic, nothing special. 

I can't complain, but likely won't be back. I can see how some people love it, the place is so average that it's really based on the memories made, especially with it being opened 24 hours."}
{"text":"Went here recently on a trip to Toronto and had a pretty good experience. The service was excellent. The first morning we went, I ordered the Belgian Waffle with Apple and Vanilla Ice Cream and loved it. I didn't even need to put syrup on it, when I'm usually one of those people who likes to drown their pancakes and waffles in syrup. The square coffee cups were neat.

The second morning I wasn't quite as impressed, I got the Swiss, Broccoli and Chicken omelette which didn't have nearly enough fillings. My fiancé ordered the western omelette but wanted cheese instead of the green peppers. They added green peppers anyway along with the cheese, but didn't charge for the cheese. 

Overall, it was a decent breakfast and I'd eat there again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"When I lived in Toronto, this was my all time favorite breakfast spot.  Whether it was was midday, dinnertime, or 4am after my bartending shift, this place never disappointed.  It is open 24/7 every day of the year... even Christmas!  How can you beat that convenience?

My meal of choice at Golden Griddle is their breakfast.  This is one of those places where you can eat breakfast for dinner because it's that good.  The cooks are pretty good with following special instructions and my egg white omelet always came out perfectly.  The coffee is bottomless and the tater tots... oh man... faaaaaaantastic!  They have their own special seasoning that they use and if you love it as much as I do, you can buy it from them.

There is a small strip of outdoor seating on a makeshift deck that comes in handy during the cool summer days.

I wouldn't recommend GG for a steak dinner (even though it's on the menu) but this is a great diner style place for quick eats."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place when my friend kept ranting and raving about how amazing their breakfast buffet is. But I was not too pleased.

The location was nice. And thats about all this place had going for it.

Before I start: note that I had the buffet and everything I say from here on out is about that experience.

The service was absolute garbage. We seen our waitress twice: once to seat us, and once to take our money. I hate this custom of tipping we have here in North America! It's stupid! If you don't earn your tip, you don't get a tip. The way I do it is I start with whatever I expect 25% of my bill to be (thats generous) and then every time something happens where the service appeared to be lacking I take off 25 cents. Following that rule this meal would have earned the waitress a whopping $3.50 but I found myself asking \"where the hell is our waitress\" so often that there was no tip left to leave. She should have been paying me for bearing such terrible service! But when I think about this now I wonder if, due to the fact that we were having the buffet if they sort of leave you to yourself. Either way I needed a refill of water really bad.

What was supposed to be a hangover breakfast after a night of 151 and coke, and tequila shots, we needed A LOT of water and good hangover food (which breakfast food usually is).

This food was dry and tasteless for the most part. The best thing on the buffet were the \"potato puffs\" which were obviously dumped in a pan from a McCain Tater Tot's bag.

I think the best part of my experience here was listening to the little girl argue with the balloon guy about what color the flower she wanted should be. (But I'm sure he won't be there every time someone visits this place).

Overall, Golden Griddle might have a good name but this location didn't fulfill that at all. I advise you seek out another one and then leave a review here until we have found the best location in Toronto ;)"}
{"text":"The place is kinda small but the service is good and the food is great. It is the first time in Canada that I had an American-style breakfast and I definitely liked it."}
{"text":"This location is very dated & relies on their weekend business from their breakfast buffet, otherwise they don't get much business (I think).  My wife wanted some blueberry pancakes which were bland and the blueberry sauce they gave was tasteless.  I went there to enjoy some buttermilk pancakes and all else the buffet had to offer.  The pancakes were okay, the bacon was good (you can't really go wrong with bacon), The potato puffs were tasty (McCain frozen product) the scrambled eggs were tasteless, and everything else was bad.  It didn't help that a local politician was having some kind of fundraiser and they took up many seats near the buffet, so when you went up to get something people were standing in the way talking politics, ON A SUNDAY MORNING NO LESS.  I used to go to a different location which was much better on Woodbine & Steeles in Markham, but it was closed due to the lease not being renewed."}
{"text":"The $15 brunch buffet was available when I came. Very much a greasy spoon and don't come in expecting too much. But apart from the way overcooked bacon, the items in the buffet still hit the spot and were reasonable quality. Items included: waffles, pancakes, sausages, (overdone) bacon, scrambled eggs, eggs benny, tater tots, home fries, various cereals, and baked goods - not made in house such as pies, two-bite brownies, along with a bit of fruit and jello. 

See: when I list them all, it doesn't sound so bad does it? Go in with the appropriate expectations and it hits the spot - and calorie count. Good service too."}
{"text":"This place isn't as bad as the previous reviewers say it is. We came here for the weekend breakfast buffet and was surprised at the selection they had for the price. You can't come here expecting champagne on a beer budget. I didn't have high expectations, but the food was actually good, Not great but also not bad as said by the other reviewers. The only negative thing I can say was our waitress was so quick to slam the bill on our table. She gave it to us only 10 minutes after being seated without anybody asking for it. Other than that I will most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had the $4.99 all you can eat buttermilk pancakes for the Tuesday special.  Beautifully light and fluffy, loved the powdered sugar on top. A little butter and syrup on top, and it was a very satisfactory breakfast for dinner type of meal. Good on my wallet too. There's a sufficient seating space for a lot of people. Hooray for student budget places to eat! Also, the wait staff were extremely attentive and nice. Not sure what the negative reviews are all about, because my friends and I sure enjoyed our time here. Give it a try, with your own discernment of reviews, since after all, they are simply opinions - make your own!"}
{"text":"Overlooking the fact that this place is pretty old a little dirty and run down. The breakfast food served here is real good. Great Pancakes, Waffles, Eggs.  The prices are low and they seem to always have a fresh pot of coffee brewing. I really enjoy going to a place and not being able to finish all the food on my plate knowing I don't have to take out a loan to pay for the meal, and this place pulls that off excellently."}
{"text":"This is like the gay denny's of Toronto.  I asked my brother, where's a good breakfast?  I'm starving!!!  He and his girlfriend lives in the center hub of gay village, I thought, okay, gays and brunch, I want bottomless champagne and good tofu scramble.  He brought us here, i was like... this place feels and looks like a chain!  I want my pap and pap or mom and mom's gay breakfast place!  Too hungry so I waived it.  
The service is fast and friendly, one of our waiter seems to be into leather or that biker (motor) gay scene.  Probably won't experience this anywhere else.  Though the food kind of sucks... the potato hash tasted like it was frozen and defrosted it on the grill.  It was all mushy and powdery taste.  The eggs are fine.  The pancakes tasted like store bought packaged mix that you get at hostels.  I don't remember anything else about this place except 90% of the clienteles are gay or lesbian or trans or queer, ...etc.  I like that, but aside from that, the food is whatever."}
{"text":"This is one of the most disgusting places I've ever eaten at and let me tell you... I've seen some sh-t.

First of all the place is filthy and falling apart. it smells,the seats are dirty, the carpet was peeling off the floor and the walls were dirty and splattered with old food from 1998.

we ordered the spinach swiss omelette with three pancakes - the pancakes were inexplicably chewy and tough (frozen). the omelette looked like someone threw up in some eggs and had no distinguishable listed ingredients.

The french toast was something like 8 f-cking dollars for three chewy, MOLDY slices of toast and packaged butter from Chernobyl and some packaged sugar liquid called \"breakfast syrup\" in little containers.

We also got a side of \"perogies\" because why the hell not.
I'm sure you can guess how great they were. again chewy flavorless frozen little nuggets of history microwaved to perfection !

our \"food\" took a very long time to be microwaved and our server came by once to take our orders, again to give us our drinks, once more to give our food and then we had to release a search party to get the bill from her.
 When I brought up the french toast was moldy she asked the assistant manager to comp it but he couldn't as he was not in charge. Yes, thats right. the manager was not in charge and nobody could figure out how to take the french toast off our bill.
Which is a dilly of a pickle if god forbid a server punched in the wrong items for a table... they would have no chance but to pay for hundreds of dollars of mistakes since Golden Griddle is not responsible!

We got the bill, it was not our bill..  so after more waiting we finally got our bill and paid in full for one of the most disgraceful, disgusting meals of all time.

and lastly, I had the unfortunate experience of using the bathrooms.
They were filthy, one stall was out of order and there was no toilet paper despite there being a signature in the slot saying the bathroom had been restocked and cleaned just one god damn hour before we got there.
also the graffiti inexplicably advertising a dildo shop was a nice touch to read while I reached at the empty toilet paper dispenser. 

I'm going to go ahead and assume all these great comments are complete fabrications and were paid for...
 I wasnt expecting some great experience going to this place.,.. but to be called GOLDEN GRIDDLE and not even make fresh pancakes or have real maple syrup at the table or have fresh fu-cking bread for the french toast... ihop has more authentic \"breakfast\" food than this pile of crap. No wonder why Golden Griddles are slowly all closing.."}
{"text":"The service at this place is fast, no matter what you order. If you're craving all-day-breakfast at any hour of the day- this is your spot. The food is just average at best and the decor is drab, but really- the excellent service outweighs anything wrong with this joint. It's usually dead at off-hours too, so it's perfect."}
{"text":"Very Low quality food!!!!!!! Uncleaned cups ( it seems unwashed!), table, dishes,... even not cheap!

If you want to test your self-anger control and practice fake smile ..here is the place. 

BTW, nice waitress."}
{"text":"The absolute worst. The waitress convinced us to get the buffet. Food was cold and disgusting.. for three people the bill came to almost $80 and it was the worst food we have ever had.. We honestly should not have even paid. AVOID."}
{"text":"I remember many years ago, staying in the Days Inn across the street after a good night of partying and then waking up and going to the buffet at Golden Griddle to recoup before heading back out of the city homeward.

I haven't been since the condos to the west were just a parking lot. I remembered good times, mostly because of the nights before, but the Golden Griddle breakfast buffet also held a warm spot amongst those memories.

My, how things have gone downhill. 
Everything was lukewarm or offensively cold (see: french toast), and where I remember to be a guy who would make fresh omelets based on your choice, is now just a heat try with veggie or western omelets that while not terrible, was not the experience I was looking forward to. 
Long story short I ate 3 plates of sausage and bacon (remember to dig from the bottom for the hottest pieces) to make up for the mediocrity of everything else and feel satisfied in my $14.95 expenditure, which is why I'll still give the place 2 stars."}
{"text":"I've visited many Golden Griddles in my day (aka my childhood). I don't remember much about them since I was a child and well, I don't really remember back that far. But I do remember the breakfast buffets and Sunday mornings with the family. Always good memories.

I recently came here with a bunch of friends after a night of debachary. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. This place is great because it's cheaper than Eggspectation and way less greasy than Fran's, the only thing is the place is a *bit* rundown...I mean honestly it's really old inside and is in dire need of a spruce. But realistically, with what you're paying for, it's not a big deal.

I didn't get the buffet as quite frankly it looked a little bit different than what I remember when I was a child. I did have my breakfast staple of eggs, over easy and sausage with home fries and toast. YUM! It was actually really tasty and not greasy and gross like some other places. I usually get the same thing because:
A. I compare and contrast
B. I'm a simple eater
and 
C. I'm just a sucker for runny eggs and home fries

I would definitely come back here again, not in the greatest neighbourhood but come during daylight and you'll be just fine. Oh and try to ignore the gross booths and/or nasty looking tables."}
{"text":"Golden Griddle is a landmark for any child.  If you somehow missed this train when you were young, it's probably too late for you to appreciate the sometimes grungy atmosphere.  By grungy I mean that it never feels like the cleanest, highest quality place, even though nothing looks out of place.  It's just that skin crawly feeling you get.

Anyway, I grew up loving Golden Griddle, so I do enjoy what they offer.  Weekends are breakfast buffets, and during the week this 24-hour diner is a sure fire place to get eggs and coffees whenever you want.  Tuesdays are all-you-can-eat pancakes days, which means Tuesdays are also stuff-your-face-with-pancakes-first-thing-and-spend-the-rest-of-your-day-rolling-around-instead-of-walking days."}
{"text":"Seriously I think I need to throw up and get this low grade slop they served to me out of my stomach. 
I feel bad for writing a bad review, at the same time this restaurant serves crap and I want to warn people and tell them their better off starving and eating breakfast when there are other hunger satisfying options."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place.  We stop in for brunch a couple times a month (usually Sundays, occasionally a Monday).  The servers are quite friendly and attentive as long as the place isn't slammed.  Then they simply do their best, which is all you can ask.

The only thing we've both had there that we agreed wasn't so great was the omelet.  It's flat and relatively bland (I think we had the one with spinach and mushrooms...).  They don't season it in any way and the fillings are at the minimum end; just enough to cover end to end.

That is the only reason I can't give this place 5 stars.  Otherwise, I still stand by my recommendation for this place."}
{"text":"I was walking pass the restaurant and saw the chef having a smoke break out front... And picking his nose. This was the final nail in the coffin. This place already has a reputation for lousy And expensive food. Might as well go to Cora's next door or to the 24/7 Fran's diner across the street."}
{"text":"As a kid and as an adult, I have loved Golden Griddle or as I called it as a child (in an attempt to be cool) the G-Griddle.

Alright, I know this is not the most luxurious restaurant on the map but it does your hunger good if you are a HUGE breakfast food fan or enjoy your lunch/dinner staples as a cheap cost!

This particular location on Eglinton East is open 24 hours, which is great if you need a pre-work early breakfast, after bar drunken snack or a place to eat while you are studying for hours.

I admit that there are some things on the menu that may be a bit dissapointing when it comes to your tastebuds, so I recommend all of the breakfast stuff, and some of the wraps and yummy caesar or greek salads.

Here are some of my GG faves:

- PANCAKES! (I love either plan buttermilk or with any topping. You can get chocolate chips, or fruit topping such as blueberry or strawberry)

- The two eggs with bacon staple (I do not eat pork but GG offers turkey or chicken bacon, which is a yummy substitute)

- Chicken Fingers

- All of the salads (they are actually fresh and have great dressing)


Overall though, if you visit GG, they are the best with the breakfast foods!"}
{"text":"i liked this little joint. I didnt get anything fancy but what i got was just fine. I had homefries, bacon and toast i couldnt complain. I would recommend this place for breakfast, a quick bite to get they also have a buffet on the wkend."}
{"text":"When you first walk into this small family diner you'll probably first notice the dated interior reminiscent of granny's house. While its certainly not the ritz, if you want to grab a no frills, home cooked meal for cheap and enjoy a coffee, here is a perfect place to do so. It has a variety of all-day breakfast items from eggs benni to crepes as well as some other comfort style entrees. They have specials each day but I usually will get one of there omelettes....Monday it's $6.99 for a three egg omelette with your choice of side. Again, if your looking for quality food or anything gourmet you likely won't find that here. What you see is what you get. Bonus point for being open 24hrs a day."}
{"text":"I went here with friends for a celebratory birthday breakfast-for-dinner. 
They didn't have milkshakes even though it was on the menu. I ordered chocolate milk but it was taking a lifetime so I changed my order to beer instead (driven to alcohol). My friends and I were given dirty glasses but just accepted the fact and drank from it anyway. The food was pretty ok, breakfast is easy. I had ham and eggs benedict and my friends had the mega breakfast platter. Everyone enjoyed the food.
The person handling cash turned out to be the cook... I assume he is the manager/owner of the establishment. The waitress kept asking him to change stuff in the back (something to do with the drinks), and to hurry up.
I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for divey establishments. What is great about this place is that they are open 24 hours so it's a good place to eat after a late night of partying."}
{"text":"@Goldengriddlein #YELPTO #TORONTO #WAFFLESORNOTHING

I am totally biased because I used to live around this area and come here for post midnight breakfasts all the time back in the day; also because I've had the BEST 4 AM FIRST DATE here and I will always remember it oh so fondly. 

The attraction was electrifying (and mutual) as we drove together, for a late night / early morning breakfast to Golden Griddle around 3 am. He wanted breakfast, I wanted tea (and in retrospect, I wanted him... so bad). 

We parked across the street for free, just past the Loblaws on Carlton. It was a chilly winter night - he was in a dark blue windbreaker, dressed much warmer than I was. And there I was, with one of the only men I felt connected to instantly, dressed in a grey hoodie and black leggings, basking in my shabby hair and no makeup self. BUT - I could tell that he liked me just as much as I liked him. We started quick but paced our walk to Golden Griddle, his sturdy arm around the small of my back, tension in the air. 

We got seated immediately upon walking in, and the server had no qualms about charging my  phone for me upon my request. My date touched my calves with his foot, beneath the table as the server took our order - he ordered the biggest pancake and eggs breakfast, and I kept to a nice warm green tea. As soon as the server left us to our own devices, he caught my foot in his hand and gently, in a very non creepy way, massaged my ankles, as we flirted with our eyes. He spoke slowly and told me he was glad to have met me and I told him the same. We bantered across the table - our orders were brought to us and the slowness didn't bother us one bit. It gave me more time to look into his grey eyes, reflecting every bit of the heat in mine and to hold on to the moment.

He had been drinking that night, so he ravished the entire HUGE breakfast while I quietly finished sipping on my tea. I was too distracted to offer to pay so he took care of the bill and I graciously thanked him, and then we walked out of Golden Griddle, my hand in his.

As we sat in the car, we were talking about mobile phones and I mentioned that mine was jailbroken. He said his was too - I eyed his Android phone and said \"Rooted, you mean?\" And he said, \"the fact that you know that term is a turn on\" and before I could respond, he pulled me closer and sealed this date with the softest kiss. He kissed me that night again and again, at every red light on the way to his place (I was dropping him home). 

Yes, I saw him again. Multiple times. 

Golden Griddle, making memories since xxxx."}
{"text":"I ordered the hot chicken sandwich, and the baby carrots on the side tasted like they'd been boiled in soapy dishwater. The rest of the food was mediocre, but I didn't come expecting quality food, I picked this place because it's generally not busy, and I wanted to do some reading. 

The large restaurant was empty, save for one other solo diner, but the server rushed me out. While I was still eating, the server brought over the bill and asked \"do you want anything else?\" I asked her if I could see the menu for dessert options. Seeing nothing I was interested in, I let her know I wouldn't be ordering anything else. She dropped the bill in front of me, took my plate (still with food on it), and told me to \"have a good day.\" 

As I finished my burnt coffee, the cook was snoring at a table behind me. 

Yikes."}
{"text":"Visited in Christmas Day and it is open 24 hours. We waited a while to be served, but the food was pretty good considering it was a diner. My sister enjoyed their mild chicken wings and the chicken burger. Would return on a day like Christmas when there aren't many options."}
{"text":"Maybe it should be called the Golden Turd instead.  Awful.  Went here Saturday for a group brunch:

1.  Buffet has little in the way that combines health and tasty.  Most of the offering are fatty and overly sweet.

2.  Except for the omelet station there is little that could be called real cooking - most seems to be stuff made from mixes.  Bread and cake tackily presented in store containers!

3.  Abominable coffee.

4.  Servers kept trying to snatch plates away before we were finished eating.

5.  Ditzizoid  server was more interested in counting the number of people at the table instead of brining things when politely requested.

As my father would describe this in Yiddish:  chozzerai!"}
{"text":"This place is shit tier. My expectations were pretty low going in; the atmosphere sets you up for grungy, greasy, late-night breakfast food. Sometimes quick and dirty bacon and eggs is exactly what you need. Sadly, this restaurant misses even the lowest of low bars by a mile. It's not comforting, or nostalgic -- it's just vile. The water tasted like scum. The crepes with \"strawberries\" were actually just filled with strawberry ooze; like the filling out of a cheap pie. Everything was disgusting. I would rather eat the peach cobbler out of a frozen dinner slathered across a piece of stale bread than taste those crepes again.

The only redeeming factor was that the cashier at the front wasn't paying attention and misread the price on my bill. His incompetence saved me a dollar. Hooray."}
{"text":"Idiots eating waffles.

The shining view of Maple Leaf Gardens is the only thing remotely athletic about this slopbucket.    Everything is battered, buttered and flammable.   

You can smell the triglycerides from across the street.    You can hear the bubbling and crackling of the skillets as you start to sweat Crisco.

This place has been around for over 40 years, and you start to get the feeling that some of the patrons have been sitting in the same place for exactly as long.   You give them cute sardonic nicknames in the back of your mind.   \"Glassy eyed Joe\".  \"Wheelchair Pete\".   \"Morbidly Obese Mona\".     

Eventually I start getting bored reading people's various neck tattoos and I start to wonder.... \"What is it that makes this place always busy?\"    Is there methadone in the syrup?   Is there some kind of secret win-free-dental-care lottery that I'm not privy to?

It's one of the only places in town where people probably wouldn't complain if you put ashtrays back on the table.  Come to think of it, they actually still may be out there.

Pass the syrup, glassy eyed Joe."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for breakfast on a Saturday morning. We always walk by this place and saw a sign saying breakfast buffet. So we decided to give it a try. I have to say, I am not a fan of this place. The seating was okay, kind of like a dinner style. Our server was friendly. However, the restaurant overall is very dated and I have to say, I do question the cleanliness. By the way the washrooms were not good at all. 
The breakfast buffet is $15.99 per person before taxes and tips. The selection was okay. The food quality was okay. Overall, there are definitely better places."}
{"text":"I agree that the negative reviews here are not accurate..at least with my experience.  If you are looking for fine dining or you are from the suburbs and looking for a fancy experience this is not the place for you.  

If you are an average diner looking for great value for a decent meal I highly recommend this place.  The employees were all pleasant and kind.  I had the buffet breakfast for $15.99 and I definitely got more than my money's worth.  Check it out yourself and don't be biased by others bad experiences as if I did I would have ended up paying over $30 for a meal based on location and brand....not necessarily because it was better than this place.  I would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"The staff seemed pleasant, knowledgable about the menu and were very fast at delivering us our food and drinks.

Unfortunately, I knew something was wrong when I saw no cap on the syrup, and a patch of fruit flies hanging on the wall beside it in our booth. It looks like an IHOP, only much crappier and scarier.

I ordered the crepes, because I love crepes! Three crepes for 8 bucks? OMG what a deal!! The crepes were a great size, the batter was fantastic- until I got to the filling... 

Have you ever been to the fair, and ordered a funnel cake? Or DQ and ordered a strawberry sundae? That strawberry syrup that the poor over saturated strawberries are submerged in...that's what these crepes were filled with. Gooey, messy, plastic tasting cheap syrup. Don't get me wrong, I like it in small doses (eg. Funnel cake) but my crepes were oozing this sad excuse of pie filling. I felt sick and somehow powered through two of the three just to be nice.

I noticed they had two awards hung up from 2006 and 2007. I can say those times have well passed. Next time I'm grabbing something from the Loblaws across the street and just eating it on my way home.

I also want to mention that my lemonade tasted like orange juice. I don't know...how that could have happened."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. The place is very old and grimy, the food is basically tasteless and dry. The service was fine. Worst restaurant I have been to in a long time, not sure how it is still open. Wouldn't' go here ever again."}
{"text":"This place smells of aged chip fat and should be avoided at all costs lest you be seen in it and have your credibility completely ruined.  It really needs a revamp. There are so many more attractive places to get breakfast, but it is open 24/7.  Eat here if you have finished washing windscreens at a Gardiner Expressway off-ramp or  pan handling on Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Find (or make) some children. Go to Golden Griddle. Order the breakfast buffet. Enjoy.

I brought my 2 younger siblings here for the breakfast buffet. The food was good but not great. The desserts had been bought from the grocery store. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired and the place is rundown. Regardless, we had a great time. My siblings loved the instant gratification and huge amount of choice of the buffet. 

A great option for kids. I wouldn't go on my own but I'll definitely take my siblings back."}
{"text":"Food is sucks , and pricey staff  doesn't know the answer to my question. I tried to get an an oatmeal and I asked the guy if you have hot water for the oatmeal and he told me in a polite way the 'I don't know '  what kind of answer is that .? I'm not gonna eat the oatmeal raw. 
I will never come back  there at all .  Guys your running a business and it's seems that your not concern about the food you serving ."}
{"text":"Hey let's call a spade a spade, this place sucks BUT you get what you pay for.  It's cheap and the food is edible. 

I love their buffet.  People knock this place, but I will always go if anyone asks.  And it's seriously the best party in Toronto at like 2:30 am on a Sunday.  Great after bar crowd."}
{"text":"Horible place we went with friends once and the whole experience was bad.
Food is terrible and when we told this to the guy im charge he said: its fine if you not coming back we are busy enough.
The place is old uggly. Go up one block and eat at Cora."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from here with just eat.  Simple order of mozerella sticks and fries.  Somehow on simple order they screw it up and send wrong food after an hour and 15 minute wait. Not only wrong but ice cold. Id hate to see wjat they do with a complicated order.  They are not equipped for this.  As well no one knew how to fix it because their mamager went home.  Stay clear"}
{"text":"My girl and I suffered a grueling Sunday morning workout at goodlife and decided to treat ourselves to a semi-healthy breakfast aftweards. 

We both went with the hearty appetite options, a Country Corner Breakfast for me and a Peameal option for her. We skipped the toast to not overload but we did try the pancakes (french toast in her case).

THE GOOD

I gotta say the  service here was great. We were seated quickly. The wait staff was all smiles and suggestions. The coffee kept coming and coming. No issues here.

THE BAD

The actual food is not at all appealing. The pancakes were overcooked, the bacon and sausage were completely dry and tasteless. The eggs and peameal bacon were alright, as were the homefries, but everything tasted pretty generic and plasticky. 

THE UGLY

I can't say I went in there for flavour but nothing was made better than I could have at home and that's my hard fast rule for determining whether I wasted a dining experience or not.

And the portions were stingy. Three eggs are three eggs, but the other sides of protein were tiny. Enough for us figure-conscious girls but misleading for other patrons. 


I RECOMMEND: Trying Boom Breakfast or even Sunset Grill. 

EXTRA TIP: Not substitution friendly. We wanted more meat instead of toast or home fries and they could not accommodate us."}
{"text":"Ah, the Griddle. Ah, the sweet smell of nostalgia.

Service? Great. Food? Not so good. I'll stop in here occasionally still, but it's nothing like it used to be. Or hey, maybe I was just an easily impressed child."}
{"text":"Have been there several times in the past but now it's closed permanently . 
At times food was ok although service was good didn't like the \" plastic\" hollandaise sauce it really screwed up the eggs Benedict or the extra charge for real maple syrup.
If you are in the area go around the corner to the Sunset Grill on Yonge N of Eglinton or go to Boom on Eglinton W by the park"}
{"text":"I've always walked past this joint and finally got the chance to go in for breakfast.  It's a pretty big place and when i was there on a weekday, it was quiet.  
The menu was pretty extensive with non breakfast entrees as well.  Most notable was their fish and chips what with the featured posters visible on the wall.  However, i decided on breakfast that consists of scrambled eggs, sausages, ham, bacon, toasts and pancakes.    It was a huge breakfast for $14.99. 
The waitress was nice and attentive.  She was always there to refill our coffee and water.
Overall it's a nice place to go to for breakbast."}
{"text":"Don't understand why this place was empty and Cora's busy. First, service was great at GG. Next, the food was good, large portions, they did not skimp on the bacon for my BLT and they even left the pitcher of water at the table."}
{"text":"My family and I walked past the Golden Griddle and noticed the front door was chained. I asked the security guard walking around why the door was locked. He told me the restaurant was closed permanently. I was bummed."}
