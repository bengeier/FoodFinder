{"text":"It sure does not look like much from the road, but once you walk in and smell the barbeque you know you have made a wise decision. The owner/chef is extremely friendly and loves to welcome you in person. His one goal is to make sure you are satisfied. The helpings are very generous and the steaks, ribs, pulled pork and chicken are just fantastic. Another location we have introduced many friends to and they have all become regulars. Small and cozy, certainly not a big dining room but well worth the trip."}

{"text":"I was not impressed by this restaurant at all.  We stopped for breakfast one morning.  The service was SLOW and the food was mediocre.  I love breakfast and find it hard to believe the food wasn't good.  It is a small restaurant and I would think they would be able to make good homestyle breakfasts and serve it really fast...I was wrong."}
