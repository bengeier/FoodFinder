{"text":"Tacos were on point. They were good and the salsa was spicy. Cooked over a real charcoal grill (not those briquettes you buy in the store). Price wise, I would have expected $2 per taco would have been a fair price but they're $3. Being Scottsdale I guess you just have to expect to pay more, I can get just as good if not better tacos elsewhere for cheaper."}
{"text":"fast service , best taco . Most deff check this place out if your in Scottsdale, highly recommend this place if you wanna taste tacos identical to tacos in Mexico ,"}
{"text":"I'm from Sonora, Mexico and I can say that the steak taco from Mezquite is the only closer flavor to tacos de carne asada that I could recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite, definitely the best tacos I've had in AZ! I like the fact that it has a self-serving salsa bar and everything is made fresh right in front of you. The staff is super friendly and they are even open late for a late night fix. Definetely a must try, if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Almost gave it a five....just becuase its different than your standard.  We need more of these before Trump puts up the wall and forbids authentic tacos! Not a fan of the chicken tacos, steak was excellent with the mesquite taste. I would prefer a good corn tortilla.  Salsa was excellent and not hot at all......i tried every salsa they had.   For sure going back."}
{"text":"Menu isn't real extensive, but the tacos and the toppings were on-point and definitely hit the spot.  Definitely a place to hit up for its convenience and food."}
{"text":"Tried 1 chicken and one steak. I had to go back for seconds. The food was amazing. Defiantly felt like I was eating tacos from rocky point. If I could give it more stars I would!"}
{"text":"What else can I say, from a Missouri guy out on business in Scottsdale, WOW!  Best damn tacos I have ever eaten in my LIFE!  The open flame grilled skirt steak over lump mesquite...  mmmm mmm mm"}
{"text":"Wow - beats any  fast food Mexican by a long shot!  Wife had tacos and I had a chicken burrito.  Soooo tasty.  Service was fast and friendly.  They even have a salsa bar.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the tacos here. We have never had a bad experience. We come here basically every weekend when we get off of work. Since it's late at night there are few places with decent fresh good food... Of you are looking for some great tacos. Come here!!! Salsa is a little hot some times. Yikes"}
{"text":"Simple menu, yummy tacos. I had the steak (carne asada) ones and found the two I ordered to be quite filling. Everything is to-go and there is no seating."}
{"text":"Best street taco place I've been too since living in Arizona! The workers are very friendly! I definitely will be back and eating more delicious tacos!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  I love the tasty Carne Asada tacos.  They even put cheese on them unlike many places.  I love the green avocado sauce as well. Mmm mmm mmm!!  Pay only $1 for extra meat, it's worth it!! 

Staff is friendly and always fast!!"}
{"text":"Minimalist bliss for the street taco fan. Actually their tortillas are a bit larger than most street tacos. Fast, fun and delicious at $3 a pop with terrific pico de gallo! Irresistible!"}
{"text":"AmaZing taqueria. Order and go. Very flavorful because it's cooked on coal. They have many sauces you can put on after ordering to dress your own. A must go if you're downtown."}
{"text":"This place is over rated. I got the mix and the meat was chewy and needed more seasoning. The extra was hot sauce, shredded cabbage and pico de gallo that also needed salt. I won't go there or recommend this place"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that as a Mexican male who has done nothing but support my local taco joint, they are beyond disappointing. Last night I was late to the show so they ran out of meat. Tonight I was disrespected and asked to wait. I sent an assistant still disrespected. Concierge at a local hotel, Mexican, I no longer recommend this Taco SHIT"}
{"text":"These are very good. Quick, easy and not super expensive. Wish they had somewhere to sit, but \"street tacos\" like these are where it's at!"}
{"text":"I cant belive i stumbled upon this hidden gem! They only have two options on the menu chicken and steak. I tried 2 chicken tacos with cheese. After eating them i had to order 1 steak just to try. It was unbelivably outstanding! Only down side was the line was a little long. Other than that its a must try!"}
{"text":"They have the worst tacos in town. I waited in line for an hour and was disappointment. You know the tacos were nasty if I was drunk and I did not like them. To top it off the staff are liars. And they change the price according to if they know you are not sometimes your tacos are $3 sometimes your tacos and $2 sometimes your tacos or 1.50 it just depends on if they want to be your friend or not. I would never go to this place ever again Filibertos has that that are tacos and customer service"}
{"text":"Street tacos on the street in the middle of the best bar scene area in Scottsdale. These guys told me they served tacos until 4 am the other night! I don't ever stay up that late any more. In fact I do get up that early sometimes, but anyway... these tacos are the biggest three dollar taco you'll ever get anywhere, I went back for lunch last Wednesday and I put down my tailgate and ate my street tacos for lunch right on the street, what a deal. Anyone who says otherwise is being a typical \"butthead Yelper.\" This is my new lunch stop for a quick lunch in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I went here today and the place formerly known as Wadaa Street Tacos has changed its name, so I'm just going to repost my review from the other name....

I'm a fan of authentic street tacos and this is a great place to get them. They grill the meat right in front of you, so the whole place smells great when you walk up. The tacos are tasty and I can easily eat 4 or 5 for lunch. It's truly just a hole in the wall, and there is no place to sit, so be prepared to find a spot on the sidewalk or take your food somewhere else.

Oh, and don't get the red sauce on your fingers and then rub your eye or you'll be looking for an eyewash station pretty fast, LOL.

P.S. I'll bet these tacos taste even better after a night out at the clubs in the area!

Oh, and for those complaining that the tacos are expensive maybe you should look around and recognize that you're in Scottsdale, not the avenues!"}
{"text":"The chicken tacos were absolutely delicious! I could not believe how great they were for only $3. I will most definitely be going back. The only downside was there is no where to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"The best freaking street tacos ever!!! And they're only $3. I don't know why people don't go here more often. They have a bit of a fly problem, but their tacos are so good!!!!!  Only reason I give 4 stars is because of their service (they don't speak much English and their fly problem), but the food is superb! I come here quite frequently!"}
{"text":"My first time at this taco shop this afternoon. Gabriella was very friendly and the tacos are to die for! So good, fresh tortillas and juicy flavorful meat. I will most definitely be back.... again and again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Simple, quick and authentic tasting. Corn vs flour tortilla both delicious (get four!)"}
{"text":"These tacos probably tasted way better because I was tipsy. After a night in Old Town, a random stranger named Izzy highly suggested that I try Mr. Mesquite. The location is conveniently located near the bars. This hole in the wall taco place is nothing more than drunk food heaven. Their three easy options (chicken, steak, or mixed) are strategically made for people with drunky face. Thye also give you the choice of adding on pico, lime, and lettuce yourself. Overall, I've tasted better and tasted worse. Not the worst choice after a night out at the district."}
{"text":"These are second-rate tacos. My two carne asada tacos were 75% fat.  You got two meat choices, but carne is fatty and the chicken is mixed meat. No grilled onions and peppers are available at all either. The condiments include bottles of sauce that sit outside for hours and mushy pico de gallo. Not even good food for drunks."}
{"text":"Such great tacos! Ordered two carne asada tacos to go, and was blown away by how great they were! Definitely a place to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of a hole in the wall, but you can expect to get some of the most authentic and delicious street tacos here. They have $2 tacos on Tuesdays, and you can choose between steak, chicken, or both. These are pretty filling too -  I'm usually happy after eating three (I don't know how someone could consider 10 tacos a snack). If you go on any day aside from Taco Tuesday, they're about $3

They offer beans and rice too, but you'll probably be happy with just the tacos. They have a little bar at the counter too where you can pile on some salsa, lime, and cabbage as well."}
{"text":"My new favorite Mexican restaurant. Solid steak with a flour tortilla option and they take credit card."}
{"text":"I thought the tacos were really good at Mr. Mesquitte street tacos. They are conveniently located in old town and are the perfect meal after a day or night out. I had been there twice. They were more generous with portion size one time versus the other. All in all I thought it was very good and fair priced."}
{"text":"The best tacos I have ever had. When I got back to LA from Scottsdale the craving was so intense I didn't have a taste for anything else. The steak chicken gringo style is"}
{"text":"Food is on point, the employees don't seem to care if there is a line piling up, they just continue to move really slow. But the food doe."}
{"text":"Really good tacos, just expensive.  I'll defiantly go back but if they were a little more reasonable I'd go back a lot more!"}
{"text":"This place was called Wadaa Street Tacos until recently. Its original location was here at 7345 E Shoeman Ln, Scottsdale, AZ 85251. Other than the signage nothing has changed except that on a Thursday at 1 pm they had way too much pre-cooked beef so it lacked the strong grill flavor we enjoyed last Feb when we were here. The heated flour tortillas were great as before as was the lettuce, pico de gallo and key lime bar on ice for garnishing the tacos.

Looks like they either sold the business to the cook who is the same guy that was here in Feb or they took the Wadaa name for a new location they are opening farther west in Phoenix (2510 West Thunderbird, phoenix, AZ 85023) and trying to grt a head start on having good reviews from the Scottsdale location. The new one needs to establish itself on its own merits so be forewarned if you go to that listing and see hundreds of reviews many of them referencing the entertainment district here just east of Scottsdale Rd."}
{"text":"Not the best tacos in the world but when you trashed everything taste good. This place is super packed once all the bars and clubs close. Get there before the line starts and hopefully won't get diarrhea. Fingers crossed lol"}
{"text":"Super tasty tacos! Cute little area but kinda hard to find. Also was expecting there to be little table or something but there's nowhere to sit. But still good food!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical when we walked in, and they were out of a lot of stuff (quesadillas, and some sides), however they made up for it by making us 2 small quesadillas on the small tortillas used to make tacos (for free), and restocked everything that was low for toppings. The tacos themselves were VERY good!
Tasted just like authentic street tacos. Definitely recommend. We also got a few free taco coupons, they definitely value customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I think it is important to start this review by letting you know that I lived in Texas pretty much my whole life therefore I am 100% a taco snob. This place just doesn't not measure up to the taquerias that I am used to, at all. It would be a 1 Star establishment but honestly they are opened late which allows them a little more leeway because once the clock strikes 1 am I basically become a Dyson vacuum that will eat anything in my path. 

Alright, let's get down to business and talk about the tacos. The tortilla is either flour or corn, I've had both and am not really impressed with either. The flour is too large which doesn't sound like a negative except the integrity of the taco is totally lost and it is basically a soggy, floppy mess that breaks about very easily. The corn runs into basically the same problem and anytime I have eaten them most of my taco has ended up on my lap. The meat tends to be tough and barely seasoned. The pico de Gallo and lettuce are kept on a little bar cart outside the establishment in the Arizona heat so I always feel like they are going to make me sick or start a new strain of E. Coli infection to sweep Phoenix/Scottsdale. 

Basically what I'm saying is skip it"}
{"text":"I think these tacos are just alright. Kinda bland to be honest. Not bad by any means. Only steak or chicken choice.

They put so much cheese on them by default, haha.

They are pretty big and filling though."}
{"text":"These tacos are so good THE best tacos I've had and I've traveled the United States I've had tacos from everywhere these are the best! Wish they had sour cream but tacos taste so good still finished 2 had one chicken and one steak couldn't choose with was better lol."}
{"text":"Tacos are fantastic great price the chicken and carne asada mixed are the best short wait times authentic Mexican food a must have."}
{"text":"Terrible, flavorless tacos and flavorless orchata ..wadda tacos was the real deal... Nothing had salt , salsas and aguamoloe were terribly unseasoned, same with the meat .. blah."}
{"text":"Best steak tacos I have ever had!!!! The steak was tender and very flavorful. I want to know their species because this was done right. Almost like it has been marinated for a long time and simmered to perfection.

Chicken was ok. A little bit on the dry side but still good. But I'll put my money on the steak any day!

You have three options; chicken,  steak or combination."}
{"text":"Definitely didn't need these tacos. Just hours earlier I had eaten a pretty sizable dinner, but the combination of a couple drinks and the smell of mesquite smoked meat resulted in a pretty damn good bad decision. 

There's not much to Mr Mesquite, and that's kinda what I like about it. Just your choice of protein on a tortilla. You won't find fixens other than a few salsas, but with carne asada cooked this well you don't really need them. 

It is a little pricey at $3 a taco, but I guess I can understand how they came up with the price point. Between hours that are open extremely late and the amount of drunk people in this little pocket of bars, I guess they figured people would pay whatever price tag they put on them."}
{"text":"Good flavor. On a bar/club street. I like my food hotter but the flavor was there. $3 a taco sounds a bit overpriced to me but they serve you in a styrofoam takeaway tray. A simple paper plate would have sufficed but I would buy another. :)"}
{"text":"Don't be afraid. These tacos were incredible. Real street style tacos. No seating available. Great flavor. Try the red sauce if you like spicy. I had wished I had gotten more of it."}
{"text":"I was walking down old town Scottadale on a Tuesday night when I stumbled (not literally) onto this place. I was hungry and tacos would hit the spot. It was a very SIMPLE menu, which I loved... 

Chicken, Steak, or Mix. That's it. Perfect. 
No long decision menus where you stare at it for 20min.

And they were only $3 ($2 on Tuesdays). Great price for the amount of meat they put on, and self serve cabbage, salsa, and limes.

I was only visiting but if I was living here this would be a place I would go often."}
{"text":"You will most likely stumble your way over to this location around 2:30am. When you're so hungry you can eat a cow, but probably just a bit tipsey. The main item is a street taco (chicken, steak, or combo) that you have to dress yourself.  What is a 3 bucks a taco compared to the $20 shot you just paid for? Usually a line on the weekends but moves quickly. Wouldn't be sober destination for me."}
{"text":"$3 Tacos.  Great value for the money.

Good healthy food for cheap prices.  They give you the tacos (steak or chicken) and you put on the fixings (pico de gallo, cabbage, lemon, hot sauce).  

2 tacos were all I needed to fill me up.  That's with all the fixings of course.

Too bad they don't have one close by me.  Would eat here constantly."}
{"text":"Decent Tacos, Good Flavor, High Priced For the Size

So the tacos here were pretty good but $3 a piece someone my size needs about 10 of them to get full makes for a $30 snack... 

Location is decent though it's an easy pop away from all the night club life that people are partaking in.

It really is pretty much a little street taco shop so there is no seating, bathroom or any fixtures other than a counter at a sidewalk."}
{"text":"Drunk people disclaimer: 
just get the steak, don't load up on the red sauce it's HOT"}
{"text":"Literally the best tacos. I'm here every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday and EVERY TIME I am more than please with the service and quality of food. I absolutely love going there"}
{"text":"It's effing delicious! Just like the streets of Mexico. Nuff said! 

Hole in the wall, walk up, sidewalk counter. No seating but you didn't come for seats. Their simple menu covers the basics. Tacos with chicken, steak, or both. They have a topping bar with salsa, lime, and cabbage. You can also order rice/beans and you can ask to pay for extras like grilled onions and peppers. I haven't tried the rice or beans but I imagine they are good. The pepper and onion are worth the extra $1

Pro tip: Taco Tuesday discounts $2 per taco. ~$3 per taco normally.

This is a great place to grab a bite or to feed the munchies while you're hitting up the Old Town nightlife."}
{"text":"My wife & I love to come here for breakfast on weekends. Her favorite is steak, mine is chicken. Which ever you like, they're seasoned & cooked perfectly every time and they are very generous with the meats."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I had in a while. It had really good ingredients and flavor. The flavor is probably the thing that did it for me. And yeah, some pricey tacos here. It's kind of like you pay the premium for this good stuff. I would take someone here if they really wanted good tacos."}
{"text":"This place is a weekly go-to, and a spot I always take out-of-town coworkers when they're around. Very, very good tacos for a great price ($2 on Taco Tuesdays). They are also served very simple - tortilla, meat & cheese, and they set out several salsa, cabbage and excellent pico de gallo with jalapenos. They're great for lunch, great for hangovers, probably great after drinks too."}
{"text":"Your tacos might be some of the best I've ever had in Arizona!  Seriously!! I work close by and no longer can even go at lunch because the lines have gotten so long. I'm happy that so many love them too. If you haven't tried this little gem out.. make sure to add it to your list.  The taco Tuesday deal is way worthwhile..$2 tacos. Just expect a little wait.
I will see you next time."}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago and it was great, but now the service is terrible and the tacos are mediocre at best. I really hope I just came on an off night or something because it has far more potential than what I got tonight."}
{"text":"Although the food is good the service sucks. I tried to order tacos on Taco Tuesdays and I was running late. I had a 5 mile drive to only make it before 12:00am. The guy told me I need to order 30 tacos in order to make a phone order. Got there at 12:02am and he told me no I just missed it by 2 mins. I guess working in old town people can treat you however they want."}
{"text":"I feel like this plays is definitely over hyped. We came here while staying in Scottsdale. We tried the Jamaica and Horchata neither of which tasted good, they were both sour. The tacos were huge but the meat quality was not too good. Their were a lot of cartilage pieces. The salsa was decent. I've eaten a lot of tacos in my life and these tasted a little Americanized to me."}
{"text":"You get to choose between Delicious Chicken or Delicious Steak tacos (or quesadillas if you want more). These guys are constantly chopping veggies and meats to keep up with the constant stream of customers.  If you are skeptical about their tacos then visit them on $2 taco Tuesday to ease your woes. These guys are great and their staff is friendly as well. Nothing will compliment your bar crawling more than a delicious and smoky Taco."}
{"text":"Not bad overall, but not what i was expecting. Thought they would be more for $3/taco. Decent late night food, but didn't blow my socks off."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best tacos in the area - I feel the food is more authentic Mexican style and taste. The place is very simple and super cost effective for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I wish there was something like this in Chicago. We are talking about the second you're out of the club and BAM! TACOS! A girl was dreaming out in AZ. I was there for Labor Day weekend and went out 3/4 nights and went to this place 3/4 nights. Don't get me wrong it was not the cleanest but it did the job. The tacos were good but the condiment area was a mess hence the drunken fools that surrounded the area.. Maybe they can find a more cleaner way but in the mean time it'll do."}
{"text":"I have always loved mr mesquites.... until I felt completely degraded by an employee tonight... my friend went to give my roommate her key and when he returned... the employee decided that we had to buy everyone in line food that he \"cut\". So we paid for their food. I am so let down and disappointed..... It is great food but none of us will return to buy food from them ever again."}
{"text":"we went after a night out even the girls that didn't drink at got horribly sick I miss the old wadaa taco stand"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I was craving some street tacos and found this spot close by. I ordered 2 chicken tacos and 1 carne asado taco. The meat tasted very old, especially the chicken- almost like yesterday's chicken that was reheated today and put on my tacos. I had a bite of each and almost feel sick, they were disgusting. 

I tried the sauces which were not bad, but with old meat there isn't anything you can do except not eat it in order to avoid getting really sick. The best part of the tacos were the flour tortillas and even those weren't great. 

Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, great value, BYO wet wipes if you eat there on the sidewalk ;-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I got the Chicken, Steak, and Mix tacos.  We went on a Tuesday when it was $2 each.  Really good - my husband said he'd never had chicken tacos so flavorful.  I felt like the Steak was a bit overcooked and their mango drink wasn't good at all, but I would go back.  The only downfall is there are no tables or places to sit.  They said we could go next door because the restaurant is usually cool with it...but when we went there, the lady said we needed to buy a drink before we could get a table."}
{"text":"Been looking for authentic street tacos in the area and Mr. Mesquite Street Tacos is great. It's quick service, fresh, and reasonably priced. Also, they put a decent amount of meat on the tacos which is always nice. Will definitely return when craving tacos in the area. 

It's just a pop-up shop so there is no seating, either have to eat in your car or find a spot to squat to eat. Also, parking in the area might be hard to find on  a busy night."}
{"text":"Growing up on the border of Mexico I know a good taco and had yet to find a place that compares to the tacos at home UNTIL I TRIED THIS PLACE! These street tacos are the best I've had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos!!! This place is my go-to for quick and cheap tacos! I don't eat meat, so I get beans, rice and cheese with guacamole. I usually pick my own toppings from their stand. (cabbage cilantro, onion, lime and salsa). Their tacos are $2-3 each and they even deliver :D"}
{"text":"I really liked my food, my husband not so much. It was a bit of a walk to get to, and did really feel very safe. Would I go again, no, would I recommend, no."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Salsa is spicy! Not many restaurants let you have as much guac as you want for free! I come here each time I'm in Scottsdale! They taste even better at 2 am after a night out"}
{"text":"I love the tacos here, they are simple and delicious. It smells so good when you get close, like when someone is barbecuing next door. They use real mesquite charcoal it smells so good and gives the food that great flavor. I add grilled onions they are sweet and cooked perfectly. Don't forget your Mexican coke!!"}
{"text":"I love that they havent increased their prices since taking over from the previous place and the quality of food has gotten better. Nice for a quick bite"}
{"text":"The steak tacos are on point! Price to quality ratio here is pretty spot on. Fast, cheap and tasty food. I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Just get the steak

Its really that good freshly grilled in front of you and cut it up for your taco. 

The menu is very simple because they do one thing very well , tacos. 

Chicken or steak
Bottled drinks
Hot sauce and toppings

Extra meat or extra cheese 

The end"}
{"text":"These tacos are great if u are pissed drunk and can't find anything else to eat.  Otherwise stay away.  Lol.  Tastes sort of like dog"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall spot. No tables to sit. To go only. 3 choices on the menu. Chicken, steak or mix tacos. $3 each. 

I ordered 2 tacos. 
1 chicken 1 steak. 

The steak was better than the chicken. However both tasted good. 
 
I like the fact that they put cheese on them. 
 It's a dollar more for extra meat and another dollar more for grilled onions. That's not good. 
The tacos are normal size. About 6\". Not the tiny street taco size. 
Was it worth the price? Kinda. A little in the expensive side but I think the area has something to do with it. 
Would I eat there again? Maybe, there are better places than this but If I'm in the area I would. 
Would I recommend it? Sure, give it a try."}
{"text":"FAVORITE TACO PLACE! So glad I happened to come across this place. They have a very basic menu but the tacos are cheap and so good. I go here all the time now. Only downside is that there is no where to sit, but it's not a huge deal as I just take them home."}
{"text":"It was Tuesday and of course I wanted some tacos. I was in the neighborhood and yelped this place which was near by. Tacos were only $2. Maybe because it was Tuesday. 

I really wanted to sit and enjoy my tacos, but it was only a walk up window. But well worth the heat of standing outside to wait for my tacos and then sitting in my air conditioned car. 

I ordered 3 tacos. One of each of the types they offered. One chicken, one steak and a one mix of both. Although they were flour tortillas and there was cheese on them; I enjoyed every bite. I mean, I wanted authentic street tacos, but this more than satisfied my taco Tuesday craving. A must do! 

And the Jamaica drink was cold and refreshing."}
{"text":"I Love this place!They literally have the best tacos in town!

I eat there quite often and won't go anywhere else for tacos.

My friends that were recently visiting out of state loved their tacos as well!

Staff is always very friendly especially the guy that is always there with black hair (not sure what is his name but he's there in the evenings).


Keep up the good work guys!


If you haven't got a chance yet to check out this place you definitely have to!"}
{"text":"Great tacos! Very simple and affordable, the meat has a great flavor. $3 tacos are better than some of these upscale Mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"The tacos are average AZ tacos.  Meat is often times dry and as AZ tacos are in Scottsdale, they're expensive.  The tortillas are store bought and you can tell.  There is no real quality to the taco but, mixed with alcohol, it's the best damn taco you'll ever have.  

5 stars because they are similar to McDonalds in the sense that you know what you're getting into before you go.  Want a gourmet taco? This ain't your place, want a real Mexican asada taco? This ain't it.  Want a quick lunch taco or a post old town drunken love session with some food because you couldn't find anyone to take home (I'm all about the run-on)? This is your place."}
{"text":"They changed their name from Wadaas! I liked the name not sure why that happened. Employees are friendly. The salsa is super hot so be careful, and I love spicy food just sayin. I get carne Asada and chicken on corn tortillas great for lunch if u work nearby"}
{"text":"This is the best street tacos we've ever had since Mexico! We loved it so much we can't wait to come back to Scottsdale for this place."}
{"text":"Shady.. $5 written with sharpie on cardboard over their menu because they were busy. 

Street Tacos for myself and 2 friends: $72"}
{"text":"Even though they have Corn tortillas on the menu,  everytime I order them they say they don't have any, very frustrating considering I can't eat flour tortillas! Would definitely be higher rated if they could get it together!"}
{"text":"3.5

For $4 for 2 tacos on Taco Tuesday, what do you expect? I expected some satisfying street tacos with a bit of char and the desire to eat more of them once I was finished. My expectations were met.

Yes, you can guarantee that you aren't getting premium cuts of meat. Yes, my tacos included both fat and gristle. But... it was $4 for 2 tacos on Taco Tuesday. It is what it is. You could do a lot worse for a relatively satisfying combo of corn tortilla, cheese and mixed meats (with accompanying fat and gristle). This is perfect drunk street food and that's exactly the demo Mr. Mesquite is targeting. 

However, I was sober. Hence rounding down to 3 stars. But, I'm not mad at them. Again: $4. 2 tacos. Taco Tuesday. It is what it is."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious steak and chicken tacos. They're ginormous, loaded with meat and cheese and made with soft, warm corn or flour tortillas. If you're craving tacos, and cruising old town, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Now I know where to go for taco Tuesday. I got recommend the steak and chicken mix. Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've EVER had! Very simple place, you literally have a selection of three different types of meat as you could see on the menu I've provided. Very fast which I like! Self serve lettuce, salsa and other things you want on your tacos. 

Street parking, no seats or tables, just stand and eat your awesome tacos!"}
{"text":"This is a spot for people that are going to the bars but it is perfect. The chicken is the best. I felt like the steak was a little chewy and wasn't as good as the chicken which is surprising. There is a small line but they are fast. There is no where to sit so you have to stand and eat your tacos or go to your car."}
{"text":"Hard to find good tacos on the go that aren't overly greasy, lacking in flavor or downright questionable. 

Mr. Mesquite knows how to make tacos properly. 

You won't find any fancy or wild flavors here, they keep it simple char grilled chicken or steak with the usual toppings; lettuce, pico, guacamole, lime and spicy salsa. Been here many times and they've tasted just as delicious as before. 

Very yummy and fast!"}
{"text":"So I came to this place like 6 months ago by accident. I was a t Dierks Bentley that night and I needed a break from all the drugstore cowboys and affliction wearing toolbags so while walking around outside I stumbled on this little gem.. Yes, that night I was a tad intoxicated but every bite seemed to be like I was biting into a mythological taco that everyone had just talked about and  nobody had ever seen or tasted... Well since that wonderful night 6 months ago ive wanted to go back, and I Finally did last night.. This place sells pretty damn good tacos. I gotta say I have had many tacos and there is very few places in Mesa/ Phoenix area that makes them this delicious. Its a little store front, no seating outside you just buy your food and either eat it standing up or wander down to the pizza place nextdoor and buy a water there. They will let you sit at their outdoor tables. I got 4 tacos and since it was taco Tuesday they were only 2 bucks each and my wife got 2 carne asada and 2 chicken (I ate her chicken tacos). I am in love with these tacos, they are simple but the flavors are amazing. Their spicy hot sauce is delicious fantastic and will have you drinking some water to numb the burning. They have a toppings table which again is simple but has bomb flavors. I would go there literally and day between Sunday - Wednesday... Stay away on weekend nights, this place gets slammed and youll be lucky to find any parking and lines are super long. ALSO THEY HAVE CORN TORTILLAS, YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK FOR THEM!"}
{"text":"Open at 10 a.m. daily and we think tacos may just be the breakfast of champions, judging by all who stop by that early for a taco pickup (after a hard night on the old town?) These are very good if you like authentic tacos without a lot of fuss. They offer chicken or carne asada on a single corn or flour tortilla. Two tortillas are not necessary as they serve them in a large Styrofoam, lidded box from which you can scoop up anything that falls out of your tacos. Add an extra tortilla and they might charge you an extra dollar, so you can get by with one. Each taco is served with cheese. Self add fixings include half pony limes, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and two red chilli sauces (hot and medium, the latter which has more lime flavor). There is also a green sauce which may be green chilli or tomatillo based--I haven't tried it. They serve an ample amount of meat on each taco that sells for about 3 bucks. The only downside to this place is that there is no seating, but then, it is a true street taco eatery, a walk up eatery on the sidewalk, and they don't seem to mind if you hang at the service counter to eat it."}
