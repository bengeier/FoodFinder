{"text":"This place is pizza joint but at night the Mexico comes out and the tacos begin a Jem in a dozen  it's something you would just have to try your self but make sure to come after 8 to try there tacos and it's open till midnight"}
{"text":"An Italian themed sports grill??? OK, whatever works.   I eat here pretty regularly. The owners are very friendly and will bend over backwards to help you see whatever game or sport you want to watch (they don't subscribe to all the Direct TV channels so, they may not be successful in getting your particular game).  The wings are absolutely the BEST wings on Earth!!! I have had wings all over the country and these are the very best. The pizza is basic New York style pizza with thin crust and grease but, very good. The hamburgers are excellent as are the Philly Cheesesteak and Calzones.   For a Mom & Pop shop, this place is pretty good. I would decorate with a sports theme and get a full liquor license but, it's up to them."}
{"text":"Nope. Started with flat, warm beer.  We were the only patrons.  Each meal came out individually... 5-10 minutes apart, except the first/last three meals.  First to order, last to the table, after taking the order a second time (once all other meals were served).  Server denied forgetting to place the original order and obviously brought them out after placing them a second time.   Entire ordeal took over two hours for ten people.  Luckily no one else was there to distract the wait staff and prolong this miserable experience.  Insult to injury, no acknowledgement or apology for inconvenience.  Apparently, this sort of disservice is commonplace."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Baked Ziti I have ever had.  Watery, unbaked, sloppy mess.  My daughter and husband both ordered burgers, both were horrible, and the fries were somehow burned black and still soggy.  Should have known better when there was literally no one else in the dinning room."}
