{"text":"My family loves a particular nearby fro-yo place (Kokomo), but we wanted to try something new.  Sadly, it just confirmed we need to stick with what we love.  Yes, Tasti D-lite offered a huge menu, but it was not worth the price.  The place was empty, so that should've been the first sign.  It didn't have a great ambiance inside, and the fro-yo didn't taste that great either.  We will be sticking to our regular treat store."}
{"text":"Yuck!  I've been to Tasti D-lite several times and have always found it to be below average.  The taste and quality of the yogurt is poor and they charge a premium price for a very mediocre product.  There are so many better choices in the area!!!"}
{"text":"WAY OVER PRICED for moderately good ice cream. not accommodating for kids in that you have to spend an extra 50 cents for all the \"fun flavors\" (which consists of a squirt of syrup).  they only offer the medium size for the fun flavors, as well. the atmosphere is boring and doesn't offer much seating. i'd rather spend my money on a simple yummy vanilla cone at cooperate mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Great crew. 

Awesome alternative to ice-cream or frozen yogurt. 

Crazy good flavors. Never disappointed. I may need a second job to support my Tasti D-lite habbit. Well worth it people.

{"text":"I am currently a student at Hamilton High School and have been to multiple fundraisers for clubs at Tasti Dlite. Every time I go I enjoy the experience of picking out a flavor and being with friends. But I don't actually recommend the frozen yogurt. It's not as \"Tasti\" as they claim...

My mother, who visited another time said it tasted \"watered down\" and I agree the taste is not as strong or as savory as I would have liked it.

Just down the road is Frio Mio, a much nicer place. I prefer their yogurt and service. They have much nicer workers there who are willing to help. I don't like how many of the frozen yogurt places I walk into have people sitting behind the counter, lazily staring at you as if you're ruining their uninterrupted work hours."}
{"text":"they do have a wide range of flavors.  I got the chocolate peanut butter and it wasnt that great....I don't think its worth the price."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check this place out ever since I noticed something was finally taking over the old Jamba Juice location.  I was expecting this to be one of those self-serve fro-yo shops that seem to be cropping up all over the Valley.  Well, this isn't self-serve or yogurt, but I wasn't disappointed.

The first thing I noticed is the giant menu of custom flavors on the wall, ranging from Tiramisu to PB&J.  All of the custom flavors are mixed Blizzard-style into their soft serve ice cream--which perhaps would more accurately be called an \"ice milk\".  I ordered the Peanut Butter Fudge on my first visit to the shop a few weeks ago, and it was fantastic.  On three occasions since then I've gone back: twice I've ordered one of their PB chocolate custom flavors (confirmed to still be delicious!), and once I tried the \"Green Tea\" ... which unfortunately just seemed like green vanilla soft serve, without any discernable tea flavor.  

While it is a little pricey for soft-serve -- about $4.50 for a regular-sized cup of a custom flavor -- I'm sure I'll be back.  I already have a PB chocolate habit!"}
{"text":"Great spot for fro-yo in the East valley. Family run joint and the last of the Tasti D-lite's in AZ. Would definately go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"WIth so many options for frozen yogurt and ice cream within a three-mile radius of this location, Tasti-D-lite is pretty close to bottom of the barrel. What promised to be a unique idea turned out to be rather pedestrian. The actual store's hours did not match their websites -- which is a bummer if you walk there and find them closing when you should have had another 30 minutes or hour. But maybe they were closing because they had no customers and just didn't want to stay longer. The frozen ice cream/yogurt (whatever) they sell does taste pretty good, but doesn't explain why they charge $4-to-$5 for a cone. This is Chandler, not Scottsdale. And for that matter, why would a cone cost that much in Scottsdale anyway? Healthier dessert options are to be applauded, but I'd really like to see stores go out of their way to serve our wallets as well as our waistlines."}
{"text":"I've been disappointed lately with the daily flavors....they don't have enough flavor to them anymore.   The staff is great but they need to LOWER the prices and add more flavoring to the daily soft serve flavors."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the customer service Kellie provides is second to none!!!  The store is so clean and just is a great place to sit and relax with something good to snack on!!"}
{"text":"Neat little frozen yogurt place. The flavors change all the time from what we found out. I would recommend trying the flavors to make sure. I had the NY cheesecake and it was very good. The prices are a bit high, but they have specials that make up for that. Free WiFi also made it a nice little place to hang out.
The only downside were the chairs. They need to have some type of stoppers on the bottoms of each as the noise from the chairs sliding on the floor was grating."}
{"text":"Do I have to give a star?  Zero stars is my true rating.  Horrible service. Not a tasty product.  Way too expensive.  Nothing positive to say about this place.  We spend our money at Frio Mio and Kokomo - much much better options!"}
{"text":"SOOO delicious!!  We go here all the time, even get the quart sizes (call ahead to order them, it takes them a while to make the larger sizes).  It is a little pricey, but we use our \"tasti\" card, so we get free yogurt or money off of our order often.  Our favorites are \"peanut butter marshmellow\" and \"oreos and cream\".  Their cakes are really great too!  They know us here and it's our favorite frozen yogurt place in town! :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best frozen yogurt ever. Lower in calories, good quality natural ingredients. Very refreshing on hot day working deliveries. Didn't get that over sugared feeling.

Another huge plus, daily specials. Customized flavors to create anything you'd like.

Great supplement and smoothies options. My number one choice for a frozen treat!

Price well worth the quality, especially for a foodie that practically lives at the farmers markets.

I returned today 8-1-12, 2nd time this week, with family in tow. Really good again. The creamiest ever. 

I also noted mistakes by other reviews. Dry toppings are only $  .50, fresh fruit is $ .75. 10 varieties of fresh fruit. Very reasonable. Some other chains are more. Flavor and quality excellent. 

We tryed two other frozen yogurt self serve chains in the last year, once each and never returned."}
{"text":"Of all the flavors I have tried here the best is the vanilla. It is tasty but way over-priced. I couldn't believe they actually charged an extra 75 cents for sprinkles. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Very disapointed went to this place after picking up a pizza from a new local New York shop next door and thought whats better than ice cream after pizza well was sad way OVERPRICED  and like all the other reveiws no flavor ???????"}
