{"text":"Got the spicy bhuna gosht (lamb) and it was delicious. Good amount of heat and lots of different flavors. The staff was incredibly friendly and offered to let us try the naan bread on the house after we ordered rice. I will never order rice there again because the naan is just too good and it's absolutely huge! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bombay has a place on Green Street which is campus oriented, plastic table tops, styrofoam service, and fabulous food. After trying it for lunch I went to the 1st street place with my spouse. The setting was beautiful, the service was great without being pushy, and the chicken tikka Marsala and the lamb biryani were the best they could have possibly been. 

I've lived and eaten in Champaign Urbana since 1972 and Bombay is the best restaurant in my experience, bar none. 

The food is mild, not \"too much\" curry, just nearly perfect. A must go-to restaurant.

I have since back for dinner and again for the lunch buffet. The dinner was oustanding once again but the lunch was a bit overpriced for what you get. Bombay is still the best restaurant in C-U."}
{"text":"I don't know about the Green St. location, as I've never been there. I have, however, been to this location many, many, many times since it opened. There have been times when the food was superb. There have been times when it was \"Meh.\" We have had great service and not-so-great service. Generally, however, the level of food quality was such that it was always worth the crapshoot. The roller coaster became part of the lore of this location.

That ended about six months ago. This location never bothered to renew its liquor license, they stopped investing in the decor which has, predictably, become progressively shabbier, it's always cold, and the food has taken what looks to be a permanent nosedive. The staff is...bizarre. There is one guy who is always there who can't be bothered to do his job. He literally forgets to come take your order. We know this because he says, \"I forgot to come take your order.\"  Which would be barely acceptable if it was his first day. Not, say, the 5th or 6th time you've had him as a waiter. The other waiters are always new. There must be a revolving door.

We have finally come to the sad conclusion that this location is not worth it any longer.  This is a shame, because there was a period in there where we came in once a week, happy to have good Indian food in a non-campus atmosphere, in Champaign. There is better Indian food sold pre-packaged in the grocery store."}
{"text":"This place is so good, but at the same time so pricey. The portions are also pretty small. As in, I never have enough for leftovers to take home for future meals unlike many other places I go. 
I've only really had a few of the curries, naan, and one of the fried triangular things (made from chickpea batter and something else) but every time it's been delicious. I have cravings for it every now and then. 

They have waiters here, which I didn't expect from a smaller restaurant like this. 

I think I would come more often if the prices were a little lower."}
{"text":"Despite the small seating availability of the restaurant, the food at Bombay Indian Grill is huge in flavor.

While I have only eaten here several times (and ordered typical dishes - chicken korma, biryani, saag, jalfrezie), each time was a pleasant experience. The food is loaded with flavor and portions are fairly generous. As other yelpers have commented, make sure you get the naan bread - it is absolutely fantastic. 

The dinner menu differs from its lunch menu in that serving sizes are slightly greater, as is the price. Waiter service is also provided so tipping is common practice as well. Prices in general can be a tad on the expensive side, so I generally only eat here occasionally."}
{"text":"Tasty food. My favorite was always chicken makhani. Sometimes the manager would give me additional nan (some kind of pita bread but much more tasty) for free. The price is low and you will always end up as full as it gets.

Seating was sometimes a problem because the place is kind of small, and it is so good that it gets crowded.

I moved away from Chambana to the south west. I have been in some other indian restaurants but no one compares to Bombay Grill regarding taste. I miss it."}
{"text":"So nice to get great Indian food in Champaign-Urbana...  While from Chicago and am spoiled with great Indian food, I am perfectly happy with the level of quality when visiting my boyfriend In C-U....   

Yum."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat in C-U.  I come from Boston, the land of 100 Indian restaurants.  I fell in love with Indian there, and was very wary of moving to a tiny midwestern city.  However, Bombay definitely hits the spot.  I like the typical curry dishes, chicken tikka masala, samosas, naan - all are great here.  My husband is a bit more adventurous and he has never been disappointed.  Granted, it's not better than many of the places we've been to in Boston - but it's way better than I expected for around here!  On the down side, it's pretty small and very crowded around lunch time.  Good luck finding space for more than just 2 at noon!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am a food snob from Los Angeles. Just moved here and to be totally honest  I think the food here is so plain. Yes, you have a lot of great steak places and American food but things such as Sushi ( there is NO good places I have tried each and every one) and Indian are hard to come by. We first went to Basmati and honestly I thought we were doomed. There was no flavor and most dishes seemed to be watered down. NOW, we were driving near campus and we drove by Bombay and I am more then happy we stopped. As for the other poster whos friends said its over spiced, have you tried real Indian food? This is tame in comparison. The food is just right and always served fresh and hot. The semosas are great and served with the best sauces. We love the Gobi Aloo and chicken masala, we will be back to try other dishes. Bottom line other then the lackluster decor and sometimes dirty looking floors this place was a sweet treat for those of us who are used to some variety!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but it is pricey and the service is awful! If you want to be treated with respect and to receive your food sometime thus century, don't come here."}
{"text":"Ordered online and the food came delivered and some spilled out but it was really good!! I just wish it didn't spill out. My only complaint. So driver, easy on them turns!!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend the lamb curry which is spicy and comes with fragrant basmati rice. The naan is really great too. I also enjoy the aloo tikki appetizer, as well as the samosas. I am not an expert on Indian food so I can't tell you how authentic it is, but I can tell you that it is delicious."}
{"text":"Good food overall!! Offers a wide variety of dishes to pick from, and all the vegetarian' curries taste good. I would rate it a zillion times better than the lame 'Basmati' that it used to be earlier. However, i wouldnt recommend any dish that involves meat (chicken/lamb). I auways end up finishing the whole dish, leaving all the meat aside. It feels like huge, bland chunks of cisco meat that taste no better than rubber had been dumped into the gravy/sauce/curry that you ordered for, and then served. Now i stick to vegetarian food when ever i visit this place.

Note: good cust service."}
{"text":"This place used to be much better, it really has gone downhill in the past year. Perhaps the best comment I can muster is that it's definitely better than Ambar, which  is really not saying a whole lot. But if you must have Indian food, and have no possible way of getting to Race St. in Urbana for good Indian food, then I recommend Bombay Grill."}
{"text":"Eating here was a Christmas present in itself...

I had Indian roommates during grad school,  and during this time, Indian and Sushi became my comfort food. On my return to Central Illinois, quality Indian and Sushi became difficult to find- so I'm glad we decided to try Bombay Indian Grill. 

The waiters at their off-campus location wear black ties and white shirts- and performed the service of 'waiter' extremely well. 

This is a very very good Indian restaurant. I'll reserve more detailed descriptions to my 'foodie' friends, but you'll enjoy this restaurant, especially if you're there with friends. 

It's a great place for a slightly above-casual date.  Guys- remember to use the side dish for the dipping sauces for the papadams (~chips). You don't want to mix the appetizer sauces with your main dish. However, if you do forget and use your main plate, the waiter may replace it for you. They're that good."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of Indian places and I love Indian food. I must say, I was very pleased with this place, especially given its location. The food was delicious and pretty authentic. I gave it four stars because the service was so-so and there was no ice in the water."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, the food here was OK.  The naan was good.   The service was terrible.   He seemed annoyed when he had to come over to our table, there were only 3 other small groups in he restaurant.   He asked me 3-4 times if I wanted the spicy dish and didn't once come to our table to see if we needed anything after the food was served.   The food was ok, nothing that couldn't be found at any Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"You get MORE than what you pay for at Bombay Indian Grill. The service was excellent. The food hit the spot. We ordered a couple of curries and it came with rice. Our waiter even offered more if we ran out. Usually one has to pay for any rice. The generous portion of naan bread was tasty and the creamy rice pudding was yummy. We will go here again before looking around."}
{"text":"I think for cheap Indian, it's hard to do better given its city (C-U).  It's not top shelf Chicago/big city Indian or anything, but it's very good.  In particular, I think this location is better than their sit down restaurant, as it serves very similar food but is noticeably cheaper.  I've had a lot of different dishes here and wasn't really disappointed with anything.  Particular favorite is the saag paneer and spicy chana aloo."}
{"text":"Sub-par Indian food, which passes in town. How is that there is no good Indian food in Champaign-Urbana? There are so many amazing Korean and Chinese places. The food here is generic and bland. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is still in business is because nostalgic desi students will do anything to try to get a taste of home. I know this because I am one of them. I walked into this restaurant hoping to finally have some homestyle Indian soul food, like the curries and masalas my mom makes. I walked out with a severe case of food poisoning. It took my stomach two days to recover from this fiasco. This happened not once but twice, the second time I went to this awful establishment was when my friend cajoled me into accompanying her for lunch, and since it was her birthday I grudgingly accepted. I decided to play it safe, and get the mildest dish on the menu. But to no avail, just twenty minutes after I left the restaurant I was hit with another wave of food poisoning. 

The only thing worse than the food here is the price, both times I went I payed over 15 dollars, basically to get food poisoning. The taste of the food also is off, the chicken I had there tasted old, as if it had been sitting out for a while. Gross. The customer service is good and the people are polite, but they are not nearly nice enough make up for the lamentable quality of food served. 

This place doesn't even deserve to be called a restaurant, it is a disgrace to the good name of restaurants everywhere."}
{"text":"Bombay has been one of my favorite restaurants in Champaign for almost 5 years. It's dark and cozy inside and smells of masala and fresh yogurt. It seems to be popular, too, because every time I have gone it has been absolutely packed -- but I've never had to wait long for a table, and usually there is no wait at all. They also give you so much food, and I always have enough left over for lunch the next day. Great selection of vegetarian entrees, too, for those that are into that!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, terrific. The only reason I would give it a 3 star because the light system in the evening there is absolutely terrible.. I could hardly read my menu there at night.."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in CU.  Their Naan is the best Naan of all Naans I've had - and I've had a lot of Naan.  Chicken Tikka and Lamb Curry are my favorites.  With a mango lassi expect to pay around 15 bucks after tax and tip."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I NEVER had a bad meal at the location on Green Street.

However, the problem started when Bombay moved into the old Basmati's restaurant on 1st.

For all intents and purposes, this restaurant is Basmati's all over again.  The decor was exactly the same.  The waiters seemed to be the same too.  However, would we still have the same bland food that made Basmati my least favorite restaurant?

Well, yes and no.

Even with an expanded area for cooking and serving, the food is identical to the location on Green Street.  Wait, no, not identical.  The main courses cost about $3.00 more than on Green Street.

Of course there's the addition of alcohol on the menu, but the location on 1st doesn't afford you the great meal at a low price that the Green Street location was so good at."}
{"text":"First time - and last. Food was good, but overpriced. $10.99 for weekday lunch buffet is too much. That's without drink. Then the tip was added to the price making the total with tax 3 cents under &14. Adding the tip for a group of 6 is in poor taste. Probably it was done because of so many waiters, almost as many as there were customers. The buffet was self-serve - the waiters just poured water. I don't even want to look at the dinner prices."}
{"text":"Overpriced and just ok quality! I think most of these positive reviews are from people who have little experience with authentic Indian food..."}
{"text":"Generous portions for lunch. Well-seasoned and tasty. Nothing fancy, but very good and affordable."}
{"text":"I adore everything about Bombay!  I tend to eat mainly vegetarian, and the options at Bombay are numerous.  The weekend buffet is loaded with savory and spicy vegetarian dishes and some meaty stews as well. The cold salad bar has lettuce and the usual fixings with Indian dressings (yogurt, tamarind,etc.)  There is also a fantastic cold chickpea salad.  The naan bread is the best I've ever had.  The hot part of the buffet includes soups, tandoori chicken, several  vegetable stews, and sometimes they even serve goat meat.  Desserts are different and good.  I'm fond of the sweet Cream of Wheat with carrot, and the sweet vermicelli pudding.  Service is attentive almost to a fault.  I think the price for the buffet is a bargain considering the quality and quantity of food offered.  I also love the attractive,clean, and comfortable interior, the cosmopolitan mix of customers, and the easy and ample parking."}
{"text":"Very solid Indian place.  Was recommended to me by an Indian friend who had tried the different Indian restaurants.  We were all impressed with the food.  Spicy Mix Naan was great.  None of the food was very spicy, but I'm sure you can request more heat if you want it.  Service  was quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"don't get me wrong--i absolutely love this place.however, my only complaint is the same thing someone else mentioned: the service. true, there are worse things than overly-attentive service, but when you've got 12 different guys coming up to your table literally every three minutes to fill your nearly-full glass of water or take away silverware you're not done with, it gets really annoying. i know, i know, it could be worse, service-wise, but it's...well...annoying. 

that said, the food is excellent, and right on par with what you'd find in bigger cities. i've never had a meal here and come away disappointed. plus, with them having handed out 15% reusable discount cards, who wouldn't be pleased? hell, just writing about it makes me want to go ;)"}
{"text":"The food was ok but definitely there's better places where you can get good Indian food in C-U. And I agree with the previous posts: If you are a female and like to be gawked at, I HIGHLY recommend this place for you. The staff stare like they have never seen A WOMAN before. Very DISTURBING!"}
{"text":"The food is just average Indian food, nothing special. What's terrible about this place is that they use styrofoam plates, cups and bowls and plastic forks and spoons. Even when you eat in. The food isn't cheap enough for that. At their prices they could buy a dishwasher and serve their food on real plates. I love Indian food and work nearby but I'll go somewhere else so long as they serve everything on styrofoam."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic Indian food with a great buffet at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is dam costly and is not at all worth for the food they serve. I am Vegan and Paid $13.2 for just 3 types of sides and naan bread and custard. Food was ot worth more than $6 however we were shocked to see their heavy check. Food is not so tasty to admire. It doesnt have the true authentic Indian food taste. They make sides of potatoes and green peas which are cheap in market to keep their profit margin high. They are smart enough to rob people. Please try other Indian restaurant who give you many option to eat for less than $10."}
{"text":"This is the new, off-campus (yay!) and more fine dining Bombay, and I have to say, it is fantastic.  It's in the old Basmati building, and they are doing a wonderful job of bringing their delicious food to the non-student crowd.

They've only been open a couple weeks and seem to have everything down already.  The service was perfectly attentive and the food was amazing.  They bring out an Indian version of chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal that was really good.  Their Naan is some of the best I've had, and the Tandoori lamb was so wonderfully tender that a butter knife was more than sufficient to cut it.  Everything was perfectly flavored, just the right temperature, and the portion sizes were right on the mark.  Our bill for two was about $40 and included appetizers, extra Naan and drinks, so the prices are very fair.  I was really stuffed by the time we left and still had plenty to take home.

The owner stopped by at the end of our meal to see how we liked everything and to tell us a little about his restaurants and business philosophy (ie, made to order food using his father's original recipes), which I though was a nice touch.  I sincerely hope that this new location takes off, as it certainly deserves to!"}
{"text":"i know indian food.
how ? well, you can use your imagination.

B.I.G scores on the lunch - 6.99$ daily special, you get to choose between rice and a naan (i always get the naan, cuz it's always good). But other than that, it's not the kind of place where you'd go 4 times a week as a student, not even for lunch, because outside of the daily special, it'll still cost you about 9.5$. And that it still cheaper than Dinner. 

Which brings me to the not so hot part - 15$ Dinner for one, you better hope you're not a student."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great deal for dinner! For two entrees and an appetizer, the check was about $26, which is pretty good for two people -- and we were stuffed. The food is delicious, the portions are decent, our glasses were always filled with water, and service was prompt.

Only two negatives, no liquor license and the atmosphere is a bit lacking. It was a little too loud and a little too crowded, but it's a good place for casual dining."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I call this 'our place' because it's that good!

I think our waiter knows us pretty well by now and know that we like the homemade cheese on the side in addition to our meals! It's not really on the menu, but if you ask for it, you won't regret it!

I also never fail to get the Chicken Korma because the creamy sauce is just too yummy."}
{"text":"The food isn't terrible. That is the best I have to say. We cook Pakistani and North Indian food at home all the time, which is what this ostensibly is. Every damn dish tastes the same here. This type of food is supposed to be rich and nuanced, and every dish should have its own set of flavors that make it unique. I really wonder if they just have a base curry sauce in the kitchen, and throw whatever combination of meat and veg in when they get the order. I'd rather eat my own versions, thank you very much, and I'm not even the desi half of the household!
Go to Annapoorna grocery, buy some spice box mixes, follow the instructions on the back, and you'll probably do better."}
{"text":"I had never had Indian food before trying Bombay Indian Grill.
I decided to expand my pallete and try out Bombay.

Let's just say I would eat her 2-3 times a week if I could afford it.

I love their tandoori and their chana masala. That's pretty much what I order each time I come. I'm vegan, and it's nice having a lot of options to choose from on their menu.

I've brought friends and family here and everyone else has loved their meals.

Try Bombay and you won't be disappointed.

I will say I prefer their campus location (even though it's much smaller) because the staff is friendlier. One of the servers here can be pretty rude. He once took my dish before I was done with it and I almost said something but it didn't seem worth it.

The one Indian man that I have seen here (he wears a turban, kind of young looking) is pretty nice and has spoken to me every time I have come in to eat.

Come here for the food but not for the service."}
{"text":"Really disappointed today as I ordered a Bombay mixed biryani for takeout during lunch hours. As I am paying for it I notice I am being charged dinner price and I remark isn't it a lunch special right now. I've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price. The person/owner then remarks it is a dinner biryani which has me really confused since I've ordered it for dinner as well and there is no difference from what I've experienced. As I get home i open the box to see that it's actually only half full. So if I am paying for a dinner portion why is it even less than a usual lunch portion. Very disappointed by this experience."}
{"text":"Brother took the malay masala chicken , i took the lamb biryani, the seller is very friendly! Very welcoming!  
I didnt finish the lamb biryani, perfect flavoring 
The malay masala was good too!
He gave us a naan on the house too"}
{"text":"Really great Indian food, just a few blocks from campus. For a quick lunch, it's a great amount of excellent food for a good price. Their naan is fresh and flavourful, and they were great at customizing spiciness levels for the various American/Indian palates in our party. A little bit of a small restaurant, their second location on 1st is bigger and features a lunch buffet for the less-adventurous. However, the Green St. location had a variety of great food options, and a Himalayan chicken special that was divine. Great place to meet and catch up, but can get crowded when students/classes are in session."}
{"text":"Went to the First Street Bombay Grill location and was shocked--it's under new management, and it shows for the worse. No familiar faces; no liquor license any more (!); and a totally inept management of the tables. We were made to wait around 20 minutes to be seated in a restaurant that was nearly 65 percent empty and that remained empty for the duration of our stay (in other words, it wasn't as if they had hordes of reservations to accommodate). 

The food wasn't nearly as good as it has been in the past (they also gave me the wrong entree, but I didn't say anything because we wanted to get the heck out of there). We won't be back, alas, although I might still consider ordering takeout. I have no idea if the original cooking staff is still there, or what...feels less like new management and more like entirely new ownershi"}
{"text":"I've only come here twice and both times it takes them over 25 minutes to prepare our food to go. I always forget but if I decide to come back I will definitely order ahead of time. There also isn't any air conditioning in the restaurant which makes eating the spicy food almost impossible at the restaurant so I have to take it to go. They are always nice and the food is good. I'm just not big on going into the restaurant. I need to just start ordering for delivery and delivery only."}
{"text":"Nicely seasoned paneer and enormous naan.  Very good and reasonably priced.  Only con is that they serve it on styrofoam plates which isn't very environmentally friendly.  I'd be back once a week or two if I lived on Champaign."}
{"text":"Now I don't have much of a history with Indian restaurants, but what little I do has not been very good. So when coworkers suggested \"Indian\" tonight, I was outwardly on board but internally a little skeptical. After having Bombay Grill--well, my attitude's all different.

Nothing special about the decor; it was all about the food! For starters, papads (fried chips made from lentils) and samosas, complimented with green chili and plum sauce. As an entree, I had the \"Lamb Aloo Ginger Curry\"--sticky rice came with it. Ordered some naan, which held it all together really well. Wash it all down with a Kingfisher lager. Seriously, purrrrrrfect.

I walked in unsure, feeling a little off. I left Bombay Grill totally excited about Indian food. Yeah!"}
{"text":"For my grad program I have to spend a few weeks in Champaign every year. When I'm there, I go to this place all the time. The food is great, and it's really cheap at lunch - for $6.99 you can get an enormous amount of your entree, plus either the biggest piece of naan in history OR a giant pile of rice OR some of both, plus a couple pakoras and a salad. What? Fabulous. And it is more than enough food to last for two meals, which is another huge plus.

In case that weren't enough, they frequently give me free stuff. I don't totally understand why. I'm not really a regular, and I'm not a supermodel. If this place were on the east coast, I'd guess it was because I'm polite, but this is Champaign, where everyone says \"please\" and \"thank you\" and smiles. So...I don't really understand it, but every time I go there, I get some of another entree, or an extra piece of naan, or a dessert, or a soda. Maybe everybody gets free stuff. Whatever. I'm not one to look a gift daal in the mouth."}
{"text":"If I could give this more stars than five, I would. It is a phenomenal restaurant. I have only been here for the buffet. Usually, they have about 8 entrees with a mix of Veg and Non-Veg. The Naan is to die for. I haven't tasted Indian food so delicious and authentic since I was in India. If I could afford it, I would eat here every day."}
{"text":"AMAZING LUNCH SPECIALS! 

I've heard both Bombays and Casablanca are both owned by the same people: but Bombay is the place to go for lunch! You and a buddy could get away splitting a dish for $8. Very cool! 

The food is pretty good. Not the best in town (Casablanca or that new one in Urbana is better), but good enough for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I am praying that I had an anomalous experience.  I came here on a Sunday not realizing that there was an all-you-can eat buffet that costs around $16 without tax (expensive for a student).  Fine, whatever, I was there already - but the food was cold and not great, especially for what I paid.  My favorite dish is the saag paneer and it left me lacking.  The naan was also disappointing because it was cold and chewy.

Even worse, the mango lassi was not fresh and you could tell they used some mango syrup.  Or even if it was real, it was sickeningly sweet.

No thanks."}
{"text":"I've been to Bombay Indaian Grill a couple of times now and everything I've had there was delicious. I've gotten the Bengan Bartha (spicy eggplant) and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower with potatoes), both of which were very tasty with a side of naan bread. The only reason I'm giving them 3 stars instead of 4 is because the food is overpriced: $10 for a small cup of stewed vegetables and naan bread... Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.

Overall, I like the food there but because I don't like feeling ripped off, I probably won't come back too often, unless I'm in the vicinity and have an extreme craving for Indian food."}
{"text":"The various kinds of naan are very good here. The biriyani being served is definitely not biriyani but it can be called good pulao. Mango lassi is OK. If you are looking for authentic Indian food, stay away from the non-veg curries and kababs please. But did I mention that the naans are good?"}
{"text":"Other than emerging out of this restaurant smelling like curry, there are no drawbacks to the deliciousness that is Bombay. You have to get the naan here, it is a non-negotiable. I usually go for the chicken-stuffed variety, but I know that all the other kinds are equally delicious. The curry is perfection, as are the lamb kebabs. Delicious food and quaint seating."}
{"text":"OK. 5 Stars might seem weird, BUT for the mid-west, this IS as good as Indian cuisine gets outside of Chicago. It is such a HUGE step up from the previous Basmati owners in the same building, I can't believe it. The food is absolutely delicious, with generous and interesting portions. I LOVE that they regularly serve a Goat special, it is always amazing. TOTALLY a fan. Like, totally."}
{"text":"I reviewed this in 2009 to let people know that I got food poisoning here. I ate here again and am rating it more highly cause I ate the veg food and it was fine, but mostly because I highly approve of the quantity and quality of their rice.  Working class Asian Americans like myself love their rice and this place is super generous and the quality is very very good. Better than the entree itself in fact."}
{"text":"Bombay India Grill is definitely the best Indian restaurant on campus. The taste is closest it can get to an authentic Indian meal. Try Dal Makhani with Onion Kulcha!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I have liked both to the things I have ordered. First time I tried the Chicken Tikka Masala and the second time I got the Chicken Tikka which is really similar to the Tandoori Chicken but boneless. I was surprised by the amount of chicken the latter had. Might not be the BEST indian food in town but it is well located and affordable, definitely going back.

P.S.
The naan is huge and really good!!"}
{"text":"Food is always fast and fresh here. And I've noticed the naan has gotten considerably larger since I last set foot in here in early 2007. But I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"We shared Chicken Aloo Curry which came with rice ($9) and added a side of naan ($2) to go. The place was packed, dimly lit, and casual. The service was quick and the food was flavorful and fresh. It was not too spicy. Menu is standard Indian cuisine. A-OK."}
{"text":"I have no pretensions to being an expert on Indian fare, but Bombay does what it's supposed to do: fill your belly in a reasonable fashion while remaining tasty. The naan is fluffy and delicious, and any of the chicken dishes (I've tried several), are excellent.  However, the lunch rush is pretty intense, and the staff make no bones about letting you know that they are not there to indulge in your lunch hour relaxation.  Expect to see your plates taken away and your table cleaned as a *hint* to mosey on along, partner.  Seriously, a bit awkward to have my table wiped down in mid-sentence.  Still, decent food for what it is, a tiny lunch factory in Campus Town."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Indian place in town, and for the sit down restaurant experience, it's definitely great.  I'd recommend it for the atmosphere, the prompt and reliable service, and oh my god everything from Chicken Korma to Lamb Saag has BEEN AMAZING.  So yes, go.  Now."}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic Indian food if you're in Champaign/Urbana area. I normally like my food really spicy, so I had to ask the waiter for a recommendation and their spiciest dish. She recommended bhuna gosht, and it was at the right level of spice for me. My friend had a chicken tikka masala since she can't handle spicy food, but both dishes tasted delicious and buttery flavor-wise. Their naan is big enough to share with 2-3 people. I just wish they make the portion size for the entrees a little bit bigger."}
{"text":"I had a mango lassi, the buffet, and spent the rest of the day praying to the porcelain diety.

Im sorry. The proximity of this place to campus means that you need to take the other reviews with a hefty grain of salt. The food here is typically  not fresh, oily, and of poor quality.  Students seem to like anything that they didn't get in their home town growing up, but as indian food goes, this place is poor.  I have watched the quality steadily decline over the last several years, and the last time i went was for a candidate interview visit, so i had to go since i was on the interview schedule for lunch, i was physically ill for a day with food poisoning.

I will never go back.

Students continue to eat there, and thats fine with me."}
{"text":"One of our go-to places for lunch.  The portions are generous to the point of ridiculous and the prices are very reasonable.  The naan bread is fantastic.  Most of the options for lunch are great, but for me the standout is the chicken aloo.   There's something for everyone here.

Dinner is when they bust out the cloth napkins and nice dinnerware, which honestly takes quite a bit away from the experience for me. Definitely hit this one up for lunch. Also don't forget they close midday if you have to eat at weird times like I do."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food you'll find in Urbana-Champaign.  Growing up in India and spending more than a decade in New Jersey, I have had luxury of trying out Indian food at many places (incl. home!!).  The taste of the food is authentic, not too spicy, but not at all bland.  True art of Indian food is to use variety of herbs and spices in a way that it enhances the taste of food, but doesn't dominate the overall taste. Many Indian restaurants either are afraid of using spices or carelessly overdo it.   Bombay Grill nails that aspect, so it gets five stars from me. 

Besides the taste, the food isn't that expensive for an Indian restaurant standard.  We tried weekday buffet last week.  For $11 + tip + tax, it had enough varieties.  Some really good, some right on mediocrity, which is very common with buffet. Their butter chicken and tandoori roast chicken are worth trying.  Saag paneer is phenomenal for those interested in vegetarian options.  Lunch buffet had probably the best naan I've tried in many years.  They are freshly baked and new ones keep coming worm and fluffy from the kitchen. Judging from the buffet food, I can confidently say that a la carte items would be a bang for your buck too!!

Next time will try dinner and see if it's equally satisfying as the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Went for the brunch buffet. Good value for 11.99. Would visit again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for lunch. The Bombay Chicken Aloo is my go-to dish: I usually get it with na'an (flatbread). The na'an is HUGE and you can dip it in the sauce that comes with the chicken dish. Service is quick and the staff is friendly. I've been for dinner once and it was a bit too expensive for a college student. Still, the food is reliable and delicious - check it out!"}
{"text":"Bombay Indian Grill is one of those places that turns its city block (without much else on it) into a feast for the senses.  The spices alone floating out of this place is enough reason to head on over.  And generally the food is pretty good, my only complaint is that I've gotten what I think is food poisoning from this place twice (namely, I'm 100% a-ok prior to the meal, and then about 30 minutes to an hour after, I'm sick as could be!).  That's not always been my experience, but it has a few times, and I think it's something to point out.

One of my favorite things here is the warm, toasty (and yes, buttery, like all good ;D) naan.  I mean, I'm pretty sure it's everyone's favorite.  They do a Tiki Marsala that's ahhhh-mazing, especially with the rib meat chicken that's tucked inside it.  So good!

While I agree with some of the other patrons, the service can be a little lackluster, the person who owns it is truly nice.  

The restaurant is spacious, and well maintained, but, unfortunately it's starting to show its age.  It has been quite a while since they've updated it (I'm not sure it's ever been updated, to tell you the truth).  

Regardless, if you're a fan of the Indian cuisine, and have an urge for a Marsala or a Curry, you should check them out!  On their best days, they're amazing!  Unfortunately, on their not so best days, you might expect a problem or two. =X"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food, with lots of veg options.  Absolutely delicious naan and their paneer is some of the best I've had.  Yummy mango lassi, though more sour than I'm used to.

Solidly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the food in here! But the price is a little expensive compared to another Indian grill on green street."}
{"text":"me thinks not...i bought the chat - 2 kinds and chicken 65...the chats are both packed with broken samosas just different spicing wtf...it was literally the same thing except one had yougurt while the other didn't...the chicken 65 was more of a chinese chilli chicken than anything else but they give u a huge portion for the price, so worth it...it was pretty good, the people next to us bought naan and curry. the naans looked yum...if i return ill return for the chicken and naan NOT for the chat"}

Ok, heres my \"live blog\" review: 

    Well, the interior space at the first street locale is certainly not the \"lavishly Indian-decorated\" space at the top of their website. Perhaps that is the campus location that looks that way? But i thought the first st. location was supposed to be the fine dining one? Maybe that dining room is in the back? I can't imagine a restaurant would use an image that is not their actual space at the top of their homepage.  It sure lured me in. Anyhow, as I sit here waiting for my lamb curry and basic naan (in silence as there's no music playing whatsoever contributing to the growing lack luster ambiance), I'm hoping it lives up to the $16 price tag (w/naan). Some ice cubes in my water would be nice. Certainly so since its just barely colder than room temperature.
  Okay, the waiter just brought my food. Wow that's a pretty small bowl of lamb curry. I may have to hit a fast food joint on the way home. Here we go.
  Well...that bowl is deeper than it looks judging by the fact that i spilled some over the edge of my smallish plate. Ok...putting down my fork long enough to type that this is a damn good lamb curry. DAMN GOOD! I'm glad I specified I wanted it medium hot. The heat is perfect. Any hotter would've been too hot. Any less so and it would've been lacking. The aromatic spicing is really really good. The lamb is good too. Decently tender (fwiw, I've never had a lamb dish where every single piece was perfectly tender but this is close). And there are plenty of pieces. I was really worried when I saw that bowl but the portion was quite generous. 
  --(Just heard the table across the room say to the waiter that their daughter is extremely allergic to nuts...seriously? And you're here with her?  You're gonna trust that an errant cashew doesn't fall into the the pan while her dish is prepared? Really? But I digress...)-
  The naan is good. Hot and fresh. A smear of butter or ghee or whatever it is that some of my favorite places sometimes use would've been nice. 
  Should mention the basmati rice. Very good and very fresh tasting. Of course I'm herd right as dinner service started up so that's to be expected. 
   Ok...Kheer here we go. Good kheer. Better than many, not as good as my favorite kheer at an otherwise mediocre indian place downstate. But none are. 
   In summary, I'd say the food was very very good and priced about right for the quality. Since you can't really enjoy Indian without naan you pretty much have to add three bucks to whatever entree you're looking at. But thats most Indian restaurants nowadays. If the naan was included or if the ambiance was better I'd have no qualms giving this place five stars. Maybe the CD player is broken, but some Indian music in the background would help tremendously. And ice cubes in the water and icey refills.... Small stuff, but for $18 bucks plus tip after I ordered my kheer, that stuff matters. 
   Will definitely come back next time I'm in town. And will try the buffet. Maybe as soon as tomorrow!!

 ***UPDATE- went to the buffet the today...the naan brought to my table was excellent. Much better than last nights. Had the butter or ghee on it. Tasted very much \"fresh out of the oven\" unlike the naan at last nights dinner. Consistency is key! Strange that it would be less fresh at the dinner service. Granted i was there right at open...but good grief, open at five thirty if its the difference in getting fresh baked naan and something reheated.
    As for the rest of the buffet, it was good. Everything was hot and fresh. The saag was good as was the dal. The chicken korma so so. Not nearly as aromatic as some of the better kormas I've had. Lacking in other ingredients too...seemed like just chunks of chicken and a cream sauce. It looked and tasted more like the \"average\" tikka masala than the kormas I am used to. The tikka masala was less than average for me. Even though I typically am not a tikka masala fan I have had dishes that I've liked a lot. This literally looked and tasted like they used heavy doses of ketchup and red food coloring in its preparation. If that's what you're used to for tikka masalas than by all means order it. 
   But again, I have to stress how incredibly excellent the lamb curry was. Strange that the korma and tikka would be so lack luster."}
{"text":"I've eaten Indian all over the state, and this place remains my favorite. The portions are generous, the prices are low, and the food is vibrantly flavorful the way Indian should be. 

I actually worked here for a summer, and I can honestly say I've never eaten better in my life. All day and all night my stomach was a bubbling cauldron of curry. Try the vegetable vindaloo- I put it on the menu!"}
{"text":"There is a long standing debate between my friends and I over the best Indian restaurant on Green street. Unlike Chinese food here, there isn't much competition, so it's basically Bombay vs. East and West. East and West is completely vegetarian and leans towards Southern Indian style snacks, whereas Bombay Grill has heartier food  and has a more formal dinner.

I think some of their dishes are a little overspiced, but the Tandoori chicken is absolutely divine with a crisp skin and the perfect amount of seasoning. I only wish it came with more chicken and less of the lentil side and gigantic naan. Don't get me wrong, the naan here is great, but more of that chicken would be better. 

The service is quite slow and it is pretty expensive, so I reserve going here for when I really need a treat."}
{"text":"Amazing naan great sauce very good service. One of the best Indian I've had out of dozens. Good amount of spice on the malai kafta and good raita.  Great lamb curry too! Did I mention great naan"}
{"text":"This used to be a decent Indian restaurant, but the last time I went (mid-summer), the food was so greasy it was practically swimming.  I hope it was a one-time thing, because I'm not inclined to go back, especially now that South Indian food is available in Champaign."}
{"text":"I've eaten from here a number of times during my college years.  Last time I ordered the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan.  The garlic naan was nice and warm with plenty of garlic bits and good garlic flavor.  The chicken tikka masala was nicely seasoned with spices and a good amount of chicken chunks.  Definitely a satisfying meal.  While the food is delicious it is a bit on the pricey side for college students like me.  Worth it yes, but not something to eat regularly on a college budget.

This location has a buffet which the Green Street location doesn't, but I can't comment on the buffet, although I've heard good things.  Also this location seems to have slightly higher prices than the Green Street location.  Probably due to the better ambiance in comparison."}
{"text":"OMG I'M SO FULL BUT I WANT TO KEEP EATING.

When the food comes out, I always think it looks small but I get filled up so fast and I always have to take home my food.

I've been pleased with each visit I've made here.

Unfortunately, I don't know much about authentic Indian food so I try my best. I don't even know what I ordered so I end up trying something different each time!

For my most recent visit I ordered the \"Bhuna Chicken Saag\" which is a hot Chicken entree. I can taste the spice but it is not that spicy. I don't need to take a drink of water or nothin', ya know? It is still deliciousss, the vegetable portion is good, I mix it with the rice. The chicken is tender & juicy. I'd say it's about 3:2 vegetables to meat.. As it should be.

BASMATI RICE. YUMMMM. In my culture, eating rice everyday is normal. I can only wish we had that delicious Basmati rice everyday.

I also ordered the \"Onion Kulcha\". I've had their \"naan\" & \"tandoori roti\" as well. All I can say is WHY ARE INDIAN BREADS SO GOOD? These pieces look like pizza & you get full after one. It's weird.

Complimentary lentil chips come with your order before your food comes. They taste good. Don't really do anything for your hunger lol. The red & green sauces that comes with them is bomb. I wish I knew exactly what it was but I'm too shy to ask.

Their buffet is also really tasty. There isn't TOO MUCH of a selection but I mean, it's enough to have a bit of variety. I never feel I get my money's worth though cause I get full after 1 - 1 1/2 normal sized plates. (I don't have the biggest 

My dad likes their Mango Lassi. He says it's the best he's ever had at any restaurant (Other states and Canada).

OTHER NOTES:
- All the dishes I've ordered have been kind of oily.

- They have a large vegetarian section.

- Every time I've been here, this place has only been maybe 1/4 filled at the most.

- I'm black and a few times I've been stared at by Indian families while eating, which is uncomfortable and kind of disheartening, but it's alright. I'm not going to let it really bother me.

- Waiters/Waitresses/Hosts are very nice, informative if you have questions and seem to come at the perfect times to check on you."}
{"text":"I have a sneaking suspicion some (or most?) of their curries are somewhat pre-packaged. But as a non-Indian/Indian American (what do I know about \"authentic\" Indian food, really?) this place does the trick for my occasional cravings. A tad pricey but what can you do?  I've had the chicken curry mostly and its surprisingly yummy. The inside is a little gloomy for decor, which is one reason I always order take-out. But yeah, I guess I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I've only been here for the lunch buffet and I'm a fan!  I like coming for lunch because they always have popular dishes available.  I'm always pleased with their curries and sauces, but the naan is probably my least favorite of all the Indian restaurants I've visited.  Service is a little flaky and slow sometimes, but always friendly."}
{"text":"I was in town for a week for work. Went here for dinner with a few of my colleagues. We got assorted appetizers and they were really good. The papad was good too. The main course (curries) that we ordered, bhindi masala, paneer tikka masala & eggplant bharta, were good but a little bland. 

Would not mind going back again."}
{"text":"I am really sad to write this review as Bombay on Green St. was our go-to for Indian.

Get there yesterday for lunch - it was crowded I will give them that.  

Started out with them refusing to sell us a cup of milk for my son who doesn't like pop.   Um - there was milk right there in the cooler but the counter man said it's just for cooking.  How hard would it have been to pour a cup of milk for a kid and charge us whatever?

We sit and wait and wait and wait for our food.  A group who came in about 10-15 minutes after us got served before us.  Some poor girl at another table got served about 15 minutes after the rest of her group!  

My husband accidentally spills his water just as the waiter is walking by and he completely ignores our attempts to clean it up.  We finally get our  food but I have to get back to work and we dump everything into to go containers without eating a bit.  Again, a waiter walks by while we do this and says nothing.

My husband and son eat their food immediately after getting back to his office.  They are both almost instantly sick.  

No one working at the restaurant looked familiar.  I wonder if they are under new management?  As I sad - I'm sad to write this because we really loved Bombay on Campus."}
{"text":"This place makes no qualms about itself. It is a solid Punjabi joint, creamy curries, paneer and all.  That said, it's rather lacking in spicy inspiration - both locations didn't feature any sort of kick to their curries.  However, the lunch special is all bang for your buck...I recently went here on a lunch meeting and my professor and I were able to split one plate and leave completely stuffed!  I'm glad the only real traditional Punjabi Indian joint in C-U isn't a disaster, but it's nothing to write home about either!"}
{"text":"In the interest of full disclosure, Bombay Grill is decent Indian Food. What makes me indifferent is that I can have what they make for me at home, for a cheaper price and tastier result.  That said, this place beats the socks off it predecessor - the sorry excuse for an Indian restaurant Basmati.  However, the curries were insipid, the Samosa was all right, and the raita ran on the sour side.   I did appreciate the free rice with the curry though!  I'll be back when I'm too lazy to cook for myself, but maybe this time I'll ask for a higher spice level and see how they treat me."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! Chicken saga is tender and flavorful. Coworkers really like the jelfrese. Don't miss the cheese or garlic naan! YUM!"}
{"text":"Other than the taste of the food everything is HORRIBLE in Bombay Grill. There are couple waiters there who are extremely rude and racists. I will only write about my last experience there. In my last visit the waiter almost threw the menu on our table. He asked our orders in a very rude manner, grabbed our plates without asking us wether we have finished or not (and obviously we were not finished and there were plenty of foods still sitting in our plates). Maybe the rudest thing that he did was that after returning our checks, he stood in front of our table to get them back while we were writing him tips and signing the receipts. Other than that, we also ordered two appetizers which came after the main dishes! Also, one of our main dishes came substantially later than the other ones. The only good thing about the restaurant is that the food still tastes good. But a good restaurant is not only about the taste of the food. It is about having a good experience. 

 All in all, I can tell that this business cannot survive with its current horrible service and I will never ever go there unless things change there. There are other good places in the town to dine in."}
{"text":"When I was an undergrad at UofI from 2003-2007, I loved going to Bombay Grill.  I think they actually opened in 2005?  Not sure.  Regardless, my life hasn't been the same since I have eaten their food and also when I had to leave Chambana for St. Louis.  Every time I drive up to Chicago, I stop by Bombay Grill - the last several occasions they have been closed and I have resorted to eating at Za's.

Anyway, the chicken jalfrezi there is amazing.  I would gladly eat dog shit to be able to eat Bombay Grill once a week in St. Louis.  For all you lucky people still in Chambana, go and enjoy.  I-L-L- !!!"}
{"text":"I think the food is fantastic. And very consistent and great variety.

The thing that bugs me is the service. There are nearly a dozen men there who stand around and CONSTANTLY come by your table and ask you if everything's ok, if you want more water, etc. It gets old quick. I find it hard to have a conversation, as I just get constantly interrupted by one of these guys. There are just too many waiters here. And if the don't come by your table, they just stand and stare at you.

But I'm willing to put up with this because the food is so good."}
{"text":"At no other restaurant have I received service as excellent as I got here.  Your needs are attended to almost instantly, and the treatment is much better than most establishments at this price.  

I originally went here for my birthday, in large part because I was sick and Indian food was one of the few things with strong enough taste for me to enjoy.  I am glad I did.  While I can't remember the specific name of the dish I ordered, it involved Basmati rice, lamb, and cashew sauce.  It was excellent.  The provided chips (not sure of the specific name) were good, and free of charge, as was the pudding-esque small dessert.  In addition, the tea I got, which might have been called \"Masala Chai,\" was a good thing for sick me on that day.

Overall, one of the nicer restaurants in the area, and it cannot be beaten for Indian food out here."}
{"text":"Rock solid Indian food. Lunch menu is cheaper. Mango Lassi has about three different flavors based on what night you go and a lot of the chicken seems to be prepared beforehand. That being said its great. I love the food, not the lamb for some reason, but its hard to think of anything better for the price."}
{"text":"Bombay Grill is hands-down my favorite on-campus restaurant. I know that among my friends, I'm a lone voice in strong favor of them, but trust me, it's so good. 

They have excellent vegetarian options, the portions are substantial, and the owner is sociable. He demonstrated to me that he is serious about separating vegetarian from non-vegetarian food (at the very least, beef from non-beef): \"I'm Indian. And Hindu.\" And he had a religious tattoo to show that he meant it. I only asked because I've heard of some places using animal broth for vegetarian dishes. Anyway. 

The curry is always creamy and flavorful. This is the only thing I get so I can't speak for all the dishes (though my friend and I ate at the Bombay buffet on First St... and subsequently puked from superhumanly gorging ourselves on their divine food). 

So you're probably wondering, \"Jessica, if Bombay is so bitchin' why didn't you give this place 5 stars?\" Okay, truth time. I hope not to offend the manager but rather to have my vexation understood. I got a $9 chicken korma with no chicken. I substituted paneer.  When I became suspicious that I was shortchanged, I asked for a receipt, which I wasn't initially given. I suspected that my substitution was equivalent to something else on the menu that cost more. Turns out, I was almost right. The receipt indeed showed a higher price. But nothing like paneer korma was listed on the menu at the price shown-- there were no paneer extras nor paneer curry dishes at that price. So basically the manager kind of waved a hand and whipped up a price on the spot. I was purposely trying to stay under $10. But that's not my only source of frustration. It's just not knowing what you're getting and making prices willy nilly.

The food is truly delicious though. I will still probably come back. But I'll ask what it'll cost before making any substitutions."}
{"text":"Service was fast.  Prices are very reasonable.  The food is good by Champaign standards and OK by larger market standards.  I had the Chicken Vindaloo which had a nice flavor but was lacking in heat.  The naan was nice but just slightly burnt.  

I would go back if I was in champaign and jonesin for some indian food, but i wouldnt seek it out as a fantastic restaurant"}
{"text":"generally okay place, a little overpriced for the settings:(  noisy and place is too small, not looking very neat... food portion is below average. maybe not again."}
{"text":"I really, really adore this restaurant. We usually come here for buffet on Saturday afternoons but also occasionally for dinner. My favorites are the standards: chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, any makhani, biryani, etc. We have never had to wait for a seat for more than two minutes, no matter how busy the restaurant, and servers are incredibly attentive!

So why only four stars? This restaurant puts A LOT of salt in their food, and I happen to be very sensitive to sodium. Unfortunately, even after a half of a plate of food I need to go home and take a nap. For the buffet, this is not really economical. For dinner, it is not a problem because I can measure food pretty well so if you have any problems similar to my own I would recommend sticking with that.

Otherwise, I am very satisfied with all of my experiences at Bombay. Buying Basmati was probably the best decision they made, since the Bombay on campus is good (and cheaper), but parking is difficult to come by."}
{"text":"Great indian food; spiced well and not Americanized.. The naan is fresh and amazing."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey for what you get in my opinion but nonetheless the food is spot on. My fav thing to get here is the tikka masala chicken. The yogurt marinate makes the chicken incredibly tender and is complimented well with the tomato based sauce flavored with spices. The naan is really good too, served warm and soft. It also comes with different sauces to try - sweet and a spicier one I believe. My friend had the chicken saag, which has the tender yogurt marinated chicken, but served with a spinach based sauce. I've also had the samosas too but they weren't that great. I prefer the samosas at Mirsung grocery much more. Overall good food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant that I have been to so far! I went to Baadmash in LA and I personally think the curry was better here. I always order the Chicken Vindaloo and my boyfriend gets the Chicken Tikka. The Chicken Vindaloo is AMAZING you have to try it!! I personally don't like potatoes so I asked if I could get the dish without potatoes and the worker, possibly owner, kindly said that he would just add more chicken. I mean talk about hospitality! I love the workers and the care that they have for their customers. This is always my go to restaurant whenever I want to treat myself out!"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is usually great, the food is good, and like another reviewer said, a VAST improvement over the depressing Basmati restaraunt that used to be in the same space.

BUT. Oh my god, the service. We've made a game of how many different servers we'll get coming to take our order, or how often the water glasses get refilled (current record: 19 times in a single dinner). It's almost impossible to relax, eat, and talk with friends when every two minutes someone is reaching across you to take away your silverware, switch out one plate for another one, or top up your almost-full water glass. And when the servers aren't at your table, they just stand in a line at the back of the room, staring at you. It would be funny if it weren't so distracting!"}
{"text":"This would normally be given 4 stars with room for improvement, but since is the only place in CU to get Indian food, it gets 5 stars.  The food itself is pretty damn phenomenal.  I had Lamb Saag, which knocked my socks off.  I've had better Lamb Saag, but that was at Taste of the Himalayas in San Francisco, and I don't see myself getting back there anytime soon.  The lamb was tender (but not totally melty-tender as at Taste of the Himalayas), and the saag was creamy and flavorful (with a hint of lemon!).  My fiance had Chicken Tikka Masala, which was definitely the best I've ever tasted.  The side order of naan was plentiful--definitely enough for our party of four.  The rice was not plain, but decorated with little vegetables, and most importantly, was not sticky with starch.  I didn't try the dishes my mother and stepfather tried, but they were extremely happy with their choices.

My only problem was the service.  They were overly attentive in the kind-of-intrusive way.  We'd be talking and a waiter would come up and start talking over us immediately--that sort of thing.  And they were constantly there in some capacity, whether it be filling up 3/4-full water glasses or asking if we wanted more popodums or naan or if they could take our dishes yet.  Cool it, folks.  We're trying to have a leisurely dinner here.  I know there are worse things than being served attentively, which is the other reason Bombay retains its 5 star rating from me."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Champaign by a mile. The staff is very friendly and offers excellent service. I've been going here for almost two years and they're very consistent when it comes to the quality of food. The garlic naan is as good as you can get anywhere in the US and most of the entrees I've had here have the right balance of spices. Try their dal makhani, and thank me later."}
{"text":"It appears to have gone out of business as of February 10, 2014.  A large banner hanging in front of the restaurant says \"restaurant for lease\".  See the photo I posted."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times with my co-workers who LOVE Indian food.  The Lunch Buffeet is pricey 10.95 plus tax.  But it has a lot of options.  I love the Tikka Masala...though how it is prepared (mild to medium) depends on the day.  For a friend's birthday they will even prepare (cost/free?) a large plate of select traditional Indian desserts for you table - mango ice cream, etc."}
{"text":"Really great food. Best to come around lunch and get the Buffet so you can try new things. A little pricey but so worth it if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"Decent, but just much too expensive for the quality of the food and the presentation. Really need to reduce prices rather than raising them. Mashawi slanging 2.99 falafel sandwiches is going to put every other small business (except sakanaya) on green st out of business if people don't get serious with their pricing."}
{"text":"Ordered the a spicy chickpea/potato dish with a side of rice and a soda. Soda was completely flat and lukewarm served with a couple of ice cubes that looked like the server had scooped it out from the bottom depths of the freezer. Rice was stale, cold, and hard. Chickpeas and potatoes were incredibly hard and seem barelt cooked at all. Meal came out to nearly $20. Definitely not worth you money or time! Incredibly poor food quality. Doesn't seem like they put any effort into their food or service."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant with my family to celebrate an occasion but this place absolutely ruined our evening. The first thing we noticed upon entering the restaurant was that the guys working there were gossiping about the multicultural guests sitting in the restaurant. This is quite rude. The entire time we were there, the guy serving us showed a real bad attitude. He acted as if he was doing us a favor. In the end, the guy took plates in a terrible manner even without asking if we were done or if we needed boxes.

The food was OK nothing special and does not represent good Indian cooking. I could go back for the food, if they fire the existing staff with bad attitude or teach them some manners. If I were the owner, I would know who that waiter is."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant on Green street. My friends and I go here almost anytime we're on Green street. It's a nice family owned restaurant with very authentic Indian food! Chris, the chef/owner, greets us every time we come in and will make us delicious \"chef's special\" dishes. Just ask if you want an off the menu item! All of the employees are very hospitable and quick to accommodate the customers' diets (paleo, gluten free, etc.) Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This Indian restaurant surprised me in how good it was!  We had several dishes - a Tikka, a Masala, and a Mekhani and all were very flavorful and tasty.

The Naan was delicious and enormous!  We ordered 3 pieces for our party of 3 and only used two.  Whoops!

Service was fine - amusing giving my order at an Indian restaurant to a white teenager, though!"}
{"text":"It seems like the Bombay on Green Street and First Street are the same franchise but this Bombay on First Street seems cleaner and nicer than the other one on Green Street. The place seems very intimate and quiet -a nice place to take your hot date lol. Each table was set up nicely with utensils, folded tablecloth, plates, and water glasses. Also one of the staff would lit your table with tiny tea candles as you get adjusted. I think the nice staff and the environment made the food even more enjoyable. 

My boyfriend and I shared a Lamb Aloo Ginger Curry entree with butter na'an and samosa. The Lamb Aloo Ginger Curry had tender pieces of lamb and potatoes in some kind of ginger curry sauce. I really liked how the curry wasn't too hot but hot enough to enjoy the flavors. Also, I think Bombay makes the best naan in CU. You can't forgot about naan! I have a penchant for naan at Indian restaurants. Bombay's naan was so soft, fresh, and warm. A great addition to your meal.  

I also recommend people to try the Samosa. They are crispy crab ragoon-like shaped appetizer, stuffed with potatoes & green peas.I loved how everything came out fresh out of the kitchen, and our whole meal was perfect for two people. I think two curry entrees can be a little too much. The price was eh a little too much. I think the price at Indian restaurants can be a little too much, but this meal was too enjoyable to complain about the price of the meal. The staff was friendly and the food was great. I am a fan of Bombay Grill."}
{"text":"Great super casual and quick Indian, with a nice guy (the owner?) who works the counter.  I concur with most other reviews,  but need to add three things: 1) Their naan is enormous (like the biggest I have ever seen!) and delicious.  2) Their samosas are amazing. Always get them! Worth every calorie.  3) Their women's bathroom is kinda scary and gross (and why I am deducting an additional star). No hot water or paper towels,  dirty, and down a sketchy hallway.  Bombay folks, please fix this!

Definitely worth a stop for lunch, and I will be back,  but use the bathroom at home or office before."}
{"text":"I've been here for the buffet twice now and it is a perfectly decent buffet.  The buffet dishes are definitely as mild as Indian food can come, and next time I am going to ask for a little dish of chili oil or some other spice to punch it up.  That said, the naan is delicious and plentiful, the servers nice, and the buffet variety good (multiple chicken and vegetarian dishes both times, no lamb), so if you are in the mood for Indian buffet, this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is the best that C-U can do for Indo-Pak cuisine? (Asking around yields responses indicating the other local options aren't much better.) It seems perfectly decent for Westerners who want something different and an idea of what Indian cuisine is like. But any mediocre Devon Avenue curry shack can run rings around this place, primarily because they can't get away with trying to pass off stuff like this to a bunch of suburban white kids as authentic. Think of this place as the La Bamba of Desi cuisine.

What's more, those Devon Avenue joints charge about 1/3rd less, despite operating in a much more expensive market. Let's be clear, this place is MASSIVELY overpriced (one reason for a two-star rating rather than three), more in line with a comfortable, well-decorated and maintained family sit-down restaurant rather than the dog-eared curry shack that it actually is. Which reminds me, DO NOT be fooled by the interior restaurant image on their website -- it's sheer, utter bullshit verging on deceptive advertising. That's the other reason for a two- rather than three-star rating. If the place actually looked like that then the prices would be understandable.

Students from South Asia must be out of their minds trying to find decent familiar cuisine around here."}
{"text":"Mediocre Indian food. I eat Indian food in almost every town I go to and even had it catered at my wedding so I would consider myself somewhat of an Indian food connoisseur. Having said that, there's not much selection in this town.

Samosas chat were flavorful. Our entrees were just okay. I ordered lamb korma which baaarely had a korma taste. To be honest, I forgot that that was the dish I was eating. The curry was very thin. I don't remember what my husband ordered but its flavor was very heavy on the tomato. Like a tomato soup almost. The lamb itself was delicious, but the overall dish was borderline disappointing. They didn't offer spice levels on the food. It wasn't bland per se, but it was more like amateur night than the real deal. The best part of the meal was the appetizer and the naan. It was reasonably priced though.

It was also super noisy. Don't know if I'll go back, but I had to try it for myself to see if it was any good."}
{"text":"This was by far my favorite restaurant in Champaign when I lived there. Bobby who works there is awesome, and the kofta is so delicious. I miss this place."}
{"text":"Delicious curry, their Nan is also amazing. They have several kinds of Nan, try the garlic or cheese stuffed!"}
{"text":"So good!  Solid Indian food!  Lunchtime special cannot be beat!  Note - it gets busy so be prepared to have to wait if busy meal time.

If you are concerned about spice tell them and they will show you the options for non-spicy dishes."}
{"text":"For the lunch buffet: I havent had a whole lot of Indian food, so I really cant speak to how this compares to other places, but as an newbie to the cuisine, I thought it was very good and worth the money. I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I am so suprised with the ratings. I have had good Indian food and this was mediocre. The chicken tika Masala was bland and the rice was hard.  

The worst part is the staff. They are rude and have horrible attitudes. Every time I came, I left feeling like I was disrespected. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good, not great. The portion size was a bit too small for the price. Ive had frozen Indian food that is comparable to what I had at Bombay. I mean, the experience was enjoyable (minus the cramped table) but I really don't think it's all that great."}
{"text":"This place has a great variety of food! Go here for lunch! The portion is bigger and it's cheaper. You get a salad and a small appetizer with your entree during lunch, but you have to pay for it during dinner. The naan here is absolutely to die for. the only complaint i have about this restaurant is that you will walk out of there smelling like the food. The odor is not the most pleasant so I wouldn't suggest wearing your sunday best."}
{"text":"Food was pretty average.  Waitress was pleasant.  I ordered the mixed grill.  It was all chicken.  Where was the mix that was on the menu?!?  $15.99 for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain.  No rice. Burnt naan.  I will return to Puran in Bloomington:)"}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty good and affordable.  It beats the other Indian joint in town.  The only drawback is that it's not very clean (flies may be buzzing around as you eat) and it's very hot in the summer (their air conditioning sucks).  So I would not recommend going there on a hot humid day.  I would also not recommend going there with a large group.. as other reviews have suggested, the place is not big.  Waiter service ONLY at night.

Anyhoo... there are many choices you can make but not all are good.  I like the chicken mekhani (aka butter chicken) or lamb biryani (aka lamb and fried rice.. but it's delish).  If you are accustomed to Indian food or want to be more adventurous then I would suggest the saag paneer (spinach and cheese), spinach and chicken dish, eggplant dish (I believe it's called bengan bartha), or gobi aloo (cauliflower and potatoes).  I'm not a fan of the tandoori chicken.

Oh they also have this naan (which is like pita bread) with lamb in it.  I forgot what it's called but I've tasted it and it's pretty good.

Well worth a visit if you want to try something different."}
{"text":"Experienced Bombay Indian Grill for the first time this evening for dinner! 

Things to note:
*Service was prompt! 
*The portion sizes were generous, especially the naan!
*Prices were very reasonable. 

I ordered Chicken Curry, Plain Lassi, Raita, and Naan. The Lassi was a bit too thick, but still very enjoyable in the sweltering weather of Champaign.

The Naan was humongous, well-buttered, fresh, and delicious! Chicken Curry was excellent too! 

Overall, a great first visit! Look forward to many more!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was good, fine, but I wasn't particularly impressed.  Ordered vegetable vindaloo.  The place lacks any ambiance, though it does have a nice view of Green Street.  The naan is very good."}
{"text":"Given the growing popularity of Indian cuisine, I am surprised that the Bombay Grill conglomerate (Green Street location, First Street location, Bombay Bazaar) have such a monopoly on Indian food in this town.  The other student-accessible restaurants (Zyggyz's and Mirsung) are good options for a casual lunch, but this Bombay Grill is the only viable option for a \"nice\" dinner.

If you want to try Bombay Grill, lunch time is the best time.  They serve a fully-loaded buffet that features both a cold bar and hot bar.  Almost nobody touches the cold bar.  What's the deal, people?  The raita and chutneys are some of the best things here.  Along with several hot dishes (curries, stir-fry, tandoori chicken), they serve a soup, dessert(s), and cumin chips each day.  Most dishes are above average, but the curry sometimes tastes watered-down.  The price of the buffet kind of makes me balk ($13), so I usually fast for a day before gorging myself (sorry, that probably sounds unnecessarily gross).

I try to avoid this place at dinner.  The quality of food is certainly better than what is available on the lunch buffet, but I also have to break the bank to pay for it.  If you want to sample a broad range of food at dinner, I would suggest going with friends who will split dishes.  The best dinner deal is probably the biryani (Indian-style fried rice), which is served with raita.  It comes in a huge serving for a reasonable price ($12-$14).

I can't complain about the service.  The wait staff is always awesome at refilling drinks and clearing plates without interrupting your mealtime conversations.  I've also often come with large groups, and they've been perfectly hospitable when accommodating us."}
{"text":"This is a great place to start if you want to try Indian food and have never had it before. My fiance' and I were on a date night with no kids and we wanted to try something different. We decided to give this a shot. It was delicious! We plan on going again!"}
{"text":"Indian food has been my kryptonite as of late.

There were 4 people inside the place at 6 on a Friday, which seemed odd.

I ordered chicken tikka masala and naan to go, waited about 10 minutes for it, and was on my way. 

Friendly folks at the counter.

The food was good! Great flavor on the masala, just the right amount of spicy, tender chunks of chicken. The naan was gigantic, warm, and quite tasty.

Like the other reviews, it seems that overall Bombay is a little overpriced. My order was nearly $15, granted that made 2 large meals for me, but for ~$9 I could have gotten as much (or as little) of a variety of Indian food at Ambar's buffet, which is comparable in taste and quality, I'd say.

Either way, it was tasty, I was full, and my Indian food craving was very much satisfied."}
{"text":"Totally solid, no-frills Indian food.  The lunch specials are affordable and come with rice/naan (THE LARGEST PIECE OF NAAN YOU'VE EVER SEEN), salad, and a veggie pakora - for under $10.  Yes, please!

I've only been to the 1st Street location once, but from what I've tasted, the food is basically the same here.  Creamy chicken tikka masala (my fave, I'm a gringo, I know) with crispy, buttery naan, mmm.  I tried my boyfriend's Lamb Saag dish and loved it also.

Why is the lunch so affordable?  Because it's a really small place (the tables are tightly-packed in), there's no waiter service, and your meal is served on Styrofoam.  This is Indian food for poor college students.  If you want a more relaxed, \"restaurant-y\" atmosphere (and don't mind paying a few extra dollars), head over to the Bombay Grill on 1st.  But if, like me, you are in grad school and up to your ass in student loan debt, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"They handle large groups well. We had about 20 and it went off without a hitch: checks were separated with ease, orders were correct, and service (on a non-busy night) was perfect.

One thing to avoid: \"Taj Mahal\" brand beer.  \"Brewed for Connoisseurs\" my ass. Per born-on date, it was brewed 8 months ago. It was apparently then shipped on the poop deck of a shit raft from the smelly part of India to the smelly part of the US and along the way exposed to the sun as much as possible. What I am trying to say is that it was as skunky of a beer as I have tasted since high school."}
{"text":"Ordered pickup online & when I got back to the hotel I realized there were no utensils or any containers to eat out of. Had to get plates & utensils from the hotel. Then we tasted our food which we clearly ordered as MILD but it was extremely Hot/Spicy. We couldn't eat the sauce at all."}
{"text":"We love Bombay on Green St! Really delicious Indian food, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food and this place knows how to do it right. My boyfriend goes here once a week and they know him by name, that's dedication. 

You can range on how spicy you want it and I love spicy, but after one pepper it's almost a wrap for me.

It's a small restaurant, I've never dined it and we've always ordered out. It's authentic and delicious, definitely a must if you're in Champaign, IL."}
{"text":"Food is delicious.  Hands down, it's fantastic and based on food alone I would have given this place a 4.

The reason it's a three though is that the service tends to be lackluster with the servers not really offering recommendations (which can be a problem if you're not that familiar with Indian food) and honestly... no matter when I've been in there the place has been virtually empty.  I'm not entirely sure I know they stay in business.  The ambiance is definitely lacking enough that I take down a star."}
{"text":"I ordered my food online with my credit card at about 6:30 PM. 

At 8PM, I called Bombay Indian Grill, and asked about the status of my food. I was told that the delivery guy should be picking up soon.

Around 9PM, I called again. This time I was told I had to call delivery.com. I tried calling, and no one picks up. 

Around 9:30PM, I get a call from the delivery person. When I go to take my food, he says, \"you're supposed to pay with cash.\" I explained that I already paid via yelp's link for online delivery with my credit card. He said, \"it says you are paying with cash.\" I proceed to stand there for fifteen minutes, while he calls various people to finally get to the number to call to confirm my method of payment. He says, \"do you have your credit card?\" I respond, \"no.\" He says, \"you'll need it because they're going to want to confirm the payment.\" Mind you, I am in the law building. My stuff is on the other side of the law building. I am not wandering around looking for my credit card, while he calls people to confirm my payment. I just stood there. At one point, I said, just void this I don't want it. Then my hunger snapped me back to my senses. 

After some time on the phone, he is told I paid with my credit card already. I told him I would not be using their services again, he said \"okay.\" He walked out unaffected. 

Around 10 PM, I called the number on delivery.com, and heard no apologies. 

Thanks Bombay Grill, for providing me with the distinct pleasure of paying $23 to have cold mutter paneer and wilted garlic naan delivered to me more than 2.5 hours after I ordered it. The lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch.

Thanks delivery.com, for demonstrating that incompetence and a lack of care is possible at all levels of an organization."}
{"text":"I was a little reluctant to try this place out but after getting a thumbs up from my Indian friend, I finally gave in. It is quite a small place with 20 or less small tables. I was there with 5 other friends and found that it is particularly hard to find a table that was big enough to accommodate all of us, especially during lunch time.

I was surprised when I tasted their food because I thought it was gonna be really bad. It turned out to be okay although it wasn't excellent. I love their paneer makhani because the sauce was wonderfully creamy but oddly, the paneer tasted like tofu to me. I also had their lentil curry and briyani rice but that weren't as good. You have a choice of a huge naan or rice for lunch specials I think. I'd go for the NAAN if I were you.

Expect to spend at least $7 or $8 for vegetarian dishes and more for meats. For the amount of food that they give, the prices are a little steep in my opinion. It's usually the naan that fills me up, not the curry.

Updated 5/10/08:
I was there for dinner and I realized that it was a completely different experience in the evening. For lunch, you order your food and pay at the cash register. When the food is ready, they will serve it to you in styrofoam plates and plastic cutleries. For dinner, it becomes a sit-down restaurant with table service, cute waitresses, and food served on china and silverware. A stark difference, eh?"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Prior to trying out Bombay Indian Grill, I had only tried Indian food once and I absolutely despised it. But when I came down to Champaign I knew I had to give it a second shot and Bombay Indian Grill was the place that stole my heart. Their samosas are crispy and cooked to perfection, their buttery naan is amazing, and their Chicken Makhani was so so good. I wish it was a more spicier dish but it was still delicious with tons of flavor. The waiters are always attentive and friendly - if not too friendly. This place gets busy quickly so go earlier or later than a usual meal time but beware of the 3-5 closing time because I had gone between those times not knowing they closed and I was really disappointed. Learn from my mistake!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Champaign ....

From chats to curries, I love it all. My favorites were papdi chat, samosa chat ... but I have tried all appetizers. Chicken saag is just out of world, I love the creamy texture, freshness it has, I have had it in many places, but this place does the best. I miss this place truly."}
{"text":"I had the dinner at this place few months back and it was disappointing. I had veg assorted appetizer, chicken tikka masala and naan. Veg appetizer was ok, rest was not good. After that experience, I gave up on finding a good Indian restaurant in Champaign. 
But few days ago, it was raining heavily In Champaign and like any Indian, I started craving for hot pakoras(fritters) and samosa. I thought of taking a chance and asked my husband to get a take out of vegetable pakoras and samosa from this place. I prepared tea at home and started dreaming of enjoying hot appetizers with my ginger tea. As soon as my hubby came, I snatched the bag away from him and put everything on the plate, poured the tea, switched on the movie for a perfect evening. As soon as I picked the pakora, my fingers got coated with a layer of oil. They were so oily and soggy. And they should stop calling it vegetable pakoras, as out of 7-8 pakoras 6 were of potato and rest of cauliflower. Call them potato pakora. I was hoping samosa will save the day but Hell No :(.. The filling was bland, the pastry was neither crispy nor flaky. The only thing tasting good was tea, which was made by me.
That's it, no more trying Indian restaurants in Champaign."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken curry, the meat was spoiled and made me throw out. Will not come here ever again."}
{"text":"Good portion sizes... but there's really no spice at all... the curry dishes taste like creamy flavorlessness. It's also almost a guarantee that if you order it delivery, it will get to you cold, making it even worse. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
Hmm Indian food selection is very limited in Champaign so I was excited to eat at Bombay again since my medical school days. I had only been here once with my wife for dinner and the food was pretty spicy. The lunch special seemed enticing for 7+ dollars depending on what you order. I wish I took a picture of the menu, maybe next time. The chicken curry I ordered took a bit of time to prepare but it came out piping hot. The curry was not spicy at all which was perfect. It was rich and creamy with ample amount of chicken. The naan was simply the largest naan I have ever seen. It was perfect with the curry. You also get a potato pakora. No salad though as mentioned previously. All and all great, but if you could pay a dollar or two more for buffet at someplace else I probably would go with that for variety. The only downside of this place is that they use plastic ware and plates, but I guess this is a college town after all and I have to lower my standards. 

Pro: large menu with lunch specials, large naan, not too spicy curry

Cons: plasticware, slow service

Hidden gem: 
7+ dollar lunch specials with large naan or rice and potato pakora"}
{"text":"We were on the campus for an event on Saturday and decided to try out this place. The food was awesome, prepared hot. I tried Chicken garlic masala and my wife tried Chicken curry and both were great tasting.

Will certainly visit this place next time on the campus."}
{"text":"I absolutely think that Bombay Grill has the best chicken mahkani.  No restaurants in Chicago (even on Devon) can compare!  Or maybe I just haven't found that one perfect place in the city yet...

So anyways, when I was an undergrad, I luckily lived across the street from Bombay so I would come here all the time.  The manager knew me by my first name, hahahahha that was embarassing.  

Yes their prices can be a little expensive but I think it's worth it.  I love their garlic naan too.  What I hate about all indian restaurants is that everything is always separate--- naan, rice, etc.  Blah.

Anyways, A+ for Bombay!"}
{"text":"This place had THE best chicken tikka masala I've ever eaten in Champaign-Urbana!

My boyfriend suggested that we go there and I have to say I'm bummed that I've lived in Champaign for so long without knowing this place existed! I really love the crispy bread they bring out with the two different dipping sauces. It's light and flaky but still somehow has a lot of flavor. I also had enough to take home for lunch the next day, it was all soooo good! Not to mention, while the atmosphere wasn't the classiest, it was still really nice and romantic and the staff was fast and polite. I definitely want to come back and try to venture away from my usual Tikka Masala, even though it's my favorite!"}
