{"text":"The waffle was thick but not crispy - I wish I asked him to leave it on there for another minute. There are other flavours (cinnamon, maple, strawberry) but I don't see myself returning anytime soon...especially since Marbleslab's dark chocolate ice cream is just across the street."}
{"text":"Was craving a Belgian waffle after having an amazing waffle down in NYC. After a quick Google search this place came up and my girlfriend and I decided to check it out. She ordered the strawberry delight waffle and I ordered a breakfast crepe. The waffle was tiny and my crepe wasn't up to par with what I was expecting. The waffle was good but it wasn't great...the dough didn't taste fresh. My girlfriend ordered a hot chocolate which was actually very tasty. The service was also very slow, we were surprised to see only 1 employee working on a Sunday. Will probably search for another waffle place the next time we are craving Belgian waffles."}
{"text":"I would give it no star if I could. Whoever hire those two mainlanders need to teach them english and how to calculate properly not rounding up tax and everything. They didn't even understand us after we pointed out that $2.99 plus tax isn't $3.50 and they can't just round everything up. It's not a chinese market for god's sake.
 Apparently the total came to $12 according to them. Which in truth(they handed us a calculator and we actually rounded 2.99 to 3) the total only came to $11.25. I know its few cents different but I didn't really care about that. But the fact that they figured we wouldnt know anyways so they cheated. Then they acted like they were doing us a favor by saying its okay it's okay few cents. Well you know what, if it is in your country then get the hell back there.

Please make sure your employees understand the fact that it's not okay to do so. We tried to explain but they didn't look like they get it. They seem as if it's normal and they did nothing wrong. I wonder how many customers had been cheated on already."}
{"text":"These waffles were small and dense, not what I was expecting. We ordered the maple syrup variety and got only a suggestion of syrup and canned whipped cream. The service was friendly but wasn't impressed by the food."}
{"text":"Crepe was ok, the bubble tea was the worst!!!!! The service was not good either, very slow and not professional at all. Don't think I will go back! Very disappointed !"}
{"text":"Love the way it is hot toasty, smells like heaven and has bite. The original is good but the ice cream and caramel sauce doesn't hurt.

I wish they upped a notch on their decor and served it on plates rather then plastic containers and cutlery."}
{"text":"This waffle is the bomb. I went to Belgium looking for some proper waffle or crepes in Brussels and Bruges yet the best waffle and crepes I had was here at home in Toronto, wtf? Wanda's Belgian waffles is the bomb, it's heavenly indeed."}
{"text":"First let me say that my usual dessert place is Caffee Demetre and since the Yorkdale location closed I was looking for something similar but closer.

After finding Wanda's I was pumped to try it after reading reviews and looking at the pictures. 

Came here with the GF last night and a few tables were taken and looked like a line was starting outside...A busy place is always a good sign.

We both ordered the waffle with ice cream and fruit and I opted for a milkshake instead of water. In hindsight I should have just ordered water because the consistency and taste of the milkshake was almost the same. I knew something was not quite right when the server dropped it off and it had bubbles on the top. 

While they do give a generous serving of fruit they skimp on the ice cream...it seemed like one small scoop. The waffle itself was not small but was smaller than Demetre's and was harder and more dense, almost like it was not cooked completely. 

One of the servers looked like he didn't even want to be there much less serve you. When I asked for my milkshake after my initial order it looked like I was giving him the worst trouble in the world.

For the price you pay you would expect proper plates and cutlery but I guess it worked out because I had to fold the plate to throw out what my GF didn't want to finish, which was more than half.

Overall I would not return and will drive out a bit further to get to the other Demetre locations."}
{"text":"Smelling the waffle aroma off the street lured me in... with my kids. Very disappointed and overpriced. The waffle we're hard, I was expecting chewy on the inside with a slight crisp on the outside. We ordered one serving of plain crepes with maple syrup, and 2 servings of waffles with banana and whip cream. Drinks, water and a latte. My order was over 30$ - not worth it."}
{"text":"Oh Wanda's, love at first bite! 
I've been going to this place for years and haven't looked back since I first smelled that wonderful aroma and let curiosity get the best of me. I get the waffle and ice cream with caramel and each time it makes me fuzzy inside. The flavor of the waffle is what keeps bringing me back. Its so tasty, even just on its own. It melts in your mouth. I definitely recommend this place. I bring all my friends and they love it. Although, after years of waffles, I think I might finally try the crepes next time."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I've never had real Belgian waffles before but this place blew me away.  We tried a Liege Waffle (carmelized on one side) and a chocolate dipped Brussels waffle (a little heavier).  I preferred the Liege.  Both were pretty dense (these are not Eggo frozen waffles).  I took another one with me to go for our flight back.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday and tried their waffle and coffee special.  Can't complain about the Illy Coffee, but the waffle was terrible. It was not well baked. I think Eggo taste much better. The staff was very friendly but i guess she was overwhelmed to handle all the order by herself."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat sweets and I loved this place. The waffles were crispy dense and cakey, like what I remember from Brussels. Much better than the fluffy tasteless soggy waffles you usually find on this side of the pond!"}
{"text":"The delicious aroma was deceiving. Or maybe it's because I opted for the plain waffle.

After almost burning myself with it out of my own negligence (it comes out steaming from the waffle iron), I escorted my waffle down to Yonge-Dundas Square and found a seat to enjoy it.

I was disappointed to find it was heavy and doughy and had only tiny wisps of icing sugar on top. Certainly not the light treat I was expecting.

I will gladly return to my obsession with cupcakes instead.

$2.61 for a plain waffle, including taxes."}
{"text":"Tried Wanda's Belgian Waffles for the first time tonight (after all these years). I had the strawberry/banana waffle with chocolate. It was pretty tasty but I think if I go again I'll just get banana and chocolate and they are the better combination. 

The price was pricy. $7.99 for a small waffle and strawberry and banana, but I did get a lot of it. 

The restaurant itself was extremely warm... We're having a cold spring and yet inside I felt like I was dying with the heat. Otherwise fairly clean. 

Used the bathroom and it was clean and pleasant. Better than what you'd expect for downtown [Toronto]."}
{"text":"I got the banana crepe with chocolate sauce and it was TO DIE FORThere were lots of sweet desserts as well as some savoury stuff as well. The staff was very polite and helpful. I would definitely come here again and i would give it six stars is i could!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great crepes!  Love these guys will go again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Worst location to go to. You're better off going to the original one near the eaton centre.

I came in on a Saturday night (Nov 14th), and two young people were working (skinny guy and girl both with dark hair). I ordered 3 waffles to go (2 Belgian chocolate & 1 Nutella) and my total came up to 27 dollars and some cents. I honestly don't know how it cost that much when the menu says $5.99 for chocolate and $6.99 for Nutella. That comes to $18.97 without tax! 

I pointed it out and was ignored.. On top of that I waited 20 minutes for my waffles, even though the store was clearly not that busy. 

I've read some complaints on Google reviews about the Asian lady who works here but at least she doesn't rip me off like crazy!"}
{"text":"I couldn't resist the scent of vanilla waffles when i walked down Yonge street.... when I stepped in... I had to order one of those... and It was reasonably good (cant be compared to the waffles they have at the Rich Tree downtown)... they also serve Illy coffee which is wonderful. The service was good and friendly...  

you can give it a try if you are in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"AMAZING CREPES made fresh for abouuut 10 bucks"}
{"text":"The waffles are delicious and filling. The price was a bit more than I wanted to pay, but the nice thing is that it didn't feel like a \"cheap\" meal. Some places might give you less fruit or use less of a topping, but Wanda's doesn't. There were so many strawberries that I could barely finish them! The waffles tasted great too."}
{"text":"I love waffles and read that this place is pretty good. I ordered a Belgian chocolate waffle and added chocolate ice cream. It was bigger than I am accustomed to but it was cooked just right. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been to Wanda's at this location several times in the last few years. This is the place to go for a reasonably priced belgian waffle ($3.50 for a waffle, extra for add-ons - which is where it can get expensive). The waffles are cooked fresh to order. The chocolate dipped waffle is a must for me, the chocolate fudge sauce is incredible (and I am considered a chocolate snob by my friends). The mixed fruit or strawberry add on is usually good value, I've always received about a punnet of berries on the side (for about $3.50).

I had stopped going there for a while, after several times where the same server was never able to get the order right, and I was always charged a different price for exactly the same order. On my most recent visit the servers had changed, and the service had improved a lot. It's still a very casual place, the guy behind the counter called to us to confirm our order several minutes after we had paid and seen the check-out girl write the order down.

My main peeve is that when eating in, food is still served in plastic containers. Crepes appeared to be served on paper plates, and I don't see a reason why waffles can't be served this way too, in the very least.

This place really hits a sweet spot if you don't care too much about restaurant service, it does feel more like a cafeteria, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered a crepe and it was pretty good. Overall though, the experience was just average. The space is cramped; they have 3 or 4 small tables, so you couldn't bring a big group here. Service was slooow. My friend nearly finished eating her waffle before mine was served and we ordered at the same time. As well, I found it hard to eat my crepe with plastic utensils and a paper plate."}
{"text":"Very disapointing. The sweet smell of chocolate drags you in but that's almost all it has to offer unfortunately. They serve you in take out boxes even if you are dining in which makes it tricky to cut your crepe in a take out box. 

The crepe itself is nicely made but there is hardly any ice cream inside - hardly.

The service is poor. They passed our order around to 3 tables - people were about to eat it 3 times before they brought it to our table and got it right. And for those reasons i won't be returning there."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious waffles.  Nice batter,  just sweet enough.  Was super crisp on the outside with a nice softness on the inside.  From reading other reviews it appears that the waffle taste will depend on who makes it,  as I'm not sure how a waffle can taste stale when it's made in front of you.  I'm sure some waffle makers probably under or over cook them. 

Was first in line so I didn't have to wait long.  Although I can imagine it would take a while of you're not first since there appeared to be only one waffle iron.

Also it appears that waffles are ordered at the front and crepes at the back (inside)"}
{"text":"The crepe seemed to have been average compared to other places we've been even though we had heard alot about this place being good. I guess maybe they are better at waffle's as it seems to be in their name. Crepe was average....Quick and good service though."}
{"text":"GOD AWFUL WAFFLE 

The waffles are absolutely awful. It's undercooked, doughy, grainy, and all around NOT what I want in a waffle. The ice cream on top was fine. I payed $6.72 + Tip for waffles on ice cream with maple syrup. Way overpriced as it was served on a paper plate with plastic utensils. The seating area is next to non-existent. I couldn't even get through half a waffle - that's how god awful it was. Maybe get the crepe?"}

Extra information:

*Specialize in Waffles and Crepes
*Can get it to go or Dine in

Wanda's Waffles is everywhere, if for some reason you can't see it? you will def smell it. I was excited to see these everywhere when I first arrived in Toronto because I am a sucker for fresh waffles with icecream.

After lunch at Salad King, I decided to head to Wanda's for some dessert since I was already in the area. When I first walked in, I found the store to be very cluttered with things going on everywhere.

There weren't much interior going on, plus I could see flies everywhere (figures when they serve so much sweet stuff and the smell doesn't help either). The cashier was very friendly and she patiently waited as my sister and I were trying to figure out the menu deciding on what to order. They make waffles and crepes the moment you order them so it will take some time but at least you know they are fresh.

Ordered: ICE CREAM CREPE 2.5/5
*Crepe with chocolate inside and served with Vanilla icecream for $6.49
*Crepe was a little too doughey but it was ok with the icecream
*Good crepe should be light and chewy, this was too heavy and felt like thin pancakes
*Nothing special

Ordered: ORIGINAL WAFFLES W/ STRAWBERRIES
*Waffles with icecream for $6.49
*Waffle was again, very doughy, rich and heavy
*Texture of the waffle was almost like pound cake with lots of butter and cream
*Served with caramel, lots and lots of whipped cream and strawberries
*So many good things going on, waffles, whipped cream, chocolate and ice cream...but it just isn't good.
*Felt like i was eating a giant sweet dough with whipped cream and vanilla icecream

To be honest, I was actually warned by fellow food bloggers about this place how their waffles are a little too rich and heavy. I took note of it, but still wanted to try it anyways. Well, they were right, basically, afterwards I felt sick as if I drank a bottle of liquid syrup and a ball of dough....and that's not a good thing :(

Summary: Despite the sweet scent that drew me to this place, I was disappointed with the quality of waffles/crepes served and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I always get late-night cravings for this place! Every location I have tried has had great staff, and consistently good waffles and crepes. Some locations do not have the crepe sandwiches, which are my favourite, so go to the Yonge/Wellesley location for a meal as opposed to dessert. Very good, though, and amazing waffles!"}
{"text":"On the prowl for dessert we headed for this little dessert cafe.

I ordered a waffle with half icing sugar and half chocolate along with a coffee.

At least the coffee was good.
And so was the chocolate.
As for the waffle... it was still...waffle-esque.
It was still..the shape of a waffle...
Smelled like a waffle...
Crispy on the outside...
Hot...
...But different that what I would expect of a waffle... it was very dense...heavy...
The complete opposite of light and fluffy.
And I don't like the plastic takeout container it comes in.

Anyways, if you want delicious smelling hot dough in a clear plastic box, this is the place!"}
{"text":"sooo good! The original belgian waffle is more than enough for me... but when i'm feeling a little self-indulgent then I go for the works... fruits and ice cream!  The staff is very friendly. :)  Dinning area is a little small for groups."}
{"text":"After walking around Yonge street in the cold at night, belgian waffles were great to eat. Around 10 CAN you can get a belgian waffle with fruit and chocolate. When you sink your teeth into that waffle, its heavenly.The warmth, taste, and different textures make walking around not so bad.

But, being from the U.S. I didn't realize how expensive it was. I spent $30 USD for 3 of them."}
{"text":"Best waffles Eva! I love how they are chalky. Would love to know if these are just the normal Belgian waffle recipe."}
{"text":"The waffles are okay. I prefer mine to be crispy, but these are more \"bready\".
They're still tasty though. 

Service was great and quick, and the server even asked me how far I was going to see if she should put the whipped cream on the side or not.

The decor is a a bit cheesy.

Overall though, it's decent, but I've definitely had better waffles."}
{"text":"The delicious aroma of Wanda's lures you in.  I don't know what Wanda's official hours are, but we happened to be passing by one late night and there were 2 lonely waffles left - the perfect late-night snack!  We even got a deal because they were the last ones!

I love the portion size, the perfect crispiness and the variety of toppings they offer.  I chose the simple powdered sugar so that I could easily walk with my waffle.  If you're looking for a quick, affordable, portable, delicious dessert, Wanda's offers just that."}
{"text":"Frustrating that they wouldn't accept visa for under $20. I believe this is not legal but will be following up with visa. Otherwise, good experience. The server on  a sat afternoon was particularly friendly and helpful. My daughter spilled water on her jacket and the server helped clean it. The waffles were tasty but I was irked by the visa thing."}
{"text":"Yummy belgian waffles and crepes for affordable prices!"}
{"text":"no expert in waffles but tried the waffle with belgian chocolate dip and was quite satisfied with it. The service crew were making mistakes with our orders left and right but because it was practically empty, we
didn't mind too much.

The little add ons like ice cream or whipped cream make them slightly more expensive than what I'd really care to shell out but the waffle itself, was crisp on the outside with a chewy inside. It was ok."}
{"text":"It's a hole in the wall place, but it's hard to miss it since the sweet smell gets you to look over. The overweight guy working behind the counter, which had about as much moving space as a twin size bed, was really nice. Sadly, this place charges for every little addition of anything you want as an add on and that also includes any other flavor of regular ice cream that's not Vanilla. I'd understand if it were Cookies and Cream, Rocky Road or any other specialty flavor, but even Chocolate is extra. 

There was a special going on for Waffles and Ice Cream for $3.99. I was fortunate enough to have the guy making the waffles know what he was doing since the Waffle came out crispy in all the right places. While it was sweet it definitely hit the sweet tooth craving. The Waffle was assembled with Vanilla Ice Cream, Fudge Syrup and Powdered Sugar.

Pros
- Food is prepared in front of you 
- You know what you're getting. There's no hidden surprise.

Cons
- Overpriced: Any add on or substitution comes with a price tag.
- NO SEATING!! Seating is shared with the ice cream shop upstairs"}
{"text":"Mediocre \"waffles.\" It's getting worse as the years go by."}
{"text":"Pretty abysmal. Plastic to-go containers even when you tell them it's for here. Waffle is brittle on the outside, mushy on the inside. Whipped cream is bland. Wouldn't recommend to impress anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped by there on a Friday summer evening wanting a vanilla milkshake.  The bin with tubs of ice cream looked very inviting.  I ordered the shake and the server sold me a cup of flavored milk.  The confection had maybe a tablespoon of ice cream in it.  Cost 3.50. A lot of money for a frothy glass of milk.

Definitely will never come back.  No need to really.  A milkshake is pretty difficult thing to mess up."}
{"text":"I frequent the Yonge & Dundas area quite a bit and whenever I'm there I get this massive woft of waffle goodness up my nose. So with a few friends I decided to follow the sugary scent to 331 Yonge Street. Wanda's storefront is a tiny space which could house maybe 3 patrons standing, truly designed for high turnover.  

The waffles are very rich and hold a great texture. You can order your waffle plain, with powdered sugar, with maple or chocolate sauce, with ice cream, with fruits, or all of the above. I decided to just about do all of the above. 
I ordered a waffle with maple sauce, ice cream and strawberries. Aside from strawberries they have blackberries, raspberries, bananas and probably a couple other fruit toppings. I must say the waffle definitely hit the spot, it was made ready to order and the ice scream scoop and amount of strawberries was more that I thought I'd get, but then again it did cost about $8 everything in. 

I've had waffles in Belgium and I must say that this experience did not quite match up to my experiences over in Brussels, but at the same time it was not all that bad either. My mates and I rather enjoyed this rich treat whilst swing dancing at a Luminato special at Dundas Square. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to satisfy a raging sweet tooth, or anyone who is dying to know where that intoxicatingly sweet waffle smell is coming from. 

Goed Eten in Kensington is my next waffle stop, apparently they pwn waffles."}
{"text":"I love liege waffles, so I was eager to try out Wanda's waffles.

I went on a Friday evening, and there were 2 employees and about 10 people in line. At first I thought it was a good sign (as in, the waffles were good enough to warrant the wait). 

It turns out the wait was so long because the employees kept making mistakes on their orders. Customers were getting frustrated, and employees kept double-checking  orders.... and this continued for about 20 minutes.

After the long wait, I got a waffle in a cheap plastic container with a few strawberries and some whipped cream. It was $8. The waffle wasn't even warm. 

I don't think I'll be returning to this place, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went late Friday night after an otherwise uneventful night in. My partner had the pure maple syrup crepe and I went for the Nutella waffle, we added ice cream to both.

The person serving us asked where we wanted to sit and when we mentioned outside he said \"go ahead and grab a seat, we will bring the food when it's ready\". Which we found to be a nice touch.

They had 2 types of waffles, I opted for the harder version, which it was. The portion was great and had a ton of Nutella on it and even more whip cream. It was very sweet but really really good. 

My partners crepe was hot and perfectly made. I'm not a huge maple syrup fan but it was so lightly on there it just added a really nice sweetness to it.

The ice cream on both was of good quality and was frozen well so nothing was sloppy or melting all over.

I deducted a star only for the fact that it seemed a wee bit expensive (not unreasonably) but still this place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Really underwhelmed by the \"Belgian\" waffles and crepes here. The staff is clueless and very unresponsive/borderline rude. 

Ordered the Nutella crepe, \"Belgian\" waffle with strawberries, and \"Belgian\" waffle with ice cream. The crepe was greasy and heavy, they really shouldn't call it a crepe. The waffle was the furthest thing from a Belgian waffle. It was overly doughy and completely tasteless. 

From the price ($10 for a crepe that bad???? wtf!), quality, taste, and service I would never come here again. Ever."}
{"text":"Summary: Overpriced bad waffles

The waffle tasted kinda old/ stale. Probably one of the worst waffles that I've had to date. The nutella on top was fine. 

Its overpriced. $7 for a waffle (covered in nutella, and a bit of whipped cream), served in a plastic container. I think $4-5 max would be fairer. I couldn't figure out the pricing though... seems that a la carte toppings may be cheaper. So if you do go, my recommendation is just to get the waffle and add 1 topping. I think that should be around $5 or less. 

Staff are not friendly. 

There are way better desert places downtown."}
{"text":"This is the closest you will find to real Belgian (Liege) waffles in the city. Unfortunately, they don't use real pearl sugar in the waffles... so they're missing that delicious crunch and surprise sweetness you find in Europe. Otherwise, they're yummy."}
{"text":"Apparently this place opened 8 months ago. WHERE HAVE I BEEN? I have never noticed Wanda's until the other day when I was running - ducking a rainstorm. In the middle of my concentrated running, I was interrupted mid-step by the most alluring aroma, the scent of freshly-baked-something. I needed to get whatever it was in my mouth PRONTO! 

Back tracking our steps, Marie B. and I finally discovered what our taste buds were craving all along. FRESHLY BAKED BELGIAN WAFFLES! (IT'S ABOUT FRIGGIN TIME!) 

Even though I was mad full from my Salad King dinner and yes, this place is as big as a walk-in closet, there was no way I wasn't going to try some kind of waffle - no matter how small it needed to be. I ordered the chocolate dipped waffle and saved it for home time. 

I regret not bringing more home. The chocolate was a tad sweet, but good quality chocolate was indeed used. However, the next time I attend a potluck, I'm bringing a bunch of Wanda's naked Belgian Waffles to the party. Everyone is gonna think I'm a savior!"}
{"text":"I recently visited this hole in the wall stand near Dundas Square, and I have to say they make some really goodt waffles. They may be a bit expensive, but  they're worth the every penny. I recommend the maple syrup one with bananas. .it is really delicious! During my stay in Toronto I kept complaining I couldn't find a good Bagel (being a New Yorker!) but now I'd glady trade any bagel for one of these darn delicious waffles. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"You are kidding me, right?
Really...this is a joke.
When is an E-Listed celeb gonna jump out and say i was pranked, or on a hidden camera or something?

Wanda don't know waffles.

This stuff doesn't taste like a waffle, IT TASTES LIKE BREAD!!!  I think they take some Wonder bread, blend that stuff up and throw it on a griddle.

Get some eggo waffles instead.  Or - eat a loaf of bread."}
{"text":"Rude, slow and customer unfriendly service. Overpriced, tasteless and very disappointing desserts. Made in a clumsy way by guys that are totally clueless and unmotivated. This place was such a let down that i had just had to write a review to warn others. The owners of this place should have a good talk with the staff that's running this joint. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"The snacks are lovely but the service is slow and unprofessional, and we waited wayyyy to long for our snacks because only one person is working."}
{"text":"3.5stars to be exact. been meaning to try this place out for some time now, and oooh it's good! small little hallway of a store, a few tables in the back, and everything's either served on a paper plate or plastic to go containers. 

we ordered:
banana delight waffle with vanilla ice cream added, good.
original vanilla waffle, good. 

would have gotten a 4star if it wasn't as expensive as it is, i will definitely return, probably not as often as i'd like to tho."}

Atmosphere: not much of an atmosphere here. Not a lot of space to sit down either. Very narrow restaurant and the set up is a bit weird with the cash register in the front.

Taste: see above on presentation.

Portion: actually pretty large portions. Can share one between two people.

Service: what service? Staff there are not really friendly and not responsive."}
{"text":"We actually had plans to go elsewhere but that place was unfortunately closed early so we needed a quick alternative. Despite my previous 2 star review and skepticism of coming back, this place was the closest and we were feeling desserts so we gave it another shot. I'm quite sad to say that it still sucks.

The waffle was undercooked, too doughy, and too dense. The server also never asked for what flavour ice cream we wanted. The fruits were alright but that's something hard to mess up if you're just cutting them up. For the price that they're selling it at, it's definitely not worth your money.

I am now CERTAIN that I will never be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Wanda many times in the last few years. Usually go after a dinner to fulfill a chocolate craving as it's open later than most places.

I usually get the chocolate ice cream on top of of their original waffle. I'd say it's good as it satisfies my cravings :).

Solid 3.5 as it's good but nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Not the best place to have a belgian waffle. the dough taste like it's not well cooked and it's served on a plastic container. I think it would be more appetizing if they served it on a ceramic/glass plate.

I only gave 1 more star just because the service is good. Otherwise, they need to improve so many things."}
{"text":"Wanda's Belgian Waffles - every time you walk by and smell the aroma of butter, eggs and vanilla - you just want to go in there and experience one. Today I finally did! 

I had purchased a TeamBuy ticket not long ago when Wanda's was doing a $7 for a panini, chocolate dipped waffle and beverage.  The server/cashier was so sweet!  She was very helpful and had a great sense of humour.  The level of customer service here is definitely 5 stars.  

We ordered a roast chicken panini.  I didn't try it as I had overindulged this morning at the Hoof Café, and was still trying to digest that.  From the looks of it though, it looked pretty tasty.  The waffles themselves are a bit disappointing.  It smells wonderful - but is virtually tasteless.  It was really dry, and a bit on the salty side.  The chocolate was not silky smooth and kind of left a filmy texture in my mouth.  I could also taste a bit of the baking powder/soda.  I guess its one of those things that smells better than it tastes!

We had placed the order all together and by the time we got around to the waffle, it was already cold.  The server/cashier was such a sweetheart.  She apologized not knowing that we were eating it as dessert, and made us a fresh one!  Again, I loved the amount of attention, care and sincerity that was displayed at Wanda's... Now if only they could find the recipe for the perfect Belgian Waffle!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I shared a regular waffle, which came with mounds of whipped cream and a mountain of strawberry along with some chocolate sauce, and a crepe with vanilla ice cream and mixed fruits.

Although the coffee was not as strong as my boyfriend's liking, I thought both crepe and waffle were delicious. The crepe was perfectly prepared: pale in colour, not too thick, not too thin, and slightly chewy.

You may find cheaper crepes or waffles, but for the amount of whipped cream/fruits you get along with a waffle/crepe, I am OK with paying a little bit more."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing, and delicious. I have been here a few times, introducing this to my friends and family, and everyone LOVES it. The atmosphere is homey, and you feel welcomed by the staff. I've tried both the waffles, and the crêpes and both are super delicious, like I couldn't be able to just pick one (keep in mind I go with a bunch of friends so we all share LOL)

Their pistachio ice cream is to DIEEEEEEEEEE for.  YUMMY!!

One downfall for this place is the plates they serve you with ... Paper plates :(

But overall: YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE :)"}
{"text":"Is not a real disappointment  for the price, but if you are seeking for real Belgium waffles this is NOT the place, basic ingredients for a normal fast food experience, it looks good though and the exotic fresh fruit crepe was nice and full of fruit, for 10 dollars not bad choice. Regular and simple coffee"}
{"text":"Lured in by the smell (these guys are great marketers) but was disappointed by the boring waffle. 
The do a great job of making Yonge St smell better, but charge a lot for a tiny waffle without much taste."}
{"text":"Wanda's is a staple for late night desserts when you are near YD. It is one of the few dessert joints that open until 2-3am (Marble Slab nearby closes around midnight). The waffle quality is decent, belgian style, small dense chewy caramelized waffles. They are known for their waffles rather than their crepes for a reason. The crepes batter lack sweetness/flavour.

What I dislike here are their ice creams by the take out window! Not recommended, even if you see those $1 or $2 advertisement boards outside. They usually melt as soon as you buy it and are not tasty, seems low quality compared to the ice cream picks you get inside with your waffle, so that $1-2 is just going to the floor and maybe your shirt too.

Recommended only when you crave dessert really late in this area as there aren't many other dessert options besides the 24 hour McDonalds across the street (McFlurries are fine with me!)."}
{"text":"Let's be serious, how could a freshly made Belgian waffle topped with your choice of ice cream and drizzled in chocolate not be delicious? This was absolute perfection. It definitely tastes as good as it looks!"}
{"text":"Waffles and ice cream are delicious. The coffee is ok. The cappuccino is a disaster. The service is hit or miss. Sometimes it's fast and friendly, other times it's sooooooo slooowwww and the cashier will get confused by little things like if you ask for a receipt."}
{"text":"Not to be a Debbie downer, but once you've had real Belgian waffles just any waffle wont do. This waffle cafe is great for the price and amount of product you receive, but being that Ive had Waffles and Dinges waffle truck in New York nothing compares. But like I said, for the price and quantity its fine. I wasn't a fan of the waffle recipe, didn't seem sweet enough to me."}
{"text":"Guilty as charged, I'm officially a fatty. I've had Wanda's twice this week! My sister and I ended up at Wanda's during a late night drive from home because we were craving something sweet and maybe because we had a couple of glasses of wine lol. It was amazing as always but instead of a waffle I got a crepe which was just as delicious as the waffle. Again, I got the special that came with vanilla ice cream, caramel drizzle, icing sugar, and fresh fruit--definitely didn't disappoint. 

I love that this location has a decent amount of seating and the server was extremely friendly. By far my favourite location."}
{"text":"Ordered waffle with chocolate chip ice cream (to change the flavor from vanilla, it's an additional 50cents.. not bad). It was yummy and made fresh before your eyes. That's always an added touch that I find is a great selling point for any business. This location offers an indoor and outdoor eating area.  The patio is what I always opt for in the summer time. Open late, and did I mention they sell bubble tea?"}
{"text":"Walked in because all other bubble tea places were closed so we chose to come here. Initially noticed things were served on paper plates, must not have much budget for cutlery. Ordered two bubble teas by had to wait a significantly long time because there was only one lady taking orders and making drinks. Upon waiting the lady made the wrong drink for my boyfriend, causing us to have to wait again. After she made the correct drink, I just inquired if we could have the other drink, as it would probably go to waste. In a rude manner, she replied 'what, are you going to pay for it?' So if you'd like cheap cutlery, sub pay service and to be rudely treated as a paying customer, definately reach this place!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I got lured in by the person handing out flyers for Wanda's Waffles outside the shop. I'm glad I did, though - it was a darn good waffle! I ordered the Strawberry Delight: a Belgian-esque waffle with whipped cream, chocolate sauce, and fresh strawberries. The waffle was made right before my eyes with the girl reaching into the case and putting a dollop of fresh dough right on the griddle. Due to the threat of rain (and the fact that the place doesn't look like a very comfortable place to eat in and linger over dessert), I took my waffle to go and devoured it as soon as I got in the door of my nearby apartment. I didn't even share and was sad that the pleasure of this waffle had ended so soon. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We come from Rochester once a year and we come to Wanda's at least twice per visit. Waffles and ice cream. Outstanding."}
{"text":"There are so many places I end up trying simply because they're open late. This is another one of them.

I came to Wanda's just 10 minutes before closing on a Saturday night. While most staff take this time to mail it in before the end of their shifts, the lone staff member here was enthusiastic and welcomed us with open arms. He took each of our orders and even gave us recommendations and helped us customize them (this was 10 minutes before closing!).

I had the traditional waffle with ice cream. The waffle's freshness melted the ice cream right away, so each bite was full of cookies n' cream waffle-y goodness. I'd highly recommend this place for snack at any time of day.

Tip: Go inside and check out the fruit drinks in the fridge. I had the cantaloupe one, it's surprisingly good."}
{"text":"Waffle is buttery; has a crisp outer shell and the inside is fluffy and moist.
Icecream comes in different unique flavours.
Staff is really friendly as well.

SO WORTH :)"}
{"text":"Wanda's has a friendly staff and great food. I went there every morning on my last trip to Toronto. The waffles taste great and are made fresh. My friend got a panini and it was just as good as the waffles.  Once they began to recognize me, they started hooking me up with little extras."}
{"text":"Decent waffles and crepes in the Downtown area with an added bonus that it's open later than most other stores in the area - until 2am! Staff aren't that friendly, and the place is quite cramped and messy, but their food is okay."}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream special waffle for 5 dollars. it was perfect for 2 people. 

Took a few minutes to prepare, there is limited seating but it's worth it. the people at the counter are very nice as well.

I am giving this place 5 stars because it satisfied our sweet tooth and was freshly prepared for us. 

Go here and get the waffles, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had the ice cream special for about $5 and it was pretty good. Super sweet, but if you're craving a good dessert, it hits the sugar sweet spot. Vanilla ice cream was really good, though the waffle could have been more crunchy and less frozen."}
{"text":"First review: Our server had a lot of attitude :-( waffles were thick and tasty but I wouldn't pay full price for them (I used a groupon). Won't be back.

Second review: Somehow I went back (due to the urging of a friend). Much better service this time. Had the waffle with strawberries and whipped cream and it was delicious. Service might be slow though because I saw there was only one person working (which is kind of weird). But the waffle was heavenly so I will be back (I guess I'm glad my friend persuaded me to go again)."}
{"text":"The waffle is way too small to pay their high prices they have. It's too overrated, service is good but the quality very bad. Small portions and the waffle wasn't fresh"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dessert there after lunch today! The woman running the place was very nice and took great care of us. And the waffles were amazing. My kids want to go back tomorrow."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! When we walked in, we were greeted by a staff/waffle maker that was pretty cold and rude. He asked if we wanted a crepe or waffle. We said waffle and he told us to go to the front of the store to order. You order the crepes at the back of the store. There are two counters. We ordered an ice cream waffle for about $6.50 (tax included) and went to look for seats, while he made the waffle. When we got the waffle, it tasted uncooked. The batter didn't taste like waffle batter. The waffle itself was hard. It just wasn't good at all. There were two workers (our waffle guy and the crepe guy). They were bickering at each other while we were seated. Pretty unprofessional if you asked me! 

Save yo money and go for bbtea instead!"}
{"text":"A crepe filled with Nutella. A waffle covered with Belgian chocolate. A recipe for deliciousness? Sadly not.

Firstly the crepe was too thick. It way overpowered the measly amount of Nutella inside. I like my crepe thinner, less chewy, so the Nutella oozes with every bite. Likewise, the waffle was strangely dense and just not good.

Wanda, it's time to re-assess your crepe and waffle technique."}
{"text":"My first trip to Wanda's was almost 3 years ago, i was walking down Yonge Street and in need of some Breakfast and thanks to Wanda's being the only place actually open and serving breakfast I wandered in and got some kind of a chicken style sandwich and ever since that day I have been coming back. 

Saturday was Canada Day and after watching the fireworks we thought, what better way to end the night then with a trip to Wanda's? and boy was that the truth!. This was my second time at this location and although it's not very big, it usually has enough space to move around and at least sit. I ended up ordering a vanilla milk shake and a chocolate dip (basically a waffle dipped in delicious chocolate). Now If it wasn't for the milkshake, I would of given this place 5 stars but the milkshake let me down. Upon taking my first sip I realized something, it was really just a cup of milk with a few ice chunks in it (you know, not a milkshake). Now maybe I'm being generous because of how good everything else I've had on the menu is, but I'm only going to dock them one star for this (although I'm definitely not going to order another milkshake from here. The waffle itself was fantastic and just what I needed to finish off the night. If you are looking for a light meal or a tasty treat, Wanda's will definitely do the trick!"}
{"text":"I remember my first impression of this place

it looked good, as I ordered my chocolate waffle with ice cream I looked over at the counter, I noticed something odd.

a montecristo cigarillo box

I opened it and to my surprise found 4 tiny delicious Cuban cigars, I quickly shoved the box in my pocket, paid for my waffle and left.

The cigars were delicious, and the waffle was equal. Knowing the good fortune this place has brought me I will be back again for sure, delicious warm chocolaty waffles with ice cream for $5 (big ass waffles too) what more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"I stopped in to Wanda's looking for a sandwich, oddly enough. I left with my sandwich and a maple waffle with a side of banana. No regrets!

As Connie mentioned, the maple waffle is a special treat with maple chips worked into the batter right before it's made to order for you. Maybe the best waffle I've had, especially with the side of banana. The variety of choices this place offers is pretty fantastic, and I look forward to patronizing it again to check out what else is waiting for me.

As far as my sandwich went, it was underwhelming. I'm pretty sure I received poached chicken where it advertised roasted, and there was just a random mish-mash of vegetables tossed into my panini (seemed more like a salad sandwich than anything). It was definitely tasty, but nothing at all exceptional. Go for the waffles and you won't be disappointed.
Frankly I was impressed that the off-season strawberries I saw getting piled onto other people's plates looked so good!"}
{"text":"Just finished an all-you-can-eat dinner at the Korean Grill House down the street when I stopped by Wanda's Belgian Waffles. Had passed by it on the way to dinner and promised myself I would come back afterward. The shop is aromatic and unavoidable. Ordered a regular maple waffle as well as a regular waffle topped with caramel and vanilla ice-cream. Delicious! 

The place sells sandwiches too, but waffles are what it's known for. The shop is small and cozy. There's no place to sit, and even the standing room is very cramped. There's usually a small line leading into the shop. Waffles are made fresh. An impatient man asks you what you want, and then throws the mix onto a waffle grill. 

Worth the wait. Worth the impatient man's attitude. Worth the $3 waffle and $2 toppings. Well worth the obese look in the mirror!"}
{"text":"The deal with the waffles and coffee for under $5 had my dancers coming back almost every morning for their breakfast and coffee.
I'm not a regular coffee drinker but I do fancy a good cup of illy coffee. My judgement for a good cup of joe: if I can drink the coffee black with no added sugar, milk/cream then it is a good cup!
They serve illy here and the waffles are good when its fresh off the waffle maker. 
The slow service is a little annoying and they seem to hire people that really hates their job."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday with a friend to check the place out, ordered a Berry Blast smoothie and ice cream crepe. The service was slow considering there was only one staff present. Once we received our order the ice cream crepe was disappointing as it was just a scoop of ice wrapped in a small crepe topped with chocolate sauce and icing sugar; upon tasting it was alright nothing great. The smoothie was probably the best smoothie I ever tasted, better than Booster Juice, which I highly recommend. Overall the environment of the place was warm in which you can have talks.. however not the greatest decoration of the place or set up. Pricing was alright but would not recommend it for dessert go to Caffe Demetre for proper crepes and waffles."}
{"text":"This is a pretty small location located next to a strip club (Zanzibar) on Yonge Street.  Who can resist posters of half naked female strippers and the sweet scent of waffles?  The waffle I had was quite filling although very soft tasting, sweet, with whipped cream on top but tasty overall.   I would definitely go back if the opportunity permits or whenever I'm in the mood to have some Belgian style waffles with strippers getting ready for work :)"}
{"text":"Got the belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream and fudge! It was super satisfying and really good. The waffle was a little small for how much we paid, but it was good :)"}
{"text":"Doughy waffles with no taste, the only saving grace for this place is that the strawberries actually tasted real. Don't waste your time, you are on Yonge Street, there are lots of better options."}
{"text":"Delicious!

Okay, I'm a bit of a waffle-holic after spending the summer in Scandinavia. In Reykjavik there's an amazing little waffle wagon that serves delicious waffles into the wee hours of the morning for the partying crowds. This is the closest thing I've found to that in North America.

This place offers lots of different options for your waffles. My first time I went with the cinnamon waffle and cream topping. The second time I had a plain waffle with ice cream and maple syrup. I probably took a few minutes off the end of my life, but oh, was it worth it. They were very good! I especially liked the cinnamon one.

The prices vary quite a bit depending on what options you get. Some of them are probably overpriced, so just be sensible and look at the prices before you order!

I was a little disappointed by the size of the waffle. I was expecting a full rectangle, but they just put a dollop of batter on so you don't get a full waffle. Still, in the end it was actually a pretty good portion and more might have been a bit too much.

My only other real complaint is from an environmental standpoint. They put the waffles in kind of ridiculous plastic clamshells, and then one can walk over to Eaton Centre and see a garbage can full of these things. I think a very minimal paper tray would have been sufficient. Maybe they could offer both options.

Anyway, bottom line: Delicious waffles! Be sensible and don't order something that's going to cost an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"OMG, the \"waffle\" is full of doughy stuffie batter. Its almost like eating fat or lard in my mouth... OMG... not really recommended. Smell good though. And the server was friendly."}
{"text":"I think it's the worst service I've ever had....the food is good tho but I should have to wait 30 minutes to order a waffle..."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. 
First of all, completely overpriced - we paid around $16 for a nutella waffle with bananas and a banana milkshake. 
Which would be fine if the waffle didn't taste like it was pre-packaged and microwave-reheated with a tiny bit of nutella and whipped cream on top. The milkshake wasn't any good either; watery and very artificial tasting. (Also, for a $5 milkshake, I'd expect whipped cream on it - just saying.) 
However, the real issue with this place is the abysmal customer service. The older woman behind the counter started yelling at me when I pointed out to her that I paid extra ($3 extra!) to get bananas on my waffle, which I had received sans-bananas. After insisting that I hadn't requested or paid for extra bananas (this had literally happened less than five minutes ago and she was the one who took my order and rang me up), she told me that I needed to calm down because she hadn't eaten or had a break in 12 hours or something like that. How is that my problem? How is that an excuse to freak out on customers? I just wanted my darn overpriced bananas. She was also yelling at the young man behind the counter with her at every opportunity she got. 
Anyways, in the end I got my bananas, but if my boyfriend wasn't such a gentle soul I would have told them to keep their bananas and demanded my money back. 
I will NEVER EVER come back to Wanda's, and I'll tell everyone I know not to go here. There are way better options in the area for waffles and dessert, where you won't get your head bitten off by short-fused employees."}
{"text":"A solid 2.5 stars, depending on what you want.  For students, it is fine, perhaps for 1st or 2nd year lol.

Real date?  Nah...ambience isn't there but really, the leige didn't have the texture I'm used to, at a real French bakery for example.

Not an open layout, a bit narrow.

Just watch your steps."}
{"text":"I went here after a sushi lunch with a group. The main event should have been the waffles but the consensus of the group was that these waffles were crisp on the outside and doughy / uncooked on the inside. I think they might have set the temperature of the waffle iron too high or something. They did have crepes , but we were too scared to try if they couldn't get the one item they should get right. Meanwhile the manager and employee kept arguing while serving the customers (amongst themselves of course) but that is generally a red flag of a business gone bad. Only reason we went here is because just desserts was closed till 4 for some reason. Should have waited for just desserts."}
{"text":"A Wanda's waffle makes for a tasty treat.  There are now at least two locations (at Yonge and Wellesley and at Yonge and Gerrard).  The Yonge and Gerrard location (361 Yonge Street) has a small seating area.  The smell is amazing - you know you are about to see a Wanda's location by the smell that you encounter way before you get there.

I like the street-food atmosphere - the storefront is basically right out on the sidewalk - you order through the window, pay, and your waffle gets passed back out to you when it's ready.  I ate my waffle standing on Yonge Street while I people-watched.

I had a chocolate dip waffle, which was $3.99 plus tax.  It is not really chocolate \"dipped\" - they actually pour chocolate sauce over the hot waffle before they give it to you.  At first I worried they might be using Hershey's syrup, but the chocolate turned out to be better than that.  The waffle was very hot, dense (as it should be), and crunchy on the outside. 

Wanda's also serves waffles with ice cream or with fruit (or both), but next time I will forgo that and try one of the maple waffles that some previous reviewers have mentioned."}
{"text":"Se você passar na frente deste lugar, talvez nem o perceba. Não é muito diferente, não chama a atenção e é super pequeno. Maaaaaaas... É famoso por aqui.
Aos amantes de waffle, talvez esse seja o lugar certo.
Eles têm diferentes combinações de waffle com calda quente, chocolate, morango, chantilly e muito mais.
O waffle é crocante por fora e fofinho por dentro, perfeito!
O preço é razoável, já que a comida é de qualidade, mas vale a pena.
Já o lugar é bem pequeno, tem poucas mesas para sentar. Você faz o pedido na entrada, pega e depois se senta, é assim que funciona.
Recomendo!"}
{"text":"Being from Belgium is was refreshing to find a place that makes good waffles. Thoroughly enjoy them and I'm sure you'll agree once you try them."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to stopping by this place on my date night with wife. I walked over from Cinepelx at around 12:45, plenty of time before the 2 am closing time. I was informed that they were closing up for the night. I also saw customers eating there when we walked in. I am not sure why we were turned away from this establishment."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a group buy voucher, and these guys treated us like GOLD. They threw in an extra waffle and free coffee (on an already discounted price), they were super attentive, and the ice cream on waffles was fantastic. T"}
{"text":"Most prominent thing to me: the taste of the waffle. It was unlike any waffle I've had before.   Despite being covered in cold toppings, it was warm, dense and crispy. The texture was not lift and fluffy like the waffles I'm used it. It had a bit if a grainy texture. My friend said it tasted raw but we both agreed that we liked it. We shared the \"exotic fruit waffle\". It had a variety of fruit. Pineapple, strawberry, raspberries, blackberry, banana... The whip cream was super light and fluffy.
One thing I did not like was the size of the waffle. It was the smallest waffle I've ever seen. It was gone way too quick. The fruit and whip cream made up 3/4 of what was given. I feel like the main dessert is just fruit! Also when dining in, food is served on a paper plate and plastic cutlery is used. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. They also do not give any cups for water."}
{"text":"Next to a topless bar, is this cute nondescript waffles/sweets place. I stopped in and had some amazing pistachio baklava pastry. The owner was super kind as well and even went out of his way to ask me how strong I liked my coffee. I'd definitely come here again! Thanks for the hospitality."}
{"text":"Decent Belgian-style waffles-- dough based rather than batter based -- that could be excellent if they worked on their recipe and made the waffles fresh.

Waffles that come in four flavours ($2.57-2.86): vanilla, cinnamon, maple, and strawberry. A variety of toppings like chocolate ($1.70), ice cream ($2.50), or fruit ($2.50) are also on offer but each will add substantially to the price.

I had a cinnamon waffle with chocolate dip. The chocolate dip was good but I found the waffle a little dry and the texture was off. I'm pretty sure they're precooking the waffles and just heating them up. Still delicious but could have been better.

American style waffles as well as sandwiches are also available."}
{"text":"I just love their waffels. I ate here three times, freshly made super delicious Belgian waffel. Once I tried their cheesecake despite that I'm not so fond of cheesecakes, but that was also reaaly good. I can only recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was one of the best things I ate on my 10 day trip.  I ordered the maple waffle with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.  White chocolate hot chocolate was on the menu, so I had to try that as well.  Boy, I'll tell you what, this place changed my life.  I'll never look at a waffle the same way.  It was thick, flavorful, rich, dense, and the ice cream was fabulous too. The hot chocolate was to die for.  Literally.  I almost died drinking it, it was so good.  I'd for sure hit this place up again if I had the chance.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This place really is fantastic! They get me every time I walk by even after I ate....

It is expensive though and if you like the ice cream fruit and all that jazz...it's around $12?  I think...

Good but expensive!"}
{"text":"Sure, I stopped here after having a few drinks and I was peckish, so perhaps I'm not in the right frame of mind to rate this clearly. One thing they have going for them is that they were open until 2am. I walked in at 1:55 and they were happy to serve me. Often when you do this, the staff roll their eyes because they want to close. Service was good, waffle guy knew what he was doing, but the waffle wasn't great. A little too bready for my liking, so I'll still give this an A-OK. I'll stop here late night if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The only thing that tops a big thick made-to-order Belgian waffle is having a gigantic scoop of ice cream on top of one. I guess a dip into some gooey caramel doesn't hurt either - unless you've got an unfilled cavity, that is.

Besides coffee, the cold beverage selection is surprisingly dizzying. Of just aloe drinks, there are original, blueberry, strawberry, and mango to choose from. I found this to be a bit of a culture flavour clash, but I 
had to try the blueberry, which was actually quite good.

It would've been nice to sit outside on this beautiful warm night, but there are only three street facing stools and they had already been taken. Although too bright on the border of feeling sterile, the inside is air conditioned and filled with the heavenly smell of waffle batter."}
{"text":"I had the waffle with ice cream and caramel sauce. It was so good that I had to get some more to take home! They have take away containers with 4 waffles-- I got the plain waffles and also couldn't resist getting chocolate dipped ones. Having them in the morning slightly warmed, with fruits and a hot cup of coffee makes for a dreamy breakfast."}
{"text":"Waffles, crepes and hot drinks were very good. This will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth. 
I'm knocking off 1 star because the lady at the register seemed impatient and almost a little rude. And we were served on paper Christmas plates. Real plates and cutlery would have been nice."}
{"text":"Expensive but oh so delicious!!!

Two types of waffles are available, with or without sugar. And then you can load on the toppings. I had ice cream and caramel sauce, my friend had strawberries, whipped cream, and chocolate fudge. Just the sound of that makes my mouth water. The place is pretty small, so don't expect to get a seat during busy hours. Service is a little slow, and they will charge you extra for using your credit card."}
{"text":"A good price for a small portion just to satisfy that sweet craving of yours. The waffles tasted kind of dry and stale to me; not the best dessert place in town. Although it smells amazing every time I walk pass here. 

I ordered the Special Ice Cream. It comes with a piece of waffle with a scoop of ice cream and syrup dressing of your choice. I chose the cherry cheesecake ice cream flavour and it tasted nothing close to cheesecake which made me a bit disappointed... It tasted more like vanilla ice cream with a  hint of cherry. 

It made me question their sanitary level due to what the worker told me there. My friends and I asked him what flavours he had and he listed them and recommended us not to get the maple syrup one. He told us it's been lying around for sometime and everytime he removes it from the display, someone always ends up bringing it back.. So beware! Unless you don't mind having a stomachache. This also makes me question the other items on the menu.."}
{"text":"Oh boy, ice cream and waffles? Maybe the most dangerous mix for my waistline imaginable. They have a nutella option on the menu, too, in which they bake your waffle up fresh while you wait, then slather it with a generous covering of the good stuff. Then, they drop a couple scoops of the ice cream of your choice. I went with vanilla, but they also had praline, chocolate, strawberry, mint, and cookie dough. The delightful ice cream special with nutella costs $9.64, a bit steep, but it was decadent and delicious. And a short walk from Yonge-Dundas Square/Ryerson. If a place like this was around when I was in college, I might not have survivied the four years."}
{"text":"Dropped by Wanda's Belgian Waffles on a Freezing -20 C winter evening...

Greeted by this nice gentleman... who treated us like VIP since we are the only patrons.

Basic Waffles with Vanilla Ice cream tasted A-OK. Yes the texture is more dense and can be heavy. But it was perfect to be shared with a friend as a light after dinner snack.

I really can't stand the plastic containers they serve their waffles... if we are eating in.. can it be on a plate???

Great hours though, they close at 2 AM on weekends!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first night in Toronto, and I was on the prowl for some dessert. Near the cacauphonus intersection of Yonge and Dundas (there was a huge stage set up with a Celtic-Indian fusion band), I stumbled upon a waffle shop. Being an American, waffle shops have only existed in my dreams. I've heard tell of them before, but I have never felt the thrill of a warm, Belgian waffle with powdered sugar in a little wax paper holder. It is a small storefront, with cramped standing room for 2 or 3 people inside the door.

It must be a new restaurant, because many people stopped to gawk at the menu, but few seemed up to the task of ordering. Flavored waffles? What? Toppings? Huh? Trust me, order anything, it doesn't matter. During my short stay in Toronto, I tried plain, strawberry, and maple waffles and every kind of topping. Caramel, chocolate sauce, ice cream... This stuff is healthy, right? I figure waffles are breakfast, and breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so a second breakfast is like twice as healthy.  The warm waffle, the soft ice cream. Incredible.

There were a lot of people outside the storefront deciding whether to order or not, and if I hadn't been stuck inside waiting for mine, I probably would've been shilling for Wanda's on the sidewalk. \"No, you have to try it! Just order one! It's so good!\""}
{"text":"I love love love Wanda's. Where do I start? So they have a few different options of things to get here. If you just want waffles you can go to the window at the front and order there. If you want any of their other items you have to go inside. Other items include crepes, sandwiches and milkshakes. 
My go to is the strawberry banana crepe. Now you can get this with or without ice cream. 
Either way everything is made right there once you order. The place can get pretty busy at times, especially if there is something going on nearby. 
Another amazing thing about Wanda's is they're open late, so if you're feeling crepes at midnight this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of overly sweet desserts - but this place has some killer waffles. I'm not a big waffle expert or anything, but I feel like I could eat their waffles forever.

I ordered the Strawberry Waffle (with chocolate sauce, strawberries, and whipped cream). It was amazing!!

The only complaint that I would have is that once there is a line-up, you end up waiting a long time. And the decor is.. lacking."}
{"text":"Ice cream special is good but have a small, quality selection of ice cream. Two sofas in the back if you want to get cozy."}
{"text":"The waffles are just awesome!!!!! Way better than any waffles I've ever tried!!!! So awesome!!! The owner added much more fruits and toppings than others. Awesomely great and I gonna try the original flavor next time!!!"}
{"text":"This place was near our hotel and open late. That waffle was some of the best food I had while in Toronto; it was freshly cooked and had a crispy outside and fluffy middle. I ate mine covered in chocolate sauce and whip cream :)"}
{"text":"Only came here because all other coffee & dessert options nearby were full on a Friday night. After watching a movie at Yonge & Dundas, this was a close option. Food was meh (crepe was a little undercooked) and price was average, but atmosphere is poor (very small space, dated decor, and the use all disposable dishware) and service was very, very slow."}
{"text":"I've walked past this little shop many times when I'm downtown but have never gotten a chance to try it out. Today was the day that I decided to try out some waffles at Wanda's.

The place is very small and there are about 3-4 tables for guests to sit at. However, me and my friend dropped by when it was empty so we didn't have any issues with seating. I think it's pretty cute how they have an open window at the front of the store so people can just order right from the sidewalk.

I ordered their original waffle with ice cream and it came out to $5.74. Btw, they will charge you if you pay by credit card. I think it's a bit pricey but the deliciousness made up for the cost. My friend got the same thing but she added strawberries to hers and it was ~$10.

The waffle tasted yummy, cakey, and sweet. I've only had waffles at Demetre's before and it never had any flavour compared to Wanda's.

I would definitely drop by here again when I'm in the area but not all the time because I don't want to get fat lol. Now I am going to look for a waffle maker so I can indulge in the comfort of my own home =)."}
{"text":"If you have ever walked North on Yonge from Dundas you must have definitiely come across Wanda's and incase you have not followed your nose to her doorsteps you must have definitely been hit in the face by the sweet wafting aroma that is a freshly made waffle.

It's a tiny narrow shop with a few tables and seating in the back with a flat screen tv. This establishment is not really meant for dining in however they do lend the option. Everything is served in clear plastic takeout containers with plastic cutlery ready to eat on the go. The simple menu offers waffles, crepes, ice cream, toasted sandwiches, and hot/cold beverages.

I was here strictly for the waffle. A smiling face greeted me at the enterance and asked how can I help you. I think she assumed were taking our waffle to go. We acknowledged we were here to stay so she proceeded to the back counter to assist us. She cheerfully went over the menu options including the various ice cream flavours and toppings offered.

I decided on the:

Wanda's Original Vanilla Waffle w/ icing sugar topped with Chocolate sauce and Chocolate Ice Cream.  =$5.98 including tax.

We took our seats and she told us she'd bring it over when it was ready.

The waffle arrived hot and crispy, dusted with icing sugar, drizzled in the hot belgian chocolate sauce topped mounds of creamy chocolate ice cream and drapped with more chocolate sauce. There is something so devine about cold creamy ice cream paired with a sweet hot crispy waffle. It's like a heaven on earth experience especially when you drizzle it with belgian chocolate sauce that is melting on the hot waffle but hardening on the cold ice cream. The contrast of textures and temperatures is something everyone needs to, no Must Try!! 

What they lack in decor here they definitely make up for in taste and quality! Delicious crispy hot waffles, that smell doesn't lie, it is truly worth following your nose for!"}
