{"text":"Well, first let's clarify that this is a hospital cafeteria.  As you walk in, however, it is open and very clean.  Three separate stations offering fresh made foods.  In the mornings there is an omelet station, and a regular breakfast fare (biscuits & Gravy, sandwiches, made to order eggs) station.  I won't say it's stellar but it is refreshing that it is fresh foods mostly, and made griddle top.  The sides are good and the portions they give you are excellent.  All the folks working are always very polite.  I won;t say I would make s special trip to grab anything, but as I was stuck in the hospital for several days, there was a good deal of variety and it was alright.  They also have doors leading out to a very nice covered porch complete with large ceiling fans, so you can actually get outside.  There is an area right next to patio that has nice plants, and a tall wall to keep out traffic noise so you do have somewhat of a respite.  As i said, not stellar but for what it is, it is quite nice."}

My Stepson had Surgery earlier this week and I drove down to meet my wife and daughter-in-law at the CMC-Pineville. When I pulled in, they sent me a txt to say that they were in the Cafeteria getting something to eat and to join them.

Hospital Food and I've had my share normally ranks well below a one star and  you eat it only our of necessity.

Not here. 

I was blown away.  Grill was still open and I had one of the best Cheeseburgers along with Fries that I have ever had.

They have either a weekly or daily theme and that day it was Brazil. Note the Brazil Flag in the picture of the Check Out.

If parking was not such a premium, I would consider the place as a regular for lunch."}
{"text":"Look, no one WANTS to be at the hospital, but when you need to be, or have to be, you're in some luck. The Cafe of the Carolinas is the cafeteria in CMC Pineville. I found the selection and the quality of the food to be very good, and especially for a hospital-based location!! They offer salads, sandwiches, hot foods including a daily selection of vegetables. And, by the way... you gotta try that Mac-n-Cheese!!! 
The breakfasts are excellent!! 
Note that there is a Starbucks at the entrance. Thus, they can't sell regular coffee. That's why I gave four stars. Otherwise, I recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is in a hospital.  Other than one very miserable worker at the register, the place is very good... especially considering it is in a hospital.  I was there with my sons visiting a patient.  Across the 3 of us, we got cheeseburgers, chicken tenders, fries and onion rings.  The rings are huge but a tad greasy.  The rest was very good.  

They also have entrees that vary, a deli, a salad bar and pizza.  Plenty of drink options as well."}
