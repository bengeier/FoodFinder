{"text":"Food is really good . Tastes homemade! I love their paneer and Aloo paranthas. All their veggie dishes are tasty and not crazy spicy like other places in the area. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Typical Punjabi style restaurant that you'll find in abundance in the area, recently offer burgers and fries (which are quite good!) to set them apart from a very crowded (and good) market. Just like most joints in the area, food is decent and consistent."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not bad at all. Went there on a whim. Had two things. The fried veggie snack (Pakora) and the grilled chicken kebab. Pleasantly surprised. Tons of flavour in both. Slightly on the spicy side. (Warning in advance!) Didn't need any condiments on the side for dipping.   Haven't had anything else yet so couldn't justify 5 stars right away. But next time for sure going in with high hopes!"}
{"text":"Good place for take out Indian (Punjabi) food. Conveniently located if you live in the area. Price isn't bad. I usually just get naan and a couple curries. Order the naan 10 min ahead of time because they make it fresh. They have 6 or 7 curries ready to pick from when you get there."}
