{"text":"They carry boars head, which I normally eat at home. The sandwich they made tasted stale or just off from the way it should have.  I paid somewhere around 8 dollars for a sub par sandwich, I would avoid unless you are in a time crunch and need something to fill your stomach."}
{"text":"My sandwich was ok but it took them a ridiculously long time to make it and then for me to pay"}
{"text":"Wow, I'm really surprised that this place isn't on Yelp yet. I think this is a newer place at the PGH Intl Airport (they don't have a website which I think is both sketch and endearing) and if I remember right, this is where Au Bon Pain used to be. They offer healthy alternatives to the greasy airport fare you normally find such as wraps, soups, salads, smoothies and drinks.

I stopped by here twice this wknd-the first time was for lunch right after I arrived. Airport price wise, I was quite surprised with the prices-this place is cheap! I got the wrap and salad combo and thought that it was a traditional salad with lettuce but turns out you can choose a salad of your choice. I went with the veggie wrap and pesto salad which was around $8 plus I got a bottle of water along with that. Both items were very tasty and they are not shy with their portions (check the pics) Good times! The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the sun dried tomatoes. I am a fan of them but Nature's Kitchen likes them a little too much and between the pesto salad and wrap, it was too much for me. Ok....and the staff there reminded me of the kids in Dangerous Minds but besides that, I was a fan of this place."}
{"text":"The quality of food here is not good. The vegetables never look fresh. The guacamole was brownish in color, and the overall appearance of the prep area lacks cleanliness. I have given this place two tries and both times were equally as bad. The second time, I was told I could get a piece of fruit with my sandwich and was told \"I highly suggest going and washing that apple off before you eat it..\" What a shame to have an \"organic\" place be run so poorly. It seems to come down to a poorly managed/trained place."}
{"text":"Yucky

The food looked like it had been sitting out untouched. It was dry on the edges and discolored. I got the Greek salad because it looked fresh. It wasn't bad which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one. Service was horrible. The employees were slurring their words and barely coherent.  There were no other customers there so it wasn't like they were over worked. Despite the fact that I'm traveling with a laptop and huge purse no one offered a bag. That would have been too much work"}
{"text":"Breakfast panini good BUT owner has no respect for customers or other employees. Instead of serving the line he bitched on his cell phone over an employee who called out sick. He continued to not change his gloves as he picked his phone up and down, handled food and went in and out of the back room. When I mentioned it he thanked me and told me during emergencies it wasn't gonna happen and he proceeded to continue wearing same pair of gloves after touching cash machine. He said don't you ever have emergencies- I stated yes, routinely, but as an ICU nurse there are no excuses. He exclaimed- this isn't healthcare! Are kidding me! It takes a second to change gloves. Cash machines and cell phones are filthy not to mention I have no idea what he did in back room. 
-to clarify I did not let him touch my food. I had another employee ring me up who confirmed he was the OWner and never changes his gloves. YUCK!"}
{"text":"If you go in expecting airport food, you won't be impressed, but you shouldn't be too disappointed.

I've stopped by for lunch, and the pesto pasta salad is quite good.  In the morning, my latte is passable.  I wouldn't recommend the bagel, but on the other hand, it was more reasonably priced than the quiche or other breakfast foods.  The girls at the counter are friendly, but service is very slow.  The signage isn't clear as to where you line up to order what, so that definitely contributes to the confusion.

There's better options to be had in this airport, but Nature's Kitchen works in a pinch or if you don't want to go to one of the sit-down spots."}
{"text":"Stopped here while on my way to the gate the other week. I got a Greek salad with grilled chicken. It was good as far as airport food goes and is definitely worth a stop if you want something fresh and good. Just be sure that you get what you want, I had to ask for more toppings then lettuce. Overall, I'd go again if I was in a rush but there are better options if you aren't."}
{"text":"Waste of money. I got a sandwich and the quality was extremely poor. 90% dried out, crusty bread, and 10% actual ingredients that should be the main component of a sandwich. I ended up throwing most of it away. The avocado spread on my sandwich was a nice shade of brown. Slow, apathetic service. Definitely not what I expected from a place that appears to charge a premium for higher quality food."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients and somewhat healthy options.  The food doesn't look or taste like a chain.  Also, their mocha latte was excellent.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service again.   I know 5am is early but there were plenty of places serving breakfast. We stood waiting to order today. A girl looked at us, turned around to start the coffee, waited until it was finished then talked to an airport employee who walked to the counter. I asked her if she was going to help us and she stated \" I had to make coffee. Do you want to order?'. I told her no not from this place and walked over to another breakfast restaurant. The airport was extremely busy at 5am with many people eating. No one was in line at Natures Kitchen .... geez wonder why? Management/ ownership needs to seriously look at the customer service here..."}
{"text":"Meh. Fair food. Surly (even antagonistic) staff. They need to clean house (again) and start with new employees. Employees claimed that \"Airport regulations\" prohibit them from touching customers' coffee cups (I asked them to rinse mine before refilling it.)  Then the attitude they both copped was offensive and unwarranted."}
{"text":"Nature's Kitchen has multiple locations in Pittsburgh International Airport. This location is at the Center Core location.

Ordered a turkey sandwich on wheat with swiss cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions.  Also picked up a couple of bottles of cold water here.

Sandwich hit the spot!

Until Yelp corrects the address for this business listing - the correct address is:

Nature's Kitchen
Pittsburgh International Airport, Central Core
1000 Airport Blvd
Coraopolis, PA 15108"}
{"text":"Another example of foul misrepresented airport food. What a shame. Better off at Mc Donalds opposite I hate to say.."}
{"text":"I got a burnt black panini. No organization to the order/pick up line. Staff were all clinically depressed or just incompetent. The person wrapping my clearly burnt sandwich got halfway through before she gave up. Literally, she lost all will to complete the very simple action, and shoved my half wrapped blackened panini into a bag and handed it to me with a glazed look in her eye. I expensed the meal, so it was basically free for me, but I would pay my own money to go back in time and just eat a McCrap sandwich instead. A pox on your house, nature's kitchen! Nature's kitchen? More like nature's bathroom..."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about with the great prices here.  I got a cold piece of quiche, small spinach salad, banana, and drink for the low low price of $17.  Maybe I'm a cheapo, but I think that's a lot.  They have quiches and salads in the case that you can choose from - I wish the prices were marked on the case, it was a little hard to see the menus up above and find what I was looking for.

The food was good, but to me, not worth the price (plus, the spinach salad was on the bottom shelf of the case, which must be super cold because the eggs in it were literally frozen).  Service was not terrible, but not award-winning (only after answering a question about the quiches and then letting me choose which one I wanted did the guy behind the counter tell me that it wouldn't be heated, their microwave was broken. Thanks.), although the guy that checked me out (who may be the owner) was very nice.  

It's unfair to have this place right across from McDonalds so that you have to choose to empty your wallet or fill up your arteries.  I'll probably look for a better option down along one of the terminals next time."}
{"text":"I agree with gaby. it's pure sugar. not healthy at all!!! get the egg mcmuffin at mcdonalds..."}
{"text":"I travel through Pittsburgh frequently and tried this place last time. The wrap was a fresh alternative to traditional fast food  so I decided to give it another shot. After standing in front of the counter for a couple of minutes while the two men working chatted and ignored me I finally asked if they were able to take my order. The response I got was rude - \"just a tell me what you want.\" - annoyed that I interrupted him. Not like I had a flight to catch or anything. I said nothing and walked away. If this were my business  would want to know about this laziness and  lack of professionalism. I won't go back - don't care how good the food is if you have to be disrespected in the process."}
{"text":"I used to like this place because I thought they served \"healthier\" food options.  That's not the case at all, so don't be fooled by the name.  There are more choices at this food court now, so keep walking past this. 

The service has always been sub par to ok.  There has been a decline in quality of food. 

The bananas and fruits are over ripe, the breakfast sandwiches lack substance as in no meat and a small sad scrambled egg.   Today, I got a breakfast sandwich with turkey sausage and cheese on a croissant.  The sandwich was so flat and didn't even have cheese.  It was gross.  My husband's breakfast \"panini\" was definitely not a panini.  It didn't even have toasted bread.  It was scrambled eggs,  ONE string of soggy bacon as he called it, on non toasted white bread.  

That was a waste of $12 for 2 sandwiches.  At least we could've gotten hashbrowns and a drink of we went for Mcdonalds.  I will never eat here again, and I don't recommend this place."}
