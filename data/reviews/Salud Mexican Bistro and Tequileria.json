{"text":"This is my second time here. The service is terrific. The food is perfectly done. A lot of menu items are not usually available at a typical Mexican restaurant. It's a great find!"}
{"text":"The recipes were very original and the food was phenomenal. Everybody who works there from the bartender to the wait staff were very nice, it was a welcoming atmosphere. I am definitely coming back and bringing everyone I know who likes great Mexican food. Try the tacos, get one of each you will not regret it. And the margaritas, they definitely know what they are doing. Ever had a churro waffle? Do that too."}
{"text":"We just had dinner here for my husbands birthday and it was great! I brought my two kids who are picky about their plain cheese quesadillas and they accommodated them and even knew to bring out their food first! We had the munchies appetizer and it was so good we had to have a discussion on who deserved to get the last taquito. I had chicken tacos and my husband had what the server described as a \"bacon steak\" and I seriously highly recommend!! We both liked our food which is rare cause we have different tastes and we had fun eating there. Everyone is very nice and helpful and knowledgeable about their menu and drinks. Bring fiends and come enjoy this food! You won't leave disappointed"}
{"text":"Seriously great food and super nice staff. I'll be back many times. This is my new goto for fresh and unique Mexican. Not your sloppy, goopy canned over cheesy Mexican fare. Come hungry very large portions. Order the octopus!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a unique experience. The food is absolutely fantastic and the wait staff is very attentive from start to finish. I highly recommend trying the plate of 5 different types of tacos. The el pastor taco was out of this world! The churro waffle was an amazing dessert, which you can't find anywhere else in Vegas. The pictures alone of what I ate had so many friends asking for the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"You have to order the octopus!! It is literally the most tender, melt in your mouth amazing-ness !"}
{"text":"Words cannot explain how amazing this place was. There was nothing that wasn't stellar. We had made a reservation for my friends birthday (at 930 pm not knowing they closed at 10 pm). But never once did they make us feel like we had to leave. In fact, they treated us as if we were one of the crew. They hung out with us, danced with us, and took shots with us. They gave great recommendations on the food and it was all amazing, they even brought out a surprise birthday dessert for two of us (it was a weekend of birthdays!) The only thing we would have done differently would have been split some dishes because it was too much food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. The food is great - an elevated Mexican menu with sauces that are impeccable. Their service is also good. Run, don't walk to this restaurant. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"love this place, good food, great cocktails, awesome staff & well worth stopping by!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good but a little pricey for Mexican food. The service was very good for the most part. My only complaints were the food took awhile and our waitress messed up our Groupon. However the manager and staff did apologize for the problems."}
{"text":"Salud is the new place for Mexican food in Vegas! Great atmosphere and great service! Andres is the best owner! The cocktails are amazing and the service is the best"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant and very friendly staff. Food is delicious, specially Octopus Salteado and Guacamole Del Mar . Salud Caddy margarita is fantastic.I would definitely recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Great food!  The salsa trio is just amazing. Olive oil in my salsa?  Yes please!

The fundido was truly an experience. Great mix of flavors. Definitely one to come back for. 

Words don't describe the crab and shrimp chili relleno. Except maybe - wow, oh my, and amazing. 

Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is such a great off the strip Mexican restaurant.  The food is very good and they have an eclectic menu with outside of the box items like Mexican Gnocci and Salmon Tacos. I usually judge a Mexican restaurant based on the initial chip experience and the house garlic salsa was delicious, they even made me a special spicy salsa.  We also ordered the guacamole which was seasoned perfectly.  The Baja salmon tacos were really good and they nailed the refried beans.  They have a huge selection of tequila if you're a tequila buff.  Although we were full we were gluttonous and tried the tres leche flan and can affirm it was was worth the calories. The service was outstanding and everything came out to us really quickly. I would definitely recommend this spot for the food and service. The ambience is just ok, I would have opted for different furniture to match the vibe that they're trying to create but this review is based on food and service only."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, great tequila selection with a couple core mezcal options, and quality food. You can see the kitchen and chef at work also, which is a bonus compared to traditional Mexican joints. Make sure to ask about happy hour and margarita Monday"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, loved the mango guacamole! Bomb shrimp tacos. Loved the Cadillac margarita! Good food, and quick service you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Beautiful space with original art, amazing cocktails and delicious food made with high quality ingredients. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"There is a burgeoning food scene outside the strip where the prices are way more reasonable and the quality is greater. This new place is a perfect example. The pork belly is an amazing deal for $17 (you get 2 steaks which could feed two ppl). Homemade salsa with a good tequila selection. The staff is incredibly nice and makes the experience all about you. The location doesn't seem great, but looks are deceiving. Give this place a shot. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the food here. Bernie (our waiter) was spectacular and kept us entertained the whole evening. Pork Belly Chicharoni was unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and awesome service! A hit on Father's Day only problem was the amount of food we ordered ;) will for sure come back.
Tostadas de la casa y ceviche de la casa are excellent appetizers and all the tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot! They have an amazing happy hour, and awesome drinks. The food was incredible we got the jalepeno mac and cheese, street corn, nachos, and the churro waffle for desert and finished it all! I will for sure be coming back !"}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant. Small gem! My husband and I struggle to find places that we both like to eat bc I'm vegan and he most definitely is not. This place answers that problem. My husband loved the street tacos and margarita. I loved their vegan beet salad and vegan Chile rellenos. (Definitely had leftovers, but couldn't resist ordering both)

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here for the first time; and was immensely impressed w/ the delicate flavors of the food. I ordered the salmon salad & found the dressing to be exquisitely tasty. My husband ordered the trio taco special w/ the following meats:
Chicken, Asada, and pork belly, which were all delicious w/ the enhancement of pickled onions. The rice & beans that came with the trio were perfectly seasoned - not overly salty nor greasy. 

We are looking forward to returning for dinner, so we can try the lobster enchilada (YUM!)."}
{"text":"Had three tacos, octopus, mahi mahi, and pork belly all in blue corn tortillas. The octopus was oh so tender. And the pork belly like butter, so wrong, I don't wanna be right. 

The margaritas are delicious, had the watermelon ginger, it comes with a slice of watermelon. It's a nice little treat it absorbs the tequila so you bite into it and woooo yummm."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must!! It is located on Sahara and Cimarron in the EOS Fitness shopping center. We have been seeing posts on Facebook for the past few months about this restaurant so we decided to try it. The pictures that are posted don't do the food justice. This is not your typical Mexican  food restaurant!  I had an excellent beef fajita salad that was filled with beef, bell peppers and onions, black beans and cheese. My husband had three item combination that he said it was fabulous too. His combination had a Barbacoa enchilada, a huge chili relllano and a shrimp sopa. The food is extremely fresh and offers more regional, authentic flavor than your typical Mexican food restaurant. We will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Salud never disappoints. The chef, the bartender, the hostess - the entire staff is always super friendly and helpful. Plus, the food is amazing. Today we had a delicious lunch of queso fundido, stuffed jalape√±os, carne asada tacos, a veggie wrap, and posole soup. Our waitress, a young woman named Z, was gregarious and familiar with the menu and the ingredients we asked about when trying to make our selections."}
{"text":"What a great new spot for Mexican food. When we were seated our waiter was busy with a party of 8, The bar manager Ashley saw that we had been waiting a minute she  brought us our chips and salsa and took our margarita order, the margarita's are a very nice size.  They also have a very special salsa there made with Olive oil...  it is  addicting, so different very good!  The food was very flavorful not your run of the mill mexican food you can tell that the chef puts effort into his food.  Now for the service our waiter was very friendly, very nice, very attentive.  When the check came we were told the bar manager bought our margaritas she didn't have to do that... what it tells me is that this restaurant appreciates its customer and puts the customer 1st! Very Classy!! Very impressed. Highly recommend!! Can't wait to bring friends and family to the new spot."}
{"text":"This place is freakin amazing! The food is delicious and the service is excellent. Our waiter Bernie was awesome! He suggested the Pork Belly Chicharron and wow! One of the best Mexican dishes I've ever had in my life. The meat was extremely tender and flavorful. The tacos were also some of the best I've had. They even have an all you can drink margarita special on Monday nights!! I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Attention EVERYONE!!!! Salud is AMAAAAAZING! Listen, I'm not usually a fan of Mexican food, but I have now come back 4 times and each time, my tastebuds are blown away. 
I highly recommend the mushroom tacos. Good LAWD, I crave Salud's mushroom tacos with my entire being. And OOOH the churro waffles a la mode. 
You need Salud. 
In your mouth. 
Like, yesterday. 
Such a hidden gem in the City of Sin!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying these guys out and I loveeeee them! Great atmosphere/decor, music wasn't too loud and the prices were great! AYCE tacos and margaritas on Mondays 4-8pm for 22$. AMAZING vegan tacos! I couldn't get enough of the hibiscus tacos! Hubby loved the carne asada and pork belly tacos! The margaritas are fantastic and plentiful. Ashley, the restaurant manager, was so friendly and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good , would I go again probably not !! This restaurant is lucky I'm giving them 2 stars . The service was not good period ..I was with a group of 15 . Margaritas were sent back twice , orders were wrong , server could not remember who ordered what. One of my friends got salsa on them from the kitchen. A couple people waited almost 35 minutes for there food . The server even asked one of the guest what his order was 2 times after he took his order . My husband order was wrong and just overall service was horrible. We had to even ask to get refills on our drinks . Cleanup bus lady was even pushy . . We probably won't return and it was my husband and I first time there."}
{"text":"Went to Salud for the first time Saturday. The staff was amazing - Bernie our waiter especially, and the food was delicious. Everything was homemade including the chips and salsas, the Spanish rice was wonderful and the Chile relleno was the best I have ever had. Drinks were made with fresh ingredients and you can definitely taste the difference. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!
Great Service, Great Drinks, Great Food.
Our server Ashley was super nice, explained the menu to us first timers.
The Octopus Appetizer was Banging!!!
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A Mexican restaurant adjacent to my gym only spells trouble but somehow I've only popped in a couple of times. Their daily HH runs 4-6:30, with food and drink specials, and usually overlaps with my workouts. I park on the other side of the building to avoid the temptation. I've been in a couple of times and tried a considerable portion of the menu with friends. Service alternately attentive and friendly or the exact opposite. Note that they have discontinued their weekend brunch.

HITS: 
+ Their table salsas. One roasted, one green, and one with a vaguely Asian flavor with sesame and tamarind? Could not stop eating them.
+ Guacamole del Mar with crab, parmesan, and roasted garlic: The seafood and dairy add some interesting notes to the classic guac without overpowering it. Nice for something different.
+ Octopus Salteado: This was barely a hit. The portion was good for the price and I mostly liked the sauce but the amount was overwhelming. Presentation is messy and unappealing, you won't win over any people who don't already love octopus. 
+ Crab & Shrimp Relleno: Huge portion, definitely a dish to share. Sauce was good, pepper was huge, ample filling, and went well the cilantro rice. Despite being a seafood dish, this was very heavy.
+ Duck Carnitas: Very good! Nicely crispy, paired well with the berry jalapeno chutney, would get again but wish they made their tortillas in house.

MISSES: 
- Queso Fundido: wasn't stringy, didn't pull, was alternately watery and clumpy, wasn't quite executed right, maybe not hot enough?
- Campechana Ceviche: Classic Mexican seafood cocktail, but inconsistent across two visits with drastically different tastes. Seafood was fresh, though.
- Gnocchi Mexicano: A vegetarian pasta dish at Mexican restaurant? It didn't work. Again, super heavy with a portion size fit for a family. I liked the guajillo-mushroom cream sauce but it was very heavy and the pasta was gummy and the dish vaguely unbalanced. 

UNDECIDED: the fact that this is even a category is why my rating sits at a solidly average three stars for \"A-OK\"
? Lobster & Chorizo Empanadas: Interesting. Didn't taste distinctly of lobster or chorizo. Seemed overpriced ($15) for the portion. Liked the pastry though.
? Surf & Turf Pizza: crust was way too thick and the (admittedly plentiful) toppings didn't harmonize.
? Ceviche de la Casa: fresh but notably smaller portion than other ceviches despite lower quality ingredients, and flavors were not well distributed."}
{"text":"I feel like this place is a secret that needs to be told. The salsas that come with the complementary chips are unique and delicious. The house margaritas are pretty good, and they have a collection of other mixologist-created cocktails. My boyfriend had birria tacos that could melt in your mouth. They also have pretty great specials. Happy hour is from 4-6:30, and you can get $5 margaritas and appetizers. On Mondays, they have all-you-can-eat tacos and margaritas for $22!"}
{"text":"Been here for the first time & my waitress is very sweet. Enjoyed her service. Although, the burrito was a bit too spicy (enchilada sauce) wish I was more aware before spending my money because I couldn't even finish more than half. But the service was great."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!!!! I was pleasantly surprised.  I read the previous reviews and was intrigued.  

We went on a Wednesday night...around 7:45pm. It wasn't busy.  We fell in love with the simple, elegant decor.  My husband commented that he felt under dressed...LOL.  Very, very pretty interior.  

Our waiter Bernie was fantastic!! He greeted us with a huge smile and took the time to offer suggestions and explain the menu.  He was also very warm and friendly.  His timing was also spot on. 

The food....OMG!!! The pork belly chicharron is a must. The flavor is beyond amazing and nothing like anything we've ever tried.

Pollo sarandeado was also a delicious choice.  Great flavor!! Would order again, but we enjoyed the chicharron better.  

Our daughter really enjoyed her carne asada fries...the best we've ever had. 

This is our new favorite. Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place. There are not many modern mexican restaurants in town, and so we love coming here and trying out all the tasty food. Great prices and everything we have ever tried here tastes amazing! Only wish it was open later."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Mexican food I have ever had! Amazing chips and salsas, margaritas, octopus and tres leches flan all absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"100 percent will be here every week. Great portions and amazing flavors. The munchies appetizer was so much more than we thought... could have been our dinner. Chicharron was by far the best. Coming back next Monday for tacos and margaritas."}
{"text":"Tried this place as its right down the road from me. My friends and I are really into brunching so I thought I would go and check it out for brunch (and bring the friends back later). I got the Chile Verde Omelet with breakfast potatoes and charro beans. It was amazing!!! Large portion too. I also had the complimentary chips and salsa and the Wake the dead coffee (boozy Mexican coffee). Both were very good. I will definitely come back!!! I want to try the apple cider mimosa next time and the steak diablo. Ashley the bar manager gave great service!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and extremely flavorful food!  The experience was a 10/10 from the start.  The flight of salsas served with the chips at the beginning of our meal was a delicious way to sample three fantastic salsas.  Our party of 8 ordered the fajitas, street tacos, jalape√±o Mac n cheese, Barbacoa enchiladas, ceviche and chimichanga.  All were highly praised!  Portions are generous and you can taste fresh, high quality ingredients.  A special shout out to Marcie!  She took excellent care of us and helped us celebrate a birthday at the end of our meal with a trio of desserts that was to die for!  You won't be disappointed.  We're so glad Juan's Flaming Fajitas had a 2 hour wait and we found Salud!"}
{"text":"Salud Mexican Bistro is absolutely amazing. Everything from the service to the food was fantastic. Even though I live in San Diego, this is the best Mexican food I've ever eaten. Bernie was our waiter, and his positive attitude made us feel so welcomed. Other staff members were incredibly attentive and always made sure we had enough water, chips, and salsa. They serve 3 types of salsa and the chile one is seasoned very well. We ordered the lamb and mushroom tacos and lobster chorizo empanadas. YUM. The empanadas come with salad and are big enough to be a meal in itself. They do a wonderful job balancing and combining flavors. Next time I'm in town, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worth  it's 4.5 stars.  
Food is great. Great flavors. 
Service was great 
Clean sleek place. 
Got the pork belly- big, bold flavors. 
My son liked his steak quesadilla 
Asado fries- yum 
Curros waffle - sweet and delicious 
Octopus is soft and juicy."}
{"text":"I never do a Yelp review unless it's well deserved... Vibe, food, and decor are all wonderful! Food is delicious... come in for music bingo, so much fun!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, ceviche, duck confit, quinoa relleno. 

Traditional margarita was the best, well balanced"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's only been open for 5 months and the service and food is absolutely amazing! I'm Latina and I absolutely fell in love with the margaritas and food and I'm picky when it comes to Hispanic food and margaritas for sure!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple, this place is a hidden gem in Las Vegas... Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had... Plus the staff is great... I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and amazing service!  My mom took me here for dinner during my recent trip back home and I quickly understood why it's one of her favorites!!!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place is a solid 5 stars! Their food is amazing and customer service is even better. We would definitely come back again and again. Their sauces are all made in house and they're to die for."}
{"text":"Was just visiting the town , one of my friend told me let's go try since they are in 14 best restaurants in Vegas . Well .. paid of big time . Delicious food , and timely .. even the owner comes and ask how was everything and if we have any criticism he would like to hear to better themselves . I can tell you . This is authentic delicious taste I was looking for a long time . Thank you for the great service !!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant great people great food but they need to get organized 
To much help just doing nothing while customers are not being taken care of slow or busy no excuse to not take care of your customers 
Keep in mine without customers you will not be in business 
Customer service is so important and I think they lack this 
Customer service starts with management and it seems they lack experience management 
Hopefully they can get it together"}
{"text":"What a lovely surprise tucked away in a strip mall! Great service, warm welcome and delicious food! I think I found my summer drink-Watermelon Gi Gee margarita!!!!!! Yummy! Found out they also do $22 AYCE and Drink in Monday's- tacos and margaritas! Looks like a future girls night!!!
Look forward to coming back and making this a mainstay!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. $22 for unlimited margaritas and street tacos. You get a choice of 6 different street tacos for this \"margarita Monday deal\". The bartenders were amazing, my glass was always full. The tacos were great (and I'm from Southern California so I'm picky when it comes to Mexican food). Definitely would recommend to anyone! Regular menu looks good too, can't wait to try it next time."}
{"text":"Salud is AWESOME!!!  Food is outstanding!  The Octopus appetizer was sooo tender.  Bernie was a great server and made some excellent recommendations.  Come give this place a try.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos, all the ingredients are fresh and bold.  Drinks made with real fruit and juice.  Beautiful and fun inside, great service"}
{"text":"After a long day, I was in no mood to cook or even drive to pick up something. Fortunately, I took advantage of Doordash free promotion to get delivery from here.

Great Mexican food is hard to come by after living in San Diego. It is like going to the NFL and then being sent to a high school team, lol.

But this place had rave reviews, so I took a chance and ordered the street tacos and carne asada fries.

The delivery was very fast and only took 20 minutes. First off, they included some free chips and salsa, which is a nice touch. 

I dug into the street tacos, which were a mix of carne asada, pork, chicken, and a few other meats. All pretty good. The carne asada fries were also pretty good, and the portion sizes were generous for both.

While it isn't up to San Diego level, it is a good rendition and I would order from here again."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  All the food was amazing.  Octopus tacos were my favorite.  El pastor and pollo were also very tasty.  My friend tried the Mexican gnocchi and loved it.  Spectacular tequila selection.  We will definitely be a back!"}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and was not disappointed! They also have a song bingo game on Thursday nights, I believe. It's pretty fun, and you can win free drinks! I had the Street Tacos (one of each kind), Nachos and Grilled Mexican Corn. All of the tacos were good, but I think I liked the pork belly the best, then chicken next, then the beef. The nachos were too salty for me, so I couldn't finish them. I think one of the sauces on top added to the salt already on the chips. The corn was great! The service at our table was a bit spotty. Everyone was nice, but orders took a bit of time and some orders were either incorrect or did not come at all. Service at the bar was great! Everyone was very nice and courteous. The bar staff introduced themselves with a handshake, which I thought was a nice touch. Bernie is a riot, and Ashley is just awesome! She mixes a great Margarita and Aztec Sunset."}
{"text":"Went with a friend for dinner and drinks. The food was very tasty (combination chili relano and chicken burrito) and the drinks were just as good,,,,Watermelon and Cucumber margaritas delish on both! We sat in the bar area, which was busy but as soon as the bartender was free we received exceptional service. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. I am not a big Mexican food fan but I love this place. The food is authentic and fresh. Love the surf and turf Pizza with huge chunks of Lobster. The Prime tip sirloin is my wife's favorite. For a quick bit the street tacos are awesome. Service is top notch here, especially Ashley. I can't drink but have heard she makes great margaritas. Try this place you sill  not be sorry."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Hello?!! Where has this place been? My boyfriend LOVES Mexican food but I've always been meh about it. I NEVER pick Mexican food for an option ever!!! Well he surprised me here with dinner tonight and holy moly this is the BEST place I've been to in a while! We had the the octopus  appetizer and it was amazing. Every other place I've ordered octopus at (and I order octopus everytime it's available) it's chewy and overlooked and bland. This was by far the BEST soft flavorful octopus I've ever had. Hands down a must order. And then let me tell you, I've always thought ceviche was not a big deal until tonight. Their shrimp ceviche tastes so fresh and crisp I mean wow. We also ordered the street tacos (2 pork belly, 2 lamb, and one carne asada). Super bomb! Is usually hate tacos but these were so good! The lamb is a must get!!! For dessert we got the flan and I think I ate all of it. Super satisfying! This place is insanely good and this is the only place I'll be going to for Mexican food. Our server BERNIE was kick ass!!! What an awesome guy! He made this dinner super memorable and else will for sure be coming back and requesting him!! You HAVE to try this place! Ask for Bernie!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better staff!! Definitely try the pork belly the sauce is to die for ! Tacos are amazing as well. Will for sure be my new regular spot for Mexican!"}
{"text":"Coconut Shrimp Tacos! I haven't been able to have coconut shrimp in 6 loooong years! I can't have sugar and most places rely on sugar for flavor. Salud relies on the flavor of their quality ingredients! The natural sweetness of the coconut, corn breading and fresh shrimp. Amazing ingredients make all the difference! I'm in heaven right now Doesn't hurt that the service is stellar too! Bernie was our waiter and I couldn't even tell you the last time, if ever, that a waiter was so personable and took such good care of us that we felt like they were invested in our meal experience on a personal level. Unbelievably fantastic! When even the bus girl is worthy of mention (Martha packed up our food meticulously) you know you've found a new favorite spot! Say hello from me if you treat yourself to a meal here!"}
{"text":"The 5 tacos were so good but getting the guacamole app. Really filled me up. So I would not do that next time. 
The guac didn't have much taste,  I prefer more salt  (which was not at the table) and more lime and cilantro. 
The three salsa tastings at the beginning were all very good.  Try them all!
I got carne asada tacos.  The only thing I'd say is I didn't care for the heavy season on the beef. I'd rather the meat just have a simple flavor.  It made it seem more like the taco seasoning you use when making tacos at home. 
My daughter enjoyed her burrito."}
{"text":"can't say enough positive things about Salud. the food is amazing. the people are always happy. the owners are young and vibrant.

become a regular and you may get your own engraved shot glass!!!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I got a gnocchi with mushroom sauce that was very yummy and the street tacos were average. My margarita was good as well. I know its an upscale place but for the prices I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"First time here a few days ago and what a great experience!! Staff and food were amazing! The Mexican street corn omg I'm drooling talking about it haha Also Michelle you were awesome! I definitely recommend coming here if you want some authentic Mexican food and great drinks as well!!"}
{"text":"E?S FITNESS MEMBERS GET 10% OFF
Vegetarian & Vegan options too!

We played hooky... walked straight passed E?S, into Salud and I'm glad we did.
We weren't hungry, my pitch was tequila based. So we sat at the bar.

1 Roger Rabbit Margarita 
1 Watermelon Ginger 
1 Classic Guacamole 

So I'm pretty convinced they put crack in the guac. It also comes with a salsa trio, the star of the dish being just that.

The restaurant it's self was clean, decorated beautifully and stocked with ingredients you would find at a craft bar. Everything is fresh and of high quality. We can't wait to come back and enjoy the full menu!"}
{"text":"Better than the strip!!!
Stopped in for lunch and ordered 3 street tacos had the chili verde, lamb and pasture and all were great and tasty well seasoned but adding the salsas was even better !
Salsas all great and fresh! Cannot wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place on a Groupon. It's brand new and they're promoting it. It's small but stylish. Fun music. I had the quinoa and mushroom chile relleno. It was fantastic. Spicy and creamy. The mushroom sauce w/tequila had a nice tangy flavor w/chunks of corn and peppers. My bf had the carne asada burrito. It was very fresh and topped with a creamy sauce and fresh cilantro. Both came w/beans. Would definitely eat here again, or just stop by the bar for drinks. They have an extensive tequila/mezcal selection, & specialty drinks. The only reason I'm not giving it 5  is I feel like we haven't tried enough of the dishes. Also, I wish that it came w/some rice, instead of just beans."}
{"text":"Jalape√±o mac and cheese & Street tacos were delicious! Wasn't expecting to be that impressed.  Def come for happy hour :)"}
{"text":"I came in here with some friends during there happy hour! This place is located in a shopping center with a lot of signs pointing it out! We came in and sat at the bar and ordered drinks and appetizers. They serve chapulines which are fried crickets. We didn't order them but that's for any daring people out there. The restaurant is really pretty and colorful. We started with a watermelon ginger margarita the Serrano margarita and the Roger rabbit margarita. All of the margaritas were great but I will warn you the Serrano margarita has a kick to it. My favorite was the watermelon  margarita. It comes with a fresh watermelon slice. We also ordered the corn and 3 tacos one of each pork belly carne asada and chicken. The corn was cut into 3! So CONVENIENT . The tacos were really good too they came on black tortillas. Will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"Excellent! Delicious food, clean space and the servers are very knowledgeable and kind! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Second time there and no complains!! The food is really goooood!!  The server, the music ! 
We sat in the bar, the bartender Marcy was 
Really friendly  she was smiling, singing, dancing  all the time! And the Bingo  music  too much fun!!"}
{"text":"Great food friendly staff. What else can you ask for. One of the best Mexican spots in town. It's a small place and is family owned and you can tell. There is love in the food and the service from the the waitresses."}
{"text":"Excellent all around. Very nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Bar is nice and appears well stocked with tequilas.  All the food was very good. Must get the posole!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite new restaurant!  My husband and I visited last week and were thrilled with the original, unique and delicious dishes on the menu!  We tried the pollo Sarandeodo and the duck carnitas (a difficult dish to do correctly), and loved both of them!  The location is in the old Rosemary's location on west Charleston. The bar, drink menu and decor is equally awesome.  Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is by far the fanciest Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. The food is amazing, drinks are delicious, the service was great, and the interior is beautiful. This restaurant is definitely a date night worthy place to go to instead of Chevy's for example. I recommend."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour. The jalapeno Mac and cheese was amazing. We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim around 9:30pm. I felt bad with it being close to closing time, but the staff was attentive and friendly! The food was very good: love their salsas and the gnocchi is very tasty! I also has some of the pork belly tamale and cheese chile relleno... I'll ask for light green sauce next time as it was too spicy for me, but was very flavorful! My dish also came with a big bowl of pozole! Super good, and a lot of food!!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour...deee-licious house margaritas and bar specials. The staff couldn't have been more gracious or attentive.  Easy to give this place five stars and a big thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. The food was wonderful. It was like a modern take on Mexican cuisine. The make everything from scratch even the cocktails. Service was as wonderful and the waitress was very knowledgeable about what they offer. I will definitely be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh food and delicious drinks! The chile relleno is the best ever with a light and crispy cornmeal batter. Queso fundido = heaven! Bartender Michelle is so sweet and made awesome drinks. Met the owner Andreas and he is super friendly, too. Highly highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after reading a review in the LVRJ and some good reviews on Yelp. It's a new restaurant that's been open for just a few months. The restaurant is very nice and the staff is fantastic. They have a great selection of cocktails including many varieties of Margaritas. The menu has a lot of variations and options as well. Ordered the stuffed Jalape√±os which were fantastic. Ordered the Barbacoa enchilada and Chile Relleno. My wife ordered the coconut shrimp tacos. Everything was delectable. The food  is prepared with quality ingredients and everything was fantastic. We will be going back to Salud often."}
{"text":"I came here for an early dinner yesterday i.e. Saturday around 5 PM, so understandably, it wasn't crowded at all. 

I love the bar area and the dining area had a nice atmosphere and a cool mural. My bf and I had our choice of tables and sat the booth. 

We saw a few dishes we like on the bar and drink menu so we tried to order, the  waitress said only available at the bar. We wondered why were we given that menu. We requested her to make an exception so she went and ask her manager. They were were kind enough to let us order from bar menu.

The complimentary chips and salsa with 3 salsas came to the table. The chips were crunchy and not oily and my fave sauce was Macho.

We ordered the Octopus Salteado, came out very fresh, and the sauces on it were flavorful. That was our favorite dish.

Chicken wings was ok and Pork Belly slider needs some sauce on it, it was not pork belly and was bland. 

Churro waffle with icecream dessert was huge and sweet..I was sugar high!

The waitress was very friendly and attentive. 

The owner, I believe, came by and asked about our opinion of this new restaurant and we gave him our thoughts."}
{"text":"Really great food!  I loved the family feel here, and the food was incredible.   Had the gnocchi, and was surprised at the quality and the price!  I'll probably eat here a lot more!  Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"It was our first time here and let me just say, this could have been an awful experience and started out that way. Ashley was AMAZING and completely turned our experience around. The food was fresh, the margaritas were strong, and the service was great. We will be coming back thanks to Ashley!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Jalape√±o Mac & Cheese was delicious! Service was excellent.  Thank You Marcy"}
{"text":"Yummy Mexican food! This place is true and authentic cuisine and serves only fresh ingredients. Not greasy or artificial at all. I love their happy hour menu. Their tacos are really flavorful and their drinks are good as well. Always coming back"}
{"text":"Way over priced for what you get.  $8 for a glass of ice that they call a margarita.  2 sips and it's gone.  The waitress took our order several times because she doesn't write anything down, forgets what we ordered, and forgets to place the orders, and moved at glacial speeds.  The food itself isn't anything special.  I really don't see why they have such good ratings, which we relied on in selecting Salud."}
{"text":"This store is not your typical \"rice and beans\" Mexican restaurant. Their entree's are \"upscale\" with \"upscale\" prices to go with them. I had their Bone-in Short Rib and it was delicious. However, at $28 the \"value to money\" for this entree did not work for me. It's a smaller dining venue whose design is clean and simple. Everyone in our party enjoyed their food and the margaritas were delicious as well. Point of interest, parking can be a challenge as they share their parking lot with EOS Fitness, Krazy Buffet and Marie Callender's."}
{"text":"Awesome menu, great margarita 'a, a must go for authentic Mexican fare! Bernie was the Best!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The octopus appetizer was the best I have had in town and the margaritas are so fresh and delicious I can't wait to go back and have more. The staff was prompt in serving us they were happy helpful and concerned if everything we had was good. Overall experience was fantastic. Try the watermelon margarita!"}
{"text":"I ran across this place they Facebook and my husband and i decided to give it a shot. We dined in and we had their pozole which was bomb for just $6 bucks also their flautas were bomb. After our meal we went to the bar where Ashley was just amazing she educated us in a lot of tequila. Then the owners Stevee and Andres introduce themselves and they were super friendly and fun, hands down everything about this establishment is amazing.. definitely will be coming back"}
{"text":"The MOST DELICIOUS FOOD AND SERVICE I'VE EXPERIENCED in the SUMMERLIN area in EONS!!!
So FLAVORFUL!  First off, each table is started off and dare I'd say treated to 3 delicious salsas served with a mixture of double colored, crispy, perfectly salted chips!  My table was delightfully serviced by Marcie, and I truly wish she was employed by every restaurant in which I dine!  Attentive, sincere, happy, caring, exactly the right amount of attention to our table, perky, attractive, personable.  In addition, Marcie had a hard working assistant, Martha, who absolutely enhanced our evening by providing that perfect touch of \"extras!\"  
   The FOOD!  Oh. My. Goodness!  To express that it was \"MEXICAN ELEVATED\" does not begin to touch the quality, essence, the flavor, or the perfect notes that hit our palettes!  My dining partner chose the Duck~ and, was a n fowl Heaven!  No oily duck in this restaurant!  I went traditional and chose the 3 cheese poblano chili relleno and chicken enchilada-absolute perfection!  And, the margaritas are to die for!  Choose any one off their extension menu and you will be transported to Mexico!  Go To Salud NOW!"}
{"text":"I tried this new Mexican restaurant not too far from where I live.  I went in about 5 PM and there was no one in the place except for one person waiting for take out.  

I ordered a campechana ceviche to start, duck carnitas for my entr√©e, and flan for dessert.  The campechana consisted of shrimp, mussels, octopus, crab, and avocado with an ancho chipotle sauce.  It was outstanding.  A good amount of seafood with a spicy sauce to work with the citrus.

The duck carnitas were good but the duck was a bit dry.  Having three kinds of salsa helped.  The dish was something quite different for a Mexican restaurant.

Dessert of orange flavored flan was another outstanding dish.  The beginning and end of the meal were the best parts.

My server was Ashley and she was very helpful with questions I had and with always keeping my iced tea filled.

3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Most amazing mexican carne asada fries EVER!
When I first walked in for a friends birthday party I was greeted with warm smiles and gentle eyes. Since I have never been to this location before
They where happy to explain the menu to me; when the staff sat us down near the bar? she took our orders then we got to talking and I love when businesses take the time out to say hello to there customers. I felt like they where family right away as if I just came to a backyard BBQ. But the restaurants looks nothing like a backyard lol
It is very settling on the eyes but decorated beautifully with a spin of fun. When our food came out I tasted the fries and I could not believe how delicious they where. And let me tell you I always order this off any menu when going to restaurants. But WOW they have some amazing dishes I even tried my best friends gnocchi mexicano and could not believe how tasty it was and I don't do mushrooms ever. So if you are looking for a great place to bring family, friends, coworkers and bosses this is the best place to be. I will be coming here more often! When my friends come in from out of state they will get to try this place. 
Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice to finally have a good mexican restaurant right down the street from my house! 

The pre-meal chips and salsa are delicious, each of the 3 salsas have true authentic mexican flavors. My only complaint would be to make the chips a little bigger, it was hard to scoop all the salsa-y goodness onto the very small chips they provide.

Guacamole portion is huge and super yummy, nice to see they aren't skimpy on the avocados. Chipotle should take some notes....

I've ordered the tacos al pastor twice now and each time they have not disappointed, pork isn't fatty and pineapple is perfectly grilled.  My boo thangggg ordered the chicken fajitas and they were fantastic! Both entrees were accompanied by mexican rice and refried beans.

I say Salud to Salud!"}
{"text":"The food here is better than many Mexican restaurants. Interesting, varied menu. Prices are reasonable. The staff are very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This is one of my top picks for Mexican Bistros. The octopus salteado is tender and amazing. The duck carnitas with berry jalape√±o chutney is also amazing. And don't miss the chips served with three sauces (the garlic infused oil with roasted chilies is my favorite. My advice is skip the typical dishes and enjoy the adventure. Oh, and don't miss the tres leches flan."}
{"text":"The service and food is exceptional. The triple salsa plate is great and goes well with the tuna ceviche"}
{"text":"NEW FAVORITE MEXICAN RESTAURANT IN VEGAS!!! Really fantastic food and cocktails!! I will definitely be returning.. the salsas they give you are also AMAZING!!!! and unique - not like other Mexican restaurants!"}
{"text":"The service is exceptional. The food Wonderful to the senses. Tequila choices, excellent. Roxanne the bartender is awesome.. Ambience is welcoming to the Hispanic theme. ...All is well"}
{"text":"Where to start... the service? The food? The drinks?

Everything was absolutely amazing. The staff was incredible, the food was somehow better, and the tequila.... no words. 

This experience was unbelievable. They danced with us, laughed with us, even sang happy birthday with us.

10/10 recommend.

I would come back to vegas just for this restaurant."}
{"text":"5 stars for a solid HH.  Can choose from 3 different types of tacos along with great drink deals.  All fresh.  Great vibe and Ashley at the bar and the whole team made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"I was invited to join a friend to check this place out, and I'm So Glad that he did! They have a great twist on Mexican cuisine and so much diversity in their dishes that you will have no problem finding something that will hit your taste buds like nothing before and having you coming back for more! Along with a great selection of supreme tequila's. 
    I found my new FAV !!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! We came for the first time. We were just trying to find a new place to eat for our one year anniversary and the service was exceptional, the drinks were perfect, even trying something new and all-around great place. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"It was a dreary and cold Vegas winter night, and we thought that some Mexican food would warm our tummies, so we headed back to Salud, this time to try some of their signature dishes.

Okay, it was a Saturday night, two families were leaving as we were going in, so why were we the only ones in the dining room? I can't figure it out, given all the great reviews.

Our waiter, Bernie, was the best - attentive, funny, and all-around charming, and we thoroughly enjoyed talking with him and learning about how (oops! I almost spoiled his surprise)...

My traditional margarita came exactly as I asked, without salt and just a little ice, and was appropriately tangy. Good start.

We skipped appetizers because we don't eat a lot and went straight to the main event. I ordered the Pollo Sarandeado, which turned out to be a beautiful dish - a juicy, Frenched chicken breast with an eye-fetching portion of rice, along with a huge, separate side of black beans. I was happy, because I had forgotten to specify that I wanted my beans black, instead of pink, refried, or any other way. I wasn't aware that the sauce was a cream sauce, or I probably wouldn't have ordered that dish - ya know, high fat, yada yada. So I ignored that fact and plunged in, and my taste buds thanked me, even if my waistline, or lack of one, didn't. It was sublimely delicious!

The hubs, the supreme chicken man, went for the Fajita Salad. It was a large portion, much bigger than it appears in my photo. He absolutely adored it. I tried some, too, and boy, do I love those rajas.

Even though we loved the flan we had for dessert last visit, we skipped it this time. Too full.  But there's always a next time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic flavors! If you are looking for \"classic Mexican food\" keep moving; this is Mexican food that takes the classics and elevates them. The cerveza was cold, the salsas were different and delicious and the pollo, arroz, pozole, and frijoles were anything but standard, classic fare. We loved everything about our food/experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First of all, we love the food here. It's awesome, and if you haven't eaten here you should. We've had a lot of different things off the menu and liked them all."}
{"text":"I have been to Salud a couple of times, and it is definitely worth checking out. Good quality modern Mexican cuisine. 
My favorite though are the tacos and if you go on Margarita Mondays for the all you can eat tacos and margaritas you won't be disappointed!
Best part of the \"all you can eat\" you can try all of the tacos to find your favorites! I think mine is the mushroom! Yummy!
I did not care to much for the Queso Fundido, for me, it had way to much chorizo for cheese ratio... 
I love that they have a good variety of vegetarian and vegan options, and those options actually taste good!!"}
{"text":"Today was our first time coming to Salud and I can say that it was an amazing experience! We were greeting by the owner and she was incredibly helpful and engaged with us all throughout our meal. She even took a shot with us! I'm definitely coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Neo-Mexican at its best. This place is not your standard Mexican fare...(ie a menu filled with way too many combinations of your usual dishes).  Everything we ordered was delicious. The sauces and seasonings were the perfect balance of spice and flavor in every dish. The pollo sandadeado, pork belly chicharones, and the tacos were all amazing. The sides which I usually ignore were delicious. The black beans perfectly seasoned, as were the refried beans and the frijoles a la charra which were rich with flavor in a thick sauce. 

The service was on point, not rushed and our waiter was knowledgeable and offered great suggestions. The drink menu offered creative twists such as the Watermelon Ginger which wasn't too sweet and went down easy. 

Having lived in Texas and Northern Mexico I've eaten at my share of \"Mexican\" food and this place is high end flavor without the high end price. I wanted to order one of everything on the well crafted menu. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered food online. It came in a timely manner and was still warm. The empanadas were amazing. The quesadilla was also very good but I wish it had come with the chicken that I ordered. Not a big cheese quesadilla fan but it was fine could have just eaten the empanadas only."}
{"text":"This is hard review to write. Firstly, let me start off by saying the food is good. We enjoyed our authenic tacos. However,( here's where it gets tricky) The bar manager took it upon her self to obviously hit on my husband. It was so uncomfortable for BOTH of us that we will NEVER GO BACK.   I am sure she thought she was being cute and friendly, but that wasn't the case at all.  My husband and I rushed out of there never to return because of her inappropriate behavior.  It's a shame because the service was good and so was the food.  The owner Andres should put her in check before another couple is disresprected by her and they continue to lose business."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and awesome service!  We tried a Taco Monday special and enjoyed it SO much. We've been back a couple more times. I've tried all of their tacos and the portabella mushroom tacos are by far my favorite. Love their blue taco shells. Their prices are fair and the servers are friendly. They also have music trivia nights, live comedy nights, etc. It's a fun place with delicious food."}
{"text":"It's a nice place with very cute design. Great tacos, tasty food and friendly staffs. Everything I have tried there, I have loved so far. Do not hesitate going there."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed. I was looking for Happy Hours here on Yelp and found this treasure! The food was fantastic and the Margaretta's were made with fresh lime and agave syrup. The family-owned staff was wonderful and had the best assortment of tequilas. The unique combination of flavors and food offerings make this place a place to return to often!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a unique experience. The food is absolutely fantastic and the wait staff is very attentive from start to finish. I highly recommend trying the plate of 5 different types of tacos. The el pastor taco was out of this world! The churro waffle was an amazing dessert, which you can't find anywhere else in Vegas. The pictures alone of what I ate had so many friends asking for the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! My husband 3 kids and I ate here we ordered a few different things so we could all try each other's dish. The food was so delicious and full of flavor!!!! Amazing we loved everything we ordered the Carne Asada Fries, Shrimp Ceviche, Asada quesadillas, and street tacos!!!! Soooooo good and what made everything even better which was hard cause everything was so good to begin with was the servers they were knowledgeable,friendly,funny, fast, and efficient. Thank you Bernie, Marcy, Ashley and Ashley amazing service we will definitely be back again and will be telling our friends about this little gem we found!!!"}
{"text":"Salud initially came up on my radar after I read a few positive comments by local reviewer John Curtas.  I was also attracted by the ambitious menu which includes a mix of both traditional dishes and some highly innovative ones.  On entering, I realized the restaurant space was once occupied by Rosemary's - sigh.  We had made Opentable reservations for a Saturday evening which proved to be unnecessary as the restaurant was only about 1/2 full, the bar less so.  A trio of what I believe were house made salsas accompanied by a bowl of taco chips were brought to the table while we reviewed the menu.  My wife chose the Pacific halibut with pineapple mango tequila sauce that included both black beans and cilantro rice.  The sauce nearly overwhelmed plate perhaps in recognition of the halibut being very dry due to overcooking.  I gravitated to the bone-in short rib with quajillo chipolte mole that was topped with crispy onions and accompanied by charro beans and roasted corn.  The biggest problem was the short-rib was unusually stringy and dry, once again requiring massive amounts of sauce to make it more palatable.  Given the upscale pricing, we were not overly impressed.  On a more positive note, the service throughout was very good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I was a little scared bc we went on a week day and this place was a ghost town... 

Service was spectacular. The server and runner were so attentive and helpful! They were great with my kids (we took all three of them-and if you have kids you know how this could easily become a nightmare). They made special kid plates that weren't even on the menu!!!

The food was Devine!!! We had pork belly, tacos, guacamole & crab and queso. Everything was perfect!!!

Extra bonus is this place is in the old rosemary's restaurant spot."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch and this place was really an amazing Yelp find. My favorite part of Mexican restaurants is salsa... these guys brought a flight of salsa-3 types all very tasty. Everything on the menu looked amazing and what we ordered was great: tacos and tostadas. They have something for everyone and I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very nice waiter. Not the friendliest hostess(older lady). Seemed a little snooty. The busser girl was very nice and friendly. The octopus appetizer was delicious. The complimentary chips and salsa was not very good and the chips looked like the bottom of the bag crumbs. The tacos are lack luster and the street tacos were dry, salty, and not like any street tacos I've ever enjoyed before. The pork belly entree was okay, but not great. The sides were also lack luster."}
{"text":"Yes! I'm so happy that there's a place literally by my house with some legit street tacos.  My all time favorite here is the Al Pastor, similarly to El Gordo it comes with pineapple.  I also ordered the tuna carpaccio and the guac roasted garlic and crab.  Both of those dishes were really good except the tuna carpaccio is more on the smaller side and not really an entree portion.


They give you complimentary chips and salsa and the Macho sauce (the darkest one) is the best.  It has a smiley flavor and made out of helio peppers.

For my drink I got the watermelon ginger margarita, I love watermelon & ginger beer so the excitement was real when I saw this on the menu.

Last but not least, what's a good new restaurant without amazing service?!  Everyone was friendly and the owner came up to us and ask for feedback.  I'm probably going to be coming here often since my boyfriend is now in love with their pork belly tacos :D"}
{"text":"Save Your Money De Taco Is Much Better This Place Is A Joke With The Waiters Putting His Hands On You Pure BS Food Was Flavorless Rubbery Steak Not What I Thought I Had Ordered $46 Dollars Later"}
{"text":"Salud is located in a strip mall near my gym.  I was excited to see this place was going to open since my family and I love to eat Mexican food.  We were shocked at the prices.  They are very expensive and the food is not gourmet.  Two item combos are $16 and three items are $18. There are only 5 choices on combinations - chile relleno, chicken enchilada, barbacoa enchilada, pork belly tamale and shrimp sope. Three tacos are $14 and burritos are $14. Service was ok, the food didn't have a lot of taste. Soup of the day was $7. The prices are as high or higher than the \"fine\" Mexican restaurants located at the more upscale casinos. I think they will succeed if they drastically lower their prices. It is as if they are trying to do upscale in a strip mall, in an area that has a clientele that consists of mostly local families."}
{"text":"I don't eat Mexican food very often but this place has me coming back atleast every other week for lunch. I always end up getting the carne asada wrap with Chile lime seasoned fries and I always end up with leftovers. The serving size here is legit and the staff is hella friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Z took care of us yet again! Thanks Z! The cocktails here are bomb. The ambience is inviting and relaxing. The food is so good that we came back again. The pork belly is my boyfriends favorite. I have tried some of the tacos and the lobster empanadas. I was never disappointed. I really don't feel like there is a bad thing on their menu. Looking forward to going back for more!"}
{"text":"The decor is spirited.  The seating is well spaced out so there is plenty of room to move around.  I was there with a party of three for lunchtime.  The staff was courteous and efficient.  My friends ordered a watermelon margherita and finished it to the last drop!  Chips and a flight of three different salsas were brought to the table.  The salsa verde was my favorite.  It tasted even better than typical salsa verde that's served at other Mexican restaurants that I frequent (a secret recipe maybe?!).  I ordered the octopus Salteado appetizer.  It was DELICiOUS!  The best octopus appetizer I've eaten in decades; not exaggerating.  The octopus was cooked perfectly with a sauce that tasted both buttery yet seemed to have mustard seed as an ingredient which gave it a \"fun\" texture.  According to the menu the dish is described 'asromesco lime sauce/smoked pepper/creme fraiche'.  Which equates to octopus nirvana for me!  My friend ordered tacos and complimented how good they tasted.  They looked very appealing but my attentions were on eating my octopus.  I also ordered a combination plate that included a cheese chile relleno, beef enchilada, beans & rice.  The enchilada tasted like a unique recipe and quite delicious.  Beans and rice were also very tasty.  The chile relleno was not the typical egg batter variety.  It had a crunchy shell and the cheese used was rather rich tasting.  After a few bites I decided to stop eating it, as the rich flavor was a little too much for my palate.  We were too full for desert.  I will definitely be dining here again, ordering the octopus and then might just go for desert right after that!  Oh the octopus was good!"}
{"text":"Today we came for a friends bday. The food was amazing and the owners are so sweet and humble. They made sure we all had a wonderful time. The food portion were huge and delicious! I Definitely recommend this place for any memorable events. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Their lobster and chorizo empe√±adas are AMAZING! And their tacos are loaded, filing and delicioso! I highly recommend the food and the margaritas here!"}
{"text":"Had the best Chile Verde burrito ever!  The Cadillac margaritas 
were excellent.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. First and foremost, the service was great! Sat at the bar. The bartender, Ashley, was very attentive and knew her tequilas. I had the pozole and the pork belly. Pozole had great flavor and the pork belly, although sweeter than expected, was very good. Price points are good too. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant. I've been here twice for happy hour and have really enjoyed the food and drinks! They have 180 types of tequila so if you know any tequila lovers..this is definitely a place worth taking them to! The staff is also friendly and welcoming. Ashley is the bartender and manager and is so knowledgeable about tequilas!! She'll point you to the perfect one to try!!

Absolutely worth a visit. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Finally an INCREDIBLE Mexican Restaurant on the west side !! Literally eat there 3 times a week since they opened. Here is a list of the must try items

Guacamole is the best I've ever had. So refreshing and delicious 

Street Taco's !!!! Wow !!! The Chile Verde - Coconut Shrimp And Al Pastor are out of this world

The Shrimp Sope is a grand slam. My favorite thing on the menu period. 

The pork tamale is super good. Tamales always seem to be a little dry everywhere else. Not here, and the green salsa makes the difference. 

I could go on and on.... love Salud. Love their staff and officially one of my favorite places in town."}
{"text":"Yum yum! Great food! Went there for the first time , wanted to play bingo but got there late. Nevertheless we sat at the bar and had some drinks and food. The food was delicious!! The staff was super nice. Great place! Definitely will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! I've just had one of the best dishes in my life. I'm was killing time while my car was being worked on and decided to be adventurous. Today I had a bone-in short rib with a guajillo chipotle mole sauce with charro beans and corn on cob on the side. Mole is done at almost every Mexican and Latin restaurant in town and done poorly for the most part. It's often chalky from people using a mix or bitter from too much chocolate. Here the mole sauce has a complex, savory, spicy flavor from a combination of chilis and and a hint of chocolate.

The decor is modern Mexican but not over the top, cool but relaxed. The service is very accommodating, friendly, and eager to please. 

I also ordered a lunch combination plate of a barbacoa taquitos and a three cheese enchiladas which were delicious with fresh ingredients and tasty salsas even though I'm not a taquito fan. The complementary salas and chips had a variety of creative salsas. 
 
I had their house margarita with a spicy twist, the traditional spicy. It was tasty, actually spicy, strong and not overly sweet.j"}
{"text":"The servers were very sweet but I didn't care for the food or the decor. I think they need to tighten things up a little bit. We had a bunch of different waiters stopping by our table asking us if we had ordered already etc, and the music was kind of clubby for a Mexican food restaurant. It would be nice if it had more of a theme in the decorations, music, and even the food - gnocchi seems kind of unconventional for this menu. But I got the feeling they genuinely cared about our experience and the waitstaff was trying hard."}
{"text":"Awesome food experience. Had the Mexican gnocchi and it was really lovely. The queso dip is also a must have for the table.  We also enjoyed the octopus cerviche."}
{"text":"Open for just six months at the former site of Rosemary's it seems Salud! Mexican Bistro and Tequileria has captured a following faster than many, the upscale twist on Mexican cuisine distinctive from what anyone else seems to be doing in Sin City and more-or-less comparable to the Cuisine offered at Candelas on the Bay on Coronado Island.

Toqued by Chef Israel Reyes and owned by a family of Restaurateurs, at least one of them present on-site and checking in with patrons on a regular basis during a visit on Friday, Salud promises \"Food worthy of a fine dining restaurant with a casual atmosphere\" and it is immediately upon entry that the later is confirmed, a Bar stocked with top-shelf Tequila lined by guests watching sports television while the dining room offers a more sedate atmosphere decorated in art made by the Chef and his staff.

Taking a modern approach to Mexican Food but still offering Tacos, Burritos and Guacamole, the former even part of an AYCE option along with Margaritas on Mondays, it was after confirming a reservation that seats were offered at a sturdy wooden four-top in the center of the room, the list of Food and Drink soon distributed by a waitress who proved efficient and pleasant throughout the evening.

Dividing the menu into several sections with prices lower than portions dictate, the sizable kitchen quick to send out complimentary Tortilla Strips flanked by three Salsas including a beautiful Guajillo version that eats like dipping Oil with a robust head of Garlic, it was after a moment's indecision that two Appetizers and three Entrees were selected, a seemingly manageable amount of Food that in reality could have fed at least two others.

Understanding that those seeking \"authentic\" or \"cheap\" Mexican may be turned off by something that at times feels \"fusion-y,\" blistering Queso Fundido studded with Corn like the Koreans nonetheless exemplary with up-front heat and lingering sweetness, it was also in a humongous pile of Carne Asada Fries for just $9 that first impressions of Reyes' cooking were formed, the hand-cut Potatoes crispy and capable of standing up to thick chunks of Beef served with white Cheese and smoky Colorado Sauce.

As usual doing plenty of research on the place before making a reservation, misspellings on the website and a Grub Hub that mirrors neither price nor scope of the offerings evidencing ownership not quite as on-the-ball as they suggest, it was only a few minutes after receiving Appetizers that a loud male server approached to inform the table that Entrees were ready, the first two plates barely half-finished and his suggestion that Food could \"be left under the warmers\" forcibly deemed acceptable as there was simply no room to bring them out.

Feeling rushed even though the Restaurant was less than 1/6 full, the rest of the Fundido and Fries shoveled onto share-plates, it was with plates piping-hot from lamps that the \"Owner's favorite\" stuffed-Chicken was cut into next, the Cheese not as thick or prevalent as on Salud's Facebook post from November but flavor and technique still great with juicy Bird complimented yet not overwhelmed by Chorizo and Cream Sauce.

Additionally ordering the $25 Duck Carnitas and $19 Mexican Gnocchi, both portions easily sharable but the former unfortunately a bit under flavored without the accompanying Chutney, it should be fairly obvious to anyone paying attention that the Pasta is not \"light\" despite being Vegetarian, three completely distinct flavors of velvety Dumplings highlighted by dark ones tinged in Guajillo Peppers, though all played well off a thick Sauce teaming with Mushrooms.

Packing up several Gnocchi plus a heap of Beans and Rice perfumed with Cilantro for home, easily enough for another diner despite everyone being quite full, it was after being presented a verbal list of sweets that two were decided upon, the Tres Leches Flan a good idea that is unfortunately compromised by bitter Citrus notes while the Churro Waffles fall short of those at CRAFTkitchen by being a bit greasy, though the Whipped Cream, Vanilla Ice Cream and Cajeta do a good job of covering up for it.

***1/2:  Giving credit where it is due, a unique concept these days difficult to find on-Strip let alone in the Suburbs, Salud! Mexican Bistro and Tequileria would be well served to slow down and focus on the details when volume is low instead of trying to lure patrons in with Bingo, AYCE and Comedy Night - as Sparrow & Wolf, Other Mama and Esther's Kitchen have shown great Food and service sells itself."}
{"text":"Run! Don't walk! Get here ASAP because the food is OUTSTANDING and Bernie and Ashley are so nice, helpful, warm and fun. You will experience Mexican food in a way you may never have before (I sure did!) and the even the decor is really awesome. I love this place and I can bet you will too. It's off the beaten path but worth the exploration, because you won't be let down!"}
{"text":"Salud Mexican Bistro and Tequileria is awesome - from the staff all the way to the dessert. My boyfriend and I were greeted warmly and when we were seated, taken care of quickly.

The margarita on the rocks was perfect. I could taste all the flavors without a heavy sour taste, which some margaritas can have. 

I didn't think there would ever come a time when I would rave about chips, but when they're served with a flight of salsa, it's really easy to do. The salsas included green tomatillo, red and a dark oil salsa infused wonderfully with garlic. When you try this salsa, don't forget to scoop up the goodies at the bottom. 

I ordered the Quinoa and Mushroom Chili Relleno. Although this is a vegetarian dish, and I'm not vegetarian, it was just as savory and filling as a non-vegetarian dish. 
My boyfriend opted for the Pollo Sarandeado and couldn't say enough about it (all positive). 

I also had a side salad which was tossed with orange slices and mango which really helped to cool the bit of heat from the relleno. 

For dessert - churro waffles with sliced strawberries, whipped cream and a scoop of ice cream with crispy drizzled chocolate on top. There's only one word I can use to describe the dessert - Divine! 

One of the best Mexican restaurant meals we've had in Las Vegas and I'm we will be back sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you. Inside lies excellent service, owners who take the time to visit every table, made from scratch food that exceeds the highest expectations, margaritas made with all natural fresh ingredients and a humble chef who seems giddy that you enjoyed his food. Please come to Nashville Salud!"}
{"text":"First time we ate here we were a few doors down waiting for my son's bass to get repaired. It was during lunch and the staff recommended this place. We went in and was immediately greeted by the bartender who also ended up our waitress. She was attentive and always came over to check on us. We ordered the octopus appetizer which was delicious. Also recommend ordering their tacos. My bf did't really like the fish dish and the sauces with the chips they give you are ok. My son had their quesadillas and liked them. The frozen drinks were pretty good. Second visit was ok. Maybe because they were busier. Overall good place to get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic new place on Sahara and Cimarron!  In the same parking lot as EOS Fitness. 

One look at the menu and you know right away this isn't your typical tacos, burritos, enchiladas Mexican place (don't get me wrong, they have those too but be brave, try something new). 

Your first hint of the goodness to come is the pre-meal chips and salsa that arrives with a flight of three different salsas. The red one that's oil, garlic and chili is excellent.  I had the Pollo Sarandead. It's chicken stuffed with chorizo on a bed of Spanish rice and an amazing sauce that starts out mild and gives a bit of a kick at the end.  Old family recipe and I can see why. I've never had anything like this in Vegas. Superb! 

This will definitely be my go-to Mexican place on the West Side. Kudos to the chef for the inventive menu and excellent fresh food!!!"}
{"text":"THE PORK BELLY WILL BE THE BEST THING YOULL EAT ALL MONTH!

So basically I went here with my family for dinner last night and let me tell ya, totally worth every penny. 

For appetizers we had the guacamole which had pineapple and mangos in it which was unique but delicious. The queen fundido was top notch. The appetizers platter was also very tasty.

BUT THE PORK BELLY WAS DELICIOUS. My dad ordered it and I could smell it right when the server set it down in from of him. I don't remember what sauce the serve with the dish but oh my goodness it was phenomenal. Easily the best thing I've had in a while.

As for my dinner, I had 2 chicken and 1 lobster taco. Both were very good. I preferred the lobster tacos over the chicken tacos. It was served with Spanish Rice and maybe the best refried Beans I've ever had. My ONLY complaint was that my Spanish rice was slightly undercooked, but honestly i didn't care because everything else was amazing. 

The bartender made all of us drinks after we told her what we liked. My dad wanted something \"sweet\" so the bartender asked if he liked apples and he said yes. She made him this drink that tasted like my mother's homemade apple pie, it was incredible.

I wish I didn't live so far from this place because i would be a weekly visitor.

For only being open 6 months to date on 12/10/2017 they know their stuff and I see nothing but success for them in the future."}
{"text":"It's kind of around the corner and up the street from me and a part of a rather large strip center. When you walk in, it's a nicely dressed establishment. We stopped in for a margarita on happy hour. They don't use sugary bottle mixes, however they need some help with their basic skills on making them, a bit tart... They provide fresh chips, with a few salsas, very good. We tried their street tacos and they were off the charts delicious! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were wonderful and made you feel comfortable. We had fun!"}
{"text":"This is place has so much potential because the food and drinks are remarkable! We came late at night and it was dead, so maybe work on marketing themselves a little more. My girlfriend and i just really needed a drink, and we were really feeling margaritas. This place had a LOADED margarita menu, even seasonal flavors. We ordered the classic and cucumber basil, but i secretly wanted to try their watermelon ginger haha. The surf and turf pizza was also loaded with ingredients and just tasted so fresh and meaty and was so filling! Will definitely be back for their other items and hopefully seasonal drinks!"}
{"text":"I love this place very much staff is awesome food is great I am Muchacho Boracho. The empanadas are delicious the lobster pizza is delicious the street tacos are delicious the margaritas are delicious esaid"}
{"text":"Salud is next to my gym, so I had to try it out after a workout. I ordered their lamb burrito. Great! Great! Great! I am looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Perfect Happy Hour Margarita, couldn't had finished a busy work week any better  Nicole and Ashley were super delightful. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Modern feel with modern food.  Everything is fresh and tasty.  Staff is super-friendly.  Don't feel you can go wrong ordering anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Margarita Mondays! After hearing a lot about this place and their $22 all you can eat tacos and margaritas, I decided to give it a try with my friend after work on a Monday. This is a hidden little gem, right next to the EOS gym. I was so excited when I found out they have 3 vegan options for tacos! 

 For my first plate of tacos, I tried all 3 of the vegan option tacos which included the hibiscus taco, soy based taco and chipotle mushroom taco. My favorite was the soy based tacos, so good! They kinda had the same texture as ground beef but softer. I would highly recommend them. The all you can drink margaritas only include the traditional house margaritas. 

Pros: there's a bar area, great specials, vegan options, friendly staff, good service 

Cons: found out there is a time limit on the $22 special

Tips*** if you enroll in the yelp cash back, this place participates in the yelp cash back program!  also the waitress let me know a secret, they are working on a vegan desert. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my family. The place was welcoming, friendly, and clean. The prices are on the high side. I enjoyed the pozole and the lobster empanadas, but did not like the tamale because the tamale meat had too much fat, and I just didn't like the rice and beans. I've had homemade and restaurant tamales my entire life but never had a tamale like this. I understand there are different styles of Mexican and Tex Mex foods but I don't think a higher end restaurant should have this much fat in their meat. I know the pork belly meat is fatty but I had chunks of just fat in there. The red salsa was good, the green one had no flavor, and the brown one was a mystery. I'm giving 2 stars instead of 3 for the bad experience of having attempted to eat the fat and higher prices. Food presentation is nice but taste and price overrides for me. I didn't try my chicken enchilada so not reviewing it."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at this restaurant. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The hostess and waitress were friendly and attentive. The owner checked on us and asked for feedback since it's a new restaurant. That meant a lot that it wanted to improve and meet customer satisfaction. If ever in the area again, I would go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg my waiter was sooooo friendly! Loved it! The bartender seated us since the hostess was MIA, she said they were out of their popular watermelon ginger margarita-but my waiter found me one anyway!!! Soooo yummy! 
The food was great! He recommended an octopus  appetizer and I seriously thought it was a tender piece of fish--it wasn't rubbery it was absolutely delicious with sooooo much flavor! I'm glad he recommended it. 
The tacos were soooo good I put some of the garlic oils that came with the chips and salsa on my taco and BAM! Instant yummy! 
The relleno was stuffed with lots of crab and shrimp and was sooo good, but I honestly adored the lobster tacos! 
The tequila flights...yummy! 
And the flan....wow! 
I drank it all and ate it all and nothing was disappointing at all! All amazing!!!!! 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a fan of Mexican Bistro's because the usual Roberto's or Alberto's does the trick, but right from the get-go the feel of this place was very warm and welcoming. 

Service: The staff was very friendly and efficient. Polite and helpful! The hostess was peppy and cracked a lot of corny jokes. I'm a sucker for corny jokes. Our server was very nice and our water and chips and salads were filled to the brim at all times. 

Food: it was delicious! I ordered their Chipotle Mushroom Chimichanga, and my friend got the Carne Asada Fries and Lamb Chimichanga. The flavors were very unique and it exploded in my mouth. *wink* They had this chili garlic oil sauce for the chips that made me drooool. You guys should try it. 

Venue Ambience: it wasn't your typical mariachi band Mexican Spanish radio music playing in the background, it's actual hipster-top 40 hispanish American music. Very loungey. The internal design of the place was very gastro pub-ish retro/hipster thing. 


Overall, I'd come back here again. The food is delicious and try the dessert!"}
{"text":"We decided to try something new and we are not at all disappointed! First, they had a special going on, all you can eat tacos and all you can drink classic margaritas, in honor of Game 5 Las Vegas Knights vs Capitals. We had the Mushroom Chipotle, Carne Asada, Al Pastor, Soy, Pork Belly, and Cheek Barbacoa Tacos... yes we went in every taco we tasted was so good, can't go wrong picking which taco you want. We even tried their Vegan tacos, our top faves: Mushroom Chipotle, Soy, and Cheek Barbacoa. Can't boast about this place enough! Lastly, we want to thank our fabulous server, Marcie, she was so attentive; definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing. The staff is super friendly and down to earth, the ambiance is the perfect social atmosphere, and If you're brave, try the habanero tequila shot!"}
{"text":"Great service and food was delicious! Ordered 3 tacos chicken, lobster and shrimp and Carne Asada fries."}
