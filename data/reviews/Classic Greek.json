{"text":"Wanted to try out some local Greek food and this was the closest one to our home. Couple of things to review on.  Environment - this is not a good place to dine in at. Majority of the business that we could see that night was for take out. We decided to dine in and it wasn't the greatest experience. There's only a couple of tables, and didn't feel that clean.  Food - the food was not bad. Wasn't the best nor was it the worst. For a quick Greek fix I guess this could work, if you are a foodie this probably won't do it for you. Portions are decent."}
{"text":"I ordered food for delivery. It came 1 hr later - which is waayyy too long for the food to take. We were starving and sadly  when we sat down to eat they got my order wrong. Food was mediocre - won't return."}
{"text":"This is a quick, bang-for-your-buck Greek food place to go.  The people there are friendly, however the service can be service slow.   $9.50 for chicken Souvlaki dinner with pita, salad and two sides (side options: rice, potatoes, fries and onion rings) .  Good portion.   ($5.99 for smaller version of the dinner.  I did not try this portion size).  The restaurant itself needs major updating, looks clean enough, but old.  I did take out, not tempted to eat-in."}
{"text":"We did order our food for my daughter engagement party in September for 90 people and everything was perfect from on time to delishes taste Everybody loved the food .Thank you Clasic Greek staff for your excellent service and keep up the great work We will see you again soon And I would definitely recommend this place to everybody Thank you Thank you Thank you"}
{"text":"Very friendly service and tasty food. We arrived 10 minutes prior to closing to get take out.  After apologising to the owner for the last minute order, he kindly agreed to make what he could.  Three gyro platters and souvlaki later, we were on our way to relatives house with a late dinner.    Good to eat in and great for take out.  Good sized portions and very good food. Will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Our go to Greek Restaurant in Stouffville.   The $5.99 mini souvlaki dinner is a solid bang for your buck. Never disappointed in the past 4 years we have been visiting this establishment."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, even though it is indian/Sri Lankan guys that cook the food. They cook really good, I never get disappointed if I eat here. I'd give this place 5 stars, but because sometimes they are forgetful and putting things in the bag, I walk out with a missing drink or food item. They are nice humans though, so it's just a slight issue. I just ordered take out, just now.. lol"}
{"text":"The service is good. Food quantity is great for the price, the taste not so much. I found the meat to be under cooked and fries to be very greasy."}
