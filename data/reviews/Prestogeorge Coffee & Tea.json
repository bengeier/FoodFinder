{"text":"I, was Visiting from out of Town, &  I stopped in for a Cup of Coffee. Not One Employee even said Hello!  i waited for 10min. or longer, for service!  I walked out! I get better Service at  Burger King! and Most likely the Coffee is Better!!"}
{"text":"This is a unique review in that I have never actually been to the store. I ordered green coffee beans via their website as I have recently become interested in roasting beans.   The website ordering platform was easy to use. However, because of my impatience I called two days after placing my order to receive an order status. While I forgot my order number the staff was fantastic. I believe they even got a chuckle at my home roasting enthusiasm!   Even better my oder arrived that same day so they were incredibly fast with their shipping. In short, I had a great experience and I look forward to ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Even when I don't need any coffee or tea I love popping my head into this place to look at the rows upon rows of glass tubs filled with every kind of coffee bean and tea leaf your heart could desire ....and the smell is heavenly. The one time they didn't have the obscure tea I wanted they immediately offered to try to find it and have it in stock for the following week. Everyone here is extremely helpful and I've tasted many a fine teas and coffees thanks to them."}
{"text":"I've become a coffee snob thanks to this place. There's no going back to garbage coffee once you've had the good stuff from here..."}
{"text":"Great prices & selection. Fast shipping. Friendly employees. We always stop by the store when we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time in Pittsburgh and when I was here a year ago, I happened upon Prestogeorge in The Strip District by accident when I was running by and someone stopped to ask me the time and he was horribly disappointed the shop had just closed as he was driving from quite a ways to get some coffee. I knew it had to be something special if this person was coming from quite a distance just to buy coffee. I went back the next day and found the tea selection to be the best I've ever found in the USA. (Sorry not a coffee drinker nor have I eaten at the deli so this review is from the tea perspective only.)   Back in Pittsburgh now and it was one of my first stops this trip plus I had my sister stop for me when she was in town earlier this year and she loved it too.  Here's what I've purchased in loose teas:   DeCaf Cherry Sencha (if you like cherries you'll love this tea. Closest thing to drinking the best cherries you've ever eaten. On the expensive side compared to the others I purchased but worth every dime)  Blueberry Black  English Breakfast  Strawberry Black  Wild Cherry Black  Creme Earl Gray  Blackfruits White   I bought a few 1/8 lbs, 1/4 lbs and a 1/2 lb of the sencha and my total bill was $37. All of the teas are excellent and I only wished I had a tea shop like this in my area. Great news is that they do ship anywhere and have a great website for ordering.   The tea guy that helped me this time is the same as last year and he's very nice and helpful.   The only thing lacking is space to sit and enjoy (very limited seating with just 1 table).   I'd say if you're  in Pittsburgh and if you like tea or coffee (coffee I can only judge from the long line and great smell!) this is a must visit (or check out their on line shop if you're out of area). Be sure to check the hours because like everything in The Strip, they close early."}
{"text":"Awesome experience today. I hope that they never stop selling my fav coffee thsnk. Guys always a great time"}
{"text":"Been coming here to buy whole bean coffee for years.  Excellent prices and perfect roasts."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop with a great selection of fresh ground coffee, loose tea, and other goodies.  My wife and i picked up a cup of fresh brewed coffee for our stroll around the Strip.  Great cup of coffee and not expensive at all. Friendly and helpful staff.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Friendly staff member showed us the fresh coffee beans and the massive roasters one morning. Amazing coffee"}
{"text":"Best coffee in the burgh. The customer service is always great to boot! I used to come here on a daily basis and ALWAYS go when I'm able to get down to the strip. They provide the largest selection of latte flavors and teas. The sandwiches are good and the breakfast choices are also good - the cinnamon buns heated up are the ish."}
{"text":"Dear anyone looking for a selection of flavored coffees that tastes great,  Prestogeorge has an amazing number of coffees as everyone has previously mentioned, however the flavors are irrelevant.  Let me start by saying I am a huge flavored coffee fan, with my two favorite places to buy coffee online being http://www.greenmountaincoffee.com and http://www.griggscoffeehouse.com/catalog/index.php  I had previously only been to Fortune's coffee in the strip, and was also impressed with their flavor selection but not with the actual flavors of the coffee.  After telling people this I was told to try Prestogeorge's and that I would be amazed.  So, but trusting their judgements, I purchased 5 - 1/2lb flavors, of which I am finally trying the fifth.  The first 2 you couldnt barely tell that their was flavoring, which is insane for a flavored coffee (vanilla butter nut & pumpking spice ), the next 2 had some flavor, but I wouldnt call them amazing (creme brulee and rain forest crunch) and the last is Blueberry, which from Green mountain coffees is my all time favorite coffee.  I am drinking this while I write this morning and unfortunately there is no flavor here as well.    I am unsure why the coffees have no flavor, but IT could be that they are very old and have been sitting in the jars for long enough for the flavor to disperse.  Granted, the coffee itself still tastes fine, in fact if you were just going for plain coffee I may even recommend it.  Anyway, my hopes were not to give Prestogeorge a bad rap, but to stop anyone from making the trip in hopes of getting excellent flavored coffee in Pittsburgh.  Just order from one of the two sites I listed above."}
{"text":"Is it possible to have and raise a family in this place? Cuz if so, I'm all in.   I had previously stopped in here months ago for a deli sandwich and seasonal flavored latte. It was tasty but nothing out of the ordinary...  Today I went in with the intent of researching espresso makers and French presses. While staring quizzically at their merchandise a man, I believe to be the store owner addressed me and was ridiculously helpful without being pushy. He showed me some products, recommended some coffees based on my preferences, and even took time to show me their magical roasting machines in the back. I wanted to hug and snuggle him but I was afraid they'd ask me to leave before I made a purchase.   I ended up buying some deli meats along with 3 different flavors of fresh coffee grounds. Every person was so Pittsburgh friendly and I will surely be back again.   P.S. Their baked goods are white girl \"can't even\" good too."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop in the strip. All of the employees are friendly and the store smells amazing. They have SO many different varieties of coffee and tea that it's a little overwhelming. The store is very small, so its best to get what you need and go. They also sell odd and ends like lunch meat and a variety of jams. I would recommend prestogeorges to anyone visiting the strip district!"}
{"text":"I love Prestogeorge. Amazing whole bean coffee selection that never disappoints. (Tons of teas too, but I have yet to try) Friendly and knowledgeable staff if you're looking to try something different. Excellent baristas. Went out of my black coffee comfort zone today and tried a vanilla bean latte - so so good. Agree with other yelpers - super reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"A friend of mine worked at Prestogeorge in the Strip for about a year. She gave me some of their coffee as a Christmas gift last year and since then, I'm hooked! This is by far, the best coffee I've EVER had. Beats Starbucks by a mile! Vermont Maple and Holiday Blend are seriously amazing coffees...you've gotta try them!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering their Creme Earl Grey and Sleep Tight Tea for a while now after being introduced to their teas by a co-worker. I didn't think anything of them, until my coworker made the creme earl grey as iced tea and I mixed it with Trader Joe's lemonade. OH MAN, next level arnold palmers. That touch of vanilla makes it so, SO good.  Highly recommended if you're into Earl Grey."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I don't really drink coffee, so I can't say anything about that, but their loose leaf tea is well worth a trip to the Strip District. There's a great selection (seems like hundreds!). They sell black tea, green tea, red tea, herbal tea, white tea...so come and try some; you're guaranteed to find a blend you like if you're a tea drinker like I am! My advice would be to buy a quarter pound of a few of the teas that smell good and I bet you will find one you enjoy. There have only been a select few that I thought were \"just okay\" (and I've tried a lot), but since they have such a wide variety, I guess you can't say that's too bad. I recommend coming here for sure."}
{"text":"J.P. Hearty or die. If you need the beans, you need Prestogeorge."}
{"text":"The selection of teas here is hard to beat.  Everything from chai tea to Earl Grey.  I haven't had any of their snacks yet but they look pretty good and wilprobably try one next time I visit."}
{"text":"They sell SO MANY different kinds of coffee beans and tea. This place is wonderful and cozy. Local specialty stores like this should be highly recognized!   Found this shop just by walking through the Strip saturday morning. I was surprised to find all the walls with shelves of different coffee beans! An older man greeted us happily and suggested we try the Sumatra beans or the P.J. beans as he said they were the most popular ones sold.  We went with 1/4 lb of the P.J. beans and he handed them to us in a cute white paper baggie. The coffee aroma from the bag is heavenly! I can't wait to brew this cup of Joe!"}
{"text":"This place is still really good.   I went in here to buy some loose leaf tea that I saw the last time I was there, squeezed my way to the back of the store, and tried to decide what I wanted. I was helped by an older gentleman who knew more about tea than I'm sure anyone else, and he steered me towards a few selections of tea, which turns out, I love. I will definitely return and get more tea and probably some coffee as well."}
{"text":"Their coffee and tea are the best in the burgh! I love watching the coffee roasting in the back. Also, I usually do not enjoy flavored coffee, but I have loved many varieties that I have bought here. Definitely worth a visit while in the Strip District!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to the Strip and shopping at Prestogeorge for years. When I moved to the DC area I couldn't find any coffee as good as Prestogeorge's. Luckily, you can order online and have it shipped to your house. Every time I order it comes to my door the next day. This is such a plus for me since I always wait until the last minute to order coffee when I'm running low. You can order whole beans or have them ground to your specific coffee pot/french press. My favorite flavor of coffee is coconut cream. My only complaint is that they don't send you a receipt via email or shipping confirmation. But really, who needs an email when it comes the next day with a printed receipt in the box? Please give this place a try if you're looking for the best and freshest coffee around!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to buy coffee beans or tea. They have one of the biggest selections I have seen. I came here to buy some nice coffee as a gift and chose the Cuban blend. I got it freshly ground and the smell is delicious and overwhelming. I had to quickly put it in an airtight container to try to preserve the flavor as long as possible.   You can also buy coffee and tea drinks in the store, though there is no where to sit. I got a small coffee with the same Cuban beans that I bought as a gift. The taste was excellent, very rich, robust and strong.   Service is very good and it's nice that they open at 7:00 on Saturdays for early people so you can beat the crowds.   Prices are reasonable and not so high that I wouldn't think of coming back and getting myself a little treat of some exquisite coffee beans."}
{"text":"The perfectly balanced cappuccino -- skim milk, extra shot --warmed the cockles of my heart.  $9.49 for an aromatic pound of Italian Blend espresso beans lovingly roasted on premise had my wallet  -- and then our espresso machine -- singing \"O Sole Mio.\"  Nattily dressed coffologists -- sporting plaid button-fronts and page-boy caps -- ignited the same butterflies that drove my obsession with \"Newsies\" in middle school.  So many reasons to love this little independent wonder."}
{"text":"Best and most consistent coffee.  Got hooked on Presto George (PG) when I lived in PGH back in 2007.  Move to California and still buy nothing but PG still for home brewing.  I also travel with it if I can brew my own there too.  That's how good it is and how dedicated we are to PG.  If you are a biscotti lover, or just fan, PG will ruin you for any other biscotti.  Their carmel almond chocolate swirl is our all time favorite.   Just because you may not live here, does not mean you can't enjoy PG.  Visit and buy online at www.prestogeorge.com .  I am not affiliated with them, just swear by them."}
{"text":"Has this place changed hands recently. Went in to pickup coffee today and didn't recognize a single face behind the counters. I have saying hello to these people a couple times a month for years and today? Not one familiar face. Store looked different too. Hope the coffee is still just as good."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got cheese in my tummy.  This place is very compact.  I felt a bit overwhelmed. There is just so much to look at.  On my visit to PFF I got a 16oz cappuccino and a grilled cheese with bacon.  Maybe you are asking yourself how awesome can a grilled cheese sandwich really be please read on.  The cheese on my sandwich was melted all the way through no cold center to be found here.  The bacon was perfectly crisp too.  I was a little concerned about this because from across the deli counter I didn't see any real cook station.  It looks as if they are back there working with a microwave and a toaster oven.  But really I had nothing to worry about because the sandwich came out perfect.  There is some real magic happening behind that counter.  I seriously doubt I could ever hope to replicate that grilled cheese at home with my toaster oven...maybe it's industrial grade?  Bonus,  they served it with a little pickle.    The cappuccino was also very good. The foam was knuckle deep. Now that's something you're not going to get a Dunkin Doughnuts.   Prestogeorge makes food...but there is only one table inside that could probably seat about 4 people comfortably.  You might want to be mindful of that in case you're looking to dine in.  I was able to snag the table with it being 7 degrees outside...it wasn't too busy and it was Wednesday too.  My only hang up is that the 16oz drink is the smallest drink size.  I ended up wasting about 1/3rd of my beverage."}
{"text":"Since recently taking a more serious interest in brewing my own coffee, I am willing to go in search of a better bean.  Prestogeorge is top of my list.    I always marvel at their selection of coffees, the different types of beans and roasts.  The wall off coffee can be intimidating, but the staff is knowledgeable and helpful without being pretentious.  I started off with the JP Hearty Blend and was not disappointed.  I've since purchased other blends including the Italian espresso (which I used to make some delicious chocolate covered espresso beans) and the Vienna Roast (which I use for cold brewing).  Loose leaf tea is also available as well as brewing supplies.  If flavored coffee is more your thing, it is definitely not in short supply here.  Prestogeorge also serves beverages and some food items but I have never tried anything prepared there.    The cost of their coffee and supplies is more than reasonable when compared to national brands available in local grocery stores.  And for coffee roasted on site where you can watch the process, you can't beat it."}
{"text":"The only problem I have with Prestogeorge coffee is that it makes most other coffee taste like sadness.  Seriously.  Once you start buying your coffee here, you can't accept anything less.  I see the bottom of the coffee-bean canister and start to panic: how soon can I get over there and buy more?  Don't be overwhelmed, just try something; it's going to be great, whatever you choose.    Plus, if you have a child in tow, the person working the cash register always offers little ones a cookie.  My daughter never, ever minds an errand run at Prestogeorge!"}
{"text":"If you like to switch up your coffee and tea cabinet frequently, Prestogeorge is the place to go. The selection of loose-leaf teas is mind-blowing, the house made drinks are super delicious, and most importantly, the crew that works here are seriously just excellent people. Always worth stopping in."}
{"text":"I so, so want to give 5 stars, as I had the best coffee drink of my life here.  So much so, that I came back the next day to order it again (crossing my fingers that the same barista was working).  Unfortunately, the next day was Sunday, and they are closed on Sundays.  I've never heard of a coffee shop being closed on a Sunday.  That's the day I'm most likely to drink coffee!  I took off a half star for that, and a half star for no restrooms."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an excellent cup of coffee and coffee beans to take home, stop by Prestogeorge Coffee! Located in The Strip District in Pittsburgh, this speciality shop has everything for all of your caffeinated needs. I stopped by to pick up a Marshmallow Latte and became a fan. My daughter ordered a Thin Mint Latte, which was pretty amazing too!"}
{"text":"It's been a long time but as good as ever.  When I worked for PPG and lived in Latrobe 25 years ago, one of my favorite things to do on the weekend was to drive down to the Strip District and go produce shopping.  One of my stops would always be at my favorite Coffee Roasters called Prestogeorge. This was before the days when Starbucks or Caribou became the rage.  Even after I moved back to NC, I continued to order coffee from Prestogeorge for some time but eventually got away from it.  On our most recent trip to the area, we took the afternoon off and drove down to the Strip District and Prestogeorge was on my agenda.  Finally found a parking space and walked to where I remembered it to be and to my horror, they were gone.  My horror was short lived because it turns out that they had been renting their space and when another came up for sale, they bought it and moved about a block down the street and on the other side.  If I had paid more attention when I got out of my car , I would have seen it because my car was parked less than 20 feet from their front door.  Walked in the that warm aroma of fresh roasted coffee hit me and brought back fond memories or great coffee. Bought a pound of Costa Rica Tarrazu, a pound of Tanzania Peaberry Coffee and a pound of Ethiopian Yirachefe to take back to NC.  Still working on the Tarrazu and it's great and looking forward to trying the other two shortly.  Based on this experience, it's time to start ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today with my fiance in order to pick up some loose leaf tea and also to get some cups of coffee.  I have been to Prestogeorge Fine Foods before but it has been awhile.  While the outside doesn't look like too much the inside is pretty nice, albeit a bit crowded and small.  On this occasion there were not many people inside which made it nice and easy to walk around.  Besides a rather large number of coffees they also boast to have over 300 loose leaf teas.  All of their coffees and teas are behind the counter and you have to get help to buy any of them.  I thought that it was odd and made looking at the different kinds difficult.  It was only after we left the store that my fiance said that they had lists of what they had to offer.  Whoops!  Next time I suppose that I will have to look at that.  The service for the two teas that I got was good and I was able to easily ask the guy for the right amount for me.  The coffee was also easy to order although I was surprised at the lack of coffee drinks that they serve for a place that specializes in coffee.  Thankfully they did have my go to drink, the Americano and my fiance and I both ordered one in the only size that they had.  After receiving it I asked for some cream and was pointed around the corner and found only half and half in the little pre-sealed cup.  Once again for a place specializing in coffee this was a bit disappointing. Thankfully the taste of the Americano more than made up for that as it was strong and extremely smooth.  My fiance also enjoyed hers as well.  The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future not only for their large selection of loose leaf teas but also for their Americanos.   Make sure that if you want anything from behind the counter to look at their lists as I surely will the next time that I am there.  I also hope that in the future they will have some milk in addition to the half and half but I am not holding my breath."}
{"text":"We have been customers of Prestogeorge coffee for many years now. We are local caterers and when we prepare the coffee bar for our customers we brew either Honuras or J P blend. We recieve many compliments and want to pass this on to you! I am also from a family run business of 40 years. It is very nice to see you take such pride in your craft. If I had questions needing answered, your staff is very knowledgeable of their product!      Andy"}
{"text":"Of all of the wonderful shops in the Strip District, this is my favorite.  Yes, I'm a coffee-junkie and I believe that nobody has a better selection of fresh, interesting coffee flavors -- not even that other coffee shop at the other end of the Strip.  My wife is a tea-aholic and the selection of teas is equally oustanding.  But there's more to PFF: the staff is one of the friendliest and most welcoming \"family\" I've ever encountered.  If you want great coffee and tea merchandised with warmth and concern for the customer, run to PFF.    And try the following coffee blends:   J P Hearty   Black and Gold (not a gimmick but a great blend!)   Sumatra  And the peanut butter is wonderful, too!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the strip district. The aroma alone is what drew me in. Let me tell you the list they have for iced latte flavors is ridiculous! I stuck with my favorite simple Caramel iced latte. They transform it to something amazing and delicious. Perfection. I haven't checked out all the other stuff they have to offer but the lattes were the best I've ever had. I did get a brownie there that was a little disappointing and stale. But I don't go there for the brownies."}
{"text":"I love this place.    I start loving this place before I walk through the door because the aroma of coffee is just pure heaven  If you love coffee, you'll love Prestogeorge.  They have everything, and if you aren't sure what you need, they somehow just know exactly what you need and will just tell you.  You know what else is really impressive?  The sheer volume of products they have in their tiny space.  This store is packed with goodies.    It's also a good lunch spot!  They've got good sandwiches and salads.  Sometimes the weight can be a little long, but its worth it and any way you will be busy looking at everything the store offers, from European cookies to tea to coffee.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Bought whole coffee beans today.... coconut cream & the morning buzz (1/2 lb of each). Paid less than $11! Made the CC when I got home.... AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"a hundred kinds of gourmet coffee and loose leaf tea. I walked out with three bags of tea and a tea strainer.  they'll ship anywhere!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Prestogeorge. I'm a tea fanatic and I've ordered off of a lot of sites online and bought from a lot of stores in person, but I've never found a tea retailer that has delivered the consistent value, variety, and quality of Prestogeorge. They offer hundreds of specialty teas and coffees at prices that are well below what you would pay elsewhere. The staff are always courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient. They give excellent recommendations.  One of my favorite teas is the Ti Quan Yin, which retails for triple the price elsewhere. The special jasmine green tea and the lemon sencha are also excellent. Their coffee is high quality, as well. And the biscotti are delicious. I live in DC, but I always wait to buy tea and coffee until I'm in Pittsburgh so I can go to Prestogeorge. If I could give it more than five stars, I would."}
{"text":"Great coffee stop with the drum roasting process visible in the back. Tons of beans to choose from to buy as well. The coffee itself was better than average with a good balance of mocha, milk, and espresso. Matts regular latte was nice and smooth. Would have been cold to hear about their way of roasting as it is so visible, but they appeared to busy to bother about it. Maybe next trip."}
{"text":"I adore Prestogeorge. They've got a ton of freshly roasted coffees, which is great. Also? Lots and lots of loose-leaf tea. I may be willing to admit a small tea addiction, and this is one of my favorite places to try something new. I've given coffee and tea from here as gifts and they've always been well-received; it's especially nice that I can get whatever grind I'd like.  There's also a smallish selection of gourmet foods, and my husband likes some of the dips. Then again, he likes most dips.  My favorite, favorite thing here, though, is the staff. I always end up stopping here and buying SOMETHING when I'm in the Strip, because they're amazingly friendly and more than willing to help with any questions. When people go on and on about \"back in the day, the mom and pop stores really took care of you blah blah fishcakes,\" this is the kind of service I imagine."}
{"text":"Kicks. Butt.  Prestogeorge is a family run roastery on the Strip District that pumps out some interesting and fun flavors.  They have an incredibly wide selection of flavors to please anyone.  Their tea selection is QUITE impressive!   While they dont have as many fair trade options as I hoped for, the food and service is exceptional.  Yet another great place to chill and hang out on the Strip."}
{"text":"Coffee is good. Customer service is TERRIBLE. Honestly one of the worst experiences I've ever had. The lady (who I presume is the owner) at the front making coffee drinks was extremely unprofessional and blatantly angry that she had to help anyone with anything. I asked for one of my iced coffees with no ice so that I could bring it to my sister  without it being watered down and she said \"so hot\" and I said nope, just brewed like ice coffee would be just don't put the ice in because I'm traveling with it. About 30 seconds later she handed me the coffee with tons of ice in it and walked away. I waited for about 5 minutes for her to walk back and asked if she could remove the ice for me and she told me no it would get warm. I AGAIN explained that I was traveling with it and she would add ice when I gave it to her. She rolled her ice and scooped a couple ice cubes out and set it on the counter and walked away without saying a word. She was also snapping her fingers and screaming at other employees there. There was a young man who was busy doing other things. She yelled at him from across the shop to go find her something. He was actively looking for it and she just kept screaming \"NO!!! To the RIGHT of you!!\" In front of about 10 customers. Clearly the young man was stressed and embarrassed by her actions, as I would be. 0 stars for this woman. Coffee is good but we'll never be back."}
{"text":"Fresh coffee, nice selection of organic beans, knowledgeable and friendly staff and decent prices. Very proud of their freshness here--an employee insisted that my friend shove his hand into the bag of coffee he just bought to feel the warmth of the freshly roasted beans. Hesitantly, he did and admitted it was quite warm. Venturing back into the icy Strip District streets, the toasty little packages were a nice perk in our coat pockets."}
{"text":"Prestogeorge is not entirely at fault for my coffee addiction, but it IS what got me off Starbucks/Keurig cups and into the jittery world of grind-your-own-coffee enthusiasm.  They have so many different blends and flavors, all roasted on site.  A few of my favorites:  Italian Roast (Espresso--the old standby), 100% Kona (Delicious, but $$$$, so an occasional treat), Vermont Maple, Coconut Cream  They also have a full deli, specialty foods, and as many kinds of loose tea as they have coffee blends.  Every time I'm at Prestogeorge stocking up on beans, I think about starting a loose tea collection...but that would surely lead to over-caffeination."}
{"text":"I happen to be a big tea fan, and they have so many different flavors of loose leaf tea. The employees are always so friendly, and I never come out empty handed or disappointed!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the Strip District, Prestogeorge is always on my list of must-visit shops. When you walk in you are greeted with the smiling faces of all of the friendly employees and the aroma of freshly roasted coffee. You can order hot or cold coffee or tea drinks or some small lunch items like wraps and sandwiches. My main attraction here, though, is the loose tea collection.  I'm a huge tea drinker and I have little white paper bags of Presto teas all over my kitchen. Their loose teas are extremely fairly priced, and they have a variety that would even leave the pickiest tea drinker with something he or she was excited to try. A couple of my favorites have been the blackberry sage black tea, the Japanese tea garden green tea, and the Temple of Heaven gunpowder green tea. They have brewing supplies as well as an extensive selection of coffees, which I'm sure are all lovely, but I usually stick to tea as it's always been my preference. Next time you're in the strip and looking for some herbal love or an afternoon pick-me-up, Prestogeorge is the place to go!"}
{"text":"They have an extensive assortment of coffee beans and a friendly, quick staff. I wound up getting their Sumatra beans and loved them."}
{"text":"Prestogeorge Fine Foods it says. But it's under the Coffee and Tea category. I guess it's both. It's a very small shop that's crammed full of goods. Coffee beans (flavored coffee, raised eyebrow) coffee equipment, other supplies, some food and lots of loose leaf tea.   I stop in here just to look around every time I'm in the Strip. It's the type of place that my Grandpa would have been going to for the last forty years. It's just got an old school European feel. I like it. Walk in the packed space and look around. Go look at the coffee roaster in the back or ask the tall clown-lookin guy with glasses for a recommendation on some tea. It's not got the class or refined feel of some of the new places but it's absolutely wonderful in its own special way."}
{"text":"I love Presto George!   Honestly, this is the best smelling store in Pittsburgh. I don't know that anyone is necessarily going for that. . . But if they were. . . Presto has it. They should get a trophy.   Presto George sells a lot of things, but I go to get coffee. Flavored coffee to be exact. There are so many varieties. They roast the beans themselves. You can get full 1lb bags, half 1/2lb bags, or 1/4lb bags of coffee beans. They can grind them for you as well! Why not try four 1/4lb bags of different flavors? Why not?!? AH!   . . .   My recommendations?   1. French Apple Crumble (just close your head into the container for 10-15 min to behold the amazing aroma)   2. Toasted Almond   3. Highlander Creme   4. Anything else   So, I gave this store 4 stars over 5 because I come here specifically for flavored coffee. I have a separate grinder for flavored coffee and use it primarily for drip. I just know I'm not going to get an Intelligentsia quality bean/roast here that I'll use for pour over. No dagger in the heart here. You have to know and stay in your lane, and Presto George has theirs.   In fact, they're number one."}
{"text":"Best place in the Burgh to buy coffee and loose leaf tea by the pound. They have a very extensive collection of coffee beans including signature blends, organic beans, flavored beans, seasonal beans, decaffeinated beans and dark roasts, all of which are sourced from various countries around the world. They also offer a very wide-ranging loose leaf tea menu - honestly any type of tea you can imagine they carry. Store is very small so it's best to purchase what you need and get out. You can order coffee or tea on your way out from the baristas, as well as some bakery items."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get an americano.  It tastes just like a Starbucks americano.  Maybe this is good for Pittsburgh?  I grew up here, but didn't start drinking coffee until after I left."}
{"text":"This place has cheap brewed coffee, a wide loose leaf tea selection, and something like a deli counter. I want to compare it to Allegheny Coffee Exchange down the street.   Comparing the tea-setup (not necessarily the taste): ACE has a more convenient and organized set up, with the loose leaf tea pre-bagged and sealed, while Prestogeorge has them still in their large jars.  I haven't bought the coffee grounds from Prestogeorge yet, so I can't compare that.   The place itself is kind of cluttered, and there isn't much room for customers to walk or to be in a line for something. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We rotate our coffee purchases between here and La Prima.  It's a tad overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking for, but the staff is ready and willing to help direct you to a coffee bean that is perfect for your taste.  We've tried many different varieties of the dark blends, and all are delicious.  I highly recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome Lattes!! Great selection. My favorite coffee stop in the Strip District. Has that great Strip District feel and wasn't overly busy on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Swung through here the other day as I needed some beans for the house, and I wasn't getting to my normal favorite spot for a week or so. Very glad I did! Speaking to one of the counterfolk, I found her knowledgeable about coffee, and they offered to show me the roasting area. They had a solid selection of various regional beans from all over. I selected some Celebes and my old favotite, Jamaican Blue Mountain. The latter I am often skeptical about, as there have been problems with the authenticity of this bean through the years. One look and I knew they were real...and the freshness brought a great cup the next morning. Nice shop, wide selection, helpful and smart staff...we can do this again! Well done!"}
{"text":"This is the only place we get our coffee and tea. They have a huge selection, the staff are always helpful and they have a lot of specialty foods. Prices on coffee/espresso/tea makers are very reasonable and they have a deli with coffee, smoothies and more. There is something for everyone at this cute, adorable shop and it is packed full of goodies from floor to ceiling. Def should be on your list of places to check out when you visit the Strip District."}
{"text":"This is, by far, one of my favorite places in the Strip District! My favorite tea is the China Rose tea, which not only has a beautiful look to it, but has a wonderful taste! The Apple Caramel Almond is also very good, complete with halved almonds! The milk oolong tea is a little more pricey, but tastes almost like buttery popcorn! It is so unique and exquisite. There are so many coffees and teas to choose from that you could get lost all day just smelling the coffees and choosing which ones you want to take home! You can buy tea pots and infusers here to accompany your new loose leaf teas if you need something new or want to try different ways to drink tea. The prices are absolutely phenomenal. Depending on the tea, for about 2 oz of loose leaf teas or coffee, you are looking at a minimum of $1 and some change! The space is small, so it can be overwhelming when it's busy, but once the crowd dies down, you can really take your time and enjoy the coffees and teas without feeling rushed. Definitely check out this place, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This coffeeshop is a winner.  They have deli foods, which always have a happy line, but I've never managed to try them.  I made a beeline for the back of the shop, where they probably have fifty varieties of coffee beans, and at least as many varieties of tea.  Behind the coffee, in a glass-walled room, is the roaster, this enormous machine that lets them roast the beans fresh, all the time, in the store.  Behind the counter is an older guy named John Prestogeorge.  When I asked him for a recommendation, he suggested the J.P. Hearty blend on their coffee list, which is a blend he started selling in the 1960's.  He's still there.  It's still good.  Lately, I've moved to the organic sumatran, and really want to try the kona; I'm confident they'll be around for awhile, and I'll be headed back."}
{"text":"I've had coffee and tea in the north and south, and on the east and west coasts, and Prestogeorge is among the best in the country.  (Side note: The make some pretty damn good sammiches too!)  Not only is the selection of coffee and loose leaf teas to be marveled at, but the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Coffee is available in just about any grind. Prices of both coffees and teas are extremely reasonable. Although the line can be long, it is not because of a lack of service - only a large volume of faithful clients. 10 times out of 10, I would go out of my way for Prestogeorge coffees and teas. For nearly 10 years, and in three different states, I continued to order from Prestogeorge online.  Stop going to Starbucks. Quit buying crappy coffee at the grocery store.  Go to Prestogeorge!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The coffee selection is out of this world and the coffee itself is wonderful! It is smooth and just terrific!"}
{"text":"Prestogeorge has one of my favorite selections for loose leaf tea in Pittsburgh! It's worth a visit for just that. When I worked in the Strip District I loved their coffee and lunch options as well!"}
{"text":"Superfriendly staff and a terrific selection of teas from all over the world.  Decent prices - they laughed at me when I told them I shopped at Teavana at home.  Love the rows and rows of glass jars lining the walls.  Like an old-fashioned apothecary's shoppe.  If you are from out of town and buy something you like you can order refills on their website!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes crazy tea place you are crazy. it would have been a 5, but i got 'guilted' out of getting coffee when i was told I was ordering the last cup (after i relented, someone else just ordered after me). granted, it was Christmas Eve and people the employees wanted to go home.  The excitement about this place is evident from my mom's enthusiasm about the place as a tea expert. In the tea arena, i have seen no equal. The mustached tea guru who works there literally puts together the different teas - and has an intimate knowledge of each."}
{"text":"Yes! yES! yyes... So many teas Such helpful staff Super Reasonable prices Shipping available   I got a Golden Competition grade Pu-erh , organic pu-erh, some tochas and some flowering tea balls. All for $12.   Happy dance.   ((And they ship))"}
{"text":"Rows and rows and rows of coffee. It's pretty overwhelming for a non-coffee drinker. But if there's a wonderful staff, they will lead you in the right direction. In comes a coffee dude that was very knowledgeable and lead me to what sounded like a pretty tasty blend!  I was in shopping for a friend who loves pumpkin coffee, so I made a beeline for the coffee dude and said \"must. have. pumpkin.\" Thankfully he knew what I was saying and said he had this special \"harvest blend\" he mixes himself of cinnamon, hazelnut and pumpkin. Sounded and smelled delicious, so I trusted him.   I sauntered over to the tea wall and saw the many blends of loose leaf tea they have as well. That's my biznas right there! I noticed a Christmas blend that sounded amazing, but sadly they were sold out. Of course, a couple weeks before xmas that would happen! So I stocked up on some Vanilla Creme Stash tea and vowed to come back and take some time to dive into their tea selection.   For those Strip District wanderers, they have a full coffee bar as well that I'd trust is as awesome as their collection of beans and leaves. Tons of supplies for all your sipping needs are packed into this store as well. If you're a coffee or tea lover, this will be your jam. As the terminator would say, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful staff.  Great selection and convience of online orders are very helpful l."}
