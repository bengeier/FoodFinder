{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant with great staff and food. It looks like a fine dining restaurant but it's a place that you can go casual and fit in very nicely. The owner is a wonderful, kind and generous man. Please give them a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Corleone's this eve. The food was average at best and not worth the price. We definitely are foodies and we know real authentic and good Italian and this was not it. I got supposed milk fed veal and I know how tender that should have been.....I could hardly cut with a sharp knife! We spent over $100 and hardly got much for it. I am very disappointed and I will never go there again. The portions were average also but in this case that was ok because the food was not that good. One thing I will brag on is the beautiful plants on the patio, they must have a fantastic gardener. If you want fantastic Italian in the same are go to Vivo restaurante on Ridge rd. in Parma and Bruno's in Cleveland by W. 41st. is two outstanding places. You will get great food, large quantities and decent prices at the other places I mentioned."}
{"text":"Food was decent...sat in the bar area which was fine nothing too special. Tried a few of the happy hour apps since they were only 5 dollars. Got the calamari and the stuffed peppers both were ok nothing really special about either. I got the chicken Marsala and tried the chicken Parm nothing special about those either...just an all around ok place"}
{"text":"Delicious food, quiet and dim atmosphere with great prices. Perfect for a date, special occasion, or night out with friends."}
{"text":"Great appetizers, meal, wine, wait staff, bar staff...
Not so great:  the older lady seating people (hey, how about a smile? ever? and we've been there a lot!) and tiramisu (yeah I know, they say it's grandmother's recipe-umm no, definitely not home made)..."}
{"text":"Their gnocchi Capone dish is one of the best things anywhere and the ambiance is nice (in complete contrast to the rustic appearance of their old place).  The only down side is the sticker shock that may crop up when straying from the lunch/pasta menu."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite Italian restaurant and I'm stoked that it's close to the house. Made reservations prior and was seated immediately upon arrival. The staff were very welcoming and our server Cherise was a huge help in helping me narrow down my choice (Everything on the menu sounded amazing). The Italian Mac and Cheese was simply amazing! Unfortunately I didn't save room for desert, so I will be back soon for the Creme brûlée!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great wine list, amazing menu! I love the eggplant rollatini and my husband loves their lasagna so much he won't order anything else! My favorite italian restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much outside but this place is great.  The veal is to die for !!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good service. Everything we ordered was delicious, and the portions were generous. I had a few small plates...a huge meatball, angel hair with marinara, and macaroni and cheese. All were very good, and the mac and cheese was more like an Alfredo-type of sauce, but still yummy. My other half had the Chicken Carbonara, which was a huge portion. It was very rich and tasty. However, the bread with their dipping sauce full of freshly-grated Parmesan was absolutely addicting! Desserts were good, also. We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place was sooooo good, 5 stars are not enough. I'm from Denver, Co.  and needed a restaurant Wednesday evening and we found a great one. My wife had soup and salad and spaghetti, I had seafood and linguini and both were fantastic. The drinks were fast and excellent and the service was the same. Everyone in Cleveland should try the place."}
{"text":"Awesome food and portions. Very disappointed in the service-- there were two tables in the restaurant for lunch and it took us a very long time to get our drinks and to order. Other than that- very delicious authentic italian. Pretty decor."}
{"text":"Food was delicious from salad, soup to pasta and meatballs. Charity the bartender/waitress could not have been more welcoming! If you have not tried Corleone's, give it a try....you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Every plate of food that came out from the calamari to the veal plates, just  ...fantastic. 
Prices are pretty expensive but absolutely worth it. This was our first visit and we will be going back."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian spot. Great food and staff... try the eggplant parmesan,  yum! Great bar, in a strip mall but don't hold that against Corleones."}
{"text":"We went to Corleone's for dinner, expecting something pretty special from everything we'd heard. We are not picky people, but we were bitterly disappointed. The good news: pleasant, efficient service, fresh salad greens with tasty Italian dressing, warm bread, and good iced tea. The bad news: mediocre Italian wedding soup and uninspired marinara sauce. The worst news: We ordered the chicken piccata and the chicken marsala. Both had gummy breading. The chicken itself (in both orders) was difficult to cut, tough, and dry -- borderline inedible. The marsala sauce was passable, but the piccata sauce was virtually tasteless. The overall experience was definitely underwhelming, and we will not be returning to Corleone's. Ever."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time.  From the money walked in the two beautiful wood doors I knew I was in for a special treat. This is by far my favorite Italian restaurant I have ever been too! I had the mac and cheese which was absolutely delicious! Also great service too. Waitress checked in every 10 minutes or so and I didn't have to ask for more water. I remember seeing the piano man  Tom at the Cleveland Yacht Club many times before."}
{"text":"First time here.  Loved the patio,  however it was booked for a private party.  Nice, cozy inside.  I ordered the Linguini w/Meatball. Hubby had the Seafood special which was loaded with seafood.   Delicious.  My only complaint would be slow service.  Waitress was nice,  but we didn't even get our  bread until after we had our dinners. Also,  is really in a hidden spot.  I lived in Parma area  for years & never knew it existed. I will give it another try tho."}
{"text":"Best Italian food ever!! Great service!! If you want top of the line meal you must go here! Great for date night or anytime! My husband and I had our first date here, got engaged here, and will continue to keep coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place more than I did, but the flavor/taste of my dishes did not wow me, nor did they justify the price.

That place has an old school Italian feel, and for a random rainy Tuesday they were quite busy.

As a pasta expert, I went with their special Chicken Carbonara ($22), and then had to Caesar salad on the side.

Both were well portioned and made with fresh quality ingredients, however they seamed to be lacking an ingredient or two in the sauce/dressing department.

Bread was good and fresh and my beer was cold.  

Service was attentive and friendly.

Apparently the owner was sitting at the bar and struck up a conversation with two soldiers sitting by me.  He comped their meals and gave them free dessert, which I thought was a first class move.  

All in all, I would probably be back for all the great things they did, but food taste is the most important.  Maybe it was an off night, not sure."}
{"text":"My test for a good Italian restaurant is the pasta.  I had the Lasagna and it was perfect.  Piping hot, pasta perfectly al dente, and creamy.  The tasty marinara sauce went well w/ a medium bodied red wine.  

A peeve of mine at Italian restaurants is that I like the just warm bread and olive oil.  I don't need all the herbs, spices and tons of cheese in my olive oil.  If that's your thing, the mixture is good.  However, the olive oil just by itself is also excellent.  

Everything appears to be homemade and the fish is wild, not farm raised.  A very nice atmosphere as well.  Upscale, but casual.  Dimly lit, but enough light to see what you're eating.  A must the next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Meatballs as big as your head and tasty too. Ok so I exaggerated but you get it. Love their grilled salmon salad."}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere
They make great cocktails like a Cosmo. Fresh bread with olive oil dipping sauce was amazing. Had a combination of herbs & cheese- delicious. Shrimp cocktail was fresh & the margherita pizza flatbread was thin crispy and tasty. The eggplant rollitini was amazing- Got it with arabitta sauce to give a nice kick to it. Cannolis & creme brûlée were delicious and fresh. Great meal. Good service & nice wine selection"}
{"text":"This was our first visit.. . And we will definitely return. . The inside seemed pretty dark so we opted for the great patio. .  Perfect choice although just before we left another party sat down next to us and requested an ash tray. . We left before we would have been disappointed by the smoke. . 

The meal began with delicious warm bread and oil then crisp salad with homemade Italian dressing. . Yummy. Our server offered great suggestions for our entrees.. Portions are huge so we now have enough for tomorrow's dinner. ... Gnocchi,  lasagna,  meatballs,  and some chicken artichoke dish.  All were mouthwatering fantastic.  Great food,  service,  and atmosphere. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Went for the first time in Saturday night. First impression was not great due to the strip the restaurant was in, however, I was pleasantly surprised. 

I don't remember our servers name, however she did not give us the best impression. When asking for her suggestion, she couldn't really give us a straight answer, and when we did order, she made a face with every order...as if she did not like what we were choosing.

Salmon with asparagus was amazing & my ferencini was above average. 

Ambiance was relaxed and casual, noise level was below average which was nice. They did have a live band there, but I was glad they weren't playing the entire dinner.

Overall, good experience. I will definitely go there again but hopeful we have a different server to give us great recommendations!"}
{"text":"After eating our appetizer and then being served our salads we were informed that the lasagna we had ordered 35 minutes earlier was not available. This was at 630 on a Sunday evening. When we entered the restaurant there was not anyone in there. Seven tables seated after we came in most with reservations.  That combined with the lasagna being one of their top selections and recommend by the staff it would seem they should not run out of it. The server stated that the chef just told her after she \"dropped\" the salads. When we finally received our entrees the chicken marsala was bland. The spaghetti and meatball was good. The penna alla sicilliana was suppose to be spicy but was bland and the flat bread was overbaked. 

The dinner menu is at least a $$$ not the $$ that is shown on yelp.   

The server was nice but had too many tables to check back often enough. 

All in all I will find another Italian place the next time I am in Parma."}
{"text":"Corleone's, with its unassuming strip plaza location in Parma, already detracts from its appeal as a destination restaurant.  That said, our recent dining experience there was surprisingly decent, with a few caveats.

The interior of the restaurant features monochromatic elegance, with shades of gray, brown and black predominant.  Candlelit tables add an touch of warm ambiance, and subdued live music on Saturday evenings help to make the meal special.

However, as is the trend in restaurants these days, the space between tables is mere inches.  The lively bar, although beautifully appointed with back mirrors and wood shelving, added to the din.  Any hopes for a intimate dining experience are non-existent before at least 9pm on a weekend.  Fortunately, were arrived close to that time, and as the crowds waned, we were able to hear one another speak.

Our server greeted us with menus and an extensive wine list featuring European selections along with some Northeast Ohio vintages.  My partner ordered the house Chianti while I chose the Debonne Riesling.

For an appetizer, we decided on the calamari, one of our favorites.  Our server soon returned with what was obviously some kind of frozen, prepared product with a thick breading, accompanied by the standard marinara sauce on the side.  This would not have been a disappointment if we were dining at, say Denny's.  It just isn't what we expected at these price points.  

Dinners are accompanied by a salad and warm, crusty bread and a delicious slurry of Parmiggiano Reggiano and olive oil for dipping.  The bread was delicious and more than made up for the meager iceberg salad festooned with two grape tomatoes and several rings of onion.  Homemade Italian dressing is served on the side, which was a plus.

For our entrees, we both chose the Halibut with lobster sauce, which was one of the featured specials that evening.  My partner had originally ordered the Grouper, but was soon advised that it was unavailable.

Halibut is unfortunately, a fish that is quickly becoming depleted in the Atlantic, and I had my reservations about ordering it.  Besides the obvious sustainability factor, restaurants sometimes substitute cod or pollock for this fish.  My partner, however, is trained as a chef; he assured me when our dinners arrived that we were, indeed, eating halibut.

The fish was delicious, with a clean taste and a dense, firm texture.  We suspect the lobster sauce was not prepared in-house, but rather, canned. (the reasoning: since lobster was not offered on the menu, what would they have prepared the sauce from?)  The fish was accompanied by roasted wedges of potatoes, each topped with a sad-looking hothouse tomato.  Again, this would not have been surprising, had we been eating at a Perkins, etc.  Why not serve tomatoes in-season, when they are red and delicious from growing in natural sunlight?  

Throughout our dinner, the service was quite attentive and pleasant, and the host went out of her way to secure us a table on a Saturday evening with no reservation.

I suspect that Corleone's has some other winning items on their menu, which features many Italian specialties and a fine selection of steaks.  The prices range from eighteen to twenty dollars for standard pasta dishes, up to thirty plus for select steaks.  I would suggest giving them a try, but make your reservation for a warm summer weeknight to ensure fresh, in-season produce and a quiet atmosphere utilizing their outdoor patio."}
{"text":"First visit here. Sat on the patio which was very nice, although noise really travels and we could hear most people's conversations. Service was a bit slow, but that could be from the kitchen and not the server, who was very fun and outgoing. The food was good. There was only three options in the gluten-free menu section and the server wasn't knowledgeable at all on other GF options, which was a bit disappointing. I would definitely go again though."}
{"text":"I had a great time here! The staff were nice and very helpful! My waitress made suggestions and was patient with me during my first time there.

THE FOOD IS AMAZING!!! The bread is so warm and the dipping oil is truly something special!

I sat at a small table in the dining area. Very nice ambience! Kinda dark though unless you sit near the bar. Overall, a great experience! Perfect for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere down to every detail of the beautiful stone wall to decor. Service was on point! Food portions huge. Can't say enough about the food was above and beyond what I expected will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"What is it with great restaurants being found in unassuming strip malls in Parma?!  Located in the same lot as \"Ollie's Bargains,\" most people probably would not give this place a second glance... They definitely should!  

Everything about our dining experience was wonderful.  The waitress was incredibly friendly and motherly.  We never had to wait for a refill, fresh ground pepper, or cheese.  The atmosphere was perfect for date night... It was a little dark in the dining room and each table had a candle in the center.

The food was incredible!  I had Italian wedding soup to start with, and the broth was full of flavor!  I loved the meatballs in it as well and drained the whole bowl.  We also got a basket of fresh bread and oil with Parmesan cheese and spices mixed in... Superb!  For my meal, I ordered the \"Italian Mac and cheese\" and was not disappointed!  It was ooey and gooey and coved in 5 different kinds of cheese with some crunchy pancetta thrown in for good measure.  Absolutely scrumptious!  Bill ordered the chicken parm and was very happy too.  

The one tiny complaint I had was that the gift certificate we used that should have covered the entire meal and then some was not allowed to cover the tax.  That meant we had to leave $7 on the gift certificate in addition to paying the tax in cash.  Just beware of that! 

I'll definitely be returning and would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"This fine establishment immediately sets the tone as soon as you walk through the door. The interior is dimly lit with a romantic ambiance that permeates throughout the entire restaurant.  Now for the food, I sat at the bar and ordered the linguini marinara with mushrooms, which came with fresh baked bread, an olive oil dipping plate, and a house salad consisting of assorted greens with an Italian vinaigrette dressing.  The portions are quite plentiful and unless you have a ferocious appetite, you will likely be taking some home.  The wine selection is massive and there probably a couple hundred bottles lining the bar area; however, I opted for a $4.00 glass of Sangiovese.  Some things in life come can be ignored or swiftly forgotten, but the cuisine here certainly cannot!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure- I have not actually eaten here- BUT I really tried to!!! 

It was actually the restaurant staff who foiled my efforts from the get go and I think that speaks a lot about this place. 

My co-workers and I wanted to try here for lunch one day so we checked out their menu online. Lacking some information, my co-worker, Kym, called to have some questions answered.  The lady who answered couldn't answer them. She put Kym on hold - for a while- and when she came back, she still could not answer them. Really??? These were not tough questions. Things like \"does a salad come with your meal?\" or \"does the chicken entree come with pasta?\". She told us she was new and paused, like that was going to be it. Kym actually had to say \"Could you go get someone who can answer these questions?\" Again on hold for a while...

When the next person came back she answered the first two tough questions, but then proceeded to say a few other things that differed from their online menu. When Kym asked about these differences the lady on the phone seemed confused and told us the online menu was wrong. We then asked her if she could fax us a current menu. She said she would but that their fax was \"iffy.\" To no surprise, we never got a menu. Perhaps their food is decent, but this experience made us think twice. If these things are tough for them I don't think I can trust them with my lunch."}
{"text":"YUM!  What a delightful little find in a strip mall!  You'd never guess it would be so very nice from the outside, but you walk in, and it's quite lovely!

I came here with coworkers on a recent trip to Cleveland and they suggested this place, as it was a little bit out of the way and therefore much less likely to have a wait.  Sure enough, we were seated immediately.  Drink orders were taken quickly, and a plate with olive oil, herbs and parm was put out with some fresh bread.

I ordered the shrimp/scallop special, served in a tomato-wine sauce over linquine.  It was pretty tasty, although I have to say my coworkers' dishes all looked way better than mine.  And I only got TWO shrimps and TWO scallops.  Maybe it's just because it was lunch...but that seems a smidge stingy!

Anyhow, our server wasn't the most friendly girl, but she did her job.  And we were very well fed.  Definitely a little gem if you're ever in the Cleveland area.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Fine dining and an extensive wine selection can be found here. I stopped in for a late lunch or an early dinner and found a nice happy hour menu. Perfect portion, price and variety for my needs. My hotel room wasn't ready so so had about an hour to kill. Had Reisling, steak and shrimp with asparagus. The bread with oil, herbs and Parmesan cheese was very good. The food was delicious and the wine was ok. I would love to come back and enjoy happy hour again. They have a great location. Patio, bar area or dining room seating is available, very clean place  and everyone was friendly. They have wine for every palate and mixed drinks as well. I could honestly eat the bread and drink wine all night on the patio. This is a place I would recommend if you want wine, steak or pasta."}
{"text":"Had an early Monday dinner. Food was great & service was attentive. Live piano music @ 4:30 in the afternoon was a pleasant surprise"}
{"text":"Excellent early bird meals until 6p weekdays! Nice happy hour deals until 7p! 
Cocktail and wine delights, appetizers delish and entrees to ponder, ultimately great choices! 
Been coming here for 20 years and food is consistently delectable and delightful. 
Great, attentive staff and perfect martini bartender. 
Make it there!  Easily accessible form the City or Highway 480.  It may be in a strip mall, but it is inviting and cozy.  Come as you are attire."}
{"text":"The ambience is lovely and warm! The food wasn't too great! The house Italian salad and bread was our best from whatever we had ordered! A little bit of seasoning I believe would have gone a long way. We had ordered the chicken piccata which came drenched in butter with a hint of lemon in it (I would have preferred a more lemony taste to it). My husband ordered the meatball linguini marinara which was decent except it was missing a good amount of seasoning to it! Overall it's an \"okay\" place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  They offer a limited dinner menu.  I had the Veal Sinatra.  It was fabulous. Soft and tender with an amazing ricotta and spinach stuffing."}
{"text":"This was a few years ago and maybe things have gotten better.  Could of been the help at that time of their business, could of been an off night. Sure looks like it from the reviews but me and my spouse still talk about it.  It was an early Saturday eve and hardly anyone in there yet.  Everyone  recommended Corleone's and we went for our Anniversary.  
First of all I think two $$ is wrong!  For two people our bill with tip came too - $85.00.   I'm still mad I tipped the girl 18pc.  We had one drink each, 1 soup, 1 salad and dinner each, no dessert. 
Okay here goes...
We ordered a glass of wine and a beer.  My husband went to pour his bottle of beer in the glass and it had some gross junk on the side of the bottle. It looked like dried throw up on it.   Sent it back and he went to wash his hands.  She brought another bottle of beer-  never apologized and this one had the same gross residue on it!  Went with a tap beer.  Hubby got the swordfish blackened it was the special for the evening.  Since it's so dark in there by candlelight couldn't see that it was raw in the middle.  By the way since it was dark and hard to see that is why you didn't see gunk on the side of the bottle too.  At that point we just wanted to take our doggie bags home and reheat.  
Plus only 3 couples in there at the time and she sat us right next to the other couple.  I have had people invite us to join them at Corleone's  and I just say nope have fun.   The waitress should of comp something or at least be mortified... nope could care less.   Like I said I am still mad I tipped her 18 pc.   She didn't deserve 15."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are always on point. Every time we go our \"usual\" favorites always taste as they should and are so dependable. Service is good, workers friendly, and overall we always have a great experience. I always cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I picked this spot based on reviews here on Yelp and on OpenTable - Hubs and I were both pleased with the choice.

We started with a nicely sized Caprese salad. Hubs had Chicken Parmesan and I had Chicken Picatta, with a side of aglio e olio pasta instead of the regular marinara. I tried and enjoyed both. 

Our server was also very attentive and so sweet. The only downside is that the smaller side room we were seated in became quite loud when it filled up. 

The bar area looked very cute, and they have a pretty good wine selection. I have driven past this place many times, and would have skipped it yet again if I hadn't read the other reviews first. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 stars at all so this is my highest rating! If you weren't looking for it you probably wouldn't know this is one of the best Italian restaurants in the Cleveland area. Owner is a great guy and seems to always be there. Great wine selection. Great service. All of the Italian dishes are great but their seafood really shines! 

Price rating is for entre costs. Add in an app, wine or cocktails and dessert and you will have a great time but could easily run 60-70 each."}
{"text":"Five star Lasagna. Just enough spinach and sauce. Cheese layer was super creamy, I could almost swear it was cream cheese and ricotta together. Portion sizes at this restaurant are ridiculously big. The lasagna was so large, we seriously took half home and each ate it for dinner the next day. It was lovely.

We also got the chicken marsala. It was nice, very similar to something I could make at home, but still lovely. Delicious, lightly breaded, juicy chicken, large mushrooms and a light sauce. Came with a side of pasta & marinara sauce in a curved bowl.

We started the meal with hot bread (free) which comes with oil and heavy dose of grated parmesean cheese and spices. Different but good. We tried their award winning scallops appetizer. It was tasty, but very surprisingly sweet with a raspberry dressing. Scallops perfectly cooked.

A nice interior but a bit crowded. Tables are close enough together you can hear every word of the next party's conversation. It is actually hard to get in/out of your seat without bumping the next table. Oh and it is in a very unassuming strip mall in Parma."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere and very good food and service. Large portions and good pours as well!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Don't let the location or neighbors in the strip mall fool you.  This is a world class italian restaurant.  Great local beer and wine lists, huge menu, and reasonable prices make it a winner.  This is quite literally my all time favorite restaurant, and I only get to the state once in awhile on business.  Give it a shot.  I recommend the baked penne marinara with meatballs, but have them throw alfredo sauce in with it as well.  Fantastic.  This is also where I found the first beer I actually liked, a local beer ,called bed head red.  Unfortunately, its been taken off the menu now.

It's a darker, more intimate/upscale looking place inside, but I've worn jeans before and never got a sideways look."}
{"text":"In town on business. Went to Corleone's for dinner tonight and not only was the staff very friendly and efficient, the food was outstanding. I had the Chicken Broccolini and the creamy garlic Alfredo sauce was the best I have tasted. The penne pasta was just perfect. I thought the pricing was fair and our server made the visit memorable enough I had to take the time to write a review. 

I will return, without a doubt!!!"}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow to start with. Place was virtually empty and we did not get our bread for 20 minutes(not lying).  Overall after we were served the foor was good, but not great.   This place needs a overhaul to become relevant again."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! Ordered on Uber eats and they forgot part of my order.. I tried calling 3 times to talk with someone about it, each time they took my name and number, but then no one returned my call. Food isn't that great either! By looking at other reviews, they apparently have issues with how to treat customers."}
{"text":"I visit Cleveland once a month, last month I stopped in here for the first time month and it happened to be Valentine's Day and they were slammed, so I gave them a pass on the bad service (sitting at the bar).  Tonight, a Monday night and they are very business with 1 server behind the bar.  She is working hard just not enough help.    After she served me a drink, I had to flag her down for a menu and then againto order.   
My salad was good, they have a very good Italian dressing and their bread and dipping oil/Parmesan cheese is delicious.  
I had the Ferecini which was very tasty, a ton of seafood in there!
Nice place, they just need help behind the bar."}
{"text":"Rating one star as this restaurant made me horribly ill after dining during a lunch service in October of 2017.  Given how sick I became from eating here, any redeeming qualities of this particular establishment are lost on me."}
{"text":"I can't believe I forgot to review this place with how often we have eaten here plus the fact that it was the very first place we decided to try upon moving to Cleveland. It's kinda pricey BUT in exchange the give you good food and good service. Kind of a rarity in Cleveland to be paying high prices and then actually get something pleasant and edible in return. Just my opinion so far... I know I haven't tried everything yet.

Sometimes they even send out coupons in the mail to the locals here in Parma for a two for one dinner which makes it a five star experience in my book. So yeah I'd say if the seating inside was a little more spacious, if the prices were a tad bit lower, and if the deserts were any good it would be five stars.

Try their Grilled Chicken Alfredo. Simply delicious."}
{"text":"I love this place. The service can be hit or miss, ranging from \"Geez its kinda slow, huh?\" to \"as good as you would expect at any place\". Its never bad service, it just seems like sometimes the wait staff would benefit from a redbull, that's all. The food is excellent! I highly recommend the Italian wedding soup. Ill sometimes stop in and get the soup to go, to add to a meal I'm cooking at home. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was so surprising. Had the Luciano. It was amazing. The sauce on the chicken was so full of flavor I wish it would have been on my pasta and the pasta was so fresh. Do yourself a favor and try this place at least once. I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Found this recommendation on Yelp.  It is a little out of the way gem.  Food and service were great.  We have a child with a gluten allergy and they changed a meal to meet her needs as well.   Great night out out."}
{"text":"I called to make reservations for my wedding anniversary.  When calling day of, they lost the reservations forcing us to scramble to find an alternate."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Reasonable prices. The small salads with your meals are just ok...fresh and meet expectations. The three meals at our table all seemed quite authentic and were well porportioned with good flavors and good presentation - some flare but still on the homestyle side. The bread with dinner was good. The cheese in the olive oil served with it was just a little too strong...but still good...it just kind of overpowered good bread. Good wine and beer lists. Service was good. One minor compaint - salads, bread and app all came out at once and then it seemed like we waited for a fairly long time for the meals. In the end, worth the wait. Still, a very good italian choice. I would go back."}
{"text":"Corleone's is SUCH an overlooked place, so much so that I completely forgot they existed. I had been here a couple times as a child with my grandmother and didn't give them a second thought until someone recommended them when I was looking for a nice, but low-key restaurant to celebrate an anniversary on a weekday. 

Corleone's met and exceeded every expectation and really made this a special meal for us! Even though it was late in the season, and a bit damp outside, they accommodated our request for the patio -- which is absolutely outstanding and definitely does a spectacular job of making you forget you're in a strip mall in Parma. They really did a spectacular job of making the atmosphere out there. Our server was so pleasant and definitely went above and beyond with little things like lighting a fire for us. 

And of course the food! The food was phenomenal. We started out with the flatbread appetizer, which is really just a thin crust pizza, but a very good one. For the main course we both opted for the NY strip steaks, which were not only a great portion for the price but much more importantly absolutely delicious. 

This is definitely a great restaurant for a special occasion, but if you're not getting the steaks it also seems like a great place to just grab a bite in general. They have live music on certain nights, and play on the patio during the summer, which is definitely something I want to go back and check out. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"4.5

Really like this place.  Head here after work a time or two when in town.  Have also had dinner and it is always good.

For me, Corleone's is a great neighborhood restaurant/bar.  Friendly faces, good service, consistency, better on the inside than the outside.

For me, this is one of the great stuffed peppers in the Cleveland area.  Right amount of spice, great sausage filling, not over cooked or over dressed.

Had the thin crust pizzas on the last trip, love the crust and topping.  Could have been a touch crispier but the amount of toppings softened the super thin crust.

Come for cocktails, stay for dinner.  Great gem in Parma."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for dinner. Our waiter, John, was excellent. He made us feel welcome and was always on hand when needed. He knew the menu well and directed us to delicious seafood entrees and appetizers. This was an impromptu visit and our first but we will definitely return again."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately. Our waitress was very nice but took forever to check up on us. They were a bit busy that day so I'm guessing she may have forgotten about us since we had to ask a different waitress for assistance. The food was very delicious but a bit expensive. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a quite atmosphere to take their date to. If you're feeling for some authentic Italian food, this is your place. Lastly, parking is highly accessible."}
{"text":"I'm quite conflicted on how to review Corleone's. The food was truly some of the best Italian food I have ever had. The eggplant rollatini was to die for. I have been thinking about it since our dinner last week!! Portion sizes are HUGE, and prices are extremely reasonable for the quality and the amount of food. Margarhita flatbread was the perfect start to the meal. We tried a few bites of the calamari - perfect. Each entree comes with a house salad. The food is extremely good, truly one of the more authentic Italian restaurants in Cleveland.

The problem was the service. It was so terrible. We had reservations for 7:30, we didn't even get seated for 45 minutes. Multiple people who walked in were sat before us. They admitted they had forgotten about us. Strike one. From there, the food took way too long to come out. We were only a table of 4. We had to flag down the waiter multiple times to get him to come over to our table. But... the food was so good and so reasonably priced. It's close to my house so we're planning on giving it the benefit of the doubt, and try it again on a weeknight or a little earlier on a weekend night. Hoping for better service!!"}
{"text":"We tried Corleone's for the first time this past weekend for our anniversary dinner.  We really enjoyed it and were so pleasantly surprised.  The interior is very nice and provides a nice quiet romantic setting (When the head chef isn't telling a story and dropping the F-bomb like it's going out of style).  The conduct of the head chef was fairly disappointing but we didn't let it ruin our meals.

The salad was fairly basic, but good.  The bread/oil combination was AMAZING.  Crunchy outside and chewy inside bread that was piping hot and fresh.  Bruschetta was different but good.  I had the chicken Luciano and wife had pasta and meatballs.  The meatballs had to have been 1 pound each.  Normally a serving that large sacrifices quality and taste, but these didn't.

All in all a good dinner."}
{"text":"Food is great but the atmosphere is ruined by the poor attitude of the staff. Busy on there phones, don't seem to care about their time with the guests."}
{"text":"Since I had to be in Ohio, I figured I'd try to find a nice restaurant to make me forget where I was. This place did the trick from the minute I walked in. Warm and cozy atmosphere, people laughing at the bar, partaking in a wine tasting and having a good time.

The cute bartender/ waitress suggested the peppercorn steak dish they had. She also suggested that I order it with \"light peppercorns,\" since the chef usually overdid it. I can only imagine how much pepper would be on the thing had I not ordered it \"light.\"

While I was eating, one of the people at the bar turned around and asked me how I liked my steak. I sarcastically told him that it was a little peppery. He came right over to our table and started telling us how much he, too, loved pepper. I'm not quite sure he picked up on my tone. I mean, I literally had a mouthful of peppercorns with my first bite. I then made a big pile of peppercorns on my plate- far, far away from my steak, which was slightly overcooked, but acceptable.

So, it turns out that he is the owner of the place. Nice guy, and he even offered us a great glass of wine on the house. He stuck around for about ten minutes, and he discussed with us his hopes for Cleveland, and he told us about another restaurant he owned. He also introduced us to his bartender, who is his daughter. Very friendly people.

All in all, the atmosphere was great and the owner is a great guy. But my steak was way too peppery- yes, even for peppercorn steak. The prices were slightly high, but not outrageous.

I'll definitely eat here again, and maybe even see the rest of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fine Italian dining in a strip mall setting.  Nice, quiet dark wood decor.  Small menu, heavy on seafood choices.  Everything seemed quite fresh. Extensive wine list.  Steak w/ béarnaise sauce was delicious.  Recommended for a quiet evening out."}
{"text":"I came to Cleveland to visit my Mom and took her to dinner here tonight expecting a good to great meal from the other Yelp reviews.
I'm not sure where to begin with this place.
First of all, the $$ pricing guideline that the first reviewer gave this place is insane ! The designation of $$ is $11 to $30 per person if you follow the Yelp guidelines. The lowest priced entree here is $16, for a plate of pasta with marinara sauce. A steak is $36 to $40 !! Veal is $26 to $34. Bottom line is that unless you want a very simple pasta the average entree is around $30. So how this place gets $$ for price is a mystery to me.
Now to the service...
Service: The waitress was pleasant enough, but they really should teach the  wait staff to pronounce the dishes ! Poor girl butchered every other word. \"Gnocchi\" didn't even sound like a word. We didn't get the olive oil and bread while the table next to us who came in 15 minutes later than us got it fairly quick. When I asked for it, I was told they usually bring the bread after the appetizer. Huh ? OK, whatever. When she took  our appetizer plates, she took our forks as well. I asked three times for more forks. Once before the entrees came, twice after. Lastly, the waitress had a laugh that would scare a hyena, and she likes to laugh alot. Not relaxing.
Food ??:
Not great. I was hoping to make up for the rest of the experience with the food, but it wasn't happening. They have a big selection of veal dishes, four or five steak choices and some pasta dishes. We got the \"Mariana\" appetizer that won some kind of award according to the menu. It was scallops with risotto ($12). The Scallops were cooked perfect, although small. The risotto was good, not great - pretty unremarkable. Overall, the best thing we ate all night. For entrees, I had the Linguine with meatballs, al dente requested. The sauce was boring and the meatballs were literally the size of baseballs - and they were NOT good. I won't go into detail, but they were big balls of meat with very little flavor. The only bright point is that the pasta was cooked al dente, which doesn't matter much when you don't eat more than a third of it. My Mom got the Veal Sinatra. It has spinach and cheese on it with Marinara over the top. It was overcooked, and mucked-up by all the stuff on top. Just too much going on there. $26.
OK, does this guy have NOTHING good to say about this place ? Well, yes. The interior was decorated very nice, great bar, and the outside where we sat is very interesting. They had several very large pictures on the outside wall. Very cool decor.
One thing we noticed is that there were seemingly no people with Italian heritage dining at this place (except us). Maybe that, along with the fact that there are no really great Italian restaurants in the area, is the reason why this place got some good reviews -- nothing good to compare it to. Most of my reviews are 4 or 5 stars. I'm not someone that goes out with the intent of finding fault. In fact I was really hoping this would be a great dinner as I wanted to show my Mom a great time.
Dinner for two with one app and one beer each, no desert or coffee -- $68 before tip. Bottom line is that if I'm going to pay that kind of money for two entrees, one app, and 2 beers, I do expect it to be something remarkable. This was remarkable for the wrong reasons."}
{"text":"I travelled to town and was not familiar with Corleone's. I'm so happy I found it and decided to give it a try!  Wonderful food, nice atmosphere, and excellent service. Everyone had a smile on their face and they were very pleasant. It was so good I went back twice during the week I was in town."}
{"text":"This was our 1st time dining here.  The wife and I enjoyed our wine and the meal.  The atmosphere in the bar with the music made it an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"What can I say?  This was delicious!  I had an early dinner of Penna alla Vodka with some chicken thrown in. Everything was fabulous from the salad to the main dish. And the bread and dipping sauce....oh heaven shall be filled with that mixture!  Malory was my server, and she was as delightful as the meal!  She was genuinely giddy over how much I enjoyed the food. It was like we celebrated together. I'd come back here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I was excited when my family decided to take me to Corleone's for my birthday. I've always enjoyed my experiences there. Unfortunately this time was not good. The service took away from the meal and left a bad taste in our mouths. We had to repeatedly ask for our server, Marty, any time we needed something. She'd come out when it was time to deliver courses and then disappear, never delivering the things we asked for. No one should have to ask for more water 4 times!  When she came to deliver our main course, not a single plate had been cleared. When I asked her if she could clear our dirty plates, she began picking them up and slamming them down on the empty table next to us, obviously annoyed. When my meal came out incorrectly, there was never an apology or kind word. She just took the plate and walked away. My Liza, a chicken dish encrusted in pine nuts and with an asiago cream sauce was delicious, but the service made it tough to enjoy.  For a slightly pricier restaurant, chicken dishes ranged from approximately $18-$28, I expected better service. What a disappointing birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Cheese Lasagna- the best ever! The meal was amazing. If you don't know where you are going, make sure you use your GPS. This is hard to find and in a retail center."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough...This is not your typical Parma stopping ground...it's a little classier...

The wine selection was good and our server/ bartender was very helpful in our drink decisions since she helped create the wine list and did not steer us in the wrong direction.

I appreciated how they added parmesan cheese to the olive oil served with the bread...nice touch.

And our meals were great...eggplant appetizer was wonderful as was their chicken parmesan."}
{"text":"This Italian place looks deceiving from the outside due to it being in a plaza but great food on the inside. They have a happy hour with appetizer and drink specials. Also have had pasta there that was very good. Their bread and oil is also very good. Love the outdoor seating option makes you feel like your on vacation."}
{"text":"I wish I could elaborate, but this place has amazing Italian food and great service. JUST GO...You won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"No words can express how amazing this place is. From pizza to the eggplant parmigiana. They put so much love in the food and it shows. I'm so happy I dined here. I traveled from California and I will do it again in a flash to eat here! 

Thank you for a great memory!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Awesome lunch menu too! The place is family owned and they are great. From getting standard pasta and meatball to their specials, it's all great. The service is good and like I said, lunch menu is updated recently and awesome."}
{"text":"Take this review with the grain of salt that it was on New Year's Eve, a particularly busy night and also probably prone to workers calling in.  

We had a party of 10 for dinner, and were very clearly told that our reservation time needed to be prompt and that there was a two hour limit.  For a 5:30 reservation, no problem, we can handle that.  Everyone was there and hung out at the bar.  Pretty tight quarters to start with, and every single server and bartender who had to pass us gave our party a dirty look and an eye roll.  It's not really our fault that they set up the pianist in the way of their traffic flow, and we did our best to get small.  Not a huge deal, but slightly irritating.

We were finally seated at 6:40. Took forever for appetizers to come out, took another forever for bread to come out after that, and even longer for the food to finally come out.  Had to ask for small plates for the bread multiple times, and  for water refills multiple times.  And every one of these requests was met with an eye roll.  Any of these huge deals?  Nope.  But, when entrees are running $25-40 each, you expect a pretty high bar of service. And there were enough of these shortcomings strung together to really damper the experience.  

That said the food was completely delicious.  Everyone enjoyed the calamari appetizer, the \"Gotti\" was popular at our table and fantastic, and the steak and seabass were great.  It's refreshing to see a menu where you're really torn between several entrees.

By the time we wrapped up our meal (9pm) the place was full of people who had been waiting because the reservations were running behind and the service and food had been so slow to come out.  Again, take this with the perspective that it was New Year's Eve, but it wasn't a great showing.  It looked like a lot of folks chose to leave rather than wait.

Tend to believe that overall rankings for restaurants are a combination of food, price, service, and ambiance.  Corleone's does great by food and ambiance, but it is overpriced and the service was substandard for regular prices, let alone high-end fare."}
{"text":"Went for the first time for lunch yesterday. We pulled up and were a little apprehensive because it's not located in the nicest plaza. Luckily, our experience was a lot better than we expected. 

The service was wonderful. The hostess made sure we had water and immediately offered to grab any other drinks. Our waitress, Pam, was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. She offered several suggestions and had a great sense of humor. 

We started with Sausage and peppers -- they were delicious. The bread and oil was amazing, as well. For the main course I ordered a chicken penne pasta that was a special for the day and my husband ordered the Sinatra. Every bite of our meal was perfect. 

We drove 30 mins and passed numerous other Italian restaurants on the way. None are as good as the meal we had here. I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Definitely not what you'd expect to find in a strip mall in Parma. The food and service is pretty good, but I felt it was a little over priced - no more so than any other Italian restaurants in Cleveland.

The menu is pretty traditional, slightly more upscale than Olive Garden and not as modern as Macaroni Grill. If you're out for Italian food in Parma, skip Olive Garden and Stancato's and check out Corleones."}
