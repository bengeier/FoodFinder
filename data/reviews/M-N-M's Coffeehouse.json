{"text":"Favorite local coffee shop. Have tried nearly everything (coffee, tea, smoothies & food) on the menu and have enjoyed it all. Comfortable setting, friendly staff, well priced, high quality. Daughters enjoy the smoothies, food & ice cream as well. Wifi. Couches & soft chairs around fireplace settings. Back room for meetings or small gatherings. Never feel rushed to leave on the days I need to work out of the office."}
{"text":"Friendly people, great coffee and relaxing atmosphere. For food they have a tasty looking menu-I've had a blueberry muffin so far and it was yummy! I also like the music they play:) I would recommend swinging by if your in town!!:)"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by today for lunch. He had the Chelsey Special (grilled chicken, bacon, tomato, spinach, provolone cheese, ranch dressing on grilled sourdough bread).  I had the Sun Dried Tomato Turkey Wrap (sliced turkey lunch meat, provolone cheese, hummus, tomato, spinach in an herb wrap).  Really delicious and fresh!  I also got an iced latte that had bold, smooth espresso.  The new location is nice and spacious, with a relaxing, casual atmosphere.  There is plenty of seating--about 7 or 8 tables that eachseat 2-7 people, a few couches near a gas fireplace, two counters with stool seats, and two enclosed rooms with tables for meeting or quiet time.  Overall, I would highly recommend M-N-M's Coffee House as a wonderful local place to relax and have some delicious food and coffee."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, great food and spacious interior.  What more could you possibly want?  We are very lucky to have MNM coffee in Waunakee.  If you haven't tried their Breakfast burrito wrap, go now!  Pancake breakfast is perfect for kids to split and Taste great.  5 stars."}
{"text":"Their breakfast sandwiches on a croissant are delicious and my favorite coffee is the white chocolate mocha with a shot of raspberry."}
{"text":"Best small town coffee shop in the area.  Family owned and friendly.  Oh, the coffee and breakfast is great too!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff, great vibe! Y'all killing the breakfast-game around Waunakee!!"}
{"text":"Even though we got there before close (15 min) we were denied service because they shut down the grill. This was in the afternoon.   The girls behind the counter were rude so we left and went elsewhere. Had the service been better, we would've given it another chance. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Awesome! Love the seasonal latte flavors and everything we've had to eat there was very good. It's not fancy but the coffee is outstanding, staff is very friendly and the inside is very comfortable."}
{"text":"Great local place with tasty coffee and food. Comfortable and varied seating. Good place to meet friends, read, craft, etc."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Sometimes the people behind the counter are nice, and sometimes it takes them an eternity to even say hi. I stood at the counter for nearly 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. And no, they weren't swamped.   I had the tuna sandwich. Nothing special. It's over priced and you can make it at home.   Their breakfast sandwich on a croissant was really good though. And I like their blended coffees. That's why they get 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"Best coffee house in the area. Locally owned with responsive employees. This is also a great place for breakfast, lunch, or ice cream!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop was perfect! I love that there's an assortment of coffees to choose from, and the food was also great. The atmosphere was welcoming - I love sitting next to a cozy fireplace! I'll absolutely be back."}
{"text":"It's always nice and cozy inside you are always treated with a friendly smile when you walk through the door!"}
{"text":"This is a neat little place. Very popular with the Waunakee moms. Spacious, airy, it's the kind of place you can meet with friends or clients and never worry that the waitstaff is going to give you the evil eye for overstaying your welcome. Many different coffee choices, as well as light snacks and other beverages."}
{"text":"Passing through town hungry around lunchtime.  This place was far better than we expected in this small town.  Breakfast and lunch items at reasonable prices.  Nice atmosphere.  Good coffee."}
{"text":"Cutest place to hang out and read, work, or chat. Love the rustic tables and chairs! Yummy coffee drinks, too!"}
{"text":"I love visiting local coffee shops so I definitely had to check this place out. From the outside, like almost everyone else here already stated, you probably won't expect much. However, once inside, I was pleased with both the service and the coffee. Parking is somewhat limited for their busy times, but overall I had a good experience here."}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write an updated review about MNM's. My opinion has changed since my original review.  I've been to MNM's now a handful of times, and all experiences have been lackluster. I've reached for salt/pepper during my last few visits because my breakfasts have been incredibly bland. Most recently, my \"grilled veggie\" breakfast sandwich was so dry that it was almost inedible. The sandwich was on dry toast and included a dried/fried egg, one slice of tomato, one slice of provolone cheese barely melted, and four spinach leaves. No sauce. In my opinion, this was more or less toast with some unexciting things -- not a sandwich.  The service also has not been very good during my past few visits. The staff people, who all seem to be college-age girls (I sound so old! I'm only 30) are not friendly and not welcoming. I receive the same negative/angry vibe from the girl ordering behind the counter to the girl bringing food out to my table.   I don't think I'll visit MNM's for a while. I've visited a handful of times over the course of a few months, and those visits have been disappointing."}
{"text":"M-N-M's is basically the only place in Waunakee to grab something \"healthy\" to eat. The service is very slow, 15-20 minute wait times. You may have to remind them of your order if you've been waiting more than 15 minutes, it's likely the ticket never made it to the cooks. There aren't many vegan options, you'll have to create your own concoction."}
{"text":"This is the cute coffee shop a cute town like Waunakee needs! It's not in the adorable, but mostly vacant downtown, but in a strip mall past the round-about, but don't let the outside fool you.  The atmosphere is cozy, lots of ladies of different ages chatting or working, when I was there. There is even an enclosed play room for kids to keep nose down.  Coffee is  from Collectivo (everyone had their own feelings on this - I am underwhelmed), but the quiche was tasty, and there is a lot of seating, without feeling crowded.  Best place to hang out in Waunakee."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood coffee shop and I've only been here twice...what is wrong with me?! This place is amazing and SO unexpected. Don't let the somewhat boring exterior deter you from going in! Cozy, modern, comfortable...everything you'd expect for a good coffee shop awaits you inside And yes, a fireplace!! I had one of their pesto type sandwiches on gluten free bread the first time I went and it was VERY good, better than I'd expect for a coffee joint. This past time I was there I got their pumpkin spice latte with soy, and I loved it. It wasn't too sweet like you sometimes get at larger chains. I love that they have outdoor seating as well, and that they use Colectivo. Reminding myself now to go back often...!"}
{"text":"Coffeehouse still had Xmas decorations up. Ordered coffee, a super delicious lemon poppy seed muffin and a very bland chicken salad. The tables were not clean. I removed hair from the salt and pepper shakers. We waited 15 minutes for the wrong latte and almost 30 minutes for the bland cold sandwich."}
{"text":"Surprisingly charming. From the outside, this place does not look very inviting. The parking lot could be a little bigger.   However, when you step inside, it is warm and cozy. There are several types of seating options. A faux fireplace, a counter, a reading nook and family style seating.   The service was wonderful. It was my first time there and I had LOTS of questions. I ended up trying the house specialty Chelsey sandwich. For $7.50, I got a bowl of soup and half a sandwich. The \"half\" was easily a WHOLE. The sandwich was delicious. Hot, fresh and flavorful. I am not 100% sure what was in it. Chicken? Cheese? Spinach? Delicious goodness? Yes and yes and yes and yes.   I definitely plan to return."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food at M-N-M's. Serving size is great (especially the pancake special they always seem to have). The coffee drinks have been hit or miss however. Our lattes have often had a burnt flavor. The atmosphere is nice, but the kid's area and the bathrooms need a good cleaning."}
{"text":"I had the breakfast burrito and it was very good. My girls had muffins - we all liked the lemon poppy seed better than the chocolate chip. Nice selection of brewed coffees and the inside is really cute. It's a lot bigger inside than it looks outside."}
{"text":"Great  local place &  their food that's homemade   is quite good. They just seem to try a bit harder than the chain places and their coffee is just as good if not better."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, coffee and a fun staff make M-N-Ms my new favorite coffee shop!  Many flavors and types of coffee to chose from.  Updated: 27 Dec - I tried the Black and Tan blend this morning.  Yum.  Smooth, bold goodness.  Who'd a thought?"}
{"text":"I dropped by the opening of M-N-M's new location and came away impressed.  They converted what was an old water softener manufacturing plant into a cozy space for finishing a work project or catching up with friends over coffee.  Things I like: * There are four or five varieties of Colectivo coffee to chose from, always served hot and fresh.  Bags of whole beans are available as well for the DIY crowd. * Free refills * Counter staff are super friendly, whether you are a regular or infrequent patron. * The fireplace, with a sofa and comfy chair strategically placed nearby. * The tables are not densely packed, allowing you to have a conversation with your tablemate and not the neighboring tables. * Chocolate Shoppe ice cream * Free, fast wi-fi (but you'll need to ask for the password)  Things I don't: * The baked goods are lackluster.  The scones are far too soft - no exterior crust to provide contrast.  (Note to self:  Try to foster a strategic partnership with Batch or 4&20 or Bloom to import their baked goods into Waunakee.) * Their hours change seasonally, leading to an occasional unfruitful ice cream or caffeine run.  The customer loyalty program is through Belly - twenty visits gets you a free coffee.  M-N-Ms also has a light breakfast and lunch menu, but those items did not factor into my rating.  Kudos to M-N-Ms for converting the old Hellenbrand Water storefront into a great gathering spot for the community."}
{"text":"Love coming!!  Great breakfast options! Coffee is always hot and good! The kids love coming for the play area and IceCream!!"}
{"text":"Great for quick stops to-go, staying a while, and group orders for the office! I have experienced all three here and have never been let down.   Early mornings are an especially nice time to stop in because there is always a group or two of Waunakee locals, possibly retired, possibly just start their days a little later, but it just speaks to the friendly atmosphere and small town feel.  The service is consistently friendly and prompt and all the food and drink items I've tried have been great. Expect to pay a little more than you would at some of your other options in Waunakee for a morning beverage but it's worth it considering it's a family run, local restaurant that is welcoming and cozy.   The group order is where they exceeded my already positive experiences! I recently placed an office order for 15 people. I called a couple of days ahead of time to give plenty of advance notice, emailed in my order and set the pickup time. When I arrived, the order was ready to go, they had labeled everyone's names on their order like I asked, and most importantly, the entire order was correct. There is nothing worse than dealing with group order discrepancies! They even had the order sheet printed off and with my order so I could easily check everything, and their own checkmarks were already on there so it was extra reassuring to see they already double checked."}
{"text":"Good place to meet friends for a chat over coffee, for breakfast or lunch. Staff is friendly, coffee, lattes, etc., excellent, usually three types of quiche available. Nice atmosphere with tables, couches, easy chairs around a fireplace, separate room off the main dining area for a group of 6-8 also available"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwiches and coffee.  I always get a latte and they do a great job making it.  Service is fast and workers are nice. Plenty of seating for a coffee house and even a small room with a few toys for small children to play in.  The atmosphere is mostly farmhouse making it cozy, cute, and relaxing all at once.  This is a nice place to meet up with a friend group or have a business meet up with a coworker."}
{"text":"Don't let the plain exterior discourage you.  The inside of the shop is cute and well-laid out.  The scones looked great and coffee bar smelled amazing.  As a bonus there's an adorable play room for kids.  The restaurant was pretty crowded for a Thursday morning, however there is also very little competition in Waunakee.  There's also a good selection of yummy looking real ice cream.  If you want a cute place to meet up for coffee, it works.  If you want a real meal for breakfast or lunch you'll have to keep traveling.  Parking is fairly limited, but since it's not a large place it suffices.  And there's street parking next to the building available if needed."}
{"text":"Weird hours.  Always closed when I want to grab a cup of coffee or study/ work on my laptop. Or always closing and I find myself having to leave prematurely.  As s result haven't been back. Comfortably, homey ambiance."}
