{"text":"Has superb service and food. First time going here was a pleasure and I enjoyed the atmosphere there very much.

The only reason why 4 stars are given in this review is due to smaller portions of food for a more than \"above average\" price. Other than that, this place is dope!

Recommended for everything else!!!"}
{"text":"We were old customers happy with original owners. New guy named Fahad was very disrespectful, arrogant. No washrooms were working, our order was not available, we changed the order but didn't get it even after waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Ask the guy Fahad about our order, he told us to leave. Never going back. If a business can't respect customer doesn't deserve to get customers. Terrible and horrifying experience."}
{"text":"Raja Foods had the best butter chicken and the best papri chaat in the whole world. That is what I claimed for the past three years. The staff attempted to give good customer service, it still lacked but my love for their butter chicken and papri chaat still dragged me back often. I brought friends who had stopped going because of the shady shisha bar environment, not fit for a family. Recently, they expanded to have a family side away from the smoke filled Shisha side. That is why last week I called and made reservations for 9 people. They confirmed said everything was set for 6 on April 20th. Today, I showed up with my party, only to find hand written sign in the door way saying \"We are closing at 3 pm today, sorry for any inconvenience.\" 
It was a very embarrassing experience in front of your guests, that the restaurant you raved about and were a loyal customer to ignored your reservation without even a phone call. 
I give it 0 stars out of 5 on customer service. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food and shisha place with ambience.

Been goin here the past two years and have found the Food to be great tasting and consistent...

service, as with any desi place is inconsistent but we find it is better during dinner time when the younger crowd does a great job looking after everyone with much enthusiasm.

Shisha is also available with many flavours to choose from.

They serve Halwa puri breakfast on the weekends and it's certainly worth the wait and can see why many say it is the best in town.

Dinnner dishes we tried have all been delicious and worth trying over and over again. Prawn curry, malai chicken and biryani is the usual with tikka and kababs from time to time as well. 

Ask for what board games you can play...usual have cards or ludo on hand to play with your table."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service. Try the butter chicken or kebab donair - it will blow your mind. Sheesha is high quality with lots of choice and not rickety hookahs"}
{"text":"Yummy food! I love the Biryani here, and the customer service is always on point. Friendly place and great energy. 

Please Note: This is just not a restaurant. You can also go to smoke hookah if that is your thing. I don't smoke, but I noticed when I go in there the smoke from the hookahs doesn't disturb me, and make want to run away from it like cigarettes and all to the opposite side. or make me cough when I wait for the food. I was told because there is no tobacco in it as it a fruit blend."}
{"text":"I would love to be able to rate this restaurant properly, but I am too frustrated trying to find a menu to be able to order. There is an online order form but no menu. You have lost my business before it began."}
{"text":"We ordered from here through skip the dishes. The food came quick but the portions and quality were very disappointing. Not worth ordering from.. would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING. A little overpriced but who cares? Its hard to find quality desi eastablishments in Calgary. Not much can stand in the way of good butter chicken and papri chaat.

The atmosphere is so nice. As a female, I hate going to desi joints only to get gawked at by the male crowd. Makes me feel like I've been transported back to Pakistan...and not in a good way :/ Well this didn't happen here! In fact, my mom and I ended up having a long convo with the surprisingly young owner. He was incredibly friendly, professional and chilled out. 

This is a great hidden spot, perfect for youger crowds. They don't just focus on making good food, but also have a great selection of music. The customer service is fantastic and the overall ambience/vibe is excellent. It reminds me so much of those cool hangout spots in Lahore, like Zouk Cafe. I miss that, it is SO rare to find halal restaurants like that in Canada.  

I love that the employees are not all desi, and are able to speak fluent English. This is definitely a Caucasian friendly place. They also have a separate dining area for people who don't want to be surrounded by shisha smoke. I was also told that the shisha is tobacco free. I didn't try it so not sure if it still tastes good, but the smells were definitely delicious :D

They are really well known for their halwa puri on weekends. Expect long line ups. But so worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for shisha and food. They have amazing na'an and great shisha. My friends and I have gotten great customer service here; Great atmosphere & music. I would recommend this place."}
