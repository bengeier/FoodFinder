{"text":"We all have an off day or a poor eating experiences, but my trip to the Liberty Cafe was a disaster of epic proportions.  I'd like forewarn anyone heading there of the quality of their food and service.

We arrived at 11:15 for brunch and didn't leave until after 1:00, of which 90 minutes was waiting for food.  The server took our drink and food order and then forgot us until 12:15.  We then started to get a bit annoyed when the table next to us got food, while we waited another 30 minutes for our order.

Our discussions with the owner was a litany of excuses and an apology only after it was suggested.  Apparently it was our fault for coming after they had served a large group earlier in the morning - which we would have appreciated hearing about when we arrived that they had run out of eggs, etc, etc....

The meal was horrible food (Eggs Benedict with curdled hollandaise sauce,  every order wrong or missing items) and bad service (had to request butter for the cold unbuttered toast, had to go get our own cutlery).  A complete disaster.

And to make the experience complete, they were so kind (said with full sarcasm) to take off the Eggs Benedict that we had sent back off the bill.

As a former bad waiter, this is the only time I have not tipped for a meal.  The server, the kitchen and the owner all provided a truly horrible experience.  And I'll return the favour by sharing the experience as much as possible."}
{"text":"Love this place my one year old love the lentil and chicken soup. My fave. It is a gem in the middle of liberty village."}
{"text":"Working nearby means I eat here quite a bit. I like the food okay - it's a bit pricy and the management can be sticklers when it comes to taking an extra set of crackers for your soup (25 cents more please!) A good place to get a quick bite."}
{"text":"Some years back (quite a few actually), whe I was in Canada for an internship I used to temp on the side for extra cash at YTV, CMT and Treehouse office, across the street from this place. Even in the middle of winter I was always look forward to go to work and Liberty Village is the icing on the cake! 

They have some of the best stuff I have ever had in the world here, from their tuna sandwich to their creative and yummy salad. Bagel toast! Their soups are just divine (drool) oh I miss Canada!"}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of coffees and teas. 

Teas are self serve. 

There's also a nice little patio as well."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times to grab a cup of coffee on my way to the GO Train station nearby and with my husband for some breakfast.

The dark roast coffee is not bad, but I think I'd like to try some of their other brews next time.
They usually have 5 or so available.

As for food:
We have tried a toasted bagel with egg, cheese and veggies as well as a grilled cheese sandwich.
The bagel was good, but nothing I am not able to make at home.
The grilled cheese sandwich left me unimpressed.

I like the atmosphere of this cafe.
The seating options are really inviting and comfortable.
As a writer, I could totally see myself here to hack away on the laptop. ;)"}
{"text":"Best homemade soups in the city! Always tastes very fresh, my favourite place to go for lunch when the weather is cold. Their western sandwich is also great!

Coffee is not the best and their baked good leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Wow. Did not expect this place. Never judge a book by its cover. Definitely a jewel.

I've been here a couple of times in the morning before my weekly visit to the climbing gym. It is definitely a quaint little place with lots of different options. They have lots of different flavoured coffee options, which are very good. They also have a food menu with lots of delicious options. Lots of bake goods options. And more options and options. I had the tuna salad and butternut squash combination. Very well made and tasty.

Service is a little slow but sometimes good things take time to make."}
{"text":"When a friend suggested meeting here for lunch I don't really know what to expect, but when I arrived and the place was packed with people I knew it must be pretty great - and it was!  They have a wide selection of freshly made to order sandwiches, and also homemade soups.  
The set up is kind of confusing but all in all it is a great place to go for a great, quick, reasonably priced lunch."}
{"text":"Usually have 6 soups (1 or 2 veg), veg and meat chili of which most are pretty tasty and filling.  

They also have a nice selection of custom sandwiches, salads, and wraps. Pizzas, panz' and a few other premade selections for a quick lunch.

Pretty popular in the area, seating for about 25.  Some of the prices are a bit high, but the lunch combos (soup & wrap, for example) are generous and appropriately priced."}
{"text":"What a great find!!!  We were looking for a deli outside the bustle of downtown Toronto and ended up in Liberty Village. We love checking out little markets and such... 

When you walk in the door you are welcomed by ladies that will make you any made-to-order fresh ingredient sandwich on either delicious multi-grain bread or a wrap. \"You want it toasty?!\" The answer is YES!!! They will place your sandwich in a panini press and make it extra yumm-o!!

They have a large selection of home-made soups and chili...many of which are veggie happy...and it's all self serve. There were 6 to pick from the day we were there. They also have a large selection of drinks, including coffee and teas.

Make sure you look at their cold 'pre-made' foods. The 'salad rolls' are not to be missed!!! You get 3 delicious veggie and tofu rolls with a tasty dipping sauce for under $5. They also have a variety of salads and yummy looking desserts.

My husband and I shared a 'toasty' chicken breast sandwich with all the fixings on multi-grain bread and the salad rolls. What a great place for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"the wrap is always a good bang for your buck. Lots of fresh, lean chicken breast and avocado. The homemade soups are also delicious! Don't be fooled by the exterior, this place is great for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Great prices for what you get. A large soup usually lasts me 2 lunches. My recommendation is the chili or lentil soups. I've not even tried the sandwiches because the soups are so damn solid."}
{"text":"In any other area of town, this place would get three stars, but since it exists in the healthy-and-reasonably-priced-food desert that is Liberty Village, it gets four.

Liberty Village Market & Cafe makes soups and sandwiches and salads, toasts bagels, serves coffee and has a comprehensive selection of beverages. It's not rocket science, but it tastes good and it doesn't leave a major hole in your wallet. Why can't there be more cafes like this?

The lentil soup is excellent.

Only the right-side cashier takes debit."}
{"text":"The first thing you are faced with when you enter this little joint is a large table full of soups and chili. Let me tell you, it is hard to pass this area without at least getting a small cup. My all time favourite is the squash soup. Delicious every time. To your right you will find a lady that will make you a fresh sandwich or wrap. You choose all the ingredients. I recommend the avocado sandwich on fresh multi-grain bread with cheese, other veggies, topped with the cranberry mayo.  I've had it many times, and will have it again. They also have a good selection of drinks, including freshly made coffees and teas. 

I like this place for breakfast or lunch. I think you would too."}
{"text":"I've been going to Liberty Market on and off for over four years now. Their selection of breakfast and lunch choices is great. If you are a soup person, their mushroom & wild rice is a killer.

The prices aren't awesome, but I think you get what you pay for. If you are a real pasta connoisseur then you may want to steer away from their hot pasta dishes. They are okay, but over-oiled in my opinion.

I love their egg salad wraps, and their pizza is a solid 7.5/10. Drinks are pretty standard, and as Connie T. mentions in her review, the salad rolls are terrific (nut allergen alert!)."}
{"text":"I have been going to Liberty village cafe for a few years now. The place is always busy on lunch, but somehow seems in good order and it's very clean! 

They have the best butter quash potato soup! It's perfectly thick but still runny and smooth. They have potato mix with it is really smart as it helps the texture. Also coconut milk is added in the soup, really helps the flavor of sweetness from salty. Every time when I order this, I feel my taste buds experience max satisfaction. 

They also have the BEST pecan butter tarts and plain croissants! 100% freshly home made! It's made to perfection. If u love pastries, you HAVE to give it a try. I was very surprised how good they were when I didnt hold much expectation towards them while I had been going bakeries all over the places in the City. One thing is they taste like they were rite out of oven.  

Also their vege lasagna is taste of haven! I am a huge meat lover, I will never order a meal without meat! This is one meal I can say I was truly satisfied when I ordered both times. It was absolutely delicious with roasted green n red pepper, zucchini, eggplant and mushrooms....oh off course lots of cheese. Amazing! 

People work there are always nice too. One time I went to grab something, but didnt bring enough change since its rite by my office I didnt really want to bring my bag . The cashier let me take the stuff and  pay d difference later. I know its like 50 cents short, but most of places in Toronto wouldnt do that. They would rather u go back to grab yr money since you are so close by than let u take goods with you and under pay. LOL. I couldn't thank the guy enough, but he tripple ensured me its okay, no worries. hah...yeah it was nice. =)"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Fresh sandwiches, great variety and value. My fave to-go's are the fresh salad wraps that they make homemade. TO DIE FOR!!! and such a great price for the amount of food you get for it. I try and stop in here as often as I can when I'm in the area. Defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"Worth stopping in if you are in the King and Dufferin area and just want a simple soup and/or sandwich.

- Spacious and clean cafe
- Fresh well made sandwich (although nothing really special) and large good soup (lentil, in my case) deal for about $10.25 tax-in.  Nice that there were about 6 soup choices
- I didn't see any \"real\" bowls, plates, cutlery for eating in (to be fair I didn't inquire)
- I didn't come during prime-time - it could be difficult to get a seat then
- I'm at about 3.75 stars here, I will round up to 4."}
