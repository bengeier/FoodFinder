{"text":"Found this place on accident & so very glad I did. It's been my favorite place for weeks now.  Best deli in town by far. I give it 5 stars all around.  Beautful, clean, fresh amazing food what else can you ask for? Oh yea customer service, 5 stars there too. I don't need to recommend a specific dish they are all equally fantastic. I have had several things & I'm never disappointed.  They even have Starbucks. From the lady @the front counter , to the friendly guy bringing out the food, to the Starbucks barista, & back to the cooks. The owners are visible & attentive. 5 stars from me & a big thank you."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in south Scottsdale. The place is run by a great family. The food was great, especially the sides! I'd like to come back and try the salads next time."}
{"text":"I Had the Italian Melt and it was really good. Plus the place is nice to just go grab lunch and talk with some friends. Thanks guys will be back."}
{"text":"Upscale deli with something for everyone to eat. Great service with staff taking extra care that your food came out great and that you were satisfied. Will be dropping in again soon."}
{"text":"Outstanding all the way around!  Staff was friendly and helpful, service was quick and efficient, food was fresh and tasted awesome.  I had the kale salad, mac n cheese and breakfast bagel sandwich. Recommend them all. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Good selection of great food and very friendly staff!  Breakfast, salads, deli sandwiches, hot sandwiches and paninis, burgers and hots."}
{"text":"The staff was so nice & friendly, offering samples since it was my first visit. I went with the suggested chicken salad wrap & it was delicious!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Ive been there once, and I already have a love hate relationship. I love the convenience, the food, the service... I love it all. Now for that hate part: I hate that I love it all because it is so convenient for work that I will easily spend all my money on all the meals there.   In all seriousness, it was really fantastic. The pasta salad is on point, the chicken salad is bomb, and the cookies are amazing. Then to top it off, the customer service was perfection. Can't wait to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Took the family to lunch and everyone ordered a burger which was outstanding. Friendly staff even brought us some complimentary cookies towards the end of lunch, when they discovered we were first time patrons.  They were delicious. Prices are very reasonable and the sides are great too."}
{"text":"Amazing food for the convenience and price! I work in the building and eat breakfast and lunch here and dont break the bank. The owners & employees are very nice and its very clean inside. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! fresh food all the time! their paninis are my favorite and breakfast is the best wake me up! The owners are extremely nice and so welcoming. The place is always clean and sanitary.   Definitely 5stars."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice people. Look for it...definitely worth the search. The Greek salad is extraordinary."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot off the beaten path! The Italian Melt Panini was excellent and the staff was friendly and funny! :)"}
{"text":"Yes, I decided on this place from the high marks on yelp & close proximity to work. Good decision, it was my Birthday lunch with 8 coworkers. We had different salads & sandwiches all we tasty & very fresh. I enjoyed my iced tea too. Hope our management uses their catering services in the future too. Easy parking underground too. Many selections & believe they're open for breakfast too."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in to try out this place. Amazing menu, food, employees and atmosphere! We all tried something different. We had the Chicken Salad Wrap with spinach tortilla, Italian Melt, Italian Hero and Club Sandwich, we had the pasta salad and potato salad for our sides, everything we tried was FRESH and DELICIOUS! Well done, can't wait to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The best food in Scottsdale. More than just a deli, they serve EVERYTHING and it's all amazing ate here the majority of my stay in Arizona. And shoutout to the guys up front the customer service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Scotsdales finest  my granddaughter had a grill chess said said yummy yum its really good and spotless clean"}
{"text":"Hello all, I heard about this deli a few weeks ago from a coworker and I have been meaning to try it! Tuesday I happened to go in on a short break and had a wonderful experience. This place is very neat clean and well put together in all aspects. From customer service to the food etc! There was enough space to sit down and enjoy my meal as well as a patio outside. Since it was my first time in there a young man named Dillon helped me out with my order. They had a very detailed menu with many different options. Because it was a Tuesday they had a special going on with Mexican style entrees. I ordered a cilantro lime rice beef burrito. It was great! I forgot to mention that I was allergic to tomatoes so when my order came I  had to take it back. A man named Jeff was super courteous and immediately took my food back and remade it for me! Dillon then offered me a drink from the Starbucks menu they have in the deli while I waited. Finally once my food came Jeff was super apologetic about the mishap which was MY FAULT and Dillon gave me a cookie on the house. Wonderful people and the quality of their food was perfect. So glad I found a new place in the area! Highly recommend everyone tries this place!"}
{"text":"This is such a welcome restaurant in the building. The family is so warm and friendly. The food is delicious. I always get lemon rice soup which is a favorite and Greek salad with chicken. The salad is very fresh."}
{"text":"Across the back courtyard from the Marriot, this is a great little spot. I got the breakfast burrito. All ingredients were cooked to order, not scooped out of a precooked container, and It was excellent. Fast, friendly and priced right. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  I am in town for the week and my company HQ is in the building - so of course I checked it out...  Cut to four days later and this is the only place in Scottsdale I've had breakfast or lunch!  This little deli serves up hot, fresh, tasty early and mid-day meals at ridiculously reasonable prices.  They have a really wide selection of both breakfast and lunch options, a special of the day that usually puts your traditional ham sammy to shame, and unique daily soup options top it all off.  (Hint: Try the lobster bisque).  I only have 2 more days in town, but that works out to 4 more meals, so YAY!  Service is great, they're quick, and you'll leave *full*."}
{"text":"Nice place for quality breakfast or lunch, if you can find it.  It is located on 1st floor of office building with no outside signage, that caters to office tenants."}
{"text":"Kudos to Original marketplace for backing up my free lunch (about a week or so after the occurance) even though it took me awhile to go back in and they were more than honored to still honor this offer.   I continue to visit from time to time and continued great service and no issues with anything ordered.   Finally have a nice place to eat at by work :)"}
{"text":"This little cafe/restaurant is nestled within an office building in the courtyard where the Marriot and another office building meets. I first came here because I saw the \"Starbucks\" sign out front (yay Starbucks!).  This place is family owned and truly full service. They have a huge selection of drinks (coffee, sodas, even protein shakes), as well as food and their specials of the day are always amazing. I've seen their catering before and it is quite impressive. There is outdoor seating as well as indoor seating although a lot of people will get their food to go. It gets packed during lunch time!  My favorite's are the sunrise bagel and the veggie wrap!"}
{"text":"Once food was delivered it was delicious but they definitely had some kinks. Also the candy treat my daughter got (licorice) was very hard we had to throw it out"}
{"text":"Most AMAZING veggie sandwich we have EVER had! The greek pasta salad was unbelievably tasty. The service is super friendly and they checked on us a few times to make sure we were ok. I highly recommend coming and giving this hidden gem a try."}
{"text":"This place is awesome , very cozy atmosphere, great food , and great customer service! Definitely recommend this hidden gem if your ever nearby."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Husband had a breakfast burrito. So fresh and good. Son had a burger for breakfast. Also fresh. I had a fruit smoothie. Yum! Great small place with excellent friendly service."}
{"text":"Had to follow suit and give this place a try. Its a wonderful little market with great food, great prices, and great service. One of the counter ladies gave me a cookie because she realized it was my first time in. Can't beat that! Makes me jealous because this is way better than the market at my office building."}
{"text":"A solid sandwich soup and sandwich shop for a great price. We had a lot of trouble finding the place since it's located inside the office building itself. But worth the find.   I wasn't impressed with the Reuben sandwich, but I'm also weird in that I like mine with lots of tangy sauerkraut. But everyone else liked their food."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but the caring and service even better!   Right at the end of Brown St at East Indian School Rd."}
{"text":"I rarely see a 5 star avg rating so when I was in town for work I had to give this a try. I almost passed it up because it sits in between two office buildings so I didn't find it right away but I'm glad I found it. They made me a burger that I saw on yelp but was not a regular menu item and it was awesome. Then the owner brought me a cup of soup on the house to try and I've never had soup like it. It was a chicken lemon rice of her making and is very good. Then finally there's the fresh daily cookie. Anytime I'm back in Scottsdale I will be back. I want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Wanted a quick bite before I headed back to my Airbnb to pack and left for the airport... great choice! They were really busy (Monday lunch rush!) and misplaced my order. They apologized a million times and after I politely declined a drink (I had one at home), they insisted on giving me a small side of pasta. The sandwich (city club) was delicious, the pasta was delicious, and the customer service is spot on. Great meal to end my trip in AZ!"}
{"text":"This place is located inside a office building but it doesn't mean you have to be apart of this office building to come enjoy this beautiful place. This place has a nice dining room with a convertible relaxing area with magazines and Tvs. It has a seating area outside as well. Wide variety of snacks, sandwiches and salads. Also has coffee with Starbucks menu. The sandwich i got was the walnut chicken and wow can I say I didn't expect that much flavor to come out of a walnut chicken sandwich, it was very rich in flavor and the texture was great. The sandwich was amazing and I got a side of the pasta salad which was great mixed with feta cheese. A very clean place with great customer service as well. If you're in the area and want something fresh and healthy I recommend coming here and showing this place some love."}
{"text":"We were staying next door at the Marriott Suites, took the Yelp five star advice and enjoyed a great lunch. The staff were extremely helpful and nice.   It's kind of hard to find. The hotel staff didn't even know about this gem, even though it's only about 75' from the hotel's outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. This is a cafe style interior office space converted to a awesome restaurant. Good food. Friendly service. Highly recommended. I'm not local to Phoenix and simply found it using Yelp. Hidden gem in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast or lunch. I have never been disappointed but always pleasantly surprised. Were I come from a lot of small places like this are family owned and you're always treated like family.  It's nice to find a place with the same atmosphere. Thanks. See you soon."}
{"text":"This is a super nice place.  Just a block off of Old Scottsdale.  Super nice guy took our order and not knowing what to order he gave my wife a sample of the walnut chicken salad and she was sold.  I had the french dip and my son had the chicken chipotle which were both incredibly delicious.  All for an afordable $27 including drinks and sides. Probably getting a giant cookie to go that just came out of the oven. This place was a well deserved 5 stars."}
{"text":"Felt a little hungry in my hotel and decided to see what was around and boy let me tell you I am glad I did . This little place was amazing ! The decor and cleanliness was excellent ! The service was absolutely superb. I was greeted upon walking in even though they were slammed busy. I got my food in less that 10 minutes and it was exactly as I wanted . I had the French dip and for a drink I had a Starbucks Carmel Frap because believe it or not they have full service Starbucks products as well ! Definitely going to come back here anytime I'm around the area !"}
{"text":"The restaurant is an office campus but it is a true diamond in the rough.  The beautiful decor is matched by excellent food and even better service.  The owners are on-site and are there to make your dining experience as memorable and enjoyable as possible.  I would definitely come back and try the omelette with veggies."}
{"text":"Service was very good and gives you that welcome home feeling.  The food was delicious and the recommendation made it extra special.  Highly recommend the Italian Melt and the Chicken Lemon Rice.  The Santa Fe Club was also very good.  I can't wait to fit this place into my day for another stop.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough nice things about this place. Good quality food, great service & the nicest staff you ever met! I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Inside an office building. A little difficult to find and not much parking. Food is very good for the price."}
{"text":"First time going here today, and if i could give it a 100/5 stars i would!! Food was great, prices were reasonable, the staff there make you feel like you're at home, remembering your name and all. Its a bit of a hidden location, but it's worth the search. Definitely gonna come back!!"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem. A small little order-up counter, a grill and a few tables. It's a little hard to find this place. There aren't any signs out on the road.  The cafe is located in the inner courtyard of the building . So if you wander into the office building like I did walk straight through on the first floor and go into the courtyard, you'll see the red awning. Great selection of breakfast items including breakfast burritos and sandwiches.  I had the BEAST (Bacon, Egg, Avocado, Swiss, Tomato). On sourdough toast with a side of hash browns. They serve Starbucks coffee.  All together, $8.39,  you can't beat it for a great breakfast.  Glad I wandered around long enough to find this place. I recommend you do the same. You won't be disappointed.   They also have many other lunch selections, like paninis, salads and burgers."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! I couldn't wait for this spot to open in the office building I work at. Very spacious and comfortable. It's def by far the nicest deli I have been to around town. Friendly staff, great customer service, fair prices and the food is delicious. Very impressed with the wide variety menu compared to the usual deli in an office building.   I ordered a Chicken Chipotle sandwich and a side of the baked Mac n Cheese.... A+  On my way out I noticed a Starbucks sign...YES GUYS! I said Starbucks....The Original Marketplace are authorized to serve Starbucks. :)))) Now I know where I can go to get my coffee fix every morning!   Thanks guys and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing second time going, its right in the the Arcadis office building  which is super close to work. Their food is amazing and the staff is so friendly. They are also really quick I have time on a 30 min lunch to walk over and still have time to eat.The B.L.A.S.T sandwich is amazing definitely a place worth trying!!"}
{"text":"Original is right on! Love the upscale decor and cleanliness. This coffee shop deli is definitely my go to place for morning coffee meetings, lunch meetings or just to veg. Plenty of fresh items on the menu to keep you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Awesome prices and great food. Cashier was a little inattentive but the owners are awesome. Convenient to Marriott and much better prices. Ate breakfast."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable and the food is great. Haven't found anything I didn't like yet..  Can be hard to find if you don't know your way around the area but it is located on the first level within an office building. There are no street signs to see the restaurant and no where to direct you where to park but there is public parking on the street and underneath the office building."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe how good the burger from here was. I got the bacon and cheddar burger and it tasted like it came from an upscale \"fine\" burger restaurant. The prices are great and it's easy to get in and get out around lunch time."}
{"text":"This place is nestled on the first floor of the building where I work and what a great addition to the building!  They are extremely helpful and service is beyond all expected.  They have catered a few events for our company and have done a bang-up job!  Dylan is as sweet as they come and Hoda is the best!  They will make just about anything you want and so far I have not found anything that I have disliked.  If you are in the area of Indian School and Buckboard I recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"We needed a quick bite for lunch before heading to a work meeting after flying into Phoenix.  I'd have to say, if you don't know exactly where this place is, its hard to find...buried in an office building (or something, I don't even know we were in a hurry!) with either little or no signage outside that we noticed.  But once we finally tracked it down on the first floor of the building, we were pleasantly surprised.  It was busy with what seemed to be a lot of local people on their lunch break.  My husband had a burger and I got a sandwich and both tasted fresh and were delicious (also, very nicely presented).  I also really appreciate the fact that they had GOOD gluten free bread!  The two workers we interacted with were super friendly and welcoming which also makes for an even better experience."}
{"text":"Dillan is super friendly nice food very reasonably priced with a nice indoor and outdoor sitting area."}
{"text":"Another great find on Yelp. Great little breakfast & lunch small cafe type delight. Hidden within an inside courtyard behind Marriott. Had a Ruben & Tuna sandwich, both delicious with several side options. No online menu, being revised, but called owner & he emailed it to me. Will definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and had a wonderful experience hosted by a wonderful staff. This family owned and operated restaurant took incredible care of us!"}
{"text":"The owner is super helpful, sweet & very nice! Food is tasty & not the mention the menu has so many opinions to chose from."}
{"text":"Five stars not only for the food, but for the service. The sandwiches were great, but the fact we got a free cookie with strawberries for our first time there, put it over-the-top. Great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp.  A little hidden, but worth the find.  Casual setting inside or out.  Not a coffee drinker, but traffic was steady with coffee orders.  We had a lite breakfast with a build your own omelette and a bagel sandwich with a side of hash browns.   Added turkey to the omelette.  Most places don't have that option or don't suggest it.  Jeff took good care of us and service was fast.  Food was good.  Made sure to check in with us often. They also have a lot of different snacks and ready to go salads, fruit cups, pastries, chips bottled drinks etc.  we will stop here more often! Also, for those of you that love fountain drinks they offer them!   Diet Coke was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere!  My company recently moved our layover hotel right across the courtyard from this restaurant. What a score!  I tried the City Cobb Salad with chicken and bacon and it was outstanding.  Very fresh veggies and their chicken was grilled to perfection.  Next time I'm going to try one of the burgers.  Overall, the Original Marketplace is a great find.  Highly recommended for anyone and especially my fellow crew members!"}
{"text":"Visiting in Scottsdale and looked for a place to get a quick sandwich. Boy did we get lucky! I had a gyro and my husband had a cheese steak sandwich . Both were excellent. Service was very quick even though they were very busy. And the owner even stopped by our table to make sure we were happy with everything we ordered. We definitely were. Highly recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegan....EXCEPT when I'm here at T.O.M. Amazing service with amazing food. Unexpected location and unexpected detail to food. Go inside and taste first. If your eyes are closed, you will think you're in heaven and not at the lunch break Kitchen of an office building. I hope they decide to go big and launch everywhere."}
{"text":"Well, Ive read so many wonderful reviews and was looking forward to having breakfast with you. However, it would help if your business was actually open during YOUR posted hours."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Staff is extremely helpful and courteous! Great portions on the food as well! Definitely would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I was temping in an office a few miles away for the day and went to yelp to find someplace to eat. It was close so I went.  I was completely confused when the address was a large office building but there a parking spot right in front and I had lots of time so i figured what the heck.  I was concerned when I went in and it appeared to be an office sandwich shop.  But the menu was huge.  Salads, paninis, burgers, sandwiches and all very interesting, not just ham and cheese.  Even a Cuban!  I tried the Italian panini on a sub roll.  It was delicious and huge. The quality of the ingredients was really high. The roll was super fresh.  A large selection of sides, I chose cottage cheese. $10 for a big, fresh sandwich, side and drink is hard to find.  It may be in a weird location if you don't work in that building but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go for a quick breakfast/lunch or a snack. It's kind of hidden in an office building and has that office cafeteria feel. The food was decent (I ordered the bacon burger), but the service is the best aspect of this resturant. I would rate the food 3 stars but the service bumps it up to a 4. The food came quickly and the staff was very friendly and easy to talk to. Try it if you're looking for something quick and comfortable."}
{"text":"My hubby loved his French dip. I got a bbq cheddar burger with gluten free bread. It was good although I would've preferred more bbq sauce on it. My sons got a plain burger and a plain cheeseburger. They didn't have GF buns and they didn't want the GF bread. So I ordered no bread but it came with the bun anyway. Thankfully my son doesn't get sick if gluten touches his food so I didn't get upset and send it back. But they were a little upset because then most of the ketchup was stuck on the bun rather than their burger. Oh well. The lady serving is was super nice. I'm glad I read the reviews or we never would've found this place. It was quite odd being inside an office building. There was a nice courtyard outside to eat at though."}
{"text":"Do a yelp check in to get a free side.  Great location if you work in the nearby offices   or business hotels. In and outdoor seating. Friendly staff and healthy food options. Busy establishment. Service super friendly.  Had the gyro sandwich, the meat flavor was there but really missed the taziki sauce that would've completed it for me. The turkey reuben was tasty but pal expected a little higher pile of meat. He's not a big eater but complained he was still hungry, for the price and amount.   We went out of our way to try this place."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place to have lunch!! My husband and I drove 40 miles to get to this place. I had the walnut chicken salad and my husband had a boars head turkey sandwich and they were both fantastic. Come and try it here you won't regret it. I forgot to mention that the owner gave us a cookie, after my husband had it he went and got 2 more. Tell them Marilyn sent you"}
{"text":"I just had one of the best chili cheese onion omelets I've ever had in a long, long time! Excellent food, great coffee and danishes too! Prices can't be beat for the flavor and portions! 5 stars and 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Very clean, very good food, good serving size, reasonable pricing, great service and very friendly staff. I would definitely recommend coming to this establishment. I would give this 10 stars if it was available."}
{"text":"New business nestled in the office building, with an entrance in the courtyard behind the Marriott suites! No outside signage yet, but it's in the same location as was Pacific's. Same location, but completely remodeled! From furnishings to menu.    Just opened, I believe today, and business is booming already.. Had the bacon and blue burger. Nice size burger. Cooked perfectly. Crispy bacon. All in all, very good!   I know my colleagues and I will make this a regular breakfast and lunch stop!"}
{"text":"I just took my 92 yr old father to lunch. We both had salads and they were great. The owner took my order and modified the salad for my Dad. It was a. We had a very enjoyable lunch and will definitely be back. Thank you..."}
{"text":"What a fabulous lunch place with great people.  I had a carne asada salad with lemon chicken rice soup and it was simply awesome.  The soup was made from scratch and the salad was fresh.  Nice to be greeted by employees who appreciate you.  They cater and have a great menu. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Food is excellent the people that run it are even better.  The walnut chicken salad (made with real chicken) bursts with flavor.  The Italian panini was over the top with flavor. For a side try the mac salad - you won't disappoint.  Hope you enjoy as much as we did!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to try it out because of the high reviews. The food was pretty good, and the staff was amazingly friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"WOW! What an absolute gem! Jumped on Yelp to choose a place for a quick lunch and the first search result (The Original Marketplace) was a place I had never heard of but had stellar reviews and was close to our house. We hopped in the car and headed over to the office building in Old Town and found parking without any problems. We went right at the lunch rush and there were plenty of folks inside but we were still able to find a table right away. They have a huge and very varied menu and I was having trouble deciding but I finally went with the steak sandwich and my S/O went with the reuben. Both sandwiches were phenomenal and the mac and cheese was to die for.  Although the food was amazing, it paled in comparison to the STELLAR service we received. It's a family run business and the pride of ownership shines through in everything that they do. Jeff and Huda (spelling??) were warm, welcoming, friendly, and made us feel like family. This isn't the false warmth you sometimes receive in order to boost a gratuity but a genuine happiness that you have come to visit them and eat their food.   We will absolutely, undoubtedly be back and are looking forward to trying more of their offerings. Keep up the fantastic work!"}
{"text":"This place is worth the find!   Wasn't sure how to get here, but we parked in the visitor spots in the garage and went to the first floor and followed the sign!   So glad we did!   The only thing better than the delicious food and coffee was the super friendly  and helpful staff!!     Will definitely be back!!!   The breakfast sandwich is terrific!!"}
{"text":"Best.Burger.Ever! Period!   If you want to have an award winning burger experience, try the chipotle avocado burger! Seriously, one of the best burgers I've ever eaten.  The top of it, the owner is one of the friendliest business owner I've ever met, taking care of customers in a way that is way over any reasonable expectation. Highly recommended place for even the pickiest guests."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a great deli in Scottsdale AZ that focused on flavor first, but can still deliver a sizable meal.  Case in point, the Italian Melt.  Idk who thought of creating this bad boy but it's pretty damn good.     I'd recommend if you're looking to for your To-Go/Delivery order to look and taste like it was made fresh then The Original Marketplace will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Food and Service was outstanding. Presentation of their food is exactly how it tastes! Stunning. Great Panini Sandwiches and Salads! A must try!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive and very good! The staff was very friendly and attentive! Atmosphere was nice and very clean."}
{"text":"Omg this panini is amazing. So fresh love this place it never fails they always have the best food"}
{"text":"The breakfast was really good! We found after checking yelp and expected it to be difficult to find. Inside courtyard of an office building. Worth looking for. Omelette and French toast were great! Fresh fruit was very fresh! Great, friendly staff and owner. We'll be back"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch spot with endless options! The daily special is ever-changing and when I try something new, I can ALWAYS count on what I order is delicious and well planned. There are options for salad lovers, burgers, sandwiches, wraps, pasta, breakfast variety, fruit and snacks, shakes, and STARBUCKS! Anyone can enjoy this quaint spot that has seating indoor and outdoors. You guys have great taste!"}
{"text":"Very hard to find and when we finally found it, they were closed! No signs saying anything, just closed even though the yelp page says 6 am til 4 pm. This is the 2nd time this has happened to me....and the last."}
