{"text":"Yum food we tried birds nest & clay pot chicken with mushrooms that's number 51 on menu"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very no frills, it's your typical low key mom & pop shop. Being Vietnamese and having traveled back to Viet Nam numerous times, I can honestly say that the food here couldn't get any more authentic! The spring rolls are AMAZING!!! Grilled chicken with rice is awesomely good and the pho (beef noodle soup) definitely hit the spot! Service is friendly yet simple, when you're paying $7-8 for an entrée....you can't expect much. The owner is cute and such a friendly lady."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a horrible experience eating here with his cousins who had recommended it to be good Vietnamese food in the Montreal and surrounding area. We arrived at the restaurant, it t was busy, we did not mind waiting as we did not make reservations.  Three members of the staff came up to ask us how many people in our party in a span of 40 minutes. Clearly there was lack of communication among the staff for this to happen and none of them seem to help make seating us any faster. We finally got a table after 40 minutes waiting, we sat down and ordered immediately as we had time to see the menu while waiting for a table. My bowl of Pho arrived at the table first although it took 15 minutes to get there. The Pho tasted too sweet and it was all noodles and no meat, I was not very satisfied. Then the next two meals took another 30 minutes to arrive. They did not arrive until I was basically finished my meal. Then there was my husband's meal it never came we asked two different waiters twice about it. They had completely forgot to make it. It arrived probably another 40 minutes after the 2nd and 3rd meal came out. There was no apology from the waiter, manager or any staff member about his meal. At this point my husband was starving and I felt awkward sitting there waiting for everyone else to get their meal and finishing eating. We did not even eat together as we had intended. So my husband's bun bo hue finally arrived at the table, it tasted absolutely horrible, it was not even remotely authentic tasting. I think if you took one of those Bun Bo Hue seasoning cubes that you get at the Asian grocery store and stir it in hot water it would taste more authentic. It was an awful experience the food did not taste at all good and was extremely expensive for Vietnamese food, service was horrible and well the piles of dirty glasses and half consumed drinks piling on the bar was not impressive either. My husband and I would never go there again. Vietnamese food in Toronto tastes extremely better and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"We would recommend this Vietnamese restaurant if you want a quick fix of Pho' soup. The place was decent and the price was right. The food was very tasty and satisfying."}
{"text":"Banh Xeo. Which was basically a crepe filled with a stir-fry mixture of bean sprouts, pork and shrimp fragrant in spices. A pretty unique dish, as with the Bo Ba Muon, this one requires eating with your hands as well, not to say that one normally eats with their feet, but you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese food in the city!  I go all the time, and it is a good thing I don't live closer or I would be there every day!  The barbeque pork is the best.  #22 comes with the pork, some shrimp chips and these beautiful wide rice noodles that are soft and delicious! I like taking a little of everything and putting it on a shrimp chip and dunking it in the fish sauce.    The beef in vine leaves is amazing.  You wrap up some meat and veggies with the rice vermicelli in a rice paper and roll them up yourself.  The peanut sauce is not typical peanut butter sauce (and that is a good thing!)  It has chunks of peanuts and is a little bit spicy.  Wonderful!  The wonton soup is amazing, with fluffy wontons and garlic chives in their amazing broth.    The combos come with a great little soup, a crunchy imperial roll and the best grilled chicken I have ever eaten.  The beef is amazing too, but I have a soft spot for the chicken.  Whenever I feel under the weather, their pho makes me feel better.  They'll pack anything to go, and the soup comes in a separate container from the noodles and beef (with the veggies in a bag) so you can leave it till later for dinner and it is almost as good as eating it right away.    I also have to get an iced coffee every time I go.  They use real Vietnamese coffee and you have to wait till it is done brewing at your table, then stir the coffee to mix in the condensed milk at the bottom of the cup and then pour it over the glass of ice that comes with it.  Amazing! Hard to drink just one.  Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while. I was glad to find out about it recently as its walking distance from our place. It's just a run of the mill mom n pop shop but quick n simple Vietnamese cuisine.  Great for when you crave Pho at all times of the day (except Tuesday's). Will return often! They have takeout and delivery too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely Avoid the Chinese or Thai dishes.  If you stick to the traditional Vietnamese food, you can't go wrong. There are some dishes that are hard to find in other Viet restaurants.  Prices are a lot higher than they should be though for this type of food."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon H&H when I first moved to Etobicoke. I was coming off a wild night, and my typical \"go-to\" hangover cure (GATORADE) just wasn't doing the trick. Since I had NO desire to cook, I thought i would try my other remedy, PHO!  I was pleasantly surprised by this place; Food is very good, and the service is quick/courteous! I'll admit, like others have said, it's not the best PHO, but, it does the trick! Someone touched on the decor in another review; it's not great, but, c'mon, you don't go to these places for the interior design, you go for quick/tasty food! I'm giving it a 4 - The PHO may not be as good as the spots on Ossington, but, for the area, i would say it hits the mark! Check it out if you're in the Royal York/Queensway area, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good Vietnamese food. Nice terrace for the summer."}
{"text":"The food is quite mediocre compared to other pho places in south Etobicoke. It is also a bit overpriced. Maybe we came at a wrong time of the day but pho broth lacked flavor and tasted a bit diluted. The rare beef had a little less beef than other places serve (and beef wasn't so rare as served by their competitors).  We ordered two pho soups (medium size) and asked to put beef tripe into one of them which as we later discovered cost us extra $2. Paying over $20 for two pho's is a bit pricy, since we usually manage to stay within $16."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the second time.  Had a pho the first time which was very good but nothing extraordinary.  This time I had the ginger chicken.  It was, by far, the best one I've ever had in a Vietnamese restaurant. My partner, at the waiter's suggestion, had the Banh Xeo (large paper-thin crepe filled with pork, shrimp and other goodies) and loved it . The prices are fair and the quantities of food served good.  Our waiter was fast, efficient, friendly and gave us lots of information on the dishes we selected and a few others on the menu.  The decor is plain and parking on Victoria can be a challenge during the busy periods."}
{"text":"By far the best Vietnamese restaurant in the South Shore (actually, it's better than any other Asian-style restaurant in the South Shore)! They have a great variety of foods, and they even deliver. The service is fast and polite, and the food is made with great quality ingredients. I've tried 6 different dishes here and they were all awesome, plus the portions are big so you might even have leftovers for lunch the next day.  This place is definitely my favorite restaurant in the South Shore."}
{"text":"Fresh rolls are good. I've had better pho elsewhere, however prices are cheap."}
{"text":"J'habite près du restaurant. Un des meilleurs que je connaisse, met varié, bonne cuisine, toute personne qui venait avec moi prenait une carte pour y retourner."}
{"text":"Excellent pho and amazing bun (vermicelli with pork and vegetables).  Mon Mari et moi avons ADORE ce restaurant. Le diner a ete servi rapidement, les plats etaient succulents et Le service attentif. On y reviendra!"}

{"text":"I went to this restaurant a couple nights ago with a very large group. I ordered something that turned out to be too sweet for me, and though I felt a little weird about it because it wasn't over/undercooked, I asked if I could exchange it for something else. Rather than dumping a pile of bean sprouts over my head, they took the dish back and gave me something new - it was excellent. The BBQ meat had a great flavour and everything was fresh. The service was also super fast despite the size of our group. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Etobicoke. This is a great place to go to get your Pho fix. Great on a cold winter day or for lunch when you're hungover. Although the decor isn't the best, they churn out good, consistent and authentic Vietnamese cuisine. I've had Pho here at least a dozen times and will continue to come back. I highly recommended it!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal there tonight. We're the only people when we arrived so please don't let that discourage you from staying.   We had deep fried rolls, rare beef pho and grilled pork bun. All delicious! The rolls were the best rolls we've had in a very long time compared to other pho places. The grilled pork had an excellent flavour and grilled on a BBQ with no fatty pieces. The pho had a great flavour, the only thing negative is that it could have had a couple more pieces of meat.   Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"WTF, ARE YOU SERIOUS??? This place is total crap~! I ate here a couple of weeks ago with some friends who live nearby. It was a freezing, lazy kind of day so I thought we ought to have something soupy with other options as there were a few of us. While you can't please everyone, at least try, right?? Another friend recommended this place, saying she'd eaten at their other location and told me what to get but the item was not to be found on the menu at this location, but there was a sign in their window touting \"authentic\" cuisine so we all just ordered whatever seemed appetizing at the time.  We arrived at about 5pm to an empty restaurant decorated like a Zen spa with white-linen tables complete with wine glasses (BYOW if you wish): Buddha statues, incense burning, possibly even a small fountain somewhere, I don't recall. The sign in their window said they were closed but that wasn't the case. It was a blistery-cold day so we figured we'd be the only ones dining but then slowly a party of eight Asians came parading through with balloons and a cake. I figured how bad could it be, right? I WAS WRONG! I should have known when I saw bowls of pho for $10 and vermicelli for $12!  As much as I wanted soup, there was no way I was going to pay for pho at $10, so I went for some dish that I thought was going to be chicken with bamboo on rice in hot pot ($14). I know, it sounded like something I could get in Chinatown but nothing else really appealed to me that didn't sound like a complete rip-off! My friends ordered pad thai (don't ask; $13), another got the four-course meal with four skewers of different meats (one chicken, one beef, shrimp, and prob pork) for $25, and I can't remember what the other got but just as well as I didn't try theirs.   My dish was AWFUL. There was ZERO flavour in it and no sauce in the toppings whatsoever so it was this dry pile of a few shreds of tasteless chicken (old, brown meat) and bamboo on top of rice that crusts from the hot pot. There was no appropriate sauce to go with this thing so I just ate what I could. My friend loved her pad thai which came with a fried spring roll and fish sauce, but she's also never had Viet food (not that pad thai is a Viet dish) so I guess the exotic factor had her swooning. I tried some and the noodles were overcooked and the only flavour I could detect was soy sauce! I didn't say anything to set her straight because really, if she's happy with it, who was I to tell her otherwise? Even still, what was up with the odd combination of the soy sauce pad thai with the spring roll/fish sauce?? Our other friend's meal came with a choice of spring roll or bowl of soup, which was actually a mini bowl of pho, the four-skewers on rice plate, and some warm jelly dessert with coconut milk that I can't recall much more of, and the tea/coffee option which never arrived. The other guy had something or other that was straight out of a Chinese menu. Even the sauces on their table were the kind you'd find in a Chinese resto: hot sauce (not sriracha) and soy sauce.   Honestly, the meal was a total rip-off, coming out to ~$85 with tax, which is totally unheard of for four people in a Viet resto who aren't ordering things like seafood, or a whole roasted animal. Plus there was nothing \"authentic\" about this place. I don't know if this restaurant means to cater to non-Asians or Viet-food-virgins with its décor and white tablecloths and their sign about \"authenticity\" but even still, I thought since it's located in Brossard where there are tons of ethnics, that it would be more ...real?   I have noticed a difference in Viet food in MTL vs Toronto and I have to say that I like TO's better but that's not reason to go stinking so badly! Thankfully we brought our own wine and didn't waste anymore money at this place, cos it was just AWFUL. The only plus was the service--our server wasn't overly friendly but still nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant vraiment authentique vietnamien. Meilleure soupe repas mangé de ma vie. Un petit bijoux!"}
{"text":"Definitely authentic Vietnamese food. Chicken wings are to die for. Bo Kho is the best in the city. Polite & friendly service. I have eaten here many times and many more to come."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Vietnamese food that is super reasonably priced!!  Imperial rolls and lemongrass beef vermicelli are to die for and so is the Mi Hoai Houng- best Vietnamese soup I've ever had!!!  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I was craving Vietnamese food and found this in the area. We ordered the shrimp spring rolls , so yummy and crispy with a nice dipping sauce. Then I got the seafood pho , great broth nice and light, the seafood was perfectly cooked , noodles were good too. And my boyfriend got the crispy seafood noodles , amazinggg they had a light sauce and a nice crunch! I also had an avocado smoothie , it was not too sweet and very creamy. Definitely making this my new spot!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been looking for Vietnamese restaurants in the area, although not disappointing it is mediocre for the amount of meat to noodles you get. The food is authentic Vietnamese noodles.  I'd return because it is very close to home and the price is decent, but Mekong River offers a better bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"Proche du métro Côté sainte Catherine, service assez rapide, place assez grande pour recevoir des groupes, prix abordable...  Malgré tout, j'ai connu d'autres endroits où la nourriture avait plus de saveurs et où la déco était plus développée. Je dis cela par comparaison."}
{"text":"This was our last spot before heading back to the airport. Really cute neighborhood spot with outdoor seating. When we arrived, there were a few tables left and we quickly snatched one in the sun. The menu is pretty extensive and we ordered the bird's nest with seafood as well as pork vermicelli with salad and a beef roll. They also had pretty good house white wine by the glass, carafe or bottle. The wine came out quickly and although the food did not come out together, there was only a 5 min delay or so. The food was fresh and delicious. Portions were very generous and though I'm not normally a sauce lover, the sauce that came with the bird's nest meal was spot on. Friendly service, delicious food, and good wine - can't ask for much more than that."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and good location. Food is always delicious. I always look forward to trying new things every time I go.  I really enjoy their delicious soups and fresh spring rolls. Great place for lunch or dinner :)"}

{"text":"Mes parents, des vietnamiens très difficiles (car ma mère cuisine très bien une variété étonnante de plats vietnamiens), aiment bien ce restaurant.   DÉCOR: Pas très beau, quand même serré comme espace, toilette vraiment pas séduisante (pour rester poli). Mais les restaurants asiatiques typiques vietnamiens de la première génération sont rarement beaux et aussi propres que l'on voudrait.   MENU: Il faut faire attention, car ce restaurant a un menu adapté typiquement pour le Québec et un menu traditionnel vietnamien. Il faut également noter que je ne mange que très peu de rouleaux impériaux, car j'en ai trop mangé quand j'étais jeune et que j'aime mieux ce qui n'est pas frit. Voici donc les plats qui sont typiques vietnamiens que nous avons essayés et qui vaut la peine d'essayer:  BÒ BA MÓN, BÁNH TRÁNG, MM NÊM | Trois variétés rouleaux de boeuf servi avec vermicelle, papier de riz et laitue fraîche  BÁNH ?ÂP Galette de riz servi avec porc grillé sur croustille de crevette, accompagnée de laitue fraîche du jour  BÁNH XÈO Crêpe vietnamienne au poulet et crevette, avec laitue de saison  CM SN, BÌ, CH Côtelettes de porc, porc émincé et pâté vietnamien, servi avec riz et salade  MÌ HOÀI HNG KHO Soupe Hoai-Huong, porc accompagné crevette panée (kho=bouillon apart avec sauce aigre douce)  PRIX : Très abordable."}
{"text":"Okay bun, but the sauce was very sweet. The imperial roll was like an egg roll. Although the service was nice and they let us substitute chicken for pork on one of the dishes."}
{"text":"Just moved into the Swansea neighbourhood and had a hankering for Pho. Instead of going to the Junction for takeout, decided to check out what Yelp recommended in our neighbourhood. My husband is from Laos so it had to be good, and we decided to take a chance. Ordered takeout and drove to the location. This place is a no frills no frills hole in the wall. We ordered shrimp fresh rolls, Pho dac biet, and pork and chicken on broken rice. Everything was DELICIOUS, perfectly spiced, mouth watering!! Amazing underrated food. Pleasantly surprised, friendly cashier, the fish in the fish tank looked well fed ;)."}
{"text":"For starters, I can't even pronounce the name of this place. You walk in, the ambience is pleasant, but as you check the menu you notice that it's considerably pricier than Sen Vang down the street. And I can pronounce Sen Vang. The selection, it must be said is definitely more extensive than the aforementioned competitor, so that's a positive. Their service is alright, not really noteworthy.  Once your food arrives and you dig in... It's good. But I don't think good cuts it at their price point. Down the street, there's a similar Vietnamese place that's excellent, and it's cheaper, so what's the deal?  Why do I eat here, you ask? Sen Vang is closed on Wednesday's, these guys are only other game in the neighbourhood when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine.  Should you eat here? Frankly, only if one of three conditions are met:  1. It's a Wednesday  2. You only have interac (Sen Vang is cash only) 3. It really has to be Vietnamese food"}

{"text":"Spring has finally begun to appear and of course this means folks are out and about catching sun rays, whether at the park, along the water, and of course, on patios and terraces. So we figured it was as good a time as any to try out the patio at Hoai Hoang, just a couple blocks from our place. It was one of the few Vietnamese spots that we had yet to eat at, and it seems like a popular spot every time we walk by.   We lucked out and found a patio table, and both ordered the BBQ pork chop and shrimp with rice and salad. Safe choice. That said, the dish for me ended up not being that memorable. Though the sauce was tasty, the pork chop was a little overlooked and dry, and the shrimp was just okay. The salad seemed like it had been sitting around on the plate for awhile.   Maybe this wasn't a specialty dish, but next time I'll stick with the pho. Hard to go wrong with that.   The patio did make the experience much nicer, and the service was solid."}
{"text":"I was a little thrown off.  I usually expect to see Sriracha and hoisin sauce prepared on the tables when I go out for pho.  I had a hard time with the waitress trying to get the correct sauces brought to our table because she didn't really speak english.  I asked for a vegetarian dish - vegetarian spring rolls on vermicelli, but the dish was served with chopped bacon on top!  My friend ordered a pork chop with rick.  Pork chop was tasty, rice was dry"}
{"text":"Growing up I've had my fair share of Vietnamese cuisine. One thing for sure is that the food here is authentic and tastes good but there are definitely some things that can be improved on.   The price isn't high, but is $1-2 higher than the typical Vietnamese restaurant and you don't get as much food as other places. Considering vermicelli noodles and rice aren't expensive, it wouldn't hurt to put more.   I got the chicken and spring roll vermicelli. The taste was good but nothing spectacular and as you can see, a little burnt.   My dad got the chicken and pork chop rice dish and though I didn't get a picture, it was quite burnt (we got takeout and obviously didn't see until we got back)    I don't think I'd come back but I wouldn't discourage people from going if they're in the area and are in need of a Vietnamese dish."}
{"text":"A clean, friendly Vietnamese neighborhood restaurant.  I went for my typical V-meal and got spring rolls and Pho Bac.  Both were excellent.  You're not going to win over a date with this place - unless you have been together for a while and are pretty comfortable with each other and like casual.  But you will have a good, inexpensive meal.  All of the diners appeared to be locals, happily munching away on real Vietnamese cooking."}
{"text":"Solid, cheap Vietnamese food. Don't expect to have your mind blown, but do expect to be well fed and satisfied, for cheap. My vegan relatives really dig the vermicelli with spring rolls. The pho is decent. The beef balls are meh, but the meat has always seemed fresh enough. Noodles are good. Spring rolls quite excellent. The decor is stark but tolerable. Ideal for take-out."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that they are never open when I want to come they are a great restaurant.  Byow and the portions and prices are great.  We reserved a table for 5:20 pm as they open at 5. We got a nice little spot beside the window where it was quiet and a great view of the resto.  We decided to share the nems which were fantastic and the shrimp tempura that came with a peanut butter sauce that I Just loved. Both appetizers come with a little salad with pickled carrots and beats which really pops in your mouth.   For the mains we got the chicken shrimp pad Thai which was so big I had to bring more than half of it home.  By the time we were leaving the restaurant was packed with a line up at the door."}
{"text":"Called to make a delivery, but they said they don't. Then why state that you do on Yelp??? Waste of time."}
{"text":"The food is great! Only downside is the menu doesn't well describe the options, so it can be difficult to choose. That said, we've loved almost everything we've had here, and the menu is extensive and varied enough to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"We have been getting food from this place ever since we moved in to the area last year. A low key take out place n dine in. Although the portion is a bit smaller compare to most Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto, but the lady there can def cook tasty food. Try their veggie spring roll, rice and grill chicken + pork chop and any meat stir fry - so delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here with my family since I was a kid and the staff greets us by name and knows our favourite dishes. Thankfully, very little has changed in the food department. The beef with lemongrass served on vermicelli always hits the spot and makes for quite a filling meal. The Banh Xeo (Vietnamese crepe filled with sprouts, shrimp, and pork), while a bit messy (I'm told one is supposed to eat it wrapped in lettuce and then dipped in the nc chm - fish sauce), and even though I hate eating food where my hands have to get dirty, is a winner.  Imperial rolls are meaty and plump, and the right kind of crispy. The selection of pho is pretty extensive and they are all worth ordering. Hoai Huong also has massive platters of do-it-yourself platters that are meant to be wrapped in rice paper. My dad and I often share the bo la lot (beef wrapped in betel leaf) and then placed into a freshly soften piece of rice paper with any combination of rice noodles, fresh greens, mint, etc. and dipped in the accompanying sauce. Oh, and if this all of this wasn't enough food, why not try the three coloured drink (various jelly and red bean in coconut milk) for dessert."}
{"text":"I love this place. My nails salon just down the street ,which close enough for me to come every 2 days. I'm Vietnamese and i love this place. I would suggest \"Bun Thit Nuong\" to everyone. They made the best Bun Thit Nuong in the world :)"}
{"text":"Incredibly flavorful dishes, large positions and beautiful plating. Staff are also amazingly friendly. Nice place to go! Very accessible by météo - only 2 minutes walk from orange  station côte-saint-catherine."}
{"text":"Oh my...if you're a Pho or Vermicelli lover, this is the place to be. My first time here tonight and I love this place?? Right now it's 9pm on a Wednesday night and this place is packed!! Glad that a local friend end of mine brought me here. I'll be back and can only recommend this place."}
{"text":"Feels like someone's home, authentic and family oriented.  Unfortunately quite often their kids are in the restaurant; loud and annoying.  Most importantly, the food is really tasty.  Great one size chicken PHO (chicken soup).  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is probably the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant I've been to in Montreal. Born and raised in Vietnam, I'm very picky with my fish sauce (nuoc mam) and Hoai Huong's got it! Their #17 grilled pork + spring roll vermicelli hit all the right spots. The service was quick and friendly. I will definitely come again the next time I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"The service is pretty good. They are friendly and then just leave you to your meal.  Must be family run because they had their own table with their own food and belongings.  Food came our fast and hot! It was really good too, first time in awhile I wanted to finish the entire broth. There was a good amount of noodles and meat also!  Overall, a pretty good place to get Pho!"}
{"text":"Traditionnellement, quand je vais dans un restaurant vietnamien, je prends une Pho au boeuf saignant et 2 rouleaux impériaux. C'est donc ce que j'ai pris chez Hoai Huong.   Les rouleaux, pas mal les meilleurs que j'ai mangé dans mon souvenir. Au lieu d'être frits à texture lisse, ils étaient frits mais avec des petites bulles.. j'imagine que c'est dû au papier qu'ils utilisent pour les rouler. Ils sont gros, bien remplis et très goûteux. (tellement qu'on s'en est commandé à nouveau!)   Ma soupe, je dois dire que j'ai pas raffolé. Elle était ok, mais sans plus. J'ai du mettre un peu de sel pour tenter de rehausser le goût. Je dois dire que je suis difficile quand vient le temps de juger une soupe tonkinoise, mais tsé, pour moi, faut que ça goûte!  Le décor. J'ai l'habitude au standard de pas mal tous les restos vietnamiens, déco un peu sketch et pas particulièrement propre, mais au Hoai Huong, c'était une coche plus classe que ça. De belles nappes blanches et de beaux cadres de peinture à l'huile. Ça \"fittait\"!   La facture. C'est là que j'ai sourcillé un peu. Omettant la commande supplémentaire de rouleaux, j'ai presque dû débourser le double de ce que je paie à mon spot habituel. J'suis pas prête à payer ça pour un meilleur décor tsé. Par contre, c'est clair que j'y retourne pour les rouleaux!"}
{"text":"Best spring rolls I've ever had.   The pho was ok, but I found it didn't have much flavor.  The service was humble and very polite.  I will definitely be returning - perhaps just for the amazing spring rolls."}
{"text":"Nice Vietnamese Resto, good food and nice terrace for the summer. Recommend for lunch if you happen to be in the area. I ordered #2 spring rolls and #31 3 specialties of beef. Fast service and very polite."}
{"text":"This is the place you go to order the Special dishes on the menu. It's easily accessible by car with parking on the surrounding streets or a 2 min walk from metro Cote St-Catherine.   On weekday nights, it's relatively busy with most tables full so I can imagine it being busier on weekends.   Service was prompt, maybe too prompt cause we didn't even get time to think of what to order. If that's you, then I'd recommend going with their specialities which are the #1 Imperial Rolls, and specialty dishes #41 and #22.    In the #22 BANH DAP THIT NUONG, the pork is grilled to perfection, cut up in strips so you can wrap them in the rice wrappers laid over a bed of crispy shrimp chips. Add some trimmings like mint leaves and sprouts.... Use all your willpower to hold that little wrap together with your ninja chopstick skills and go ahead and dunk it in fish sauce.  The flavors just blend so well together!! This dish gets a 5/5 for me!  It's a no brainier dish--everyone in the Vietnamese family of six sitting next to us each ordered the same plate!   The #41 COM SUON BI CHA has a trio of Viet foods to try: a sort of quiche which you're supposed to chop up and eat with the rice, doused with fishy sauce, shredded pork which also is to be mixed into the rice and grilled pork cutlet. There's a spoonful of green onion & oil that you also gotta incorporate into the rice. Phew... Sounds like a lotta work but it's worth the flavor it produces!!  I recommend tackling the pork cutlet while it's hot cause it slowly dries out when cooled.   Their fish sauce is a bit blander but that's entirely my opinion cause I'm used to eating a more concentrated fish sauce.   The #19 BUN BO XAO XA is quite good. I like how they have chopped mint leaves with the beef. The flavor is slightly sweet and you can really taste lemongrass. One thing they don't have is pickled daikon.  I would've preferred the beef more \"grilled\" whereas this tastes a bit more like it was sauteed. It gets a 4/5 for me.  For dessert, if you're not already stuffed, try the #7 CHE BAY MAU with 7 different beans and jellies iced dessert.   My mom liked the food so much we went back the next day to try the other items! Definitely will go again."}
{"text":"It's decent and worth the quick Vietnamese craving if needed. I've tried the pho and rice dishes where and they do the job but are nothing overly spectacular."}

{"text":"I took my girlfriend out for dinner on Sunday evening. The place was empty and there was only one server.   Pros: + Decent price  + Big portions  + Good quality of food   Cons: - Place looks sketchy  - Place was completely empty   Atmosphere: 2/5 stars  - Place was very boring, no music playing in the background. Only muted TV on CP24. - plain old school furniture, no decorations on the wall, no paintings.  - It felt like we were in a cheap cafeteria.  + Place was however neat and clean.   Service: 2.5/5 stars  - The server did not speak good english and it was difficult to understand what was the size of the portions.  - The server was at the kitchen most of the time and we had to wait a while in order to ask her questions about the menu.  - The server never came back after the initial order to check on us and see if we needed anything else.  + However, overall the server was very friendly and she always smiled.   Food: 4/5 stars  We ordered spring rolls as an appetizer and they were very delicious. There were 4 spring rolls and a very small side salad. They were just over $5.  We got two phos which arrived in giant bowls. The soup overall was good, maybe a little bit salty. The meat was overcooked slightly.  Each of the pho was $8. The whole experience with tax and tip cost 25$ for two people without drinks.   We would go there again in winter when we were craving a warm meal."}
{"text":"Pho is good here. It really does feel like an authentic hole in the wall that someone's mum turned in a place to get fed.  The pho is good - it's got great flavour. The best pho i've ever had has both flavour and depth....the pho here is just missing that depth. But value wise, flavour wise, service wise, good spot."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and dinner a few more times since my last review. Their food is consistent in taste and always mouth watering (though a bit salty). The menu has a large selection - prices have gone up ~10% since my last visit unfortunately. They handled my reservations for a large group (~10 persons; 1st time going in such a large group here) without trouble. Service was incredibly fast (served within minutes of ordering even though the restaurant was at full capacity). Very impressed so far. A safe choice for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Our group was craving for some Vietnamese after a long airplane trip back to Montréal so one of us suggested Hoai Huong. Since I haven't eaten anything much for an extended amount of time I went for the extra large bowl of pho dac biet (all dressed) but when the bowl came it was a large sized. I was a bit dissapointed by the service but my tummy was growling too loudly that I didn't bother asking for a bowl size change. Everything in my pho wasn't bad but just average. The broth wasn't too impressive and that's coming from someone who was quite hungry. I've tried their other dishes too and some of them were quite tasty but there are too many other Vietnamese restaurants typical to this one to make it stand out. Hoai Huong is the kind of restaurant with a mini Buddha statue besides a bowl of guava candy."}
{"text":"I see mixed reviews, maybe because of different expectations of what is \"authentic\".  My family of five (Americans who regularly eat Chinese) enjoyed their orders.  You can't go wrong with any of their combo meals, and the meats were so tender and tasty.  I also like that they (really) do not use MSG.  It's the only Asian I have had in Canada, so do not have a local comparison.  Our born and raised Montreal friend who recommended it has a very particular taste and it is his go-to place."}
{"text":"Good food, generous portions Good price Service is ok - they forgot to give us water until we were done eating, but the food came quickly Place is clean  We ordered pho, a Vietnamese crepe (Banh Xeo), and grilled pork with vermicelli and imperial rolls.  Everything is good. I had the vermicelli and the imperial roll was huge.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Portions were decent however flavours were just so so compared to other places in Etobicoke. I ordered the spring rolls which I found to be oily and fresh rolls were also just ok. Also ordered their special pho and tendon was tough. That's my biggest peeve if tendon is not cooked properly and fatty as well. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"perfect?everything is good.especially the traditional taste of vitnam food. the music is also great haha"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant offre une bonne gamme de mets vietnamiens autres que la soupe tonkinoise. Ils sont bien apprêtés, on mange un peu comme à la maison. Cependant, il manque une petit quelque chose, certains ingrédients plus coûteux dans les recettes sont substitués par d'autres mins coûteuses. Mais en règle général, les recettes sont bonnes."}
{"text":"Simple and authentic Vietnamese food. Everything we've tried here have been tasty and food service is fast."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese I've ever tried.  We went there yesterday night with some friends. All of us were satisfied. I tried the Pho soup with chicken, the others: 22., 35., 38. The dishes looked well and they had good taste and smell.  Quick service, clean and nice place. You can pay by card, too.  Close to the metro station, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"J y vais quand j ai envie de me rappeler des plats de ma mère :) authentique, excellent, rapide, courtois et chaleureux . J adore ce restaurant familial . En plus le rapport qualité prix est excellent . Bravo ."}
{"text":"First time in the city of Montreal. Went to try this place with my wife and several in laws. Personally came into the restaurant with high expectations since I was told the Vietnamese food here was pretty good. The menu had variety of different courses all ranging from your typical pho and rice dishes to banh xeo (Vietnamese crepes), bo ba mon (3 different beef), etc.. In laws and I ordered the bo ba mon, my wife ordered one of the grilled pork with rice plates. Everyone at the table besides me  got their dish. Somehow my order was skipped and customers who came in way after us got their ordered fulfilled and they had all finished before I ever saw my order. We had let the staff know several times to check for my order and they kept reassuring me it was coming. Each time I saw a bo ba mon come out of the kitchen, it went to another table. By the time I even got my order, everyone at my table was done eating. It created an awkward environment because now everyone has to wait for me to start eating. I know it is an asian restaurant and service generally sucks, but not getting our order complete before customers that came after us who ordered the same thing is ridiculous.   The rice dish my wife ordered was mediocre at best. The pork chop in my personal opinion was overcooked and dry. The cha trung (egg meatloaf?) that came with the rice dish was actually tasty.   On top of it all when the bill came, they charged us for a bottle of red wine and beer which we never ordered and tried to play it off. That is some shady business. We had to ask them to look over the charges and give us a bill that details every item we ordered. For those of you guys who eat here, I would triple check to make sure they arent trying to add some random stuff to your bill.  All in all, we would not recommend this place or come back to it due to their shady business practices."}
{"text":"Omg this time was horrible! Service sucked and the food was even worse!!! We came here because my mother really wanted to try their specialty dish. The meats in our soup were spoiled and they forgot my order. When I asked them about it they didn't say much so I told them to forget about it. About 5 minutes later the waiter came out with my soup and told them it was 30 minutes late. He rudely replied that it was because the order was placed after the initial order. Ya... 30 seconds late!!! Very rude staff! It's such a shame because we've been coming here for 25 something years. Maybe not every week but still... One more thing... inside the restaurant stinks!"}
{"text":"Not the best decor but very authentic Vietnamese food. Not the best pho but this place has the best chicken/pork chop on rice dishes."}
