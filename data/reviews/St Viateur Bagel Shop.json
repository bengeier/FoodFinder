{"text":"My dad lived in Montreal back in the 70's, and every time he comes to visit here, he gets roughly eight dozen bagels. If he knows he's getting bagels from St. Viateur, he'll often borrow my mom's minivan to drive up to Montreal, to make sure they'll all fit. We've had problems at the border, a lot of US agents who have never had the fortune of going to St. Viateur think we're smuggling drugs amongst all the bagels. But no, there's really just nearly 100 bagels in our trunk. They're that good."}
{"text":"Sesame bagel was warm and fresh. The three topping sesame garlic and poppy was a little stiff though. Might have been better if it was warmed up. Nonetheless great bagels!!!!"}
{"text":"Really very good bagels and thats coming from someone who was born and raised in NY. There really is no comparison because the texture is extremely different and Montreal bagels need to be appreciated for what they are.

We ordered the traditional bagel which had lox, capers and onions on it. It was perfectly toasted and came with a small cup of soup or salad. 

We enjoyed our breakfast bagel so much that we bought 6 more to go-- eating them for lunch and dinner on our drive back to NYC from Montreal. My favorites are the sesame seed and the cinnamon raisin. 

I still love my NYC bagels and like that I dont have to toast them to enjoy them but I can appreciate Montreal bagels and their distinct taste. I will be craving them sometime soon!"}
{"text":"My first breakfast in the city of Montreal was spent here. It was a superb choice. I highly recommend the cinnamon chai tea as it was excellently made.

I ordered the ham, egg, and cheese bagel sandwich with a side salad. The salad took a little getting used to but the bagel was a trophy in and of itself!"}
{"text":"Impossible d'ignorer cette enseigne présente à plusieurs endroits dans la ville. Les bagels St Viateur sont présents dans les cafés, les épiceries, les restos... Bref cette marque assez célèbre à Montréal, mérite totalement son succès. 

Les bagels, préparés sur place, à la rue St Viateur, sont super bons, moelleux et frais. L'endroit est ouvert 24h sur 24 et propose aussi du fromage frais, du saumon ou encore du Nutella pour accompagner votre bagel. 

Astuce : ils sont tout de même plus frais et meilleurs si vous allez les acheter directement à la boulangerie  situé rue St Viateur que si vous allez les chercher en pack de 6 au magasin."}
{"text":"The best bagels in the world. Period! You might think you know bagels, but until you've had one fresh from the oven with cream cheese you'll see that you were sorely mistaken. 

In fact, one can never really say that they've lived until they've had a fresh st-vie bagel. Honest."}
{"text":"I tried the everything bagel with salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes and capers.  It was the best bagel I've ever had.  It's also the only 11 dollar bagel I've ever had.  Service was great, they accommodated my group of 5 on a very busy Sunday.  It was a good brunch, sangria, bloody Marys and tons of bagels.  Very close to a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Great bagels and are a tie-in with Fairmount bagels for me. Hot out of the oven."}
{"text":"This was a fun breakfast stop during an October trip to Montreal. It was neat seeing the bagels being thrown into a pile after being freshly made. I enjoyed my bagel, though the taste was different from a NY bagel - growing up on Long Island, those were my default bagels, so I may be biased. I did enjoy the option of a rosemary bagel though. I would say this place is worth a stop overall if you're in the area or don't mind traveling a bit off the beaten path. I would give it a 3.5 if I could."}
{"text":"I grew up on these. They are my late-night drunk food. They are the go-to's that I bring on weekend trips and brunches. No other bagel can compare to the awesomeness of a St-Viateur sesame seed bagel. Especially when fresh, piping hot and slathered in cream cheese."}
{"text":"A narrow bagel-producing cavern on Rue St. Viateur. Bags upon bags of flour stacked near the door, a long table in the back with about a cubic meter of dough on it. A man cuts off long strips with a wire, rolls bagels off the end. A second man tosses them into the oven, and pulls them out a dozen at a time on a long wooden paddle.

Huge bins for wholesale, but you can (and really should) go in and pick up a few hot ones to eat immediately. They sell a bit of cream cheese in the fridge, and its only 60 cents per hot fresh sesame treat. I recommend staying close by while you eat, we ended up going back in for seconds and thirds."}
{"text":"Food
- This is a must when you visit Montreal
- Its a 24hr joint
- Bagels are always being made fresh
- At night, the selection is limited, but regardless the bagels are amazing
- Bet you can't just eat one
- Great selection of cream cheese and dips as well
- Prices are great too

Service
- No complaints and for it being late, the staff was pleasant to deal with"}
{"text":"Ouvert 24/7!!!
Open 24/7!!!
Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fresh bagels right out the oven. Some are so hot that you'd have to wait for it to cool down before you take a bite. I couldn't believe such a place existed in North America. The boys working there were super friendly and nice. The 5 stars are not capable of describibg how amazing this store, the staff and its neighbourhood were. Loved it."}
{"text":"This is the wholesale bakery of the world famous St. Viateur Bagel Shop.  

THEY ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC

If you need to come up with serious dozens of fresh bagels in an instant - this is the place.  No, they don't have all of the nice little extras, but what did you REALLY come here for anyway?

But wait - Hate to wait? 

On Saturday and Sunday morning when the lines are REALLY long at # 263, a leisurely stroll down the block will get you as many of those fresh hot beauties as you can carry!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! I've been wanting to visit here for years. I wasn't sure what to expect as I'm accustomed to Vermont bagel shops, where most order toasted and with cream cheese. You basically order your bagels to go, 1 to many dozen. You can grab a cream cheese to from the cooler. I asked about coffee and the lady at counter said we can get an awesome latte and eat our bagels down the street at Cafe Olympica. Which is what we did. Our bagels were fresh and warm, right out of the wood fired oven! We pulled them apart and dipped them in the tub of Greek cream cheese I bought. I do you think it was funny that they had to Philly cream cheese as an option considering we were in Montreal and what looked like a Greek/Jewish community. We brought home six with us and two days later they're all gone but one I wish I had more. Next time I will be buying a couple dozen to split and freeze at home. A little out-of-the-way but definitely a classic Montreal must taste!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever eaten almost three bagels in one sitting. That's wrong, right? I mean, people eat 2,3,4, donuts in one sitting, so why not bagels? I'm just comparing shapes here, people. I have to say though, the only place that has ever led me to the verge of gluttony was St. Viateur Bagel Shop. I really don't enjoy pointing fingers, but I have to blame them for giving me my two dozen while they were still warm. This just set me up for a downward spiral of bagel shame. They are just so delicious you can't eat just one when they are that fresh! However, when they are a day or two old, I can easily refrain from eating more than my standard serving of one. 

The bagels are made fresh at the shop every day, and you can even spy on the dudes in the back working away. Made there, sold there - plain, poppy seed, whole wheat, sesame seed, cinnamon raisin - stop me now! Grab a dozen or two and you're set for at least a week...unless of course you're weak like me...and you keep telling yourself, \"Just one more...then I'll stop.\" Addictions are bad."}
{"text":"There is a reason Montreal bagels are famous. Make sure to ask for a hot one, ooh my goodness the best bagel I've ever had!"}
{"text":"A must-go when visiting Montréal. Amazing bagels. All the flavors are great but the Rosemary Olive Oil Sea Salt is my fav."}
{"text":"Located in Mile End, there's two bagel shops that are heavy in tourist attraction when in Montreal. How did we choose which one?! Since St Viateur was within close proximity to the shops we were most interested in, we made our way here. 

We initially passed it since there were no flashy signs, long lines or crowds. The shop is super small for grab and go, but they do offer other breads/pastries if that's something of interest. I was SO tempted to buy a streudel, but I was here with a mission to try the bagels.

Word on the street said sesame and everything were most popular choices, so my friend and I got them. We didn't see any special flavored cream cheese, but these do come at an additional charge. It's about $0.50/each and a single bagel is less than a $1.

Since we enjoyed them on the spot, the bagel had a doughy center with a crisp shell. It was perfection! Sesame had a lightly toasted and nutty aroma, but like the everything bagel, you're gonna leave a trail of seeds/seasonings. Everything had a nice texture with a light onion aftertaste. Not bad, but I preferred sesame.

Definitely a spot worth checking out. We walked by the competition and it was a line out the door. Pending on what you want or how hungry you are, do your research and pick the one that's best for you!"}
{"text":"Best bagel of my life!

Dragged a friend with me through the snow for a bagel.

Fresh hot sesame bagels with salmon pâté! 

Smaller and less dense than a NYC bagel, a crispy on the outside. The salmon pâté was a flavor bomb, and I would take it over lox cream cheese any day.

Their bagels are not as tasty cold, so definitely go for what ever bagel is coming out of the oven."}
{"text":"S'il y a une place où acheter ses bagels, c'est bien celle-ci! Des bagels tout frais, comme le pain dans une boulangerie artisanale. On s'est déjà que notre achat sera direct sorti du four étant donné le succès que connait ce commerce. Fraicheur garantie, les amis!
De plus, c'est un réel plaisir de voir les bagels se fabriquer sous ses propres yeux, voir le tour de mains de ses messieurs.
Bonne dégustation!"}
{"text":"This is a no frills basic bagel shop where you can see them pull freshly made bagels from the oven into open baskets for your chewing pleasure.

A small counter for the cashier and refrigerated area for cream cheese etc. are squeezed in on the side like an afterthought.

No sandwiches here, you have to go to the cafe for that. But service is friendly and you can't beat a fresh bagel.

Knocking down one star because the parking situation is ridiculous. 

This seems like a Montreal must-do though. I still want a lox bagel so would visit one of their cafes next time."}
{"text":"I don't know how to really write a long review here because this place is simple and to the point.

Delicious, fresh bagels at a super decent price. That's it! They also sell juices, water, and soft drinks as well as cream cheeses (even individual packets), hummus, and yogurt.

It's definitely a place I try to stay away from, but on nights when we do go, it's bagelmania. Why do I stay away if it's so good? Because, unlike those lucky ones among us who can inhale 5 bagels a day and not gain a pound, all I need to do is just look at one, and I feel my jeans tighten..... 

But really, go. If you like bagels, you'll like this place!"}
{"text":"The best bagels in Montreal! Cash only. You can put cream and and a knife/spreader if you can't wait to each your bagels at home. There is a single table in your way out to prep it if needed. 

Loved the crunchy outside and not too much breading. It was perfect for me!  Love love love!"}
{"text":"The busy atmosphere and the wood burning oven tell it all. Montreal bagels must use a wood burning oven to be authentic. The bagels are fairly priced $10 for 12 bagels. For handmade and fresh bagels. They have nothing to hide they place all their ingredients stocked high in front of their store from the flour they use to the dough they make. Everything is open for you to see to make an honest bagel."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a bagel this good anywhere. A local reviewer recently recommended getting the sesame, fresh, and eating them soon after, and it's true that they just aren't the same the next day. But you can stop in pretty much any time of day, any day, and get sesame bagels that are still warm from the oven. The seeds are perfectly toasted, and the aroma hits you as soon as you walk in the door of this spot. The texture is slightly chewy, more dense than bread but lighter than the super-doughy commercial bagels you'll find. Addictive."}
{"text":"Never liked bagels, but those were out of this world... my husband and I ended up eating two each they were so good and then we went back and bought more!"}
{"text":"The bagels are good but not great. The lox we bought there was delicious. It was the  $13 one. Definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sesame bagels. But don't buy anything else. We walked in and had few sesame ones. We ate them outside. They were so good that we decided to get more. We order few different ones. We got everything bagel, raisin and rosemary. They weren't good at all. The consistency and taste wasn't there. I couldn't believe they came from the same shop. Next day we got sesame and they were just as amazing."}
{"text":"This place has Sesame bagels that are made fresh constantly. They were light, but delicious. We took a dozen to go and they just didnt hold up very well after a couple days. Once they lose their softness, they are just average bagels. I recommend grabbing a bagel here if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and still these bagels are high on my list! The sesame bagel is mass-produced here for good reason. If you go before noon, the sesame bagels are freshly made constantly, so you can get one and eat it fresh and hot out of the oven. I personally like the everything bagel the most and think that if you can bring it home to toast it would be just as good if not better than the sesame one. What makes these bagels special is that they're covered with toppings all over, not just on one side."}
{"text":"I like the setting of the shop where you can see how they make the bagel. It's also really cool to see the mountain pile of bagels coming out of the oven. 
Not sure if this is the best bagel ever, and I still have to decide if I like the honey sweetness in Montreal bagels. Still, the chewyness of the bagel is top notch and better than most bagels I have had in the US!"}
{"text":"I  have lived and eaten bagels in New York for 23 years of my life.  I know I will get sh** for saying this but the bagel I had from St Viateur was the best bagel of my life and it haunts my dreams every night. I has a sesame bagel with lime and coriander cream cheese.  I shared it with my boyfriend, which I regret.  If I ever come back to Montreal I will have many of these bagels and will not share with anyone."}
{"text":"Had to try these when visiting Montreal! I enjoyed these more than Fairmont bagels. They were crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside with a almost sweet aftertaste. Very different than the NYC bagels I am used to. I'm glad I gave them a try! When in Rome! I don't need to go back but I would recommend this to people visiting Montreal for sure!"}
{"text":"Great sesame bagel. Tastes like Chinese style fried dough balls when eaten fresh, but the resemblance goes away within 15 min as it cools down.

To try: other bagels, fresh or at room temp."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times even though I'm not from Montreal but every time I visit I have to go at least 2 times! What a gem this place is. I am in love with their cinnamon raisin bagel, but all of them are equally as good. I always buy a dozen to bring back home. My recommendation is for you to buy a bagel and a small package of cream cheese or hummus from them, and then sit outside on the bench and eat it. it's the best and most satisfying way to eat their bagels!! I will continue coming to this bagel shop whenever I'm in montreal again"}
{"text":"A lot has been said about NY vs Montreal bagels. I want to say that while there are similarities, these are not the same. Montreal bagels are sweeter and denser. St-Viateur Bagel is a great place. What they do is make and sell bagels. You walk up, pick what you want, and leave. They sell cream cheese and will give you a knife. They also sell salmon. They do not make sandwiches for you - think H&H in NYC and you get the picture.

The line moves quickly, and you are treated to watching the people shape the bagels and cook them in the wood-fired oven as you wait. 

If you are a fan of trying local foods and don't mind a slight detour out of the normal touristed areas, this should be on your schedule of things to do while in Montreal."}
{"text":"Bagels were crunchy and chewy, vastly different from the bagels I've eaten in LA. I enjoyed them very much. You can also buy a single serving of either cream cheese, butter or Nutella. No seating is available. Highly recommend this place for a different bagel experience!"}
{"text":"My coworker is from Montreal and lives near here.  When we dined nearby, he said we HAD to stop afterwards and get some \"montreal bagels\".  I was kinda full from the meal, but I went along.  He bought a dozen to take back to his family and he bought another half-dozen for me to take back to the office the next day.

Let me describe this place as \"an authentic, ethnic bagel shop\".  There is little fanfare or decor, except the sign that says they have been open since 1957.  After one bite (mind you it was next morning), I can see why my coworker says there is a line out the door most times.

These guys handmake bagels and cook them in a wood-fired oven - by the hundreds.  The pricing is so cheap (the 18 bagels were $11CAD I think).  I had seasame seed and he got poppyseed.  They also sell cream cheese and salmon fixins.  Honestly the bagels are so good they don't need anything (I didn't even toast mine).

When I showed up at the office the next day and offered up my six bagels, I was lucky to snag one before they disappeared in 2 minutes.  Next time I am in the area, I am definitely going back"}
{"text":"Hands down the best rosemary olive oil bagel I have ever had in my life. I ordered a half dozen to take home to my family, they stayed so fresh and delicious if I could pop back in Montreal every time I had a bagel craving, I would."}
{"text":"St-Viateur Bagel Shop is an Institution it's that good. Since 1957, 24/7 they've been pumping out amazing Bagels, selling over 1000 a day.

   I've been coming here since I was really young and I remember  Joe the owner was always cracking jokes and let me make my own bagel, dip it in the Honey Water and put it in the wood burning furnace, and get to eat some dough.. Yumm.

   This place is just the best and the workers love their job and put Love into the Bagel, that's why it's that tasty.
 
 It's light and Crunchy on the outside, chewy inside, delicately sweet, and depending on your preference the Poppy, Sesame, Plain, All Dressed all have different overall tastes to them, so pick your Fav! Also they have a good selection of cream cheese, Hummus, butter, and beverages if you plan on having a Picnic.
   
My favourite is the Sesame seed Bagel fresh from the oven, just plain.  When buying the dozen ( or more) and bring it home , cut them in half and freeze them. That way you just pop the frozen bagel halves in the toaster and it comes out tasting fresh. Their website also offers info.
 
  I also strongly suggest bringing the Montreal Bagels on your trips, they make great gifts. The Montreal Pierre Trudeau Airport when flying International offers the  St-Viateur Bagels in sandwiches and Bagels for sale by the half Dozen/ Dozen, so if you forget or don't have time to pick up your presents, here's your chance!
 
  Yes I love this place and will be back as long as its still making Fresh Montreal Bagels.  This is a place I would take my kids when I have them.


** Featured on The Layover , Antony Boudain Recommends: St-Viateur Bagel Shop
\"One of the best examples of the local style (of bagels), St-Viateur's hand-rolled, wood fire-baked, using the same Eastern European recipe they brought over half a century ago. They're very, very good.\"  **"}
{"text":"PERFECTION! It almost seems ridiculous to write a review about an institution like St. Viateur but I guess there's still people out there that haven't had a bagel (or 6) from here. If you're not familiar with Montreal bagels or bagel shops you may be a little surprised. St Viateur is a 24hr bagel shop, they sell bagels, cream cheese and little else. There's no ordering your bagel as a sandwich, no selection of cream cheese flavors mounding in the case, no fried eggs on them, I'm not sure they even sell coffee there ... and there's no seating, this isn't a dining destination, you order and then leave, you can stand on the sidewalk or find a bench nearby to eat. It's not unusual to eat outside or walk around the Mile End area window shopping with a bagel in hand.
  
The selection of bagels always includes sesame and then, seemingly random, there might be an everything, a rosemary or a cinnamon raisin, but sesame is the mainstay. Liberte cream cheese is available in the case and is typically limited to regular and low fat. Bagels are continuously being made here at all hours of the day and night, they're pulled from the oven and piled high, still warm. When you order the bagels will still be warm (they're always warm and should be eaten warm). The technique is to grab a container of cream cheese and your bagels and then \"rip and dip\" as I like to say. I had a discussion with some coworkers, most of them, like me, rip the bagels up and dip them in the tub of cream cheese like a dip. I've heard of people cutting them up but Montreal bagels aren't really suited for making sandwiches with. 

There's some debate between St Viateur vs Fairmont bagels, my preference is St Viateur as they're typically less \"done\" than Fairmont making them a little more chewy and soft. St Viateur always seems to have more sesame which gives them a nice nuttiness."}
{"text":"These bagels are my favorite among many delicious options in Montreal. First off, they've got a rustic morphology to them - the bagels are heterogeneously shaped and have this nutty aroma (if you go with the recommended sesame version). The ovens have clearly been loved and taken care of for decades, likely adding to the interesting finish. Second, the bakers are focused on one thing - making excellent bagels and providing fast and efficient service. Now who can't appreciate that?!"}
{"text":"I'm not just high maintenance and a snob (according to people who aren't afraid to tell me), but I am also a bagel snob. 

I refuse to even consider a Toronto bagel. I am willing to wait for a delivery of Montreal bagels from here, even if I only eat bagels once a year for only one week straight."}
{"text":"Accustomed to my Brooklyn bagels, I was very interested in trying a Montreal bagel. I loved it! This shop is also cool because you get to see the making process. I definitely don't think Montreal and Brooklyn bagels are comparable, but could totally be put in different categories, each being their own type of delicious."}
{"text":"Tasty, bustly bagel shop in the heart of Montreal's student district. Had the 'traditional' bagel sandwich, with lox and all the fixings. Savory green salad on the side. Open brick oven right in the restaurant. Yum! Speedy service. Two things would have made lunch even better: more than just a few poppy seeds on the outside of the bagel, and a moister, chewier bagel."}
{"text":"The second St-Viateur Bagel shop a bit further than the original. Pretty much the same as the other one. Same amazing quality bagels. 

This one is also open 24/7 so bagels forever!"}
{"text":"This was my first Montreal bagel, and perhaps it's simply that I don't appreciate Montreal bagels, or the ones we bought at 1 am weren't up to snuff, but I can't say I'm a fan.  I found the everything bagel to lack flavor on the inside, though it was a little sweet, overly hard and chewy and almost stale, yet missing salt.  The rosemary bagel was aromatic and significantly better, though I still don't think I'll need another given the texture.  I will say that both were much improved with the salmon fume spread we bought to accompany the bagels.  It's still interesting to see the bagel oven and bagels in the works.  

There's no space here to eat nor any tables or chairs or outdoor space, just a simple bagel shop, so grab 'n go.  It's 24 hours so you too can visit post-drinks!"}
{"text":"St Viateur bagels are good. Having been to Montreal a handful of times now, I've never had a Montreal bagel. So here we went.

Chewy and dense and a little sweet, adding some Philadelphia cream cheese (sold separately), it was heavenly.

I preferred the poppyseed one slightly over their sesame favourite, because it was just fresh off the stove.

Too bad they don't make their own spreads such as different flavoured cream cheeses. Also would be great if they added some seats. We just stood and finished our delicious bagels."}
{"text":"Yep, just as I thought. I bought bagels from both St-Viateur and Fairmount. I tasted them, unidentified from which shop. It's impossible to tell them apart! 

Here's my therory: It's like that TWIX chocolate bar commercial. Two brothers got into a quarrel and decided to open their own bagel shop. They are equally convinced that theirs are better. While in fact, it's probably the same recipe."}
{"text":"St. Viateur Bagel Shop proffers an admirable simplicity. Bagels (mostly sesame) are served warm from a giant metal sluice that sits next to a table where an aproned man whacks and shapes dough he then shoves, on large trays, into the oven (whence they spill forth via the sluice). There's a refrigerator case stocked with bagel-angled groceries: many varieties of cream cheese, two or three of capers, half a dozen smoked salmon options, and several salmon spreads; a few jams, butter, and some stuff we failed to note. There's another small refrigerator with non-alcoholic drinks. 

The drawback is that the bagels suck. 

\"Suck\" is too strong, but we'd been advised that Montréal's bagel scene rivals New York's, and that turns out to be a lunatic's delusion. In flavor, this dough isn't far from a simple street pretzel. What a street pretzel has that these bagels lack, of course, is a thick pelt of salt. Any flavor you get at St. Viateur comes from that refrigerator. The bagels give you a warm smooshy vessel for salmon, cheese, jam, etc., thus fulfilling only the most rudimentary function of a bagel. 

It was late, though; we had played a show and everything else was closed; and so we fell onto the St. Viateur bagels like half-starved hyenas stumbling across an unguarded scrum of newborn kittens (must happen sometimes). Given the strictly-takeout nature of the spot, that meant huddling around a tiny ersatz picnic blanket of paper bags on the sidewalk out front, scooping and spreading cream cheese and sawing salmon with little plastic knives no stiffer than stir sticks. 

There's something attractive about the rudimetary nature of these bagels. Like inchoate little vertebrates crawling out of the sea on their journey to articulated limbs and teeth and wings, St. Viateur's product arouses in the modern mammal an instinctive gratitude. That's not to say, though, we'd ever elect willingly to shed our teeth and thumbs, our poppy seeds and garlic and swirls of pumpernickel."}
{"text":"Off we went walking 2 kilometers in the cold for some Bagels 'cause we had Coupons.
These better be some wacked out Rum soaked Belly Dancing Holy Moley Bagels.
Alas, we arrived to this Bagel Shop looking like we just finished running the Ironman.

At least we stumped the Bakers just standing still doing absolutely nothing...
Except we waited for our Coupon Lady to show up.  Coupon not for this location???
Our attempt to stuff this Coupon Lady into the Open Oven didn't work.

We PAID for the assorted variety of Bagels and back the 2 km we crawled.
What must have been 45 minutes after we left the shop, we arrived at the Hotel.
We spread the Daily Offerings on the table and we feasted like nobody's business.

These Bagels are fussy to say the least as it changes molecularly after being Frozen.
The very best was this very first tasting sliced in half with Smoked Salmon on top.

Unforgetable aroma of Sesame, crunch of the crust, interior dough soften by Salmon.
The distinct sweetness of St Viateur Bagel balances saltiness of the Smoked Salmon.
That's how you know you don't have any ordinary Bread underneath Smoked Salmon.

You have a St Viateur Sesame Bagel."}
{"text":"These bagels are amazing.  You can't get them this good where I'm from.  This place is cash only.  The bagels cost about 90 cents apiece.  There is nothing in this place but bagels, a line to get them, and a cooler with some drinks available.   That's it.  You have to go outside to eat them.  There are a few benches around, and the people watching is very interesting.  There was a guy with a big cart walking to and from this store.  I wonder where he goes.  Is there a bagel warehouse down the street? 

I saw some people with bagels on the 80 bus leaving this place, which is as good a place to eat them as anywhere."}
{"text":"Best bagels I've ever had. The end.

But actually. Bagels are such a simple thing that're sold everywhere, but no one really does them quite as well as St. Viateur. Also the place is open 24 hrs. That's freaking fantastic. High quality bagels at any hour of the night!!

They've got quite a number of flavors and options, but I honestly think the plain bagel is the best bagel. The thing about this bagel that differentiates it from other bagels out there is in the dough itself. While normal bagels need cream cheese to accentuate and even flavor the bagel, even the plain bagel can stand alone when it's being eaten here. It's got its own unique taste and god it is fantastic. St. Viateur also has quite the extensive collection of cream cheese, toppings, drinks, etc and yeah it's pretty awesome.

But actually. Best bagels I've ever had. I was struggling when I was reading the reviews between this place and the other place, but I honestly have to say that I have probably not ever had a bagel better than the ones that I've had here. This is no exaggeration. Friends got the cinnamon and sesame ones which I think were fine, but you gotta go plain.

tldr; best bagels ever, go plain."}
{"text":"A must do when in Montreal. Their sesame bagels are so good. 
I love watching them making bagels. Pretty impressive."}
{"text":"No frills, no nonsense. 

Cash only. 

This is the place to try the original Montreal bagel."}
{"text":"They really are that good. So is watching them come out piping hot from the oven. I ate mine still warm, nothing on it, soooo good.

Go here for the best bagels. Enough said."}
{"text":"The most delicious bagels that have been bestowed upon man kind. We tried the sesame & all dressed with artichoke dip. I don't even like all dressed and I stole my husband's. He was left bagel-less and I have no regrets. Almost ruined my marriage. I ain't sorry"}
{"text":"The best bagel I've ever had. Ever. The warm sesame is crusty, soft, chewy, airy, slightly sweet and only $0.70. These blow NYC bagels out of the water. And I was initially a skeptic about this. Go here!!!"}
{"text":"Best bagels that I've ever tasted! The bagels all tasted of love, even after they went hard and a teeny bit stale (pro tip: wrap your days old bagel in a warm and wet paper towel and microwave for 45 seconds)! Definitely eat one fresh because that's when all of the flavours are fresh and amplified at their max. They taste oh so good with Schwartz' smoked brisket and honey mustard! Did I mention that they are also super cheap? I ended up getting a dozen bagels (six sesame, six everything) for just under $10!"}
{"text":"GET A SESAME BAGEL. comes out piping hot from the oven, fresher than fresh, and gorgon inside and crisp on outside. Wow. So good. 

I started with a flaxseed to be healthy. But when hubby got a sesame we went back for second round with only sesame. Yes that's the one to get. 

Best bagel we both ever had"}
{"text":"Definitively different . Not like a New York bagel, sweeter and a little more doughy.

A very busy bagel factory, one of 2 in the Mile End section. They obviously sell most of their bagels wholesale, even though the store is very busy.

They make the bagels eight in front of you."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Fresh and hot right out of the oven sesame bagels that will make you cry with delight. Had them pack up a dozen or so for the trip home. Were they as good the next day? Not even close but hey that's life. I like that they sold individual servings of cream cheese so no need to have delayed gratification."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm so used to eating New York-style bagels, but every time I've had a Montréal bagel so far, it never fails to underwhelm me. St. Viateur is no exception to this pattern, although in my opinion, it is better than Fairmount, which is more stale and less fluffy. I got a sesame bagel with regular Philadelphia cream cheese, and I guess the perks of it were that it was clearly freshly made and the coolness of the cream cheese served as a nice contrast. However, the slightly sweet aftertaste still threw me off and made me question if I was eating an actual bagel or a sweeter pastry. I guess if you're new to the Montréal bagel scene, here is your best bet. Common consensus among everyone that I've met is that you either love them or think it's a bit blasphemous against the art of bagels, so it wouldn't hurt to give them a try."}
{"text":"these bagels are not to be compared with any bagel i've ever had in the States or NYC - smaller around, & thinner, with a bigger hole.  So a bit like comparing apples & oranges ... but honestly, i think these were better.  THERE! I SAID IT!  

Dense yet somehow light - the sesame seeds perfectly toasted - and .70 cents to boot.  unbelievable.  we picked up some liberté cream cheese - a pretty obviously gamble that it's going to be better than Philadelphia Cream Cheese - & a smoked salmon spread - & strolled up to Olimpico Cafe to eat them.  incredible.  we came back again & again our whole trip to montreal."}
{"text":"After conducting exhaustive and delicious study,  I'm going to boldly state this is my second favourite bagel place in Montreal.   I realize that may be highly contested but St. Viateur was edged out only slightly.  It's still tasty though. 

If you are seeking the best St Viateur go here... and don't be tricked by the other location down the street which is just a cafe with the same name.

This place is busy... cash only... and when you get to the front of the line you better know what you want and have cash in hand or the staff will be extremely rude.  My plans were foiled because they were out of a couple of my choices which resulted in last minute mental reorg and if looks could kill I probably wouldn't be writing this review. 

On a return trip I probably would just buy whatever is hot.  The colder bagels were good but honestly nothing worth a long wait for.  Maybe if my first choices were there I might think differently... but I only can only go on what I was given."}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff, delicious food and lots of deserts! Definitely try the tasty bagel sandwiches. You also have an option of salad or soup on the side included with the sandwich. Your trip to Montreal will not be complete without stopping here."}
{"text":"Located in neighborhood of Mile End in the borough of Le Plateau Mont-Royal, St-Viateur Bagel has been makin bagels for over 55 years. They claim to be the longest running bagel shop in Montreal.  They just do 9 kinda bagels, (Sesame, Poppy, Plain, Whole Wheat, Rosemary, Cinnamon Rasin, Multigrain, Flax & All dressed) and boy are they delicious.  Sorry NY friends, But New York doesn't make Bagels as good as St Viateur's. No place to sit here. You buy your bagels, pay (Cash only) & Walk out.  You hardly walk half a block and then you notice \"a glitch in the Matrix\" 
Deja Vu............There's another St-Viateur Bagel on the other side of the road

My point is..... The Bagel's are awesome"}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews about this place and had to try it.  We had our 2 year old with us and he got to see how bagels were made.  We ate everything bagels fresh out of the oven with simple cream cheese and it was delicious.  They have your choice of various cream cheeses or hummus to purchase.  Prices were affordable and the bagels lived up to expectations.  Highly recommended, plan on grabbing another dozen before we leave!  Cash only."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a born and bred New Yorker and know a get bagel when I bite into it. With that being said, this was one of the most delicious bagels I've ever had...EVER!

I was given the name of this bagel shop by friend who had once been. She told me that they're not your traditional bagels, so I'll admit that I was a bit hesitant. The location to which we went was jam-packed but waiting on line was a pleasure. My friend and I were able to watch the bagels get baked in the back, and it was absolutely fascinating. It was like being at a museum, but better - you could actually touch...and eat...everything you saw! I kept it simple with an everything bagel with vegetable cream cheese. The bagel was warm, crispy, and absolutely mouth-watering. It was so good, I was tempted to go back and get another dozen. I wish I had known ahead of time that you could sit down and enjoy a meal here. I would've enjoyed picking some other items off their menu!

Please, if you're in Montreal, hunt down one of their locations; you won't be disappointed in the piece of heaven you're about to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing bagels for sure, but they go from fresh to stale within literally an hour.  Eat them straight out of the wood burning oven for max enjoyment, and they won't even need butter or cream cheese.

HOWEVER.  This is why I take a star away.  They can't be bothered to deal with any of the cream cheese or additional toppings, making it highly annoying when you want to treat it as a breakfast when on the go..  Frustrating, because not everybody is taking it directly home, especially us out of towners!

Besides, surely they are missing out on additional profits by being so stubborn"}
{"text":"This place is open 24/7. We came on a Monday morning before we hit the road back to NYC. There was a line about 20 deep! Line moved and we were able to get our goods after about a 10 minute wait. I ordered half a dozen of all the bagels with the exception of the cinnamon raisin. So got two dozen bagels total. Bummed they were sold out of that but oh well next time! I actually like these bagels more than NY bagels. They are smaller and less dense than NY bagels. My fave are the everything bagel and the rosemary salt Bagel. Def picking up some the next time I come back. These bagels can be frozen so they do have a decent shelf life!!"}
{"text":"They're different that's for sure.  Maybe I'm just a NYC bagel kinda guy, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.  They're dense, hard, and have a different texture from NYC bagels, a bit grainier I think... they're okay.  Sorry Canada."}
{"text":"*single tear*

Wow, so disappointing! At 11:30am on a Sunday we grabbed 3 of these supposedly famous bagels to enjoy outside with our yummy lattes from Cafe Olimpico down the street. 

Our order: 1 sesame, 1 poppy, 1 everything...and 3 mini cream cheese packets. A recipe for deliciousness, no? NO. The bagels were cold, hard, nothing special at all.

Were they having an off day? Perhaps. Still.....*single bagel tear*....very disappointing. Next time I would request \"WARM bagels\" if I were you :)

(Bagel tips for Toronto: my favourite light fluffy bagels come from Gryfe's on Bathurst; my favourite Montreal-style bagels come from Bagel House on Avenue Rd)."}
{"text":"This place is the most bare-bones, to the point bakery in the world. Don't expect some sort of trendy looking place selling overpriced baked goods. You're here for the bagels, and if you're stuck needing bagel accessories, they have those too.

If you're not familiar with Montreal-style bagels, they're not what most people are used to. Most people are familiar with the New York style. Montreal-style bagels are smaller with crispy and sweet crust and a lighter overall texture. They're simply phenomenal with a nice schmeer of cream cheese, and don't even need toasting in any form to be excellent.

They're sold at a few locations around Montreal (I bought more at the Marche Jean-Talon before leaving town) but getting them right out of the massive wood fired oven at the source on St-Viateur is so much better."}
{"text":"This was an eh experience. It's always touted as a \"must\" in Montreal and so many people have told me about it. The bagels were just ok, nothing I'd make a special trip across the city for and nothing I'd seek out. It definitely didn't live up to the hype, just an everyday bagel."}
{"text":"Bagel mastery. Bagel gods. Bagel mafia? Maybe. Bagel artisans. Bagel angels. Bagel dreams. Prepare for bagel serious dreams. Sesame - the classic. Get it hot to experience true gluten perfection. So pillowy. It will melt in your mouth which defies science. You will fall in bagel love and all other bagels will never compare."}
{"text":"So so bagel sandwiches. Not worth going out of way for. Flavours mediocre. Packed to the brim, definitely not worth waiting for."}
{"text":"$0.75 per bagel.  Choose from sesame, poppy seeds or plain!  Employees even offer to take pictures with you :)"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best bagel in Montreal. It's actually one of the best bagels I've have anywhere. Before you get all hype with \"what about New York bagels?\", read on...

It's not really fair to compare these to NY/Brooklyn bagels. They're a totally different beast. NY bagels are as big as my head and while out of this world, I can sometimes not finish an entire one. These old fashion, Eastern European/Montreal bagels are small, thin and crispier. They're very different and I feel besides the comparison of size, they really shouldn't be put into the same category, so let's not even go there. Don't come here ready to compare, and you'll enjoy your round treat so much more. 

These bagels were very tasty, to me the perfect consistency. They had a crisper exterior and a soft, chewy interior. I didn't feel nearly as guilty eating one (ok, 1 1/2) of these babies because of their slim size. They were insanely fresh, hot and right out of the oven!! They are known for their sesame and the staff suggested we try them. That and the everything were pretty perfect. Filled with so much on the outside and very flavorful. They were so great I didn't even want/need a schmear!

The place is no frills, no seats, grab and go! You do get to see the fresh bagels being made 24 hours a day. The process is very cool so take a moment and watch. It's like a tour and shop all in one. Ask questions, they were very sweet and knowledgable.  

 The staff was amazing and personable. I much prefer this place, bagels, customer service and vibes to the other local competition. I'll tell you right now you don't need to go elsewhere, but I understand you'll be just as curious as I was to try both. There's really no need. This is where it's at. Trust me! 

I'm fairly picky about my bagels. If I'm blowing calories and carb loading, it better be really worth it dammit! These were fantastic and will be one of my first stops when I'm in the area again. A must try when in Montreal!

**Apparently people get confused with this location and the cafe down the road. I hear the thing is to just come here for takeout. Grab one of their spreads, packaged and ready in the fridge by the register and a coffee from Cafe' Olimpico down the block and eat outside on one of the many benches in this cute section of town."}
{"text":"Staying in montreal for the summer, I tried both historical locations! No wait, which is a good surprise, and a large selection! St viateur's were fresher, but Fairmount's bagels are my fave. Staff is kind of rude though"}
{"text":"Some of the staff needs a lesson on customer service. Their arrogance is really not necessary. Their bagels are really good and stay fresh for a long time which is nice if you want to take a bag home with you."}
{"text":"The sesame bagels are sooo delicious, tastier than any bagel I've had at home in NYC. I really wanted to try the other varieties but once I tried the sesame, I was hooked. During my 4.5 day long trip to Montreal, I had bagels from St Viateur a total of 3 times. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Sesame bagel with cream cheese. Simply as good as it gets. No need to compare to the NYC bagel. Both are best in class."}
{"text":"If you've never been to Montreal and love bagels, this is the place to go.  Bagels are baked fresh on wooden boards in a wood fired oven 24/7.  Most of the time they are still warm when they bag them for you. There's nothing like a Montreal Bagel.  I always bring 3 or 4 dozen home.  You can freeze them and then defrost and toast them. Once you try these, you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Woohoo!!! Glad that I tried it!!! This particular location is perfect if you want to try both the Fairmont bagel and compare it wit St-viateur's bagel as the shops are only a couple blocks away.

Check out my experience in video https://youtu.be/uPq0WVFhx-o

85 cents got you 1 sesame seeds bagel...the bagel was covered (literally) with sesame seeds! Fluffier than the typical American bagels but still chewy ... The sesame was on point, soooo good!!! They also sell cream cheese and other variety of bagels but we were on a quest, so we only tried one. 

Great bagels!!! Come and check it out yourself!

Ps: we like St-viateur's bagels more than Fairmont's after trying both."}
{"text":"It turns out I am not a great fan of Montreal bagels.  Even *I'm* surprised! I had a sesame bagel hot out of the oven and found it strangely sweet, fluffy, and undersalted.  I found myself longing for a nice chewy NY bagel with crisp crust.  I guess there are two bagel camps...and I fall into the other.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Got the recommendation from our hotel as one of the best places for bagels - definitely these bagels were delicious and are no comparison to what you buy at a chain grocery store. We bought a variety including cinnamon raisin, everything, and rosemary (my favorite). The texture is chewier. Glad we stopped by. Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"As we were coming here, they were filming something for this place so you know they HAVE to be good! When you first enter, you see all the spreads on the right side of you along and straight up is the cashier where you order. We ordered half a dozen of sesame and all dressed aka everything bagels. The all dressed wasn't as fresh as the sesame bagels but it was still delicious! Definitely get it fresh because it just tastes 100x better! I might even say these are better than our NY bagels.. Shhh!"}
{"text":"3.5 (0.5 is for their prices)

Some nut rated this place and five and said they were better than NY bagels. BLASPHEMY!!!!

I know Montreal bagels are thinner, have a larger hole, and are prepped differently than NY/NJ bagels, but honest to goodness, NY/NJ bagels are on a whole other level! I find Montreal bagels so much harder to eat. Where is the surface area to spread the cream cheese? And where's the doughy interior? What kind of 'All Dressed' (or what we Americans called an 'Everything') does not have salt on them? =(

But for what they are this place was good, prices are excellent, the amount of cream cheese/hummus/butter spread selections is great. Drinks too.I was able to walk out of there with a dozen bagels, a large orange juice and some Liberty cream cream for less than $18. Not bad. I must say their cream cheese is way better than Philadelphia. 

Will I come back? I'm not too sure. Maybe if I was stranded in Canada and not just visiting for the weekend.

In a perfect world, Liberte Cream Cheese on NY/NJ bagel."}
{"text":"Solid bagel shop, but a bit too sweet and some of the bagels were a little stale (not fresh?) and doughy."}
{"text":"In the St. Viateur vs. Fairmount battle, I'm team St. Viateur. Their bagels are a bit less sugary than Fairmount's, and the staff is much nicer - it looks more like a bakery, vs. Fairmount which is closer to a bagel factory."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bagels I've had in my life.  And mind you, I lived in New York City one summer.

I'm used to gross bagels that are dense and tasteless as hockey pucks, and I've always hated them and avoided them.

I feel like I've finally found out what bagels are supposed to taste like.  I don't really know how you can beat their bagels.  They hand make them with all natural ingredients, poach them in honey water, and bake them in wood ovens.  When you get the bagels, they are fresh and piping hot.

I've heard people complain that the bagels are too sweet.  I'm generally on a keto diet so I'm very sensitive to sugar, and I have no problems with these bagels.  Speaking of the keto diet - I'm glad I don't have these back home as I wouldn't be on the keto diet anymore. They're so delicious.  

Anyways - definitely go.  The bagels are cheap, service is great, and they are open 24/7.  What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was a tourist, and on the first night my friend took me out to the bars and then to try the bagels. This is THE place for a bagel at any hour. No frills, as it should be."}
{"text":"Legend has it that there is a bagel shop in Montreal that rivals even the best of the best bagels in NYC.  Well my Jewish bretheren, look no further for all the stories you heard of as a child are true -- St Viateur has some baller bagels that can induce uncontrollable salivation simply upon perception of their fragrant smell.

Tons of flavors, a reasonable price and memories that will last a lifetime. 

No combos, just bagels in their purest form.  You can get some spreads from the freezer and they have plastic knives available for those on the go.  It was worth my $30 CAD cab ride to get them before I left Canada.  Or this could just be the hangover from the bachelor party talking."}
{"text":"Best bagels in the world - better than New York better than Toronto - just come get 1 from the wooden stove and ask for cream cheese and plastic knife - so u can open it up and eat just outside the store. Amazing"}
{"text":"Make sure to be there when the bagels are fresh out of the over and hot. You're gonna love it.

Also open all night, so you can snack on bagels at 4AM if you feel like it."}
{"text":"Je ne comprends pas la rivalité Montréal / NY avec les Bagel. En toute honnêteté j'm'en fou, je trouve que c'est s'obstiné sur des stupidités.  Récemment on avait un débat mon ami et moi sur : Qui fait les meilleurs Bagels entre St-Viateur et Fairmount Bagel. Je dois admettre en toute sincérité ne pas y voir de différences. La majorité des fanatique mange leur bagel avec du fromage à la crème et je dois admettre à mon tour que c'est pas quelque chose que j'aime. J'aime mieux le fromage de chèvre genre le Sabot de Blanchette bien croulant avec une overdose de jambon polonais. Sinon juste du beurre, trop de beurre c'est mieux que pas assez.  Je comprends le monde qui dit que c'est plus dur a manger que ceux de NY parce que c'est moins épais mais c'est surtout là que j'trouve que ça fait son charme, j'aime mes bagels vraiment bien rôti, parce que le côté dur et très cuit c'est mon truc. 

Le bon côté? C'est frais, pas cher, la majorité des restants de change nous permettre d'aller plus loin et d'avoir des bagels frais. Le vendeur m'a même dit, voyant que j'étais en arrière de la ligne et n'avait plus personne après moi...je vais te donner des bagel chaud si t'attends 1 minutes. Hell yeah! Je veux dire, directement sorti du four. Bon service, courtois et rapide. Cash seulement. C'est pas mal un petit commerce avec 1 fridge qui a du fromage a la crème, du saumon fumé et voia."}
{"text":"OH! Such a cute place with delicious bagels! The Montreal bagel is quite different from the New York bagel I've known all my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The bagel sandwich combos are delicious with a very reasonable price point to match. I wouldn't buy the cream cheese or other items in their fridge -- that is rather overpriced. However, when buying just bagels, it is extremely well priced, particularly when considering the taste!

Just be sure to bring cash -- they don't take credit."}
{"text":"Si tu habite Montréal et que tu n'as jamais été là... faut revoir tes priorités !

Sérieusement, Les Bagels St-Viateurs sont surment les meilleurs bagels à déguster sur l'île de Montréal. La Boutique na rien d'expetionnelle sinon que son odeur se propage et enivre tout les passants.

C'est une instutitution Montréalaise tout simplement !"}
{"text":"My friends introduced me to st Viateur bagels, and while I am a super big fan of bagels, I was not very impressed. They picked up bagels at 9am for breakfast, and by the time we ate them around 11 they were so hard we had to toast them, and even that didn't make them great. Maybe we were given some bagels from the day before but clearly they weren't fresh. Disappointing considering the reputation of this place!"}
{"text":"Most Montrealers are St-Viateur fans or Fairmount fans.  Personally I fall into the St-Viateur category.  They have a small selection of flavours but I prefer it that way.   I'm also a fan of the wood-burning oven they use to make them as well as the fact that they boil them in honey water.  I always load up on sesame seed and poppy seed bagels when I'm in the area.  The best part too  is that they make them all day long so they're usually very fresh when you pick them up.  It's next to impossible not to eat one on the way home and your car is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bagels as you drive home."}
{"text":"Had an Everything bagel here, amazing! The only thing is this location doesn't actually serve you the bagels (don't toast or add creme cheese for you). They do have drinks and cream cheese packs to purchase if you want to do it yourself. No where to sit though. This location is just to purchase the bagels and you can see them make it from scratch and baking them in the oven."}
{"text":"Good price. Amazing quality. And delicious bagels. I bought 4... 2 for lunch and 2 for breakfast in the morning, along with some cream cheese, and peanut butter and jelly. Very friendly and quick service. The bagels are as good as people say. I'm coming back in the next couple days for another round. If you're in the neighbourhood or visiting Montreal, don't miss these bagels!"}
{"text":"Came here to try the hyped up bagels.  I tried a sesame bagel. Unfortunately, the sesame seeds were were bad.  I took one bite and was very disappointed.  Took another bite as I coudn't beleve it and that was it. Trashed the rest."}
{"text":"Montreal's bagels. everyone telling me about how good they are.... so I guess visiting St Viateur is on top of my to do list for my weekend in Montreal.

This location is the first I visited. Nothing fancy here, bagels... and more bagels.

For this afternoon only plain, sesame and poppy seeds are available. We also pick up some smoked salmon spread to go with them.

If you love your bagels dense, heavy and sweet... these babies are for you!"}
{"text":"Poppy seed bagel, 0.75 each. Smells so good!!!! Soft and yummy : ) I love this area!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"There is no comparing bagels especially not these to a NYC bagel they are 2 different beasts. It is hard to say something bad about these bagels slightly thinner and chewier than their NYC cousins we got our sesame bagel fresh out of the oven and man it was good really good. However to me these bagels lacked flavor or at least what ever it is that I am used to? Honestly though I am not opposed to these bagels they are good no doubt."}
{"text":"Découvert lors de mon escapade à Montréal, sur les conseils avisés de ma sur. Je peux dire que j'ai goûté aux meilleurs bagels !
Délicieusement délicieux"}
{"text":"It really feels more like a bagel factory (so so many bagels). It can be a bit overwhelming if you don't live in Montreal. The line to the cashier goes really fast, so you don't have much time to decide. You can get hummus, cream cheese, and other spreads from the fridge right next to the line. They also have little to-go cream cheese and strawberry jam that you can grab from the fridge right in front of the cashier (it's on the lowest shelf so it might be hard to see). They give you plastic knives if you need them.

It's efficient and quick (no seats), perfect for breakfast on the go or just picking up bagels for the rest of the week. I got the rosemary bagel and it was wonderful. I was disappointed that we visited the last morning we were in Montreal so we couldn't go again. I would definitely come back another time!"}
{"text":"Internationally known and locally respect St-Viateur is for the real bagel P.I.M.P.S. Shout-out to all my hooligans in Brooklyn, but Smoke Meat and Bagels are an OG Montreal thing.

Must visit bagel shop in MTL."}
{"text":"Bare bones bagel operation that's been around for 60+ years and it's absolute perfection - what more do you need than a huge wall of dough, some honey sweetened water in which to boil the shaped dough, and a huge wood fire oven for baking? 

Every bagel is served hot and fresh and ready for consumption. The bagged kind just doesn't compare to getting one hot out of the oven, but once you toast them they get perfectly crunchy again. You can buy cream cheese by the packet (or tub, if you're me). There just isn't anything quite like a Montreal style bagel. 

It's open 24/7 and they pump out 12,000 bagels PER DAY at this location. Surreal!"}
{"text":"very simple great fresh bagels made on site.
you can see and talk to the guys making the bagels.
order a dz. to bring back. these are great bagel not better than NYC but totally different.

must stop and have one there's alway room for bagels!"}
{"text":"Ambrosia.   With the fresh cream cheese they sell in store there are few better food experiences on the planet.  To walk in at any hour and get one of these fresh out of the stone oven is a must have experience. I go here every time I am in Montreal and always bring a dozen back for others."}
{"text":"Il s'agit d'une boulangerie de Bagel. Au choix, sésame, graine de lin, thym, pavot, et j'en passe des meilleurs! On y vend également des cream cheese philadelphia de toutes sortes. Par contre si vous cherchez un sourire de votre vendeur, vous pouvez toujours courir!"}
{"text":"Stellar bagel find anytime but hot off the rack @0130 after an evening out on the town made our night. As good the next day also! The owner and friends who greeted us and shared stories and laughter added to this Montreal highlight. Visit!"}
{"text":"This place is everything. It's for your midnight cravings after you had 5 beers at a Mile-End bar (accompanied with hummus or cream cheese), or is your company for the breakfast next day, or just an afternoon snack because why not. You probably heard of the rivalry between Fairmont. To me, St-Viateur's softer bite will dominate the other one's harder shell any day."}
{"text":"Best bagel in town. Worth the 20 min wait to be seated. Very friendly service and great bagels / sandwiches. Beats NY bagels hands down."}
{"text":"We walked in, bought an assorted dozen, walked out and headed for the airport. We froze the bagels as soon as we got home and there are still a couple left (it has been a month). The one that we toasted yesterday still tastes as wonderful as the first one we ate. These bagels may be the best food we got in Montreal."}
