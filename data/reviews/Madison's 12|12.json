{"text":"Not only were these the worst nachos I've ever eaten, the general dining experience was absolutely terrible. The food came an over an hour after we had ordered it (three tables who were seated after us were served before us) and the server acted like there was no issue whatsoever. We also had to wait for a long time for the bill despite the restaurant being not very busy. This fad of a restaurant will likely not last very long. There are lots of other places in the city to go and spend your money."}
{"text":"The positives: lovely patio in Inglewood, something the community has needed, and an interesting cocktail list with extensive wine and beer selections (as well as many non-alcoholic choices).  Menu is creative and different than your typical nachos fare, but serving size was small and I wasn't blown away.    The negatives:  Arrived 7:30 on a Saturday night to find them out of pork... Which meant 30% of their menu wasn't available... ... ...  I appreciate they are still in early days (a few weeks in?), but honestly, there are enough solid eating options in Inglewood/YYC that a slip up like that means people will go else where.  Even when the full menu is available, the fare is limited...  I hope their \"hard launch\" menu has a bit more variety and selection.  Overall impression: I would go back for cocktails on the patio or if we just wanted a starter before heading to one of Inglewood's other eateries.  But for a full evening of meals and drinks, not so much."}
{"text":"Contrary to belief of Dr Dre and Tupac, Inglewood can be up to some good ;) Case in point, Calgary's first community funded restaurant Madison's 12|12 has finally opened!  Featuring craft nachos, salads, cocktails & beers, you can enjoy some tasty food and bevvies as you lounge out on their patio. Reclaimed barnwood tables and ultra comfy deck couches welcome you here, and there's a possibility you may not want to leave.  The poke nachos are top notch. Chunks of fresh mango, avocado, ahi tuna and cucumber are drizzled in spicy Japanese mayo, sprinkled with sesame seeds and seaweed on a bed of wonton chips.   Make room for dessert too, because their unique take on apple pie in nacho form is something you don't want to miss out on!  Highly anticipated, Madison's did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food but when you serve your customers hot food, your manager shouldn't prop both front doors open (it was -9 C outside) to bring in the beer delivery.  He didn't seem to take our request to close the doors very well."}
{"text":"Rude staff and arrogant management ruined my experience at this establishment. The food was one of a kind, but I cannot recommend this place due to the attitude of the staff. I have been here on two separate occasions and the attitude of the staff and the attention they pay to their customers is atrocious."}
{"text":"Best nachos ever!!!! This place is absolutely amazing. We got the Ring of fire nachos, wild mushroom and truffle salad, and a few local craft beers. All of it was magical. Everything made in house and locally sourced-- there is nothing better.  We met the owner while in there, super nice and friendly and made us feel right at home. Also... the \"booths\" are cozy couches-- with blankets to use!!!! Amazing. Can't forget dessert..... apple pie nachos.... on cinnamon sugar chips."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed bringing my family here, unsure why it is gotten such poor reviews.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Our nachos were so delicious, that when I return, I don't know if I will have the same ones or try another intriguing option.  I had the Korean nachos- very tasty and while I felt like a bit of heat was missing, it was still great.   My son had the Mac and cheese and hot dog nachos that he loved.  Chicken and waffles for my other son was great, what a way to introduce him to marscapone cream, ha!  Hubs had a simple breakfast wrap and while it was likely good, I think the nachos are the stars here.   I may be corrected when I try the craft salads here?  Anyways, weekend brunch also has mimosas on special, $1.50 each- cheaper than coffee!!!  Do I need another reason to indulge in a mimosa or two?"}
{"text":"Great food! Tried the Mexican and Vegetarian nachos. Lots of flavour, the waitress recommended getting mango added onto the vegetarian nachos which made the flavour pop.  Friendly service too. Didn't realize by day they are a cafe too. Really neat concept, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic, all the staff I've met genuinely love working here. And I've never had a bad experience when eating/drinking here. The gin and tonic menu is on point, it describes the flavors of each gin, gives you a suggested flavor of quality tonic, and suggests a variety of either herbs, spices or fruit that pair nicely with the gin. I can't wait to sit on the patio this summer, double fisting gin and tonics! I also tried out the poke bowls which I was originally skeptic about because every other restaurant seems to be on the new raw tuna trend, but I was completely wrong on my original skepticism after trying the best poke bowl I've ever had. I've been to restaurants in Calgary that even specialize in raw fish bowls and they didn't even come close to blowing me away like Madison's 12|12 did. To all the staff that work there, well done."}
{"text":"Madison's 1212 is a great addition to 9th Ave, a spacious patio with comfortable seating (inside looked really nice too but it's getting to be the end of summer so better enjoy the outdoors while we can). Lots of local beers from the surrounding breweries was great to see, we both ordered the sour from Highline Brewing and it was delicious, I really really liked it. The menu is nachos or salad, and since no good story ever started with a salad, we went with the nachos. I felt the portions were decent, nothing crazy but a good size. We shared the Mushroom Nachos and the Korean Nachos without any additional sides or add-ons. The toppings were generous and I definitely didn't feel that we needed to add anything extra, great flavour and unique toppings made for a very delicious meal."}
{"text":"Came in on a weekday in the afternoon... gorgeous space!! Got the mushroom nachos and my friend got the Mac and cheese!  Mushroom nachos were tasty but COVERED in the mayo sauce... which I guess I was hoping was more of a dip, his Mac and cheese very bland, it was a disappointment!   Also we were seated directly where the sun was coming in so I was blinded and overheating, but rather than move us they tried to put papers on the window.   Would try it again in the summer maybe, I think the patio would be great!"}
{"text":"First time here because of a Groupon! Hidden away on 9th avenue across from Kane's diner really have to look! Natchos are primary meal here, they have salads, and the bowls are like natchos just in a bowl!! I forgot to mention they are craft natchos!! So we tried the Mac and cheese with hot dog natchos! My husband and I shared! Out friends had the same but each ordered a bowl!!!  Absolutely fantastic! I loved it, the natchos were just enough to share but I would've preferred the bowl! Groupon specified natchos sooo.... approximately $16-18.00 but well worth it! Fantastic Madison martini, and service was great! We went on New Year's Day and they were surprisingly open. Got busy after 6 pm and they serve breakfast natchos and $2.00 mimosas in the morning!! Drinks are a bit pricey, they have a gin and tonic menu, so that must be their specialty! Ambiance is cozy with open view of kitchen. Will definitely go back I loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I work in Inglewood and come by fairly often. I swear almost all the servers have my long list of allergies memorized. It makes me feel really safe eating here when eating out can sometimes mean risking being sick for days and having to miss work. The food here is fantastic, and the gin and tonics are very creative. At first, I didn't really care for the nacho concept and thought some of them didn't sound great, but each time I try a new kind, I'm pleasantly surprised. The salads here are the bomb too. Very big portions, and just excellent all around. The servers are fantastic, food is great, just give it a try. You won't be dissapointed."}
