{"text":"This store has an unwelcome attitude towards non-Hispanic customers. Worst of all, they sell fruits that are rotten from the inside. Having to take a lot of Biology and Chemistry classes for my major, I am quite aware of various chemical smell, particularly preservatives which I have noticed on their oranges. I wouldn't doubt that they actually inject formaldehyde into their meat as well, since that distinct, smell is present on their meat."}
{"text":"THE BEST FOOD IN THE VALLEY HANDS DOWN! I have been searching for years and I have finally found it. I have never had anything that I did not love. I don't even care about the groceries, I go straight for the restaurant in the back! One of the reasons, I can't move from Henderson is because Cuevas will be too far away. Cannot be beat!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Cuevas thinking it would be closer but smaller scale than Mariana's or Cardena's.  We had a cart full of produce and meat and went to pick up something from the hot food counter.  Guess what?  We non Hispanics were completely ignored.  The little gal behind the counter snarled that she would be with us.  We were the only ones waiting.  A Hispanic couple walked up five minutes later and she ran right over to wait on them while I was still standing there.  We left the cart, went to Smith's where they seemed happier to take our $50.  Will NEVER go back, will advise all my friends and coworkers to avoid the place."}
{"text":"The best carne asada and pollo asada ever!  Along with the Mexican crema (sour cream with a kick), great bbq dinner.  Great concha in the back."}
{"text":"Great carne asada!
Gringo friendly!
Good produce too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!  Great selection on meat and produce.  I have got the best produce here and come just for that, and the carne asada is delicious!!  Wish I would have known about this sooner."}
{"text":"I never really liked going into the store. They provide a great selection of products - especially produce. The cashier is incredibly rude - she is very secluded, not welcoming at all. The extremely poor customer treatment discourages me to return."}
{"text":"I took my mom, a senior,  to this market to pick up groceries.   The store worker who was holding the front door open for other customers walking into the store,  closed the door in my mother's face.   

My mother is African American,  the other customers were Hispanic. The worker was looking directly at my mother when he closed the door to the store.  It is fair to say that this worker has a problem with skin color and race;  if this company has issues serving part of the neighborhood/customer base,  perhaps it should not be in business. 

I will not bring my mother here to shop,  nor will I shop here anymore.  Boycott this store!"}
{"text":"Love this store fresh food  and good prices that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.  The cashier would  get 1 star she started messing around with her cell phone in the middle of our transaction so we stood there waiting for her to get off of her phone so that she can finish our transaction so we can leave VERY UNPROFESSIONAL !"}
{"text":"I love this place. The prepared food is awesome. They have a great butcher, and their prices are reasonable. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice Mexican market!! The staff's are nice as well as the Conchas and my favorite the Chocolate-chip cookies! Omg you need to make more please because they always go by so fast): anyways love this market, haven't tried the meat yet tho.."}
{"text":"A friend on Facebook recommended this place to me and well I am glad I came here. I was looking for cactus pears so I could make jelly from them. Sure enough I was able to find the pears I needed and was able to make my jelly. If I need any other obscure Mexican related items I will most likely will come back."}
{"text":"Large selection of fresh meat! Also a very good Mexican restaurant in the back of the store. It's a gem for sure. If your looking for a good Mexican store this is it."}
{"text":"The produce was great! Cheap prices (stuff on sale) and pretty good quality. The meats were kind of expensive so I did not try this time. I am looking forward to going back. Got beans (not bad), salsa (awesome), guacamole (great), and tortillas (fresh and amazing). 
Looking forward to doing back!"}
{"text":"Great meat selection. Will be our go to for meat from now on. and the restaurant part in the back is amazing. The tacos were so good, can't wait to come back and try more of the menu.
Produce is well priced and their home made salsa is amazing.
Friendly staff. I need to start going here more often"}
{"text":"We love going to Cuevas for produce, and their prepared meat that they have in the back. Their pork is soooo delicious. Whenever I don't have the time to braise, make rice, and salsa, Cuevas is our go-to place for burrito/taco night."}
{"text":"Best place to go for chicken or meat! We always get meats here for tacos. The flavor is so good! There are so many varieties of meats, some seasoned and some aren't. They also have a good assortment of fresh salsas and pico de Gallo. The fresh tortilla chips are bomb! 

The pastries are also very good and enticing. 

There is a little taco shop in the back where you can get some yummy Mexican food! 

There are also fruits/veggies and not a huge supply of other groceries. They have piñatas too!"}
{"text":"This place is a good spot when it comes to fulfilling my mexican cravings! They have really good pan dulce, cakes & baked goods! I enjoy the selections of meats all well. Prices are good when it comes to groceries. They also have food they sell that is prepared and u can sit and eat real authentic mexican food. The  only thing i don't like is this place has rude cashiers they hardly ever talk and don't smile unless, literally feel like im being judged or something its odd."}
{"text":"Honestly, I couldn't decide between four and five stars. If 4.5 were possible, that's probably where I'd rate this place. I've only used this place to buy marinated meat for barbecuing and have never been sorry. Its reasonably priced and tastes delicious. Every time we grill meat from Cuevas when friends are over, they ALWAYS ask what we did to prepare the food. All I do is buy the meat and throw it on the grill. 

The only thing keeping this place from a full five star rating is imprecise measuring at the meat counter. When you ask for 2 pounds, you're regularly getting half a pound more or less. Since its reasonably priced, I just make sure if they error, that its on the over side. It doesn't really affect my overall experience, but is any area that could use some improvement. 

On the whole, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a great market. Stopped on our way out of town?. Awesome meat selection. Goods salsas and sauces. Large selection of produce for a small market. Everyone was friendly and spoke. I will come again. The chopped beef was great in tacos"}
{"text":"I shop here a lot. I really like to eat hot food here. The tacos  and salsa is awesome! The meat department has a good selection. Oh! And the workers are polite too."}
{"text":"Good morning folks!!! I absolutely love to grocery shop. This is one of my favorite hidden gems. Hate to even tell you about it. But that wouldn't be fair to them. On the outside it doesn't seem like much. Probably most would walk by and not go in. But then those people would be missing out. This store is like a Mexican whole foods but smaller and way better prices. Their produce is AWESOME!! Their meat is SOOOOOOO freaking good. They have marinated and non marinated meats. All of them are good. They have all the dried chilies and peppers. Every flavor of jarritos...fresh tortilla chips. Batter for fresh tortillas. Oaxaca cheese......yum. Pastries galore and sooooo good. Love seeing the kids going in and out in the morning getting there sweet bread. It's a definite throw back. This is my one stop shop local market. There is even a mini restaurant in the back that is DA BOMB!!!! Bunch of LOVELY ladies back there making food all day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Some tables if you want to hang out and quite a few do. Stop in have breakfast or lunch, shop for dinner or the weekend, BUY some beer, get some pastries etc. Just feels,like how life should be again.......NEVER LEAVE US CUEVAS MEAT MARKET!!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice Carniceria tucked away in a little plaza off of boulder highway. After the constant ravings about this place from my mom, I decided one fateful day to stop in. I love mexican food and do have fond memories of the little carniceria's in CA. This store, though small is laid out pretty well and for the most part it was not insanely crowded. I thought it was awesome that they have a little restaurant type deal in the back so you can have some good food before or after you shop. I came here for the carne and pollo asada. Twas taco night and wanted something good to grill. The prices were about avg with a regular grocery store. Much like others have mentioned, the cashier upfront blankly stares right past you while ringing up the goods. That's kinda crappy but she's not ruining taco night with her nonsense. Anywho grilled up the carne asada which tasted pretty good, my only gripe is that it wasn't as flavorful as I know it can be. Perhaps the batch I ordered didn't soak in the marinade long enough? Anywho this is a great little are to stock up on all your mexican food favorites."}
{"text":"Just got back from a trip to Cabo San Lucas where we just had some very authentic cuisine for comparison. The food at this market is pretty damn comparable to what we ate there. It is a Mexican supermarket that also serves hot food in the back. They have the usual carne asada, carnitas, al pastor, pollo, etc served in all different ways. I have to say the carne asada was my favorite, only because they didn't serve their al pastor with sliced pineapple like I usually prefer it. Very good overall. Their agua frescas are delicious as well. 

You can also buy marinated meat by the lb to cook at home and the prices are pretty good. 
My boyfriend works near by and I'm looking forward to him bringing some tacos home for dinner now and then!"}
{"text":"Formerly known as Los Compadres,  this market changed ownership for the better, and it shows.     Their new employees can speak better English, and the interior has opened up more.  

The meat market has incredible weekly specials, and every so often the short ribs will come down to 3.79 lbs, and chicken breast at .79 lbs.   But what has me coming back is their cafeteria, which is our only authentic places in Henderson, and I  really enjoy their 1.00 tacos, and 1.50 tamales.

I use to get strange looks coming here, but i usually leave a tip for them...so I\"m now one of their favorite non-Hispanic customers.    Money talks!    Sometimes at night, you might have a few sketchily looking people around the store, but I usually go before dinnertime.    So it's all good."}
{"text":"This place makes me laugh. Reasonable food but the weight in the meat dept is basically at their discretion. To what weight u exactly want to what it exactly weighs. Ordered fresh food and used a supplied bag for limes and cups for salsa but was informed after I was told to scoop myself that it will be extra next time to use our salsa and limes. Dine in only? Scoop it for me then"}
{"text":"We come here for carnitas often for meals at home. But definitely come here for just about everything else if I'm in the area. Do your self a favor and buy the made guacamole and a green salsa. Mix half of the salsa with the guacamole and live your life to the fullest lol. The pan dulces aren't cheap here compared to other spots but it is what it is. They have the handmade mini flour tortillas here too so grab a few of those and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like the place but am a little concerned.  Today, 9/19/14 I used my debit card.  I swiped normally on the customer counter and she asked if it was a debit.  I said yes and she took my card and swiped it on a machine next to her cash register and told me to enter my PIN.  I did but was bothered by the double swipe.  I had heard stories of personal machines used to steal debit card #'s and pins.  Hope I didn't screw up."}
{"text":"This was formerly \"Los Compadres\" grocery store. 

This hispanic grocery store is very clean and not overcrowded as some stores tend to be. 

They have a large butcher shop but the prices do seem a bit higher than most of the other large stores. 

Nice location to get some specialty Mexican items and decent cuts of meat."}
{"text":"The absolute BEST Prepared CARNE ASADA I have had. I live on the complete opposite end of this location, but I am willing to make the drive from N. LV. 

My mother, whom is the absolute pickiest and hardest to please when it comes to eating out, and swears her carne asada seasoning is better than any store bought / prepared or unprepared was impressed with how well seasoned it turned out after we cooked it. 

Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I love this little hidden secret!   Spices, veggies, and a small eating area for freshly made yummies!   

Be sure to get some tamales to go!  They freeze well and are made with white corn!  They are small, but tasty."}
{"text":"Great store to pick up some fresh, seasoned meat (particularly for carne asada, fajitas, grilled meats, and the like) for your party.  They have quality produce, and packaged items that you do not find at other stores.  In the back is a mini restaurant with ceviche that is quite good.  The prices are fair, and the workers are professional.  Not bad at all."}
{"text":"AMAZING every time,,,  I always get the carne asada, salsa, guacamole.  It's totally the best."}
{"text":"Always have what I need and I love the food they serve l, always hot good portions someone's the ladies don't even say hi or thank you when getting checked out ."}
{"text":"Great selection and prices. Incredible chorizo made fresh in the store. Will be a regular customer from now on."}
{"text":"I will never shop here again! The cashier was very rude..I was appauld..by the employees..who look at Caucasians..with mean /dirty looks...I was going to say something to the Manager...but, I saved my breath!  Never again...!!
May, I add , their food products are expired..and the produce...is extremely over priced!!"}
{"text":"Formerly Los Compadres Meat Market #3, Cuevas Meat Market is one of our favorite spots to pick up some groceries and delicious premade foods. We used to only stop in for items when we were planning a BBQ, but Cuevas has become one of our go-to grocery shopping spots year round. 

You will find items at Cuevas you will not find in other, non-Hispanic grocery stores. Like guanabanas, plantains, yucca root and so on. (Disclaimer: I had no clue what a guanabana was, until I saw it at Cuevas, and googled it on my smartphone) The produce selection can be hit or miss, the prices are usually pretty low but sometimes that also means lower quality. Select your items carefully and you shouldn't be disappointed. 

In the back of the store there are delicious baked goods... the pineapple empanadas are my favorite. There is also a counter where you can order hot foods. We get the re-fried beans and Spanish rice from here often. Up front, near the produce, they have delicious pico de gallo and fresh guacamole at very reasonable prices. I don't think I have ever  gone to Cuevas and NOT gotten the guac. 

This review would be pointless if I failed to mention the meat, after all it IS a meat market. The pre-marinated steak and chicken are perfect for your summer BBQs, and they tend to have good prices on other meats as well. 

I am a rather pale 'gringo' that never gets anything but friendly service here. I may stick out like a sore thumb, but I am never treated like on at Cuevas Meat Market."}
{"text":"Love this treasure great carne asada fresh produce and the guacamole and salsa is so good and fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, Im able to find a host of Mexican products I grew up on and they sell prepared food as well. Im gonna be visiting this place more often. Reminds me of home."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE: I purchased 2lbs of carne asada along with $30 of other groceries and when I got home it felt light.  I weighed it and behold 1.15 lbs.  Very irritated, won't shop there again unless I bring my own scale."}
{"text":"Great Authentic Mexican food. The lady cooks Rosalinda, Griselda, Marissa and Patty are always smiling and happy to serve. :-)"}
{"text":"Maybe if they can manage to get all your grocery to you it would be better no joke alway get home to somthing missing.. dont live close so i never go back but its starting to aggravate me!"}
{"text":"Cuevas is one of Henderson's little secrets. You don't have to drive all the way to a Cardenas Market to find a good Mexican supermarket. I've been in here several times and despite being non-Hispanic, I've never encountered an attitude. What I have found is some excellent salsas and guacamole and they are reasonably priced to boot. Fresh chips also end up in the cart along with Mexican Coke more often than not. 

They have a very extensive meat section, and while I haven't tried the cafeteria it has tempted me more than once. I've also bought produce here and have not had any quality issues. I was trained by a group of Italians (6th generation produce sellers) back in Kansas City on how to shop for produce, so if there was a problem with their produce I would say something. They don't have bad produce here. They do have plenty of hot peppers of various kinds though that I like a little too much but they don't like me. It's a love / hate thing...anyway...

In short it's 1/4 the size of Cardenas, but who needs size when they have the essentials for a good dinner and you don't have to drive for miles to get it? Getting carts in and out the doors is kinda awkward but that's about the only bad thing I can say about Cuevas. 

4 Very Strong Stars"}
{"text":"Seriously... the best place on Boulder to get legit Mexican food. I always get the chile relleno and ceviche . They have really good quality meats. I also love love love the juices . I had the pineapple juice last time , and it's great! Great fruits and veggies quality and selection. Very clean and presentable too!"}
{"text":"This place always has the best produce and meat selection. Great prices and easy to find stuff"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times already and have really enjoyed the selections in the market and cafeteria. 

The cafeteria has a wide selection of Mexican food. I've only had their tacos and tamales. The food was really flavorful and affordable! The tamales were $1.50 each. I ate two and was already full! You can't find that hardly anywhere! The tacos were also very good and affordable. This place beats any taco restaurant in the area...I don't think it is very popular because it is inside a market. They don't have a lot of tables and seats so that is why I have always taken my food to go. 

The market per se also has good selections. I think the meat section has great variety and prices. I bought a 8.5 pound pork shoulder for $15.00. 

The only thing is that I wish I could find a bit more variety when it comes to food from other Latin American countries. I am aware that this is a Mexican market but I have gone to other markets that have more variety. 

Anyway, this is a great place to come for groceries and food! Would come back again."}
{"text":"I'm annoyed with myself I didn't go to this place sooner, as it's less than 10 minutes from our house.  The meat selection is fantastic, and I found the prices very fair for carne and chicken.  The produce selection is solid, and as other yelpers note, they carry some rarer items.  There is a bakery and a restaurant in the back with usual items.  I found the employees to be very friendly and even though I don't speak Spanish, I had no issues while shopping.  The butcher in particular offered a lot of suggestions and advice regarding how to cook various types of meat.

There is a good selection of salsas, canned goods, and cheeses.  Very excited we finally found this place, and we intend to take full advantage of it."}
{"text":"Hola cuevas market tienen muy buen pan dulce y buenos productos buena carne. Necesitan limpiar el piso de la tienda porque así se miraría mucho mejor además aquí en henderson es la única tienda mexicana."}
{"text":"Love this carniceria! The ranchera preparada meat is the absolute best! They have fresh produce and the little restaurant inside makes great burritos. Their prices are a little high compared to other places when it comes to their produce and some other food. However, because the meat is so good I'll pay whatever it costs because it's that good!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst place to shop at the vegetables were all bad and the I stood in line for 30 minutes they only have one cashier and the cashier at the food place is very rude, when I got to the register they old me I couldn't pay there because I had a Texas I'd and I told them I'm new to the area so they told me that I can't pay unless I had cash or a Nevada ID"}
{"text":"This review is ONLY based on the hot food section.

Tamales are BOMB! 

Hot sauce- nose drippin hot so it is SPICY GOOD!

Chicken burrito- very tasty. I been to some places and their chicken was either too dry or rubbery and their chicken is perfectly seasoned and cooked. They are not cheap with their meat. They serve it Mexican style! 

Overall, the best in the hood!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem here in Henderson, NV. Wow, what a cool little store. If you want to get away from the corporate shopping experience check this place out."}
{"text":"I love Cuevas Meat Market!  We decided to make carne asada tacos at home recently and I knew this was the best place to go for everything we needed.

First of all, they have great prices on most of their produce.  Most things are cheaper than you would find at a grocery store.  They also offer competitive prices on their meat.  The carne asada (already marinated and chopped) was $4.49 per pound. Although we bought a pound and a half, that ended up being WAY too much.

We also bought fresh, handmade tortillas, onion and guacamole (which I could've made myself, but was too tempted by their brand).

The staff was friendly and helpful and I need to shop here more often!"}
{"text":"Best guacamole ever!  Bought beef and chicken fajita meat from the counter and it was perfect."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite Vallarta (aka meat market)! We always come here for our Carne Asada and Pollo wants and needs! Their marinated meats are out of this world amazing and the prices are equally as wonderful. Also the prices of produce are decent not as good as some of the other Vallartas but they are better then smiths. The other thing that I love about here is the butchers speak English unlike other places when I order they understand me and can answer my questions which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"I love the the store feels so inviting upon walking.  I've been to a number of carnicerias in Colorado and Las Vegas and feel that this is probably one of the cleanest and most freshest ones I've been to. The awesome thing is that it does not \"smell\" like a carniceria. The service is great and you even get a chance to watch the people put your burrito together in front of you in the ask you what you want in it along the way. The prices are great and because I work in old Henderson this store is very convenient for me to shop before I go home. Love this place!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place doesn't look like much but out of all the Mexican Meat Markets in Vegas/Henderson I've been to this one is hands down the best!

It's really small inside but they literally have almost anything you're lookin for especially if you are looking to put together some tasty street tacos! 

The prices are moderately fair. Some items seem to be priced higher than what you would normally expect to pay going somewhere else but not by much. 

The marinaded meat I recommend to pick up is the Ranchera De Res Marinaded beef flaps. I forgot the name of the second one but it's right next to it when you go to pick it up.

I saw someone put a bad review about the cashiers. I found everyone to be alright. They're in their own world and don't socialize with you and normally I would rate a place based off of service level but in a place like this, you're there for the food, not the people so screw it!"}
{"text":"Just an update on the address for your GPS: 524 S Boulder HWY Henderson, NV 89015-7512 (This should take you to the door/parking lot) whereas the 530 address takes you to nothing.  Enjoy!"}
