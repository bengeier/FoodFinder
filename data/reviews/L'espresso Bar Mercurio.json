{"text":"Perhaps my review ought to be considered half baked as I didn't spend any substantial time here and my order consisted of a sole latte to go, however during the time of preparation, I spent some time observing, to the extent possible, the atmosphere of the cafe.  While not what would generally be considered warm and cozy, the environment is certainly inviting.  The batista's seem friendly enough and while the noise level is by no means high, it was a challenge to communicate at a distance of more than 4 meters; although in fairness this could have been owing you vocal volume as opposed to ambient noise.  The cafe was tastefully decorated in a festival manner, however the vintage fiat 500 bordered on novelty, throwing some confusion over the theme that was being attempted.  The atmosphere is in no way bad, and perhaps it's flaws are to some extent charismatic, however the design philosophy glaringly lacks consistency.  The latte itself is perfectly adequate if not somewhat uninspired.  It's objective is met, however it fails to stand apart in a sea of Cafes in the city.  As a result,  the cafe is certainly worth a visit if you are already close by, unfortunately it wouldn't be considered outstanding enough to be worth a trip into the city in its own right."}
{"text":"I wish I found out that UofT students got discounts here before I graduated! That being said, the latte's and coffee are average, but what I go for is the little patio outside. It kind of takes you out of the hustle and bustle of the city life going on right behind the plants and trees.  I've only actually eaten food here once. I went with my mom and we both got panini's. While they were both very good, by the time I got to the 2nd half of mine, the bottom was soggy from the peppers and oil (it was a veggie panini).   This place is nothing to write home about, but I still enjoy it. I guess for me, it's more of a summer place, since I like sitting outside."}
{"text":"Weird vibe.   Some animosity exists between the kitchen staff and the people taking your order. Manager sorted it out, but there was an uncomfortable moment where the girl taking my order cussed out the kitchen staff under her breath.   Got a kale and lentil soup that was pretty much hot water and raw kale. Sweet potato fries were A-okay and coffee with Nutella cookie was decent.   On one occasion we dined in and asked the server for some honey or sugar to sweeten the coffee with. She gave us a disdainful glare, flounced off and returned after 15 minutes. In a pissed off tone, she then proceeded to inform us of where it was located \"for future reference\". We didn't see it! She could literally just have pointed it out. So annoying."}
{"text":"I've made a couple of large purchases here.   Pastries: Love the pastries. Expensive, but very well made. There was this one pastry that I that had a lot of a disgustingly sweet caramel in the center. Other than that, superb.  Bar drinks (espresso): Very well made. Price on par.   Sandwiches: Excellent, but served in an abominably small portion and is very expensive  Smoothie: I did not like it - it was warm, watery, and far too sweet  Gelato: Way too sweet. A safer bet would be going to Dolce on College or in the Kensington Market.  Come for the pastries and latte folks. Eat your lunch / dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"atmosphere + Mediterranean menu + best espresso in the city + fantastic wine list+gluten free pastas and pizzas as optional!   =  the perfect restaurant."}
{"text":"They are rude after you finish your meal. I came at 11.30 am and got my lunch with student discount then started to study. They asked me to leave when I finish my lunch with the pretext there are reservations for lunch but they did not tell me this when I ordered my meal half one hour ago. I would not get my lunch there otherwise. In fact they are student-unfriendly since they think they do not consume enough!"}
{"text":"I love their cappuccino. Unfortunately, this place is pricey, the service is not that great, it can be difficult to find a seat, and with the exception of their treats, which I love, I've noticed that the quality of their food has gone down.  I would recommend getting your coffee and treats (they make delicious croissants) to go."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to see the Vanity Fair exhibit at the ROM and were looking for a good place for a quick lunch. Once again, I turned to my handy dandy Yelp monocle (god d__n, I love that thing!), which led me straight to L'Espresso Bar Mercurio.  The atmosphere was pleasant and we were comfortable straight away. The restaurant is divided with a food case at the front, so we weren't sure how to order. They haphazardly explained that you could either sit down and have brunch (on the large, roomy side of the restaurant) or you could pick something from the case and be relegated to the small, cramped side of the restaurant. We chose the latter only because we were in a hurry, and apparently so did everyone else because the \"prepared food\" side was far busier than the \"served\" side.  I had an egg salad wrap; it was good enough, but I'm fairly certain that it was \"day old\" because the edges of the tortilla were crunchy in parts. We ordered a Lemon Curd Tart and the Chocolate Mousse, and both desserts were very good. They have interesting teas from which to choose and my friend had the Vanilla Rose. They bring you the teapot with a little timer on it and instruct you to remove the tea leaves when the timer goes off. I thought that was a nice touch. The food was well priced, imo.  The service was just meh, although that could be because we weren't on the side with table service. Still, we had to ask for napkins and silverware twice which, to me, should be a given.  The brunch menu looked delicious and I liked L'Espresso enough that I'd probably give it another try."}
{"text":"Its lovely Italian place with Brunch and good coffee and deserts. Good for romantic breakfast or evening drink. Be aware that it is closed quite early. One of my favorite spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is delicious here, but there are some serious problems that make it extremely difficult for me to want to ever go back.  There's nothing wrong with only having counter service, but there's no real signage indicating what to do once you've paid.  Take-out orders are slow and you have to wait uselessly near the area where they make coffees and other drinks.    Today I went in and ordered take out lunch (a panino and the beet salad).  The panino was a good size, but when I opened the salad the box was almost completely empty. There was hardly any salad there at all, and the salad alone cost $13 + tax. I didn't have time to go back and complain, but that's definitely not acceptable."}
{"text":"Can't seem to understand why this place has an ok rating. Way overpriced! Service was so poor, we waited 20 minutes for the coffee to reach our table and about 40 for the food. They were so cheap on the food! The club was so tiny, the lettuce was wilted. The salad we ordered for 15$ would pass for a side salad at other places.  A real disappointment."}
{"text":"I work across the street and come here quite often for espresso beverages (as opposed to the often unreasonably slow/busy, poorer taste/quality, but more customizable Starbucks a block down).  I have to admit that their coffee beverages are some of the best tasting in the area. The service is not as bad as some of these reviews claim (though the staff at other coffee shops are friendlier). The atmosphere is certainly quite nice and I have found the food tasty, though somewhat on the pricier side. My one problem with this place is that as of late, about 1/4 of my cup of latte is missing as they pour it out on the bar in front of me. I don't mind paying $5 for a great, medium-sized latte, but I have issues paying $5 for a great, medium-sized latte that is only filled about 3/4 of the way up, especially when for comparable prices, every other place will fill the cup to the brim.  This, on principle alone, encourages me to frequent one of many other coffee shops on the block that won't try and capitalize on the 2 cents worth of milk they skimped from my latte."}
{"text":"Sorry guys. Gave you another shot. And here's the thing, when a double americano is $3.75, it better be freaking perfect. And here's what I got: to start, the guy making it seemed to take the approach that it was this big hassle for him. Second, the double portafilter was already in use, so he used the spare one without warming it up, which is a big no-no (despite it being cold and not in use, it appeared to still have espresso grounds in it from a previous drink). Third, he ran the shot so long that he had to dump a little bit out so that he could take the cup (which was way too big for an americano) and pretty unceremoniously dump some hot water into it. He then shoved it in my general direction and walked off to do something that was surely more important.   Even Starbucks would have been better. And about half the price."}
{"text":"This place makes a solid espresso (nothing amazing, like at Lit/Crema etc., but much better than chain espresso.) There are multiple gluten-free dessert options for people with celiac disease, and the baristas know to use separate tongs/a napkin, to avoid cross contamination. The service is hit or miss, but if they realize you're not an undergrad, the staff is polite enough!"}
{"text":"Best legit cafe italiano style on this stretch from Younge to Bathurst.  Great lunch brunch, fab pastries, and of course the real thing behind the counter ...friendly eager staff and a silver imported espresso capuccino giant machine for the best selection in town!  Pleasant and roomy and chic."}
{"text":"Average cafe with order at Counter service. I went for breakfast and loved it, nice friendly staff. Went back in the afternoon and found the staff unfriendly. Shame as it has a good location and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Highly recommended U of T neighbourhood cafe and lunch spot.   Service: Consistently friendly cashiers baristas and servers. A lot of people are saying the ordering process is ambiguous, but it's really not once you've been here more than once. You pick up coffee-based drinks at the bar, but all other drinks are served at the table. All food items are served to you. The right side of the cafe is for passing-through customers usually (unless they're full-up).   Atmosphere: Very clean look. Marble counters and tables. The patio looks like something out of a fairytale, especially in early summer months. \"Upscale casual\" is how I'd describe this place, and there's a half-half mix of suits and students. A lot of days, you'll see students working on assignments here, laptops and lattes atop their bistro tables.  Food: So delicious! Their salads are especially great; I'm a big fan of their kale caesar salad. They also have a good variety of sandwiches, and their zucchini fries are to die for. As a plus, they make you feel like you're eating being super healthy. PASTRIES and baked goods are all very good. I'd recommend the ginger-spice cookie, gluten free biscottis, cranberry scones, and brownies or lemon bars. Their tarts are hit-or-miss. Cakes are reliably fluffy and moist. DRINKS here are great. I'm talking coffee and espresso-based drinks, smoothies (go for the green tea blueberry yogurt), and teas. Their coffee beans are super flavourful, and make for great espresso drinks.   Despite the non-supportive Yelp reviews, I'm still a proponent of this place. Can't get enough of their lattes and matcha blueberry smoothie!! Note: If you're a student, you can get 20% off your order."}
{"text":"Joined yelp just to post this. I always enjoyed spying on Yelp to spot out good places, and I felt like I should post this to warn others.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE  I just stopped by just to see what their cappuccino was like, as per the positive reviews.  1. Bad, really customer service. You get better service at Timmies' than here. The servers are rude, very rude. I order cappuccino and a cookie for takeout, but the cookie I wanted did not have tag on it, and the server kept literally barking at us to tell us the name of the cookie, and were actually quite upset when I said that they haven't posted the names on display. My ordeal for just a cookie and cappuccino did not end there. The server did not ask us to pay, and gave us the food straight up. I told the other person on the till that I haven't paid yet, and she asked for me to go back to the lineup and wait.  2. The food is not worth the price tag. The cappuccino is on par with your normal starbucks-second cup, not worth the price tag, nor were the pastries.  Bad experience, overall."}
{"text":"Coffees are overpriced, which doesn't fit my student budget. Cappuccino and lattes and baked goods like cookies and croissants are good but for the price they could have done better. Ambiance is romantic, which is why I kept going back. Coffees may not be as superb as the prices might suggest but I enjoy sitting in the cafe and reading books. They offer free wifi too, which is ideal for those working on research papers."}
{"text":"Stale Cookies. They need to stock less to fill the display and refresh them more often ;( When you spend 3.50 for a cookie you want it fresh.I am a cookie Monster and only once of the all the times I have been there were the cookies fresh...and  I buy several kinds!! I even bought a huge order for my office event and they were all stale. SO ANNOYED.  Too bad..after my 3rd visit with stale cookies I have given up :( The rest of the food I have had there is great...just pricey. too bad for the traffic they get you think they wouldnt rob you....and could re fresh their cookies!!"}
{"text":"Helpful and friendly staff. However, beware what you order on the menu. Fresh squeezed orange juice costs $9. Yes $9 !!!  Total price gouging !!!"}
{"text":"I usually go to this bar because it is very close to my office and it offers lots of tables where to seat and have a meeting. Despite its convenience due to its location, food and coffee is a bit overpriced. The espresso is too bitter and burnt (not sure if it the machine or the beans they use), the cappuccino is tasty but do not expect crazy latte art, I have always gotten a small heart or leaf, nothing crazy. Pastries are good (it may get an extra .5 star because of them).  They offer food and sandwiches for lunch. it is fresh, you can even see them making it in the kitchen but portions are small given the high price you pay. The big pros for this bar are its location and the overall ambiance, I really like the glass wall and the outside area."}
{"text":"Great place to get a bite, sit down and do some work. On weekdays there is no table service which is not a big deal because you don't feel pressured to leave. The pricing and portions are quite reasonable. 20% student discount!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I always enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Located on Bloor Street near the University of Toronto, it is always busy. Many faculty, students and business lunch goers make this a warm place to be on a cold day. I had the Ribeye burger and Homecut fries. The presentation is appealing and the food always very tasty. Getting a table can be difficult at peak times but they do a good job of getting you seated quickly. They also make good coffee and have an assortment of sweets and deserts in the front display case. They also have some pretty fantastic vegetable juices made to order in their juicer."}
{"text":"The way the service operates definitely takes some getting used to, but it's grown on me. Their chicken club sandwhich is delicious. It's classy, close to uoft, in an awesome location (reflected in price), but overall well worth it. Support your local coffee shop and try it out!"}
{"text":"I've reviewed this place negatively before, but it's so close to my house that I gave it another shot. And again, the servers were SOOO RUDE!! Never again. None of the rest matters."}
{"text":"Decent food and coffee. Kale, vegetable soup was healthy but somewhat bland. For brunch, their sandwiches are freshly made but they won't allow substitutions. No cheddar for awful goat cheese. Not sure how hard that is. Staff appear young and inexperienced. I guess wait staff have to start somewhere. Really, it's worth a try but they should satisfy their customers requests when it takes no effort. Cute ambiance. There is a room for larger groups/private party."}
{"text":"What a great place to have brunch! This restaurant caters to a wide variety of needs as it offers numerous gluten free pastries and healthy options. I was also pleasantly surprised when I found out that students get 10% off if they show their student cards. I will be returning here."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the coffee here, since I was in a peppermint tea mood when I sleepily wandered into this place this morning, but I do have to put in a word about the confusingly named \"Salmon Bruschetta\" (accustomed to the ubiquitious tomato/basil variety, this seemed to me to be no more bruschetta than omelette). That aside (since, after doing some research, I have discovered that the rules for calling something bruschetta are flimsier than I thought), it was very, very good. A thin slice of multigrain bread, mascarpone cheese, smoked salmon and two poached eggs: one of those rare close-to-perfect meals that leaves nothing to be desired. If I was being really picky, I would say that the yolk was a little bit *too* runny, especially since I believe I saw/tasted a bit of runny egg white, but overall it was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"Stand at the \"wait to be seated sign\" so someone can find you a table. Once they give you a table number you can proceed to the cash and order. You pay for your food at the cash. If you order food you pay and you may proceed to your table, they will bring your food. If you order drinks the you wait and get them at the bar. If you order both then you take your drink and juggle it with all your stuff as you find your table.  They bring the food to your table. Complicated enough yet? I guess it's pretty simple if you're getting takeout.   I still like the food here and frequent the place. They have a good gluten free selection and you get 10% off if you're a student. The food comes fast so it's still good even if you're in a hurry.   It usually doesn't feel this complicated for me as this nice man (his name escapes me at the moment but I swear I knew it!!) intercepts you in line and gives you a table number. Today however he wasn't here. I got to the cash only to be turned away and sent to the \"wait to be seated line\" somewhat rudely.  I was given a table after the hostess had to explain about 3 times to another group of people how the system works and they still looked pretty confused.   I finally sat at my table, got my food and thoroughly enjoyed my kale and chickpea soup, Caprese Salad and Immunizer drink (carrot juice, ginger, kale and lemon I believe )."}
{"text":"Went there today for a quick coffee and pastry. First it is an offshoot of Bar Mercurio near the Hyatt on Bloor. It is catering mostly to the Yorkville brunch crowd. I had a latte with an extra shot of coffee (because noon is always too early for me and I have to wake up($3.76 plus .75 for the extra shot). I had a mezzaluna (italian version of a croissant, $2.25). It was not as flaky as the French recipe and lacked oomph. I thought the raspberry jam cookie was very tasty and was a better match for my coffee. Since I did not have a full meal I cannot comment on the rest of their offerings.  The decor is very nice and at the time of my visit, still  had a World Cup Soccer, Forza Italia vibe. The waitstaff, all female are all friendly, competent and very attractive and polished. However, if just for coffee and a pastry, you better take out as the restaurant is is a proper sit-down one.  Good if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I really like Bar Mercurio for their coffee (standard coffee, not the lattes), but I don't care for their food or other drinks.  The coffee is good, and I have even bought espresso beans from there.  It is at a convenient location, and I think the coffee is a bit cheaper than Starbucks or Second cup (and better, in my opinion).  I used to really really love the cookies from here (especially the gluten free ginger cookies), but I think the quality has gone down, and they don't taste like they used to.  The last 2-3 times I have tried the cookies, they have been on the dry side.  So far, I've tried the gluten free ginger cookie, nutella cookie, and I think a peanut butter cookie, and I have been disappointed with them all.  I haven't tried any of their other desserts or sandwiches.  I have tried the poutine from here (about 2 years ago), and it was good, but nothing to write home about.  As I said, I wouldn't recommend the food here.  I DO really like the decor here.  They have a very cute vintage car when you first walk in, and they decorate it accordingly (by season, holiday, and depending what soccer team is playing!)  They also have a nice patio in the summer."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast. I tried Panini - Smoked Salmon, brie cheese, arugula, freshly baked barberie bread and it was good."}
{"text":"-The short version-  Lovely atmosphere, kind and attentive staff, and a nice cortado. I also had a Chef's special from the lunch menu: a mushroom, roasted red pepper and chicken crepe, which was also good, slightly too salty. It's expensive here, but a nice treat now and then.  -The long version-  Atmosphere: The space is very nice and classy. Perfect for any casual business meetings, and I witnessed a few.   Food and Drink: I ordered the Chef's Special -a mushroom, roasted red pepper and chicken crepe - for $17. It was good, a little on the salty side for my taste but I was very impressed with the portion size. I couldn't finish it all. I also had a cortado. It's hard to mess that up; it was well done, with some cute latte art on it. Their quality for each drink is consistent: my friends all ordered different gourmet coffees and teas, and the presentation was well done each time. There are nice small pastries to choose from, mostly dry, such as biscotti or cookies. This espresso bar is pricey, one small biscotti was $3.  Service: The cashiers/baristas are very friendly. The server immediately took in my request for a bigger table, despite it being \"reserved\". They don't bother you and check up on you too often, which I liked. There was a 12% gratuity added onto my bill automatically, so I technically didn't have to worry about tipping. Although some (including myself) may not appreciate that, but I think the service they provided me with was deserving of at least that much. It would be another story entirely if the service wasn't good.  Overall:  A nice place for coffee, albeit expensive, so it's not for your everyday/grab-n-go coffee needs. There are other nicer places close by near the Yorkville area...If you do go here, you won't be disappointed, but you won't be in awe either."}
{"text":"I really love the capuchino here."}
{"text":"This place was my go too during my Masters at UofT. They serve great tasting coffee. If you have a few minutes to spare, try their Ethiopian french press coffee, just amazing! Its a \"fancy\" coffee shop with Starbucks / 2nd cup style prices, but way better imo. Their snacks are good too. They have good lunch specials as well. They use very fresh ingredients in their sandwiches and it comes through in the taste! Remember to mention your student status as you will get a discount.   This place does get crowded however, and they have a great patio at the back, which allows smoking. They seem to have a decent drink / wine selection, although I have never tried either. I think the quality is good because most of their staff has been there for a while plus the owners are usually there, so customer service levels are maintained. The head chef is also the owner and they usually accommodate any special requests for food!"}
{"text":"Almost every morning before going to school, I stop by L'espresso Bar Mercurio to grab a cup of coffee. I usually have a red eye. Their coffee is amazing! Arguably, the best around the Annex. Their tiramisu cake is also delicious!   But, most importantly, the staff is the best. Yesterday I was charged accidentally $83.15 instead of $3.15 for a cup of coffee. This happened of course accidentally since it was a busy time when I ordered my coffee. I did not notice it until late night, but once I found it out, I immediately sent an email to the manager (Teresa). She was really quick in her reply indicating her apology and willing to provide a refund. So today, I went to the coffee shop again and got my refund and grabbed another delicious coffee! The supervisor, Daniel, was super helpful and kind. He understand the situation and was able to solve the issue quickly.   5 stars for the coffee, 5 stars for the cakes, and most importantly 5+ stars for the customer service."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times and it is always okay, but I find it overpriced due to the area it's in.   I tried lattes, americanos, and find they're nothing to write home about.   Their tiramisu was randomly really good and I could tell they used mascarpone. That was the only time I was impressed with this place.  They also have a beautiful garden in the patio so they received points there."}
{"text":"Even as I write I am enjoying a blissful soy latte from their fancy espresso machine. This is a regular place for lunch because it's one of the few places in the area where you can take someone for a nice meal and pleasant atmosphere (but brace yourself for how the noise bounces off those concrete floors and marblesque tables). The tab for lunch is a shock but the food has always been impeccable in my experience. A nice selection of baked goods are by the counter but timing is important; they are wonderful when they are fresh and disappointing when they are not. Many are grateful for the delicious gluten-free options. Service is hit and miss and tensions behind the counter (can't we all just get along?) can make you glad that it's too noisy to hear what they are saying to each other."}
{"text":"A very underutilized coffee shop. Being in a prime location and a very decent space, they don't really offer anything exciting. However, if you are looking for a quick espresso or Americano to go, this is a very safe choice."}
{"text":"The place looks very appealing on the outside, but is terrible on the inside. I ordered a burger and fries, and I have never had fries that look and taste as bad as these ones were. I would rather have McDs fries even though I never step foot in that place. When I kindly told our server that the fries were over done she rolled her eyes and gave me  a lot of attitude. She even said \"well I eat them and I think they are great.\" Ugh, really? Good for you for having great taste. Both her and the manager were unpleasant. I would never come back. I also had to ask them to not charge me for the fries that I did not eat."}
{"text":"This review is for one thing and one thing only.  Overpricing gone wild.  I've been to L'espresso Bar Mercurio dozens of time, since I work near by.  Had many a business lunch/coffee here.  I've noticed the decline in their menu (along with the rise in their prices) over the last couple of years and I always thought it was a bearable shame.   But the other day I was there (for another business meeting) and decided to opt out of the overpriced $4 coffee that I usually get.  I decided to go for a smoothie instead.  I ordered one with tropical in the title made of pineapple, orange and banana.  Sounded good.  The barista took a blender and added two chunks of pineapple (each about the size of an ipod shuffle), about 1/4 of a banana and maybe 1/3 of a cup of tropicana orange juice.  She blended it up and poured it into a small-ish wine glass.  It filled it about 2/3 of the way up.  With tax and tip?  $7.50.  Now I'm not fussy about paying a little extra for the pleasure of someone else making yummy things for me, but this felt outrageous.  L'espresso, have you no shame?  How can you exploit your loyal customers so?  Time to find another spot for my meetings, me thinks."}
{"text":"Great place for a brunch or a coffee! So far I'd say one of the best coffee places in town - take it from a coffee aficionado and a world traveller! Good atmosphere, gets very busy at times, as UofT students and profs frequent this place."}
{"text":"When I come here, it's usually for lunch. It gets crowded pretty fast during the week day. While I know some people who swear by their coffee, I'm just OK with it.   You can get seated first, however, then you have to get up again to order and pay for your order yourself at the counter. The food and drinks will be brought over to you. There's an automatic 12% service charge even before anything is served which I doubt really appreciate. What if the food was awful or if we didn't get service? There wouldn't be any incentive to perform well as we would have already paid. Students get 20% off.  The lunch specials are mostly sandwiches which are very tasty and are usually served alongside olives and peppers. The last time I went I had a grilled chicken sandwich which was quite nice."}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm puzzled as to why the majority of reviews have been so mediocre. Although please note, I only enjoyed a quick latte and small pastry there with my husband on a Saturday afternoon.  The espresso was decent and the selection of vegan and gluten free baked goods was impressive. The friendliness of the staff left a little to be desired, but not a big deal.   It was nice to sit at a marble top table for two in front of the window and people watch whole drinking out of real mugs. A nice change of pace from the typical Starbucks experience."}
{"text":"*croissant update: a fair croissant baked in-house (always a necessity when ordering a croissant).  nice flakey layers but truly lacks that buttery taste I love in a croissant."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey and interesting ordering layout / system but the espresso is splendid and the desserts gluten-free. Depends on what you're looking for. If you're going for a date, then this is the perfect place to meet up. If you're just walking by with a good friend, I'd recommend Starbucks instead. The environment is a little too stiff for long chats. Ordering take out is probably the best option."}
{"text":"Mercurio is a staple for many UofT students, mostly because the coffee is infinitely better than Second Cup and Starbucks, and costs about the same. The place itself is pretty good as a study or light conversation spot - unlike other cafes, it doesn't play loud music and definitely understands who its clientele are.  Downsides? Outside of the coffee, everything on the menu is definitely pricy. The food is good, though the prices just don't match. Further, the service is hit & miss - good people work there, and they're occassionally nice, but they have a sense of arrogance and superiority which kills the experience. Further, they can be really pushy, and they don't seem to understand that their cafe is one of the busiest in the UofT area.  They recently jacked up the price for having a coffee in the cafe - a medium ordinarily goes for about $1.80, and in house it's now $2.35. I asked why, and they said it's a service charge - which doesn't fit because you have to pick up the coffee from the counter yourself. Like I said, arrogant."}
{"text":"My husband and I like having brunch here and have been a few times.  The food is good and I like how they have different options of milk, including almond.  Service is generally good, but one time, I asked for no potatoes (don't really like them) with my order (artichoke frittata).  The server, however, gave me attitude about it (as in she looked at me funny, and then asked me what I wanted instead).  The conversation went a bit like this:  Me: If it's a bit difficult for the kitchen, they can just leave it out Server: But it's included with the meal - what would you like in place of it? (for the second time, if I recall correctly) Me: (had to come up with something quickly) Perhaps a little bit more salad? Server: I'll have to check with the kitchen  Seriously, just leave it out and don't bother checking if it's THAT HARD!  :S  I'm sticking with potatoless dishes now."}
{"text":"My first negative revue. I used to come here at least once a week and used to enjoy it very much. The staff is always pleasant and the food used to be of good quality.  I assume there was a managerial change or a different chef because the quality of their food has drastically decreased.  I recently got a brunch salad to go and there was only 1 egg (usually 2), the toast advertised as toasted wasn't and there was a liquide residue at the bottom of my dish (didn't drain the poached eggs?).   Convenient location and kind staff, but they should really do something about their food (either decrease the price to match the quality or increase the quality to match the price)"}
{"text":"My former UofT boss and I had coffee and desserts here one beautiful and hot September afternoon.  It's been forever since I came here after graduating UofT, but it was one of my favourite places to have coffee and breakfast before work.   This place is beautiful and full of class, just like how I remembered it.  The servers are friendly, professional and knowledgable -just like how any servers should be.  They have a huge variety of quality desserts, none of them are vegan friendly, but they do have alot of gluten free options. They also sport a diverse drinks menu, that offers alternatives to soy milk and  regular milk for coffees beverages.  I remembered their drip coffee was amazing back as an undergrad and as an employee, so trusting it's still the same, and since it was so hot that day, I ordered a non-sweet latte with almond milk. It was AMAZING the best latte I'd ever had in my life (thus far).   Time is the true test of a business. L'espresso was still as good as I remembered, if not better as I'm older now with a greater appreciation for quality and elegance.  Honestly, as an undergrad who worked for UofT, I only came here for coffee and breakfast cos it was convienent.  It's right outside St. George Station, and on the way to campus, what more could anyone want?  Well actually, I can't say I didn't appreciate quality when I was younger, (maybe I'm just more aware of it now), cos I remember hating cheap coffee like Tim Hortons and Coffeetime. Ick!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I had one of the worst experiences at this restaurant. I must say that this is certainly not my first time here but it will be my last. The setup and organization of this place is an absolute mess!  We were first seated at our table, however we were not told that they changed their order system and that we had to line up to order our meal. Why seat us if we haven't ordered yet? The waitress was very rude and said: \"I thought you've been here before\". After we ordered, we sat down and our order was served to the wrong table. Fine, no big deal. The only thing that made it weird was that as when were waiting on my order to make its way over, the waiter came up to us and said: \"would you like me to pack that to go for you\". My friend hasn't even touched her food (and it was obvious) and we're already being asked to leave indirectly. Lol We politely mentioned that we were waiting on our second order and haven't started eating yet, but we will let him know if we wanted our meals to go.   So finally my fish and chips arrived with my zucchini fries. The food was good! A little salty, but palatable. There's just one problem... How is anyone supposed to eat fish from a metal basket. Yes. That's right, the fish was served on top of the zucchini fries in a metal frying basket with a handle. How is anyone supposed to cut the fish? So I politely asked for a small plate. The waiter was short and curt with me and said that that's how it's supposed to be eaten. I still asked for a plate as there was no way anyone could cut a piece of fish from a mental basket. When my plate arrived, the waiter brought another set of cutlery, which I just set off to the side as I wasn't going to use it. A quarter of the way into our meal, one of the owners (I believe she is the owners wife), reaches onto my table from behind me without excusing herself to grab the unused cutlery. *facepalm*  It seems like the staff here are more concerned with getting you in and out, as opposed to you really enjoying yourself or your meal. It's a tight space, so I didn't appreciate the woman coming into my space from behind me and grabbing at the cutlery and I certainly didn't appreciate being asked to pack our meals before that even made it out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I like this place.  It is a bit nicer, has some tasty options and has a quiet patio for warm summer days.   I particularly like the porridge, of all things, and the eggs Benedict made with smoked salmon.  They also make lovely croissant and nutella croissant.  This restaurant may not be able to beat out Bonjour Brioche for the best French pastry and bread in the city, but it is lovely and based on where I live, far more convenient to get to."}
{"text":"I've been coming here frequently as of late, to meet photographers and other vendors for wedding.   It's great because it's walking distance from my place, easy to find, it's got Free Wifi, and great selection of teas, pastries and snacks.   Tea's are a bit expensive, but they are quality and comes in a cast iron pot, refillable with hot water. They have an extensive bunch of pastries and gluten free / vegan sweetness.   We usually sit on the west end, because it's a small nook that's private-ish. They don't seem to turn on the lights in this area, unless requested and it gets really dark. We asked them to turn them on, and only the pot lights came on.   They close at 8pm (early!) and they turned on all the lights today to kick us out, but it was great lighting!  I think if they opened later, they would get more folks in there who want to work, and finding starbucks too cramped."}
{"text":"Adjacent to the Bata Shoe Museum, this was the perfect spot to wait out the sad mid-week drizzle. The café was warm and welcoming without feeling too stuffy. The hostess was quick to show us to our seats and explain that orders are placed at the bar and then later brought to your table.   The atmosphere was understated and chic. Some patrons dined solo while others murmured away on the latest presidential debates.   The lunch menu is simple and broken down into four parts: panini, salads, drinks and sweet crepes. The dishes themselves were simple and fresh, without excessive seasoning to clutter and confuse the tastebuds. And as name suggests, the coffee is wonderful.  Overall, a lovely place to wile away the hours with a friend or a book."}
{"text":"This great Italian espresso bar is right on my way to school, so any time I feel like a splurge I'll skip the Starbucks and stop by this wonderful place. The espresso here is delicious, if you like coffee you will not be disappointed. It's a bit on the pricey end however ~ (3.75 for a double Americano + tip). The pastries are also quite something, the almond Biscotti is the perfect complement to that morning coffee.  Definitely check this place out if you're around Bloor and St. George."}
{"text":"Delicious oatmeal, and nice marble topped cafe tables in a wifi-enabled coffee and sandwich shop that is unhurried. An excellent spot for breakfast if you are on Bloor street."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's a little bit of New York in Toronto.  Friendly staff and management, tasty and reasonably priced food.  And Mama makes the best pastries!"}
{"text":"I like he fact that it's an espresso bar. They have everything such as latte , Americans, mocha , mochaccinno, etc. plus they don't have granulated white sugar. Instead they have honey and brown sugar."}
{"text":"Decent lunch spot.  It's a classy joint that's located on the ground floor of a dorm and across from the Bata Shoe Museum.  They have curtains sectioning off bits of space and it's really open (floor to ceiling windows!) in a functional/industrial sort of way while still maintaining some elegance.  The food is pretty good - mmm paninis - but they're a little expensive for the area.    When you enter, take a order sheet and check off what you want, then bring it to the bar.  They'll have you pay and give you a number that you can put on a table, and will bring you the food when it's ready.  So quasi-table service."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe near uoft campus! They have such a nice seating area however it can get really busy at certain times.  Great location for uoft students looking for a nice cafe near campus to study, have a coffee, or a nice lunch.  I absolutely loved their coffee. I just had a latte but it wasn't too strong and was prepared to my liking. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I came across this place as I was heading into class. It was the closest coffee place to my class. However, I have mixed feelings about this place. The coffee that I ordered was a drip coffee and I have to say I really enjoyed it it was a nice medium dark blend. I also ordered a prosciutto sandwich. The sandwich was good but it was very pricey in my opinion. The service of this place, was okay. I only ordered a coffee and a sandwich and my total bill I believe to be on them more pricey side compare to other coffee places that I've been to. The service I received at the counter was only satisfactory. In fact, I thought the lady that was serving me cut them was giving me attitude for asking simple questions like what drip coffee they have because I generally like a dark brew versus a medium brew. I would come back but probably only for coffee because it's so close to my class. I might consider trying other items on their menu but not anytime soon. I am really giving this place a 3 star vs a 2 star is really because of the brew coffee."}
{"text":"great atmosphere, lots of seating. great teas and coffee, pretty solid food (20% off for students), huge dessert assortment (the donut is very good). great place to do work, can be loud and busy, but the music is good and it makes you feel a little fancy. pricy but not so much you don't feel comfortable."}
{"text":"There aren't many nice non-franchised/chain coffee shops on this particular stretch of Bloor Street. This is a real gem! They have a great patio and the interior of the café is decorated with personality (especially the old car they have in there), though it doesn't overwhelm you. I love that there are huge windows and natural light is a key part of the café ambiance.   The salads and sandwiches here are on the lighter side and I generally prefer coming here for coffee and snacks. I would recommend trying the latte here for a genuine latte experience. The pecan tart is delicious and I would safely say that the rest of the desserts offered would be just as tantalizing to the senses!  Great place for a chat with a friend or for a few hours of working!"}
{"text":"Pricy little lunch joint on the periphery of the U of T campus, but still close and accessible to a busy part of Bloor. Crowd is a mix of faculty, students, neighborhood lookyloos and the occasional stroller-burdened parent wandering in from the nearby museum.  Mercurio has decent specials and offer a 20% discount with a student ID, but it's still a bit spendy for the typical student budget. I usually take my nosh to go, but the times that I have eaten there, the service has been stiff and slightly harried, but still good. As for the food... well, it's better than most on campus options, and the pastries are delicious and decadent. It's not the greatest, but it's good for a treat. With that said, it's a good place to people watch, or perhaps do a little networking with your favorite prof over coffee and croissant."}
{"text":"One of the few options for something other than hot dog vendors or subway in the area.  Being a graduate student on the U of T campus there isn't much to eat within a short walk and so as winter gets closer and the fall breeze becomes sharper this is within the tolerable radius.  The inside is nice and modern but without any warmth whatsoever.  The changing leaves on the trees outside and bikers by make for a quaint view but the inside is packed and bare feeling.    The menu is indeed expensive but so much more so for substitutions and the resulting portions are not enough.  I've never gone home and not eaten another later lunch afterwards and I order burgers.   That said, the ingredients appear to be higher quality and there are gluten-free options so I'm thankful for that but they just aren't that well done.  It's ok but this is survival through lack of competition."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Pros: - Nice decor. The vintage car makes the cafe stand out. - Delicious food and desserts. - I like the fact that the cafe is very accommodating and generous towards the UofT community- 20% discounts for students and you can also reserve the cafe for networking sessions.   Cons: - Pricey."}
{"text":"Gave us shelter from the rain. The coffee was nothing special, but good. Really elegant decor and cups. Seems to be a popular spot for tourists and students so it's rather loud. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a weekday and it was really busy. There was a sign that says please wait to be seated but really you just find a table and order at the counter. Find a table fist cos they ask you for your table number when you order at the counter (How was I suppose to know?) The cashier had a bit of attitude. There were servers walking around bringing out the food who checked up on the table next to us if everything was ok then gave them hot sauce upon request, but they don't go around to all the tables--we could've used some ketchup but decided to live without it. Food was pricey and it was just A-ok... literally not-bad."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. Visited at 7:30 Monday morning, just as they were opening. We were warmly greeted and the smells of the very freshly baked muffins and croissants drew us in further.  It's pretty reasonably priced. They have daily coffee and a (croque madame, monsieur...) specials which looked really tempting, but we stuck with lattes, teas, croissants to go.   Really nice staff, helpful, sweet. Yummy lattes and croissants. I would love to go back for sit-down breakfast, especially at 7:30am before it gets too crowded. Nice spot. And the side patio looks lovely."}
{"text":"One of the best places for cappuccino in Toronto. Friendly service, nice atmosphere, great lunch menu and pastries."}
{"text":"Great place. Love the environment. My favourite place for brunch because the food is delicious and close to school!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and pastries, and simply awesome bistro-style food. I had a chicken panino the last time I visited Bar Mercurio (I've visited a few times), and the panino was one of the best I've ever had - two large pieces of chicken parmigiana on a fresh baked baguette-style bun topped with fresh greens, and sweet potato chips on the side. The espresso based drinks can be somewhat pricey, though they are always made with care. A great place for lunch, or to sit and read with a coffee, especially outside on the beautiful patio!"}
{"text":"Pretentious menu and mediocre/unfilling food. Service is unfriendly. So crappy I went somewhere for a second lunch."}
{"text":"Nearly two years have passed since my first visit, so an update seems warranted. Early February mornings in Toronto can be cold and windy. A warm and inviting cafe like this one that opens at 7:30 am is welcome, indeed. If it serves excellent coffee alongside satisfyingly simple breakfast fare, then it's even better. And if it is also stylish inside with generous seating areas, huge glass windows, and comfortable tables, then you know you've found a pretty appealing place. L'eBM was just as good this time around as it was two years earlier. It almost made me feel like a local to be returning after such an extended absence only to find things strikingly similar to how I had once remembered them.  But maybe my breakfast needs are minimal. I'm not looking for lumberjack portions or flowing rivers of syrup. I don't need endless cups of coffee or perky servers checking up on me every five minutes. I can't eat a half dozen eggs scrambled, flipped, or fried in one sitting. I'll manage without a basket of buttered biscuits or freshly baked bread. And I don't mind a place free from the sounds of cell phones, rustling newspapers, falling forks, and raucous laughter. I can get my engines running without all the fuss.  A hot cup of coffee, a small bite to eat, and a quiet hour or so to read, relax, and watch the snow fall silently on the sidewalk just outside the window: that's all I really needed from L'eBM. I ordered at the counter, paid my bill, set my coat, hat, and gloves on an empty chair, and finished my breakfast without a single disruption. Doesn't sound like much, does it? But it's not easy to find. Here, they've delivered each and every time. Nice to know that some things retain their charms and consistencies, even after a few years have passed. It's good to be able to depend on that."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe, filled with all things delicious.   The entrance is decorated with a life size car, and under the hood is a variety of the cafes products so you can purchase things to take away with you if necessary.   There's no table service here - you decide what you want and go order at the service bar.  The pastries, chocolates and other treats are displayed in a large glass fronted cabinet, allowing you to see firsthand what's on offer. There is also a vast meal and drinks menu. My friend and I had only popped in for a drink and sweet treat. I ordered a green tea and blueberry smoothie and their cup of chocolate mousse.  The chocolate mousse was smooth and delicoous, so much so that it melted in my mouth, I hoped it would never end.  If you're in need of a sugar fix, this is the perfect place to try :)"}
{"text":"You should come here for the coffee and *only* for the coffee. The coffee here is expensive, but the best within walking distance. I get a cup here almost every day, and love the atmosphere, the staff, and the flavour.  All food and pastries, however, are disappointing and ridiculously overpriced -- do not come here to eat. They used to have a spectacular baker, but a couple of months ago they switched to someone who makes mediocre, dry, over-sweetened pastries. Sometimes they're burned, sometimes they're stale. They make a mistake on my food order every other time, and this week I got a chicken club sandwich with rotten avocado and a terrible cut of chicken. I'm tired of returning mistakes (fries instead of salad) or food with rotten ingredients and getting apologetic looks from their servers and angry stares from their kitchen staff. I threw it out and made a commitment to stop ordering food here."}
{"text":"A cafe with a nice little red car inside. Isn't that cute?The place is large yet appears small. They serve everything - from coffee to liquor to pastries to meals. I have been here twice - once for a corporate social after a Rotman event and the other for a catch up with my colleagues. Both times, I have loved it. The staff is friendly and they have lot of options - especially for tea and coffee. I was hungry and I could get some nice food too. In a world dominated by the Strarbucks and other fancy restaurants, something like this always pleases me. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Limited menu. Meals came at all different times in a group of 4. Food was fair, but a bit bland and nothing overly impressive for a $17 sandwich. Yukon potatoes were carbs that were not worth the calories. Staff were not unpleasant."}
{"text":"Great Service!  Great Pastry!  The Butter Tart was delish."}
{"text":"Good coffee, great tea selection, love the Italian donuts when they are fresh,  but please get a water filter! The taste of chlorine does not compliment any meal."}
{"text":"The shine has worn off this place since I wrote my first review a few years ago.  They changed up the menu and got rid of several excellent dishes.  Even the French press coffee I loved so much is now gone!  This isn't just nostalgia -- the quality seems to have gone down a notch or two too."}
{"text":"This place suffers from having a great location. With its location, where it caters to busy students, professors, and business people seeking to meet colleagues, it gets away with...  1. Having a very confusing system where you don't always know if you are allowed to order at your table or must order at the bar. In fact, getting a seat is sometimes an ordeal in itself. 2. Having a chaotic customer service process for ordering at the counter. You don't know where to wait and are treated with indifference. 3. Offering a decent product, yet without value. Prices do not match portion sizes. 4. Having average-at-best service at the tables."}
{"text":"This place was really awesome when it first opened a few years ago.  They had a delicious brunch menu, and very solid cafe beverages.   Unfortunately, the menu has been dumbed down significantly. The brunch is very \"bare bones\". The price is a bit high.  The coffee is damn good, but you're paying a significant premium for the privilege. (If you can get a good student discount, then hit it.)   On the plus side, this place has a good atmosphere, and the servers are friendly in my experience."}
{"text":"Quick and easy lunch spot close to U of T campus. The food is tasty and interesting, and the service is efficient."}
{"text":"After having breakfast at Over Easy, just east of L'Espresso Bar Mercurio, I really wished I would have gone to L'Espresso for breakfast. It's so much better.  L'Espresso must have heard the complaints about service (if they were true) because the service was amazing. I was sitting solo on the patio and there were 3-4 waitresses always around asking me if everything was good and if I need something. You know that great kind of service where if you put your head down nobody bothers you but as soon as you lift your head to ask for something, someone is right there.  The patio is one of the nicest street level patios along Bloor near Varsity Stadium. And the interior is large with lots of window light and a bistro feel with marble tables and a large bar at the front.  I had the Frittata special which was perfect along with the peach arugula salad. The food came out very hot and was just the right size. And yes, the cappuccino is definitely top shelf however the true test of a great restaurant involve the little things, like bringing a side of honey in a small metal cup instead of Kraft packets. Yes I am big on those small details since they reveal a lot about how well restaurants cater to their guests."}
{"text":"I don't fully understand the cookies in a car inside the entrance...though I guess it makes for an interesting conversation piece while waiting to get seated. Overall though,  I like this place!   For a cafe, I'd say the food selection is quite nice. It's not an overly large number of items to choose from, but at the same time, all the items on their menu looked interesting to me. Normally it leads to a paradox of choice, but i happened to have a bunch of work related breakfast and lunch meetings here over the course of two weeks... Seven times to be exact. So i was able to try a lot that was on their menu. I really liked their zuchini fries. Yum! I also really enjoyed their fish and chips for lunch, and French toast for breakfast. Overall I would have to say that foodwise, everything i had was good. Service was friendly. One thing i didn't like as much was the chocolate mousse. It was a little too sweet. If the sweetness was toned down a little, it would have been very good.  It is a busy joint, so keep that in mind. I decided to come for coffee here during brunch on the weekend. They said sorry, they were saving tables for people who wanted brunch, but i could get my latte to go. Understandable, as they were packed that day already."}
{"text":"really bad customer service. some friends and i went for coffee and decided to stay for lunch, which we alerted the server about.  waiting for two friends to arrive, we put in a salad order, and five minutes after a different server told us they needed our table for a reservation! they were so eager to kick us out we just decided to take our lunch party elsewhere.  they place has good coffee, but what a mess!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for a quick coffee and snack when I was wandering around the area.  I had excellent service from the woman at the counter, but the baristas were a little bit distracted doing some girl watching. I watched for a while as my Americano cooled on the back counter, until the counter lady noticed and brought it up to me. It was amusing in an eye-rolly sort of way, she seemed to share in my exasperated amusement.  They do make a nice Americano."}
{"text":"Super cute location at the bottom of the Woodsworth residence in U of T. They have a super french vibe, with the little Fiat parked inside for show and French accordion music playing in the background.   Too bad they're insanely overpriced. 5 dollars for one square inch of pasty? No thanks."}
{"text":"Congratulations to this place for turning it around... great wait staff, and consistently good coffee. *Now* I don't mind spending a dollar more for my coffee... on occasion."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the staff basically demands that you tell her why you have entered the store...was not impressed with the staff overall, they were rude, cold and impersonal, the girl serving me didn't even offer me my receipt and after you order they bring you your food and drink...but don't tell you this, so you stand around the counter like a loser while the staff ignore you until you slowly walk away, very confused.  I was actually really excited to finally try L'espresso and even more so that I brought my tea swigging little sister with me, whom never gets to come Toronto with me. However, I ended up just feeling bad that I took her to the land of over-priced. We shared a piece of Tiramisu and each got some tea; I had the white rose and she the green oolong. These three items came to $20.00, I was a little shocked but I though that everything was going to be over the top amazing, since they charge through the roof for their products. When they brought us our tea and cake, I was in love with the presentation of the tea; we both got mini-tea pots on bamboo trays, so adorable. My tea was really light and summery, I really enjoyed it and my sister said hers was good as well. I do feel slighted that each tea was close to five dollars and there was maybe a cup of tea in each pot. The tiramisu was creamy and light as well but it wasn't anything special, definitely not worth the seven dollars I paid for it.  I am pretty disappointed with my experience here but I have been reading other reviews and perhaps I should just stick to the coffee and espresso drinks at L'espresso. I don't know if there will be a next time, it will have to be someone else's suggestion because I won't be coming back by choice."}
{"text":"Good for coffee and a nice place to just sit and do your work.  To dine comfortably and have a nice meal?  Not so much.   Had the kale salad and it was nothing special for $13.  Just some sprinkled parmesan, ranch dressing, and dried prosciutto - which in my opinion, these three ingredients DO not marry well together with the kale.   Tasted horrible and I just felt the salad is probably at most worth $7 or less based on the ingredients they give you.  And it didn't taste like it was the freshest either.  The two pieces of baguette they give you on the side was stale.  Service was subpar and I don't think should warrant the 12.5% tip they add to your bill.   It was weird that the cashier said, we charge a 12.5% gratuity but we don't bring the drinks to your table, we'll bring the food.  Huh?  I just paid for service.  hello?  Besides, the place was less than 50% capacity.   They WERE NOT that busy.  So the least they can do was to give better service and bring the drinks over.     Together with two salads and two drinks came up to almost $40.  So NOT worth it. I think I can find better options around the area."}
{"text":"I would give L'Espresso Bar Mercurio a 3.5/5. We came on a day where they said their kitchen was closed due to the holidays. It seemed like a lot of the customers were disappointed so I probably didn't get the full Bar Mercurio experience.   My friend and I seated ourselves. It was pretty busy for a weekday morning. Because their kitchen was closed we decided to grab a sandwich. I had asked the lady to remove the bacon before grilling my sandwich and she said she couldn't because she didn't have gloves. She also couldn't help us cut our sandwiches. I remember Starbucks couldn't cut sandwiches due to their food license but Bar Mercurio has a full kitchen. I found it hard to believe she couldn't do it for me.   Other than that, the sandwiches were good. I had the Chicken BLT panini which had a kick due to the chipotle mayo. The caprese panini was also good according to my friend. They brush olive oil and some spices on the flat bread so I enjoyed the sandwich.   I would give this place another shot when their kitchen is open but the prices are a bit up there. I feel you can find better for lower prices."}
{"text":"Pretty good choice if you're on campus and looking for something other than Starbucks, Tim Hortons or Second Cup. Coffee is solid and the mini biscottis are quite tasty. Overall nothing to write home about, but I definitely will be returning for a quick study pick-me-up."}
{"text":"Wonderful oatmeal!   I didn't have a big appetite for breakfast, so ordered a bowl of oatmeal.  It was fantastic - it had milk over the top, but was creamy, and filled with seeds and pecans and maybe a bit of coconut (?), every so slightly sweetened."}
{"text":"- frappucino was amazing - matcha latte was meh - food very good (stuffed mushrooms) - very nice decor"}
{"text":"They grill your sandwich when you ask them not to, they make your coffee with lactose milk when you ask for lactose-free, it's a little overpriced, there's a weird semi-disorganized coordination between the cafe side and the restaurant (you wouldn't order something from both sides, if you knew what was good for you), and the porchetta is sometimes dry, so why come here? The coffee is delicious (and can be made with lactose-free milk - not such a common thing), the croissants are good and made in house, the smoked salmon benny is solid and when the porchetta is good, it's good. Also, there's not a lot of this kind of thing done well in the neighbourhood.  Too loud to work when it's busy. Conversations get loud and there's a hum like you're in a shopping mall."}
{"text":"Sometimes they have things on the menu that they don't actually have in stock for months which is annoying. Often they have student specials which is awesome. Their sandwiches are somewhat overpriced for what you get, as are their breakfasts, and I would not recommend the soggy croissant french toast or the donuts though they seem popular (I find them dry). From a student perspective, I think this place is just more convenient than anything else. However, when I am in the area, I always always make time for one of their excellent lattes and a chocolate croissant that's pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I don't care how rushed you are with making coffee, this americano is still costing me 3.50 and it is very, very bad.   It is bitter. The espresso goes in after the water - NOT BEFORE.  I don't know why everyone thinks this place is great. The coffee in my hand is battery acid!"}
{"text":"I left this place feeling very grumpy. So like most miserable people, I'm going to write a review.  From the outside, this place looks kind of intriguing, though I've walked by it for 7 years without ever going in. Today I went inside. First of all, L'espresso Bar Mercurio is very unattractive inside...but as the saying goes, don't judge a restaurant by its inside. Other than being overpriced, getting my order wrong and being rude, the coffee was surprisingly not good at all. I drank my pale brown water and spilt a bit on my shirt. I was super annoyed to say the least. Then, I got a parking ticket! But that's unrelated to this, and I will have to complain elsewhere about that.  Anyways,   Have a nice day everyone.  I do not recommend L'espresso Bar Mercurio."}
{"text":"I went here twice, once for lunch and once for a red eye and pastry to go.  I'll come back again and again and again.  Even if just for my afternoon coffee.  The lunch was excellent and I'll come here for lunch on a regular basis I expect.  And from what I saw I can hang in there for a couple of hours doing work on my laptop...it that's the case then I'll be a daily regular here.  If they had live classical music then it'd be close to perfect.  But then there's the wait and the noise and the service to consider.  None of those things are terrible but all together they cost this place one star.  Perhaps after I get more familiar with this place I'll have to adjust my rating (up or down), but it's a solid place for me."}
{"text":"A beautiful cafe that's bright and generally bustling with business professionals, students, and tourists. Popped in here prior to a stop at the ROM and exploring downtown.   Had tea and it came in a cast iron pot and Japanese style cup on a bamboo serving plate. Had a lemon macaroon which was dense and mealy, sadly."}
{"text":"While very busy, this place is a very enjoyable cafe to eat in.   The food is quickly served, the service is friendly and the menu has a great selection. My first visit, I was able to enjoy a crab BLT on a foccacia bread. While, as I find with many fancier sandwiches) it's messy, the flavour is fresh and tasty. So if you're ever having a business lunch, make sure to use a knife to cut the sandwich.  This is an ideal place to have quick lunch or meet up with a friend. However it should be warned that this place does not take reservations and is very busy. You should head to their other restaurant if you would like to assure yourself a place to sit. While I find many loud restaurants a bit overwhelming, I was still able to hold a conversation in this one, so don't let the business overwhelm you."}
{"text":"To be honest I don't remember what I ate here. It was a while back. I know it was a panini. I think a roasted veggie but all I can remember was how unimpressed I was with it. That being said, the dinning area is fresh, clean, open. The ordering process is do it yourself with little menus at your table to check off and take your  ticket to the counter to pay and order.  What did stand out the most for me was the delicious macchiato I had. I can't wait to go back and have it again."}
{"text":"A tad expensive for a coffee shop but it's definitely got a nicer atmosphere than most. Croissants are mediocre but tiramisu, chocolate macaroon and shortbread are delicious. Lattes (hot and iced) are good. The caprese salad with cheap bocconcini left lots to be desired, but the sandwich special was quite good. I've been here a few times and service varies... Some people are so friendly and make you feel like you're the most important customer in the store, and others are so snappy that you get scared to ask for a napkin. A coffee shop that offers sweet potato fries with chipotle aioli? Swoon! Other than the occasional not-so-friendly counter associate, overall, service is great. Food, coffee and exciting dessert counter will keep me coming back. I like this place and when I'm hungry or want a coffee and I'm in the area, this is the spot."}
{"text":"I was walking through the university campus and wanted lunch and warmth so I decided to step in this place. It was almost 2pm so the place wasn't as busy. I chose a table by the window, ordered a sandwich, and read my book while I waited. I had a prosciutto, arugula, and cheese sandwich and it was delicious. The coffee and sweets were really good too!"}
{"text":"Arugula beet salad was not horrible, but not worth 11 dollars. Greens had soaked in dressing too long, almost at wilt stage. Beets should have been sliced smaller.  Ginger carrot juice was good though, light and refreshing."}
{"text":"You get delicious coffee and they don't charge any extra for their \"you're a shitty dirt bag son of a bitch\" attitude!  Customer service sucks serious rocks, but the coffee is done correct.  So much so, I actually went back twice while I was in town for work for more coffee - and complimentary attitude!  I'd even go back again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here on Tuesday morning before a seminar. You order at the counter and then pick up your own drinks but they bring your food to your table. Efficient, and you pay up front so there's no wait at the end. Cool, inviting coffeehouse interior, friendly, fairly quick service. Coffee is excellent! They make delicious custom smoothies--you choose your own ingredients from a decent size list(kale, ginger, banana, etc). The food is really good, hot and good size portion. The egg breakfast with bacon and toast and potatoes came out perfect, and they even substituted a salad for the potatoes on one of our orders. The French toast was the only disappointment--they put cold pineapple slices on the hot toast, which caused it to be soggy, although it had good flavor. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The convenient location, close to U of T and the St. George subway station, is just about the only thing this cafe has to recommend it. Counter service is snooty and inconsistent, seating is uncomfortable and hard to come by, and the whole place is large, crowded, loud, and impersonal. I've tended to get tea rather than coffee here, and every time it has been weak, the water lukewarm, and the quantity small for the price. I only go here if I must, for an occasional work meeting. Otherwise, avoid."}
{"text":"L'espresso, in my opinion, is one of the truly underrated spots in this are of the city. There are so many reasons for me to like this place that I would rather just list them in bullet points (this is after all a cafe on campus):  food: -Impressively food allergy and vegetarian conscious menu.  -The soup is consistently good.  -Ribeye burger is my current favourite burger in the city (add shoestring fries + chipotle mayo) -Overall the best place for lunch on campus.  coffee/ tea:  -Standard coffee, cappuccino etc. are quite good.  -Impressive tea list and even more impressive serving set for such a spot. -Fine array of sweets to accompany the tea/coffee.   staff etc.: -Very quick turnaround time.  -Usually polite, courteous, and accommodating. -Patrons are not rushed. -20% student discount!"}
{"text":"Great menu, servers are terrible. Rude, not friendly - enough to make you not want to come back, which is a shame because this could be a favorite spot for me as someone who lives in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I strongly recommend the power booster smoothie! Even though it's ridiculously expensive, it's the best tasting thing on a warm summer day.   This place is a combination of a restaurant, coffee shop and bar with mellow music, fancy dressed bartenders and, lots of space and plenty of delicious food. The Italian Proscuitto was so good. The bread was nice and warm and the Mozzarella cheese added a nice texture and flavour to the sandwhich. You can either sit outside in the patio, which is gorgeous or sit indoors, which is equally well decorates and comfortable. I've found myself a great study space!"}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a few times when I was running from work to school and needed something to keep me going. This place is super convenient for U of T students on the go.  Although my visits here are never very long, my experiences have been pretty good. Because of its prime location, it can get really busy really fast at certain times of the day, so sometimes you can spend a while waiting in line, or there won't be any room to sit because of all the students working on their class work.  The menu is quite extensive, they have a ton of different things to choose from- coffee, tea, cocktails, and food. I've only had tea and some pastries when I was here and I have no complaints about that. The baristas seem to know what they're doing and they're good at that. Mad respect for pouring as many drinks as they do during the rush times.  My only downside is that I can never find anywhere to sit because it's so busy all the time. I would recommend it though if you're a person on the go!"}
{"text":"Honestly disappointing coffee and the service just isn't that great either. It's not bad but after a couple tries I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I think this place is great. I think it would be better if it had table service and it abandoned the confusing seating procedure."}
{"text":"Had a brunch date today and I wish we had gone elsewhere. The service was terrible- neglectful waiters and slow delivery of food and bill. Noticed a few wrong orders and our bill had to be corrected as well.   Cannot recommend l'Espresso Panino. The menu said scrambled egg but it was microwaved/omelet like texture. Lots of spinach (yay), not enough aged cheddar (boo!). The eggs rested on a cranberry scone that was tasty but all these flavours did not marry well. Side of bacon saved the day.   I RECOMMEND-   the salmon kale salad. Friend had it and it looked basic but light and refreshing, perfect for a hot day. She rather enjoyed it   EXTRA TIP- Latte was standard, OJ was good, pass on the mimosa"}
{"text":"These guys are great! Delicious and healthy food, with vegan and gluten free options to  choose from. I'll always pay a little more for health and quality- but not all students would and demand larger portion sizes wherever they go. It's an elegant cafe, although they do need to redo their floors. They give discounts to students, which comes in handy over time. The servers are always so pleasant, and are definitely kept busy. Their system of seating isn't confusing- I don't know what others are referring too. You just wait at the sign until someone comes to get you (less than 1 minute) or you go straight up and order at the cash for takeout. Pretty simple to me."}
{"text":"Coffee is bitter, Caesar salad had wilted romaine lettuce, panini are boring and tasteless, and prices are far too high. Their eating area is entirely self-serve (I literally poured my own water), and yet they include a gratuity automatically when you pay at the counter. Say what? Nobody served me. What a joke this place is.   Stay away unless you enjoy being ripped off."}
{"text":"Great coffee, yummy desserts, rushed service. Every time. I've been here over a 100 times and the service is definitely always rushed. The best time to go is before lunch or after lunch. Patio in summer is a charming escape. Did I say the service is always rushed?   It's unfortunate because this place has the potential to be a 5 if only they simply let their customers who have already paid for their meal enjoy their meal and time together.  Also, if you're a student, don't forget to flash your card. The discount is worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to lunch and to grab an early dinner. The food is always fresh, healthy and tasty. The lattes and other coffee are true Italy. The owners and the servers really care."}
{"text":"Crab BLT sandwich is one of the best I've had in my life and I don't even like sandwiches. I also got the rose white tea and it's so good. 20% discount for students!! It's pretty classy/funky inside with tons of food, dessert, coffee, tea, alcohol selection with classy music. First time here and definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, excellent pastries, and they recently added these delicious chia bowls for breakfast. The forced table service in the weekend (as opposed to ordering at counter on weekdays) is slow even if place is empty."}
{"text":"This place has some good tea and ok food.  Even with a student discount, though, it is very expensive.  The servers here have a tiny bit of attitude.  If it weren't so convenient to where I live and school, I wouldn't eat here at all.  I can't recommend this place to anybody to go out of their way to give it a try.  However, if in the area it might be worth a shot."}
