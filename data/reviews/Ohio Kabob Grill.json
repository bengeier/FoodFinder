{"text":"Authentic, delicious. Owner is fantastic and pours his heart into his cooking. I'm a frequent customer and bring friends here when I can."}
{"text":"Really good! I had the spicy chicken and lamb kabobs. They were awesome!! Service was great, and very informative. I learned a lot about the food. I would definitely recommend this place. Looking forward to my next order!!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious food. Very friendly service. We tried the gyro and the lamb shish kabob. The lamb was so flavorful and perfectly grilled. The gyro meat was tasty and the veggies all tasted very fresh. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"They have a clean establishment, and they some off the best fatoush salad I have ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious! Grape leaves are great, falafel very tasty, kabobs wonderful! And very good, quick service. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"A wonderful Afghani eatery!! Tucked away in the Pheasant Run Plaza (at Stearns and Lorain) this gem of a restaurant offers tasty, healthy and fresh meals.   I've eaten here a few times,and love everything I've had. The tabouli and hummus are made fresh daily and are delicious. The baba ghanoush is just the right amount of smoky and I could eat a bowl of that alone. The Sheppard Salad is AMAZING. Seriously, I order it every time!  If you like something a little spicier, try the Ezme. It's a tomato, red pepper and spices salad. The owners are super nice as well. Another plus-they are open until 10 during the week!"}
{"text":"Great food and the business owner is also really nice! Definitely worth stopping by for some authentic Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden treasure!! If you're craving amazing kabobs, this is the spot to go to! We ate the chicken tikka kabob, the chicken wrap, and hummus, and it was all amazingly delicious! Check this place out if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. We had the Afghan Mantu (meat stuffed dumplings w/yogurt garlic sauce, chickpeas etc.) and Chicken Tikka Kabob. Everything was perfectly cooked, fresh and flavorful. We enjoyed the freshly brewed black tea which is included when you dine in. The owner was very friendly and we received great service. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Had the gyro which was overflowing with perfectly tender lamb and cooked to order. My son had the chicken wrap, which was also cooked to order and marinated to perfection. Bit limited menu, though I suspect everything is done very well."}
{"text":"We loved it! Best falafel we've ever had. We also loved the baba ganoush and the fatoush. Very generous servings and plenty of warm pita. The owner was very frindly and hospitable too."}
{"text":"Azim has the best Afghan food I have ever had.  There is a reason for  50-some odd reviews and he still holds 5 stars.  This is also the reason I decided to drive 6 miles out of the way to give it a go.  Chicken Kabob marinated and cooked to perfection.  Hummus is Grade A top notch.  Excellent rice and sauces.  Highly, highly recommended.  Park on the South side of the building."}
{"text":"The best food ever U can't get briyani like this nywhere else Their chicken tikka and chapli kabob r the best!!!"}
{"text":"THE BEST! I dream about both their rice and their red cabbage salad. *sigh* We have ordered large trays for parties and everyone  raves.  And the owners are amazing and generous.  Just give them some time to prepare your food. It is made to order and this isn't McDonalds!"}
{"text":"One of the best Afganif restaurants I have ever tried in my life, the food is just so good"}
{"text":"Great taste.  The salads and tabouli are always fresh and delicious. The meats are well seasoned.  The gyros are tasty.  The menu has some very authentic items you probably won't find anywhere else around here. So happy to have a healthy food option in the neighborhood. The chef and owner is really nice and always aiming to please."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there are no pictures to go with this review because I knew I'd be going back a second time.  I literally just walked out the door, and am writing while the memories are fresh.   To start, my girlfriend and I order some baba-- you can never go wrong with baba. Theirs was smooth and creamy, seasoned nicely, topped with plenty of olive oil, and garnished with cilantro. I've actually never had cilantro on baba, and was pleasantly surprised by the combo. Served with a basket of warm bread (whole wheat and regular I'm assuming), I was feeling pretty good before the meal came out!  For my entree, I had the Afghan Chicken Kabob. This came with fresh hummus, salad, Afghan rice, and tzatziki.  Running through the list in chronological order, the chicken, of course, was fantastic. There's a special place in my heart for that amazing charred taste in middle-eastern/mediterranean cuisine. The chicken was seasoned well, juicy, and garnished with cilantro  The hummus didn't get a chance to shine because by the time my meal came I had devoured all of the baba and need to save room for the rest of my food. I'm sure it'll get some love when I make everyone at work jealous of my leftovers tomorrow.   The salad was plain and simple, but done right. I love simple things done well, so please take this as a high compliment. The greens were crisp, tossed in lemon juice, and topped with olive oil, salt and pepper, and a tasteful amount of carrots and onion. At least This is what my gut told me was in it. Super refreshing!  Along with the salad, the rice (surprisingly) were two of the highlights of my night due to the amount of love put into what're usually minor details on the plate. The rice was very aromatic-- cooked with a small amount of what I'm assuming to be cumin seed, topped with a bit of lemon juice, and a newly discovered sour seasoning called sumac(sp?), which is dried sumac berry, and added a deep maroon color. This rice was like eating a cloud.. At least.. a tasty cloud. It was almost floral, but sour, and rich all at the same time.   Finally! The tzatziki was clearly homemade, and made everything on the plate that much better! Easily the best I've ever had! Just try it!  Overall, I think this place holds up to the reviews, so I'll be adding to the 5 stars. We'll be heading back a second time with friends in the near future!"}
{"text":"My friend I, who grab lunch around the North Olmsted area every Friday, went to Ohio Kabob Grill today for lunch for the first time. We ordered a chicken kabob, lamb kabob and a side of baba ganoush. We were totally blown away by the wonderful flavors. The baba had the strongest smokey taste, the homemade sauces were so exotic and flavorful. All item were incredibly fresh and authentic. I've only had Middle Eastern food at this level when I used to travel to The Detroit area. Skip Aladdins and try this place."}
{"text":"Absolute little Gem. The food was absolutely fantastic. Flavors were very authentic. Good spice. Excellent rice, tender chicken.   What I loved more than the food was the service. Felt like I went into someone's home. The owner - I presume- took my order then said ok, give me five minutes and sprinted to the back. I was left there hanging with the credit card in my hand. Left wondering how I should pay, I hear- sit, sit, grab a drink, just pay after you eat.  Boy did I enjoy. Delicious."}
{"text":"Finally a Afghan/Persian Resturant! This place just re-opened and I'm happy it did. The baba ganoush was great as well as the portions. They have put a spin on the traditional Afghan food but a good mix. They have gyros and falafels. The kabobs were really juicy.  Took pictures after I started eating it looked to good to wait."}
{"text":"New location, same great people, same great food.  Less parking.  Boooo, but if you want some of the best middle eastern food in Cleveland, I think this is where you want to go.  Everything else in my old review still applies."}
{"text":"Ohio Kebab just re-opened in their new location at 3359 W 117th (just south of Lorain Ave.).  My wife and I enjoyed some wonderful appetizers, eggplant, vegetables in red sauce, very tasty hummus and tabouleh, and great pita. For our entrees we had lamb, rice, corn and the delicious red cabbage salad. Got to sample two sauces, a green hot sauce with a nice burn and a nice white garlic sauce. Filled up and extra to take home. We've found our new go-to Middle Eastern/Greek restaurant. Planning on having felafel and dolmades on our next visit.  The restaurant is very nicely laid out with two dining rooms, plenty of tables, and a carpeted area with pillows for those so inclined. Also, wall artworks are tasteful and appropriate to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I travel a lot and in most cities I look for Mediterranean/ Greek / Lebanese / Afghani food.  I try to only eat clean.  This guy does a great job!  I had the lamb kabob.  If you put anything on it, you kill his beautiful taste.  Humus is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I love this place and I will be returning!  The food was fresh and the hummus was delicious!  Way better than Aladdin\"s"}
{"text":"Highly recommend, best lamb ever!!!! Food was all amazing. Service was warm and friendly. We were greeted with a warm cup of tea.  I had hummus, stuffed grape leaves, lamb, rice, tabouli, red cabbage slaw. It was all fresh, flavorful and delicious. I live about an hour away. I can't wait to get back to Cleveland and go to Ohio Kabob again :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Every part of the meal was fresh and hot. Cooked to perfection. I got the Afghani chicken kabob and my husband got the lamb kabob. Juicy and flavorful. Sides included salad which was nice and acidic and fresh. Hummus was mild in flavor, but very rich and each component could be tasted. Basmati rice was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The lamb was also perfectly cooked with well selected cuts. Wow great meal at an excellent price. Very nice restaurant, too. Clean and well cared for. Owner was very nice and attentive. Would absolutely come back again."}
{"text":"This is the best kabob I've had on the West Side.  My wife and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside and much cozier. We were greeted and looked over the menu while the owner gave us suggestions. He invited us to sit down in a cushioned area while we looked over the menu and sipped delicious sweet tea.   We order Bolani Katachalu (a turnover kind of thing filled with potatoes) and lentil soup for appetizers. We were surprised by the size of the Bolani. It took up half a large plate and was totally delicious. A great value for a couple dollars. No complaints on the lentil soup either.  Our entrees were fantastic.   The lamb kabob dish (koobideh kabob I think) came with two large lamb skewers over perfectly cooked rice with hummus, cabbage salad, and seasoned corn. Everything was delicious. The kabob were perfect. Well-seasoned, a bit charred on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside - everything kabob should be.   The lamb pulao dish my wife ordered looked like my dish (minus the corn), except her rice had raisins and roasted carrots in it. The pulao was simply delightful.   Great service, great food, a cozy atmosphere with reasonable prices. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing serving size. Would go there again. There kabuli pulao and Koobide Kabab was amazing. If you are going with a group of 4 to 5 person, you can also ask for mixed bbq platter."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. The large Gyros was packed with fresh veggies, but it lacked meat. The homemade hot sauce was outstanding. The fries were a little limp, but tasty. The Hummos was some of the best I have ever had. The service was quick and friendly, and the place was spotless. I will go there again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the meal will be remembered for a long time. It was so good, it was literally a beautiful eating experience. I ordered the veggie saute and the fattoush salad (w/o the pita pieces). I can't even put into words how good the veggie saute was, it was amazing! And the salad was also very, very good with lots of crispy veggies and herbs, but definitely took a backseat to the yummy rice dish. My husband (a huge fan of Indian biryani) ordered the chicken biryani and literally ate everything on his plate. He said the chicken is spiced differently from the Indian style he is used to and he really liked it. Afghan chicken biryani for the win! Also, the sauces brought to the table for our meal were SO GOOD: garlic sauce, tzatziki, and a spicer green sauce. They are all made in-house and I couldn't get enough of the garlic sauce, it was so good mixed into the rice and veggies. My husband really liked the tzatziki."}
{"text":"You can really taste the goodness and the flavor of the meals make here.  Hands down one of the best Middle Eastern/Mediterranean  restaurants in the Cleveland area. I advise everyone to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious and the food is fresh and made to order! I will definitely be back. The staff was very friendly and helped us since we are not very familiar with Mediterranean food. I had the chicken sauté and it was wonderful"}
{"text":"I've heard some of my friends say they tried this place so I had to as well. I met the owner he was friendly. The falafel was crispy the way I like it, the hummus was creamy and delicious. I also ordered a side of the red cabbage salad bc my friend said they really liked it, it went very well with my dish."}
{"text":"Food was okay but the atmosphere inside is like hell.. when i get inside it was so hot and really bothering when I asked they said the ac is broken ..seems like they don't care as long as they can get their hands on our wallets.  Will never go back there.."}
{"text":"From older reviews I realized this place was doing very well in the past. It was closed for sometime, and now they are back with excellent performance. The service is decent and the food is fabulous. The chef is nice and always checks with customers if they like the food. I usually order my favorite ground lamb kabab with Kabuli palaw. They have delicious spicy and garlic sauces. The kabob is probably the best I had in all of Cleveland area. So, I highly recommend it. Great in taste, quantity, and price."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in town. I have stopped here twice already and both times it was excellent. Hot fresh & fast. 5 out 5 stars."}
{"text":"We must have come on an off night.  We ordered an appetizer sampler, it never came. I ordered the shrimp kabob and the shrimp were so over cooked they were tough like leather. My husband ordered one of the chicken dishes on the menu and he liked it. The women's bathroom had urine on the floor. We were the only 2 patrons in the restaurant and our meals took 35 minutes to come out. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"It's one of those hidden surprises that makes your day when you don't expect anything new is gonna happen. The setting is humble and the food is great. I ordered a chicken kabob wrap, tikka kabob and hummus, and ate with a smile all along. Portion size is generous and food breathes freshness. Middle eastern treasure in an Ohio strip mall; who would've guessed!"}
{"text":"I'm originally from metro Detroit and they have lots of amazing middle eastern food. Well I'll tell you what my friends, this place can definitely compete with the best of them. Lentil soup is different yet amazing. The gyro is phenomenal as well. Kabob was my favorite!!! Perfectly cooked yet tasty and tender. Falafel sandwich is to live for (why would anyone want to die for food??), hands down the best falafel sandwich. Plan to get carry out again this week as I haven't had it in about 3 weeks or so. The workers and owners are so friendly, I'd come back just to mingle with them!"}
{"text":"I spent a great of time in the Middle East in various places and this is by far the best in Cleveland.  Everything I had is excellent.  Cooked perfectly and tastes authentic as can be.  I just love the salad as well.  Not a big salad guy but couldn't get enough."}
{"text":"These guys are fantastic!  Authentic and fresh.  Great customer service.  You can tell the guy really puts his heart into the food.  Quality food for sure."}
{"text":"Spectacular mid-eastern food.  I had the gyro  bowl which was made up of perfectly cooked lamb and beef, savory hummus, fresh salad, and delicious rice. I also brought home some falafel for tomorrow.  This is a great place with very fair prices and wonderful staff.  Try it!  And don't miss the Afghan tea -- it's terrific!"}
{"text":"Great late kabob lunch at Ohio Kabob Grill Restaurant. I had the hummus which was very flavorful. It was served with Nan bread.  I also had the koobideh kabob, made of ground lamb blended with saffron and onions.  The plate was complete with tabouleh ( very bright lemony taste), fluffy flavorful rice and salad.  It was a nice portion for $12.99.  I washed it down with some grape Fanta.  Overall, a wonderful Afghani meal!  I will be back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! No doubt as good as any Afghan/Persian/Indian I have had in Ohio. This is now a go to location when in and around the Olmsteds. Looking forward to additional explorations of the menu and possibly dining in! Go here for the meat, salads, and rice preparations. Seriously, pick something up today! (I don't know these people or have any investment or reward for helping them. I just know I do not want them moving this business anywhere but nearer to Ohio City/Detroit Shoreway. In case they were looking to expand or relocate.)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for almost two weeks straight.  I had a project in the Cleveland area and stayed near here last week.  The owner is so friendly and his food is so tasty that it made me come back every day this week.  I've tried many dishes on his menu and enjoyed every single one of them.  He prides himself in having a restaurant that brings loyal customers and he wants it where you enjoy it so much that you're more than happy to refer him customers.  My advice to anyone is, if you are within 45 minutes of this place, it's worth the drive to eat here.  When I'm back in the area, I will be visiting the 'Ohio Kabob Grill'.   Thanks Azim."}
{"text":"Yet another good place new to Cleveland's west side. I went there for lunch and had the Gyro Lunch Bowl (gyro meat, rice, humus, parmesan corn, red cabbage salad and a side of cucumber sauce).  The added flavors of the red cabbage salad and parmesan corn turned what would probably be a very ordinary dish in to somthing much more! Bowls also come in chili chicken and falafel.  Cons? Food was great but staff could have been a little more helpful.   I took a seat and sat there for about 5 minutes before I realized you need to order at the counter.  No one said anything?  I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"We went to the kabob place two days ago and it was an excellent decision. The food was fresh, full of afghani taste with generous portions. We called at 930pm to reserve a place and the owner made sure we get the best food without rushing us with anything. It was an awesome experience.. I loved the chicken afghani pulao and husband ordered the beef gyro.. both were extremely well cooked ! We will definitely go there asap !! =)"}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for great Mediterranean food so we trusted Yelp and tried this place. We were not disappointed. We shared hummos with nan and pita chips. Love! I could have eaten that alone and been in Heaven! I had the gyro. I was given a fork which was a little confusing...until I unwrapped it. Holy cow! Or should I say,  Holy Lamb! Overflowing with gyro meat, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, and yogurt sauce. I had to use the fork because there was no way to get my mouth around it. My wife had the chicken tikka kabob which comes with red cabbage salad and rice. She loved all of it. This establishment is in a bad location and the owner said he hopes to move somewhere more visible. He's only been open for a year and needs all the word-of-mouth advertising he can get. I don't want to see this restaurant fail now that I've got a full blown hummos (their spelling) addiction!"}
{"text":"This was my 1st time and I found this place on the Humble on Yelp. I loved it! I ordered the Chicken Tikka and the Lamb gyro and it was Delicious! Best gamble I made in 2018! Thank you for the Culinary experience! #chefworldorder"}
{"text":"Hole in a wall but good. Makes a good spicy lamb biryani and I love their fries. Good to support these places and not let fast food crapjoints pollute Westlake like the rest of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Afghani lamb kabob was the best lamb I've had in years! The owner was courteous and quick. Give this place a try if you are in the area and want some great food."}
{"text":"I had the Afghani Chicken Kebab with rice, tzatziki, and red cabbage salad. Really delicious. The chicken was tender, the rice was buttery, and the slaw was crisp and flavorful. We also had a mango lassi which was delicious. The service was great and very fast."}
{"text":"This place is located in a little strip plaza in North Olmsted. It's nothing fancy, but they are consistent and have a good menu. I work out at the gym next door and a lot of people get take out. It's always ready on time. One of my complaints is that gyros are on the menu, but they aren't authentic gyros with meat being cut from the spit. The girl working was honest and did tell me this so I didn't order it. I also thought prices were a bit high given that his place is pretty low key."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on a Monday night. The place was pretty empty, there were a few takeout orders while we were here but otherwise we were the only customers. We got the bolani sabzi palak for appetizer, it's a bread/naan/pita cooked with spinach filling inside, came with a spicy green sauce. I had the Afghani Lamb Kabob, which came with rice, hummus, a vegetable slaw and tzatziki sauce. Everything was amazing. It's kind of a whole in the wall place, but significantly cheaper than other restaurants with similar cuisine in Cleveland (I.e. Aladdin's). The chef/owner talked to us when we were heading out, and apparently he's the only one who prepares the food. Our waitress was friendly but seemed unable to answer questions about the menu items. I ended up using google. Service was fine though. Overall a great place, loved the food, loved the price point."}
{"text":"This is a small (3 tables) neighborhood place.  But I was at a nearby store and spotted it.  I was going to go to KFC and instead stopped here and am very glad I did. The Humus was fantastic and clearly fresh fresh fresh..  The lamb and salad entrée was the same, fresh and delicious.  The prices were fair.  The woman taking and filling orders said to me that they make everything from scratch and I believe it.  I am going to stop by again as its right by Stearns which I take to get to 480 from Avon. Its just a half a block from the Lorain and Stearns Intersection, slightly east of that intersection on the south side.   Opened in August according to the woman working there.   Its not fancy its not upscale. Its clean, delicious and enjoyable.  If you like Aladdin type food then they is a great spot to add to your places to visit.  So my 5 stars is not it compared to like Aladdin which is a fancier place but comparable to neighborhood places and in that regard it deserves a 5 star rating.   I both ate in and they packaged everything I could not eat to go then.  Wonderful service."}
{"text":"Great food. We had the chicken tikka and lamb shish kabob. Also the samosa was great."}
{"text":"Hands down the best middle eastern/kabob place in Cleveland!   Found this place on yelp so decided to give it a try since it's got great reviews and I am SO glad I was able to try this place out.   The host was very nice and funny, and the atmosphere felt very home-y.  I decided on the chapli kabob and he recommended the chicken tikka kabob. The two dishes came with rice, hummus and delicious red cabbage salad. Usually chicken can get dry but these were cooked to perfection.   He also served us homemade Greek tzaziki sauce and jalapeño pepper chutney. Everything about this place screamed AUTHENTIC! I would definitely come here and try more of their menu or even come in for their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent.  I have had to-go orders 3 times and have been perfect every time.  Shepherd salad is excellent and super fresh.  Hummus and pita is very fresh and well balanced.  The Afghan chicken entree comes with rice and red cabbage salad, all of which is delicious.  I highly recommend this place.  They work hard to ensure you come back. Great food."}
{"text":"Super super delish.. low key place with great service and delicious food. The chicken Tika kabob.. with humus and salad.. very good!"}
{"text":"I dont usually write resturant reviwes, but the quality and taste of the food here gave me no choice but to write this comment, they make Kabab as it is supposed to be done. Keep the good work guys."}
{"text":"They have gained a regular! I got the chicken tikka which was delicious! It came with rice,grilled tomatoe pepper and onion and salad. It was $11 and filled me up!  Everything was on point and delicious . The place is kind of hidden in the plaza behind Sunoco on lorain. Def would recommend this place. I carried out but they have some tables and chairs in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! It's hard to find somewhere that my husband, son and I all enjoy, that isn't a chain or fast food. This was delightful. We started with the stuffed grape leaves which had a wonderful sweetness to them. My son got a chicken wrap that he couldn't put down. My husband got the lamb kabob, and commented on how much he loved the floral notes. I got the Afghani chicken kabob, and couldn't get over how tender and moist the chicken was. We finished with the baklava which tasted like a little sticky slice of heaven. The staff is wonderful, and had the patience to explain everything to us, and offer samples. We will definitely be making a return trip sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! From the food to the people making and serving it.. The place was scrumptious!!"}
