{"text":"A great place with great music on Sunday. The food is amazing, we had empanadas, pan-chori, entrana steaks, Malbec wine, and their Argentinian cookie dessert. The owners is super friendly and very hospitable."}
{"text":"Very friendly chef/owner.  Great food and fantastic Malbec wine!  DJ music and shrieking girls at next table (celebrating bday) made the place too loud and uncomfortable to carry a conversation.   But overall it was a fun experience."}
{"text":"Great food! The only place in the city ordering their beef from Argentina! And as someone who has visited Argentina, let me say that my trip brought me some of the best steak bites of my life. 

The room is dark and feels intimate, but there's actually a lot of space. I get the feeling that the vibe may be a little different on weekends during the week, since DJ's are brought in. Expect the DJ to have a cathedral-like perch above the diners, and they will be in the zone. 

Two big highlights were the steak platter and the empanadas. I could drink the chimichurri sauce! It is the perfect accompaniment to both dishes. The steak platter also came with spiced beets and a salad which are nice & fresh additions but let's be real, it's all about that meat and sauce. The steak was oh so tender. By the end, I was picking up slices by hand and licking my fingers. 

Good neighbourhood spot! Also, the chef used to own a food truck and it's always nice to see/support people spreading their wings to live their dreams. 

Note: don't miss this place by walking by! It's up the stairs, above the convenience store."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this new place in a neighbourhood in a spot that has not had a successful tenant in years.
Walked in on a Friday night at 8 and the DJ was in full effect at a decibel level making it pretty much impossible to have a conversation without raising your voice.  
After the waiter said it would get \"wild in here in an hour\" that was our cue to leave even though the food looked good, we finished our drink and went somewhere else. 
In short, this self proclaimed \"resto lounge\" belongs on King West not West Queen West."}
{"text":"Argentinian beef flown in fresh! 
The ambiance going into week 2 of this restaurant was great! This place is going to be hot for the dinner pre-party crowd. A DJ booth is set up and the music was good all night. 
The food was an extension but of the food truck previously owned by the same group. So, some snack foods like empanadas and guacamole were tasty and tried and true. The mains are a real standout. Beef and duck mains are served in a beautiful carved wooden plate/bowl with salad, beets, and potatoes. And the chimichurri sauce was amazing. 
Only issues were that the beet salad I ordered as a starter was essentially the same as the main. They should take the salad off the menu or at least warn people that you'll be getting lots of beers. The guacamole was good but 1 would have been more than enough (it was piled high). So, half the price and just give me one? 
Very cool vibe and amazing Argentina beef."}
{"text":"Went to AMA last night for date night and it was absolutely incredible. Stephanie behind the bar was knowledgeable and paid attention to detail in regards to my allergies. The ambiance is extraordinary and perfect for an intimate setting. From the guac to empanadas (TO DIE FOR) and finally a carefully crafted plate of steak, salad, beets and mashed potato... the food is better than any other restaurant I've eaten at in Toronto. We also ordered a bottle of Malbec (house wine) and it paired so well with our dinner. Hands down!!! Highly recommend this place :):):):)"}
{"text":"If i could do ZERO stars I would. 

Walked in at 8:30 on a Saturday night, I live next door and thought I would finally check this place out. Sat ourselves at the bar, ordered a cocktail. And within 5 minutes a server and manager came over to tell us the bar has been booked out at 9pm and we wouldn't be able to stay. 
Didn't ask us if we wanted to finish our cocktails or anything, there still was 30 mins I would've gladly finished my drink and left with a good impression. 

Instead I left with my mouth as dry as the managers attitude.  

Good. Luck."}
{"text":"Love the experience  definitely will go back, the appetizers were delicious we had the grilled calamari and the guacamole tostadas, it was delicious and off course we had the entra√±a as our main and it was just like if we were in Argentina fingerlicking delicious....."}
{"text":"Heard about AMA through Instagram. Was very interested in checking it out as they feature different local DJ's starting at 8pm and play awesome house music!! Finally was able to visit last night for a date night and I am still smiling over our experience. 

We were greeted warmly the moment we sat down. Our server was knowledgeable and so friendly and engaging. We had the ceviche and a grilled calamari which was a special for the evening. Both were fabulous and seasoned perfectly. Then shared the rib eye between us and it was honestly the best steak I've had in Toronto or ever!! And it came with 3 delicious sides. Chef and owner told us that is was flown from Argentina that morning. It was melt in your mouth and completely insane. 

The music created the vibe and just completed the whole feel of the place. Such a gem of a venue and can't wait to return!! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner and great service. We ordered the (vegan) vegetable amore platter and vegetarian empanadas. The platter was to die for, hands down best vegetable dish I've ever had and was totally filling for 2 people. The chef/owner is very friendly!"}
{"text":"I would give ama 6 stars if I could!  The food, service and atmosphere were all great!  Incredible drinks and food!  Large whiskey and tequila selection. Ribeye, sausage, and guacamole were among the best I've had.  Great for small group of friends or date night. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now. All times were delicious.
2 times I got the steak. It is flavourful and filling . You don't get to pick sides but they're good. Usually a salad , roasted beets and a potatoes of some sort.

The other time I came for brunch. Got the steak and eggs and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Ama Always used to run out of a food truck, but has now converted into a regular restaurant that opened up about 5 weeks ago. The atmosphere is nice, but music was too loud to try and have a conversation without yelling.

Our server was extremely friendly and very attentive. Even the chef came out to check on us, which was a nice gesture. However, a few things that wasn't great:
- Menu is very limited (ok for a food truck, but a regular restaurant should have a more diverse menu).
- For a place with a big bar and DJ, they don't have beers on tap, just a limited selection of bottles. Flying Monkey craft brewery is right next door, so I was tempted to sneak a beer in from there! 
- They serve food on plastic plates, again ok for a food truck but unacceptable for a restaurant at this price point.
- Main entrees come with salad and a couple of sides, but these same items are listed as appetizers on the limited menu and we weren't explicitly told that they are the same.
- The price is way too high for the quality and portion of the food.

The empanadas were quite tasty, but $9 for two tiny vegetarian pastries is too expensive.

The 7 oz entrana steak was tender and very tasty. It came with salad and sides of sweet potatoes and beets (which was overcooked and burnt). But again, too pricey at $32 for just a 7 oz skirt steak, which is one of the cheapest cuts of meat. But the meat was super flavorful and I enjoyed this dish very much.

The Pescado del Dia, was a very small white snapper fish for $36. The exact same salad and 2 sides as the steak entree, so boring and not much variety. The fish was under-cooked and what made it worse was the fish didn't seem fresh (very fishy smell). We were told they have just 4 snappers left and then they were going to switch to some other fish, so perhaps our fish was from the last shipment and had already started to go bad. Regardless, even if the fish was fresh, it was tiny and way overpriced at $36. I've been to so many other restaurants that serve  whole Branzino twice the size, perfectly grilled, for less. So this dish was certainly a disappointment...

This restaurant has the potential to be great, but has lots of room for improvement. Both the Empanadas and Entrana steak were delicious. The service and atmosphere was great. However the white snapper was a disaster, the sides were duplicated in the appetizers and accompanied both entrees, resulting in very little variety. Personally, I think this restaurant is still run like its out of a food truck, which isn't a bad thing. But to justify charging the price that it does, it needs time to mature into a proper restaurant (get rid of plastic plates and improve and diversify the menu). Until some changes are made, not interested in coming back..."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian plate I have ever tried. It was a Wednesday special so we had $1 empanadas all night! Great cocktails and vibe!!! Chef Sebastian's Guacamole and chori-pan must try!!!!!! Very friendly stuff, definitely going back."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant to check out! 
I would highly recommend making reservations esp If looking to book during prime time! 

Food is delicious and fresh! Sebastian the chef is charismatic and super amazing. The restaurant was not very busy as we came by right after work and he made the effort to come out and say hi. 

The portions are big so I would recommend sharing.

We ordered the beef empanadas and they were delicious. We ordered a double chori-pan was outstanding, I'm still dreaming about it! And lastly we ordered the entrana- the meat was shipped from Argentina and fabulously prepared.

Highly recommend! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably a top 5 latin restaurant that I have tried in Toronto. The steak is incredible. I don't eat beets, but there I do. The server was very friendly too."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We tried the $75 tasting menu and it was just out of this world. The course were exceptionally flavourful and the ribeye just topped off an already great meal. The ribeye came with a heavy drizzle of chimichurri and the herb and sour flavour mix was really enjoyable. I would highly recommend you check out this place."}
{"text":"This place is seriously good, with excellent tasting Argentinian food.  Empanadas, while small, which an appetizer should be, are seriously bursting with flavour.  The Chorizo pan is a sandwich appetizer with rich and smokey chorizo, and marinated peppers, which is delicious.  The Entrana is an 8 oz skirt steak shipped directly from Argentina (you can taste it) slathered in a savoury excellent chimichurri sauce, served with potatoes, fried beets, and a very good light arugula salad in a nice wooden platter.  Price is not cheap, but it seriously out-flavours the haute cuisine/tasting menu joints where you pay more and I was more than sated.  Complimentary Amaro as a digestif to end it all off."}
{"text":"If there were 6 stars I would give them!!! This was an amazing experience! Sebastian and his team (Ryan and Alejandro) made sure we had the BEST time.
The pinnacle of hospitality.
Course after course, we squealed with delight at the creations. Chorizo and potatoes masterfully combined with fresh tomatoes at the peak of flavor. Beautifully grilled steak and chimichurri with delicate arugula salad. Grilled duck and tomatoes. Ribeye with marinated vegetables. Avocado and tomatoes with perfect tostones. Beets pan fried with farm cheese sprinkled on top and dressed delicately. And the grand finale of chocolate tartlets and dulce de leche. Did I mention the wine pairings? Amazing.
The entire evening was one of my top 10 restaurant experiences. The music was incredible (down tempo worth good beats), the lighting superb, the interior tastefully subdued with beautiful touches. The wall is the fence from Sebastian's childhood home in Argentina.
Everything was perfect. I cannot recommend it enough!!!
And they have $1 empanadas on Wednesday!!"}
{"text":"Lovely interior, red and dark like a sultry lounge. The food is delicious, best taken tapas style, I think. Argentinian and Italian influenced meats, which were perfectly cooked. Best I've had in Toronto. I do recommend. I give it a 4/5 only because I reserve 5/5 for something completely extraordinary."}
{"text":"The empanadas were very small!.... they tasted meh!! Nothing special..I would probably come back as a default choice if all the restaurants I like are fully booked and I need to eat something before it gets late."}
{"text":"Who'd have known the best vegetarian platter I have had in Toronto would come from an Argentinian restaurant? I went to Ama for their ribeye a few weeks ago and it was to die for, went back last night and didn't feel like meat with this heat,l and tried the veggie platter instead: I couldn't be more satisfied! 10 different types of super fresh vegetables cooked to perfection, salad, guac, their amazing mashed potatoes. What an amazing surprise!"}
{"text":"AMA is a discreet Argentinian place on Queen W near Ossington. The room is dark and comfortably furnished, well suited to steaks and red wine. My rib steak was one of the best I've had, cooked perfectly and served with chimichurri sauce. The guacamole on toast was also excellent. Service was very good and knowledgeable. Nice wine list. Definitely worth trying especially if you enjoy South American beef."}
{"text":"My gin and tonic was delicious. I should leave it at that, but I won't. I became aware of this \"place\" by an Instagram post of their shrimp ceviche. I love a good ceviche, and it was, good.

The entree was a whole other story. I had the 7oz Carne (medium rare)...tough, over cooked, charred in some places. It was a poorly cooked portion of skirt steak that is boasted as being grain fed or hormone free or something. At $35 I expected some complex flavours only to be disappointed. My dinner companion experienced the exact same displeasure. 

The music was extremely loud to the point that everyone was shouting. I understand that AMA turns into a club at night but this was before 9pm. The staff were all great, extremely attentive and seemed to be having a good time. 

I won't go back for dinner, maybe for a drink. In my opinion there are many great restaurants in the area offering a better version of the same."}
