{"text":"Very good gyros with clever names. They put more meat on their gyros than most other Greek places. Service was great."}
{"text":"I'm a long time customer good food horrible customer service. Ordered my norm I always order picked it up & when I got home all 3 gyros were completely burned so I called they took my info & asked me if I wanted to come back out I declined so they told me next time I call in give them my name & no. & they would make me 3 new gyros on my next order. Well that didn't happen they said there was no way to confirm what I'm saying. So their employees don't do their job & I popgot screwed out of my food they actually owe me.  Really I'm gonna try to work them for 3 gyros I order there all the time. They made me out a liar which I am not & lost a good paying customer along with my entire family & close circle of friends. Oh well their loss I'll drive to The Villa in Ambridge for my gyros & Greek grub no prob at all!"}
{"text":"The gyro I had was ok.  Meat was dry and the sauce did not have much flavor.  They were out of spinach pie too."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the gyros at this place!  I used to think that Mike & Tony's gyros (in the southside) were the best I had ever had.  That was until I tried here.  I usually get either the regular gyro or the Zeus gyro (has fries in the gyro).  The gyros are always enormous with more than enough meat, veggies and sauce - and I get that for under $7.  Definitely a must try if you are a gyro fan.  And have a TON of napkins... you'll need it!  :)"}
{"text":"These guys make a good gyro! They're similar to mike & Tony's in the south side. I haven't tried anything else on their menu, but if you're looking for a good gyro I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best gyro around. Large and flavorful. I would recommend them to anyone The service was friendly and quick. Great menu with a lot of variety. Get it to go or dine in."}
{"text":"These beat even the original mike and Tony's hands down my favorite gyros outside the city I especially like that they have a spicy tatziki and many other kinds the meat is fantastic and the gyro is huge definitely get your money's worth here!"}
{"text":"Yelp says 12-7 Sunday. Door sticker says 12-7 Sunday. Piece of paper in the window says \"closed Sunday's\""}
{"text":"Crappy food. We ordered chicken gyros. Chicken was burnt. I felt like eating rubber. I am not going to this place again. Dont order chicken here"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best gyros I have ever eaten!   The smell alone brought tears of joy to my heart and my taste buds.  The long search for a good gyros in da burgh is finally over. I knew this was the place when they actually knew how to correctly pronounce gyros ( no small feat in da burgh) the lettuce was excellent the pita was perfectly cooked, but oh the meat, sooo much flavor I can't properly do it justice. And the home made sauce is amazing !  The service was quick and friendly. And it was prepared and ready for me much sooner than I expected. The prices are surprisingly low for how big the portions are. As this place is relatively close to my house I will be sure to visit as often as possible.  And I highly suggest you do as well !"}
{"text":"Very mediocre gyro. While the portion is generous, the meat is dry and not Greekally spiced enough. The meat was cold, not EVEN warm. I keep going back hoping that they'll get it right, but I always leave unsatisfied."}
{"text":"The \"Hades\" gyro was recommended by a friend and according to the menu it's their #1 seller.    So I decided to try \"Hades\" today and the gyro is no doubt  ..the best.  The Hades.. A few french fries are nestled at the bottom of the pita and then fresh ingredients; chopped white onions, fresh lettuce and the tomatoes were not doubt the freshest in town - they had a little seasoning on them topped with plentiful lamb..  the gyro just oozes pure perfection!    The sauce on the Hades wasn't just traditional cucumber sauce..  it had a little kick to it.  I think it was cucumber sauce with a hint of \"franks red hot\" in it.  It was spicy but not too much."}
{"text":"Decent Greek fare. Everytime I try to order chicken I'm told it will be 20 mins because we don't have any ready. Last time I went, there was a goth girl working the counter with zero people skills.So bad, I walked out and ate lunch elsewhere.  Not a very good first impression for you business."}
{"text":"After a night spent in a bar overlooking other people chowing down on bar gyros, I found myself craving one myself. Of course, if I can choose to have it elsewhere, I certainly will, and this wound up putting me at Olympos Gyros today. After seeing the menu online, I was already excited by the many different names and styles. This is the first place I've been to which used different mixes of Tzatziki sauce, and that concept grabbed my attention from the start. I went for the ranch Tzatziki on the Poseidon, and my buddy took the spicy Hades. Both were prepared quickly and much to my expectations, they were piled high with meat, lettuce, and another surprise, French fries. Needless to say, I was prepared for what would come next. The first bite had me hooked, and the next minutes were nothing but working to devour the rest of this masterpiece. I've been going to Robert Morris for the past three years and was upset that it took this long to find this great place. I hope to come back as soon as next week, but this will definitely be in my thoughts as next semester approaches."}
{"text":"I noticed a few reviews mentioned Mike & Tony's as a comparison. I will say, I've been going to Mike & Tony's for 20+ years and then a friend recommended Olympos and said it was better. Ugh, sacrilege!! However, to prove my friend wrong, I had to try this place. To my surprise, Olympos was delicious and, dare I say, better than Mike & Tony's. If you've been a long time Mike & Tony's fan, Olympos will remind you of Mike & Tony's from 15 years ago...back when Mike & Tony's loaded your gyro with a ridiculous amount of meat, put oregano on top of your gyro, and had more spices in their sauce. I will say that Olympos is considerably more expensive for my usual order ($14) compared with Mike & Tony's ($8.50); however, I will gladly pay the price difference. Olympos has a better location that avoids the non-sense of South Side, has free parking, is cleaner, and has better clientele. They also just implemented a rewards program so you can earn free food. I still love my Mike & Tony's gyro, but Olympos ranks right up there. You can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"This place is kind of hit or miss.  Sometimes the food is great, sometimes its pretty bad.  I guess it just depends on who is cooking that day.  It not a bad looking place all and all, but they could have a better drink selection (especially diet options) and every time I go in there I have to walk through a cloud of smoke out front from the employees who throw their butts in the parking lot.  That kind of dulls the appetite."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro. I've found the closer you get to Pittsburgh, the better the gyros. Also, small hole in the wall/side of the road type places never disappoint. Nice hefty gyro, you won't leave hungry. Tzatziki sauce and seasoning was great. Also, I will now request feta cheese on my gyros from now on. Amazing.  Lots of what I'd call Pittsburgh-style gyros with fries and feta wrapped inside. Next time I come by, I will try one of these."}
{"text":"Stopped here today on a whim, and boy were we glad we did! I'm Greek, so I've been rather picky with my gyros in the past. These happened to be some of the best ones I have ever had! Their tzaztiki sauce was so delicious and tasted home made & their gyro meat was fresh & thick! Our gyros were HUGE, so much so that my husband could hardly even finish his. I have some grape leaves I'll be heating up for a snack tonight, but if they are anywhere near as good as my gyro is, I'm sure to love them. ((They are huge, also)) I highly recommend this spot for a delicious gyro!"}
{"text":"A major disappointment!  I've been wanting to try this place for sometime.  Based on the other great reviews, I was hopeful.  Sadly, my experience did not measure up.  Ordered chix gyro and gyro salad.  The pita bread was  burnt but that was good since it complimented the excessively charred meat! It was suppose to be chicken but I am honestly not sure because it was so burnt I could not absolutely tell whether it was chicken, pork, or beef.  I cannot imagine how they could think it okay to give this to someone to eat!  The gyro salad was not burnt but the lettuce was limp and sour.  The gyro meat was good as was the few French fries on top."}
{"text":"This is a solid lunch place.  Food was fresh and good. Almost a 4 rating."}
{"text":"I love gyros and when I saw the reviews that Olympos got I knew I needed to stop by.  First of all, this is a small storefront in a non-descript shopping center - pay close attention to your GPS.  It is the parking lot next to MedExpress which might be a little easier to spot on the road.  As mentioned in other reviews, this is a no-frills place with 6 tables scattered about a room with limited decor.  The dining room is on the dark side and the menu is on the wall on the left as you walk in.  You order at the back on the right.  The counter folks are pretty gruff and not interested in conversation.  They had 2 cones going and were regularly slicing.  I thought the meat was on the dry side, but the portions were good sized and the veggies fresh - oregano on top was a nice touch.  I got two sauces on the side - bbq and spicy - and thought that neither were particularly flavorful.  Overall, a mediocre experience.  Gyropolis in Minneapolis is my gold standard, but I feel that My Big Fat Greek Gyro in the burgh does a better job in nicer surroundings."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week--sometimes twice.  I always order their salad, grilled chicken or large gyro salad and they . are. SO . gooddddd !!!  I work in Robinson, but live on the other side of the city and on my days off find myself craving them.  I always call ahead and I'm in and out for pick up. Pita bread on the side is amazing too (although usually I ask for them to hold it so I'm not eating all the carbs).  Try it. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"We've had catering at my salon from this place! It's amazing and they set it all up! Truly a great family business to support! Helpful, quick, punctual, and high quality! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to Olympus Gyros today for lunch after I had searched for a new spot on my iPhone app. I walked in and I was the only customer. I ordered within 2 minutes of walking in, the #9 (The Artemis sandwich) which is just veggies, feta cheese and french fries, along with a side of hummus. I paid and as I was waiting for my order, another gentleman came in and sat at the counter to be served before me. It took them 20 minutes to prepare my food for a takeout, while I was the only one there. There were 3 workers, and none of them were friendly. The food was pretty good, but I don't think I'd go back and spend over $10 for a to-go lunch."}
{"text":"I am most certainly a fan of this mom-and-pop hole in the wall. It's a quaint little establishment just outside of the busy Robinson Township shopping area. As a warning before entering the shop, don't expect enthusiastic or friendly service. If you want a delicious gyro sandwich with a distinct Pittsburgh flare, I highly recommend one of their gourmet delights! A personal favorite of mine is doused with their spicy Tzatziki sauce, earning it the menu title of Hades."}
{"text":"Veggie gyro was ok, nothing special, pretty basic. Do like the added french fries, was a nice touch. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but it is a nice option if you're already in Robinson and don't want to eat at one of the corporate chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I ordered a standard Chicken Gyro.  It was very tasty, packed and very satisfying.  The Tzatiziki (know i'm misspelling that) was very well done too.   I'm going with a 3/5 though because the staff was considerably gruff, and seemed very gurff when confirming my order, which was done very flatly. There was not personableness with either person working.  I was also given improper change for my gyro and they refused to correct their mistake.  I paid with a $10 bill for a ~$7.50 gyro and received considerably less than the 2.50 i was owed."}
{"text":"Where is the Uozo and Flaming Cheese (OPA!)  I want to say a big Thank You to the Yelpers for alerting me to Olympos Gyros.    I miss Gyros.  I ordered the Hades Gryo.    Mounds of Gryo Meat, French Fries, with ample amounts of lettuce, tomato, feta, and cucumber sauce (tzatziki) for about $7.  The Gyro had the right balance of flavor you expect.    The portions were large but I was able to keep my place in the clean plate club.  If you want an old school gyro  - this is the place.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried Olympos Gyros out for lunch today.  It's lent, and in Pittsburgh that means long lines for fish sandwiches, so I figured it'd be quick, and since I'm almost certainly going to burn in hell anyway...why not eat meat?  It was quick, so at the very least I'm half right.  I ordered the \"Zeus\" off the \"specialty\" menu and got my gyro in about 5 minutes.    It was slightly too big to carry in the little brown paper bag they give you so I had to cradle it like a newborn on the way to the car.  After I unwrapped it back in my office I thought maybe they'd forgotten the pita...because I couldn't see it.    The Zeus is Chris Farley's proverbial \"Fat Guy in a Little Coat\"...it was messy and there was so much stuff inside the pita that the pita itself couldn't be found.  Once I did find it, I spent probably three minutes trying to figure out the best way to hold it without it turning into a complete nightmare.  (There is no best way).    Tasted great.  I loved it.  But okay, seriously...Greeks, it's okay to make a pita slightly larger so that you can accommodate more stuff.  Pitas do NOT have to be one size fits all.  Or wait...do they?  Is that one of those weird ethnic rules that a REAL pita will only measure 1/2 cubit in diameter or something?  I don't think that's a thing.  Is that a thing?  Anyway...super good, fast, cheap, consider a fork, or barter for a bigger pita."}
{"text":"The secret of the GYRO!!!!  This gyro place is a little secret out there in Robinson.  They might not provide the friendliest service but the food tops it off.  It is a very small restuarant and most people seem to do take out.  It is a bit far from my house so I usually eat in.  There is usually a table available...even on a Friday or Staurday night!    It appears to be family owned and operated as sometimes I can't understand the gentleman in the back!    The food is great and in large quantities.  They provide a variety of options to get your gyro and the cucumber sauce is fantastic.  I suggest that if you love GYROS as I do...try it out.  You will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome gyro. Might even be my new fave. Hummus is very good too. Definitely worth a taste.   Service is \"meh\", but family places can be that way."}
{"text":"In regards to the great secret underground Pittsburgh Gyro War, everyone has their favorite and is loyal! Twenty years or so ago, there would be no question... Zorbas' downtown (in the original location, on Wood St., I think), is the best that there will EVER be. (period)... end of story.  BUT since that gem is long gone, and, sorry, the NEW location for Zorba's doesn't come close, & EVERY pizza joint and food truck now sell gyros, who has the best?      I tried several of the pizza shop gyros, and most of them were just ok.  They were all about the same... so to save time I decided not to include the pizza shops in my search.  Prior to Zorba's, Salonika's on 6th was the place to go (until Zorba went AWOL & opened his own place!). I had heard for years that Mike & Tony's was THE place, so I finally gave in and gave them a try... just to be fair.  Again, the gyro was just pretty good. Nothing great. It could have come from a vendor at any street fair. I know how rabid their crowd is, and how they insist that Mike & Tony's is the Holy Grail of the Pittsburgh Gyro, but I'm betting most of those gyros are the ones you get at 2AM after you get your drunk on.  My Big Fat Greek Gyro in Market Square (deceased) was VERY good, as were most of the other gyros from all of the other places that I have tried (the 'Burgh has a surprisingly large number of Greek restaurants)!    I thought that I found something at the Central Diner in Robinson when I ordered their killer gyro platter. Tasty.  But after today's re-visit to the mighty Olympos, I think I have my winner. I have tried several of the different style gyros here, and they have all been AWESOME.  Great flavor, generous portions, and always consistent.  I've never had a bad gyro from this place!  If not the BEST in the area, it has to be in the top 2!    I intend to keep exploring and searching for the BEST gyro in the 'Burgh, but to be honest the search will be a bit slower, as I intend to come back to Olympos more often!"}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break one friday. The service was quick and good thing we got there early (before 1130) because it filled up rapidly!  We got just a normal gyro, glad I didn't go for the upgraded version with fries ON it (so Pittsburgh) because that would have been too much food for me. As it was, the sandwich was delicipus, the meat wasn't dry and there was a good ratio of veggies. Would def come back!"}
{"text":"The Hades gyro is amazing! Huge gyro with fries and spicy Tzatziki sauce. I'm typically a Mike & Tony's girl but Olympos gives them a run for their money."}
{"text":"This place was just awesome. Got the chicken gyro. The Apollo. The chicken was tender and the food was right of the grill. So good for the rainy day. Really cheap. Just loved it. Stop in and get. And eat it with your hands!"}
{"text":"Good lord it's like mike and Tony's and primantis had a love child. Don't be fooled by the location, it is the hidden gem we are all searching for. The grape leaves were very good, but not as lemony as I'm used to. But the hades. Fellow yelpers I can not thank you enough for alerting me to this masterpiece. This thing is huge and we shared it, the meat was perfectly cooked and deliciously seasoned. The fries on the gyro were a stroke of genius and the spicy taziki, well I may never eat regular taziki again. Service was quick and very friendly. I would totally drive the hour down to robinson again to have another one of these."}
{"text":"The Gyros are GREAT! The service was HORRIBLE! The 2 guys working this afternoon would rather have been anywhere else. Not a \"hello\" \"thank you\" or ANY acknowledgment that I was spending my money. I understand being busy... but a welcoming \"Hello\" goes a long way. Seems that the customers were a bother to them. I said \"thank you\" as I left ... and got a \"Yep\". Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch at least once a month and I am never disapointed. the decore  is sky blue like your at the top of Mt. Olympus eating with the gods of Greece. the monitors are a nice touch. the best part is easily the food the gyro meat is excellent the Tzatziki sauce is perfect. one day I will get up the courage to try the mount olympus challenge but until then I will have to settle for a large delicious gyro in a tucked away gem of a place."}
{"text":"don´t let the small and modest front. Delicious Gyro´s one of my favorite´s places very autentic. ok the fry's option is not. But we have one with fries and other w/o. we like them both. I may have it with fry's again next time. great seasoning.  fresh veggies.Very friendly and customer service drived staff. will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was incredible- I had the Zeus and my husband had the Hades- both were SO GOOD! We also had a side of hummus and pita- the hummus was super garlicky and delicious, and the pita was warm. I've been wanting to eat here for a long time and I'm so thankful I finally did! Great people, great place!!"}
{"text":"Good and unpretentious! This is the best gyro I've had in the Pittsburgh area. My favorite is the shish kabob gyro (the Hermes), absolutely delsih. But really, they're all pretty amazing. I believe this is a family-owned joint and it sure feels like one. The tzatziki sauce is super as well."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a work function, and I have to say, being a lover of gyros, this place is in my top 3... and that's including Pittsburgh,  Boston and Manchester NH.  I sought this place out based on Yelp reviews, and then ordered the Hades, which had a slightly spicy tzaziki sauce.   As the reviews all suggest, you don't come here for ambiance, although the company (other customers) is pleasant.  The owner is less than conversational, but that pales in comparison to how good and the portion this food is.    I'm going to make this my staple lunch place for whenever I fly in to the airport, and I ordered the locals and business travelers are like to do the same. Well done, John."}
{"text":"We both ordered the regular gyro platter, which included the huge, piled high gyro, Greek salad, and a side of fries.  With a bottle of soda each, we were $24 into the best gyro experience ever.  This is can't miss stuff.  Get it while it's hot."}
{"text":"This review is not based on their food. I understand this is a no frills place but the atmosphere left much to be desired. I thought well the service must make up for it........I was wrong. There was one lady in front of me and the place was empty. I was not greeted nor looked up at.  Once it was my turn to order, the man was very brute and unfriendly.   I decided to leave and go to the family owned Greek diner \" Central Diner & Grill\" down the street. They actually acknowledge you and have fresh Dolmas and gyro meat."}
{"text":"Just wow.  My dad used to take me to a little hole in the wall in Bellevue NE in the basement of Southroads Mall, and the gryo i just ate from Olympos took me back 30 years to that hole in the wall....and kicked that gyros butt."}
{"text":"I've now been to Olympos a handful of times and I have to say, I'm never disappointed.   While it is in a very unassuming spot on Steubenville Pike, it delivers a punch when it comes to their gyros. I originally stuck with the standard gyro, but the #4 (Hera) is just the perfect combination. It has BBQ Tzatziki sauce and it is just delicious, it also comes with fries and an onion ring ON THE GYRO. I couldn't get enough.   I suggest this place to anyone that wants a solid gyro in the Robinson area."}
{"text":"Good portions and the food is really good,  it is in a little shopping center right by med express"}
{"text":"Awesome gyros. Mostly a take out place however there are a few tables to sit and eat. May be the best gyro I've ever eaten. No doubt it was the most meat that I've ever had on a gyro! Delicious! Can't wait till I go back for more. Friendly service"}
{"text":"I haven't hit up all of the gyro spots in Pittsburgh quite yet, but Olympos Gyros has been my favorite gyro since my first visit. I always get an original or a Zeus if I am in the mood for fries. Their tzatziki is delicious, and their gyros are always overflowing with filling. Plenty of meat and plenty of toppings. Their baklava is delicious as well. I drive from Pleasant Hills just to eat there, even if I have no other business in Robinson. Worth the drive every time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely positively the BEST gyro I have ever had. Just a small hole in the wall but it's packin the best dang gyro I ever tasted.  Try it, and you'll agree!"}
