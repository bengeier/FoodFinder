{"text":"What an amazing place to enjoy good food. I have been to this restaurant more than 30 times, since I live right next to it. The food is amazing overall. I highly recommend their shish taouk and shrimp sandwich, which both are quite amazing. The lineup is usually long, so expect 15min at least before you get your food. The price of their sandwiches are higher compared to other restaurants in Montreal, but the experience is great overall!"}
{"text":"one of the cleanest freshest place for sandwishes and grills. Bravo"}
{"text":"The place took a dive for the worst, lately.  The prices went up and the portions went down. Same old decor and the service from the new staff is rude as half the old workers probably quit.  Gave their grill another try and they actually cheat about the amount being sold. half a kilo is actually closer to a quarter of a kilo -I actually weight it on a kitchen scale because another yelper mentioned it- and it costs 20$. That means for an actual half kilo it would be around 40$ from a deli-like store! That's just absurd.  I gave it a 2 star because of the above and their only saving grace was the sandwiches which now contain smaller portions of meat and are even pricier. Greed at work is not a pretty sight.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Let's talk about facts. Abou Elias has deliciouuuuuusssssss grilled lebanese food, as tasty as back home I would say.  Dont expect much in terms of decor or atmosphere as it is more of a takeaway, but the people are friendly and nice, good'ol leb hospitality :)"}
{"text":"I ADORE THIS PLACE. Their sandwiches are to die for, everytime I fly to Montreal I must stop by there and enjoy a kafta or chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"Always fresh and tasty. The filet mignon it's my favourite. Excellent service for a quick tasty snack."}
{"text":"Total score.  Totally authentic, coal fired grill, tender high quality meat, fresh falafel, fresh pita.  Kafta was outrageous and Milan the proprietor upon finding out that me and my guest were from our of town went out of his way to make sure we were welcomed in his establishment.  See you next time Abu Eliaa! !"}
{"text":"best shish tawooq sandwiches and shrimp tawooq and table sandwiches and also the big sized BBQ platter. extremely tasty, and is always on my to go places at Montreal. its not a place to sit down at, just grab and go"}
{"text":"Ive avoided the sandwiches for my past 2-3 visits and stuck to the kilo mix or kibbe nayeh and they are back in my good graces.  Simply delicious despite the iffy service"}
{"text":"Good service, not really pricy. First, we order (for two) big mixed grill platter,  we payed around $25.  The last time, I ordered the Grilled Sujuk Sausage Sandwich on blistered pita with garlic paste and Levantine pickles and it was the best sandwich I ever had in all my life"}
{"text":"Probably the best shish taouk sandwhich I've had. Sine the meat is cooked on charcoal you get that taste of bbq and it's great.  Service is pretty fast but not friendly... unless you speak Arabic."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap and tasty kefta pita sandwich. It's a butcher shop with charcoal grills. Simple setup, no frills and famous for exactly that. I always get two of the kefta and each sandwich costs about $4.50. Parking can be crazy, people doing all kinds of illegal maneuvers and double parking, but that's almost part of the fun. Lots of meat choices for your pita, from liver to steak."}
{"text":"I loved taking out the shish taouk from this place until recently.  Service: first of all, the lady at the counter is rude as hell and very selective with her customers. It's as if she gives good service to those who speak Arab and gives the absolute worst service to anyone otherwise. Like I said, I order my food here quite often. For example, my shish taouk would take 20 mins average to prepare. Last time I went there, she told the kitchen staff to give me the shish taouk that was already prepared long before my arrival in Arab. When I said that order wasn't for me, she said ok when I proceeded to wait for my usual 20 min order. What the hell.  Food: used to be delicious. Now the meat is bland and undergrilled. It lacks charcoal flavour and the pita wasn't even toasted to the usual crunchiness. They cheaped out on toppings and sauce as well. Huge disappointment coming from my Go-to food joint.  I give it a two star because I still haven't tried their deli market stuff."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to place for delicious halal meats. We drive from Brossard to get their amazing grillades. The filet mignon, kebabs, chicken breast skewers, etc,. are great to serve at dinner parties and if you're hungry while you wait, order their kebab, chicken or filet mignon sandwiches (I'm literally drooling just thinking about it) or plates. You can also get their pre-marinated meats to cook at home. Everything is delicious, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"It is sort of funny, the day we were supposed to leave for Montreal, the weird foods guy on the travel channel went here.  So I quickly found out how to find it and get there.  It was worth the trip.  But I'm also amused by why there isn't a line out the door!  It was on TV just a couple of days before we were there and it has great things.    After recovering from our confusion on how to order and pay (go to the counter with the nice ladies at it first) we decided to try the mixed plate.  Three kinds of grilled goodies, roasted veggies, onion and parsley salad, tomatoes, salty pickles, hummus and pita.  At about $14 for 1/2 kilo it is a good amount for two hungary tourists.  Although, when we ordered the woman ringing up our order thought we wanted 1 1/2 kilos and not 1/2 kilo.  When she asked for $44 I probably was a little pale but we soon worked it out.  We also got some tabule and drinks and made it out of there with a bunch of food.  Just a counter to east at, but across the street and down a bit was a great park to try out the grilled bits.  The kafka kebabs were very nice.  Not dried out like they often are, but could have used something.  The steak Kebab were excellent.  I would have either again.  The chicken, dried out but it is rare to get some that are not, the seasoning on them were good, but these just weren't up to the level the other two were.  The rest of the items were all very good, flavorful and yummy.  I wish I cold have tried other things and the butcher section looked amazing.  Another trip then.  We took the metro out to the last top and waked to Abu Elias and then found a bus back.  Worth a trip out and when public transit works to get there, what is stoping you?"}
{"text":"I had raw meat sandwich was great , and had grilled liver sandwich but wasn't good coz it wasn't lamb liver it was cow liver which makes the liver chewy and hard . The owner was very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Afternoon delight! Absolutely the best pita sandwich money can buy. The meat is BBQ'd over real charcoal then the sandwiches are prepared and toasted over the charcoal for a finishing touch. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. It's a must when I visit Montreal."}
{"text":"Ce diamant brut est à peine remarquable sur le coin de Boul. Côte-Vertu et Montpellier. Mais laissez-moi vous dire, votre première visite changeras votre vie! Boucherie libanaise à son meilleur, on peut y trouver toutes les spécialités imaginables et ils ont même un comptoir avec les meilleurs sandwich shish taouk, shawarma, falafels, et patates pour-emporter ou pour déguster sur place. Sans blagues, ça me rappel mon séjour au Liban à chaque fois. Et ce qui rend la place encore plus attrayante -- leurs prix! La qualité est vraiment présente et, ce, à prix vraiment abordables.   Petite note: au retour du travail, tout le monde arrête là pour aller faire les emplettes et le stationnement est assez difficile... Je suggère donc d'y aller vers 13-14h pour vous éviter le chiale."}
{"text":"Still have heartburn this morning after eating the mixed grill yesterday for dinner.  Twice as expensive ($38/kilo) and half as good as the place I usually go to several blocks west.  The \"filet\"  was tough, full of connective tissue.... I don't believe that this was real filet.... I could barely chew it and it stuck in my esophagus on the way down.   I gave it to my cat, but even feline teeth couldn't get through this and he just walked away from it.  The chicken and kafta were better, but not by much.  Overall, just tasteless and overpriced.  Cash only."}
{"text":"Abu Elias is excellent!!! If you are in Montreal take the metro to Cote Vertu and try this place!   We walked in and ordered 1.5 kilos of meat. This included pita, chicken and lamb kebobs and kofte kebab as well for $44. The meats are cooked in a charcoal grill so you must give it some time. We also ordered some hummus, onion salad, peppers and babagonoush for $7 dollars more. All in all this fed 4 people. Not bad at all!!!   Make sure to try to raw lamb tartare if you are brave!   They also sell frozen foods, such as feta cheese cigars, hummus, turkish looking dumplings.  The service is very good and they are willing to answer a lot of questions about their menu.  I knocked one star off because their dining area was a bit dirty."}
{"text":"We ordered a large catering selection for a company lunch and everything was so delicious that I was glad our boss warned us to bring tupperwares for the left overs. I can certainly see myself using this place as a \"cheat\" when I don't have time to prepare something for a potluck."}
{"text":"Best filet mignon  I  had in montreal so far for the price I paid  !! Yum party in my mouth I would definitely recommend it !! I wish I was leaving close to it so I can have their food more than once per month"}
{"text":"You must try this place for amazing Lebanese grilled meat sandwiches at an insanely cheap price that are definitely worth driving out of the city for.  There's a small parking lot for the place, and there's even a bathroom in the back that they'll let you use if needed.  When you walk in, there's a sort of market section with some prepared foods and refrigerated/frozen things (balkava, hummus, pitas, etc), and there's also a counter that's open to the kitchen.     We went around 11am, and they were just opening up.  A lot of locals who seemed to know the owners well came in and out picking up prepared items, but we were there for the grilled meat sandwiches.  Each is about $3-4 (US dollars), and it's stuffed with massive amounts of meat.  Many choices are available, and we went with one chicken and one filet mignon.  Both were so tender and flavorful, and they were perfectly balanced by the garlicky tahini and pungent parsley.  The outside lavash is also charred perfectly so that it's still soft but a bit crisp.  Everything was so fresh and flavorful, and I love how it's a lesser known family operated place.  This will be the first place I go to on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"OK, this place is awesome - BUT - you need to know what you are doing. My first time, I asked what to try and the people working there saw Indian guy and thought, \"no idea what he is doing\" so they suggest the shish taouk. Ok, so the shish taouk is good, but you are wasting your time if that is what you are getting here. This is a boucherie and they have some great great meats to explore. I took meats to cook at home and they made me Kefta fresh on my order. Did you hear that! Now if you have never had Kefta fresh to your BBQ .....it is mad.  Reason enough to go to Abu Elias. but there is so many great things to try. (They have a meat platter that you must try)"}
{"text":"This location isnt always in my route but when im not too far i make sure to do a quick pit stop :) i will buy some meat for my home and ofc a sandwich for the road. Their filet mignon is sonething else ! Straight from heaven. ..I find the employees nice, friendly and hard working! The only little downside if you are planning to buy big quantity of meat is that they do not accept credit cards !"}
{"text":"Delicious charcoal chicken, ordered their taboule salad and lamb sandwich. Everything was done very well, very flavourful and moist. Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"AMAZING food. The chicken was tender and full of flavor and the garlic sauce is amazing on their sandwiches. We had a feast and felt the prices were reasonable. We had the courage to try their calf brain sandwich (off menu item) and actually found it quite tasty. I can't wait to go back the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome mouth watering kabobs. The gyros are on the smaller side but every bite is freakishly awesome.  I'm based out in Boston, but it is places like these that make me seriously question why I'm not living in Montreal :)"}
{"text":"A combination Lebanese butcher's shop, grocery store, and grill that serves up some truly exceptional grilled meat sandwiches. Recommended: filet mignon, kafta (the best we've yet encountered in Montreal), and sojouk, a spicy homemade Armenian-Lebanese sausage. Ridiculously cheap, too. Get yours \"all-dressed.\"  Keep in mind that you can also order mixed-grill platters for larger groups.  Abu Elias is as informal as it gets, but these guys are royalty in the grilled meats department."}
{"text":"Best Shish Taouk sandwiches in town!!  Great choice of sandwiches.  Best to call in your order so you don't wait too long."}
{"text":"Get the kibbeh sandwich and brain sandwich. One of a kind, hard to find anywhere else and absolutely delicious. We also ordered the lamb over rice and kafta kebab. Both were excellent as well. The only hiccup was the language barrier- they didn't know English that well but it was fine as some smiles and explanations got the order correct. And was it ever worth it- amazing amazing place. Off the regular path getting to it but that's fine. Doesn't need to become a tourist trap and probably never will since it's unique in a way that tourist traps will never be. Salute!"}
