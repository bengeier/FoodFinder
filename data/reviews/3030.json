{"text":"3030 has young-professional written all over it. Craft beers, slightly pretentious menu and crowd, its Junction location (sigh, I remember the days when they avoided this area). And although I spend quite a bit of time in the neighbourhood, I only managed to getting around to checking it out a few days ago. That's mostly because it's a difficult place to notice, with an unassuming, simple '3030 stenciled on the front door, and not much else to identify it.  3030 is huge inside... seriously huge; especially for a place in The Junction. Stuffed full of small table settings and 2 full bars, it seems more like you're in a concert hall than a neighbourhood restaurant, and that's with good intention. 3030 is built to be a live music venue that doubles as a food-venue, and in my opinion, not the other way around (although that's what they go for in the off hours).  One thing's for sure, they put a lot of thought into their draft selection. The back bar has taps full of local-ish craft brews, including Wellington, Beaus, and even some other, more difficult one's to find, like the Junction Craft Brewing's IPA (which was fantastic), a Sawdust City stout, and a Broadhead White. Clearly, they take their beer selection very seriously. The unfortunate thing about the bars though is that with no stools to sit on, you get the distinct that they don't want you hanging out there.  Much like you'd expect from a place aimed at young-pros in The Junction (sigh), the atmosphere sets it up as a pretty cool place to hang out, with shelves full of board games and walls lined with old-school pinball machines and plenty of interesting art. With the retro pinball machines all lit up in the evening, it gives the perfect backdrop to a night out.  But with just a little '5 dollar snack menu' card on each table, you wonder what about those of us that were there for more than snacks. Our server haphazardly and unconfidently rattled off the items they serve (there was only 4 of them at the time) but not before having to go back to the kitchen a couple of times before she could get it right. I asked if the items changed daily, hence no menus and the difficulty remembering them, but nope, these items had been here for a while she said. While it's cool to try items out to see what works, I hope that eventually they'll put together a more permanent and more expansive menu, or at least one that changes seasonally.  Because none of their mains sounded appealing to us, we instead opted for the items on the snack menu. The Butter Chicken Wings, while mostly tasty with the typical strong flavours you'd expect, arrived lukewarm. The Potato Wedges on the other hand, were indescribably and inedibly  hot, which turned out to be ok because they were bland and tasteless anyways. Overall, we just didn't find any of the items on the snack menu impressive at all.  If you're in the neighbourhood, 3030 may be worth checking out, but I'd say solely for their draft selection; and although the fact that there isn't much like it in the neighbourhood makes it the kind of place you want to check out, I'd wait until there is a concert or show you want to see before making the trek. In my opinion, it just isn't worth going out of your way for.  With a Gabby's now opened next door, I remember feeling a little upset for them having competition so close from some evil, corporate chain, but really, it's of little consequence. It's obvious right away that they'll both be attracting very different types of people."}
{"text":"I haven't been on Yelp in forever but I had to come back to post this review because I had such a bad experience.  I really wanted to like this place so I went back several times, hoping it would get better, but every time it just got worse.    The last time I went for brunch, we waited over an hour and they hadn't even started cooking our food.  The server didn't even come by to ask us if we wanted anything to nibble on while we waited.  We ended up leaving because we were so starving we couldn't wait anymore.  That's the first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant because I was hungry!  The time before that, my husband asked for hot sauce and the server came back from the kitchen to tell us that the chef \"didn't feel like giving us any\".  I thought it was a joke.  She looked so embarrassed and I actually felt really bad for her.  We could see the bottle of hot sauce sitting there behind the counter... was it that difficult to pour some in a little cup?  The coffee they serve is President's Choice... maybe I'm a coffee snob but if I'm going out for brunch I'd like to have something that's a bit better quality.  The food is mediocre at best and definitely not worth waiting an hour and half.  The vibe they give off is that they don't really care whether you're there or not."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for some new place not too far from our hood (Parkdale) as we did not feel like standing in the pouring rain to try and get into Grand Electric. We found a decent review of this place in NOW's restaurant listing and I liked the look of the menu (being a foodie and all). I have read some of the reviews written below and I guess perhaps the kitchen has as well.   Note that the small \"tasting plates\" are $5 each so you should not expect to get a full meal out of one plate. We had the butter chicken wings with a mango chutney (somewhat spicy but I am a spice fanatic and this after all butter and not curry which is always a milder version in heat - and the chutney could have used a bit of sweetness in my mind) but the dish was overall very tasty. The in-house, cold smoked rainbow trout with salad was delicious. The crab cake was nice (my husband quite liked it - I though it was decent). The wedgie fries were salty but I do not mind salt on my fries. We also had the veal sweet breads. Although these were cooked nicely I could have taken or left this dish (was there truffle oil that I tasted in the salad?). I also ordered the braised beef cheeks with the cider pickled spaghetti squash - DELICIOUS. As for the beer selection, I had a wonderful Moroccan Dark Ale (not sold in any stores) and my husband had a local ale. We played some pinball on some 70's machines and that was great fun.   At the end of the day, we had six pints of micro brewed beer, five \"tasting\" dishes as well as one main dish. Our bill came to $92 before tip and I can tell you with the added bonus of playing some \"old school\" pinball this place lived up to its 5 \"N\"s in NOW magazine. Loved the wait staff, loved the atmosphere, food was decent and the final bill for all of this was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Was heading in here with high hopes after being fairly hungover on a Sunday. Wanted to try out the tapas menu as much as possible. Ordered the buttered chicken wings which I was most excited for. Probably the best thing I had but it was not anything special at all. I could make my own at home much better. They \"french\" the wings which really just means less food in this instance. Crab cake was not good at all, needed to be cooked a bit longer in my opinion, not flakey enough. Ordered the beef jerk rib which was terribly bland, it may have been a special. Ended up getting wedge fries at the end just to fill us up and they were good but nothing special again. Finished with a duck bun which was shredded kinda duck in a steamed bun. Look, every tapas spot is doing there own take on the whole steamed bun thing. I like them, but at this point its gunna have to be spectacular if your gunna run home about it. I would suggest it but ill be honest I wasn't impressed with this spot. Our waitress also seemed to have half a brain. She was young I get it but we had to ask for cutlery and she almost took my credit card away after paying and seemed generally weird. If she was stoned it would make a bit of sense not that I'm mad, I'd understand."}
{"text":"I visited this bar come-music -come games venue around a month ago. First off, the huge, warehouse feel to the front section with randomly scattered tables and chairs didn't feel a cosy or nice place to sit down for a meal...and then when I looked at the meal prices, my mind was made up  - so expensive!  The high cost continued with the whiskey I ordered: came to nearly $9 for a regular brand - and only 1oz too! Not cool in my books.  Service was fine - although it was pretty empty when we went.  The rear of the premises is set out for live music...it actually looks very nice! I haven't seen a band there, so I don't know about cover charges or sound quality..but I may venture back if i see a decent band listed there.  Overall, a pretty average place with above average prices."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside deceive you...the brick archway automatically gets bonus points for being different! It may look small on the outside (patio in front, with maybe 4 tables?) but they definitely make up for it inside. As soon as you walk in, your senses are heightened. Large chalkboards on the left display their menu which is an easy read, and simple. Then it's followed by the kitchen which is open concept (I believe I saw some prehistoric bones on the counter on display) Really neat! Followed by the bar then met with a grand stage. Plenty of seating. When I was there,  they had these vintage typewriters which you could actually use!! Super awesome! This place is Truly a Wonderland..you definitely won't be bored. Shelves of many different board games, VHS movies that you can pop into the VCR (remember those?) watch it on an old school tv. Couches included!! Okay..so I left the best  for last which is Vintage Pinball Machines!! For 25¢ a game, you can't go wrong!! On Tuesday's they have a Pinball Tournament along with a bring your own vinyl, if you wanna hear your own music! I found the people there,  very nice and friendly. I will promote this place to everyone I know just because of its \"Cool\" factor. Well done 3030!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Worst I've ever had in Toronto. Food was so gross i wanted to retch. Wouldn't eat here even if i was paid. Saw the owner briefly and he seemed like a right prick. I don't get how people like this place let alone give them any business.   Avoid."}
{"text":"I have just moved into the junction and heard that this is the place to go and yes it is. We ordered the small plates and they were so amazing we ordered again. Can't say enough about the food, thanks chef, service and board games....love it all"}
{"text":"Hard to believe all the bad reviews on here! 3030 is a GREAT bar in the Junction. Their $5 plates are delicious, and superb value - my wife and I will often get 6 or 7 and share them between us. Dinner for 2 for $30? Yes please! The beer selection is also great, and always rotating. Pinball machines are in good shape for the most part and there is always interesting bands coming in to play on the weekends. Staff is great and super friendly."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the small footprint.  This junction spot goes deep, it's HUGE.  Pinball, board games and a stage.    They have Operation--the boardgame.  The drunk surgeons butchering their patient, were clearly more awesome at surgery than I would have been.     The bar at the back is kept in check by one of the coolest cats this city has ever seen. Jeff is a trendy beer expert with an attitude!  If you're unsure what new beers you might like, get a sample.  Strong support for Canadian and Toronto breweries makes me proud to visit 3030 and support our country.  Live eclectic music, board games and pinball make this junction spot a great place to go with for a pint by myself or with friends."}
{"text":"Not busy but Took forever to get a beer. When the beer arrived, the server just turned and walked away without taking food order.  Finally  back to take order. Well the fries  took forever to arrive coming just as I finished the beer, so of course I had to order another. Also asked for vinegar for the fries.  Beer came. Finished second beer and fries just as the vinegar arrived. Not like I ate exceptionally fast. I was there for almost hour and a half. :-( Not sure I'm coming back any more."}
{"text":"Ok so I had some of the $5 snacks recently and they were quite yummy.  Had the beef carpaccio which I've never had before and it was delicious.  Also tried the pigtail torta which sounds weird but was actually amazing.  Almost like a fancier pulled pork sandwich.  This one was our favourite.  Huge servings too, so amazing value for only $5"}
{"text":"??????????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ??????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????  ?????????? ????????????????????????????????  ??????????????????1??????"}
{"text":"I have a severe nut allergy.  After trying the popcorn chicken, which obviously was covered in a nutty sauce or fried in nut oil, I had an extreme allergic reaction and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  The lack of menus made it impossible for me to know this beforehand.  If I had been a young child, I could be dead right now."}
{"text":"We love this bar and come here regularly for great beer   , food and sometimes live music.  Our favourites are the potato wedges, the beet salad and the mac and   cheese. There are always great craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Great place, bad food. Scamorza Mac sounds a lot better than it is: greasy Mac & cheese. Same with Shitakee pappardelle: tasteless pasta with a few bits of Shitakee. Fish tacos are suboptimal to say the least. Would not go back for food."}
{"text":"Awesome. Huge nice space, just starting brunches, kids friendly, 15 or so microbrews on tap...... it hits all the high points!"}
{"text":"The owner of this establishment is definitely confused about what type of business he/she is running.  Is this a entertainment bar, an upper class restaurant, a games room, or is it a cafeteria?   A group of 4 of us sat down, and after a while, realized that there was no wait staff. Fine, so the 2 ladies in our group went up to the bar, ordered 7 appetizer plates for 5 dollars each, and a round of drinks.  The food required prepayment, which was not what the atmosphere suggested.  After 30 seconds after ordering, a waitress brought over a dish that obviously was not ours, so we returned it.  Ten minutes later, one of my plates came out.  Being courteous to the other three people in my party, I waited for the rest of the food to arrive.  Well, 10 minutes later,  3 other dishes came out.   The last 3 dishes came out 45 minutes later, but not until the ladies complained about the wait!  It turns out that we were \"bumped\" because a large group of customers were in the actual dining area.  I was very annoyed by extended wait, but a wait staff did apologize and gave us all a round of shots on the house! That's the only reason why I an extra star!  The food was pretty decent, and very well presented, but the portions were so small that one would have to order 4-6 dishes to make a decent sized meal.  But if you're just going there for something to drink and something to nibble on, then the portions are just the right size."}
{"text":"The best bar in the Junction for craft beer, small plates, service and entertainment."}
{"text":"Just in time for Super Bowl Sunday, the 3030 has arisen like a Phoenix from the fire. It opened in Friday, 5 February 2016. Beer is good, VHS is playing. Seems to basically back to its former self."}
{"text":"While I've been here many times for live shows, I had never eaten here. Went for dinner and a band on St. Patrick's day. Appreciated that the staff and decor were not over the top into St. Patrick's day, no green beer! However, my food was kind of crap. I had the Monte Cristo with kale Caeser salad. The salad was severely lacking, the kale was supposed to be \"massaged\"? It was as tough as regular, not relaxed at all haha. There was nothing else in it. It tasted like kale with lemon, couldn't taste the anchovies in the dressing. The sandwich was open faced and average, it would be nice if the menu said it would be an open face sandwich. Though it may have, it was dark and reading the menu was difficult... I've had way better Monte Cristo sandwiches at run of the mill diners with much lower pricing.  My date had the meat tourtiere and thought it was excellent, though he was still hungry after and we ordered onion rings. There were four. Four onion rings on a plate. They tasted good and the ancho-chipotle dip that was smeared on the side of the plate tasted good as well.  While I will definitely go back for live shows, they have some excellent bands/acts play there, I don't think I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"OVER PRICED, Small portions on some foods!! A hipster hang-out with a lack of servicing staff cooperation. I like to see the chef/cooks while they cook but each time I've been here they seem snobby and have the couldn't be bothered attitude, mirrored by the servers. I thought maybe the disorganization of the staff would work itself out but, no. Have tried various things on the menu without getting excited. Pints are short poured and they could stand to pay more attention to the cleanliness of the dishes and cutlery. Ewww. Lipstick and various hardened gak!"}
{"text":"The place had a corporate event at the same time as our group of six. The dining room was pretty full. We had to wait almost two hours for all our meals to arrive and considering that they were all appetisers, it was unreasonable. We ordered tuna sashimi and it arrived an hour after it was ordered. When it arrived, it was maybe three small pieces of tuna and half a radish cut up with some watercress. It cost $9 but it was worth maybe fifty cents. When we asked to order more food, we were told we couldn't order more because they were too busy, but the food kept flowing to the corporate event. The bathrooms were in the back with the corporate function, and the waiter accused us of stealing food from the event's buffet table when we went to use them. That was the final straw, so we all paid and left. If I could give it a zero I would. When you run a restaurant, accusing your customers of stealing from another table and telling them they can't order isn't the way to stay in business long."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place if you want to kick back and enjoy some super-delish, casual eats, well-made cocktails and play a few games of vintage pinball. There's bands that play in the back room, as well, which is cool. And they also have an interesting selection of craft suds. I don't drink beer but my husband says it's great.  We were nervous when they closed up shop for a few months because we love this place, but fortunately they've reopened, this time with a few renos."}
{"text":"Avoid brunch at all costs unless you crave mediocre coffee and have two hours to kill. Eggs and toast shouldn't take over an hour to make, especially when the place isn't slammed. You are far better off going to another fine Junction establishment for Sunday breakfast. I hope they decide to read this and hire more staff to cook, because no one should have to wait that long for such simple food."}
{"text":"Wow!  I am stunned by the positive reviews.It looked good with about 20 beers on tap and an urban hipster, foodie kind of menu/feel. The place was busy at 8;30 on a Friday night. We ordered some drinks which came quickly. Unfortunately, we ended up waiting over 30 minutes for some fries and Mayo... tried to cancel the order and just got a lot of whining from the waitress whom I tried to hail for 10 of those minutes.( I eventually had to go and get her from wrapping napkins and cutlery.) Needless to say, I was still billed for the fries with no apology for the wait. I wonder how long I would have to wait for a whole meal!!  I tried to let my dissatisfaction known. No one seemed too interested. Therefore, I am writing a less than glowing review. Perhaps it is growing pains, as they are a newer establishment. I hope they make a better effort in the future with their customer service. I, for one, probably won't be going back and will not recommend it in the future. Sorry guys..."}
{"text":"Decent food, for brunch at least. I enjoyed the bibimbap and was impressed with the flavours. In the evening though when it is bar time, they do a very poor job of keeping their customers actually in the bar with their alcohol, many times I have seen customers in the street with wine and beer glasses in their hands, which is really no acceptable. If they put someone on the door at night, I will give them a better rating."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for food, drink (extensive, ever-changing craft list) and having a great time. Awesome for parents, since it's a larger joint (but respect that's a restaurant). Plus, they have regular family events - check FB for listings. If you're into live shows, there're few places in TO with a more consistent lineup of great bands."}
{"text":"ok so you have all reviewed the food and the Beer on Tap ( big deal, they have expensive beer on tap , what else is new )? -I haven't seen or  heard a word here about , OK one sentence \" two guys  attempting ...... background music .\"  So has anyone experienced some worth while live music at 3030."}
{"text":"A friend and I visited 3030 on a Monday night since we were in the junction area. Not only does this place serve food and alcohol, it also has an arcade, tons of seating and even a movie screening area at the back! I really liked the vibe with the exposed brick walls, chalkboard menu/event calendar, and spacious area. Menu had small plates and mains. The braised cheek and shank poutine had a delicious braising sauce gravy topped with succulent pork cheek. Definitely enough as a dinner! All in all, it seems like this place would be packed on a weekend night. I'll have to come back one day for some snacks and a movie night."}
{"text":"I picked this place for my partners birthday based on reviews but was unfortunately disappointed.  We got a few of the small plates: the Korean ribs are delicious and the lil crunch is really good. For the entrées, some of us got the lamb Burger,  I personally got the fish and chips along with another friend.  The dish was really disappointing and tasted like oil.  The batter was really bland. The lamb Burger was good.  The waiter did his best to rectify the situation.  He comped our drinks.  The person cleaning off our plates seemed really passed off at being there and was pretty rough with removing the plates.  The waiter was pretty absent minded.  In the middle of taking our order, he just ran off and came back a few minutes later.  Overall, it was an OK experience.  Probably will not be visiting again any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times, And each visit unfortunately it seemed to get worse.  Maybe I'm just hitting some off nights because I want to really like the place. The location, space, environment is nothing to complain about.  Cute decor, easy enough parking. Most of the complaints come around the service and food.... The first visit (a year ago) was great. Food was fantastic, service was attentive.  Because of that, I brought my sister there while she was In town visiting about 1 month later. she loved the trivia night, and the food was again very good, but the server this time wasn't very friendly or attentive (ok, maybe a bad night).  The last visit was about 2 weeks ago with her again. The service was \"ok\". Server was nice, but the place wasn't packed yet it still took a while to get attention. She didn't follow up on the food - my coke tasted like there was a chemical in it, the soup actually tasted good, but was cold because it was layered very thin in a large bowl, and The curry chicken wings were unfortunately just  Bad (sorry, but these should just be taken off the menu). it was really disappointing. The thing is, these things I'm could probably be easily fixed with just a little more attention from a server following up with the tables.  I'm sure we will give it another try because there were some great moments, I just hope it's better next time or may be time to give up."}
{"text":"Introduced to this establishment care of Craft Beer Passport, where the selections for craft beer are extensive. Service was just right - no one pressuring us to keep on ordering as the place wasn't busy (and it was just after lunch time). Tables, chairs and overall decor was unique, full of character, and I loved that each table had a different salt and pepper shaker. There is a garage door that opens out front to extend into a patio but it was super sunny and there isn't any shade in that area. I have to return again to experience it in the evening and for the food and cocktails, though. 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"I need to come here again.  I went a few weeks ago for drinks with a buddy and Ron Livingston and Sam Rockwell (and a whole slew of other celebrities) were at a movie party at the back.  Okay, so it was distracting but the room & ambiance is comfortable and the $5 snack menu was fantastic (the beef carpaccio was so good).    I'd like to check the real menu out sometime."}
{"text":"in case you don't want to read this, i'll summarize: terrible service.  it has been almost a month since i visited 3030 but the negative experience I had at this restaurant has compelled me to write.  We arrived early for breakfast, right as they opened.  we waited for friends so there was one  other table of people who ordered prior to us.   One hour after ordering our food (eggs & waffles) , we still had not been served.   We were very hungry by then but continued to wait.....  Finally, the waitress came with our children's food.  Strangely she remarked, \"Rush order for the kids\", your food will be here shortly... (we still did not complain).....well, the kids ate, got bored, played about 9 games of pin ball, we were still waiting and waiting, and waiting for our eggs....things had gotten RIDICULOUS.  I finally expressed to the waitress that our food was taking way too long.  She retaliated rudely that we would just have to wait. She also mentioned that they use special cooking techniques which take longer than other restaurants.  We are talking about eggs people!!  I later complained to another waiter who also became rude and aggressive with us.  It was truly unbelievable to us.  We were in shock.    I have been brunching with friends for about 22 years.  This was a) the longest I've EVER waited for food  and b) the worst treatment I've ever received from staff.   note that the staff treated us very nicely until we complained.  so in case you are willing to wait over 1.5 hours for eggs without inquiring as to  where you food might be, even if you are the only people in the restaurant, you might like it here."}
{"text":"I've been to 3030 countless times now and have never had a disappointing experience. Their snack menu is a steal with most items costing $5, which is amazing given the quality of the food. The pigtail torta and blue cheese mac and cheese are a must have, as well as the potato wedges. Now you might be thinking to yourself, \"Potato wedges? Really?\" YES REALLY! They have elevated the humble spud to a thing of beauty. They're perfectly cooked and plentiful, which helps to soak up the delicious cocktails that you will be drinking all night. The only place that I've had similar tasting wedges is at Pravda Vodka Bar, and there you will be paying twice as much for half of the amount of wedges. If you have a chance, check out one their kitchen battles, where they invite local chefs to battle against their own for a delicious and inventive one night only menu."}
{"text":"I've been here with friends several times now, it's a really cool spot, unique and fun! the food is great, and so many craft beers to choose from!  I'm planning a big group get together this month and will definitely choose this spot for it!!  the pinball machines are a bonus!!"}
{"text":"Almost everything was overtly salty. Plates were small for the price. Service was ok. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Just prior to Christmas I visited 3030 with some friends for dinner just prior to a Christmas party we were attending later that evening. I'd heard rumblings of this Junction mainstay across the Yelpiverse and was tickled pink when I heard that this was where I'd be dining this evening.  The decor of this place is very laid back with a certain retro sheen to it (namely because of the 1970's living room set up as soon as you walk in). Aside from that its a pretty unassuming place, great stage set up towards the back for live music, a simple bar to the left. Cool place!  Their beer selection was awesome with many varieties I'd not had (or not had in awhile), I opted for something new and I found myself guzzling down a pint of the Hops and Robbers IPA. It was interesting as it had the IPA hoppy finish with a touch of a fruity beginning. Very different and on my list of faves.  Before I get into the menu items we partook allow me to shed some light on a couple of points. First, they have 2 menu's, one is exclusively for their appetizers (all of which are $5) as well as a menu for their entrees. Secondly, there is a curtain about 1/2 way across the restaurant which is pulled off to the side and it's purpose is to separate the full menu side of the restaurant from the appetizer only side. We literally were the first seat on the wrong side of the curtain and the server wasn't going to serve us entrees - lucky for us the head chef and owner were sitting next to us and pulled some strings to have us served. Bonus!!! Thanks again!  The following was shared amongst 3 diners, we all left stuffed!  Appetizers   Mixed Mushroom Tart - $5 (x2 orders) - Light and fluffy tart base (just a little crispy) covered with a mix of mushrooms lightly sauteed and seasoned. LOVED IT!  Butter Chicken Wings - $5 (x2 orders) - Served 4-6 @ a time, these were cooked and sauced in a way that made me salivate more with each bite. Cooked perfectly and covered in butter chicken curry sauce. I literally licked the plate clean!  Field Tomato Salad - $5 - Huge field tomato, green and red, sliced horizontally and done with a mix of what I believe was balsamic reductions and goat cheese mixed in at each level. A generous portion and very fresh on the taste buds.  Crab Cake - $5 - Light and crispy, not over cooked (hate it when that happens). Not overwhelmingly battered or crabby. Another winner.  Entrees Beef Cheeks - $18 - My first time ever trying beef cheeks and so I wasn't sure what to expect. So tender and cooked/seasoned beautifully. This dish did not last long! MUST ORDER!  Tagliatelle - $18 - Flat Italian egg noodles tossed with a symphony of mixed mushrooms. The portion size was crazy generous and more than one person could comfortably finish on their own. Loved it - so happy when non italian restaurants can pull of italian cooking perfectly   Compliments to the chef - he was a super nice guy and his menu was amazing. This is a great spot to come with a group of friends and just dine right off the appetizer menu.   I can't wait to come back here again!!"}
{"text":"The service was crazy slow. It took over an hour and a half hour for an small dish.  If you're going at night for the front room, I'd check what's going on in the back. The two spaces are separated by a curtain that provides no sound barrier.  The food was poor. The crab salad had scraps of breading with almost no meet. The dressing bland. The mini BLT had very little in it.  The server was never seemed to be around. It took him 10 minutes of fumbling trying to enter my 2 item bill before he asked for help.   The night I was there, people couldn't get drink. A tip: if you get stuck there, go to the bar in the back to order yourself a drink.   If I decide to go to an event there in future, I will not order food. The kitchen seems arrogant and incompetent.   The female manager I tried to speak to about my concerns seemed completely clueless about what was going in in the restaurant and how to respond to me asking why the food service was so slow. She just looked at me blankly.   I walked away furious that they were so wasteful of my time. I feel for the person who booked the place for our group. A frequent topic was just how slow it was. If you make a reservation for a large group, don't expect there will be staff.   This place has a hipster style but lacks substance."}
{"text":"Food was good,  a bit pricey for portions but good nonetheless. Service was a bit slow at first and cold but picked up and got better throughout the stay. Love the venue and vintage items and accessories (pinball!)  I'll come back because the beer selection is excellent and the 5$ snacks are pretty good."}
{"text":"Overall Rating: 3 Stars Food Rating: 1 Star Atmosphere: 3.5 Stars Beer: 4 Stars  I like the concept of 3030 and appreciate their focus on craft beers. When I ordered a beer at the bar, they encouraged me to try a few samples to see what I liked best. The place has a comfortable environment with games  and pinball machines. Unfortunately, the food was a real disappointment. I was here with a party of four and I think everyone was disappointed.   Here's the good:  - Great local beer menu. I enjoyed a Hop's and Robbers and a Great Lakes Audrey Hopburn.  - Service was good and efficient. Although there was a busboy who was incredibly eager to clear our table (rather annoying).  - Cool, comfortable atmosphere. This is a cool local neighborhood pub. Even free games to play. Mixed crowd - everyone fits in!  And the bad:  - The Tapas menu was a huge disappointment. I tried 3 items: 1) The wings - although there was a modest spice and butter sauce, overall flavour was bland, 2) The sweat bread - One word, Salty and 3) Mushroom Tart - I absolutely love mushrooms but this dish just lacked any real flavour again.    All in all, this nets to a 2.5 - 3 star experience.   Note: There is live independent music in the evening. I personally didn't enjoy the music but will exclude from the overall rating as music is just too subjective. Live music could be a plus or minus depending on your personal tastes. If you want a quiet place, you may want to select a pub without live music. Compared to other live music pubs, I didn't find the music incredibly loud or overly distracting.  BK"}
{"text":"Unique place! The $5 snacks are delicious but weren't hot when they come out. Big space with pinball machines which always makes me happy . Will be back!"}
{"text":"Large selection of beers on tap, small plates that fill you up (but not your tab), and lots of neat pinball machines... Very cool place! It's quite busy so go early on prime nights. I was disappointed that a small group was hogging the cheapest pinball machine (Star Wars). That one was a quarter while the other surrounding ones were a dollar... A bit steep for one game of pinball.  After a drink and some small plates (enough that we were full and satisfied), our bill was surprisingly cheap! That's definitely a win. I was a bit disappointed in the food though. The fried chicken sandwich was amazing, but the sauce on the butter chicken wings didn't remind me of butter chicken at all, and the seafood dish was a bit dry and burnt on the edges. But I feel like once you learn the best items to order on the menu, this would be a great bar to spend an evening."}
{"text":"I don't get the reviews on this restaurant! this place is consistently good.  The bison lasagna is the best!"}
{"text":"We went to 3030 in search of a light lunch, on a Friday.  When we went in there was a dazzling array of food choices listed on a board near the entrance.  Encouraged, we found a table and sat.  A friendly waiter gave us a menu.  The items listed on the menu were completely different to those shown on the board, and sadly, did not include the Caesar Salad shown on the board.  Most of the choices, including pancakes, were not light.  I said I would prefer the Caesar Salad. The waiter explained that those items on the board were not available for todays' lunch.  I asked if he could recommend something light on the menu he had given us, and the best he could suggest was the Tomato Salad.  My husband ordered the eggs Benedict and I ordered the Tomato Salad.  After what seemed like an eternity, but was actually a mere 30 minutes, the nice waiter arrived triumphantly with our food.  I have to give them 100 percent for the excellent presentation. The plates looked amazing, with great care being taken with the food arrangement.   My husband was very pleased with his Eggs Benedict.  I was crashingly disappointed with my tomato salad.  What I got was a magnificantly sliced tomato, interlaced with paper thin slices of onion, and sprinkled with Blue Cheese. A work of art. It looked just a like whole tomato.  I really appreciate the skill that went in to slicing and arranging the tomato and onion, and how great it looked, but to me that was not a tomato salad.  That was it - basically one tomato sliced with onion and blue cheese. No roll, bun, slice of bread, no other vegetables. I was not pleased and was left hungry.  For the life of me, I cannot see why it took 30 minutes to prep those two dishes.  Probably mean to judge them on that one experience, but you may be sure I won't be rushing back there any time soon for lunch. (sigh)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere (pinball machines and board games), very friendly staff, excellent beer selection but the food was nothing special (not bad but not amazing).  Go with a group of people and if you're going to go for a board game I would suggest Clue or Apples to Apples."}
{"text":"i cant believe this place got such low reviews. I love the ambience. The music. Asked the chef for something spicy and he recommended oxtail bapimbap. NEver had it before. Sunday brunch menu. Was so delish!!! great drink menu!! Good service. Really enjoyed myself. Was pricey but definately worth it."}
{"text":"This place - which has terrific food, pinball machines and a great draft/craft beer selection - gets only one star? Why? Because every time we go there, the customer service experience is nothing short of a baffling ordeal. Every time.   Bless her heart...the slightly goth-y, hair piled into a top-knot, crop-topped, pear-shaped waitress with black jeans who always works the weekend brunch shift is in the wrong line of work. She should do beta testing for the newest model of iphone, because trust me, THAT's her true passion. Yes, we're all interested in our phones, but sometimes, when we're at work, and there's actual work to be done, it's not feasible to be tapping on them constantly.  Walk in to the 3030 for brunch, grab a table and it will take at least 10 minutes for goth-y cell phone to even notice you. It helps to be super smiley and engage her vision directly. She'll eventually bring you menus, but only menus. She's not hanging around at your table any longer to see if you want a cup of coffee or a cocktail. She just wants to go back behind the bar to see what's going on with her phone, and she wants to do it as quickly as possible. Maybe someone snapchatted something in the past minute. She wouldn't want to fall behind, would she?  Wait another 20 minutes, or, if you're feeling brazen, walk up to the bar and say politely \"um...we're ready to order now...\", and then she'll take your order. Coffee will arrive 15-20 minutes later, and 45 minutes after the coffee comes, the food will finally appear. Within this entire process, the only sense of urgency you will experience is the desperate need this waitress has to return to her phone, regardless of how busy it is, or how many customers appear to be noticeably impatient or confused by the service. It's like a science fiction narrative is evolving in front of you where this waitress is somehow controlled by a futuristic silver hand-held obelisk and she will DIE if she moves too far away from it."}
{"text":"The food is great and place is urban cool. I tried the brunch menu - interesting Louisiana dish called Grits, recommended by server. It is savory and sweet at the same time with string fries. It was fun and different ! I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"My manfriend and I have recently discovered The Junction, and love the cute quirkiness and great little shops and cafes in the area.    One late morning, we decided to head to the area for brunch.  Unfortunately, my favourite place with great cakes was busy, and we were hungry, so we headed back eastward where I saw a sign that said \"Serving Brunch!\" or something to that extent.  As we walked in, both our sets of eyes were taken aback - this place is huge!  We were greeted by friendly staff and promptly seated, and without a wait.  Quite honestly, it wasn't busy at all...but the larger table by the garage-door opening was already taken.  Pinball machines?!  How cool is this place?  And do I see a pile of board games?  What's going on ALL the way back there?  A stage?  We were impressed by the VENUE, friendly SERVICE, and great FOOD!  I've been there twice now for brunch, and neither of us have been anything less than happily satisfied with their coffee, latte, oxtail omelette, wild-mushroom omelette, duck confit sandwich, corned-beef eggs benedict, and basket of bread (banana bread, cornbread, and baguette)!  We haven't yet made it to an evening here, but this will be on the timeline.  Originally, it was going to be 4 stars, but due to the friendly service, which I will give credit to the owner/manager for ensuring it exists, 5 STARS and a HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for a long time and 3030 was been a huge break for us. The bar options in the area have always lacked and until a few years ago the only break we got is when The Troubadour opened up, which closed maybe a year or two later.  When The Troubadour closed we were left with the few bars we'd always had (but I never found them worth the effort in trying to like). Fast forward the few years it took for the owners of 3030 to renovate and build 3030 and the Junction has a night life.  3030 brings not only an excellent food menu and the most appropriate beer menu possible for The Junction (The beers are all local and independent), but 3030 also gives you a reason to go out. It seems like almost every night 3030 has some sort of scheduled event, theme, or performance. From Whisky tastings to trivia nights, to games nights, to live music, there's always a reason to visit 3030.  The quality of the beer and food should be made again, the $5 appetizer plates they serve are often super tasty and indulgent. It's worth limiting yourself and not trying to eat more than two appetizers per visit. They have a bit of a rotation on the food they serve just like they do on their beers. 3030 is one of only two bars in The Junction to serve cask ale (along with Hole in the Wall).  The staff at 3030 took my friend's order incorrectly one night, and after waiting for 30 minutes we found out that his order never appeared on the menu. He got some beer on the house and had both the chef and a waitress come up and apologize to him. To me that's an appropriate recompense.  My one \"tip\" is that if they are playing music, it gets really loud at the back making conversation impossible, so sit at the front of the bar.  If you are only visiting the Junction, you owe it to yourself to visit 3030."}
{"text":"Came back for dinner and drinks on a lazy Sunday afternoon. There's not a lot of patios on the strip, so the big garage door that opens is as close as you can get.   I found the food here better than brunch for sure. At $5 for small plates, that could only be shared by max 3 people is nice, but found them not as original or fresh as it could be. We got the Pigtail Torta (pigtail sandwich between two puff pastries), Mushroom Tart (a little cold, as if it was reheated), Fries (big wedge fries with homemade mayo). Note: I'm just speculating.  As for mains, $12-20 we got the boar and mushroom parpadelle which was made the way I like my creamy pasta (cream +mushroomy). However, it was so spicy which overpowered the boar and mushroom taste. I mentioned it to the server as feedback who really didn't do anything about it.   In the back curtained off area was a live band playing which was nice for music. $25 cover to get in, not sure about that unless you're a fan of the actual band that was playing. Noticed the crowd was some trendy older folk and families so this might be the place to be.   They have some vintage old boardgames which was a nice diversion. And one of the pinball machines kept giving us free games.  Service was okay, the table was wobbly and kept spilling our drinks. Nothing was really done about it, nor did we press on about it either.   May or may not come back. I really want to like it here, and I would suggest it again especially with a group.  We took a walk to Hole In the Wall - where the food is better priced and a lot more appetizing. But then you have the atmosphere factor. Could be nice on a colder day."}
{"text":"3030 is confused; the atmosphere would suggest it is a local, down to earth watering hole however the menu screams \"trendy gastropub,\" this place is definitely better at being the former rather than the latter.   A group of 4 of us came to 3030 on Friday night and the place was pretty full. For the atmosphere I give this place 4 stars. 3030 has a down to earth feel, the kind of place you can hang out with friends for hours drinking and chatting. The space is pretty large and doubles as a music venue with a small stage towards the back. On this night they had 2 guys doing their best to play some background music. I absolutely loved the pinball machines near the entrance; it gave the place a retro feel. There is also a shelf full of board games for those who want to have some group fun, yet another awesome feature of this place. The beer menu was pretty good and consisted of a variety of local craft beers; this is always a plus for me.   Despite the good atmosphere the menu failed to impress, I give it a generous 2 stars. The group of us ordered 3 dishes off the $5 tapas menu. The veal sweetbreads were disappointing, they tasted of nothing but salt and the portion size was laughable, just 4 really small pieces of meat. The mushroom tart which should have been easy to execute was depressing, the mushrooms were dry and bland, the only taste I could pick up was a hint of thyme and the phyllo it was served on was clumpy, another miss. The butter chicken wings were the best of the 3 but that is not saying much, these were 3 drumsticks (why not serve the whole wing?) that were surprisingly bland for an Indian inspired dish. All in all the food was disappointing and IMO didn't match the atmosphere of the bar. I think a simple tapas menu more conducive to sharing would be much better.  The service was pretty good, our waitress checked up on us regularly but table service in the bar area stopped after 11pm which was fine except for the fact that one eager bus boy kept trying to clear our table. Overall I think 3030 is a nice neighbourhood bar to grab some drinks but I would recommend you skip the food."}
{"text":"We needed to wait 40 min for our daughter to be groomed, we decided to have brunch at 3030.  The premises are open, wide, with plenty of space, nice decoration, low lighting, a simple breakfast menu, mimosas, and other interesting cocktails (although the menu says they are serve from 10-3, law says at 11).  There were 2 more tables in the premises, however, it took more than 40 minutes for our eggs to be cooked... A breakfast place that needs 40 min to fix an egg bagel and two sunny side eggs, with no ppl is in real trouble (I can't get over it... We ordered at 10:22 and at 11:05 a mimosa on da house was offered... No thanks! We are starving and amuse by your incompetence).  We got the call to pick our kid, so we needed to order the eggs to go... Lame!   We arrived home feeling dumb while eating our almost cold take out. At least the containers are recyclable ($30 flushed on the toilet, and our eggs at the fridge screaming us suckers).  I don't know if I would go back, maybe just for drinks... Nah, to my black list."}
{"text":"Their small plates are pretty delicious (especially the gourmet \"Mac 'n Cheese\") and the service is friendly and efficient. The venue is huge, so it's fairly easy to get a table. This is a great addition to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch got the steak and eggs as well as the hash.  Cool vibe and they got pinball machines for a quarter per play!"}
{"text":"The 3030 has quickly become my go to destination in the Junction (Serious hat tip to Hole in the Wall, that place is excellent too). The first thing you will notice when you enter the 3030 is that there is SPACE. This isn't your typical sardine-packed Dundas bar and you are not going to have to grind through a sea of people to get a drink. Sorry annonymous gropers, it's back to Red Light for you. You may have to wait to get a table but there is ample room in the back, and a second bar, so you don't need to lurk over peoples tables while they eat. Better still, pump some quarters in to the pinball machines while you wait.   They few shows I have seen the acoustics have been OK. It's a large concrete box so you have to work with what you got, and they do a decent job. You will see the sound guy moving about the room checking levels. Gotta appreciate the effort.   Pretty well rounded beer selection and the few small dishes I have ordered were pretty tasty, arrived promptly to the correct table (WHAAAAT), and were well priced. Most notable were the double w/ pork belly & Blue Mac & Cheese. I've read alot of complaints about the service, and personally can't speak to that. My experiences have always been pleasant. Sadly, It's not your servers fault it's January outside.   If the menu doesn't tickle your fancy there's a pizzeria down the road called Little Caesers that does a pretzel crust pizza. :-o  The future is NOW."}
{"text":"Large space. Not bad bar stock and walk-up service at the back room bar was friendly enough and efficient.  Unfortunately, the management doesn't seem to care about the place. One easily spotted symptom is that 3 of their 5(!) pinball machines were turned off when went there for an old friend's bday celebration last Thursday. The remaining two pinballs were on... so, being a lover of pinball and a fan of pinball-focused TO establishments like TILT, I inserted (as stated on the machine) a quarter (thinking fondly about the last time arcade games were a quarter; and there was no obstruction over the coin slot, so all should be good, right?) and nothing happened. I couldn't start the game. So I ask at the counter and I'm told oh- they don't work. No explanation as to when or if even the machines will be fixed. No apology. Not even a half-hearted \"sorry\" for my lost quarter (it's the sentiment that counts even though a quarter is worth 'nothing' these days). Huh? To make it more aggravating, there are cards under the pinball glass that say something about pinball tournaments on these machines and reference a pinball tournaments Facebook page.  It's lame to take up so much space with FIVE pinball machines as the visual Crown Jewels in the bar.. and have them fall into disrepair (if they ever worked at all); useless and non-functional."}

{"text":"It's so close to being great but at this stage, it's just \"OK\".   Great: wide beer selection, large open space, long bar, music venue, and $5 gourmet snacks (including crab cakes and curried chicken wings).  The service was sub-par. It's hard to tell who works here because the staff blends with the patrons in an annoying way (plaid shirts, beards, grumpiness....do you work here?). The bartender took my $5 food order, gave me my beer, then walked away so I walked back to my seat. Then he stomps over angrily and asks me to pay. Well, ok, I was going to pay but you walked away! Confusion. My second complaint is with the overzealous bus boy who swiped my ($9) bourbon shot (that I had been sipping slowly) without realizing that half of it was still in the glass! I had to go to the bar and ask for a new one. Sigh. Unnecessarily annoying.    If they improve their service quality, they could be a real gem in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 as a venue and its beer menu.  Its a very cool building with good vibes and neat art. As a restaurant, I did feel admittedly underwhelmed by the food which is why the final ranking sits at a 3 on the Yelp scale.  The menu has lots of appealing options, but none impressed. From best to worst: Popcorn Chicken = winner of the night, best thing we tried. Baba Ghanoush with Plantain Chips = decent, this would be a great thing to nibble on over drinks. Plate O Bacon = decent, as it was simply bacon with maple syrup drizzled over it. would be hard to get that wrong. Butter Chicken Wings = tiny wings that flavour wise did not remind me of butter chicken Lamb Lollipop = a single bone from a rack of lamb, that was light on meatyness and was overcooked and dry Double with Pork Belly = too much chickpea, not enough flavour  One thing that also displeasing is that there were 2 different sources of music, meaning that anyone sitting near the curtain dividing off the 2 halfs of the room would have to deal with competing and clashing sounds. I think I was the only one to notice but it did bug me til I had enough pints to focus my attention on the food.  So that said, this is a cool place to go in the Junction without question if looking for a place to grab drinks and chat or go for the live music/djs. I'd just skip on going their for an actual meal."}
{"text":"From the front, it is deceptively big.  It reminds me of Bier Mrkt on Esplanade.    Beer selection is very good - has my favourite draft beer there!    Was very clean, and the service was great.  I will definitely return whenever I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Cool little spot.  Lots of beers on tap.   Live music which is always fun.  Lots of hipsters too (you know if they're in the house something cool is going on LOL).  I would go back."}
{"text":"Everyone should go once to this unique place, though once may be enough.   Located at the opposite end of the Junction hood from Hole in the Wall, it's also it's opposite in the fact that it's gigantic, and the servers are much friendlier - tho I think HitW's servers suffer from being over-busy.   Food - just okay, despite the big blackboard's descriptive appeal.  Tapas plates.  I've probably had about 10 or so and never have I thought any dish more than just 'okay'.   My favourite meals here have been the two brunches I've had. You choose it a la carte and it features the best bacon ever!  Beer- outstanding selection of local - always several I've never even heard of, let alone tried.   Very funky interior is divided into 3 areas - front: couchy loungy with old tv playing old shows; middle- restaurant tables with entertaining old ads under shellacked topping, and 5 old pinball machines; back- large space with stage and big bar.    Somehow I've never felt any part of this space to be very inviting, but that may just be me, and full credit to them for daring such a large space and doing some interesting things with it.    It's worth keeping in mind, for instance, the Gabby's bar right beside it, and how well it stacks up against the likes of that."}
{"text":"Want to get a drink, some interesting food and play some games - all in one night?  Well then just come here for a low key kinda night.  We decided to hit this place up as we were already in the area after visiting some friends.  The service is lovely and we ordered a bunch of the small plates plus the bison burger to share.  We tried the butter chicken wings, the mackeral, the beef carpaccio, korean shot ribs as the small plate.  Each were delicious - but small.  Which is why we ordered the bison burger...lol.  The beer menu is interesting and the vibe is definitely laid back.  I wouldn't drive all the way up here for this place but if I'm in the area I wouldn't mind popping in for a quick bite and a game :)"}
{"text":"We were here on the Toronto Craft Beer Passport event in 2016 and weren't terribly impressed but this year - wow - their food menu has improved. I had the Veal Cheeks - amazingly succulent - with the best corn bread I have ever had anywhere. The sides were a perfect pairing and that's the comment I sent back to the chef - a perfect plate. My spouse was less impressed with his charcuterie which seemed spare - even if the components were yummy.  All in, I recommend this Beer Bistro highly."}
{"text":"A great place to hang out with a group of friends.  We had some tapas from the $5 menu and many beers.  The Mill St Pumpkin Ale is delicious.  The food is nothing special, but I am definitely a fan of this place.  Friendliest servers ever.  A bookshelf filled with boardgames.  Plenty of great beer.  We had a few and then played Clue and Apples to Apples (a great game for the slightly inebriated)."}
{"text":"A big, oddly shaped bar with a few pinball machines and a good selection of craft beers. Went on a Friday night with a few friends and it wasn't super busy. They played good music though."}
{"text":"First time here last night! They were accommodating for a group of 3. The waiter was very attentive. The small plates were good portion sizes. We had the salmon with focaccia, chicken and waffles, blue cheese Mac and cheese (sooo creamy) and the Korean BBQ ribs (a few more ribs would be nice)! Drinks-wise I had the peach cider which was tasty. My party had the Sam Roberts, Conductor and the Hawaiian brew which were all pretty light and refreshing. I like how spacious the place is but the place soon filled up for the live band, The Intentions. They were killing it on the stage with soul and Motown tunes. Would come back again."}
{"text":"3030: Definition: Hipsters gathering in a loud warehouse like space cum restaurant/bar.    I didn't try the food, so I can't comment on that, but I can talk bout the DRINKS.  They write on their website that they have \"sixteen taps all dedicated exclusively to selling the best and most interesting Ontario Craft Beers.\"  Umm...not so much.  I only found 1 beer on this list interesting.  Nothing else stood out as interesting.  Their cocktail programs seems to be in development.  They had some special cocktails listed, but none that I really wanted to order.  I saw a bottle of St. Germain and asked for a cocktail with that and gin like a fizz.  I got an Elderflower collins that was overly diluted with soda water and ice.  Pours are super-strictly regimented....I wasn't even sure if the jigger was full.    The SERVICE was OK.  Bar staff were fairly friendly.  No table service at all.  Not sure how I would have ordered food here.    We enjoyed the ambiance of the space and the music.  That is, until the super-hipster DJ took over and the music got 3 times as loud and 10 times worse.  We got tired of shouting at each other and left.  Maybe it's fun with a live band?"}
{"text":"3030 is one of a limited number of bar options in the Junction.  It manages to draw a large crowd for its space, but is not the best in the area. On my most recent visit, the beer was warm and the service was lousy.  While the service is typically lousy, the beer is not usually warm.  Here are some key points...  1. The place is a large space.  On the left side as you walk in, there is a bar, while a little further back beyond the restrooms, there is a back bar.  The front bar has a few beers and is mainly for food, where the back bar handles most of the cocktails.  On the right side of the place there is a bank of old pinball machines and board games that you can bring to a table.  2. You order your drink at the bar, then find a seat (if you can.)  There are about 12 beers on tap here.      3. The crowd here is almost entirely Caucasian between the ages of 28 and 32.  It is not really a hipster crowd, but more of a young professional crowd.  4. The place is best for meeting a group of friends, not for parties of two or one.  Most people arrive as a group of four or more.  If you observe, you will notice (especially on busy nights) that couples will often turn around and walk out because it is loud, there are few tables, and the service is not inviting.  It is a loud and festive atmosphere. Even louder when they have live music playing on the stage in the back.  5. The prices for cocktails are a bit high and the pours are small.  6. The food is OK.  The best bet is to opt for the later evening \"snacks\" that run around $5.  The main meals are good enough, but the atmosphere may not lend itself to a $20-$30 entree.  In conclusion, if you are not picky about service and you come with a group of friends within the age demographic, you will be fine with this place."}
{"text":"Occasion: Birthday.  Service: Horrible. We kept asking for water, didn't get it. We also had other requests, didn't get any whatsoever done. Our server kept ignoring our table, even though it was not even busy.   Food: For what's it worth, don't go. The food came out cold. The portions, it's okay, I mean it's decent. The quality of the food, you're better off going to Starbucks or some fast food chain for something a lot better. Also the pricing for the food, not worth it at all. All the plates we ordered, none stood out."}
{"text":"Well, let me start by saying my expectations weren't overly high to begin with so it should have been easy to impress, or at least, not to disappoint.  Secondly, perhaps I would be able to give a higher rating if we had had the chance to eat more than one duck bun in the 1hour and 20 minutes we sat there.   Sadly we did not, even though we had ordered our dishes shortly after sitting down.   I don't mind slow service if there is a reason for it. What I don't understand, and have little patience for, is flippant, dismissive service.        More on that later.  Let's review the one piece of food we were able to eat.   The steamed buns which are suppose to be their signature item.    Duck Steamed Buns - have these people ever eaten a steamed a bun?  Ever? Once? In their whole lives?   My guess is no.  Steamed buns are meant to be soft and delicate.   This was more like  duck stuck between a stale pita.   To be fair, the duck had some flavour. Some.   When I asked if they had any siracha  I was told their kitchen was too busy and we would have it eventually.  (seriously? It is hot sauce)  At an hour and 20 minutes in we asked our waiter to cancel the rest of the order and bring us the bill.     She brought the bill however everything we had ordered (yet not received) was on the bill.   She then explained that she could not take the items off because they were already being prepared,  to which I almost laughed out loud.    Long saga ensued with the manager where he and I went back and forth about us paying for what we ordered vs us paying for what we received, two drinks and one app, and close to 10 minutes later I won.       It is important to note that this dialog occurred right in the dinning room in front of other customers.    Luckily there were only a few other customers actually in the place so not very many people had to hear the crap these guys were trying to pull.    Lucky for 3030.  Not so lucky for us though, was that the fire alarm was going off all night.      I would give this 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Really cool place in the Junction. Went for a friend's birthday and tried their 3030 burger. The cook and taste on the burger patty was excellent! Good appetizers too and a decent selection of beers.  They've also got some retro pinball machines that are fun to play and a stage for live music. My only complaint is that I wish they kept the kitchen open past 11 pm as my friends were still hungry for a late night snack."}
{"text":"This is my fail safe spot, for sure...   When ever your stuck and you don't feel like having the 'same ol' same ol'  you gotta hit up 30/30.   They got everything for anybody; fantastic food, great pin ball, boardgames and an old couch area where you can see movies on a black and white TV..  To be honest, it kind of reminds my of my uncle's old house growing up, this hits it home for me..  Well done."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on writing a bad review because I understand how hard it is for small businesses. But after reading some of the responses on Google Review from the owner themselves to the 1 star rating reviews, I felt like the owners clearly does not care about their reputation so why should I.   First off, the service. The service was okay at best. One thing that irk me was our server. She was taking my friends order but decided it was okay to walk away mid-way to attend another table to take their orders. Overall, she seemed very flustered even though the place was not busy at all. During our dinner, the server grabbed our water when it was not empty but no worries... however she never brought it back until we asked.   Food. Yes owner. I know your food is under $20 and a Big Mac is $9 and you're unsure how much cheaper you can price your menu. But I think the individuals complaining about the price of the food is not so much on the cost but what they got for the price they paid. For example, my Fried Chicken funnel cake was $17. $17 didn't seem so bad until I tasted my food. It was flavourless and most important, COLD.  But I love how you're comparing your \"Restaurant\" to a FAST FOOD CHAIN. I am glad we can both agree that your food is very much like what I can get at a fast food place. The difference is, at least when I get my food from fast food places, it's HOT and does not cost me $20. & the response about how blogto and published critics gave you good reviews.. yes I've looked. And it seems like those posts are from 2014 & 2016. And the only food related reviews is for your wings and pigtail torta. Like your response to one of your negative review \"It's unfair to review an entire menu based on your opinion of one appetizer.\" It's also unfair to say your food is good solidly from a good review on ONLY TWO items on your menu. Also, its 2017, please show some recent REAL food critics reviews and not rely on some fam you had 4 years ago on Toronto Life & Post City.    Yes, I am telling the internet about my experience. I am hoping that they can learn from my mistake because it does not seem like the business is learning or willing to fix anything or even worth supporting. Not a surprise given that you can't take criticism. A good business should be willing to accept fault and own up to it. Your response to your negative reviews showed no such thing. No apologies and very defensive."}
{"text":"Looks like a really fun place but there is nothing there for me to eat, 99% of what they offer is meat/dairy/egg-based... I was there for a couple of birthdays and asked the chef to help me out a tiny bit with not pouring liquid egg and butter all over my vegetarian (dumplings?), he gave me a dirty look and ignored me completely.. alrighty then, I can spend my $$ somewhere else. I just don't feel like struggling with a bland salad or fries while drinking beer.  Too bad, if they offered a couple of vegan options, I'd be there every weekend."}
{"text":"Hosted a 40 guest 30th birthday party here for my boyfriend. The manager (Jameson) was very helpful. He helped me put together an appetizer selection that catered to all kinds of dietary restrictions; vegans, vegetarians, nut allergy, shellfish allergy, no pork, and even an egg allergy. And despite telling him my budget he stuck to what was realistic and said that we could always add more items as the party went on. He only used half of my budget which was very honest and greatly appreciated!   They allowed us to bring in our own deserts (cake and cupcakes) and one of the bartender's (Lucas) even created a customized drink menu based on the birthday boy's favourite drinks and personality.   We have come here several other times and have never been disappointed (big or small party size). The food is very unique and delicious. Appetizers and mains are both averagely priced.    The entertainment is fun (we have been here on music nights, game nights and vendor nights). With or without cover we have never regretted coming here.   Have even come here for dinner with three 11 year old kids to eat and while waiting we played on their vintage pinball machines and with their fun array of board games! Careful with Jenga - do not play once the food arrives!"}
{"text":"The good: large space, good for gatherings.   That's about it. Oh wait not true, the blue cheese Mac n cheese is divine and the wedges.   Bar service is ridiculously slow. Towards 9pm, they try to shut down the first bar closer to the entrance. To encourage people to order from the second. Where there is only one bartender. It's painfully stupid. Poor management.   Yeah will not return again. Sad, because they don't care.   We ordered: beef, chicken wings, Mac n cheese , BBQ ribs and wedges.  Butter chicken wings were poorly made. It tasted like someone dumped pc butter chicken sauce on it.   Pretty disgusting for someone who is a food snob. Was it edible? Yes. Did we get ill? No.   Was it worth it? No."}
{"text":"Key Feature: Had Flying Monkey Orange Mungus beer on tap in the summer  If money is not a concern, raise the rating by 2 stars.  So, this is a nice place.  It's really pretty inside.  They have good food.  But - and here it is - it's not cheap.  This isn't Bloor West.  This is the junction.  This is a place where I should be able to grab a beer for 5 or 6 bucks.  When I'm dropping dropping the same price on a pint here, that I could pay for a pitcher down at College and Bathurst, it could be said that something just might be wrong.  Again - though - this is a trendy place.    Just don't hope to host an event here.  Friend of mine wanted to have her birthday here, and soak up the environment, but they wouldn't let her reserve an area for 15 people.  Now, maybe, this is understandable if the people looking to make reservations are flaky 19 year olds.  But when you have grown up adults, looking to have a thirtieth birthday, you'd think a venue would want to encourage that.  Sadly - not so much.    So - end of the day, great beer on tap, and great food - also a great location, and a great vibe.  The only thing is, you're really paying for it."}
{"text":"Ohhhh 3030, where to begin? This place is just so well rounded. Staff is great, and the place is almost always busy.   1) the brunch is on point. One of the ladies, Emily, who runs the brunch show is super attentive and friendly. When taking the payment at the end, she sat down and chatted with me for a bit. Some people might not like that, but for me I loved it - it fosters a connection with your clientele. I worked in the food and beverage industry for a long time, and I have particular expectations from the server/ staff.   2) the food overall is bomb - hats off to Aditza (the head chef and now GM)   3) pinball machines and games available   4) great drink selection   5) LIVE MUSIC - like Motown bands and DJ's. I threw a surprise birthday party there in 2014 and they were exceptionally accommodating, and the music made the experience even better!   6) sometimes there's a line to get in, but it moves relatively quick. Also, there's almost never any cover.   Overall, this would be the place the head to with pals if you want to be in the Junction. Always a good time!"}
{"text":"My new place to go. I'm SO VERY HAPPY to have this bar opened a few blocks from home, I needed that!   #1 The ambiance: They're BIG! Whether you want to sit on the balcony, on their AWESOME COUCHES or inside, on a table, you'll be fine. Right now I feel the couch (OMG I love them), in front of the BW TV is my favourite, especially during the day. Last sunday they had Raiders of The Lost Ark playing. It was that cool!   #2 Food: Their menu is not very veggie-friendly, which upsets me a bit. I don't eat red meat/pork and avoid deep fried things, so I couldn't enjoy most of their food. I had, though, very good Gravlax and a fruit tart with blue cheese ice cream which were THE BEST. I hope they improve, as they work with tapas and that's quite easy to change.   #3 Drinks: Here it comes: their bartenders are fantastic. I tried going there for the first time recommended by my favourite bartender, Vince,  who works there a couple days a week, and then met Josh. Wasn't disappointed at all. Josh made a citrusy martini for me which is now my default drink, if you wanna try, ask for \"the citrus martini you made for Renata\", but he can make everything you ask. Also, ask Vince for recommendations. Vince is my friend! :D   #4 Beers: I'm not a beer enthusiast, so I'm skipping this. I've heard the Junction Conductor Ale is great.   Conclusion: Take your friends, take your dates, take everyone there. Such a great place!"}
{"text":"I visited 3030 a couple of times with a beer lovers Social Group several years ago; both visits were at night and were the first times I visited there.  As it's a live music venue, there were performances by bands both nights and I recall the acts being quite good.  I didn't make it back there again until several years later - NYE 2016 -'17 - when a friend and Ii stopped by to briefly check their beer menu.  We didn't stay for drinks that night but I've made several more visits there with 1 or 2 friends since then, therefore I think it's about time I gave the venue a review.  3030 is not considered to be a really large venue although I view it as being somewhat spacious given that it's located in The Junction and I definitely don't consider it to be small.  The stage is at the very back, there are 2 bars on the left side of the venue, 1 of which is further back, closer to the stage.  There is lounge seating at the very front, some pinball machines close to the front and a couple other pinball machines in the back to the right of the stage which either weren't working or weren't turned on when I was last there.  Their regular tables are quite 'decorative' and a variety of paintings adorn their exposed brick wall on the right.  The venue used to have a 'small bites' menu which replaced their dinner menu at 8 pm (at least on certain nights).  I'm not sure if they still have the small bites menu but I recall ordering wedge fries and popcorn chicken from that menu the 1st couple of times I visited and those items were quite good.  I haven't yet had a full meal at 3030 but almost every time I've been I've had at least 1 beer there and their selection is always great: pretty extensive and quite varied in terms of styles.  The last few times I've visited has been for drinks only either mid to late afternoon or earlier in the evening when the venue has been fairly barren therefore the service, as expected, was quite prompt.  I don't recall really slow service the 1st couple of times I was there when it was later in the evening and pretty packed; that was years ago but hopefully that hasn't changed.  I wouldn't consider 3030 an upscale venue but definitely worth a visit if you're in the area, have never been and want to partake in some great beverages (beers) and/or maybe some quality food; if you can make it there at night for a live performance, well there's a 3rd option for you too."}
{"text":"First to Review! We had every single thing on the menu, so I can tell you all about it! (because let's face it, the secret about this place is already getting out). It's billing itself as primarily a performance venue and where you pick up your food at the bar instead of a full fledge \"restaurant.\" That said, I'm a huge fan of the food here and I think it's going to be a huge factor in its success.  VIBE  3030 which is its address (3030 Dundas St. W) is in the heart and centre of The Junction.Firstly, there's no big sign. Look for the numbers above the door. Secondly, the place is HUGE.    I liken 3030 to a hipster's Chuck E Cheese. You've got this 70s living room vibe, complete with old school television set not working, retro furniture and vinyl playing on the soundtracks. Local art changes on the regular (and the place has only been open for two weeks!); the tables are all lacquered with interesting newsprint items or funny ads, sayings or pictures (I've seen this at The Painted Lady) and there's a stage for performances. Oh, and of course they have pinball machines and board games! That night, they were setting up for a knitting club. Already, I can hear the pitter patter of converses and mismatched socks flocking here.   But hold onto your skinny jeans, there's more!  WE ATE/DRANK Since my friend has already been here about 6 times, he knows the staff and they greeted us with a beer tasting (they know me, they really know me). They have different beers on tap (organic and local, of course) including a Mill Street blueberry concoction. I wasn't a super fan and I usually am with Mill St. I had a few tastings of Amsterdam before settling on the sweet St. Ambroise apricot beer. Now you know what I get when I can't get Heineken. I was pretty much shunned from ordering a Gin and Tonic.   The great thing about this is that already an alum of Grand Electric is head chef here and the owners have pretty much given him the reign and said create what you want. And innovative snack food is what he has put forth to the Junction. Sing to the heavens!   I won't go into every dish. I will tell you what we really enjoyed. And PS each dish is $5. $5!!!   - the butter chicken wings; delectable; saucy and comes with all the right side sauces. Yes, you will be addicted.  -the popcorn chicken was my personal favourite. The sauce hit the mark!  -the fries were really really good. And that mayo chipotle sauce. Have you caught on that I'm a fan of sauce? Quite saucy, non?  -Dining companion loved the prawn fritters.  -the Pork shoulder gyoza was omg delish!  -Hogs in a quilt are basically like pigs in a blanket but with house made sausage and a fantastic mustard sauce that has quite the kick. Not a big fan of overpowering mustard but this stuff can get addictive.  -cilantro and potato wontons with a creamy croquette --this was the special. Note; everything as piping hot but it's all flavour flavour flavour.   The menu's going to change and of course being part of the Hoof trajectory means there's going to be some adventurous meat options on the menu. A brunch is also coming up and guess what? You'll probably get a seat because the place is huge.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Start parking your BMX outside early because this is the new it-spot and you're going to see a lot of plaid hovering outside of here. All jokes aside, you can tell the staff are really passionate about bringing something new and fresh and in an emerging neighbourhood that was kind of stagnating in the nightlife department (and it's also not the size of Carrie Bradshaw's closet). To that, I give them two butter chicken wings up.   Here's the Blog TO review: http://www.blogto.com/bars/3030-dundas-west-toronto"}
{"text":"This is a difficult rating for me, but I think I just about pegged it. 3030 was touted to me as a place to visit by a beer geek friend. She hadn't gone yet, but she had heard good things. I was in the High Park area and heading North, so I decided to stop in and have a quick drink to assess the place before we came back at a later date.  After finding parking I started looking for this place and thankfully I knew the address because the signage is horrible. If that's intentional and their aiming to be the kind of place only those in the know are able to visit, that's a mistake. When I entered, right at lunchtime, the HUGE place had only two people. I don't imagine they'll get too many walk-ins.  Because of the empty cavernous feel, I had the awkward feeling that they weren't open and my hesitancy was noticed by someone who nervously asked me what I wanted. Uh, yeah, I actually had to ask this guy if they were open...and they were. I told him that I was just in for one drink and he seemed disappointed. This isn't a good start to my experience. He then pointed around to the empty place and said...\"sit anywhere\". Sure, buddy, I'll just do that...I took a seat beside the other people as close to the door as possible.  Because of the recommendation, I expected an awesome beer menu, but was disappointed with the 12 taps they had on offer. Most were decent Ontario craft brews, but there were no standouts. Disappointed might be too strong a word, I'd happily drink here, but it's not going to be an outright destination for the evening.  I was heading to lunch, so I didn't eat, but the menu looks ambitious and reasonably priced. It seems so varied, that I'm not sure that  I'd return here some day for lunch or for their $5 tapas menu. I've always wanted to try 'provisions' before, but haven't had the chance. I'm not sure this is the place to get it authentically though."}
{"text":"I'm pretty hesitant to give out full-on 5 star ratings for anywhere, but 3030 was pretty damn close.   When you walk up to the front door it looks like a narrow little storefront, but when you walk inside it feels like the coziest airplane hanger around. This place is HUGE!! They also seem to host an eclectic variety of events, but I have yet to catch them... they usually begin around 10:00pm to keep the dinner crowd happy.   The beer list is ever-changing, massive and delicious. Ask for a taster if you don't know if you will enjoy something and they will happily oblige. A nice cocktail list also exists, although when you look at the chalkboard of rotating taps, it is tough to get past a cold frosty one.   The food that I have had is delicious, especially the prime rib. Probably the best I have ever had, and I know my Alberta beef AND my way around cooking meat. I have also tried a number of the small plates and have never been disappointed.   For me, 3030 is a great way to start an evening off if you are in the Junction area. Great, friendly staff and an open kitchen creates a real vibe. And to do that in a mini aircraft hangar is pretty impressive!"}
{"text":"Its a pretty cool place to hang out. We got the butter chicken wings which were tiny as hell, not worth even the $5.00, and we got this goat in rice balls.  We also had a beet salad which was flavourless.  Cool place to hang.  Food we had wasnt so great.  Nice workers. Pinball machines gave us issues."}
{"text":"When we first moved into the area, there were very few options for bars/restaurants in the Junction 'hood.  So I was excited to check out 3030 after reading a review back in the fall of 2012.  We came in on a busy Friday night.  The back half of this large place was curtained off for a cabaret show ($10 cover) so we decided to grab a seat on the other side of the curtain.  A friendly staff member was quick to help us find a table and explain the ordering scenario.    We were to place food/drink orders at the bar and then it would be delivered to our table.  We had the options of starting a tab or paying upfront.    As beer enthusiasts, we eyed the impressive local draught menu and ordered two pints of beers we had never tried - Sawdust City's Skinny Dipping Stout and Broadhead's Long Shot White ($7.50 each).  Also grabbed 3 tapas to go with the beers - popcorn chicken, beef carpaccio and potato wedges ($5 each).  Beers came quickly to the table with the tapas following not too long after.  Popcorn chicken was somewhat disappointing as it was 4-5 small pieces of breaded chicken.  Beef carpaccio was 4 small pieces and potato wedges came in a bowl with a nice dipping sauce.  Tapas dishes were a bit on the salty side, if not only to encourage more drinking.  I love 3030 in my 'hood - the large space is impressive.  Their ever changing local draught menu is enough to keep me coming back on a regular basis and I hope we can catch some live music there next time."}
{"text":"For years (since it opened) we've been going to 3030 with our kids. I've brought umpteen families there, introduced a plethora of people to this family friendly Junction hotspot, celebrated birthdays, etc. etc. always kids running around, playing pinball and board games and having an all around blast. It was a great place to go to. We were always gone by 9pm - before the bands came on - and the staff was warm and welcoming... Until tonight.   Tonight, as usual, the bar and wait staff were kind and warm but one female staff member was cold... Beyond cold. It started when 2 of the 6 kids went up on stage. As their parents were already starting to shuffle them off, this staff member coldly said \"they can't be on the stage\". Completely understand but a little warmth would be a better approach. Then, as the kids danced around... On the dance floor... One of them walked around the table and hit her head on a sheet music stand. My wife started to move the stand aside and that same, cold woman grabbed it and put it back exactly where it was. That's when things got really cold.   \"Why are you here with kids. This is a bar.\"  We'll, we're here with kids because we're always here with kids. And we're here because it's also a restaurant. Where we eat. Often. Are you serious right now?  \"Well they shouldn't be running around.\"  They're not running around, they're dancing, they're just not that good. That's how kids dance. On the dancer floor. And they're significantly less rowdy than the Friday, long weekend crowd that will surely and shortly follow.   This woman, unbeknownst to her, then went to each staff member at the front trying to have someone kick us out. How do I know? Because my friend's wife was there ordering a drink as she went to at least 2 people and asked them to remove us... All because kids were dancing on the dance floor. Imagine that.   Got the owner, Jeff, involved. What did he do? Nothing. No apology. Nothing.   Sorry Jeff, we may have a mutual friend but that's the last dollar that you'll see from my pocket or from any of the many families that I know in the Junction. You may have a restaurant... Sorry, bar... here but I live here and my kids go to school here. As I've done with all of the local businesses, I have supported you for years. Unfortunately, your first chance to support me came and went without a peep from you.   Such a shame. We both lost tonight."}
{"text":"My friend who lives in the area took me here and honestly one of the best places to relax and/or party.  From outside it looks pretty quiet and small, but once you walk in, its large and deep (giggity). 2 bars on the left side and tons of tables on the right. My friend told me it wasn't packed that night, but seemed very busy to me. They were playing reggae/soca and hip hop that night, and I enjoy that.  We didn't stay more than a 2 hours, more was just there for a beer. But I enjoyed the people dancing and the atmosphere. I definitely want to go back and dance one night"}
{"text":"I've been to 3030 quite a few times and have mixed feelings about it. I really want to like it but on certain visits it has been a letdown. I think it's a great place to go for some good beers and a laid back atmosphere (depending on the night's entertainment).   My favorite part is they always have about 15 Ontario craft beers on tap. There is always a great selection no matter what kind of beer you like. I really like this because sometimes a bar can focus on one type of beer which makes it tough when your group has different preferences.  The tapas menu is a bit hit or miss. Pulled pork sandwich is great but I've also had some disappointments mainly around the portion size. You'll want to order food before you're hungry because it can take some time for them to prepare. Although in my last few visits they have been much faster.  I have also tried their brunch which wasn't great. We arrived for a late brunch and were hungry and ready to eat. We put in our orders and then waited over an hour for our food! We were so hungry we ordered the bread plate after 30 minutes of waiting to help tide us over. The bread plate even took 10-15 minutes to get to our table. The food was pretty good but after waiting so long we couldn't enjoy them no matter how good the food was.  3030 is a great spot to grab a few drinks and a little snack but I won't be back for the brunch considering all the other great options in the area."}
{"text":"Vastly over rated.  I went with three friends last night.  We were sat near the entrance that was mostly always open and continuously gusting a heavy -20 at us and some lightly sweatered hipsteress kept standing with the door open to smoke ironically.  So we kept out coats on to stay warm.   We asked if once another table opened up if they could let us know and we'd move, our overly pretentious waiter just said something along the lines of \"too bad for you, you should have come earlier\".   Whatever, fair enough.  Next, we were rushed to order beverages by said pretentious waiter who got snotty after I asked him what beer he had, he pointed to a giant wall of beer.  I asked him about a specific beer, he said it was an IPA, I asked him what the IBU (bitterness units), he snapped it was an IPA.  I'm a beer wuss so I don't like them bitter.  So I order something else.   We then selected our meals and sat back, bundled while sipping our craft beers.   Food wise, it was pretty good, not the best I've had ever, but better than a chain restaurant.  On our table, two of us ordered some tapas, so ribs, chicken on a waffle and blue cheese mac and cheese.  These were excellent.  I ordered the butter nut squash and beet ravioli soaked in butter; they were very tasty but a little on the small portion size... as in the tapas were larger.    The fourth person ordered their Callalloo soup... that never came.   We waited for about five minutes for the Callalloo but as the arctic cold front kept moving across our table, we decided to eat the food before it was completely cold expecting the fourth person's meal shortly.  We finished eating in about 20 minutes, then they cleared the table and still no Callalloo.  We tried cancelled the meat because we wound up sharing our food and the forth person didn't want to eat alone.  The waiter, who hasn't liked us from the start, just said \"well, it should be out any minute now.  It takes longer to make.\"  We figured that the now 20+ minutes after we received ours (30-35 miuntes after we placed the order) was long enough.  We also suspected he forgot to place the order and didn't fess up.  His next response was wholly uncalled for \"Well if you don't want it anymore, that's okay, I'll just come from my pay.  It's okay.  I'll pay for you.\"  We of course said no, but he quickly left our table.  Then a new person came to clear some of our glasses and I asked for a second beer.  He said sure.  Then the original waiter came back and said that he heard I wanted a second beer, I said yes please.  Then he left.  He came back about 5 minutes later with the bill and put it on the table, then looked at me and asked \"Oh, did you still want another beer?\"  The tone, however, was a clear \"pay and leave\".    So I declined and we decided to pay and leave.   The waiter stood over us trying to rush our sorting of the bill and suggested on several occasions within the whole 4 minutes that he could go separate the bill.   Our original intent was to make a night of it by having dinner then move to the back to dance and drink.  Instead we left the restaurant and went to a really awesome place called \"The Hole in the Wall\" just a bit down the road.  The forth person got to order food and eat, we had some beers and listened to the live band.  It was such a better experience."}
{"text":"I sadly give this place two stars because of the kitchen. The bar is cool and seems like a great music venue. I haven't been here for a show, I've only been for brunch.  I went on a Saturday that wasn't busy, and waited for over an hour for two eggs, toast and potatoes. They have an open kitchen, and the cook was blasting obnoxious caribbean music that seemed to get louder as we continued to wait.  The portions were small and sad. I will not be returning for food, but maybe for a pint and a show."}
{"text":"The power of social media.. Top 10 new restaurants? All these 5 star reviews on Yelp?  Maybe I just have too high of expectation with 3030.  It is definitely a really cool neighbourhood joint with a decent selection of beer from local breweries ($7-$7.50). I can see myself having a drink or 2 here with my friends and chill a little.   Tapas for $5, I am IN.. but the ones we ordered Veal Sweet Breads, Mixed Mushroom Tart and Butter Chicken Wings were all bad. Breads so salty, Tart  so sweet, Wings so bland.. Everything is off..   At 3030, no one knows what's going on.. What time the kitchen closes? 12 am, 11:00 pm.. then ended up it really closes at 10:30?   No table services after 11 pm at the lounge area, which is ok with me, as I can get my drinks at the bar. Just this guy kept coming over and trying to clean our table every couple of minutes: napkins, almost finished glass, not really finished glass..  Live performance with no covers.. great to promote live music..but not good if you just want to chit chat with your friends over a draft or 2!  I just wish 3030 is better. I doubt I will be rushing back.. and definitely won't be rushing back here for their food!"}
{"text":"I've been a Junction resident for years and I'm always excited for new restaurants in the area so I tried 3030. There's a great selection of beer and the atmosphere is energetic but confusing. The patron is responsible for ordering food and drinks at the bar and then picking up the drinks at an entirely different section of the bar. The food, when finally arrived, was bland, overpriced and undercooked. I ordered a grilled salmon that was basically sushi and when I asked the waitress to have it cooked more I watched the cook tell her \"No\". The $25 I paid for undercooked salmon and bland risotto will prevent me from ever going back to 3030. The chef's pretentious, rude and inflexible behaviour isn't in keeping with the Junction's relaxed and friendly vibe. I really hope this isn't what the Junction is turning into: high price, \"fad\" restaurants. This place is more concerned with subpar food at elevated prices with rude service...not a recipe for a successful restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing venue space for parties. Don't let the front facade fool you, it's super big on the inside.  I just helf my fiancé's 30th there, and it was a blast. The food was reasonably priced, and delicious, and they had a stage and sound system for our obligatory slide show and awkward speeches.  Summary: huge venue space, great food, access to stage and music, strong downtown location."}
{"text":"Lots of great beers on tap, a Chef that is passionate about food and pays attention to the details, and a great venue for live music or a chilled night out with friends. My only regret is not having my camera so that I could have taken pictures of the candy like carpaccio, crispy wings that tasted like I was eating a spicy margarita, and simple but delightful mushroom tart I ate. And at $5/plate!!!"}
{"text":"Great venue/pub. Despite looking small from the outside, the place is actually quite big. Really good for groups. It has cool vibe, with art on the wall, and pinball machines on the side."}
{"text":"The small plates are small but delicious.  Everything we tried was fresh and prepared with care.    My wife's bitters salad was dressed appropriately and had a nice variety of greens.  Her blue cheese macaroni made her exclaim \"I'd come back here just for this. \"  My bison burger was fantastic and juicy. My wife's virgin Caesar was very spicy, just the way she likes it.  My High Park Brewery IPA was perfectly hoppy.  The server was delightful and very chipper. The decor was welcoming.   We really enjoyed everything about our visit including the very enjoyable show put on by The Intentions."}
{"text":"Came down to chill and play some pinball.  Then we had some delicious Items from the menu.  Must must have the Pigtail Torta...signature original dish.
