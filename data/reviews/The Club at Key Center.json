{"text":"I was a member of the Club for some time, appreciated its convenient location and friendly desk staff. The Club pretends/aspires to be a center for networking, fostering a close community of professionals. It is ultimately, however, a narrow-minded and exclusively self-interested corporation with poor customer service sensibilities. I had my wallet stolen during a 30 second interval of lapsed vigilance, in the locker room by an employee the night before a 2-week business trip in Europe, which I had to undertake with no credit cards. The Club refused to take even the smallest measures to compensate me, and seemed at every turn to only be concerned with not being sued (either by me or the employee, who was fired \"for other reasons\"). The gym is convenient, but the facilities very poor, dirty, moldy, many broken machines, cardio equipment covered in sweat, with lights often out and water dripping from the ceiling nearly more days than not over the winter. At nearly $200 a month I expected more and was severely disappointed. If you want to take a risk you'll have to lower your expectations and keep an eye on your belongings at ALL TIMES!"}
{"text":"Great place for parties.  Good food.  Nice club.  They always remember my name"}
{"text":"Great place for networking events and large gatherings.  A little hard to find if you've never been there before but once you do find it the views, the helpful staff and the atmosphere is worth it.  Looking forward to the next event here1"}
{"text":"The Club at Key Center offeres two key things I was looking for in downtown Cleveland.  They have a wonderful workout facility with great staff and kind clientele, and they offer the social aspect I was looking for in a City Club.  The Pub upstairs is wonderful place to grab a quick bite, or drinks after work - and the dining room serves as a great place to have a more formal dinner or to entertain.    In terms of the social aspect, we frequent the cooking glasses, 3,4,5 meal specials in the pub, wine tastings, special events and networking happy hrs.    The athletic floor has plenty of machines, free weights, pool, classes (yoga, zumba, spin ... etc) - and spacious locker room facilities.    This is a membership based facility, but they tend to run special promotions for young professionals."}
{"text":"This is a private membership club. At the moment there are varied pricing schemes based on age (discounts given to young professionals/under 30y/o: $150 initiation; $106/month). Young professionals get an automatic free upgrade in membership level allowing access to all the 14 other Northeast OH clubs (a monthly $32 value) and a free small (too small to fit a gym bag) gym locker with laundry service (a monthly value of $12 [large locker $22]). All members get free parking (unlimited after 1700 weekdays; 2hrs during the workday) in the Memorial Plaza Garage at all times whether using the club or not. There are no food/bev minimums which is nice and often rare in such clubs.   Fitness/3rd flr. I love the fitness center. It is smaller than the gym I have previously gone to, but is never busy so it being smaller isn't an issue. There is a hot tub and sauna in the locker rooms as well as a seating area (couches and TVs). The locker rooms also offer free shoe shine service and laundry service (if you have a paid locker - you can use a locker daily for free or pay to have a permanent one). There are new cardio machines with individual TVs, a studio for free classes (e.g., spinning, yoga, core, zumba, pilates, etc) & a weight area. The weight area has older equipment, but it is clean and in good condition and works fine. The equipment age is not an issue for me here - there are places with newer machines but these work perfectly. They offer a larger than average selection based on the benchmark average of downtown CLE gyms. There is one set of dumbbells (sizes like 17.5 & 22.5 not included), decline/flat/incline benches, barbells, ez-bars (in increments of 10lbs) & one cable tower & 1 smith machine. In the studio are kettle bells, med/Swiss balls and other balance and stretching equiptment. There is also a 25m pool w/ great views of Public Square.   The 4th floor has the social and food aspects of the club. There is a pub lounge, a formal restaurant (with great views of The Mall) sporting a baby grand piano, and meeting rooms that can be reserved for free. They serve brekkie 0700-0900, lunch 1130-1400, and dinner 1730-2100. The pub is open during and between lunch and dinner. Closed (except for fitness) Sat & Sund. I had Easter brunch here and my family who I took as guests absolutely loved it. The morning breakfast is also a great value offering fresh fruit, eggs and oatmeal just to name a few buffet options.   It's a great club in general offering interesting events each week. Great benefits at this location & across the club network. Give the membership adviser, Greg, a call & schedule yourself a tour."}
