{"text":"So, this place has gone downhill, sliding on a luge and carrying a hand basket . Just got served by a grumpy old lady that muttered expletives under her breath, when I told her I couldn't have dairy after she loaded up my plate with Tzatziki without asking if I wanted it. She scraped it off, but yeah, couldn't eat anything she put on that side of the plate and I was leery of asking her for a new one because she looked like she was going to lose her shit. 

She also basically gave me a heaping tablespoon's worth of two salads, like it's wartime and beets are being rationed by the Province. And reheated old falafels, instead of before, when they were made fresh (and basically was the entire appeal of this place). And gave me bread without asking. I can't have gluten, so I couldn't eat that side of the plate either. 

Two tablespoons of salad, a sea of insipid hummus and old falafels. All this for $11.50? And half the plate has been rendered inedible? And your grump face looming, ruining my appetite? No thanks. I'd rather eat at the Superstore Deli. Which has BETTER falafel."}
{"text":"We come to the Farmers Market quite frequently. I've always walked by Baba's Kitchen but today decided to try their Chicken Shawarma. The lady was friendly but the $9 price tag was not. When I saw her take the wrap out of the fridge and place it on the grill I should have known. After one bite I was gagging. It looked and tasted like dog food. I love chicken shawarma but this was no where near anything I've ever eaten. Steer clear people! This place is a joke. Never again!"}
