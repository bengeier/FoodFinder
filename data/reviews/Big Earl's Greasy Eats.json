{"text":"Hamburger was ok kind of over priced for what you get. Chicken fingers looked and tasted like store bought frozen strips. The fries and shake were good, although I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"One of the BEST burgers I have ever eaten. Quick and easy, good service. I ordered a garden burger, blackened, and cajun fries. Not a ton of vegetarian options, but that burger is worth the trip there. My friends got a grilled cheese, Big Kahuna burger, and a Big Earls burger. They all said it was one of the best burgers they've had."}
{"text":"If you love great service, fun coworkers and the best burgers and \"calzone sandwiches\" in the area,, Big Earls is the place!  I was up to visit my parents and we needed to eat lunch before an event.  My dad called in the order before we got there. 10 minutes later, Brooke, the best and vivacious burger attendant , saw us walk in and said \"You guys are the phone order !\" We were sitting down to eat, enjoying Brooke's sassy conversation and laughing the whole time.  Great vibes from the music, service and decor.  Food was excellent - recommend this spot highly in your visit to Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Big Earl's has quickly become a favorite of mine when visiting the Cave Creek and Carefree area. When you first arrive you'll notice the great 1950's style sign welcoming you to Big Earl's and it is a preview of what you'll get inside. Unpretentious, simple but delicious food. All American options like burgers, onion rings, and chicken sandwiches are done perfectly. My favorite defiantly being the Big Kahuna Chicken Sandwich (you can also get the burger version) which features a Soy Sauce combo dressing and a pineapple on a chicken sandwich...amazing. Top it off with a Rootbeer float and youve got a meal made in heaven. If floats arent for you there are dozens of diverse and interesting beers to pair with your meal. You can sit inside getting an old diner feel or outside and stay cool on their roadside patio under the misters and people watch.  Defiantly worth the drive no matter where you are located."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. Great service with a smile. Downing the burger and onion rings with a beer, can't go wrong. If you're in cave creek check it out, it's a must for me if I am in town."}
{"text":"I recently ate there and really the burger was pretty good, but what ruined it was the girl that was taking the orders behind the counter, handling the money and then going out and Smoking  a Cigarette between taking orders right outside the door where everyone could see her and then coming back in and serving  the food without washing her hands. It was noticed by several others. She also had a friend \"Boy\" hanging out at the counter visiting while we were there and he wasn't eating just taking up a spot. It was distasteful to say the least. I'm sure the Health Dept would shut it down if they witness this."}
{"text":"A real joint! Price of burgers were a tad high. If it came with a large picked it would've been 5 stars! Patty melt was outstanding! Volleyball was a bonus."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast, and best burgers, in Phoenix. Wonderful service, food served quickly, and great people working there. I highly recommend Big Earl's! One of Phoenix's true hidden gems, don't pass it by."}
{"text":"Good burgers and sweet potato fries. I had the black and bleu burger. Kinda pricy for being served with styro-cups and paper baskets.  Service was good, but we were the only ones there on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"My husband and daughter are addicted to this place and after eating here for the first time last night, I can see why!    We were cheerfully greeted by two of the most adorable young ladies; Lorna and Lilly.  They were so helpful by telling us about their favorite items, suggesting burgers based on our likes and dislikes (yes, they actually listened!) and modifying our order so my husband and I were both happy.  When our food came out, they were running back and forth to the patio with our many extra sauce demands - which might have irritated some waitresses but not these girls, they just seemed to get sweeter each time they returned!  Of course I can't forget to mention the old fashion style MALTS!!  Lorna and Lilly let me in on their secret concoction (although I'm not going to say what it was, you'll have to have them make one for you =) .. well, they nailed my taste buds perfectly- except it was even better than it sounded!  Oh, and the malts are made with \"REAL ICE CREAM\"!!   Aside from the excellent service we received, it doesn't hurt that their food is over the top amazing!!  They have a wide variety of \"gourmet\" burgers (and chicken burgers), everything was fresh and made to your specific request. Although I don't normally like mayonnaise, this was no regular mayo; this was an \"incredible signature homemade burger sauce\" that melts in your mouth!       Since our daughter was at camp last night, after we told her where we went she asked if we'd be willing to go back again tonight and of course we said yes!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for lunch. Wanted to sit outside however there were so many flies. Not appealing while eating. Also, we then decided to get it to go and we never received our order of fries after we did pay for them. Realized after we got home. Bacon was also really fatty on chicken club. Poppers and mozzarella sticks were good though.  Do not order a salad, they're cheap on the lettuce!"}
{"text":"I'm here at big earls. My husband and I had a cave Creek BBQ burger and a grilled cheese sandwich with pepper jack and bacon it was awesome. Another great thing was Sabrina bartender/waitress she was friendly and quick. Awesome job I will come back."}
{"text":"Big Earl's caught my eye driving through Cave Creek. Very divey looking, which is a draw. Burger exceeded expectations.   Plenty of \"stop in\" options in Cave Creek. Big Earl's would be my choice for a burger and a brew."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back. Waited like 20 minutes craving a burger. No signs saying I can't get lunch. Then I get told at 1040 I'd have to wait 20 minutes to get a burger. There was no line, not that hard to make a burger. I probably won't be coming again. Food is great, always long lines wish they could have just made me a burger a little early and I'd be a customer for life. Or at least have a sign on lunch saying 11 on........ seriously didn't have time today waited in line cause I was craving burger could have gotten a breakfast burrito anyway way to lose a customer"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast. Was a welcome relief after driving thru Cave Creek and no other breakfast places to eat. Great friendly service and great food. Like the portions and left there feeling good. Well priced. I will be back."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times now. The food is great. Staff is friendly. I love how the place has been converted from an old gas station to a burger joint. This last time around I had my pups with me hanging out on the patio. Everyone loved them. Ill make it a point, when I'm out in north Phoenix to visit this place."}
{"text":"Big Earl's Greasy Eats is simply a fantastic and fun place to sit down, take a load off your feet, and have a bite.  I keep meaning to try something different when I go in but always end up having one of their fabulous cheeseburgers or the delicious patty melt.  Fries, of course, and they have always been cooked and prepared to perfection, much better than any fast food restaurant that I know of.  You can't go wrong here.  The ambience is excellent; extremely casual, being a converted old western gas station situated right on Cave Creek Road.  There's always something to see while eating outside in the spacious, comfortable dining area; lots of action even if it's simply watching the cars and people go by.  They also have live music at night sometimes which is always a treat providing a wonderful party atmosphere!  Service has always, always been quick and friendly.  What's not to enjoy?"}
{"text":"Earl's has grown since it first opened as Big Daddy Mojo.  With breakfast, full bar and even stripper poles on the patio this has evolved into a fun place to enjoy great weather and a cigar."}
{"text":"Thi is a great place for food and hanging out. The food is great.  We have never had a bad meal.  The staff is fun and friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming.   We love the micro brew selection.  Mimosas or bloody Mary fire breakfast.  The burgers are killer.. ...  Highly recommended. Definitely worth a stop and enjoy \"downtown Cave Creek\"."}
{"text":"I know when it comes to ones favorite burger joints it's like fawning over ones kids or grandkids. There all good/great ...and one of a kind. I have been back many times each year we visit.The combination of the former gas station look, the low key vibe service and clientele would usually be enough for me but the burgers, the regular/sweet potato fries and a shake on a sunny afternoon seals the experience."}
{"text":"Ordered two salads one side and one Chicken Caesar two drinks and one side of sweet potato fries...total $26.00. The salads were so small that is was almost as if I were robbed.  It was a shame I didn't know sooner as I would have went down the street to Oregano's"}
{"text":"Stopped in to pick up a quick burger and normally they are awesome, but tonight I have no clue what happened... Got home and the burger was cold including the fries... The onion rings were partially raw and soggy!! So disappointed! Need to change your cook!"}
{"text":"Great, food and service. Staff was wonderful, let them know I was in a hurry they expedited my order. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Wow. Just love coming to this place when in town. Food & service is great. The morning cook is picture perfect great.    Only problem is I always eat to much.                 You just can't help it."}
{"text":"First, our burgers were amazing!!!! My fianc√©'s Big Kahuna was juicy, tasty and cooked to perfection. Ditto for my Kobe cheeseburger, our cajun fries, and onion rings. Sabrina was genuinely friendly, greeted us warmly upon entry and brought us our food as soon as it was prepared. She also made our malt...I think she put crack in the chocolate malt...I need another one. It was the best chocolate malt I've had in years! We left her just under 20% tip, which my fianc√© placed in the wrong bucket at first. I took it out ($6), clarified which bucket was hers and put it in there. The woman sat at the counter who later identified herself as a manager got an attitude and moved her tip bucket, and the drawer she was counting.  Anyway, when Sabrina brought our food I asked if she got the tip and she said \"Yeah, a dollar right.\" \"Nooooo, $6!\" So I went right inside, asked to speak with a manager, homegirl sticky fingers said she was one, so I told her to put the money back and she said \"okay\" without protest. Maybe she made a mistake...maybe, but I'm still docking a point.   It's clean, the decor is cool and the patio is nice and shady...just like a certain \"manager.\""}
{"text":"We live in Tempe and try to get up to Cave Creek/Carefree once or twice a year for lunch or drinks and dinner.  Let me start by saying, I LOVE a good burger.  Unfortunately, this is not it!  This is a dry, thin, overcooked, frozen patty accompanied by not quite hot and slightly chewy french fries.   It was not the worst burger I ever had, but there is no way it should be recommended to anyone.  I have had better frozen burgers made by the drunk guy at a Fourth of July BBQ.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because for one, its in beautiful Cave Creek and two, the girl behind the counter was incredibly friendly and cool.  Hate to give a bad review, but you can't tease us and call yourself \"Earls Greasy Eats\" and then serve bone dry burgers, it's just not right."}
{"text":"Save your time its not a diner its a wait in line counter with 1 register sloowww service I would not return for free food."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch - had a grilled cheese with bacon and the blue buffalo chicken sandwich. Also grabbed a basket of Cajun fries. Food was good and the patio had a nice atmosphere. Planning on coming back to try more!"}
{"text":"Son and I went yesterday and it was worth the drive.  I got the Big Earls burger special and he got the Chicken Fingers and fries.  For $20.00 it was really good.  The burger had a great flavor and was cooked just right.  The chicken was equally good for a 13 year old.  It got busy at lunch, line out the door but everyone wanted to be there.  Small, old roadside burger joint I would go to again...even from Buckeye!  Don't go if you want 4 star but if you want quaint and good go.  Service was good and polite, everyone was nice to you."}
{"text":"I live in Fountain Hills and often take drives through Cave Creek.  I always see Big Earl's and was always dying to try it but never had time.  Well, last Saturday hubby and I finally had time, and I'm so glad we did!!  We both had a Big Earl's burger, shared onion rings and to drink I had soda and hubby had a beer.  The burger was one of the BEST I have ever tasted, honestly!  It was juicy, big and had a yummy taste to it.  Overall, I will DEFINITELY be back!  PROS: YUMMY burger Beer was cold Cool atmosphere Service was decent Did I say yummy burger??  CONS (what prevented 5 star rating): Price...$25 for 2 people Burger was pink in the middle Limited seating inside (too hot outside to enjoy food) Onion rings needed some more seasonings."}
{"text":"Big Earl's is one of those places you can always rely on for good food and great atmosphere.   I've tried burgers all around Cave Creek / Carefree and Big Earl's seems to be the best. Couple that with the service, menu, music, fun atmosphere, and some of the latest hours in town..it's a no-brainer if you're hungry late at night, have some friends/family you want to hang out with, or just want a good burger."}
{"text":"This place has just about the worst service system that I have ever encountered!  Everyone stands in one line to order the food and beverages.  The night we went I had to stand in line for 20 minutes to get another round of drinks.  It seems like there should at least be a separate line to get drinks quicker.  The food was good once the wait was over."}
{"text":"If I could rate this place lower I would. My boyfriend took me here because he said he loved it. Everything looked good and we ordered. We took a seat and stayed there for 25 mins watching everyone be served but Us. My boyfriend finally went inside and they had forgotten about us! That's 25 mins of my life I won't get back. Hope this place goes bankrupt. Horrible costumer service."}
{"text":"There is something about the Carefree/Cave Creek area that I am just drawn to. It has a true Arizona feel and brings in a lot of tourists but also has some great bars and resturants. Last weekend my boyfriend stumbled upon a burger joint called Big Earl's Greasy Eats.  We went back for lunch and this girl who isn't the burger type was pleasantly surprised. The menu had a variety of different burgers, sandwiches and salads that you could choose from. They also have sweet potatoe fries which are my favorite! I ordered the sweet potatoe fries and a mushroom and swiss burger and my boyfriend order a classic cheeseburger and regular fries. We heard that their milkshakes were amazing so we got a Strawberry shake to share. You order inside but all the seating is outside so we found a spot outside. It was great for people watching and the weather was amazing so it was nice to sit outside. The food came within 10 minutes and I was pleasantly surprised that the burgers were not as greasy as I thought they would be given the name of the resturant! I am not a big burger fan but I ate the whole thing..it was delicious! The sweet potatoe fries were a great treat as well! The milkshake was good, but I personally didn't see what the big fuss was about them as it didn't taste like something I hadn't had before. We finished our beers (oh yah, they have a wide selection of bottle beers there as well!) and left happy. The price was great as well...for 2 burgers, 2 order of fries, a milkshake and 2 beers we spent about $26...not bad at all! I would definately come back to this place and recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Have been here many times, and it is very consistent and Delicious! Burgers are hot and juicy, and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty, dirty place.  The burgers were average.  Dead flies all over the window sills, dead flies mixed with the straws (note straws are packaged but still!!).  The folks are very friendly and the milkshakes are really, really sweet.  I could never go back though due to the cleanliness factor.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite burger place in AZ.  We will make the 45 minute drive just to enjoy a delicious burger and ice cold beer in the warm sun.  Love Love Love Big Earl's!"}
{"text":"Not fancy and not suppose to be either. Just cute and whimsical. Simply put I have only had the patty melts because they are so good!  A fn place to go that is not pricey!"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! My boyfriend and I stopped for a late lite dinner. I had the Chicken with mushroom and swiss and Cajun French fries. He had the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings. Staff was very friendly, We both really enjoyed our meal and we're glad we stopped. We plan coming back soon. Thanks and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"When I have friends visit from out of town we always go to local restaurants. Thankfully we don't have any chain restaurants except Dairy Queen in town. And everyone needs a blizzard now and then   I am not impressed by big earls but based on the reviews I would say give it a try and see how it works for you.  Maybe you will have a 5   But when I bring friends to Cave Creek I always do Harold's for breakfast and the hideaway for bar food lunch and dinner super burgers, sandwiches, pizza    But again, you might go to Earls and be transformed.  Just come to Cave Creek and try our local restaurants and shops."}
{"text":"I did not like this place.  I was into the retro look and 'dive' appeal but it basically a dive without anything GOOD about it.  It isn't the cheapest place and the burgers were not that good at all.  Setup is awkward, hard to get inside for soda refills.  I think this place only survives due to tourists.  They don't know any better.  I would not go back."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had in years. Sabrina recommended Cajun sweet potato fries with my amazing bacon cheeseburger, perfect pairing. Best burger in az so far imho, oh and the beer selection is damn good!"}
{"text":"I came in here the other morning for breakfast. Great food and service, and I love the building. However,  it smells like chemicals when you walk into the building.  This didn't concern me too much, until I looked outside and saw a can of fly spry. I took a picture of it and did some research... It says right on the back \"not safe for humans or animals\". I can only imagine this was the chemical smell inside.  There was also a lady using a blower outside while a customer was eating, I'm not sure if I'll ever be back. Put a bad taste in my mouth. Bummer, I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"My son talks about Big Earl's all all the time! I stopped in for breakfast this morning, and it REALLY is a fun place to eat and hang out. Andrew and Brooke are super friendly, and seem to genuinely enjoy working here.  Breakfast was exactly as I ordered it, and I loved the coffee! (I usually don't like the coffee many restaurants serve.)  Big Earl's was built in a 1950's style gas station. The old pumps are here, and I LOVE the vibe!  Now...take all of this, and put it in Old Town Cave Creek, and you have a winner!"}
{"text":"I had the black and bleu again. was not disappointed. Also the best adult shake ever.  Fireball and Rumchata. Yummy. We will be back again very soon. Great wait staff."}
{"text":"As someone who tries to stick to a healthy diet, this isn't a place I come often. However, I will admit that the milkshakes are phenomenal and the food is deeee-licious. The back of the spot is a fun sand volleyball court, it's a lot of fun to play if you've brought a ball and a few friends! If you're into tasty comfort food and a happy-go-lucky diner feel, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This place has great food, reasonable prices, and great customer service. It is my favorite place to eat in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"This place is cool and good food too. Staff is really friendly. Tons of different beers."}
{"text":"I've been going to Big Earl's for years - and in fact, can't go much more than about a month without eating there.  Ignore the nay-sayers...most of them are negative nancy's that don't have anything positive to say about anything or anyone.  I've travelled all over the country, many times over - and I'm here to tell you that I have NEVER had a burger anywhere that can compare with the Big Earl's Cheeseburger.  Nothing fancy....just the best-darned tasting meat and seasoning you've ever had, perfectly cooked every time.  Yes, it costs a little more than the average fast food burger joint, but your taste buds will understand why, and it's well worth it!  If you find yourself anywhere near Cave Creek, and you're even remotely hungry, drive directly to Big Earl's and enjoy just about the best burger on the planet.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Friendly service, interesting patrons, and great milkshakes. Before you get too excited, they are made with soft serve, but ours had real peanut butter and chocolate. Yum. Burgers and fries are also well made, if you plan on more than dessert. Yes, it is greasy, but didn't you see their name? I wish we'd stopped here sooner."}
{"text":"The burgers were average and everything was over priced. We paid $29 for two burgers, two onion rings, and two fountain drinks. Definitely overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I had their chicken fried steak for breakfast and it was just ok....the hash browns I ordered were as thin as paper and burned to boot...left a bad taste in my mouth overall...I don't plan on returning!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing! Perfectly cooked, secret sauce mayo on their Big Earl Burger is the best, and a full bar! You couldn't ask for more but it gets better! The atmosphere is the coolest, who doesn't want to eat at a 1930's gas station? And the staff the best example of \"Cave Creek hospitality\"! I dare you to not become a regular!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular for years and the food is pretty good. I usually get a custom burger. I love the breakfast burritos. Everything is customizable. They have fun events and a great atmosphere with very nice ppl and service."}
{"text":"Best peanut butter milkshake I've ever had. Good food. Friendly and helpful staff. Cute place and good prices. Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"My husband said that this was the best Blackened Blue Burger he has ever had.I finished my French Dip and regretted not ordering the Philly Cheese Steak to go! The meat was perfect!   He is across the table singing to the radio and expressing his extreme gratitude for a PBR and a good burger after a long day at work. We need more places like this in more accessible areas of the valley. Friendly service, great food, specialty drinks and beer. Please come to Central Phoenix, we need you!  And the coffee's not bad, either."}
{"text":"Beautiful Sunday afternoon, nice drive...fun atmosphere, good burgers, and shared an order of delicious French fries, and cold brew.  Nothing fancy here, but like I said,  fun atmosphere.  Would definitely take a cruise again."}
{"text":"Roadside burger joint that fits right in Cave Creek.  We liked this place for what it is and what it doesn't pretend to be.  If you want a quality burger at a reasonable price stop on in."}
{"text":"Ate here on Friday of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Around 1pm the line was quite long. A couple of things to note, if you've not been here before:  --Apparently the thing to do is snag a table BEFORE ordering. Everyone around us sent up someone to place the order for everyone else. Nice... --The menu lacks descriptions. What's on the Kahuna burger? No idea. You could probably ask at the register, but it isn't really the place to dally. Oh, and yep, there's only one register, and the woman working it was also the bartender, so if you want another round of beers or another side order of fries, apparently you just get to cut.  We both had burgers--me the swiss and mushroom, and he had the Big Earl. I got unpalatable sweet potato fries--they were fried beyond recognition and tasteless (we didn't see any attempt at seasoning). Hubby liked the spicy mayo on his burger, but his giant onion rings were also over-fried. So if you were one of all the other patrons who received beautifully golden fried goods, sorry for staring jealously at your plates, but we were pretty pissed.  We also had a milkshake. It comes out of a machine.   Ample parking in the back. Loved the old photos inside. Burgers had a nice char flavor. Probably won't come back, as most others noted."}
{"text":"Best freakin bleu buffalo chicken sandwich ever! Brooke is also the sweetest person ever! Love seeing her smiling face! And so glad they have Papago orange blossom beer! It's my favorite!"}
{"text":"Over a year ago I met an employee of Big Earl's named Shannon who worked at another restaurant and she highly recommended that I make the long drive from Scottsdale to try Big Earl's famous shakes and burgers. Because Shannon had provided top notch service and her previous recommendations were spot on, we finally made the drive from Scottsdale today and were utterly disappointed to say the least.  At a restaurant known for its famous burgers, we decided to give one a try, but unfortunately were turned down the opportunity at 10:21 am (lunch) to order because they \"didn't want the wait time for a burger to effect other breakfast eating customers.\" What??? The place wasn't busy at all and what type of burger joint refuses to sell burgers?  Needless to say we would never recommend this place to anyone. Apparently we aren't the only ones who feel this way either - http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/mystery-diners/100-series/big-earls-gone-wild.html"}
{"text":"Great burgers! I had the Big Earls Burger 1/3 burger cooked fresh for $5.99 can't be beat! I can see no reason to ever go to a McDonald's if Big Earls is open. The milk shakes are made with real ice cream I had the peanut butter milk shake, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here with the family after golf. We had 3 burgers one was Kobe and a buffalo chicken sandwich. regular fries, Cajun fries and a large chocolate, peanut butter milk shake. 2 bottles of water and a diet coke. Total was $56. What a deal. The place is good. Fresh burgers. Crunchy fries.   Fun patio that you can bring your dog to. I'd recommend it! Can't wait to try the breakfast. Full Bar too. Yummy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend an I go to big earls once a week for dinner after work an every time we go Niko is always there an he remembers our order every time and when we haven't gone for a while he remembers. He's always nice an talking to everyone an making sure everyone is satisfied with our food an drinks. We only go if Niko is there an when he's not there we don't eat there. We love the food an the people that work there"}
{"text":"I had cycled up to Big Earl's Greasy Eats for breakfast years ago and we'd enjoyed it but it's been a really long time.  Today my \"BFF\" Twyla and I hopped on the Triumph and headed up to Cave Creek for some sustenance and to enjoy this ( finally ) fine weather.  Burgers became the craving and we'd heard Big Earl's served up a good one; believe it - they make a fine burger, greasy as advertised and totally satisfying.  It's a little pricey, but they do seem to choose locally sources items so I always like that.  The menu is pretty extensive and there are multiple choices for sides. There's also a pretty nice drink selection. In our case we opted for the Crispin Original hard cider, which turned out to be a perfect choice alongside our burgers. I got the Mushroom Swiss burger, medium rare. Twyla selected the Blackened Bleu burger and we split a nice helping of Sweet Potato fries.  No frills here, just a damn good burger served up in a small paper container; greasy, moist, tender and just awesome.    The service was great as well. The young woman taking our order was really friendly, happy and engaging. Big Earl's is a converted service station and you still get that vibe. It's got character. There's plenty of shaded patio seating and some limited seating inside, including a small bar/countertop area where your order is taken.  There are some reviewers here that have commented on flies: while we also had some buzzing around, it's nothing I wouldn't expect sitting outside. Have you never experienced this, say on a picnic? Just a minor annoyance and frankly it didn't bother either of us in the least.   Big Earl's Greasy Eats is yet another destination I'll add to my list of spots. Next time I may ride up for an early morning coffee run.  Big Earl's gets two thumbs-up."}
{"text":"Best place in Cave Creek! Brooke can easily brighten anybody's day up! The service along with the food is always something to look forward to!"}
{"text":"I've been twice in the last few months and the food is pretty good and it's a fun looking atmosphere BUT the girl who took our order today had blue all around her nostril and her eyes were watery. She had clearly been snorting something and it made me very uncomfortable to have my 3 small children there. Seeing that was unappetizing. Her outfit was also very unprofessional. She had extrememly short shorts and a short mid drift tank top. She stood behind the counter cutting the tank top even shorter. Very strange. You could see much of her bra and stomach. I don't know if I'll be taking my kids there again."}
{"text":"Decent hamburgers and fries are ok. Little pricey for an order of fries, and 2 burgers. $30. Not a bad burger... but i still prefer Inn n Out for $10! Lol"}
{"text":"I went to Big Earl's yesterday because, unfortunately, Bryan's BBQ across the street was closed. My daughter ordered the kid's meal chicken fingers with fries and a drink. I ordered the kid's meal grilled cheese with sweet potato fries and a drink.  The girl behind the counter is very friendly, yes. But that doesn't change the fact that they use styrofoam cups (step it up for the environment!), or that the sweet potato fries were dry and stale, or that the grilled cheese had maybe one slice of cheese for the whole sandwich and was a bit burned.   My daughter could not eat because she was so appalled at all the different types of flies crawling on the windows (inside). She is 8 years old, and said \"Mom, this place is disgusting. They don't even clean the floors, and there are crumbs inbetween the seats here\". I think that says it all when a child can see how filthy a place is. One fly landed on her little cup of ketchup...ON the ketchup. (Shuddering at the memory).  For me to like a place, it has to be free of insects crawling inches from my food, or even ON my food. I have had better fries at fast food joints, which is sad. And, furthermore, my daughter refuses to go back.  Not good."}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast this morning. This place is cool! Lil old greasy spoon diner/bar set in a legit old gas station. They even left the canopy and fuel island intact complete with pumps. Tons of old auto and service station memorabilia and lots of neon. Chains spend lots of money on fake stuff to recreate this ambiance. This is the real deal!  While there are tables and picnic benches outside in the shade of the canopy and trees we decided to sit inside right at the counter. Savanah took our order and we quickly struck up conversation with her. Very friendly and personable. Made us feel welcome.  We ordered a 3 egg breakfast burrito w/ cheddar, onion, & potatoe. I had a cold glass of milk, she had coffee (which I was told was very good). The burrito came out fairly quick and was overstuffed. Glad we decided to share! Definitely would recommend it! Overall a fun little place. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time there. Disappointed. The burger was OK. A bit under cooked for my taste. The milkshake was weird. It left a slick coating of grease on the roof of my mouth. I could feel the little teeny globs of fat in it. It came out of a frosty type machine and then caramel was squirted into it and stirred up. Had to scrape it off the roof of my mouth with my napkin. Kinda gross. Needs some rust reduction on some items. Yes, it is a cute idea but pretty run down. The people that work there are super nice and helpful. Was really hoping for a great burger place, especially after all of the positive reviews. Maybe it was just an off day."}
{"text":"Big Earls is da bomb!! Butter burger, big kahuna, root beer floats, it's always worth waiting for (even during season behind the blue hairs)."}
{"text":"Having moved to Cave Creek from central Scottsdale just a few months ago, we've come to realize that the sidewalks in town roll up around 3pm. Makes it difficult to find some quick cheap food on those evenings when the day winds down and the hunger pangs kick in.   We've been eyeballing Big Earl's for awhile, and despite the \"Greasy\" namesake, finally decided to give it a try. Went there last week around 9pm for a burger. We both had the Kobe Beef Burger ($7.25-alacarte) and shared an order of Onion Rings. Burger was fair, a little overcooked, but, since they don't ask your temperature preference, I'll take what I get and be satisfied. Onion Rings were perfection - not the bread crumby coated type, these are battered and fried up to a good crisp yumminess. And yes - they serve alcohol. Good selection of domestic and artisan bottles, and by the look of it, can make you pretty much any mixed drink you like... they even have \"adult\" milkshakes.   Atmosphere was the typical gas station turned burger joint, with what was probably half of the teenagers who live in Cave Creek milling about, and some parents sitting on the misted patio. Good place for all ages.   Husband, having spied Chicken Fried Steak (his favorite) on the breakfast menu, talked me into trying it out this morning.He said the portion was just right, the gravy seasoned well, (which is hard to find) and the patty itself, while on the thin side, was better than most places he's tried so far. Toast had to be ordered separately. I opted for the French Toast, and chose to have it deep fried. Yum. Okay, it was more of a dessert than breakfast, but that's okay in my book. What can I say... how can you go wrong with FRIED French Toast, served with melting pats of butter and warm maple syrup. Coffee was good - I had a 32oz iced coffee and was pleasantly suprised at the quality.   Yes, there's more... we were there right before they switched over to the lunch menu, and oh happy day, it was their first day of \"Sunday Street Tacos for a Buck\"... this happens to be one of our favorite things to eat. So, of course, we had to try - they're a BUCK. 4.75 stars for the street taco. Could definitely eat a few for lunch and be completely satisfied. Little soft corn tortilla, with skirt steak (wasn't dried out like most places tend to be), some shredded cabbage and a little Pico de Gallo. All it needed was a lime wedge on the side.   There you have it. Wouldn't drive out of our way to go there, but for all you folks up North, it's a decent place to stop in for a quick bite. Good hours and decent prices give it 4 stars for us."}
{"text":"This place is an old gas station. We had a very good breakfast here. Inside decor is all gas station. They have their own T-shirts for sale. The owner even drives an old car. I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We love to eat at Big Earl's! For breakfast, the Chicken Fried Steak is one of the best out there! For lunch I suggest the Big Earl Burger with Green Chili & and an egg added! And don't forget the cajun fries :)"}
{"text":"I generally bring my wakeboarding crew here after a long day on the lake at Bartlett. I always get the Kobe Burger, it is worth the upgrade! The sweet potato fries are awesome too. They even have Hamm's Beer. I love this place! Sand volleyball in the back and music up front!  I love you Kim!"}
{"text":"It's a cute place from the outside, VERY small inside, and the food is really mediocre.  The hamburgers were barely edible and the fries weren't even as good as McDonald's.  The servers were nice but I won't go here again."}
{"text":"Holy delicious! The burgers are hormone-free and super yummy! Got the Big Earls with American cheese and it was top notch. Fries were tasty too!"}
{"text":"Randi & Danielle are the bomb.com! Great service and food! Try an alcoholic milkshake!! To my knowledge this is one of the original places in Cave Creek - good job with keeping it up and running! Always good to stop by for a burger ! Family friendly as well"}
{"text":"Stopped here after reading other Yelp reviews,  and wasn't disappointed.   Great burgers and chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"Best burgers in cave creek hands down.  And don't forget the awesome shakes. Love to go and bring the dogs"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger in town! ~ If you love a good mushroom and Swiss premium-grade hamburger served on a fresh Kaiser bun, you MUST try this one of their many creations... (Make it medium-rare!) Then there's the amazing Big Earl's team... Walk in this nostalgic 50's gas-station-turned-diner, and you'll be immediately welcomed by Brooke and the crew like family. ~ I swear, I don't think there's anyone's name they don't remember; and if they haven't met you yet, you will be invited back. This is certainly one of Cave Creek's greatest gems. Spend an afternoon perusing the shops in town and then treat yourself to what I am certain you will also begin referring to as your favorite hamburger joint. - Michael in Cave Creek"}
{"text":"Big Earl's gets big raves from me!  The blue burger is great, as are the fries.  The only thing I didn't love was the milkshake."}
{"text":"Fast, easy eats plus beer and booze in a funky retro gas station on the main drag in Cave Creek. We had breakfast on our way out of town. Indoor/outdoor seating by the gas pumps. Food came quick, but then it wasn't crowded. Decent fare. Can't beat the ambience."}
{"text":"I like supporting locally owned businesses, so I decided to stop in Big Earl's Greasy Eats, today. I don't really have much good to say, about Big Earls, so this is going to be very short.  I ordered a regular burger, onion rings & an iced tea. Price was $14.00, plus. Burger and o' rings, were mediocre, at best. Iced tea, was bad. Service was pretty good, considering I had to go to the counter, and order it myself. I thought it a little humorous, that they had a tip jar, right there by the register. I guess they feel they're entitled, even if they didn't do anything, but take my order.   Installing a tip jar, for little or no service, seems to be the norm, in no-service restaurants, in Phoenix, and its offensive and smacks of arrogance. Kinda like showing up at your place of employment, then expecting an increase in pay, if you actually have to perform manual labor.   I don't want to pick on Big Earls, but I don't see the attraction. I would've been better off, going to Mickey D's or Wendy's, before I got into Cave Creek. And, I could've been a little heavier, in my wallet. Sorry, Big Earls! I did you a favor, by giving you 3 stars."}
{"text":"I did not meet Big Earl, but we were met with very friendly and helpful staff, a great lunch menu and super tasty malts!  We stopped for lunch on a fairly busy day but still had no problem with getting our order out on time.  It is as it's advertised - a greasy spoon - but a pretty darn good one and I would go back when in the area again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome..whether you are guests to our town or a home towner, Big Earls treats you like a neighbor or a friend.   The burgers, beer and biscuits and gravy are the best. The cashier, waitress, and barrtnder is also the owner so she is really in touch with what is going on...so it is service with a smile!!!"}
{"text":"I guess if you put the word greasy in your restaurant title, it excuses all bad foods and greasy stuff and makes it acceptable. My next restaurant will be called Brad's terrible dining - so that should excuse me if somebody doesn't like my food right?     Well, the food wasn't that greasy, but it wasn't anything great either. Burgers are 1/3 pound and average about $8, not including fries. While I appreciate blue cheese, way too much was put onto my blue burger and the wet onions did not help things out much. The patty itself was again just average and the onion rings were empty, just like an air ring. Outside patio is nice, but this seems like a place for tourists, who will be amazed at the slogans and \"legendary\" burgers. Most of the time legends are false and better burgers are available almost anywhere including fast food. Tourist Trap in little ole' cave Creek."}
{"text":"Literally the BEST burger I've ever had... and those french fries are amazing too. I crave Big Earls every day, it's not good! Staff is fun too, I always enjoy chatting with the waitresses while waiting for my burger!"}
{"text":"Just cant get that burger fealin about this place.. It was so generic,So yesterday ,So bla bla bla Best part about this place is the Name. Bummer it doesn't live up to it."}
{"text":"I was bummed that we didn't like this place more. Hubby and I had lunch there today and the food was really mediocre for the price. We both had kobe beef burgers, and while they were cooked to order (mine medium-rare and his well) they were pretty flavorless. The fires were cold by the time they reached us -- it took a solid 20 minutes to get our food. The milkshake from a machine was actually really good, though. I'm intrigued by street tacos mentioned by someone below and might stop in again to check those out when I see them advertised, but other than that we'll skip it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious dinner last night with 3 friends at Big Earls so not greasy eats.  The burgers were excellent and the salads perfect!! The Jewel of the Creek salad is absolutely sumptuous! Super green and fresh!! Yum! Love this restaurant every time.  On the dark side the tater tots are really good too.   did you know you can play volleyball any time except Thursday when it's league? Nice sandy court. Oh and the Staff is super friendly and efficient! Almost all outside dining.  Go and check it out!!"}
{"text":"Love Big Earl's Greasy Eats!!!! Probably the best burger I have found in the Phoenix area. I've been stopping here on my way back from hiking in Sedona... a little counter productive, I know, but the burgers are just too tastey not to stop for. The blackened blue burger has been my running favorite so far. The diner is also something to stop for, it's like a vintage gas station - love it! The service is always great and the food comes out very quickly."}
{"text":"Ate there twice this weekend. The Mushroom and swiss burger was really good. Their malts were just as great tasting as usual. Definitely get one! Their sweet potato fries I could eat a tub full of.  The staff were super friendly both times, and it was a great experience. I Brought some friends with me the second time ans they enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"Been there four times in the past few weeks.  Consistent and tasty.  Their chocolate shakes are great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Just walked from the Buffalo Chip to here to EAT! Yes, yummy burgers!!! Love you Big Earls!"}
{"text":"Stopped by because of reviews and pet friendly patio. Large outdoor patio by the main road so a bit on noisy side. Ordered big earl burger, fried chicken sandwich and side of onion rings. Burger was fairly good but over cooked, chicken breast was very thin and seemed over fried as well as sub par onion rings. Will try another place in Carefree when here again."}
{"text":"Quaint atmosphere with retro gas station decor, beautiful mountain view (at the back, though). The four mini-burgers I ordered were overcooked and quite dry. Two stars for now; might change with my next visit."}
{"text":"We had family in town a couple of weeks ago and stopped in to Big Earl's after a short trip to Bartlett Lake.  There were 4 kids under 10 yrs who needed a snack.  Or else.    This was my second visit and I didn't eat much--just an order of onion rings and a couple of my son's chicken tenders.  The food was just ok--not great and not very greasy.  I do like their chocolate shakes :o)  What I love about this place is the decor and the service.  The decor is   definitely gimmicky, but not annoyingly so.  I love the old gas station feel.  And the kids loved it to."}
{"text":"Driving down the road through Cave Creek, Arizona, just before heading out of town and looking for some lunch how could you not stop at a place called Big Earl's Greasy Eats?  Seriously! I have to admit, the name scared my teenage daughter, but with a little bit of coaxing, we went inside the converted gas station.  Go inside and place your order before taking a seat outside, where someone will bring your food while yelling your name. If it hasn't already been, this place is a prime candidate for Food Network's Diners, Drive ins and Dives.  It is a place for both locals and tourists alike. The food was good.  It was not greasy, much to the relief of my daughter.  I had the mushroom swiss burger and it was cooked perfectly - very tasty.  My fries were also really good.  My daughter had the grilled chicken sandwich and a side salad.  The chicken was big and, somewhat surprisingly, the salad was quite good - basic, but good.  Prices were a little high for a \"dive\" but not too bad. There was a pretty good selection of food and the service was good.  The atmosphere was very cool.   Bottom line is you cannot drive by a place named Big Earl's Greasy Eats and not stop for a bite to eat.  When you do stop, you'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Place looks dirty. Spent 29.00 on 2 sandwich, 2 fries, and 2 sodas. Out door patio is awful need repair almost tripped on the way out. Needs new paint and new out door furniture. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Fun & Funky in Cave Creek! Great visuals within this tiny establishment and to the backdrop beyond. The girl behind the counter was kind and seemed really happy to be working there - not something you find often at a burger stand & it was a nice welcome!  So, let's get to our menu....the regular fries left a bit to be desired, but the sweet potato fries were AWESOME. The patty melt was kinda average (could use more seasoning in the beef) but made with naturally-raised beef, which is a plus.....My son's burger had creamy pepper jack cheese and black pepper chipotle mayo (I think that's what the ingredients were) which was yum.....and we both had plenty on our plates.  All in all, a good visit and we'll go back to try it again :)"}
{"text":"After having lived in the area for a few months, we have found that there aren't a lot of options for great food in Cave Creek. We tried Big Earl's Greasy Eats a few days after moving into town (mainly because it had been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives) and we weren't super impressed, mainly because we felt that the service was lacking and the food was average.   We have since been back to Big Earl's and our opinion has changed. The menu offers a number of different options, but we tend to like the hamburger options or chicken sandwiches. I am a fan of the mushroom Swiss. Our kids really like the hot dogs and the sweet potato fries. There is a nice area to sit outside (seating indoors is pretty limited) and enjoy the beautiful Cave Creek scenery, especially as the evenings become cooler.  What has really stood out recently is the excellent customer service. Both times over the last few weeks, the staff has been very friendly and helpful. I ordered my food to-go this weekend and the super nice lady helping me took the time ensure that my order was correct (nothing worse than getting home to find that you are missing someone's meal). She took time to talk with my 4 year old (that will always win me over) and offered her a sample of the ice cream. I am glad that we have given Big Earl's a few more chances and will continue to return!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple days ago for the first time. When I sat down at the counter, it was not clean. It was sticky and you could still see the rings from the drinks that were previously there. The young lady who was behind the counter was nice, but she was more interested in texting and talking on the cell phone then anything else. The food was not good at all. On one positive note, I have to say that the milkshake was very good.  But it wasn't enough for me to ever want to return."}
{"text":"This might be the worst breakfast I have had this year. DO NOT order pancakes or anything w potatoes. Burned, overlooked. No menu items include regularly included items such as toast or potatoes.  This is probably the worst place I have been in cave creek. I can't stress enough NOT to eat at big earls"}
{"text":"No blues at Big Earls. This is good food and relaxing large patio (except car beeping in parking lot..:). I had the blackened blue burger. It was perfectly cooked medium rare with grilled onions and accompaniment. It was delicious. Big Earls has my vote as best hamburger in the greater Phoenix area. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"}
{"text":"Big Earls has been in cave creek as long as I can remember. If a hangover has set in, a mushroom Swiss with bacon and the delicious Cajun fries are just what the doctor ordered. The milkshakes are decadent, the beer selection is diverse and the servers are typically cute! Perfect for a weekend lunch when visiting cave creek."}
{"text":"Stopped by this weekend after camping to get a burger. Usually, after camping just about any food is amazing. This was kinda a disappointment. The service was OK and the setting was right-on but the food was pretty typical and nothing special. These people think that they are cool or something, but they are just average phoenix mouth-breathers."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite burger place of all time. It is a great place for burgers. Really great staff. I been coming here for a long time. Highly recommend. The place itself has great decor."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food here and I hear the breakfast is good as well.  Go with the Turkey Burger and Sweet Potato fries!"}
{"text":"Not super greasy like the name suggests, but really good juicy, hormone free hamburgers. A decent sized list of microbrews available. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were good, also."}
{"text":"It is what it is. Greasy food that is great way to carb up after hiking Black Mountain. Great patio area and good Bloody Mary action."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!  They've got some greasy delicious eats!  Their burgers are fantastic & flavorful (I can tell their beef is fresh & never frozen).  They have a large variety of different treats but their burgers are their feature flavor!  A little history... In 2013, this restaurant was featured on a reality TV show called \"Restaurant Stakeout\".  The show involved setting up hidden cameras & catching employees in unruly acts.  SPOILER ALERT.... The Earl's \"saucy\" episode featured a waitress being naughty with someone in the bathroom... Absolutely hilarious.  Just in case you haven't figured it out- \"reality\" TV shows are scripted & actors are hired. Waah-Waaaah.  It was all staged... BOOOO!!!  Although, it was one hell of a restaurant plug!  It got us talking about it, right?  Now go there, eat their awesome burgers and do naughty things in the bathroom, people- we've got to make this \"reality\" TV more real!"}
{"text":"I was a little surprised that the food wasn't all that greasy. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak and Cajun fries, and they were both probably less greasy than average.  The sandwich was pretty good - nothing special, but definitely a passable cheesesteak. The fries were tasty, not heavy on the Cajun spices, but nicely seasoned.  It's not the fanciest place around, and probably not worth a special trip from Phoenix, but it's someplace I'd go back to next time I'm in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I could get a better burger at the AM/PM market.   We were attracted by the cute exterior, don't be fooled.  They were busy and I think it was because they were slow getting the food out.  anything but greasy ,  very little lettuce, buns weren't even warm.  The owners should get a clue."}
{"text":"Solid burgers here folks!  The place is very small with limited indoor seating, but there is a nice patio when the weather permits.  Very cute place that has nice, greasy burgers."}
{"text":"We really loved breakfast here! The kids devoured the pancake and French toast. My husband really enjoyed the breakfast potatoes, he said with onions and peppers they'd be absolutely perfect! My eggs were cooked just right and the hash browns were crispy. You have to order at the counter, which I don't love, but the service was quick and the food was yummy! We ate outside on the patio and it was a fun location in Cave Creek, we were happy with our experience overall!"}
{"text":"Found this gem with yelp. OMG I'm such a fan now! With the first bite of my Biig Earl burger I knew that I would be back often. Fantastic burger and perfectly done fries. Took a chocolate malt for the ride home and loved it!   Highly recommend this place. Doesn't look like much from the outside but they are working magic in the kitchen!!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian, it's hard to find a decent burger that isn't made with black beans! Earl's, however has come to my rescue. They've got amazing burgers, shakes, fries, and tater tots! It's obviously delicious. You can tell by the masses of people eating here on the busy weekends."}
{"text":"Their name says it all! Great place to stop in town, and hands down, the best milk shakes for miles around. Don't leave without one!"}
{"text":"We live in Cave Creek & this is a fav. The burgers are cooked perfectly how you like them & are the best in town. I would recommend the food if you like burgers & french fries"}
{"text":"We come here every time when we are vacation the blackened blue burger is my favorite as are the onion rings keep up great work and the awesome food."}
{"text":"Love the burgers and onion rings. We take our kids and our dogs to sit outside. We enjoyed breakfast one early Saturday morning and watched the high school homecoming parade. It's great good and good location. Fun for the whole family."}
{"text":"Under cooked burger, basic fries and a soda for a little over $9.  sorta rude environment.  probably will never go back."}
{"text":"I just eaten  here for the first time and this place is the first good dinner I have had in cave creek ever simple and good it's worth a visit burgers and beer. Friendly and not over priced nice place fun place"}
{"text":"I like the vintage look of the location . Reason I gave it two stars . Food was way over priced for the taste . Honestly tasted like any average burger . My husband got the Kobe Burger and I got the Big Earl . At the end of our meal we said we should've went to In & Out instead .. That's how disappointing the food was .... Oh and the fried Zucchini we got cost $7 and seriously we ate like 5 because it tasted like it came out of a pre frozen bag and just put in the fryer . When we got there no one welcomed us , it was our first time there so we weren't sure what to do. We sat outside because of the pretty lights and atmosphere and not even 5 minuets later the lights were turned off on us . We couldn't even see our food .. We drove 30 min because of the reviews . Doesn't make sense it wasn't good . Unfortunately will not be coming back ."}
{"text":"(written by susan) One word - YUM!!!! Had the blue cheese burger (they have 2 versions) and small choc shake - wish I had ordered the large one! Just like the burgers and shakes I grew up with in the 60's! I am hooked. After a lunch at Indian Village, the next day's lunch will be here at Big Earl's. Great service and yummy, old fashioned burgers and shakes done right!"}
{"text":"Overrated. Burgers are dry. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I have had in the Phoenix area! I love the atmosphere, the staff is always friendly and really helpful with the menu. The selection is large and if you're not in the mood for a burger they have some sandwiches as well. Great place to snag a burger and a brew!"}
{"text":"Always been wanting to stop by here and finally did. I was so glad I did, as the burger was really good and the service was outstanding. I will be coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"I Live in queen creek almost two hours away from this place but it is still worth the drive for an incredible burger and a cold beer with excellent service and kind and courtious staff thank you BIG EARLS GREASY EATS"}
{"text":"I had been by here several times on lunch hour, but parking was typically difficult.  On this occasion a car  had just departed and I found a spot, so in I went.  The order counter had their specials up front and center - Nice, makes it easy on us first - timers.  I ordered the lunch special; chicken sandwich, salad or fries (salad for me) and 24 oz soda.  Total price with tax was $8.77.  The salad was great, lots of variety and when I had chosen teh bleu cheese dressing the lady at the food order counter asked me if I wanted crumbled bleu on it.  Yes Please!  She didn't skimp and this was one great salad.  The chicken sandwich had a spicey rub on it which was just the right touch to balance the salad. Priced well, quick service, lots on knick-knacks onthe walls."}
{"text":"Came here after the pumpkin festival for dinner. I we got here at about nine on a Friday night and it was really the place to be! It seemed like it was the hangout spot for the nearest high school because the place was packed with high school kids. I ordered the Kobe burger. They forgot about it under the heat lamp until I asked for it so it was pretty cold by the time I got it. It could've been a good burger had they served it on time. The burger was dried out, but the toppings were good and it had good flavor. I really liked the fries but again, cold. The only weird thing was their ranch dressing. It tasted like mayo. The place itself was super cute! They have a huge patio and it felt super old school. I would come back, but maybe not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I asked my Hubby to pick a place for his birthday and he chose Big Earls. We were greeted by Lorna,  a big haapy smile on her face and also Lily, Michael and Avalon. I said, wow you guys are happy and smiling. I had a kobe beef burger, and the taste of the char from grill was delicious. Hubby had the earl burger and loved it. Lily made us a prickly pear margarita and it was also yummy. This happy crew then sang the happy birthday song. It made for a special nite for us. We will be back to try other food and visit with our new friends."}
{"text":"Good food and a cool spot in cave creek. I gave them 4 stars because everything was good or better than expected. They could step it up a bit and the concept is similar to the other cave creek bars. But they do a good job here and I eat there now and then. I forgot to mention that they had a great selection of local beers every time I have come in. Big plus for me."}
{"text":"Good service, good food and a nice atmosphere. Sat outside and it was great! A nice little toad even joined us for dinner."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. I was hoping for a great local greasy burger joint, but the burgers aren't good, they don't even ask for temp. And they all came burnt, which is so unusual for the area. The ordering process was cumbersome and the tables where really dirty. I also wanted an adult shake, which apparently only come with beer, so they made me a soda with vodka but I'm pretty sure there was no alcohol in it. I'd been having a bad day and it was really disappointing. When we were finally settled and had food, other customers left their young child out at one of the high bar tables alone while they went inside and ordered, and this child proceeded to run around, climb on things and make incredibly loud annoying noises and no one came out to check on him. So, I won't be back. Although the concept is great the execution is poor and there are so many other places that make a truly great burger in this area."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by Earl's for lunch.  Once we ordered (and it took about 20 minutes to order) - we waited another 35 minutes to get our food (we just ordered 2 burgers with fries).  And one of the frustrating things about the wait was the food runner was also emptying out the garbage - and naturally she spent about 5 minutes doing that - and the next thing she did was bring our food to us.  So that was pretty creepy.  And on top of that - the burgers and fries were served - at best - barely warm,  So they had to have been sitting for awhile before being served (I'm guessing they were sitting there the whole time the server was playing with the trash cans).  And once they arrived - truly nothing special about the burgers.  The fries were just meh - and the burgers not that good, either.  We were very disappointed in the food - and wasted an hour incurring that disappointment.  There's got to be better places to eat in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"We stopped in today (buy local!) for lunch and wow, how sad a trip was this. The order taker took a phone order in front of us after we had been waiting for several minutes with no one in front of us. (hello, they can hold. I am standing RIGHT here) They were out of the advertised Not Your Father's Root Beer. All of the perimeter tables were dirty. Our burgers arrived cold without cheese, accompanied by cold fries and cold rings. But the worst thing was that the burgers were dry and salty, straight up not good at all. I feel a little ill just thinking about it. I should have said something while we were there, but the cook was SO nice (a terrible cook but hey) and the order taker was SO unfriendly that we just ate what we could and left. I sure hope the help wanted sign is taken advantage of soon to get a better cook and a better order taker. For $35 (including tip) I expected so much more."}
{"text":"Well they may live up to its \"greasy\" name but they also have some surprises up their sleeves. For example, they also have salads and chicken sandwiches besides tasty looking burgers and milkshakes! On my first visit, I enjoyed the Big Kahuna Chicken Sandwich which is their take on the teriyaki chicken sandwich and I used all the will power I had to not order the fries to go with it. Instead I went with the side salad. I sat on the funky patio and enjoyed taking in the old gas station scenery such as gas pumps. I also noticed a sand volleyball court in the back and it looks like they do volleyball games and activities on occasion. The meal came out fast, by the server with a huge smile on her face. The chicken sandwich was juicy and tender and the sauce on it was pretty flavorful. I was surprised that it was a creamy-based teriyaki sauce which turned out to be pretty tasty and the grilled pineapples were the perfect touch. The food was decent but nothing that I'd say is a \"must-try\" but the atmosphere and decor has a lot of character. All in all, it's a nice spot to visit for a casual meal during a day in Cave Creek. Next time I visit, I'll try the Kobe burger and a milkshake, but for my first visit, I can definitely confirm that I'd visit this greasy eatery again."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here after spending the day at the lake...I had the cheese burger with green chili and fries and my boyfriend had a cheese burger as well. I have to say these were AMAZING burgers! We also loved that the patio was dog friendly as well! BONUS!!! We will be back soon for sure!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I tried the place because of it's name, but I'm glad I did.  The food ranged from very good (the burger) to superb (the sides, shake, and brownie).  Great, friendly, happy service to boot!  Live music too."}
{"text":"Too darn hot in dead of summer, floor fans don't get it people. Food is mediocre, no vanilla ice cream for floats, that's bad management. Would not try again..."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger person but the burgers they have here are amazing. I love the antique feel of the place and they also show a lot of the history behind cave creek. They have GREAT burgers that are unique and awesome fries."}
{"text":"The concept of turning a gas station into a diner, is unique.  The food was average at best.  The food definitely wasn't worth the price.  Red Robin has better food."}
{"text":"EDIT: I'm not sure what the owner is trying to say under my review. I was supposed to order vegetables? And, I got the most expensive burger, which is why I was disappointed. It was 10$. Kobe is Kobe beef. This was NOT it. False advertising. It  tasted like a old patty you would buy at Fry's. I guess the tourists can't tell the difference? Def has gone down hill I had the same burger 5 years ago, and it was stellar. New owners?"}
{"text":"Just an update to show I appreciate Big Earl's.  Friends in from Florida and when we said \"let's go out to dinner\", they said they'd like a great hamburger.  So I took them to Big Earl's.  And they said GREAT hamburger!!!  I love it when there is truth in advertising!"}
{"text":"This is really a perfect burger joint.  It sits in the unique and fun village of Cave Creek, with bikers everywhere and interesting cowboy architecture up and down the strip.  It's so nice to eat in a non-chain burger shop.  The burgers are delicious as are the onion rings, fried zucchini and french fries.  They have yummy shakes and even some healthier options like soup and salad for those concerned with their waistline.    Here is a shout-out to the owner.  The ladies you have working for you are always friendly, natural and helpful.  It makes the experience pleasant and delicious at the same time."}
{"text":"This place looks cute enough, and is quite unique, but the hamburgers tasted like frozen burgers... not what you expect at a place that's supposed to be known for its burgers. The barbecue burger is reminiscent of Carl's juniors burgers, but the latter is better and A ton cheaper. Another disappointing meal in cave creek."}
{"text":"Excellent milkshakes and quirky location. Service was pretty fast and the burgers and fries looked good (although I didn't try them)."}
{"text":"All of us had breakfast, of sorts. My grilled cheese on sourdough was pretty basic. I think I paid $7 for some melted cheese slices on toasted sourdough.  Other items ordered by my group: breakfast burrito (\"Sorry, we're out of salsa\"), said to be decent, but again pretty basic. Another ordered a veggie burger and it was suggested to add fried eggs to it, which he did. He said it was very tasty.  Will I go back? Probably not. That was a long haul from Phoenix. If I find myself some morning in Cave Creek I would consider it.   Oh, and also no (or broken) air conditioner. FAIL!"}
{"text":"Yummy burgers!  A great local place to stop for a quick bite out on the patio."}
{"text":"Big Earls Greasy Eats says it all!  It's most definitely a greasy (and super size the greasy part) spoon dinner converted from an old gas station from back in the day.  We've passed this place so many times on our way to eat at other restaurants in Cave Creek and keep saying we are going to stop, but never do until now.    As always, I pull up the Yelp reviews prior to going anywhere anymore and found this place had several mixed reviews.  So I called on a few local long time residents that are good friends and also got mixed reviews from them as well.  I also looked them up on the \"Best of the Valley\" ratings and saw they were listed as one of the best in the entire Valley.  And so begins our new culinary adventure as a family on a Sunday afternoon.  Big Earls is a greasy spoon that is clean and has a fun ambiance for very casual dinning.  This is an old gas station converted into a dinner.  They offer limited seating inside so we dined outside with lots of room to move around.  The weather was awesome which made our experience more delightful.    The service was very good, friendly and welcoming.  The food was average at best.  We had the Blue burger with fries, the Big Earl Classic with fries.  Our burgers were served on a potato role that was supposed to be grilled and was not.  The meat on both burgers were cooked very well done, which we did not order them that way.  Our fries were also very plain and average as well unfortunately.    We had such high hopes for Big Earls Greasy Eats based on our first impression of walking past the old gas pumps (very cool!) and into the dinner where we were greeted and served by a very friendly person (fantastic service).  But the food did not live up to the hype from some the other Yelp reviewers nor the \"Best of the Valley\" ratings.  Since this was our first visit I will not give them a 2 star rating but rather a 3 star rating based on their service and ambiance.  I also plan to revisit Big Earls soon to give them another chance just in case the cook was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. I love the look. Very vintage, old gas station, pumps still around for decor, with old time-y diner music to complete the mood. I just stopped in for a burger and got a basic hamburger with tomato, lettuce, pickles, and mayo, and it was anything but basic. Now THAT'S a good burger. Fresh with just a hint of pepper (?), thick and juicy. The server delivered it with a friendly smile too. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone in the Cave Creek area looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Restaurant name: Big Earl's Greasy Eats  Judging Criteria:  First appearance: Ok, not the best I've seen. Extras hanging out all Willy nilly. The toasts bun and patty itself look nice.   Flavor:  So good. So, so, so good... Looks can be deceiving. The seasoned beef is grade a, perfectly cooked and very flavorful. The perfect amount of toppings and mayo. I can't speak highly enough of the taste.   Meat to bun ratio: It was spot on. Everything finished together and at the same time. The patty to bun thickness was also on point. Neither outweighed the other.   Included extras (veggies / condiments): Lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, onions, real mayo  Price: $5.99  Grade: A = Amazing burger. Wonderful flavorful and worth every penny. Worth traveling across town for."}
{"text":"I've had the Big Earl Burger twice, and the blackened chicken sandwich. Both were excellent. The buns they use are top notch. You gotta have a bug up your a$! to not like this place. You pay a little more, but you can taste the difference. All natural, antibiotic-free, no hormone added chicken and beef."}
{"text":"Our group loved Big Earl's!  Neat old gas station with fun decor!  We really didn't have a meal just sweet potato fries, regular fries, a couple of their yummy milk shakes - you gotta try one - lot's of choices!  Service was minimal but with a smile and very helpful.  Love Cave Creek and Big Earl's will be another stop we want to make!"}
{"text":"Such yummy food and a fun vibe! There is even a sand volleyball court in the back. The owner, Brooke, is absolutely amazing, and really cares about creating the best customer experience! From quality of food, to a fun and inviting atmosphere, I am never disappointed when I head to Big Earl's. The entire staff is friendly and welcoming, and it's very conveniently located next to cute little shops & bars. A great spot for both locals and visitors."}
{"text":"I believe I'm in love!     Great burgers, rings, and beers!    My home away from home!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in Cave Creek for a bite! Also there is a little ice cream shop called The City Creamery down the street that is unreal!"}
{"text":"Basic burger with so so fries.  I also ordered the rings and I got a blank stare.  Rings, I said again.  Same blank look.  Third time I guessed the problem - onion rings please?  Ah they knew what those were.    The place is dilapidated as gas pumps sitting in the patio. If you don't mind waiting forever and sitting outside where half the heaters are broken, then it's not a bad place to eat.  Just go when it's warm."}
{"text":"The food is not bad.  The food is not great.  Will you be sad if you eat here?  No, just a little light in the old bank account versus what you get."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon for eats n drinks.  Breakfast is especially good! Service can be a little on the slow side so plan ahead on time.  If you're up here, you're probably not in a hurry anyway.  But, do t get the knickers twisted if it takes a while."}
{"text":"Overpriced overcooked been there a couple times got worse and worse never go back. Place sucks"}
{"text":"I like FRIES with my burger, not FLIES..... the flies were everywhere !!!! Sitting on your drink, chilling on your burger, helping you eat your side salad.    COME ON PEOPLE..... there were hundreds. How can I review a veggie burger when 99% of my time is swatting flies.   This place isn't for me.  I've been to a lot of  rustic outdoor restaurants all over AZ but this was by far the worst.    So if you like flies with your burger this place is for YOU!"}
{"text":"We've been coming for the burgers for years. They are always delicious and it's a great place to just hang out with friends, and your dog. Just had breakfast here for the first time and it was great. Ask for the tater tots."}
{"text":"Perfect evening at Big Earls. Delicious juicy burger. Great service. Incredible beer selection and my husband loves the Adult Salted Caramel milkshake. We all played on the sand volleyball court & enjoyed the gorgeous views. Really special place. Cave creek is so lucky to have this place!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited forever for a kid's meal of chicken strips. We had to walk up and ask about it since it took so long. Went up and placed an order for a milkshake thinking it wouldn't take as long. Took about 20 minutes and asking about it twice to finally have it made. Would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great outdoor patio and good vibe. Warm and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Best Patty Melt in town! Expresso milk shakes are awesome. New owner is doing a great job!!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the best restaurant in Cave Creek. If you want a great burger, definitely stop by. None of the other food in the area can compete.  The burgers have a nice peppery taste. The owner, Brooke, is doing really great things with the place.  Service can take a bit long sometimes and the prices are slightly above what I'd expect to pay for this sort of food, but it's usually worth it.   I recommend the Big Earl burger with an egg on it!"}
{"text":"Not great burgers topped off with a mediocre malt.  Couldn't sit correctly inside as the seats are so much taller than the tables.  Weird.  Being Aug in AZ it was hot, but we braved outside under the misters.  Not nearly as good as it used to be.  Probably won't go back and we used to love to go there.  Sadly things change.  Kim - We were there for lunch on 8/6 and it was around 2:00 - 2:30."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the veggie burger. My hubby enjoyed his burger. The young girls working there are nice. Its nice to be able to bring the dogs!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing! The fries aren't even worth paying for, I wish I hadn't bought them. Inside seating is minimal so I had to opt for outside seating which would have been ok if it wasn't for all of the flies swarming my food. Service is good. I love the sand volleyball court they have out back!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! My favorite burger is the blue cheese burger and you've got to order one of their milk shakes. They make a fantastic chocolate malt shake with a shot of espresso. OMG heaven!!!  Lastly the don't skimp on the straws for the shakes the are big and wide. Great job guys! There's nothing worse than trying to drink a thick shake using a wimpy, skinny soda straw. I just love the casual environment (it's a renovated gas station) and feel good food.  A++ place!!!"}
{"text":"A fun establishment to have a quick bite.  Nothing fancy, sandwiches, hot dogs, hamburgers, etc.  It is small and seating is limited.  If you're yearning a grilled cheese sandwich, this is the place.  Wander the area after a meal for some souvenirs."}
{"text":"They makes some pretty good burgers, but by far my favorite thing on the menu is the Bleu Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. That thing is amazingly delicious! I'll definitely have to stop by this place the next time I'm in Cave Creek or North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I am on the fence with this one.  While the atmosphere is relaxed and fun (who wouldn't like that retro gas station ambiance?) and the service was quick and friendly, the food is not enough to keep me coming back for more.  The outdoor seating is casual, with picnic benches and tables surrounding two 70's style gas pumps.  The setting offers a perfect view of the world going by on Cave Creek Road.  Dogs are welcome (yay!), and you will see plenty of furry friends enjoying the day.  The interior is small, but the space is used well with a few tables, and a small bar which also serves as the counter where orders are placed.    Looking forward to big juicy burgers, we chose: Big Earl Burger ($5.75) Bleu Burger ($6.99) Side of Onion Rings ($3.75) Vanilla Milkshake ($5.75)  The milkshake was by far the best item - thick and creamy.  However, at a price of $5.75 I was disappointed to see it came from a machine.  The burgers were OK - I enjoyed the ample bleu cheese on mine, but the beef patties were thinner than I expected.  The onion rings, while indeed greasy, were not the best I have tried.  That award hands-down goes to Rocket Burger.    On this visit, we had a 20% off coupon.  The woman who took our order seemed a bit confused by the math, and we ended up only receiving a 10% discount.  Shame on me for not catching it earlier, as the line when we left was very long and I did not want to wait to request a correction.  All in all, Big Earl's is a good place to sit outside and enjoy the view.  Maybe with a beer or two but not for the food."}
{"text":"Gross undercooked burger slathered with disgusting sauce and undercooked fries...all cold...for $12 with drink. Unbelievable! Neither was edible. Dumped it all after two bites. Praying I don't get sick. What a joke...how are theystill in business!?!?"}
{"text":"Cool spot, always awesome food, killer service and a solid beer selection. Dogs are welcome on the patio and always give my dog water. I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Veggie burger is YUMMY...I think it might be deep fried after they dip it in cajun seasoning (optional)...definitely one of the best I've had, but not one you'd want to eat a lot of (cuz of that deep fryin' awesomeness). They also had some sort of alcoholic shot that was delish. Shake and the fries definitely reminded me of 1980s McD's!  The atmosphere is casual...like a cross between a 50's diner and an outside biker bar. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees! Always bright happy faces every time I come in. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is great! I love the unique design of the old gas station turned restaurant. I definitely recommend the big kahuna chicken sandwich but I've never had a bad experience with anything I've ordered. :)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere!  Brooke was absolutely adorable!!   Charming little place with awesome memorabilia. We went and met a few of the regulars who couldn't have been friendlier. Dog friendly patio is always a plus, especially when it's so beautiful outside. Located among super cute shops all in walking distance.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Never been here before. Will probably not return. Food came cold. Wasn't what I asked for. They shut down the restaurant so they could film leaving patrons without adequate service, no refills, no condemned. Good tasted good....just to bad the temperature and service left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I have ate here several times since moving to Cave Creek. Always good food. I enjoy the laid back open concept however is a bit uncomfortable during the summer since it's mostly outdoor seating. A little pricey but still worth it. So many options to add to your burger or sandwich. Everyone is always nice. I keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped inon Friday morning for breakfast. Scrambled eggs with kale was excellent as was the two eggs with cheese and bacon on an English muffin. Service was great atmosphere was excellent and the waitstaff was exceptional."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because of the name, but I am glad that I did.  The burgers are fantastic.  The fries are great too.  The staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Breakfast breakfast all the way. Deep fried French toast and sunny side up eggs. Coffees always fresh and hot. The service is high energy and fun. I'm JD and I approve this message."}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I've had. Perfectly greasy, very tasty. The Cajun fries are excellent. Really solid beer selection. The environment is great. Really glad we made this part of our trip."}
{"text":"What a fun spot! It looks like a great place for a burger and a shake, but we stopped in for breakfast. Had a wonderful breakfast burrito (something we don't really have here in Texas, and the only improvement I would have made would be to add some hot peppers and cilantro). It was the \"Machaca Burrito\" ($4.95, grilled beef with onions, peppers and eggs in a flour tortilla). The salsa that came on the side wasn't much, but the burrito was great.  The prices here are great. I don't know when I'll be in Cave Creek again, but I'd love to come back."}
{"text":"If you want a big ol tastely cheesburger this is your place. Brings back memories from when I was a kid love this place for a meal cheat day for sure."}
{"text":"I come back to this place every single time I am in Phoenix to visit. We LOVE it. My boyfriend is vegetarian he LOVES the blackened veggie burger and I enjoy the blackened chicken sandwich! Omg! Everything from the environment to the food is amazing. Love that you have doggie water bowls too! Seriously. I am a server myself and from Colorado and would love to work here if I ever moved to Arizona! The staff is always cleaning something, friendly and the misters are genius! Live this place! You have a great establishment! 100%!"}
{"text":"Kinda pricy, but the food is decent and the service great. If you haven't had one of their thick milkshakes or malts, you haven't lived."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! I love Big Earl's so much. I just tried it for the 1st time and had a Cheddar cheese burger with green chile and it was amazing. I called 3 family members after to tell them and left messages on 2 of my friend's phones. I love spreading the word about amazing foods that needs to stick around :)"}
{"text":"Oh biscuits and gravy, how I love thee.  After a night out line dancing, watching bullriding, and watching cowboys; we needed some hangover food.  This is was just the remedy.    A tiny little old timey diner, with vintage gas pumps outside it's adorable.  I'm confused by the two stripper poles though.  We were there in the morning, so I'm not sure what the heck those are used for. ;)  I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy and a side of bacon. The biscuits were light and the sausage gravy was delicious. Nice and peppery and thick. Yum. The bacon was extra crispy/near burnt per my request.  I *do* wish they served Coke rather than Pepsi products, however.  I was very jealous of another person's chicken fried steak and will be ordering that next time.  A friend of mine ordered pancakes and declared it the best one she'd ever had.    Service was fast and friendly.    They must be a night place as well being as how they served beer and wine as well.  Perhaps that's why there are stripper poles?"}
{"text":"The burgers are great.  Just look for the old gas station with the red awning.  We enjoyed the music too."}
{"text":"I was doing errands, and decided to stop for breakfast. I asked the girl at the register what was good. She suggested the egg sandwich.  I had mine made with hash browns, bacon, and of course, eggs, on sour dough. I also had a cup of coffee, to wash it down.  The sandwich came to my table in a short time. The sour dough bread was perfectly toasted, with lots of butter. My first bite,  surprised me, how hot everything was. The hash browns were crispy, the bacon was also crispy. The eggs were cooked to perfection. Bottom line. It was killer!  The staff are very friendly, and up beat. The place is always clean, as are the restrooms.  Thanks again for another great meal."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend. We went with another couple and sat on the patio after ordering. This place is fun because it's an old gas station, complete with gas pumps and memorabilia. The employees were very friendly and the food was really good! I ordered a chocolate shake with Kahlua in it, really good!  They have a full bar for being a small place. The burgers and fries were good."}
{"text":"Went here after a very long off-roading trip with some of my friends, and we all enjoyed our meals. I don't remember what kind of burger I got, but it was really good. They have this coffee milkshake/malt that is absolutely to die for! They even asked if we wanted some of the coffee grounds in there and it was so good! The people there were really happy and fun to talk to; it seemed like they really enjoyed working there. The ambiance was very nice and fun. Great place to stop if you're in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"First time back since new owner...she was super friendly and the kids loved their burgers.  Dad was happy with an IPA."}
{"text":"Always my first stop when I come into the Carefree/ Cave Creek area. Very cool little place!   Great food and friendly people."}
{"text":"We passed this place on the way to Carefree.  Looked fun so we turned around and when in for lunch.  GREAT MOVE.   The staff is upbeat and fun. We had burger and fries.  One of the best we have had.  Service was not only great but fast.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Food is tasty and a good value. Don't let the name fool you, not everything on the menu is greasy. Wish they had a little more indoor seating so one could avoid the flies and the heat, but I guess that is part of the restaurant's character."}
{"text":"Very happy I chose this place today for lunch. Very very friendly staff and a pretty darn good Burger! The french fries are not that great but that's alright that's why they got four stars instead of five, but I will definitely return for another one of these delicious burgers and wonderful service. I like to set up and the atmosphere also. Great quick stop for Cave Creek. Will definitely recommend to friends."}
{"text":"OMG SO good!! The food is amazing. Breakfast burritos are killer! All different kinds of burgers which is the best part.. Never gets old!! Great beer selection. Owner works in the place which is hard to come by nowadays!! And she's hot!!"}
{"text":"Yosemite Sam Look Alike, Big Earl,& his Greasy Eats weren't Greasy actually, But he kinda was.This place is a Hoot!!!A converted Old Gas Station, lots of Local Characters with Great Character. They even had a great Veggie Burger for me,as well as Great Angus Burgers,Fries,and the BEST Malts we have ever had- you could taste fresh Vanilla Bean.Maltamania these Malts are some kinda Nirvana Drug!!!Chat it up with the Local Color while you wait for your Custom Order to come up. You get the feel you are in the Best of the Ol' Wild West here, Dig On In, Like A Thirsty Tic on a Puppy, because it just doesn't get better than this TRUE GRUB.Mosey on Over & grab ya some, not so Greasy as advertised, Greasy Eaten Lippity Smackitty Do Da"}
{"text":"I want to give 4 stars & I would have if there was just some needed upkeep and cleaning done to the place.  I really liked the set-up & I understand it's old and outside, which makes it tough to keep clean, but a little extra effort would go a long way.  That being said, burger was great, service was great...will definitely be back."}
{"text":"As this was the only place that was open til 12:00 and we were starving, they told us they were close and it was 11:30. Pretty lame since we had to drive to Phoenix (about an hour away) to get to the nearest 24 hour food restaurant. Thanks guys smh"}
{"text":"Delivers on it's promises. Great food with good size portions when you want some greasy eats. The place has LOTS of character!"}
{"text":"First time trying Big Earl's and was pleasantly surprised.  Don't come here for fancy ambiance because you will be disappointed.  Come here if you want to try good food in a VERY basic surroundings.  No frills and kept the garage theme inside. Minimal seating inside (4 tables) and plenty of outside seating available. Great customer service and attention to quality of food. We had breakfast The American and everything was cooked to order and was good flavor.  Coffee is also up to par with other restaurants.  Come on a sunshiny day and enjoy your experience."}
{"text":"Nice setting with converted gas station, friendly personnel and clientele, which  contributes to a nice atmosphere. Kids (we have 6) can be picky about food, but all of them liked their burgers, fries and shakes. So did we. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"You know I love this place. Who wouldn't love a place that has a white trash party. The Halloween party is off the charts too."}
{"text":"Loved it. Great fun vibe. Yummy burgers.  Good sweet potato fries and my friend had a peanut butter chocolate shake that was the best I've ever tasted.  Wish I didn't live so far from this place but will take my son.  Kids will love it."}
{"text":"This place looks divey but the food is surprisingly good! Both their breakfast and lunch are great. A must when in the cave creek area"}
{"text":"I have lived in Carefree for 7 years and always pass BE's, but I never stopped in. Since relatives are coming for a visit in September, I was seeking out a place for breakfast (too few around this area) so last Friday I dropped in after 7 AM and ordered pancakes and a small espresso shake. Holy Flapjacks, Batman! For $4.95 I got three humongous pancakes, fluffy and delish, and I almost died in pleasure with the shake. I couldn't even finish the pancakes (which were provided with real butter and maple syrup). I went back the next day to check out the hamburgers. I got the mushroom and Swiss (no mayo), fries, and a LARGE espresso shake. The fries rival McD's, and the burger was very good. Both times the service was wonderful, and I always give a 20% tip. I ate on the patio both times. Much hotter during lunch (obviously), but nice ambience except for the LOUD noise of passing traffic. All in all, A place I would definitely take my family to experience something unusual and cool as opposed to restaurants and chains."}
{"text":"I've been here at least a dozen times in the past two years. I have yet to notice a single problem in terms of their food. The complaint about the meat being frozen and overcooked, I don't know who was cooking when you went there. The patties are always thick & juicy and way more fresh than you would find at any burger chain.  They have great variety with the burgers or chicken sandwiches. Big Kahuna burger, Bleu Buffalo chicken sandwich, and Mushroom Swiss burger are my top three picks. They have a corn dog special that is priced great and tastes even better. Salads, hot dogs, burritos you name it.  Breakfast items are out of this world good. French toast and biscuits & gravy A+  I suggest trying Earls special sauce, it's a black pepper type mayo that is divine. Also their salsa verde is equally delicious.  For the price, it's more than your dollar menu obviously, but you pay for the quality and in my opinion it could be even more expensive. They don't have a huge seating area, I usually order take out and bring the food home. I've eaten dinner inside one weeknight and it seems to only get busy on weekends. Breakfast is a different story, sitting out outside several times in the a.m. was very peaceful.  The time it takes to get your meal is average, there is one cook most of the time so I don't expect fast food assembly line service."}
{"text":"What a delicious burger! The new owner has really done a great job improving the food at Big Earls. It was one of the best burgers I have ever had. The fries were great too!"}
{"text":"Way over rated.  Burger tasted like it was cooked on a grill that hadn't been cleaned since the gas station closed.  Fries were worst example of cheapest they could buy from a Wholesaler."}
{"text":"If you have never been to downtown Cave Creek it's time to do.  I was doing some shopping and Big Earls was a nice stop for lunch. It's a converted gas station and local hangout for a greasy burger and fries.  My burger was excellent.  The onion rings were okay when compared to Pinks in Hollywood being the best.   Still a solid lunch with 50's music and great service.  I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Been going here for years! Love it! Cool that an old gas station was converted to a restaurant. Sand volleyball in the back and nice patio. Cheeseburgers, Cajun fries and milkshakes rock! Kiddo does love chicken here as well. A destination if you are in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"I have not tried their food, but in the middle of stuffy Cave Creek with the well-to-do (possibley the owner of this fine establishment belongs to this social demographic?) I was presented with the STRONGEST and most delicious quad-shot, 32 Oz espresso drink I've ever had.  So totally did not expect to find that here.  The staff was nice and friendly, but with a \"don't fuck with me or I will hand you your ass\" edge...  Very awesome.  The restaurant is fucking killer , I love the design and feel of it.  Going inside is like walking inside your dad's garagewhile he's working on his hot rod,  and sharing a sandwich with him.  My kid loved it too, probably cause the lady behind the counter slid her a mammoth sized chocolate milk topped with whipped cream."}
{"text":"OK but generally disappointment.  Cold winter day.  Not much seating inside but luckily we got some.  Not much variety in menu.  We would have walked out but were hungry so instead we split a patty melt and fries since we knew we going to get something that tasted better later.  Just didn't do it for us."}
{"text":"My husband asked me to write this review. He always orders the Kobe burger whenever it's available, so that's what he ordered here. Said it was the worst Kobe burger he's ever had. Edible, but didn't even taste like Kobe meat. He said it seemed more like one of those frozen shaped patties. Perhaps other food is good here, so this review is strictly for their Kobe burger. I hate leaving bad reviews for my local places, so perhaps we will come back and try something different, and I'll update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Decent food and the prices are pretty good. We went a few times but it's really not worth the drive without a groupon.  Too many restaurants in town that make a better burger."}
{"text":"For a place that puts greasy in its name we thought the hamburgers lacked the required amount of grease.  I had a Big Earl with green chile and onion rings and hubby had one with bacon, egg and sweet potato fries.  The burgers and fries were ok.  The star of the meal was the onion rings - if I was reviewing them for these alone it would 5 star.  I would come back if I was in Carefree looking for a hamburger, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.  I was so hoping for a great greasy burger.  I did love the gas station converted to hamburger stand look though!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat here since my wife and I moved to Cave Creek, and we finally made it in. The burgers were great, the staff was incredibly friendly and the atmosphere was fantastic. Overall we had an amazing time, and we will definitely be back.  The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because our fries were soggy, but hey, they were still fries, and thats not why we went there. Great experience, and I would recommend this place to all.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The worst place to eat in Cave Creek The staff are a bunch of checked out, rude and entitled young people. The food is horribly inconsistent. .. You are often given overcooked burned burgers or worse undercooked raw chicken.... If you complain and ask them to correct the food they argue with you and are extremely rude! They have zero interest in customer satisfaction ...."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they have opened and have never had a bad meal. Whether it's a burger, grilled cheese or a salad, they always hit a 'home run.'  If you want white table cloths, and need a constantly filled water glass you can stay away. However, if you want a good burger, fresh French fries, and a fantastic shake, head to Big Earl's."}
{"text":"Weird restaurant with flavorless food. Serving $5 burgers/sandwiches for $9. Good came out cold and we were the only table. Wasted $44 on 3 adult sandwiches and 2 kids meals with one fries."}
{"text":"The people are nice the food is great my favorite is the grilled cheese and fries  They Also allow Dogs on their back patio not sure if anyone knows that because I never see any there"}
{"text":"Great comfort food in a fun environment! The line can get a little long, but if you know that going in, it isn't horrible.  We love Big Earl's!"}
{"text":"Our boy is on fall break , so why not a small roadie to beautiful Cave Creek !  Earls came highly recommended by locals and friends . I had the Black and Bleu , and boy was that a tasty burger ! The Harris Ranch beef was incredible . Just enough fat to give right flavor and was seasoned perfectly . One of the best burgers I've ever had !  The boy had a Big Earl cheddar KPMustard , and he gobbled it down and was happy . Would definitely show my face in that restaurant again and again . Old gas station vibe decor was really cool , some time was put into the presentation of the property . The food speaks for it self in Aces"}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast so this review is based on that.  Also I've only tried two things on their menu at breakfast.  Chicken fried steak and the breakfast burrito.  I would recommend both and would say try the burrito on your first visit.  I like bacon eggs and cheese.  Best part is their salsa they give with it sooo good.  Besides that big earls has the type of home town feel you want when you walk into a breakfast place solo.  A smile and a friendly what can I get you.  The chef there is super friendly often times brings my food out to me directly.  He also told me about the Indian fry bread place down the street and their spinach enchiladas which are so good as well.  Bottom line big earls is hometown, down to earth and exactly what you would expect to get when you walk in and I love it.  Cheers guys!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Cave Creek! We love the BBQ burger and Big kahuna chicken sandwich. You can't beat the unique atmosphere and friendly staff. Highly recommend Big Earls !!   The chicken fried steak for breakfast is a must. Pictured below."}
{"text":"Took a group of about 15 here on our way back into Phoenix from Seven Springs and had a great time.  The burgers are phenomenal.  The fries and shake I got are on par, but the burgers really are fantastic.    The venue is very inviting and open, with a really fun sand volleyball court in the back that we took full advantage of.  It did help that it was also about 75 degrees with a slight breeze.  Just a perfect day, and a great little joint to grab a burger done the right way.  I would recommend this place to anyone rolling through Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Great area...Great food...Great staff. Stop by and support Cave Creek and the Southwest. We need this community now more than ever."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch in Cave Creek. We came up on Sunday to explore the general area (which is a blast on the weekends if you haven't tried it yet - lots of bikers and bars). The line was out the door, but the old fashioned style burgers and chocolate malt were well worth the wait. They also have free wifi..."}
{"text":"Loved this place with lots of local color, great eats, superb service from Brooke and the rest of the staff......AND.....spotless bathrooms."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great atmosphere! Professional service!! One of my favorite places in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here with my brothers and we had a good time.  Food was good and it was fun sitting outside.  Tables by the street, and Cave Creek Road is at a crawl through there so it isn't stressful having cars whiz by. The decor is entertaining, and we enjoyed the photo prop they had there you can stick your head through.  Had a decent cup of java and a breakfast burrito.  Sign out front is very interesting retro look, and the whole place is  fifties cool as befits the ex-gas station theme.  Lot's of interesting stuff on the walls inside while you stand around placing your order."}
{"text":"The best part of Big Earl's is the atmosphere. The place has a ton of personality.  The burgers are solid - we had the Big Earl, the Kobe and the spicy Blue. Long with fries, tater toros and fried Mac and cheese - all good.  The service was also very good!"}
{"text":"Always great. Just wish the girl who worked there Talia still worked there. She was great. This is a classic and a must eat at for everyone visiting the cave creek area"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this place is really good. Best burger I've had in a long time. Only downside is the flies because it mostly outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Man... this was a great burger. I had the BBQ burger and it was awesome. First time here and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Having eaten here awhile back, we thought we would try it on New Years Day. I am sorry to report it was very disappointing.  We think this place is an icon and wish we could give a better review.   I ordered the bacon and blue salad with grilled chicken and dressing on the side.  The salad was served on a bed of romaine lettuce with blue cheese sprinkles four wedges of an unripe tomato that tasted like chlorine and not a speck of bacon!  The grilled chicken breast was way overcooked.  Besides no flavor or moisture, it was very difficult to chew.  After being advised there was no bacon on the salad, the waitress brought some bacon to the table to put on the salad.  Unfortunately, the salad was so bland and unpalatable, I was unable to eat more than a few bites.   Hubs ordered a burger and tator tots.  It was okay.  The burger was on the small side but it's hard to screw up a burger!  The tots were marginal.  We also ordered fries and they were okay.   No one ever checked back with us regarding the meal.  We won't be returning here again. There are too many other good options in CC that we will spend our $ at in the future.  Sorry.  We were really hoping for a better experience and a place to return to."}
{"text":"Big Earl's is by far the best burger restaurant to go to in Arizona. I absolutely love the Big Earl Burger and all of the adult milkshakes! The restaurant  was so inviting and SO clean!  Upon walking into the restaurant I was greeted by the cutest and friendliest girls, Lilly and Avalon. They were so sweet and happily continued to check in on my boyfriend and I as we ate. Another plus is that the patio is pup friendly so my dog was able to come enjoy the cave creek ambiance with us! Will DEFINITELY be back for more great food and great service."}
{"text":"I'd heard some good things, and my brother had been here a few times. I was entirely disappointed.  I went with my husband and daughter because I remembered it while we were looking for somewhere for a burger or sandwich.  Looks nice enough from the outside but inside is tiny and the floor was soaked by the soda machine.  Ok. Overlooking that.  It was our first time there, so I didn't know what to expect. I know I didn't expect zero quality customer service. I ordered a sandwich for myself and a burger for my husband while he got the stroller out of the car because there are no high chairs or booster seats (again, ok, overlooking). I wanted to ask if the \"kidz\" grilled cheese was smaller than a normal sandwich but chickened out under the \"omg hurry up, woman\" look I was getting from the girl behind the counter. She gave me the total, I said ok, and my husband stepped forward to pay.  She walked away from us.  She took some guy's drink order and discussed what went into it while we filled our soda cups. Like I said, it was our first time here...because she just walked away and left us there we weren't sure if we were actually supposed to pay then or after. Eventually we asked and got her attention long enough to pay.  Went outside to the patio to wait. My husband went through two chairs before finding one that wasn't broken or ripped.  When our food came out, she plopped it on the table and walked away. I swear she didn't even look at us. I know she didn't say anything to us. My husband's burger he said was pretty good. My chicken sandwich was pretty standard. Want friendly service or anyone who cares? Not your place. Maybe if you hang out at the bar. The one staff member we interacted with seemed perfectly amiable while pouring a drink.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Visiting for the week from San Diego and we couldn't get enough of this place. Awesome burgers and beer selection. We loved everything we tried!"}
{"text":"Delicious burger and shake! I highly recommend it! It was a bit chilly sitting outside but they had a couple heaters to keep us warm."}
{"text":"I like this place. If you are looking for a good quick hamburger, hot dog or fries; this is the place. This reminds me of the drive-ins we use to frequent as youngsters. The service was fast and friendly. This is a dog friendly place. Nice to have one with so few around."}
{"text":"Fun place and sweet staff.  I wasn't liquored up with fireball and was here for a child's birthday party----so I stayed off the stripper poles.  Food was tasty but portions were small, hence the four out of five stars. Beautiful location."}
{"text":"We love Big Earls!  Great food in a great casual setting.  One of my favorite places to have breakfast in Cave Creek!   Big Earls also has some fun events to attend throughout the year- I've been here during the Wicked Pub Crawl, for their annual White Trash Bash and its a great seat for different parades the town of Cave Creek puts on!  If your in the area...you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I ordered the blackened chicken sandwich, no mayo, and I got mayo sandwich with a side of chicken. Portions are small.   The venue is cool, but the food is not good."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Great greasy foods. Milkshake was amazing. Outdoor seating. Volleyball court is nice."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Pretty average burger. The milkshakes, beer, and tatertots were really great though! The staff was also super friendly! They have events which I'll definitely have to check out soon!"}
{"text":"If you would like an order of FLIES...that is not a typo...with your burger, this place has got you covered.  There were way too many flies and inside there were other crawling bugs that fall from the ceiling.  It was truly a mistake to go here and we should have taken our food to go. But the food isn't even anything spectacular. You can get this type of food anywhere else in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good food had the egg sandwich"}
{"text":"I tend to agree with Shannon M. I thought the idea was great and definitely a cool place to stop but the food was nothing to boast about. Pretty average. They did have a good beer list and I was able to grab a Nitro Milk Stout and my guy an IPA. We brought a couple friends for a ride during bike week on a Saturday so I don't know if that's why it was so crowded but the line to order was really long. We all got burgers and fries. Pretty generous portions and there luckily were a lot of tables so we had no problem finding a place to sit. The atmosphere was great as we got to \"bike watch\" (when you like bikes more than people) and even caught the notorious Cave Creek sports car display. No one minds watching a 911, R8 and Ferrari pull in.  (wipes drool off lip) So overall this is a great place to take in some lunch on the weekend. I'd go back again if we rode up that way and see what else is on the menu that I might like."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and its not bad if you are seeking a hamburger in a cute setting and you want to sit outside ad you have a dog with you. The burgers are nothing to brag about decent size and sweet potato fries were a bit overcooked and just your typical frozen fries. Service is pleasant but very slow for the food to come out."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast burritos. Nice staff. Sweet owner whom always strives to exceed your expectations. Great place for Cave Creek."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS IN PHOENIX AREA! Always great to people watch in Cave Creek, and Big Earls gives you a front row seat on it's (dog friendly) patio. The best burgers come from the best ingredients. And Big Earls delivers. I have been bringing my kids here since they were little for their cheeseburgers and fantastic biscuits and gravy. Their patty melt is also out of this world because they actually know how to caramelize onions. Not just grilled onions...caramelized. And the rye bread! Oh so good!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was alright here, with pancakes being the highlight.  Biscuits were firm and dry.  Staff was somewhat polite, but after ordering I didn't see from them again (is this full service place or not?).  Little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"The burger was unimaginative. The bun weird ~ can we try Brioche?  The  fries were yummy.  The boozy milkshake was beyond amazing!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting friends in \"the crick\" last month, after late night  and too many cold favorites we couldn't pass up a place with a name like Big Earl's Greasy Eats. I had the machaca and egg burrito with green chilies, on word \"AWESOME'!  This place is not lacking in atmosphere originally was a gas station (i think), retro diner feel, outdoor bathroom, cool tattooed short order grill \"chick\", I felt like I was on the set of a Quentin Tarantino shoot! I will definitely make a stop at Big Earl's on next trip to the Crick! Thanks Earl!"}
