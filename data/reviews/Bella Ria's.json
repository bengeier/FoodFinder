{"text":"+ corned beef hash: 9/10 + pretty good variety of toasts and cheeses + coffee: 8/10 (possibly lavazza) + service: on point 10/10 bonus: no lines! and they have a vaporwave bev fridge."}
{"text":"Have only been for breakfast...But easily one of the best breakfast places I have tried in Pittsburgh....The pittsburgher breakfast sandwich is amazing...Friendly staff, and great prices"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Bella Ria! I was skeptical at first based on the building. However, our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and specials. I ordered spaghetti with meatballs and also had a salad. The salad was standard, but the spaghetti and meatballs were delicious. I really enjoyed our experience. As others said a really well done traditional Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Small and quaint. Great service. The chef even made me a special off the menu Cuban sandwich, which was surprisingly awesome.  I'd definitely give this joint another shot."}
{"text":"Breakfast and dinners always terrific steaks are better than outback Longhorns etc. first class servers the ice tea is fresh and best I ever had highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. A true hole in the wall that serves really excellent food. I never would have guessed.   I had the eggplant: it was excellent. The desserts, the bread, etc. I'll be coming back again without doubt."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good.  I dont think I have ever had a bad meal there, and their desserts are fabulous!  Their hours are a little wonky, and even though they say they open at 7am often they are just walking in the door to open at 7am."}
{"text":"Service can be a little iffy but completely understandable considering the breakfast crowd and only 2 to 3 wait staff, but so far this place has got to have one of the best breakfasts around.  Get there early to get a seat"}
{"text":"We've been trying to get here for some time now and finally made time on a Friday afternoon. Absolutely zero frills inside the restaurant, which is what I expected really.  One server which caused us to wait a little bit for him to bus the table, but he was running around and answering the phone so we couldn't blame him.  I went with the \"Royale with Cheese\" which isn't really like a Big Mac, but better. Fried onions and crispy bacon set it off.  My wife had a side salad and the wedding soup, both of which she enjoyed.  I like the fact they had about 5 daily specials, even though I didn't try them. Will definitely be back to try some of the dinner specials I've read about from other Yelpers."}
{"text":"Had a friend that previously worked there and he convinced me to stop in for breakfast. It was delicious! I will definitely be stopping in again."}
{"text":"Extraordinary friendly service from cute waitress. Food was very good. Homemade desserts.  In addition to traditional Italian entrees they also had burgers, crab cakes and opened at 7 am for breakfast.  Hidden gem, up until now I had been unimpressed with restaurants in the north hills."}
{"text":"So great! Must try their wings and the daily specials"}
{"text":"Great food - fresh made Italian American food, wonderful service.   Very clean friendly place"}
{"text":"I met up with a couple friends for dinner while visiting Pittsburgh and we chose this place because of the great reviews. The place is not quite what you expect as it looks more like a diner, but the food is delicious and the service is with a smile.  I was seated immediately after walking in and the place was almost full of people enjoying their meals. They have a variety of items to choose from, not just pastas, all reasonably priced. I ended up selecting one of their specials - house made baby back ribs with seasonal veggies and red skin mash potatoes - how could I say no to that?! It also came with a side salad with a housemade balsamic, and all for $16.50. The ribs were meaty and fall off the bone with an excellent rub.  I didn't get a chance to try some of their desserts because I was stuffed so will have to stop by again."}
{"text":"I have been here for breakfast many years ago and tried the Royale Burger a few years ago. For some reason, every time we think to come here, it's a Sunday and they're closed. In fact, the one Sunday, we ran into the owner and he said that his wife told him if he ever opens on Sunday's, she's divorcing him. Ahhhhh the lives of small business owners.   Tonight I tried the Veal Parmesan with penne pasta and a side salad with homemade Italian dressing. The veal was crisp, the marinara light and the cheese gooey. Very delicious!   We loved the warm garlic bread with fresh Parmesan in top. It was so delicious and warm with a very light crisp.   The desserts were very good too - a berry crisp and a coconut cream pie! The coconut cream pie had toasted coconut all over the top. Super good!   I like that it's a casual place with lots of returning customers. They close early - 9pm on Friday and Saturday."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is amazing. Very family friendly. The catering is the best around. I have used on many occasions. The chicken Marsala can not be beat!"}
{"text":"This is a go to place for us. The food is fantastic and fairly priced and for us it's extremely conveniently located."}
{"text":"The meal was good. just what we need for a Friday night. It was a little off putting when the waitress made a face when my girlfriend ordered a shirly temple. The food was good. Later our waitress started paying all her attention to a party of eight and no more for us. We had to get another server to help us end our time there. Trust me they were not very busy at the time. With so many other options in the area we don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"We eat here often. Can never go wrong with any of the specials and the soup is top notch."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and have never been disappointed.  Although it is small, they have a varied menu. A good spot for anything from a burger to veal parm. Try the soups."}
{"text":"I had a hearty steak, potato and egg breakfast dish. The customers that came in knew the server by his first name. Clean interior, but not fancy. A good local place."}
{"text":"Get the dinners, any of the specials, and the pizza and you cannot go wrong. The sandwiches are good, but that's not where the magic lies. Almost everything is made from scratch and you'd be amazed at what the kitchen can make. Make sure you don't overeat so you can have leftovers and be able to get dessert!  It's BYOB and no money has been wasted cleaning up the interior, it's a bit run down. They could easily go to downtown or Lawrenceville   and be all fancy and up their prices by 50% and I'd still go with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"It's delicious!!! This place looks like it might be a dive joint, but it's clean with nice friendly staff, ample seating and delicious food. Now we only ate sandwiches, but my reuben sandwich was just SO good and HUGE, way too much food for one sitting. I read fellow yelpper reviews and thank you yelp, for recommending this place..I thought I should too!  Stop in Pittsburgh, DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"Only open for dinner on Saturdays now but food is really good. Make reservations. Open for breakfast and lunch. Have new Expresso and cappuccino machine for coffee drinks. Great desserts all made in house. Good specials. Byob with nice wine glasses. Recommended."}
{"text":"Average diner food in an bland decorated building connected to a beer distributor."}
{"text":"Awful; from the outside in. Decor is AWFUL, service nonexistent. Pricing is higher than the quality deserves. The WORST fish sandwich in Pittsburgh served with the WORST side of chips EVER, not one whole chip, all broken pieces and small broken pieces. Pasta WAY overpriced at $15."}
{"text":"Place: It was our first time here in general; my wife and I went on a Thursday night for dinner. My first impression of the joint was mediocre (diner-like, radio blaring, unimpressive) but not surprising based on other reviews. The place was bumping. Only one waitress was working so she was busy serving all the tables and manning the register. She was friendly and helpful when available.  Food: I got the chipotle pork loin special with red skin mashed potatoes, vegetables, and a salad for $18. It was excellent. My wife got spaghetti (angel hair) and meatballs which was also very good. Everything tasted homemade and had great flavor. The waitress gave us two rounds of garlic bread which tasted awesome (better than most fancy italian restaurants)! Also, we got conolli to go and haven't tried it yet, but it looks delectable.  Overall: The service and size of the salad that came with our meal was mediocre. However, the cost, quality, quantity, and flavor of the food overall was great! I recommend this restaurant and look forward to trying other meals here."}
{"text":"Was recommended to come here. Very disappointed the place had an odd smell. While waiting to get a menu overheard the worker talk to a customer on the phone who was complaining. The menus were dirty. The pop tasted funny. And one of our drinks had a lemon seed in the bottom(which we did not have any drinks that had lemon). Watched stink bugs crawl up the windows which the ledges were dirty. The thing that made us get our food Togo was a worker came out into the dinning room and placed a cutting board up against the wall on a booth. That is not sanitary whether or it was going to be used or it was dirty and needed to be clean. I will not be returning to there."}
{"text":"I drive past here on a daily basis and finally made a decision  to stop in for dinner.  I always heard it is a favorite spot of  the local residents and knew at some point I had to try it for myself. Coincidently, as we were being seated, I saw we were next to a signed picture of Kevin Glavin, a well known opera singer. Apparently, he is a regular customer when he is in the area and the  inscription on his picture read\" One of Pittsburgh's Best Kept Secrets\". Bella Ria's had plenty of dinner specials to choose from and the regular menu looked pretty decent as well. It was almost impossible to make a decision! I chose the sirloin and crab cake and my friend decided on the red snapper special.  Both were served with a fresh tasting salad, steamed vegetables and a mashed red potato.  I like that the word homemade is used frequently . Which includes their dressings, soups and best of all.....homemade desserts!  The dining room is simple yet comfortable. Our server was very attentive and she was able to keep up with her other tables without skipping a beat.   We were very pleased with our dining experience and look forward to trying the beef brisket that is made in house. In fact, it  certainly wasn't hard to figure out from the thick aroma that a batch was cooking tonight and will be tomorrows feature.  Note:  Bella Ria's does not serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing down to the garlic bread.  Sweet and spicy wings were awesome, sweet first and a little kick of spice at the end. Literally the best wing sauce."}
{"text":"Small, diner-style restaurant next to beer distributor. Looks like a dump, but good god this place is incredible. Amazing breakfast. Amazing dinner. Amazi.. You get the point.  5/5 clams and special \"TV Recognition Award\" for best breakfast food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Seriously. I can't say enough about how good everything is. I have lived in the area for nearly ten years, and am extraordinarily embarrassed and disappointed that I have not been here before today. The wings are very well made - fried just right so they're crispy outside and still juicy. The Royale with cheese is AMAZING. Get it with fries. Mine were fresh-out-of-the-fryer hot and crispy. My wife got the bacon wrapped pork chop special, which had a sweet and smokey bourbon glaze. As good as my burger was.... The special was even better! The iced tea is home brewed. In fact, damn near all of the food is home/hand made. Even the burger patty was handmade!   The atmosphere is very relaxed, which I love. It's a great go-to kind of place. Really wish I had found it sooner, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night with my fiance for dinner.  I have been by this place many times before as it sits right near the entrance to my old high school stadium where I still run quite a bit and somehow I have never though to go here.  That's probably because it really isn't much to look at from the outside and it shares the building with a beer distributor on the other side.  Anyways, I was looking at Yelp the other day and saw someone post some good things about it and decided, man, I should probably head there.  So my fiance and I decided to walk in not really knowing what to expect.  The inside is a decent looking space with 8 tables (I counted because there was one waitress) and then a counter.  Its only problem being that it looks very dated, like it was probably put in about 30 years ago dated. That's not to say it was too bad since it still looked and felt clean.  Above the counter there is also a TV which had both the Pirates game and then preseason Steelers game on it while we there.    For dinner I decided to go with one of there specials for the evening and ordered the bourbon bbq bacon pork chop which came with potato pancakes and a salad.  Whenever I asked if they had a vinaigrette, the server actually gave me a choice of three from which I chose the balsamic.  Before our salads came to the table our waitress brought us some bread which looked to be covered in some sort of oil and covered in cheese.  It was excellent as the oil had some garlic in it and the bread was a little crispy.  We ended up eating it all up before our salads came and our waitress asked if we wanted some more with our dinner which we readily agreed to.  Our salads weren't bad as they had some darker looking lettuce and none of the iceberg that you normally find.  They also were topped with onions, tomato and olives.  The overall taste of them wasn't too bad although I thought that my vinaigrette was a bit sweet.  After we finished our salads our meals were brought out.  My pork chop was thick but not very large, wrapped in bacon and had the BBQ sauce on top as promised.  The potato pancakes were also on the plate as well as some carrots and broccoli which was a surprise to me since they weren't mentioned.  I will admit that I don't like cooked carrots much so I won't really comment on them but the broccoli was decent and tasted a little of butter.  My potato pancakes were surprisingly good as they had some spices in them that made them interesting and actually made me regret getting some sour cream with them since it covered up the flavor a bit.  Finally my pork chop was also pretty good.  I could really taste the sweetness of the bourbon in the BBQ sauce and it went great with the saltiness of the bacon.  My pork chop was also cooked pretty well although some of it was a bit dry.  Overall though it was a successful meal.  I have to admit that I was also very impressed with the waitress as she was waiting on seven tables at a time and never really seemed to be in the weeds.  Granted everyone straggled in at different times but I still found it to be impressive.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My only real complaint with Bella Ria's is that I think we paid a little much for what we ended up getting ($17 for the special I think).  Even so, I did enjoy my meal and know that my fiance did as well."}
{"text":"I've lived in the neighborhood for a little under two years and finally enjoyed food from Bella Ria's. Located just north of Observatory Hill on Perrysville Avenue, Bella Ria's is a family owned business serving some really great Italian eats. My boyfriend and I were in the mood for a pizza, so I placed a to-go order by phone. I was told the wait would be approximately 30 minutes. I arrived a little earlier to find the pizza already finished and waiting for me to pick up. The interior and exterior of Bella Ria's isn't exactly welcoming, so if you're looking for a fresh looking space, this isn't it. However, they make up for their lack of decor in the food. We both really, really enjoyed the pizza. All of the ingredients, including the crust were cooked to perfection.  We'll definitely order again from Bella Ria's in the future and (perhaps) dine at the restaurants instead of taking out."}
{"text":"Nice Traditional Italian flavor. Loved our meal."}
{"text":"A lot of people really enjoy it, but every time I have been the food has been just ok. Servers are very nice and usually backlogged, but maintain efficiency."}
{"text":"I've had just about everything on the menu.  Standouts:  their breakfast sandwiches are fantastic, the soup is usually good, and the bruschetta salad is amazing.  Burgers are really good too.  Their dinner daily specials are almost always solid though pricey (around $16).  The place is small, and is generally packed at dinner time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I've been in Pittsburgh for 6 months and this place has the best meatball sandwich I've had here!  Well done!!"}
{"text":"Love Bella Ria's!!!!!   Amazing food!  And the desserts are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I ate hear the other night. We had heard good things about Bella Ria's and decided to give it a shot. At first glance the outside of the building is a bit dumpy and the inside looks like a retro diner. *****just remember looks have nothing to do with the food and I am glad I did not get scarred off by the looks of the place***. The waitress was super friendly and brought menus over immediately. Waitress took drink orders and brought over some delicious bread. I had the chicken parmesan which came with ziti. I have to say the chicken parm was among the best I have ever had. I would definitely highly recommend Bella Ria's for your Italian food needs. You can be sure I will be going again and again. Be sure to never judge a book by its cover as you will definitely miss out on some top notch eats."}
{"text":"Wonderful, quiet, small hole in the wall restaurant. We had the pizza and the special black and blue steak. Amazing food perfectly cooked. The salad was amazing with mixed greens. The homemade soup was just as tasty! Peaceful atmosphere where we were given the service we needed and left to enjoy our meal. I look forward to trying them for breakfast someday!"}
{"text":"Small, but very clean. Not what you would expect from a local diner to be honest. It wasn't very busy, and was kind of awkwardly quiet inside. But the food was fantastic. The vegetable omelet couldn't have been fresher and not greasy at all. The only compliant would be they don't have any kind of fruit as a side. Oh well. We may or may not have brought our own."}
{"text":"First visit and wow ! I had the salad with homemade balsamic and it was one of the best I've ever had. Then I had the grilled pork - delicious ! The cannoli at the end was the perfect great. My husband had the lobster bisque, chicken parm and a butterfinger cheese cake - start to finish it was delicious. The tomato sauce is incredible fresh tasting. Definitely will be back !!"}
