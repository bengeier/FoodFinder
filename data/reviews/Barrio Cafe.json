{"text":"Probably the best tasting food at PHX. However, $9.00 for chips and salsa after I've already bought beer and appetizers is a bad, bad thing. There are enough negative reviews about this specific subject (read below) that the management should take notice and at least make chips and salsa complementary as long as the customer has purchased something."}
{"text":"had a $20 slow cooked pork dish (cochinito pibil) that was described as a house speciality.  Nothing special.  Salty, a little dry...lots of spices. Obvious sauce drips on plate rim were partially wiped off...made the plate look unapetizingly dirty at first.  The $7 Modelo tasted great!"}
{"text":"Best pork burrito I've ever had. Best airport meal ever! Hope to fly through PHX again just to get one!"}
{"text":"First time trying Barrio Cafe and so glad we did thanks to a long layover at Phoenix airport. The Paso Poblano tacos & burrito were both the best we've ever had!!! Moist and nicely seasoned chicken and sauce with goat cheese (no rice/beans) :). Far from the usual gut bomb at other Mexican restaurants. Of course it's on the pricey side but well worth it. Serves fresh coffee made in a French press. The caramel filled Churros made the perfect finishing touch! Great service too! Highly recommended. We'll definitely dine there again on our next trip... time permitting."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab a quick bite before flying back to LA.  Service here could hardly be described as quick here, nor could it be described as accurate.  I never did get my drink order that day; not even a glass of water."}
{"text":"Great place. I just got back from Mexico and ate the tacos there and I ordered the steak tacos here and it was the exact same. True, authentic stuff. Guacamole looked great and salsa was fresh. Only problem was the 9$ chips and salsa and 14$ for 3 tacos. But that's Sky Harbor airport for ya"}
{"text":"Very good food for the airport if you like spicy get the salsa, house ketchup, or the chorizo. The pick de gallo is really good too."}
{"text":"Pros: Not jam packed, service was quick and professional.  Cons: came here specifically for a bloody \"Maria\". Ordered a double (wife did too). Tasted good, but I'm pretty sure they gypped us on the alcohol as neither of us felt one bit different when we finished them. Thus the disappointing rating."}
{"text":"Did the right thing and checked Yelp before choosing.  No seating at first choice, so took a chance on the lesser option here.  What a mistake. Sub par service and sub par food.  Chips and salsa - chips were thick fried so hard i ripped my mouth up on them. Salsa was good, but salsa is very hard to screw up. $9. Ordered the spicy seasoned chicken sandwich. Bread wasn't fresh and required some shearing strength to complete the only bite i took.  Went looking for salvageable contents - chicken breast was thin sliced in half, no flavor. Bunch of onions that i carefully read the ingredients to avoid. Steak fries were cold. Spicy ketchup was the best thing on the plate.  I'm writing this review from next door at La Grande Orange where I'm enjoying the well reviewed Kale salad... Should have listened to my fellow Yelpers and saved $33 wasted next door."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were simply bad at any price but at $9.00 it was insulting. Plus the $18 glass of wine - what a rip-off. As a Phoencian, I'm ashamed that this is what's offered to visitors."}
{"text":"Had a friend recommend this place to me while I was in town on business.  He mentioned that Sky Harbor is attracting great chef-driven operations to place their restaurants in the airport.  But he thought I wouldn't be able to get to Barrio Cafe because it was only available behind the D Gates (Terminal 3) security check and I was going to Terminal 3, but was behind the US Airways security check (B Gates.)  I figured that sounded wrong, and had 3 hours to kill before my flight so I started exploring.  To my surprise, I found that I could make the long hike, and after about 30-45 minutes of horizontal escalators, a cappuccino from Cartel Coffee Lab, and a near-taco purchase at *another* place, a dude drove by on one of those people carriers and offered me a lift.  2 minutes later and I'm standing ten feet from Barrio.  First, had to wait about ten minutes to get a seat.  I could've sat immediately in the bar, but needed to do some work on the laptop.  Finally got a seat, and perused the menu.  It was short and sweet...and a bit expensive.  Average price around $15 for a plate of tacos, etc.  Specials over $20 each.  I order the Cochinita Pibil tacos with fries.    The tacos were amazing.  Two or three homemade corn tortillas around each helping of juicy pork.  They left the pork nude and let the arbol/sour marinade and slow-cook do the flavor work.  Then they top it with their pickled onions and a habanero sauce and pico de gallo,...or was the habanero inside the pico de gallo?  Either way it was hot, perfectly cooked juicy pork, and exploded with flavor.  They also give you this side of \"yellow\" salsa.  I try some of it on my 3rd bite.  Their chef knows what's up.  The yellow was a cooling agent, that basically cleanses the palate and cools your tongue for the next bite.  Balance and complexity like this is hard to find.   Three tacos later and I am fully satisfied and very impressed.  I couldn't finish the fries, but they were crispy, hot, and lightly salted with what I'd imagine was arbol powder or maybe just cayenne and salt? (I forget)  While the dish was expensive, the portions were generous and the quality was well worth it.  If this was the airport location, I can't wait to try their original storefront operation when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Lunch on a layover. Menu looked better than most airport fare. A little pricey but typical airport prices. I had the shrimp tacos. Good size shrimp with good spicy flavors. The salsa Verde was good as well. Pretty impressed for an airport. Service was good but a little slow in the beginning. I can imagine the actual downtown restaurant is quite good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for airport food - not only was the food good, the beer was tall for the price and the service was fast and very friendly.  Finally an airport restaurant where you leave feeling full and not ripped off!"}
{"text":"Crap wine selection served in dirty glasses. The food was good, but the dirty glass makes me wonder if the plate was even clean. Great fast service so I have to give them some credit."}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner there as I was passing through the Phoenix Airport.  The cafe is good, services very good and surpassed my expectations.  Food was good, definitely would go back again if I have the time as I make my connections.  Price was good, and as I have traveled many airports, it was reasonable, good portions.  I'll make there again."}
{"text":"Wow!  So impressive for airport food. I got shrimp quesadilla's (not what they are called on menu). Fantastic, gourmet, Mexican. Mmmmmm go there!"}
{"text":"They don't realize they are in an airport an people are in a hurry. Our waitress was constantly distracted with having to whip up fresh guacamole instead of serving her customers. 20 minutes for $15 tacos that I have to shove down my face in order to make my flight was not enjoyable."}
{"text":"We have been traveling all day, and all we wanted was a decent meal that wasn't fast food. We were going to wait until we got home, but when our flight was delayed, we couldn't wait.  We really didn't want airport food at all. We were pleasantly surprised! Quick service, lots of great flavor and filling. I had the pollo pablano and pasole. My husband had the pork tacos. It was definitely better than our expectations."}
{"text":"Good place to eat if you want fresh Mexican food! Disturbing scene yesterday with a bunch of grown men trying to bully the staff for cheap drinks.  Made an uncomfortable scene for other patrons.  Heard they were a bunch of rugby players..old rugby players! Just sad. One was actually pushing his finger into one of the staffs chest trying to intimidate him.  The staff handled it pretty well. The guy is lucky he didn't get arrested!! So as long as you don't have grown men being bullies and making a scene, it's a great place to kill time between flights!"}
{"text":"Wow... To have the same name of a great restaurant and deliver an experience that is subpar to say the least is an incredible let down. Expensive, cold and just disappointing."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar - good service. Had the steak tacos - pretty good. Draft beer - 20 oz. Total = $20. I left full and not broke in the airport. I'd go back."}
{"text":"For airport food, this was pretty decent. Ordered fish tacos and they brought me shrimp. Waitress felt bad and brought me two extra fish tacos, so I could taste them. AND AND they are hardly selfish with the avocado! I got over a 4th of an avocado on each taco. Do the math!   The waitress was helpful and extremely friendly.    And don't get me started on the margarita! Don Julio Cadillac Margarita, and MAN! It was RIGHT! She was not selfish with the tequila and I sure appreciated that!   I will DEFINITELY try again."}
{"text":"I know Barrio is all the Food Network rage, so I can only speak on the airport location. In a nutshell, the breakfast food was disappointing. The menu itself is condensed which I understand, but this leaves little to no room for variation and flavor. I ordered the Chilaquiles Verde and when it arrived to the table: a few soggy, stale chips, with a few pieces of pork, and two bland eggs. Seriously, there was no flavor and barely any pork. The two stars accounts for the server who was nice and prompt, the coffee (pressed), and the decor. We killed some time but really should have grabbed a bagel and coffee, and saved the dollars."}
{"text":"Average but expensive airport food. Had the pork burrito, it was salty and uninspiring."}
{"text":"This place had the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Overpriced, greasy, and tasteless. Avoid the horchata."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on my back to South TX. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The chorizo con huevos was outstanding! Excellent Mexican food, particularly in an airport! Definitely recommend this place to weary travelers tired of overpriced, bland airport food. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Barrio cafe in Phoenix airport... What scatter brain corporate executive in charge of this place green lighted and ok'd the use of jalapeno peppers in ALL repeat ALL the hash browns??? So your kids will be screaming/crying for mercy with one bite. And there's not even a warning... Just some idiotic \"our famous barrio browns\" in the menu description. Wake up and fire some CEO's please and fix your menu. Also the food was horrible. $30 at the airport for two breakfasts that weren't even as good as Mc Donalds or Burger king breakfast. You people should be ashamed. I didn't know that it was even possible to screw eggs, bacon and hash browns up this bad. My advice would be to avoid this place at all costs. A microwave breakfast burrito that has been frozen since Abraham Lincoln was born would be better. Run for your life."}
{"text":"Americanized Mexican.   No beans, no rice, and apparently no fresh guacamole. The menu claims that the guacamole is prepared \"table side\". Instead I received what I would classify as a cereal-bowl-sized serving. This cereal bowl came out appearing to be thrown together at some point during the day (hopefully) and then tossed into the fridge until some ill informed customer orders this $12.50 \"fresh\" not fresh dish.  How can an airport in such a Mexican affluent area serve \"Mexican\" dishes over...fries...?"}
{"text":"Food was ok, waiter forgot the beer I ordered.   Also, he picked up 5-6 cups from different tables at once and asked who wanted refills. Not too weird, but cup came back to me with a chewed straw in it. Not mine. Who knows if the cup was."}
{"text":"The positive: it was fast. The negative: God awful chicken tacos. Came soaking in juice at the bottom the plate. The tortillas completely ripped apart when you picked them up and all I could taste was watery goat cheese. Salad was crammed in a tiny bowl so it just fell out all over when you tried to get a bite. Find another option for eating. Not worth it. I would say hands down, worst tacos I've ever had."}
{"text":"Was hungry on the way out of PHX so stopped here.  Margarita - yum.  Food - came out cold.  Came back again was luke warm.  The guy next to me said hi steak was not that warm either.  Would move this review to four stars if they heated their plates!  Service: pretty good actually.  At least for me.  Just get drinks and colder items like guac or salad."}
{"text":"Usually airport restaurants don't stand out, but Barrio Cafe in the D gate area definitely does. When I have a layover in Phoenix I go out of my way to eat there. Food is excellent and service always fast, friendly and efficient. I always make a point to order their French Press coffee. It is the best coffee I've ever had. Barrio is worth the long walk from the C gates."}
{"text":"Good drinks-not horribly overpriced.  GREAT drink specials - $11 for a 20oz GOOD beer and a shot of anything!  Can't beat that!!!  Friendly bartenders and decent food.    You know, what can you REALLY expect from an airport restaurant.  You don't go for the food.  If you're really hungry enough to eat at the airport, then don't expect 4 star restaurant quality.... and don't judge the airport restaurants as such.   This really is the only bar/restaurant option in the Southwest terminal.  I found a security guard and asked about some of the other restaurants in the airport and was told that unless you want to make the 20-30 minute hike around security to get around to some of the other gates, you should just stay put.  I'm actually glad he suggested this- even though I had a 3 hour layover.  The menu LOOKS impressive... but again, remember where you are.  I did happen to be starving and needed a little something to soak up the drinks I would be consuming during my loooong layover.  I ordered the poblano burritto.  For an airport burrito it wasn't bad- but it was slightly lacking in flavor.  I asked for something to add some spice and they provided me with three different kinds of salsa to try, which did make it a little better.    What most impressed me was the service.  The bartenders and servers were all upbeat and smiley- very friendly and definitely created a welcoming atmosphere.  The drinks were not HORRIBLY over- priced and now if you order a beer, you can add a shot of ANYTHING for $4!  I got a shot of Don Julio (which might normally be at least $10+) so ended up paying $11 for a 20oz Modelo Especial and excellent tequila.    And other reviewers were right.... this is definitely a great place for eye candy!  All the hotties seem to flock here..."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Takes FOREVER. avoid if you don't have time to linger."}
{"text":"I hate Yelp.  I detest that people would rather sit through a bad restaurant experience than be proactive on the spot, get a manager and make things instantly better. Instead, they fester in their car ride home and then critique what could have been fixed.  Because of this I don't get too negative and slam places... normally.  That being said guys, this was terrible and you need to 1. know about it  2.  fix it.  There were three people at your bar on a slow Thursday morning.  There were two bartenders, someone doing inventory and digging through the coolers and some other random staff on the floor.  The service was absolutely and completely non-existent.  Zero sense of urgency - at an airport none the less.  The employees were seemingly staring off into space and having random conversations with each other -  completely ignoring customers, tickets, bussing dirty plates, etc...  I have been in the industry for over 20 years and the anxiety I felt because the place was running so poorly was overwhelming.  The three of us at the bar, all complete strangers, were looking at each other in disbelief.  I guarantee we are all still talking about how frustrated we were.  A keg blew when this poor guy finally got some attention and the tap exploded foam all over him, only to be told by the bartender that \"it happens all the time\".  He got his beer 7 minutes later - a restaurant eternity.  Come on guys - I know it's an airport but it's still your name and you have to get some attention down there."}
{"text":"I would only recommend this place for the drinks! I find it odd that a Mexican food place doesn't sell chips and salsa or beans! The main side for food is fries!!! It's really weird! I think they should rethink their menu!' For this reason I give them 2 stars!  I had a chicken spinach salad and it was decent!"}
{"text":"This place seems super cute when you walk in. Then boom the bad attitude behind the bar hits you. No smile, and you are greeted with a \"your going to have to take your purse off the bar....it is a health code violation\".What a joke. The purse on the bar,not a health code violation. The 1/4 inch of dust on your beers taps, now that is a health violation. Dropping in every beer you pour. Which I probably would not have been looking at if you had greeted me with a hello and a simple smile. Employ people who love what they do!"}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten my food(to go) yet, but they gave my order to someone else, then made it with the wrong side, and now I'm hoping I make my flight.  Folks standing to order while a gal stands playing with her phone in fruit of them.  Idiots."}
{"text":"I love Barrio Cafe in the Barrio on 16th St, but the airport location is leaving. I was seated for 7 minutes, completely ignored by the wait staff and I got up to leave. A manager in a dress shirt had told someone would be by but he didn't seem bothered when he saw me leaving later. Oh well. I get seated much better at the real Barrio (16th St and Thomas). One would think they would be faster at the airport. I wouldn't go to the airport location unless you have a couple hours until your flight.  I love Chef Silvana, but this location is a dud."}
{"text":"The food was good, I had pork tacos. Even my waitress Schilee was great! Why only 3 stars? The hostesses were THAT bad. Snobby to the max. One wouldn't put her iPhone down even while seating people! And when two ladies asked for a different table than where she tried to seat them? She handed them their menus and made them seat themselves and walked off annoyed with them. It was so bad I'm docking two stars."}
{"text":"Don't come for large portions. Food was good quality but a bit pricey. Service was rushed and inattentive."}
{"text":"The food is bland and the drinks are expensive, If this doesn't bother you it's an ok spot to hang out between flights with a few flat screens to entertain you."}
{"text":"I decided to try the Barrio Cafe at the airport on Thanksgiving morning before my flight and I received the absolute rudest service I have been a witness too.  The man who served me should not be in the customer service business.  That kind of service is bad for business and really is an embarrassment to the brand."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Extremely overpriced, even for airport food. Ordered chips and salsa for $9. Was basically a basket with like 30 chips in it. Margarita was served in a tiny glass, basically a small cocktail glass full of ice with a splash of mixer. Service was rude, almost laughed when we commented on the menu, basically said \"yea we can charge whatever we want\" I mentioned the small glass full of ice they called a margarita, basically told that's how it is. The host at the front was almost annoyed we even showed up, wouldn't even acknowledge us arriving. So we proceeded to walk to a table then suddenly she's interested and barks at where we think we are going......save yourself the time and just walk elsewhere. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Our expectations at any airport are not high - many travelers are hurried, lost, rude, etc. understandably it's a tough job. If you are feeling up to being ignored from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out, this is the place! The Barrio cafe in the Phoenix airport seems to have perfected \"the annoying customer\" role to a tee. Don't even try to be polite unless you have the overwhelming desire to pay a lot of money for what looked to be \"ok\" food and treated like a nuisance. Can't comment on the food as we walked out. I give them an A+ for perfecting horrible customer service, however they will not be getting my $$$."}
{"text":"$14 burrito with south of France ingredients. Uh, HELLO, were in a recession!"}
{"text":"Pros: Drinks are good. Cons: Breakfast was cold (twice), and expensive.  We were early for a flight and stopped in for breakfast and a marg.  Breakfast came out cold.  We asked for them to pop the meals in the microwave for a minute, and would have been happy with that.  Instead, they remade the meals, which again came out cold.  By this point, we didn't have much time before our flight, so we ate some of the food, then left.  The manager was nice and apologetic, but nothing was comp'd and our meal with 2 drinks each cost about $75, not including tip.  This would never happen at the 16th street location - Frankly, ownership should be paying more attention to their chains, particularly at an airport where opinions can be formed quickly by locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"For being at the airport I have to say their food is fantastic. I am a taco freek and their beer battered shrimp tacos are the bomb! I get them everytime I go to the tthis airport."}
{"text":"Incredible nachos. Fresh made cups, variety of cheeses and super fresh ingredients. Seriously so good and shocking for an airport. Go get em."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Overpriced food and drinks.  Overall lack of zest to everything and everyone working here"}
{"text":"Try the guacamole - it's an experience.  Service is authentico too.  Cold beer -  all its missing is a beach!"}
{"text":"Food was very delicious. Table side guacamole was awesome. We both got a taco dinner which was very yummy w a side salad. Filling and fairly  healthy, tasted extremely fresh. We got out in 30 min for a flight. Highly recommend and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I ate at the original barrio cafe on 16th which was very good and interesting (maybe a little overpriced) but definetly recommended.  The airport barrio cafe was like the owner lost control of the car and drove off the road that has taken them to success.  I ordered a burrito (don't remember which) but it was soggy, with what tasted like canned chicken and a ton of sour cream.  Nasty!!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning, to try something different. Definitely should have just kept walking. I know airport food is overpriced, but not like this and for the portions given. Ordered Chilaquiles with pork Verde sauce...with no pork. It had plenty of chips, eggs, a little cheese, little salsa, cubed potatoes, with little sauce. Spoke with the Manager and he stated that he gets this complaint a lot and that I should have said something when it came out. Only thing is, is that this dish comes out stacked , so how are we suppose to know if there is no meat before eating some to get to that point. Also, it was obvious there was still a lot left on the plate when we returned it. I noticed other complaints about meat portions as well. Wish I had of read reviews prior to coming here. Just know even if you complain you will still have to pay full price and leave hungry."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Awful food. The breakfast burrito was soggy and disgusting. There was none of the advertised salsa verde. They did remove the food from our bill, so I have to give the very nice waitress credit."}
{"text":"The Pollo Poblano burrito was fantastic!  Best chicken burrito I have had in a long time!  Service was great, our waitress was hustling all over the restaurant but she never forgot us or the tables around us.  The Guacamole was so good, who knew pomegranate was so great with avocado!"}
{"text":"Usually I don't do airport food.  WOW, great food, atmosphere and awesome staff!  Brittany and Monica are awesome! Highly recommend you swing by the D-Gates."}
{"text":"Can't even get a simple tequila shot correct and brought in a timely fashion. Overpriced & service isn't all that."}
{"text":"I almost didn't stop in here due to the middling rating. I'm glad I did!  Delicious Michelada and chicken poblano torta, good music, atmosphere, and awesome murals."}
{"text":"Barrio was a serious letdown. Given the limited options in D gates I have given this place no fewer than five tries. Significantly overpriced for poor quality food is a pretty good summary. I even got sick one time within 20 minutes of eating. I wish D gates had better options, but I am guessing Barrio will be replaced in 2014."}
{"text":"Spend your money elsewhere. I had a chicken burrito and thankfully nothing else. The  servers were slow and rude and the water seriously tasted like it came out of an old outdoor water hose."}
{"text":"I just paid $24 ($27 with tip) for a bowl of soup, a diet coke, and an order of chips and salsa! The service was good. The soup was a decent portion and tasted good. The chips that came with the salsa were so hard I couldn't chew them without fear of breaking a tooth. When I ordered the chips and salsa, the waitress told me they cost $9, and if they were actually edible I would say OK. However, this was a huge waste money. I even tried soaking the chips in the soup to soften them up, but that didn't really work. I left nearly the entire bowl of chips. I walked out of there feeling totally ripped off. Soup, a soft drink, and hard as hell chips for $24! I won't eat here again. I know its an airport, but that is ridiculous."}
{"text":"14 minutes before the server came to the table. Got water in 21 minutes. Food was good but served cold. Most likely server issue male server brown hair man bun wandered about aimlessly. Another patron at the table next to me ordered a beer, we were laughing about the service, she finally got a beer about 20 minutes after she sat down."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite breakfast spot in the swa gate area. I used to travel a lot, and would arrive early to grab breakfast. Barrio was always my go to spot. I think that will be changing. I ordered an omelette and it was quite small. The potatoes were luke warm, and the toast was hard as a rock! And the waitress didn't do a good job of filling my drink."}
{"text":"This was a great experience at an airport. The wife and I both had the pork tacos and they were great. The spicy ketchup as it's called was the bomb and made the tacos taste that much more better. Our server was on top of it and had our tea and soda glasses always full. If you are hungry and at this location in sky harbor airport, this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Love original Barrio Cafe and Barrio Queen in Scottsdale so thought airport Barrio was a blessing.  Had a bowl of posole and SMALL glass of wine for 26 (before tax and tip). Flight delayed so order the  \"large\" 8 oz wine. Get the ck-$22.74. For ONE average size/quality glass of wine.  OUTRAGEOUS. The staff shares that owners been spotted once in whole time since place is open. Way to rip off your loyal local customers."}
{"text":"So. You are trapped inside security and need a meal. I give this place three stars for trying. Their prices are high, even for airport food ($26 for enchiladas with sides?). I have dined here only twice, but would recommend sticking to the smaller and less expensive menu items. My enchiladas seemed to have had the cheese slide out if them, and the number of shrimp was shrimpy. I had tried the pork tacos before, and they were very good. The spicy mashed potatoes were also tasty. They do have outlets at their bench seating so you can charge your devices."}
{"text":"The only reason to go to this place is because you are held captive at the airport.  It is extremely over priced even for airport food.  The nachos are $17 and barely enough for one person to enjoy.  Taco Bell has better nachos than here.  The Arizona burrito has no flavor and served with salty seasoned fries.  The  margaritas are very overpriced, small and no flavor starting at $10."}
{"text":"Worst tasting (no flavor/taste) Blooding Mary ever!!!! No veggies included, only a lime and lemon, that looked like they were two weeks old!!"}
{"text":"Got stuck a little longer than expected and landed here for dinner. Near Southwest gates D 1 - 8. A bit busy (its 5:30 pm) but I didn't have to wait for a seat. Nice. Traveling solo and the long counter facing out with a place to charge my phone was just what I needed for my hour and a half. They told me it cost $2 to sit here and believed them but yea.... I missed the joke being so tired. Decent looking menu and I opted for the Posole Verde. Pretty quick service. Pork, hominy, & tomatillo topped with cabbage, radish, cilantro, onions, and lime. There's some serious chunks of pork in this soup! A little spicy and extremely salty but I mean, it's pork soup. Duh. My only gripe really was when the waitress placed had spilled soup from the bowl into the dish and I had to rescue a soup covered spoon before I could eat. I'm sure I could've gotten a new one had I asked but I just wiped it down. Other than that, $10 well spent at an airport."}
{"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the chilaquiles! I order my food to go because of the limited time before my connecting flight. When at the counter the cashier asked how I wanted my eggs...I was slightly confused because I thought they were always mixed in. Needless to say I just said scrambled. The taste was amazing! The cheese was phenomenal and taste was incredible! The chilaquiles were prepared perfectly, they reminded me of the ones i enjoyed while living in TJ. I would definitely go back.  Try it."}
{"text":"I am a pilot with an hour to kill before show time of my next flight. I opt to sit down and relax while I get some good Mexican food. That was nice. I order the $6 Jamaica. The waiter was very confusing when he called it the Jamaica flower water. I've never heard it called that way and it sounds more like a lightly flavor infused water like rose water or something ludicrous. Nope, the waiter just didn't know how Jamaica is made so it seamed normal to him to call it water and not more like sweetened iced tea of flore de Jamaica. Now that's out of the way I get the Arizona burrito.  After a few minutes I down the Jamaica and the food comes out. It looks great  and I ask for a refill on the Jamaica.  There are no refills. The glass was a 12oz glass with 8oz of ice. That is $1.50 an ounce for Jamaica. Are these managers completely nuts? It was good but outside of Manhattan I've never ordered something so expensive.  The burrito was very flavorful but again small for $13 then piled high with frozen steak fries.  So $20.58 for a burrito and Jamaica later I'm out of here never to go back. There are many other great dining options here in sky harbor. No need to stop here unless you are not hungry and you don't care what things cost. Note to the managers. An appropriate price for these would be $1.75 for the Jamaica (or have free refills) and $9 for the burrito. Out the door with tip $12.50. I was so overcharged by your prices that I did not include a tip. I hope you pay your waiters well"}
{"text":"I've been flying since the days that airport restaurants were generally considered a joke and you had pay for practically everything inside the terminal with cash.   Today, things have changed and it is more uncommon to get a bad meal in an airport than not.   Barrio Cafe in the B terminal at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport is certainly better than your average airport fare (pun intended).   We had the guacamole and chips, as well as Burrito Pollo Poblano (chicken), and it was great. Service was prompt and attentive as well."}
{"text":"Of course my flight was delayed so I decided to sit down and have a meal at Barrio. First of all the service I received from both the manager and my server was some of the best I have had. After being seated, the manger stopped by to see if I had any questions about the menu, which I did, and he proceeded to go back to the kitchen and show me the type of chip they use for their nachos. While my daughter and I were waiting for our food, he brought her out a thinly sliced apple without me asking for anything. The nachos were different than I have ever had, and were awesome! Their pork is delicious and the sauce, yes sauce, for the nachos was super good. I wish they had a Barrio in Seattle because I will be craving these nachos!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and DO NOT eat here! Terribly overpriced, my order was wrong, food was lukewarm, and had to ask for a glass of water 3 times - and finally received it in a dirty glass. Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say something good, but the food was lousy, overpriced and the service wasn't much better"}
{"text":"I've been this to restaurant several times while waiting for my flight. I ordered the poblano sandwich and it was good. My server Marina was so helpful and friendly that I hope she's working next time I'm at the airport.."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite to eat before my flight. Ordered the \"Arizona Burrito\" and some fries. Fries came out cold and there was some type of hard plastic in my 1st bite. Promptly informed waitress and instead of apologizing or explaining she grabbed the plastic, disappeared and showed up again with a \"new\" burrito. I told her I wasn't interested and she stated that these things happen and basically what's the big deal???!!! Are you kidding me???!!!! Never coming again!!"}
{"text":"I really appreciate having the option of sampling some local restaurants in an airport, rather than just the standard chain places.  Barrio Cafe is a restaurant in Phoenix, and this is their representation inside the airport.    I chose this spot because the menu items were interesting, slightly more exotic than the standard cheese quesadilla or fish tacos.  My guac was fine.  I was not a fan of the really thick chips, but I did think the dried cranberries were a nice twist.  My pork tacos were excellent.  The side salad was small and pretty much just lettuce, but fresh.  The bar style seating facing out towards the gates was great for people watching, and there are outlets at about every other seat.  The service was fast and friendly.  I like that they have those call buttons so you don't have to try to flag down your server to get your bill, but the device design could use some work."}
{"text":"Lol @ the previous reviewer's comment, \"Walk to Terminal C instead\". Bahaha!  That's pretty funny although I can't state that I had the same experience. Departed a Corporate event this past Friday and in between flights we all developed the \"munchies\". We decided to split an order of nachos which was surprisingly enough for 4.  Perhaps I've grown a bit too used to the \"fake\" Mexican food in California however this place didn't come up short. I'll digress again and state that perhaps my expectations weren't all that heightened in lieu of this being \"airport food\".  I was quite taken aback. Haha... Maybe I'll fly back in for another meal.   Maybe....  Did I mention that my colleagues all became so inebriated on the booze served here that we all missed our flights??? Nothing better than being buzzed in an airport and having to wait standby for the next flight.  -___-"}
{"text":"I'm giving Barrio Cafe 5 stars for our AMAZING and knowledgeable server- Alexzander! She helped us find delicious drinks, gluten free options, made us great table-side guacamole and modified our orders to make them perfect! She was the best and I am so thankful for her great service and kind personality!"}
{"text":"Wow, I have a lay over flight and decided to have lunch. What a pleasant surprise. I'm enjoying the torta barrio, fantastic spice. A green chile that actually has flavor and spice, most delicious. My taste buds are jumping for joy. Ice cold Pacifico and spicy Mexican food, people watching....yeah for me!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here to charge my phone and have a glass of wine before my flight. Maria, my server, was very kind. I ordered a 6 oz of Malbec, which was nice.  No fault of Maria's, but my wine glass was filthy. It looked like it had been run through the sani-wash and left to air dry. Lots of water spots and little hygienic misses.  I wouldn't come back for anything other than a drink. Sorry."}
{"text":"Ridiculously disappointed. Came to my favorite dining spot at the airport only to find that they don't serve breakfast burritos.  I am really!!!! You are a Mexican food restaurant!!!!!"}
{"text":"After being asked by a fellow yelper to elaborate, here it goes.   We approached the hostess and asked for a table for 3 plus a high chair. When she jokingly said \"no\" I laughed and proceeded to ask for a menu to which she again replied \"no\"! I guess this was her attempt at humor, however after the first time, it seemed to have lost something. By the way, she never really indicated that she was joking.  So, $50, 1 ceasar salad, 1 spinach chicken whatever salad,  a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples, and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight.   Oh, in between sitting down and paying the check, the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold, soggy burrito and rubberized tenders. The waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled.   While I understand we ate at an airport, this is unacceptable. Next time I'll be sure to read up on more yelp reviews before I waste a meal here.   They'll be hearing from me soon."}
{"text":"Loved the nachos, a definite must to get if you want to share. Not the ordinary nachos, much much better!  We had the grilled chicken nachos... awesome!  Victor is was a great waiter, very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu (he suggested the nachos), you'll be lucky to get him when stop in there before your flight."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. We waited nearly ten minutes before I had to ask for a manager because  no one came to our table.  They were busy, but someone should have at least acknowledge us.  I will likely not come back."}
{"text":"Reena-an was so friendly she even plugged in my cell phone for me crawling on the floor to plug it in.  The food was very good to.  It made my 2 hour delay much easier"}
{"text":"The best airport food I've had in years, if ever.   I knew I was in for something special when the waiter brought the bread and sauce, a sublime combination of tapenade, caponata and salsa.   Then came the menu. Decisions, decisions. Should I play it safe and order a burrito or try something different and new? I chose the latter and went with the cochinita pibil, a slow-cooked (12 hours) pork dish served with mashed potatoes, a sort of pico de gallo, marinated cucumbers, tortillas and a little au jus on the side. Fan-freakin'-tastic.   Not sure why the other Yelpers on here gave this place such short shrift. If Barrio's other locations really are that much better than here, then this is the best Mexican \"chain\" on earth.   Worth getting to the airport early for!"}
{"text":"Good airport food...actually, just good food.  Had pollo poblano tacos with chorizo. Very good.  A bit pricey for a quick meal before a flight but beats the other options."}
{"text":"The airport Barrio Cafe has the best nachos I have ever had in my life... Trust me I have had a lot of nachos.  These are foodie nachos not yellow cheese game day nachos.  Last time I was at Barrio Queen they did not have them at that location.  Nachos plus a fabulous margarita here are the start to a great trip either for business or pleasure!"}
{"text":"Hopefully their food is better than their attitude. Don't worry your faces won't break if you smile. The real Barrio Cafe 16th and Thomas might want to give a pep talk to the hostess. Ana was sweet"}
{"text":"This was my most disappointing airport food experience ever.  Thinking, \"hey, we went to barrio cafe and it was a great meal, we can have a good meal at the airport.  great!\" I went in with expectations.  And those expectations were so not met.  First off, no frozen margaritas.  They're on the menu, but they were out?  How does one run out of traditional frozen margarita?  Pretty sure you take all the usual ingredients with ice and stick it in a blender.  So 2 members of our party left.  Then we get food.  Disaster.  I order the cochinita pibil (which I had the last time I was at Barrio Cafe).  Definitely not as good.  Didn't finish it.  Hardly ate it. Husband was served overcooked, dry, microwaved chicken.  We had margaritas on the rocks.  They tasted like salt.  Just salt.  They comped the chicken (after my husband complained), but we're not going back.  There are better restaurants for us to spend our money at."}
{"text":"Awesome upscale Mexican food for airport! Got the az burrito. Yummy green chili pork! In D terminal right by boarding"}
{"text":"Airport in Arizona refuses to change channel to Arizona basketball game because manager won't let them.  Instead we watch nothing at all...."}
{"text":"The food was good but they needed more meat in it. the bloody marys are excellent, have a double. Our server Cardi, short for Bacardi, was great! She did an excellent job.  Only thing I would recommend is to have the hostess wipe the tables w a dry napkin prior to sitting folks. Really annoying to sit down on a WET table top!"}
{"text":"Three stars is probably spot-on for an aggregate score of this place.  They are in the airport but they are an extension of one of the popular local Mexican places.   That said,  I probably would have been far happier had time allowed me to go to one of their other locations.  I could sense a much higher level of cuisine when reading their menu than what arrived at my table.   I secured a table after a wait of less than 2 minutes.  Securing a server took quite a bit longer. There was a waitress who showed up after I had been sitting there for about 5 minutes but she walked right past me and proceeded to lean against a fixture behind me.  I turned around and asked her if she was my server.   She wasn't.  She didn't approach my table, didn't ask if she could be of assistance and didn't offer to find my server.  She just leaned.  I asked her to assist me with finding my server and she offered me a seat in her section instead.  I was settled,  my bags were settled... I just wanted to be introduced to my server.  With much reluctance, she finally pointed her out.  Thanks.   When my server was table-side,  I told her I can't eat jalapeños.  No problem - we can prepare almost anything you want without them.  I selected an enchiladas dish and asked if it could be prepared without jalapeños - she said the dish doesn't have jalapeños.  It arrived with something on  the side that looked a whole lot like it contained jalapeños.  Her answer: it's on the side,  you should be fine.  Should, huh?   I had the enchiladas with shrimp.  There were six small cheese enchiladas with a beautiful sauce and four decent size shrimp perched on top.  The dish was beautiful.  Sadly,  it arrived barely luke warm and the waitress vanished.     I could tell that this would have been a killer dish in one of their real restaurants  but it was flat here.  The sauce was creamy, cheesy and just slightly salty with that great mouth-filling taste that you get when you bring goat cheese to the party.  I wished I had a few tortilla chips to scrape up the remainder after I finished the enchiladas but chips don't come with the meal at this location.  The shrimp were cooked just about perfectly but lacked a scampi flavor as the menu had promised.  The tortillas were slightly hard around the edges... not sure if they were stale but it seemed likely.  I really, really wish that I had the opportunity to try their food in one of their real restaurants.  I don't know that I will be back in Phoenix anytime soon but getting to one of their real locations will be my first dining priority and I will do so with an open mind.  Unfortunately, and the other Yelp reviews bear this out, the only thing this location is doing is besmirching their good name among travelers."}
{"text":"Good food. Approach a little rough when walking in with a Starbucks. Come on folks this is an airport. We had a big group. They finally warmed up. At the end ok. But need to to work on that first greeting"}
{"text":"Well.....I've been excited to fly out of the D gates because of Barrio. Unfortunately, the last 5 times I've been here, I can't get a Bloody Maria because they're out if tomato juice or the 'mix' Very disappointing, but the chilaquilles are always awesome..  Today I got my cocktail, but the service is very slow. I understand it's 3 days before NYE, but the terminal is almost empty and so is the restaurant.  Took 10mins to get a waitress so I could order, then I waited 10 to get the only thing I ordered...my cocktail.  Ehhh...."}
{"text":"I have visited Barrio Cafe yet again as I had time while flying from D gates at terminal 4. The service was much better this visit. Although Ramiro didn't tell me his name, it's on my receipt. He was knowledgeable regarding gluten limitations and made safe suggestions. The food came out quickly. It was okay, the marinated pork was good. Unfortunately the tortillas were soaking in the juice which made for a nasty soggy mess. Ramiro brought a fresh side of tortillas at no additional charge. That was the saving grace."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the worst meals I've ever had at an airport. Overpriced menu, stale chips, nearly inedible corn tortillas. The only saving grace of the Barrio Cafe is that it serves alcohol so you can forget how bad your meal tasted."}
{"text":"You can tell the bartenders have no training. Really awful and you're throwing your money away because the drinks aren't cheap either. Just watching them you can see they don't know how to pour, their counts are way off, they don't know the recipes, and can't shake a cockltail correctly. I watched them pour more Grand Marnier than tequila into the tin and then squirt about 3 times more cheap sweet and sour juice into the tin. Her shake was pethetic. She gave it one up and then one more. She looked scared like she was holding a soda that may have been shaken around. Being a Mexican restaurant and the margarita being the most popular cocktail in the world you'd think they would have it down, especially for $13 each! Food is very average! For the money they charge and the quality of service you're better off going to a different terminal and eating anywhere else I promise you. If the food was average and the service was at all passable I would give this a 3 star but they really go out of their way for piss poor all around. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is a great airport eatery and bar. I came here once before and had an awesome Bloody Mary. This morning my husband and I had breakfast burrito and breakfast sandwich.  Both were substantial (particularly the burrito which was bursting with chile verde) and delicious! Servers were very nice too."}
{"text":"You've got to expect prices at any sit down restaurant in any airport to be higher than if you were in a similar restaurant off-airport.  So I didn't flinch at the $14 price for a chicken burrito, because I knew I'd be paying over $5 for a processed burger at a fast food place (bleh!).  Instead, my burrito was chunk full of chicken, avocado and spices and was served with spicy fries.  Tasted quite good!  I sat in the lounge area on a sofa with a small table and was able to kick off my shoes and work from my iPad as I enjoyed my meal.  My server, Shauna was excellent and so friendly.  Would call me by name every time she passed by to make sure I was taken care of.  A great place to relax and enjoy a meal or drink away from the fast food crowds before taking flight!"}
{"text":"Five star service from Rabecca thanks !  Breakfast burrito with two eggs and salsa. Top this off with a great Pinot noir wow that's a meal.  This airport really knows how to pamper it's guests.  Service in this restaurant is fast and friendly. Management is nice as well. This is a quality spot."}
{"text":"Pricey and the food taste old. Had the fish tacos at 11am they were fries in oil that should have been replaced fries were also so sad the place is cute service ok but the food can use both flavor and freshening up. I would not visit again."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had dinner here during unexpected flight delay and was seated immediately. Started with house margaritas on the rocks - arrive in small glass but was decent. Hubby got the Arizona burrito and I the shrimp tacos both with side salads. Fresh avocado slices topped the tacos even though not mentioned on menu - which made them perfect. Only complaint was each taco only came with 1 shrimp and chips/salsa were not included on table with our meal as we would see at other similar restaurants (maybe not custom @ airport setting?). Hubby described pork as a stewed pork with good flavor in large flour tortilla. Service was super quick, friendly and food surprisingly yummy. Would eat here again."}
{"text":"Currently waiting in line, so I can't rate the food. And I don't really care about the price (it's an airport, that's expected). But a 25-minute wait (and still counting...) for a take-out order of tacos and a torta is completely unacceptable, especially in a virtually empty airport with the tables in the restaurant area only half full.  They're somewhat new. Hopefully the next time we're here, these serious problems will be resolved. And if it's not, hopefully they'll be replaced by the next time after that. They need to fail if they can't figure this out.  *Update*: After a 30-minute wait, I decided to run to the plane (which was otherwise boarded and ready to go). After I asked for my money back, the employee at the register did not respond to me at all, then went to the kitchen window gave me one of the two to-go boxes and said it would only be a little while longer. I couldn't wait, so I figured we'd just split the one meal. Of course, it wasn't even our order. So in addition to my awful experience, that means someone else who was waiting also did not get their order (because I got it). And the torta we did get was not very good.   Ultimately, I share some blame in this. I read these other one-star Yelp reviews and still went there anyway. That was a huge mistake. This place is a disaster."}
{"text":"Servicing fries with burritos. Wtf No salsa with it.  Chose of salad or fries, really and this is supposed to be Mexican food  Street tacos were ok, salad dressing would make salad swim Server ( Tami) was good though very pleasant"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food in the Phoenix airport.  Hubby ordered a green chile burrito.  It had great flavor and full of pork.  The fries that came with it were a little soggy.  I had the steak tacos.  Very good!  The salad that came with it was fresh and the tacos themselves had great flavor.  I didn't care too much for the salsa, but I usually don't but salsa on my steak tacos anyway, so no loss there.  I ordered a classic margarita.  I wasn't a fan, but hubby liked it.  I REALLY liked the chips and quac.  I couldn't stop eating them, in fact I took my remaining chips to go to eat them as a snack later.  We don't get to Phoenix very often, but if we do, we would definitely come back.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Five stars for fresh, authentic Mexican street food, in a damn airport for crying out loud! My husband's pork burrito was tender, fresh and bursting with flavor. I ordered a shrimp quesadilla, and out came four small flat tortillas each topped with a single juicy jumbo shrimp, then covered in melted cheeses and super fresh pico de gallo. Everything was on point - the texture and home-made quality of the tortillas and chips; the slow roasted and marinated pork; the freshness of all ingredients, run out of the kitchen as soon as they were prepared. This place is better than any of the 5 mexican places in my small SoCal town. And it's in an airport. In Arizona. HUH? A bit pricey for what it is, and the wine by the glass is $10 a pop, but again, you're in an airport. If you want to eat well, it's going to cost you."}
{"text":"Bartender stressed the authenticity of how traditional the food is here but yet they will NOT serve a customer chips and salsa. Claims there wasn't a button for it (what ever that means) and it wasn't worth losing his job for it. If you order the $10.95 tableside guacamole you can have chips. They do HAVE chips and they DO have salsa but it's not available to customers. They offer $25 meals but no chips and salsa. What a sham."}
{"text":"This restaurant replaced the Wendy's that was once here, and is currently the only option for food in the D-terminal. I ordered take out once, service was terrible, and I'm never coming back.  I give it a try, so I order the Torta del Barrio to go, with fries. It's a vegetarian option for $13, including cheese stuffed peppers among other vegetables. One gentleman was in front of me, so I wait after my order.  Three people order after me within 15 minutes, each ordering items on the menu of similar preparation (one even got the same dish). They were ALL SERVED BEFORE ME! I ended up waiting for 35 minutes for a meal that wasn't even that good. The fries were soggy and bland, and the bread for the torta tasted stale. No way that cost $13, I could've made that for under $5.  The restaurant didn't look that much better. The place was packed, and they pumped out a couple dishes every 10 minutes. The majority of tables were not served the entire time I was there, and they definitely ordered before I arrived.  When you're trying to fly out, you want a quick bite to eat. The 35 minutes wait was inexcusable, especially since all those customers were served until I was dead last. The most I got out of the cashier was \"Sorry, I tried.\" If you're going to serve food at the airport, that kind of service won't cut it.  I've never said this before, but I'd have preferred fast food at the time."}
{"text":"Literally had to wait 17 minutes to have a draft sam Adams poured.by the time it got to me I had to chug it so I wouldn't miss my flight. Server apologized after the fact saying they had to change the keg. I would have like to have had the option at first to switch my choice so that I could have enjoyed my beverage."}
{"text":"If you have time, this the place to eat & drink in the airport.  Great margaritas, the cochinita (pork) was pretty tasty, the pork fat sauce was awesome.  I saw others eating shrimp and stuffed jalapeños also look great!"}
{"text":"Ok first things first...airport restaurant...it's all relative isn't it?  For an airport Mexican restaurant this is pretty good albeit expensive. I think the ratings are low because everyone feels so overcharged they leave feeling ripped off despite some decent to good food."}
{"text":"Probably better go sit down and wait for your flight. Although I cannot comment on the food, the \"Cadilac Margarita\" has to be one of the worst I've ever had! I'm not even sure how it's possible to screw up good tequila this bad. More sour/bitter than anything I've ever put in my mouth. I'll be puckered for weeks........ See the pictures: Security to the rescue, this is ridiculous. These guys have offered to pay for what they had but the manager is arguing over a few bucks and called security. Stay away, this place is a catastrophe!"}
{"text":"Chiliquilies breakfast came with strips of tortilla but tasted like chips. No flavor. And barley warm.  Hardly any meat at all. Potatoes tasted like they came out of a cheap TV dinner.  Overpriced.  Coffee was ok. Came hot."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here again because last time I was waiting for a flight the food and service was awesome.   Not this time.   First off, the hostess said pick a seat and stops me as I find a table and shoves the menus In my hand. I sat down for 15 minutes and no one came to serve us. The restaurant wasn't busy at all otherwise I would've understood a little bit. There was a lot of servers walking around and chatting. Two were arguing about who swept the restaurant last... um you're not going to have any floors to sweep if no customers come because the lack of service. A table gets sat after us and they got greeted within minutes.   We got up and left. No one said anything. We clearly were ready to spend money on food and alcohol but nothing.   This will be the last time I come to this place. I made my way over to Zinc and was greeted and served within a minute. Glad I found a place who will take my money."}
{"text":"Worst. I just spent $15 on shrimp tacos. You know, three shrimp tacos... that only had one shrimp on each taco. So, basically, I spent $15 for 3 pint sized, tiny, deep fried shrimp and the smallest excuse for a side salad I've ever seen. I've heard so many good things about Barrio and I am so disappointed. What a waste of money. No thanks. I want my money back so I can actually eat since I'm still hungry after that joke. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Early for my flight, thought I would grab a beer and get something to eat ...  Now I am going to have to run to catch my flight!  So SLOW.  And they do not have blue moon on draft!  Won't stop here EVER again.  Wait staff is Terrible - no tip from me."}
{"text":"OMG... Just ordered the shrimp tacos and there were three tacos with one piece of shrimp PER TACO!!!  DO NOT GO HERE.  There are many great places to eat in the Sky Harbor Airport.  DO NOT EAT HERE.  Prices are even expensive for airport food.  STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Used the To go menu; chose a really fresh tasty salad. Quick and delicious. So much better than a greasy burger at the airport."}
{"text":"Best airport food ever.  Eclectic Mexican in a nice environment--given it's an airport.  Highly recommmended!"}
{"text":"If you are in Phoenix for a layover on Southwest this is the spot. For airport dining this place is well above on food quality and quick attentive service. It's great for people watching and although much of the food is stylized versions of Mexican food, including a lot of quick prep, reheat and serve kind of food, it's actually pretty tasty. I've had the shrimp tacos and they are pretty tasty, a bit over battered but good just the same. The fish taco plate is actually pretty decent size portion (4 tacos) for the money. Considering you are trapped for food choices the prices aren't too out of whack. The only major downside, and it is out of their control, is the volume of a/c being pumped into the terminal creates cold/windy spots in the dining room."}
{"text":"Beyond exceptional for airport food. We ordered two salads and they were fresh and the chicken was great. I would also like to thank our server, Marina for making sure I got my purse back to me that I left at the table. We were about to leave for Portland and I heard my name come on over the intercom. She didn't have to react as quickly as she did, but she did. I appreciate it. We also had quite a bit of cash we were carrying. Thank goodness for Marina! Give that girl a raise:-) We need more honest people like that in the world."}
{"text":"It's so very very rare, but this airport bar/restaurant actually has decent food and good service.  The menu is limited of course but I have never ordered anything I didn't like.   It is pricey compared to most of the other food options in the terminal. However! Did you know that all the restaurants in most US airports are all owned by the same company, it allows it to fix the market and keep all the prices high once you pass through TSA.  An absolute crime in my opinion.  This place also has a nice grab and go menu if you're in a rush.  Safe travels!!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning on Monday 2/8/16-ate the chorizo for breakfast at the airport Barrio in D section Got on flight from PHX to Ft Lauderdale. Within an hour an half had severe stomach pain and diarrhea. Arrived 4 hours later-got rental car and was gut wrenching vomiting out the car window. Food couldn't go thru intestines Recovered by Weds but food poisoning is terrible --a double wammy   I had loved Barrio for close to 20 years at all locations but will now stay away"}
{"text":"I wouldn't come to this restaurant unless you simply have no choice. The wait to get in was expected on a busy travel day. However what was unexpected was the lack of friendly service. I could have dealt with that. But once our drinks finally arrived there was a bug in the ice. After asking for a new cup we where informed that it's Knatt season????? Who cares just bring me a different cup. If anyone is interested they do offer just plain chips and Sala but heads up ITS $9.00 and there are no refills on the chips or the salsa the bowl is tiny not enough for one person to snack on. Only bright spot here was the Guacamole was freshly made. Which it better be for $13.00."}
{"text":"I am going to try and have all of my connections through sky harbor so I can enjoy Barrio cafe. The French toast is to die for!"}
{"text":"Eating at barrio is part of my southwest airlines airport ritual. I love their downtown location the most. I also like barrio queen in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Smooth usher into the restaurant. Had a burrito minus the goat cheese it came with. Was still an oily mess. Bland. Tortilla rubbery. I could say that was the worst burrito I've had if only someone convinced me it was a burrito. Other than the claim on the menu I have no other proof. Service by loud, tough Asian lady and snot-nosed kid was horrendous. The latter slammed the food down and left without giving one of us silverware. Had to walk down one of the waiters. We asked loud Asian lady for salsa. And waited. Had to walk her down as well.  Bad service at an airport restaurant is okay. But IF you want Mexican food PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast bite and a drink.  The bartender was friendly but a little brash.  No worries, I didn't plan on staying there too long anyway."}
{"text":"Stopped here with time to kill before my flight. Wasn't really that hungry but my sister and I decided to split the nachos. We got half beef and half chicken.   The food arrived in a surprisingly quick fashion and once I took my first bite I was in heaven.   My only issue was we asked the waiter for no mushrooms and it came with mushrooms. When we mentioned it he made a comment only four chips or so had the mushrooms. Are you serious? I would leave only 4 stars because of him as he was not friendly and was extremely slow on drink service. Waters and diet cokes...but the food redeemed him.  Back to the nachos. The chips were thick and delicious. The odd combination of spinach and bleu cheese added made an incredible addition to the nachos. Underneath the chips was a hidden liquidy sweet cheese we couldn't figure out what it was but didn't care it was SO good.   As mentioned before, I wasn't that hungry to begin with but once my sister stopped eating, I finished the whole plate. I would love to try and recreate these nachos but that seems near impossible."}
{"text":"We had just an hour-ish for a layover, so we stopped here for a quick dinner. Definitely very happy with our decision! Our waitress was pretty awesome. She was older and when she approached our table, she mentioned that they have $4 tequila shots. She didn't really offer the shots, as much as she told us about the shots in a way that we felt like it was a demand. Being challenged, and essentially called a wimp, we ordered the shots. My husband and I NEVER order shots when it is just us.. but hey, way to take our vacation to the next level, lady! We also ordered a couple beers (heck yes to Golden Road brews!) and the Barrio Nachos. These nachos were really really good. Beef with sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onions, jalapenos, spinach, cream, chorizo and bleu cheese and \"fresh Mexican farm cheese\". They also came slightly \"deconstructed\" so it wasn't just a messy mash of flavors. The rest of the menu looked pretty interesting as well.. not your typical Mexican food and certainly not your typical airport food. The nachos were $15, but large and enough for 2 to have as a meal. Would definitely stop here again!"}
{"text":"Today I decided that I'm going to eat at a place I've never been. I'm at the D terminal so checked this place out. Was greeted and seated right away. I just ordered water for my drink and that came pretty fast too.   Ordered their \"famous\" pork tacos with seasoned fries. The food came in literally minutes so that's great. Looked good and it smelled good. The fries came with spicy ketchup which was good but the fries were not crunchy on the outside. Seems like they have been waiting for me in the kitchen under the hot light. Seasoned? Deff not! I had to add salt. The \"famous\" pork? Not sure how bec there's no flavor on it. I had to add salt and I don't normally add salt to my food. It's just that there's no seasoning. I couldn't taste the flavors described on their menu. The corn tortillas tasted like they just took them out of the package. They didn't taste like they were even heated. The salsa was bland and by the way for a Mexican restaurant, they don't have rice and beans.   For $15, deff not coming back. The service is good and fast, hence the two stars but I'm not spending $15 on tacos that don't have flavor."}
{"text":"Best chicken enchiladas I have ever have.  Service ranges from outstanding to horrible depending on your server. If the service was consistent I'd give the enchiladas 5 stars."}
{"text":"Carne Asada was terrible small portion lots of fries. No flavor. I have eaten here twice both meals terrible."}
{"text":"Pros:  They have TVs. Cons:  All they're good for is the TVs. Seriously, if a kool-aid stand set up next to them and had TVs, I'd prefer to go there (especially if they sold vodka).  I ordered the fish tacos.  I think (and I'm not exaggerating) there was 1 oz. of fish in THREE tacos.  One was just batter.  And waaaaay over seasoned...think seasoned salt and Old Bay together.  Service?  Praytell, what's that?  I had to wave down my server after she was texting and later chatting with other servers.  Bottom line:  If you have time go to C gate (short walk) and you'll find TVs and better service."}
{"text":"It beats the average Airport food option but Sky Harbor is not average, not any more. There are so many great local food options here and I wouldn't say that Barrio is the best of them by far. They had some beer of draft so that was cool, just mexican beer though which isn't very exciting.   I ordered the Pork something Burrito which said it was Enchilada Style, with a side of Barrio Fries (only because my husband wanted fries). It's kind of weird to serve Seasoned Fries with a Burrito but whatever. The Burrito was just Pork, nothing else, and it hadn't even been filled all the way so there were gaps where filling should be and it was very thin for a Burrito. The Pork was fine, didn't see or taste the Green Chilies mentioned in the description and the Enchilada Style consisted of a teaspoon of grated Cheese pathetically sprinkled on top. The Tortilla was so soggy and not in a saucy Enchilada sort of way, in a watery wet nasty kind of way.   I ordered it to go so I couldn't really say anything but next time I'm going somewhere else. There are tons of other really great options in this airport!"}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos here are much better then the other place. I really liked the salsa they give you and the price was a little better."}
{"text":"I was hungry as I didn't eat breakfast before boarding my plane and Phoenix is where my connecting flight is. I ordered from the take out line. I tried ordering from the menu on the wall, but was told they still serving only breakfast and the cashier lady pointed me to the breakfast menu. So many options to choose from or the lack thereof... I ordered the Arizona Burrito which came with eggs. The burrito had cheese meat and potatoes on it. The meat saved the burrito from being too land. If I'm going to pay $13 for a burrito, it should've been a bit more tastier than this. I can get a much bigger burrito at a taqueria anywhere in San Francisco for about half that price."}
{"text":"Best airport food I've ever had hands down... uhhh hello!?! You're in an airport and buying alcohol did you expect it being cheap?!?! For an airport place it has great food, I had the chicken poblano burrito wife had pork tacos... they we're both outstanding! Yes a bit expensive but again you're in an airport! As far as it replacing Wendy's???? Are ya kidding me?!?! Hell yes! Go to sleep!!!"}
{"text":"I understand this is the PHX Airport location, but it was NOT impressive.  I had the Taco Pescado  (fish taco) and it was very good.   My wife had the Burrito, and it had pieces of PAPER inside! She ate about 1/3 of it before seeing the paper. Her 1st glass of water had a hair in it!!!  No reflection on the waiter because he handled the situation perfectly.  He knows how to treat a dissatisfied customer.  Thanks for your good service and understanding.     The kitchen staff obviously needs to clean up!"}
{"text":"This is an okay place near the D Gates in Terminal 4. I had a five hour layover at PHX so I thought I'd try it since a friend recommended it.   I had flan and a strawberry frozen margarita. Both were fairly average tasting and a bit expensive ($12 each).  The booth was ripped in multiple spots and I waited 30 minutes after sitting down before someone asked me if I had been helped. Luckily I wasn't in a rush.    A plus, if you sit along the booth there are outlets so you can charge your phone."}
{"text":"Nothing like the original, which I love.  I ordered the poblano chicken burrito.  I got a soggy burrito loaded with dry chicken, go figure. Anyway it's sounded great spicy chicken with grilled pablano, onions,  etc... I asked the waitress she went to the kitchen, only to come back and say it doesn't come with peppers or onions.  My response,  menu says it does. Well we're out of peppers, I can give you 10% off is that ok. No,  I didn't order a pile of chicken I'm a soggy burrito.  5 minutes late she comes back with a side of grilled onion,  peppers,  whatever else was supposed to be in the burrito.  It helps but I'm annoyed and the meat is cold at this point.  Whatever,  I have a flight to catch,  I just paid my tab (no discount), I'm done and never coming back."}
{"text":"Let's start this way. I could not decide between pork or beef tacos. I asked the server he said that the chef was known for her pork treatment. Chef ?? pork treatment?? These are words I would have never expected to hear at an airport restaurant. Way cool. And the food itself delicious again very unexpected at an airport. This is not the least expensive place here but well worth it. You are about to be crammed on to a SWA plane at least enjoy this one luxury."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast.  Didn't want to shuffle around in a line and wander through crowds to find somewhere to sit.  Other reviews say service was bad, ours was fine.  Food was good.  It's an airport restaurant which means expensive but overall had a fine experience."}
{"text":"Service is slow, and the Bloody Mary that I love to have before a flight was way disappointing."}
{"text":"What can you say other than it's an airport restaurant? Everything is overpriced & not too high on quality but the drinks are good & it gives you something to do while you wait for boarding. At least the server was decent."}
{"text":"The most disgusting and unsanitary worker I have ever seen! Blew her nose  multiple times behind the bar, literally dug her finger in her ears, coughed/hacked and used her hand as a snot rag. Took out the trash, reached inside the trash and never washed her hands. Here's the kicker... she reaches INSIDE the water pitcher pour spout with her nose-wiping, ear-drilling , trash picking hands... who does that?   Health department would have a field day. Yuck, left after telling the managers... who, interestingly enough , were there to watch the whole thing without stopping her."}
{"text":"Sure, it's a little pricey - it's at the airport. But what a great hangout, Tammy delivered excellent service, food was delicious, beer was cold!"}
{"text":"Bland and boring.  Whats with the fries?! No body in the world wants mexican food with fries.  A bad representation of Phoenix in an impressionable location.  Besides the sub average flavor the tradion of bad attitudes and slowness from the employees carries on from the 16th st location to the airport.  Never again Barrio. Dont believe the hype."}
{"text":"The Chiles en Nogada was phenomenal! I've never reviewed an airport restaurant before because I never thought they were anything special. Barrio Cafe is worth it.  I got the Chiles en Nogada, which is a \"roasted poblano pepper filled with chicken, dried fruits, apples and pears all in a delicate almond cream reduction.\" I was floored with how good it was. Pricey at $26, but wow. Amazing taste, texture, and presentation.  My girlfriend got the Tacos de Pollo Poblano, which include \"grilled spiced chicken breast, roasted poblano peppers, caramelized garlic and onion, tomatillo cream reduction, goat cheese, pine nuts, and crema Mexicana.\" Delicious and filling at $14.  To top it off, our server Carma was attentive to us and every table around us. She made the hectic dinner rush look like no big deal. A true professional. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Save your time and frustration! 35 minutes to get a cup of coffee and French toast. Aloof attitudes, slow service, cold food... Yikes!!! What a bad experience... again.. I won't make this mistake a third time and I fly 40x/yr."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times only because of It's convenience to my terminal. Of these times, I can honestly say that 3 out of 4 waitresses were extremely grumpy and not nice. I have been let down by the food each time. I think the first time I ordered a salad and noted how little protein was given, the second time I had nachos and they put blue cheese on them which tasted horrible, the third time a different salad which I was equally as disappointed about, and this last time I ordered shrimp tacos. They put 1 shrimp in each taco. Yes, you read that correct  : 1 shrimp for a total of 3 shrimp for a total of $17.00 plate. I've had enough of this place and heaven forbid I have to fly out of this terminal again. I'm sure I will, but I'll walk over to a different terminal to eat."}
{"text":"While I do love Barrio Cafe, the airport location has fairly poor service. It took forever to get a waitress to my table, and then I had to ask three times and several people for water with my meal. I will say I ordered the Mexican prepared soup and it was fabulous. I believe the food is at least four stars, but the pricing is quite high and service inconsistent at best. They need to get this right as the regular restaurant locations, at least the food, is five stars."}
{"text":"I was desperate for food during my layover a the Phoenix airport and fell upon Barrio Cafe.  Not many vegan or vegetarian options.  I ended up ordering some kind of veggie sandwich, which was okay.  It came with this delicious yellow sauce that made the sandwich edible. I was told that it was tomatillo sauce- yea, I'm pretty sure that was inaccurate.    What was disappointing about this place was how unwilling they were to accommodate your dietary needs.  No substituions or changes... you order what's on the menu. That's it.  And no salsa or chips to start-- I was told they didn't even have traditional salsa in stock... Rather rude staff too.  And, of course, prices are quite inflated to properly exploit your hunger during your airport visit.  I encourage you to bring some snacks before going to this airport."}
{"text":"Came here on a layover and noticed that the restaurant next door got 4 stars. Well, we have not  had mexican food for a while and decided to try it.  Food came out fast but cold. Service non existent after the food came out. Food was not bad altho."}
{"text":"For an airport resto, this place rocks! On my recent layover I had an excellent breakfast. The thick-cut bacon was wonderful, my eggs were cooked to perfection and the potatoes had great flavor and crunch. They have French press coffee, which is pretty cool given the location of this place. Add a touch of top-notch service and an ice-cold beer, and this was the breakfast of champions."}
{"text":"Just had weirdest experience.  Wanted to get beer b4 flight.  Somebody had roll-on at bar between two seats.  Was told couldn't stand at bar in space occupied by somebody's roll-on.  Can not stand at bar. Must have seat.  Currently enjoying IPA at LGO. Standing!"}
{"text":"Come into Phoenix often for our layovers and travel frequently thoughout the country, so I'm absolutely familiar with over priced mediocre airport food. This place was a delight on my palate, the michelada mix was authentic and full of flavor, they had to have used ground red dehydrated chile in the mix and on the rim; totally worth having two! My wife ordered the green pozole woth a tomatillo base, I thought it was going to be tangy and water (true to airport style food) and I was absolutely wrong, the caldo (soup) was delicious, hearty and absolutely full of flavor; the prok was tender and garnishes were the cherry on top. I had the green chile pork burrito which was also really good, they top off the burrito woth extra green sauce which made it even better. Wasn't too spicy which is normally a downfall for me but becauae the burrito and chile verde weren't lacking on flavor there was jo need for extra salsa. For an airport restaurant this was and will be one of my top picks! I understand people complaining about price, but get over it, you're in an airport and everything you buy past those tsa lines are going to be way over priced, so sit back and enjoy your overpriced beer and fairly priced airport meal. Our server was also attentive, friendly and brought us everything we needed before we even asked. :) happy airport hopping people"}
{"text":"The airport doesn't leave many eating options and this was what looked like the best of the bunch.  They have a typical type of choose your container then meat then toppings. I had the pork in a bowl with rice and beans, the helping was pretty ample for the moderately high prices.  There weren't many seats but we squoze in a small table that opened up!   I hate airport eating but this was pretty satisfying"}
{"text":"Ridiculous excuse of a restaurant and being from AZ...it's embarrassing. Taking gouging to a new level. We asked our server for chips & salsa while we waited, she said \"sure, but I have to tell you it's a little bag with just a few chips and a small cup of salsa for $9.00. Really? The service was average, food - exceptionally average and the prices...? Def not going back."}
{"text":"Nice surprise, rarely do you ever find good Mexican food in a airport. (Actually I have never) until now  . This is a do over. Wish this was a restraint back In albuquerque !! Would recommend ! The Arizona burrito was great !"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday AM at ~6:30 AM. Place was empty. Me = only customer. Only positive was the service....and I question that because the server had to see the lack of quality on the plate that was set before me...and still left it. So here is what my $20  bought me (includes tax and tip)...  Ordered Omelette Mexicali and a soda.. I do not know what was specifically wrong with the eggs, but they were not right. I think the menu states three eggs...yeha right...unless they meant quail eggs. Kind a watery on top of it.  A \"little\" toss of cheese on top.  The pico on the plate was old. Seriously? I appeared to be the first customer of the day and they give me this old stuff? Yuk!  The potatoes were disgusting. Ate two bites.  They were old, wrinkly and soggy. They had a funny taste to them that I could not place. I almost had to use the air-sick bag on the plane when I was thinking \"Why did I eat those?\". Oh..the toast was good with the packaged butter and jelly.  They are NOT getting any more of my money...ever. I am OK paying airport process for food, but if it is disgusting like this then shame on them!!!   Please go out of business so another place can have a shot at that spot."}
{"text":"Not bad at all, especially for overpriced airport food!  Margaritas are good and strong, perfect for a delayed flight. Barrio is a very pleasant surprise for the airport where I am used to eating crappy $10 sandwiches. Coffee is french pressed and very tasty, even for coffee snobs."}
{"text":"Ordered the quesadilla that described shrimp cheese etc. Came presented as a flat open faced taco- picked it up to take a bite and it was all crunchy! The shrimp was cooked with a full shell burried in the quesadilla - OMG had to pick out each shrimp to eat separate from the \"quesadilla\". Just an awful experience. The flavor was good and good had been a good dish - epic fail on execution. PS- Waitress came by to ask how everything was - I shared and was told \" I don't know - I just work here\" \"That's just how they make it\"....F for customer service too"}
{"text":"The food was okay, not bad and not great! The prices are astronomically high even for a restaurant at an airport, $15 for 3 mini tacos and $6 for an 8 oz. horchata (rice water) drink. The cup was filled with approximately 80% ice. While this would simply cause me to never visit the restaurant again for providing little value in the equation, I write this review to warn others of a more egregious problem. When I asked the waiter for a refill, he asked if I wanted to purchase another drink and I said no, I simply want more as the cup was mostly ice and for $6, I expected more. He argued that he did not set the amounts nor was he responsible for establishing the price.   Perhaps, my expectations of adequate service in this day and age are not realistic but to have a business operate in this way with their customers seems right down nasty! While the general discourse in our society sinks deeper in the gutter, one would expect for a business that relies on customers frequenting their establishment, the common sense approach would call for a decent treatment even if there's a disagreement on the value one receives. While I know competition is limited at an airport and I know there are many out there like myself, I will never shadow their doorway and surmise many that have a similar experience will rather opt to starve."}
{"text":"The service and food are great. Pollo poblano! So delicious along with the organic margarita. Our server was very knowledgeable of the recipes. Very good!"}
{"text":"Phoenix Sky Harbor has it all over other airports- delicious food!  Was served a tasty salad of fresh ingredients- spinach, roasted tomatoes, crumbly blue cheese, apples, nuts and spiced chicken breast in a lovely vinaigrette.  The draft Negro Modelo was cold and perfect with the salad.  Marina's service was delightful!   This experience was the exact opposite of the crap we were served in Orlando yesterday."}
{"text":"I should have known better, but just avoid. Expensive for very below average, tasteless and sloppy food and somehow horrible margaritas."}
{"text":"Everytime I stop at the PHX airport I make it a point to stop at the Barrio Cafe. They have exceptional margaritas especially there \"Lowrider\" margarita. There food is also really good especially for airport food."}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in the entire airport!  I had the chicken tacos with verde cream sauce.....fantastic.  Friendly people and perfect SW cuisine!  Pricey but it's the best kept secret at the Sky Harbor airport in Phoenix!!!!!!!!!!!  Many of my friends always come to the Barrio Cafe!"}
{"text":"Kevin, the bartender should probably find work that does not involve contact with other humans. What a joke...seriously can not understand how he would be hired...I blame Managment for that one. Food was pretty good. The Suizas was delicious and my waitress was very attentive for how packed it was for the 4th travel Rush. Sit away from the bar and you should be fine. Would have been 4 stars if he wasn't involved. Best bet may be for you to pack a lunch."}
{"text":"Best Airport food I have ever tasted.  Table side guacamole a must have!"}
{"text":"Airport food can be sometimes iffy at best, but we decided to eat at Barrio Cafe because it was one of two restaurants near our gate.   The decor is not bad considering we're in an airport, and the volume level is louder than most areas due to everybody being compacted in a small area and drinking beers.   Our server was Lori. I wasn't too impressed with her. She was all business and it was clear that she was only there to take our order and fill our drinks. The restaurant was busy as it was lunch time, but it doesn't take much to smile and pause an extra second or two.   I ordered the chicken quesadillas. I was expecting a quesadilla in the traditional sense of two tortillas with cheese melted in between. What I got was more of a street taco with melted cheese and chicken on top. 4 small tortillas with 4 small pieces of chicken. NOT worth the $16.50 we were charged. The food definitely was flavorful but unfortunately the service just made the whole experience very bland."}
{"text":"i ended up at the bar in the barrio cafe in the phoenix airport on january 3, 2014 during the Polar Vortex.  the bar was crowded with fellow stranded travelers.  i sat at of those tall bar tables with 5  guys who were all waiting for their flights to depart or arrive. the service at the bar was extremely efficient in spite of the overwhelming number of customers. no one waited any length of time for a drink to be delivered. one of our fellow lost sheep ordered the Nachos Barrio. everyone stared at it as it looked like an incredible mess, and yes, it was a mess. there was blue cheese, some kind of meat that should not be on a nachos, for $17.00. do not order the Nachos Barrio."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there. I arrived around 9:30 wasn't to impressed with the breakfast menu. I had a great server Anna. I had a drink called Chata which was delicious but pricy for a small glass. I had to wait till 10 to order off the lunch menu. I ordered the tacos de Camaron. I was very disappointed do not recommend them at all. Very small one shrimp on each taco, no flavor. I had to dump Tapatio and it still tasted like I was just eating corn tortilla with fried batter. Anna did offer me something else but I didn't have time to wait for them to make something new. I had to catch my plane. The star is for Anna"}
{"text":"The food is good as always. Checked in and seated quickly. Wait staff looks unhappy and by the end of the meal seem to be rushing people to leave so the next group can be seated. Love the food but a little dissatisfied with the service"}
{"text":"Below average food.  Slow-to-average service.  Forget ordering anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I had an excellent breakfast type burrito here, I was surprised how good it was.  The coffee was really weak and nutty, looked like tea but that could be the way folks like it in Phoenix.  Good service too."}
{"text":"Coming back from San Diego I was hungry not starved. Since the Barrio Café was near my gate I stopped in looking for something cold to drink and nothing too heavy to eat. The menu was chock full of belly stuffers and just before giving up I spied the Posole Verde Soup. It was deliciously described as: Pork, hominy. Roasted tomatillo and poblano soup topped with shredded cabbage, sliced radish, and diced onion. What a fabulous choice. The large chunks of oh so tender pork, the spices, and the wonderful broth was off the charts. I added some hot sauce and bingo it went from a solid 8 to a 10.  This was one of my best airport restaurant experiences to date. I just wish I had a thick slide of coarse bread to sop up the remaining broth!!!! Service was great at the bar. The bar stools are kind of funky as the cushions are too thick and soft you feel like one false move and you will flip off."}
{"text":"Nice \"fancy\" restaurant in phx. Great staff, excluding the hostess, great wine pours, but the barrio salad tasted like it was dragged thru the barrio streets before being plated. It sounds promising but the favors taste awful. Get something else."}
{"text":"The food options at this airport are not great.  But if you avoid this place, do.  The food is terrible.  They should be embarrassed serving this rubbish.  The people who work here on the other hand are great!  I feel bad they have to serve this \"food\"."}
{"text":"$15 for a top shelf margarita on the rocks and the mix was so terrible I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Waitress took 15 minutes before I flagged them down. They took my order but no follow up and waiting another 10 minutes to get my check. I had the chicken nachos which were average. Did not like my drink the Sergio. Was way heavy on the tequila and not refreshing and light which is what I was hoping with the fruit juice and mint."}
{"text":"I've been to many airport restaurants through the years as a business and personal traveler. This is on the better end of those eateries. The menu is fairly diverse and everything looks delicious, not warmed up in a microwave in back.  I was seated in a lounge area I hadn't seen when I was waiting for a table. I was the only one in the room for quite a while. There were two sofas, a high top table wrapped around a post and my high top. Two TVs were off and I overheard a waiter say one was broken. I was worried I would be neglected but my waiter made sure I wasn't.  I wanted a snack so ordered the nachos with chicken and a Cadillac margarita, rocks salt. OK, it was a bit heavy for a mid-afternoon snack but I had skipped lunch.  The nachos were good but the homemade chips were quite chewy, not crunchy. I found it a bit challenging to eat. The flavors were all over with bleu cheese, goat cheese, chorizo and a creamy cheese fondue. I liked the look of the dish more than how it tasted.  The margarita was super strong.   The menu has quite a bit and it's unique Mexican food so it's on the upper end of airport food. Even though I wasn't thrilled with my meal, I liked the ideas coming together and want to try more the next time I'm in Terminal 4, D section.  The discrepancy in reviews is amusing. Airplane travel is stressful and time is limited. Of course a sit-down restaurant like this with a higher end menu is going to take time or the understaffed wait staff will neglect people. Have to take the low reviews with a grain of salt.  I saw the tall beers and was envious of those who ordered them. Next time."}
{"text":"Give it 3.5 stars. Service is really quick I got my food in about 5-10min. I had the Arizona burrito. It was pretty good. Filled with tender pork topped with green chili. The green chili was flavorful. I would recommend. The fish tacos looked good too."}
{"text":"Overpriced, even for an airport ($24 for a glass of Sonoma Cutrer Chardonnay?), inconsistent service (ice-cold fries and dirty wine glasses served up with a smile), and an \"iconic\" menu that probably will leave you scratching your head (Chilis en Nagoda? Cochinita Pibil? Comida Chingona? Ensalada Tata?).  Seriously, is this the kind of food you want if you only have a 30-minute stopover before getting on a 3-hour flight?  Perhaps if you're feeling lucky and adventurous, but me?  Not."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just me being sick, but other said the same. Their signature dish wasn't all that fantastic. Pricey, but hey, what do you expect at the airport. The Jack Daniels Sangria was tasty."}
{"text":"Really slow service, even the hostess avoided welcoming us into the restaurant! If you crave just something simple, forget it  sometimes some basic nachos would be great, or a chicken quesadilla maybe, but not here. How about counting 5+ servers, only 6 tables and they all walk by and say nothing!  Service is nothing short of extremely horrible.  Oh then chops and salsa, nope!!  No tipping is the only positive thing, that's only because its to be earned!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here.  Food is very low quality for price.  Manager was extremely condescending when a question was asked.  I have truly never dealt with someone who had such a large chip on their shoulder.   I originally asked the question of the server and told her I did not want to speak to the manager.  She sent him anyway.    I would suggest that she not have her manager intervene for her as he was not a good advocate but quite rude and condescending.   I would not suggest eating here.  LaGrange next door is much better in terms of quality and taste.   I understand it's quite difficult to find quality employees.  It's too bad this establishment has had to settle for someone who is not an advocate for customer service.  Approach makes all the difference.  Acting like a jerk and making statements that are condescending does not make a difference."}
{"text":"If they charge $11 for a tiny glass of friggin' Cadillac they'd better make it right. Boy, this place sucks. That is why I live in LA!"}
{"text":"The server seemed to think I was just a poor kid who wouldn't tip. So he was rude, took forever to bring my check and didn't even ask why I pushed my plate to the other side of the table with most of my food still on it. The Arizona burrito was a soggy pile of blandness.  Oh how tempted I was to prove him right on that tip."}
{"text":"It's always a nice surprise when you get through TSA without the humiliation of a body cavity check and find yourself with an unplanned extra half-hour before going through the routine of lining up for your Southwest Airlines flight. At least that's what spurred me on to give this cafe a try. I usually skip airport eateries since my track record with them is dismal worldwide. Take a look at my list if you don't believe me (list: http://bit.ly/2c4CL6X). This one appears quite popular as I must have tripped over at least three roller suitcases on the way to my tiny table.  Getting the server's attention was the biggest challenge since everyone looked like they were getting ready to take off. I didn't have time to have lunch at the office since I tried to squeeze in too many meetings before getting to Sky Harbor. Airport prices are a bitch but what the hell since I was expensing it anyway. I decided to order the $9.75 bowl of Posole Verde, which combined bits of pork, hominy, roasted tomatillos and poblano peppers into a nice broth and topped it with shredded cabbage, sliced radish, and diced onion (photo: http://bit.ly/2c4DwwD).  It was one of the better soups I've had, certainly at an airport terminal. I followed that with the $14 Tacos de Pescado, a trio of Tecate beer-battered fish topped with shredded cabbage and avocado slices, drizzled with a Baja aioli, and accompanied by a tiny side of baby greens (photo: http://bit.ly/2cxjFWm). They were pretty decent for bar bites but honestly not much more than that if you're expecting something close to your favorite taqueria. Anyway, I'm just glad Phoenix Sky Harbor has one decent dining option in Terminal 4.  FOOD - 3 stars...posole was good and flavorful, the fish tacos less than stellar AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it is the airport so guard your toes against aggressive travelers who pull their roller suitcases with indifference SERVICE - 2 stars...he disappeared when I needed to get going TOTAL - 3 stars...airport eating is a dicey proposition but this one is a cut above"}
{"text":"On a short stopover we were HUNGRY and had two choices in our terminal.  Barrio Cafe looked like they had seating available and hey, Mexican food!  We were seated and greeted and provided water right away.  Our server was friendly and attentive throughout our whole meal.   When I looked over the menu, I discovered it wasn't really your standard Mexican food and the husband was disappointed not to find beans and rice on any of the dishes.  We both ended up going with tacos,  I got the fish tacos and I think he got the chicken tacos.  All I know is they were FANTASTIC. Both came with a small green salad with a spicy vinagerette that was tangy and zesty.  The husband never gets vinegarette and he loved it. My tacos came with good sized slices of Avocado and were super tasty.  It was the perfect amount of food and my fish was battered and crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside.  We were skeptical when we ordered, but both agree we were very happy with the choice. If you're in Sky Harbor awaiting a flight, I totally recommend Barrio Cafe.  Its not your regular Mexican Restaurant, but the tacos are delish."}
{"text":"A must for airport goers! Here's the story: After a friendly encounter with the TSA, then followed by an uncomfortable find of a store called \"Indigenous,\" my stomach's attention was caught by a cafe called Barrio. My legs then followed suit as my stomach gave chase to the Mexican influenced aromas. I was greeted by friendly staff and fast service, but more importantly was the \"famous guacamole.\""}
{"text":"I enjoyed what they call their \"Arizona Burrito\". The (smallish) burrito is filled with an amazing mix of tender pork and cheese covered lightly with flavorful sauce. I opted for the garden salad side and it was a very good accompaniment.  My wife had the skirt steak street tacos and she loved them. She grades her street tacos on a tough curve. Order coffee and it comes to the table in a large french press. We chose Barrio Cafe only because we were very hungry on a recent layover and they  had open seats. Turned out alright.  Unlike many of the reviews below we experienced prompt and polite service. *I knocked off a star because a burrito should not cost $13.50 no matter how good it is."}
{"text":"Service issues ! Usually come here when I travel to AZ because the Mexican food is different and well prepared. This guy Pedro is so annoying and lazy. The place got pretty busy right after we arrived for breakfast . The young lady was seating people, taking orders, cleaning tables. She called out for help in both English and Spanish. He kept putting her off and never really made himself useful. Irritating!"}
{"text":"Ok, for an airport.  The Arizona burrito was pretty bland, but not bad.  I think there were four beers on tap, so you're lucky to get one good craft beer.  Food and beer is at an average price, which is always a shock in an airport.  My server was awesome though.    Bottom Line:  In a pinch, it's ok and won't break the wallet."}
{"text":"We came in expecting mediocre airport food. We were so surprised. The fish tacos are amazing. So are the french fries. It is also really nice because it is a sit down restaurant, so when you are worn out from traveling it is really nice to have someone else wait on you! :) The service is slow, but friendly. We will definitely be coming back here next time we stop through this airport."}
{"text":"Missed a flight at sky harbor and grabbed a Bloody Mary here while I waited. It was one of the tastiest Bloody Mary's I've had in a long time... our server was even cool enough to ask if I had any preferences with how I liked them made. May have to make grabbing a drink here a travel ritual."}
{"text":"1. My waitress provided great service and it weighted to the 3 stars.  2. Airport food is expensive, this is uber expensive for what you get I'm my opinion. $13 for not so great chips and ok guac.  3. The $22 dollar chicken enchiladas were pretty much bland."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I only had 30 minutes to eat before I had to get in line for my Southwest flight. I decided to see if I could get a quick lunch. I ordered their house burrito. Yum! The burrito is slow cooked, tasty with just a touch of spice. Their salsa was also delicious.  Decor is pleasant, colorful and there are good seats at the bar.  I was served quickly and finished just in time to pay the check with my American Express, walk over to the gate and get on my flight."}
{"text":"The Michelada was pretty tasty. The torts we Rude red to share was good but not the one we ordered.  Our waitress offered to have it remade but we had to catch a flight and service was slow.  It's expensive but what do you expect from a restaurant at the airport.  ."}
{"text":"Why do I always eat here? Food is just okay. Expensive and very slow service"}
{"text":"High end dining in the airport? Well personally I thought the menu was a little over the top but I did think the margarita (pink Chevy with sugar), homemade guac made table side, chips and salsa were really good. A bit pricey but service and food were good."}
{"text":"I recently tried out Barrio Cafe while on a layover in Phoenix, Arizona and I have to say... as expected, the food and drinks were far too overpriced for what they were. I ordered just a traditional margarita on the rocks with salt and in my mind, I imagined it to arrive in a big wide rimmed margarita glass but instead it came to me in a tiny quarter size larger than a shot glass! World's smallest margarita, mostly made up of ice. I then decided to try a chicken quesadilla and found it to be the exact opposite of what a traditional quesadilla is.... it was an open faced corn tortilla more like a tostada but limp... okay I guess it was a taco?? So strange. After tasting it I then realized they made the dish with cream cheese. So strange. Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"I was at the airport and wanted to eat a little something before my flight.  I decided on the guacamole.  It was fantastic!  There is even a little surprise of pomegranate seeds in it.  They prepare it table side and you can tell them how much or how little of each ingredient you want.  The chips were also good as was the ice tea.  The next time I am in town I will definitely go to the regular Barrio Cafe in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just as expensive and crappy as their main location. But it was the only place in the vicinity for booze. Then got hungry and had a salad that was 12 freakin dollars for hardly anything. What a joke. LAME!!! Stay away people!"}
{"text":"I'm an avid Yelp user, but I am not one to leave a review. This restaurant however, I felt truly deserved one. This was much more than a meal, it was an experience. From the genuine service, hundreds of different kinds of tequila, decor, feel, unique ingredients in their entrees, to their flavorful robust coffee! Every plate was served in an artistic manner with vibrant colors and different textures that had me excited to eat. We had the quesadilla de camaron borracho, chiles en nogada , and the filet mignon de mi tita and all 3 dishes were AMAZING!! You can't go wrong with any of the 3."}
{"text":"After a hectic morning which resulted in me missing breakfast I ended up in the Sky Harbor Airport around 1:00PM with a short one hour layover. The Barrio Cafe appeared to be the only restaurant that I could eat at and still see my gate. Needless to say, I was starving and everything sounded good. I had ordered the Arizona Burrito. It was... Well... Bland and distasteful... The meat had large chucks of hard inedible fat in it and lacked flavor. Even for airport food the Barrio Cafe is terrible. Service was mediocre the waitress was indifferent and preoccupied talking to her co-workers. I will never go here again. Even if this was the only place to eat I would rather go hungry until I land at my destination then eat at the Barrio...."}
{"text":"We ordered tableside guacamole, quesadilla borracha, and a Cadillac margarita. The table side guacamole is not worth it at all, not only the size and the taste, and the chips are thick and bland.  Also the Cadillac margarita was eh; I've had way better Cadillac margaritas. The quesadilla borracha was the best thing, yet it was still mediocre. Find a better place to spend your layover."}
{"text":"My husband and i just ate breakfast and it was good. After we paid $30 for breakfast I asked the lady behind the bar if she would fill my water contigo with ice so i could add water before we boarded our flight. She said \"Im not allowed\". I said \"really we just paid $30 for breakfast and you cant give me ice????\"    Good food the WORST service made me think that I won't eat again at Barrio cafe.  So disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty food fast service slow drink order non-existent. Prompt service button major failure prices way too high. Service slow....  Slave to airport food pathetic. Reminder to eat at home or before checking into airport. I finished my food before getting my drink the gal sitting next to me offered her water she hadn't touched... Finally got my $15 drink in a tiny cup... Ugh!"}
{"text":"I love Phoenix airport cuisine.   Green pork breakfast burrito was awesome. My only real complaint was I asked for a poached egg and was told I had to have fried or scrambled only. $30 for breakfast for 1, I would expect more than 2 egg options."}
{"text":"Horrible food, terrible service. Although acclaimed to be some of the best mexican food in the region I was fully disappointed with my experience at Barrio Cafe. I ordered the table side guacamole appetizer which was brought out following the the main dish only after I mentioned not receiving it. It also wasn't prepared table-side like the menu describes & the ingredients weren't even mixed together but instead thrown in unstirred. The \"iconic\" Cochinita Pibil tacos turned out to be so greasy & gross I couldn't stomach more than a bite. The ONLY thing I enjoyed about this experience was the artwork by Calle 16: Mural Project. Definitely don't recommend Barrio Cafe & won't be back."}
{"text":"Before today, I would have given this place a solid 4, maybe even 5 star review. I've been here many times for lunch and  dinner. I've even intentionally chosen to have my layover in PHX because I love the food at this place! That all came crashing down today...Breakfast was so gross! The hostess was super friendly. Our server was warm, friendly, and speedy. The food food was terrible. My husband and I both ordered the pork verde burrito with (scrambled) eggs. The pork has a strange gamy flavor and I actually wondered if the eggs were real!?! Something was very off and totally disappointing. My kids had the pancake kids meals. They were fine. For a $60 breakfast, I felt robbed. I know they can do better. I'll be sticking to the lunch and dinner menu from now on. The carne Asada or shrimp tacos with a side salad are delicious!"}
{"text":"Really flavorful light Mexican food. The pork tacos and pork burrito were great! A little odd to get steak fries with tacos at a Mexican place. The peach margarita was pretty good. It had a nice peach flavor with just a hint of the tequila in it. Defiantly not your traditional Mexican food but I loved that it was so light tasting before flying. Service was a little slow, but she was nice. Would try again when flying from Phoenix."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you what Barrio Cafe is like, but my experience wasn't very helpful.  While traveling, I was at Sky Harbor for a layover between flights and wanted to get some lunch. Barrio Cafe was right next to my gate, so I decided to go for it even though the prices were a little high.  I was seated quickly next to an older couple, and shortly after I was settling into my seat they had an appetizer delivered. I asked them what it was, because it looked quite good, and found out it was the tecate breaded fish and shrimp. I was tempted to grab it for a meal, and thanked them for letting me know.  I perused the menu. No server came by.  I plugged in my phone at the A/C outlet next to the table. No server came by.  The couple next to me finished their meal. No server came by.  The couple requested their check and their waiter dropped it off, then turned and walked away. No server asked if I had been helped.  The couple next to me paid their check and asked \"Has anyone even gotten you a drink yet?\"  I checked my watch. It had been 15 minutes since I was seated, and I had 20 minutes before my flight was supposed to start boarding.   I stood up to leave. The waiter who had come by to collect the check from the couple next to me asked how my meal was. I told him I didn't know, since no-one had ever taken my order.  He asked if I wanted to sit back down. I explained to him that I was concerned about missing my connecting flight, and that I really just wanted to get some lunch  quickly.  Instead of letting me go, he gave me a rather nasty look and said \"Well, if THAT'S the way you feel, SIR, maybe you /should/ go somewhere else.\"  I'm very, very glad I didn't give them my money, and if I'm going through Sky Harbor again, I don't intend to ever return."}
{"text":"Not only overpriced for too small of a portion (did expect that being in an airport), I did not anticipate the server being completely incompetent and rude! Needless to say, won't be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish tacos and they were good. As everyone has laminated very expensive. Great place to chill and relax while you are waiting to catch your flight. I'd go back if I was in the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"Prompt service but poor food quality. Carne Asada was served cold.  Steak was ordered medium rare and served sliced, well done, dry and not fresh. Tasted like it was precooked and sat under heat lamp for an hour. French fries were stale and cold. I realize this is an airport eatery but if you're going to charge $23 for an entree, it needs to be better quality. Service was not an issue."}
{"text":"This was one of the best breakfasts I've had. I was here a couple years ago when seeing the Grand Canyon. Had a Pink Cadillac with a SouthWestern breakfast of home fried potatoes mixed with peppers and onions, bacon, scrambled eggs. Yeah, I know...What's the big deal right? It's all in the flavor! Amazing flavor and our waitress was the nicest and funniest person. I like when wait staff and servers have a sense of humor. She was what we needed. So was the Pink Cadillac! BTW, Tons of Tequilla in that baby!"}
{"text":"#BarrioCafe #BarrioCafePorAvion #SeriouslyBadAssMexicanCuisine  I had the most delicious lunch on my way to San Francisco and the service was outstanding. Yolanda help me with the extensive menu and suggested my entree (allowing me to substitute the fries for a bed of spinach). I've been to the 16th street location twice while on vacation.   Carne Asada a la Ricardo: grilled skirt steak topped with caramel used onions, green onions, mushrooms, jalapeños, garlic and chorizo all over a pile of Barrio spicy fries with an avocado and pick del Gallo. $23   Organic: Tierras Organic Silver Tequila, organic agave nectar, pomegranate and grapefruit juice, and fresh lime with salted rim $14.25  Chata: award winning Agua de Horchata, Crema 1921 and Kahlua"}
{"text":"If you have time in Phoenix airport, come to The Barrio Cafe! I love this place. This is the most inspired menu I've ever seen in my domestic travels, and the artwork is awesome. Is that a Chihuly light? The food is great, and there is an interesting cocktail menu. This is not just an over-priced beer and burger place. I love flying through Phoenix with a layover so I can come here. My favorites are the nachos (unexpected sweet and savory flavor), fish tacos, and seafood enchiladas. Oh and the Cadillacs. :) mucho gusto!"}
{"text":"Meh, food was fine, but overpriced (even for airport food). There looks like a disconnect between the male and female servers: the male staff looks very professional in shirts and ties, but the females (even with \"dress shirts\" and ties) don't look professional at all, more like what a high school girl would consider \"professional.\" (For more clarification, the men are dressed how you expect restaurant managers to dress, while the women were a tad on the sloppy or too-casual side). My server (well, most of the female servers) was inattentive, bringing me a refill for my drink when I was clearly finished with my meal, and all of the women seemed to congregate near the kitchen or next to the bar to chat and joke. There were far too many waiters and waitresses, and they could definitely make do with fewer."}
{"text":"Rating was due to service experience with wait staff.  Host staff were on point, give those girls kudos!  Coffee - fabulous"}
{"text":"Not bad food, but nowhere close to worth the price. This is a sit down restaurant so plan on staying about 45 minutes for a meal. Located in the D gates of terminal 4 at Sky Harbor.  Again, the food was good and the service was alright but I will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"Good service and good posole verde.  Will order again when I am in terminal D at the Phoenix airport."}
{"text":"This seems like a mailed in effort from one of my favorite local chefs.  My breakfast sandwich was absolutely average and exceptionally messy given the fact that you are likely going to be eating it off your lap.  The bread was heavy and bland; I wound up discarding it.   One general complaint about the overall new restaurant plan.  I am absolutely a fan of the local restaurants in the airport but as I was in the Southwest terminal I couldn't find any reasonably priced dishes.  I find that interesting given the fact that the Southwest terminals are usually ground zero for families and young kids.  I feel bad for the mom of 4 who has no option but to spend $15 for some french toast at Barrio or LGO.  What happened to  the cheaper options?"}
{"text":"Surprised to find Barrio Cafe here in the D.  Great breakfast, could not pass it up.  Bustling eatery serving creative Mexican fare & over 200 tequilas in cozy digs filled with folk art. Offerings Alcohol Beer Cocktails Coffee Comfort food Happy hour drinks Happy hour food Hard liquor Small plates Vegetarian options Wine  Best damn Taco's!"}
{"text":"Does anyone know how to get in contact with this restaurant? I was charged 2 different times, one for $53.07 which was my bill total and another for $63.90 which was not bill. The drinks were great and it was close to my gate but not paying someone else's tab also lol"}
{"text":"The story is as good as the food itself.   I'm going out on a limb here and saying this place deserves 5 stars just on the nachos alone. I know the signature dish is the puerco pibil, this will have to wait till my next visit. I was pleasantly surprised to have fresh spinach and blue cheese on my nachos platter. The cheese tasted like it was gourmet home made cheese. I like the story how authentic Mexican dishes with French influence plays a roll in the dishes served. Keep in mind this was what they served at the Phoenix Airport location. I really need to stop by the downtown location. My only complaint if I had one was the price being a little on the high side. $40 for two beers and a nachos plate. Honestly, you get what you pay for here though. I would totally do it again!  Great job Barrio Cafe!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious . Food was hot. Breakfast was fantastic! Yum totally eat here again"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing lunch! I had a long layover here and took one look at the menu before deciding this was my kind of Mexican food! The server sat me with all my luggage towards the back left side of the restaurant where it was nice and quiet. I ordered the shrimp and avocado salad and enjoyed every bite. I can easily say avocados are my favorite lunch fruit/veg and they are not commonly served in airports!  When I got done with my lunch I was able to plug in my laptop and get some work done - what a pleasant surprise Phoenix airport had to offer me this trip! Thanks to Barrio Cafe for easing the burden of traveling just a little bit. My server was super nice and left me alone when she saw that I was working. When I needed to checkout she was quick to run my card and get me out to my flight."}
{"text":"High prices, slow service.  15 bucks for a pollo poblano burrito with fries. Choice of salad or fries. After 15 min of waiting, I received my burrito with a salad. So I asked for my fries. They simply scraped the salad off the plate and plunked fries on top of the balsamic mess. My burrito was soggy, mediocre amount of chicken, and the vinegar taste was strong. Another thing I didn't like was that if you order takeout you cannot sit in the seating area. Dine in only. It's an airport. I don't have time to wait for someone to bring me a check when I'm trying to catch a plane. I'm not stopping here again. Pizza Hut probably would've been worth the walk...another note, the drinks in the cold case were warm so they had a bucket on the counter with ice. This ensured colder drinks but it was crowded and I almost pulled a muscle trying to lean over to get the drippy water on the other end of the counter.  I don't understand why the cashier couldn't have just handed me one as she saw me struggle. Just a negative experience all around. :( See pix."}
{"text":"I begrudgingly hate going to the airport, but be-still my heart... There's a Barrio Cafe here! I was so excited about my find, I spent my time enjoying a delicious plate of Chiliquiles Verdes while waiting for my flight to depart.  The Chiliquiles Verdes cheered me up right away. The tortillas had a crispy texture that was just the right amount of thickness. The baked seasoned tortillas supported the weight of the rich ranchero sauce that embraced them.  With all this carb loading, the French Pressed coffee prevented me from falling into a deep food coma so I didn't miss my flight!  Barrio Cafe definitely helped kick off my morning to a great start!"}
{"text":"Food was good but service was terrible. Had a server named Victor. I ordered a margarita with no salt and it came out with salt. I let him know I had ordered no salt and asked for a new one. He took my drink, walked away, and then I watched him take a napkin and wipe the rim of my glass and bring it back. I really hate salt so I told him I saw him just wipe the glass, but instead of apologizing and getting me a new, fresh drink he got attitude and said I needed to taste the drink to see if I tasted the salt! Are you kidding me - how unprofessional. He then got attitude with my friend who was with me and asked if she had something to say also.  I will never go back - decent tasting taco but that kind of service is inexcusable!!"}
{"text":"First, I hate leaving below par reviews for any place I go but I will be fair in this review.   A nice Airport restaurant with a decent menu. I can't fully review this restaurant as we were only served drinks.  The margaritas were good, not the best I've ever had but they held their own. Prices were ok, for being a Terminal restaurant, pricey for other standards. We were seated quickly and the hostess was nice. Our server came to the table some time later and we ordered two margaritas. My wife ordered the pink one and I ordered the spicier one, can't remember the names of them now as its been a few weeks.  The restaurant was busier so it took alittle time to receive our drinks and the server was ok. After we got our drinks our server went on her break, which isn't a problem at all, but the server that took over for her was absent. I mean, we never saw him/her. We would have had another round but after waiting 30 minutes with no server even after hitting the call button on the table we finally hit the Payment button. Still, no server, we finally had to wave another server down just to get our bill.  Overall I could do without going back to this spot, though the margaritas were good they aren't worth the wait."}
{"text":"After two visits - terrible.  Cochinita Pibil tacos dry and tasteless.  And with French fries!  Guacamole should be advertised as chopped (at least as well as you can with a spoon by a server who told us it was a pain to do guacamole tableside when it was busy!) avocado not guacamole.  Service seemed just plain uninterested.  Prices not justified at all for what you are going to experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times for Breakfast and Lunch. Normally the service can be challenging and a bit understaffed. Today it was that and the food came out cold. First time sending it back. I will say the server was nice and the replacement food was on point. Glad we had plenty of time."}
{"text":"Don't go if you are a penny pincher but if you like flavorful food with some creativity this is a great place. Not a burrito style Mexican food. The fish tacos were incredible and the slow roasted pork in banana leaf was the best Removing all star as server was highly rude and un professional"}
{"text":"Two strikes you're out Barrio Cafe. I love supporting local businesses and have been so pleased to see the arrival of so many to the airport but when I'm at the airport I must put efficiency first. This is where barrio Cafe sadly fails. In the future I will stop in for a drink but I will only sit at the bar and nothing more. This is because the service is sadly some of the worst I've experienced. On two separate occasions I've eaten here and both times the lack of service have almost cost me to miss my flight. After serving the food the wait staff seems to disappear and it's impossible to find them. I would ask and ask and then when I note my need to hurry for fear of missing my flight I have been snidely commented to by the staff. The food and drinks are good but I think the customer service and efficiency needs major improvement if they want to be successful in an airport environment."}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing special. Slow, spotty service. The food is 3-Star. The service, 2-Star. The price 1-Star. The price alone will haunt you."}
{"text":"Sampling the menu here at the airport. Got the chicken burrito plate. It was really good they give you a lot of chicken in the meal. Chicken was grilled and well seasoned. Also ordered the guacamole side."}
{"text":"I will preface this as it is good for airport food... But.... I imagine the airport location is not doing the legacy very good. The food is good... Except dried cranberries in the guac??? :/ (I ate around those). Chips were stale.. I think someone else mentioned that also and my posole was cold. I saw someone else commented on cold food so looks like they have a little problem. Also the waitress was completely overwhelmed and it wasn't that busy, but To her defense I think she was the only waitress in the whole place and she was hustling and very sweet. Overall... Wasn't bad and flavors were good and authentic, but when you say things like world famous on your menu it kinda sets the bar pretty high. If they hadn't I may not have been so disappointed."}
{"text":"Cochinito pibil is phenomenal. Melt in your mouth pork. Very, very flavorful. It also comes with a marinated onions, salsa, and savory (smashed) potatoes. I was skeptical at first, but it blew my nomnomnom mind at first bite. Wow... Some of the best Mexican food I've had."}
{"text":"I was pressed for time and wanted to eat somewhere with table service in between flights. With only 3 stars in Yelp, I was a little hesitant, but I didn't have time to look all over for other restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised!!  I was greeted immediately by the pleasant hostess who seated me right away. My server was super kind and helped me with any questions I had, giving suggestions along the way.  I ended up getting the fish tacos and I'm so happy I did!!! The plate had 3 tacos stuffed full with fried mahi mahi and avocado on corn tortillas. It came with a lovely side salad with delicious balsamic vinaigrette.  Great service! My water glass was always full. My empty plates were promptly cleared. My check was brought immediately when I asked."}
{"text":"If you're in the airport, definitely go here! I love this place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The service is extremely fast and the food is actually really good for airport food. I always get a traditional two egg breakfast which comes with meat, potatoes and toast. Can't go wrong there. The steak tacos: AMAZING! What a hidden gem. The only negative is that I think the fries are way too over seasoned. Someone in the back has a heavy hand! Of course it is pricey, but it's the airport so that is to be expected. This is my go to spot when I fly out of Phoenix, and I travel a lot."}
{"text":"Heck ya... one of my all time favs comes to Sky Harbor!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, worst service ever even for an airport, waited 15 minutes an no one showed.   Went back after realizing no where else close to get food and beverage. Seriously then listened to wait person complain about I was guy who left and complained of lousy service. So they waited on me immediately?   No said we'll be right with you after I'd already been sitting 10 minutes  If you're going to bitch about your customers, maybe choose not within their hearing range?!? Wow  yep worst service ever to go with over priced food and watery Bloody Mary . Try and get at least one thing right"}
{"text":"Nice little spot within the Southwest Terminal of the airport, the food is pretty good all things considered, they do have some hybrid food mixing Mexican and American influences.  I had a dish that had french fries in it, was pretty decent.  If I was in the terminal, I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Very nice looking in-airport restaurant and the service at the bar is above average. However my breakfast experience was terrible. I order the chilaquiles and when they come out, they look different from what I'm accustomed. I give them a try anyway as they do look appetizing. Turns out the tortilla was cold, almost as if it had been just pulled out of the packet. I ask the waitress if that's how the dish was meant, since I'd never seen chilaquiles assembled in this format and she said no and took it back. When she returns the tortillas were warm but my over medium egg was also now fully cooked. I ate 1/2 and then notice my potatoes have 2-3 small chunks of pork meat. Btw, I don't eat pork and the dish did no describe to include any meat. I confirm with the waitress again and her simple response was, it must have just slipped in. All-in-all, I'd avoid this place for food but would give it another go for drinks."}
{"text":"I was craving burritos so I figured I would stop here to eat since it was near my gate.  FOOD: okay The GUACAMOLE was probably the best thing we had.  They make it fresh for you at table-side so you can request what you want or don't want in it.  The CHIPS are kind of hard though, so after awhile, my jaw started to hurt. haha!   SERVICE: so-so At first, the waiter was on top of everything -- friendly, patient, attended to our table quickly.  But after we got our food, the service was horrible.  Our water glasses remained empty, it took forever to get our check, and forever to get our card back.  The waiter seemed to be too busy flirting with the hostess or something.  I guess he didn't come here to work....  PRICE: typical for the airport"}
{"text":"Too many drain flies for me. Food was cold. Bloody Mary was oh so nasty. Move onto another terminal or go to La Grande Orange."}
{"text":"Big fan of Bario in town.  Ordered a margarita and the glass it came in could almost pass for a shot glass.   $10.00 later.... a shame for so little."}
{"text":"Food is usually excellent.  Small portions.  My gripe......10.00 for chips and salsa!!,,!,!,!,,,!!,!omg.  If you want to be a fucking Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, charge 14.00 for three small street tacos, and charge customers for a bowl of chips and salsa.  I will walk to the other establishments in in C or A.  You seem to have lost sight of your roots.  If I spend 35.00 for drinks and food, 2.00 worth of chips and salsa seem to be a no brainier.  I can understand if they order a water and chips and salsa but not for paying customers!!!! Never again barrio!"}
{"text":"Last day of our business trip and one of the guys just wanted to get to the airport and drink as you can loose your job if you get a DUI while on business. So straight to the airport it was and since it was on the companies dime, we're going to pay the outrageous airport meal fees.  The margaritas must have been good or the guys were thirsty because they tanked the first one and took it easy on the second.  Good customer service. We weren't rushed as all the business travelers were starting to pour in.   I thought my fried shrimp and fish dish was really good and it appeared my co-workers enjoyed their meals as well.  As we were leaving, as crowded as it seemed, we could still get through without tripping over the other customers with our hand carry in tow.  One thing I was mostly impressed with, the murals on the wall. Even my tatted co-worker thought it was tastefully done and fun.  I would definitely have a meal here again if I ever have to go through this Southwest terminal again."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I visited the the one in Phoenix. Amazing food, decor, and service. I had the filet mignon, the infamous guacamole, and flan. Wow, and it's rare that I end with desert. Get there before 5pm, place fills up quickly. I love the murals on the parking lot walls. It reminds me of home (Philly). I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Ummmm.... I almost do not want to review this place, but must give you the warning to avoid it IF you can.   So hopefully you will read this before stopping by. Worst breakfast I have had. Airport food has improved significantly in the past 10-20 years. Not this one.    Wait for lunch which starts at 10:00, they say it's much better.  Service was nice though. So the staff deserves a 3 star."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a drink and some  Mexican food while waiting for a flight. The server was busy so the service was kind of slow but we were not in a hurry so all is good. The beers  were cold and the Guac was delish!"}
{"text":"I don't expect a whole lot from airport food, but this place is downright terrible. Especially when you consider the cost of the food!  We were sat promptly, but the hostess didn't bring menus (she seemed SUPER uninterested in her job), so when the waitress showed up a minute later, we were already frazzled trying to order drinks, but we made it. She took our drink order and thankfully gives us time to look things over for our food order.  When our waitress came back with our drinks, she joked that she didn't take a sip...ok...haha...but maybe she should have. My $10 original margarita was nothing more than water and lime. There wasn't even a hint of a taste of tequila in it. My husband's $14 margarita wasn't any better. For the cost, I shouldn't have to guess if the bartender remembered to put tequila in our drinks!  We attempted to find out waitress so we could ask for our drinks to be remade. She was no where in sight. In fact, we couldn't get anyone's attention.  Not willing to find out if our $17 tacos would be equally as bad, we left.  If you want weird and not great service, and terrible and terribly overpriced drinks--this place is for you! Not sure how the food is...so eat at your own risk."}
{"text":"I decided to try Barrio out while waiting for a Sunday evening Southwest flight back to California. It was a great place to relax and enjoy a drink and salad for 45 minutes while waiting on a flight. Cocktails were expensive but that's to be expected in the airport restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Inside the airport at the 'D' Gates, you will find two restaurants with sit down options. Barrio Cafe is one of them, but they lure you in because in addition to standard tables and chairs, they also have couches and lounge chairs.  Sign at the entrance says wait to be seated, but with only two wait staff running around a considerable area, I wasn't optimistic one of them would greet and seat me. Eventually, after a minute wait, a waiter with a smile on his face, yelled across the room as he was delivering someone's order, \"Seat yourself, anywhere is fine.\"  I found a nice two-seated, black leather couch in the corner. I occupied one of the seats, and my bags the other. A friendly waitress made her way to my area after about five minutes and delivered a menu and took my drink order. I wasn't that hungry, but I felt I might be on the verge of a migraine, so getting water to take my meds was paramount to me. I also ordered a Coca Cola to help give me a jolt of energy. I think I waited another 5 minutes for the drinks to arrive.  When you are in pain and wanting to take your meds, the wait for water is exceptionally noticeable.  The menu didn't really have anything appealing, so I ordered $10 guacamole from the appetizer menu. I was intrigued that mashed avocados could be listed at that price. Apparently you pay for the entertainment value. The waitress wheeled a cart that looked more like the bus boy cart in front of my coffee table and asked me if I wanted all of the ingredients. I said yes even though I had no idea what special ingredients might be included in this masterpiece. The waitress sprinkled, scooped and mixed about seven different items together, many of which I had no idea what they were. She then presented me with a small, red, mixing bowl with some mashed and some chunked avocado with bright red pomegranate seeds on top. This was highly unusual to me. I tried it, but the pomegranate seeds added to the mix didn't really do anything to enhance the flavor. I ate a few more bites to see if it would grow on me, but alas, I left the majority of the creation sitting in the bowl and promptly fell asleep on the couch using my bags as my pillow.  My waitress was kind enough not to disturb me, but she promptly attended to me when I awoke 30 minutes later asking if I wanted anything else. I told her that I wouldn't be getting anything else, but that I would be here for another 30 minutes since my flight was delayed. We settled the tab and I tipped her handsomely to compensate her for the loss of new customers that might have sat in her section on the couch.  The service was okay, the food selection and guacamole was...meh, especially considering the prices, the comfortable lounge seating was a nice perk, and with limited choices in this section of the airport, I might be forced to return, but hopefully not."}
{"text":"My daughter was ready to enjoy a fantastic lunch at this well-placed eatry. However, the way that she was treated was unconscienceable. My daughter is a beautiful brown-black girl who is open-minded and accepting of others. But these people who are descendents of immigrants from Europe, waiting on and serving my daughter wanted to strike a negative chord in the heart of a gentle soul. After their negative treatment, she left the restaurant telling them she did not want \"this.\" And by this meaning, not just the food, but that kind of treatment. I applaud her courage."}
{"text":"If your choice is to not eat and starve. Or eat here. Please choose to starve. Dirty and gross. Rude staff. And horrid inedible food. I don't usually do negative reviews but this place was that bad. Even for airport food. Worst I've ever had. There are far better choices at this airport. Please make a better decision than I did."}
{"text":"Save your time and money. Food was terrible and cold. Servise was the worst! Stay away!"}
{"text":"Eh what can I say, its airport food. This place is not the worst Mexican food I've had at an airport but it definitely wouldn't do very well as a regular restaurant. I had the carne asada tacos and thought they were quite bland. The cheese they added to them was more sad than anything and it was dry and crumbly. My boyfriend had the AZ burrito and it was again, just ok. What I found to be really weird was that they had no chips on the menu( or at least from what I saw ). My boyfriend got French fries instead of chips since that's what they offered. I thought this was a bit odd as the flavors clashed a bit. I'd probably try the place next door the next time I went to PHX."}
{"text":"One seat open at the bar but my wife and I couldn't use it because \"I have to have each person at the bar have their own seat\". When asked why the answer was \"because this is a dining area\". What a fucking joke."}
{"text":"Quick service and happy employees very friendly and the food is delicious and tasty!!!! Had their fish tacos must try with their salsa!!!!! Definitely I will eat there every time ill be in the airport before my flight!!!"}
{"text":"Had a couple hours to waste before the flight, so stopped here. Bacardi was our server, pretty chill with kind of a hippie vibe. The stars are mainly for her and her good service, because the food was just ok. THAT HORCHATA THO...yummers :)!!!!"}
{"text":"Was headed out of town for the weekend and thanks for a flight delay I had some time to kill and thought it would be cool to check out what Terminal 4 has to offer now so I checked things and out and made my way on over to Barrio Café.   Ok one of the things I like about Phoenix Sky Harbor, they are supporting locally owned restaurants and bringing them into the terminals for others to enjoy, I think it's a great thing. https://skyharbor.com/pdf/Terminal_4_L3_Current.pdf I like the look of Barrio Café, the art work is cool.   I think there is a lot of improvement to be made with the hostess and there crew, when I 1st got there I told the host I was a party of one, she gave some other person a menu and told them to sit me at the bar table area facing the people walking to their gates,  walked me to the spot, put menu down and walked away, not once did they check to see if this chair belonged to someone else, maybe the drink should tipped them off, told the person whose seat I just stole I was sorry, walked back up to the podium and gave them back my menu, then they put me at a table for 4 with 3 other guest who didn't even know each other, and this was a bench seat, so I had to ask the man if he would mind moving the bench so I could sit down.  This was not cool, I was so very close to saying screw this shit I'm out. Since I was at table with a bunch of strangers I didn't know and room was limited my idea of reading my book while eating a meal was no longer available.  Barely had room for my purse on the seat because everyone but me had a carry-on bag. Also at the table next to me a man was sat there, and he waited for about 10 minutes before anyone came to him so he walked up the bar to order his own beer, but when he left his table the host put 2 people at it, he came back and saw no room for him anymore.   Our server was Victor, he was a friendly guy just very over worked, I even heard him tell the host not to place anymore people in his area until he can clear some tables.  Again this is something I shouldn't be hearing.  Ok so I had some time to check out Barrio Cafes web site while waiting and learned 2 things, supposedly this is truly excellent, very authentic Mexican food and BC notes on its website that its food is not deliberately chile-hot, wants the flavor of the seasoniongs & spices to revel themselves.  So don't expect heat, no chips no salsa either.  After looking the menu over I went with the burrito pollo pablano , it had grilled chicken breast with roasted poblano peppers, caramelized onions & garlic with goat cheese and a cream reduction and had the choice of salad or spicy French fires (because spicy French fries are way more authentic than beans or rice?) I picked the side salad, it was salad greens with diced tomato and goat cheese on top of it with a balsamic dressing, it was good, enjoyed the flavors.  The burrito though, I had high hopes, the chicken looked like the stuff you can get at the store, the deli fresh grilled chicken breast, it was perfectly sliced with grill marks, had no flavor at all, the peppers, onions and garlic was bland, no flavor, the goat cheese didn't have that bite it normally has, the cream reduction was like a thin alfredo sauce but bland. This entire burrito lacked flavor & spice and not the heat type of spice.  I wasn't impressed with Barrio Café , even if it was the airport addition and not sure if I would wonder on over the downtown Phoenix location .  And I really wanted to like it, So thrilled that Sky Harbor is putting in locally owned places, just think they missed when they added this one, but good news is Los Taquitos is almost done being built."}
{"text":"We had a long layover today and had eaten here before. We walked all around Terminal 4 to explore the food choices, but ended up back here close to our gate. We kept thinking that we weren't that impressed with the food and prices last time; we should have listened to our gut. We ordered the guacamole and the cochinita pibil tacos (which they are known for). They first brought out the tacos piled high with fries, but we ordered a side salad. When they brought it back out, the side salad was so small. We were both shocked at how small it was. $14 for a taco platter and a tiny, tiny side salad is steep! The guacamole was not cheap either at about $12-13, and it had cranberries in it. Server was not very friendly. I recommend you go to one of the burrito/torta places in another gate area. It will be almost half the price."}
{"text":"The Good: +  Great service!  Really friendly staff and bartenders will help you pass the time. +  Extensive menu for an airport.    The Not So Good: -  The food was not good.  My chorizo was burnt to a char and it was supposed to be the star of the dish.  The redeeming factor was the sunny side up eggs. -  Incredibly expensive for what you get.  We get it, it's an airport.  But when you're paying close to 15 dollars for a plate of two basic eggs you're getting shafted. -  Slow service for food, quick service for drinks."}
{"text":"A bit overpriced but that is to be expected at the airport. Very good nachos! Amazing grapefruit margarita. They do not serve water at the table unless you ask. They try to sell you bottled water when you leave. Order the chips and guacamole. They make it at the table! Great service. I would eat here again"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and ordered the Barrio salad and house red. The salad was extremely fresh and with every bite you get an assortment of flavor. Honestly one of the best salads I've ever had, let alone in an airport. I travel once, sometimes twice, a week and I know airport food... This place raises the bar. When I'm back in Phoenix, I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"For airport food, this is pretty good. The prices are typical of airport prices but not crazy. I had a glass of wine and the steak tacos (3 tacos and french fries) and I paid about $23.00.  The service: I sat at the bar. The bar tenders were friendly, One Hispanic guy and a lady who had a lot of tattoos ( I don't remember their names lol). The guy was great. he was super friendly and helpful and just fun. The lady was a little more reserved; she seemed annoyed with one of the patrons but she wasn't serving me so whatevs. The guy who was serving me was helpful with suggestions and was quick with service.  The food: Eh. The tacos were alright; nothing to rave about by any means. They had steak, a cabbage slaw and pico on top. It came with a side of mild salsa. The fries were the best part. They are seasoned and steak cut. The menu is a good size but not a lot of variety.  The wine: great! hard to mess up Chardonnay.   Overall: If I was every in the airport again and wanted some mexican food I might stop here again. I don't think I'd spend that kind of money again on tacos though.  *shrug* I guess I won't be back."}
{"text":"Two words, SERVICE SUCKS! Plain & simple. I am personally embarrassed  for  people that I'm watching that are having to wait so long to even get service. I'm just stuck here because my flight is delayed."}
{"text":"On our way to Cabo and had 2 hours in the Phoenix airport so based upon a previous amazing experience hiked the 2 miles from our gate area to gats A/B to hit Barrio Café. Again it was amazingly good and for an airport restaurant that is something. Prices are decent. Food is tasty and ample. Service was attentive. Dos Equis Amber on tap. What more could you ask?  We actually liked it much more than the original Barrio in downtown Phoenix. We think you will too so give it a try. Oh, the Mexican food we had was every bit the equal to what we had in Baja."}
{"text":"I am such a picky eater, not one thing I want to eat.  Hope the soup is ok.  Soup was ok, but small.  I have to go find something else to eat.  Didn't get the $9 chips and salsa.  Great service by Bacardi."}
{"text":"Arizona burro was really great. ... strange it comes with fries or salad, should come with chops and hot sauce but fries were good too. Chipolte ketchup nice and spicy if you like chipolte."}
{"text":"I arrived super early for a flight and was looking for a place to enjoy some breakfast and a beer (way early in the morning). I happened upon Barrio cafe, which was right next to my gate. I sat at the bar, ordered a beer, and took a look at their menu. They don't have a very big selection, especially for breakfast. I can't fault them for that - they're a restaurant in an airport. They're also expensive - again, I don't fault them too much for that. The food came out quickly, the bartender was nice and helpful. It helped me accept that my vacation in Arizona was over."}
{"text":"The best part is the ketchup- it's a little spicy, has smoked flavor to it, overall very satisfying. However, guacamole, enchiladas and fish tacos were all lacking some binding component to taste good. Guacamole was freshly made basically in front of us. That's nice. But I'd add more cilantro and onion to it.  Enchiladas had too much butter. Really, butter was all I could taste pretty much. Scampi shrimp on top of them was very good but I wish the dish had more shrimp and less butter. Fish tacos were rather bland, unfortunately.  The murals are pretty cool and the service is quick. Summary on the food - good house made ketchup and scampi shrimp, good guacamole, but everything else is on the blandish side."}
{"text":"If only the service was as good as the food then this place could be 5 stars! The Mexican French toast paired with a spicy Bloody Mary hit the spot. Now if only we were able to get our water or drinks refilled. Didn't have the best service last time we are here either. Too bad!"}
{"text":"I have flown numerous times and never, once at an airport have I been kicked out of a place because I wasn't eating their food. I've been at the airport for almost 9 hours due to airplane problems. Ate at this place this morning. There are no community tables or an area to really eat except in the benches by the terminals. The lady was rude. Kicked out flight attendants on a lay over as well. Just rude. Ps the food wasn't all that great. Ended up throwing out half of my burrito that was 9$  waste of money"}
{"text":"We were so good, and got to the airport really early, so we had some time to kill.  This is just the place to do it.  (Hot tip:  be seated in the tequila tasting room, it is very quiet and intimate. You would never have thought you were in an airport.   We shared the Arizona burrito: pork chile verde in a burrito, topped with tomatillo salsa, and cheese, with two over easy eggs.  It was delicious and we ate every last bite.  The Bloody Mary was very good and the service was excellent.  So, if you are ever held over at PHX, this is a pretty cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Nothing boxed or packaged, I know because I inquired, I'm a health food junkie.  (This seemed to be the healthiest spot in my terminal). I got the fish tacos with a salad. The salad was super good quality and the balsamic dressing was GOOOOD! My reason for only 4 stars is the fish portions were VERY small. But I know it's a business and they need to profit. But a tad bigger pieces would have been better. Also, the staff was professional and friendly."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise for airport food, yes its pricey but at least its worth it.  They have killer french press coffee, they bring you a big carafe for 2 that makes at least 5-6 cups.  I ordered the chilaquiles which were tasty and my husband had the Mexican omelet.  The service was really good too, since we were in a time crunch they served us pretty quick.  If in the area again I would definitely come back and try the cochinita pibil witch is supposed to be the house specialty."}
{"text":"Terminal 4 gate D. Table service and service is SLOW. If you are in a hurry, go somewhere else. We would have gone to La Grande Orange but they don't have enough seating. Barrio has Limited vegetarian options and no vegan options. They do not even have beans. My husband ordered fish tacos and said they were bland. I ordered the torta Barrio and although the bread was good it was just ok overall, and they left the seeds in the Chile which I don't like."}
{"text":"There's two things wrong with this place.  1. The bar stools are huge and have no backs.  Why is this a problem?  I have nowhere to hang my carry on/backpack and the size of the stools leaves less people at the bar...dumb.  2. Very few outlets to charge electronics while having a drink...very dumb.   One would think the designer would have thought of something that simple.  Didn't bother having a drink(s) because of it.  Charging my phone was more important than paying $8 for a $3 beer."}
{"text":"Definitely airport food! Don't ever order to share cuz they will charge a dollar fifty for a second sleep whether you use it or not. The Bloody Mary was really spicy and thick the food was okay but then again airport food. And $30 for one drink and one meal to share course!"}
{"text":"Liked it here with great service and good food.  Then I saw the bartender grab six dirty glasses with his bare hands, put them aside in a sink, never washed his hands and grabbed new glasses and filled them with beer and other alcohol!!  Dirty dirty dirty!!  Glad I didn't order any alcohol from there!"}
{"text":"Plenty of room for an airport restaurant. Food is good and prices are not to bad. Located on the D concourse in terminal 4."}
{"text":"The airport can be such a drag. All the hot bodies, angry travelers and yelling children can be quite a buzz kill. We needed a pick me up before heading home. Popped into Barrio for drinks. We were seated in the middle at a small barish table. It was so hot and loud. We saw the exterior bar open up and asked to move. No problem. Ahhhh we were already feeling better.  We had a great waitress who took cars of us the whole time. We started with a bloody Maria for me and a margarita for Derek. Followed with a 16 oz beer and what do you know, you can add a shot of Jameson on for $4. Yes please. Great break in between flights."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar while waiting during my layover between flights.  It was cool to see the bartenders have some rapport with some of the passing customers.  It gave it a \"divey/neighbourhood\" feel.    I had the fish tacos which were OK.  The fries that came with it kinda sucked.  They were pretty stale.  The ketchup was pretty good, it had spicy kick to it.  At $15 for three tacos however it's a bit over priced even for airport food.  Sitting at the bar you're able to witness some stuff.  I should've followed my instincts and just pushed my tacos away.  Hygiene wasn't great with the staff.  One bartender got choked up and started coughing...immediately proceeded to make drinks with out washing his hands.  Another came by to pick up some cut limes clearing her throat over them, they were unwrapped. This is after I received my meal and got given silverware that looked a little dingy.  To make matters worst...a 1/4 way through my flight my stomach did not feel so good.  Luckily my flight was short and my place is near the airport, otherwise I would had blown up the bathroom (no pun intended)  Overall...stay away from here if you plan on grabbing a quick bite between flights.  It's overpriced and mediocre at best...and food poisoning on a flight is no fun. The star is more for the atmosphere of the bar area.  Bartenders should clean up a bit more though"}
{"text":"Guacamole was interesting with the dried cranberries, it was chunky and tasty but needed salt. The chips were horrible! Whoever provides their chips should be fired, those are not chips.  They were too thick and stale. Gross. I tried to enjoy the guacamole, but the chips absolutely ruined it.  Service was pretty good until it got busy. I would stop for a drink, but not being able to enjoy guacamole and chips at a mexican food restaurant is tragic."}
{"text":"Average at best. The marinade on the steak was good but otherwise the tacos were just like you'd get anywhere.   A lot of flights are delayed so service wasn't stellar, I sat for an hour after my meal had been taken away. I was never asked if I wanted anything else, and had to flag my server down for the check eventually.   I wouldn't recommend it, but it wasn't terrible. Definitely overpriced"}
{"text":"Yeah.... I'm going to go ahead and rubber stamp all of the bad reviews on here. The house margarita was way too sour. Barely drinkable and tiny for $10. I ordered a side salad with my tacos which came barely dressed at all and had no flavor. The tacos I order were ok, but left me wanting more. I literally left here and went to another terminal with more options to get a second drinks and appetizer before my flight."}
{"text":"For a regular restaurant this this is very good. For an airport location it is great. Great service good prices. Kuali camaron awesome pork tacos good. Fries ok."}
{"text":"I assume this place is owned by the same people who own the 16th street location but if it is, OMG what are you doing polluting your brand?  Stopped there the other night before a flight and was excited because I like the orginal.  No ambience and I had this waitress who looked and acted miserable.  She also made me feel rushed.  So, she pushes the special tequila margarita and i get one.  Just okay.  Then I ask if you can mix and match tacos.. don't want four of the same taco.  No.  Then I order a  chile plate and it was so cold and gross it was inedible.  I sent it back and asked for guamamole and chips which was actually quite good.  Although when the waitress was preparing it tableside she seemed bored and irritated.   To her credit she didn't charge me for the chile.  Real disappointment... go next door to the Grande Orange cafe."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible service. We waited 15 minutes for the overwhelmed server to show up and she was a little grumpy.  Requested a bottle of wine and were told that the bottle we wanted was out of stock, so the server offered a recommendation. Turns out the recommendation was also out of stock as was our 3rd choice. Ordered the table side guacamole and (1) it was not table side (2) the chips were stale. The server let us know that all of there chips were stale so we made do. The guacamole itself was great. The main course  took too long to come out but was wonderful when it did arrive. I had the pork my wife had a shrimp appetizer.  Overall it took longer than an hour and 15 minutes; way too long for an airport."}
{"text":"Warning, don't go to this place if you're looking for good authentic Mexican food. This place is terrible. I was happy when I got seated right away but only to find out why. Food taste like it's from a can bought from a low end grocery store. They don't serve complimentary chips. It will cost you at least $9 and they are pretty bad. I ordered posole and it tasted like something out of a can. Maybe my expectation is higher than average but I don't think so.  The only good thing are the people serving. They are professional and nice. The cook and management should be fired. Terrible terrible terrible!  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit overpriced even for being an airport restaurant. Their guacamole is huge which is good if you are sharing with others however I was alone and requested a half size but my request could not be met. It is made table side which I think is unnecessary and they didn't even wear gloves which was kind of a let down."}
{"text":"I stop here when ever I fly thru PHX if I have the time. I get the Americano with , sometimes coffee sometimes taquila yummy"}
{"text":"I had a rather long layover at the airport and was searching for something light and filling to eat.  All of the salads at the neighboring restaurant were pre-made and covered in cheese, which I personally do not like.  Of all of the available choices I thought that Barrio Cafe was a decent option.    I ordered the fish tacos and a side salad.  The food was pretty good, however they could have gone a lot lighter on the breading of the fish or offered a grilled option.  The flavor of the food was really good and so was the service.  I would consider going back if I was in that terminal again."}
{"text":"First of all we LOVE barrio cafe and barrio queen in Phoenix and Scottsdale. If we had to pick a last meal it would be their guacamole, pork tacos and posole. This is why we were soooooo excited to see barrio at the airport. Very sadly it did not measure up at all :( The posole soup did not have hominy and radishes like at the other restaurants, it seriously seemed like they just threw pork in some broth. We also ordered the pork tacos and all of the pork was very fatty, I couldn't even eat it. I know this is not like the other restaurants at all, something is very off here!"}
{"text":"So overpriced its unreal. My boyfriend and I wanted a snack before our flight so we asked for chips and salsa, the waiter said \"its $10 for a tiny bowl of them\" .. no thank you. So we split an order of steak tacos - which were 3 for $14.. no rice or beans or anything, just 3 street tacos. That's almost $5 a taco, insane. So for 2 bud lights, a 9oz glass of wine ($18) and one order of tacos (3) our bill was $45. Crazy!"}
{"text":"I travel about 80% for work. Anyone that says this is the best airport food ever clearly do not travel often. The food is gross and overpriced and the service is terrible. My trip and meals are company funded so cost is not the issue for me -- it's all about food and service quality.   Too bad Sky Harbor management isn't reading the reviews - maybe it would improve. Clearly Barrio's is ignoring them. I am so disappointed that they removed all of the other restaurants from D Gates.  If you have time I recommend you walk over to C Gates....There's a small Paradise Bakery, Cinnabon, and (if you must) a Burger King."}
{"text":"I liked my food, Waiter made great recommendations. Excellent service."}
{"text":"It was fairly good at first but my plate came with a lot of grease on it and after consuming half of my plate all that was left to taste was a overwhelming grease flavor. Also, the French press coffee (although it looks quite good) is not worth the $4 a cup.  There was a great amount of variety here though which was great to find and it was so close to my gate!"}
{"text":"Nachos only... I was very hungry when my delayed flight finally landed but really, some of the better nachos I've had.  The chips were fresh corn tortilla chips and the fresh avocado really finished off this interesting dish nicely.  Why was it interesting? The \"nachos\" weren't greasy at all, they were topped with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, onions and jalapenos, all sprinkled with a little bit of bleu cheese and a little bit of chorizo! The grilled chicken was almost non-existent but I didn't care because the veggies were so good.  Yes, I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised how good they were!  There was also sour cream and classic salsa on the side but you really didn't need the sour cream.  Even if you're a purist, try them if you're feeling adventurous, they are worth it. Great, quick service too - nice if you're connecting flight doesn't give you much time to eat something."}
{"text":"Service was fine. Boyfriend got the fish tacos which were decent but overpriced. The restaurant could benefit from some vegetarian or vegan options. The best they could offer me was chips and salsa for $9. I was surprised that a Mexican restaurant didn't have some rice and beans and moreover that it does not cater whatsoever to plant-based eating."}
{"text":"I really wanted a restaurant feel when I landed in the airport. I had a two hour layover so I wanted to make sure I got a good meal. Barrio Café fit what I was craving so I decided to go.  Our waitress was incredibly nice. The food was a bit slow getting out. I got the burrito (I forget what this one was called) and while it was good, I wanted something more from it. It didn't have anything exciting or different for me to mention. And I know it's airport food, but I was excited to eat in Arizona because I've heard so much about the food. I chose barrio fries on the side. There really isn't anything special about them. They are fries with spicy seasoning on top. For airport food, this is a great place. A little pricey but still decent."}
{"text":"As far as barrio cafes go I hope this isn't your first experience because the original is amazing but we are in an airport and when you live in airports like I do it's refreshing to see local restaurants representing inside the terminals.  I say restaurants because Le grand orange is right next door where..... PS. you can get a glass of wine for half of what I'm paying here in the barrio.   The food at barrio is always spectacular if your looking for a 16 dollar shrimp quesadilla but if your looking for complimentary chips and salsa and a glass of wine.... pass. Because the 9 dollar chips and salsa  they serve is... sorry to be rude not worth it and in my Phoenician opinion are not what should be served in any PHX Mexican restaurant ever! and the message the chef is sending comes through loud and clear. Don't come here unless you wanna spend money and trust my recipes. But I will because then again I am stuck inside terminal four and spent 30 bucks on wine and pizza last time so at lease its something different and the service is always phenomenal."}
{"text":"This is surprisingly inspired and delicious food in an airport. The restaurant is true to its roots and the passion is evident in even the \"simplest\" dishes. The quesadilla borracha and empanizado del mar are great starts; we do the tacos with fish or shrimp every time we travel through. The only downside is the prices, which are to be expected in an airport meal--they're no reflection on the restaurant.  Staff are friendly and food is relatively quick; if you have angst about time, order to-go at the side bar."}
{"text":"Food was just not good! To be fair, it was fresh, but it was a poor combination of flavors. I ordered the grilled chicken tacos. They came drowned, and I mean totally smothered, in goat cheese and some type of cream sauce. It was literally dripping when I tried to eat it. The salad had a very light dressing, but was unremarkable. The service was bad. I felt ignored because I was seated way in the back away from everyone when there were tables available elsewhere. Took my server 10 minutes to greet me, and he seemed shocked when I told Jim I was ready to order. Once my food came he never checked on me again. I placed my credit card on he table when I was finished to give them a hint I was ready to go. This just reinforced my belief that you can't get decent Mexican food outside of California. Sorry PHX! Still love ya tho..."}
{"text":"Came in again.  I know a gluten for punishment.  However today I had a much different experience.  My servers name was Reeni, and she was great.  I had the chips and guacamole which were good.  I then had the posole and it was out of this world.  Reeni thank you for taking the time explaining the restaurant as well as the food.  I will return."}
{"text":"Very good fish tacos, and the salad was tiny but delicious. My daughter had a quesadilla with barrio fries. With limited options in the airport - this place was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Place is packed (Gate D @ PHX) -granted, it's day before Thanksgiving. Having the Burrito Arizona - nicely done. Moist pork and tomatillo sauce w a sprinkle of Oaxaca cheese. Dee-vinnne!!!    Love the Barrio fries w/ house ketchup (spicy)!"}
{"text":"Had a long layover flying into Phoenix. Server was great with kids and the food had some flavor. Only critique is the menu is a-little complicated to read through. Also, they do not serve chips and salsa"}
{"text":"Yes, I am the traveler who seeks - even during airport layovers - to maximize the culinary adventure. Because I don't know who doesn't need a fresh meal and a stiff drink while slogging across almost the entire nation in nine hours....  Things one needs, then: a fresh meal. I know airport-fresh should be flitting around here in air quotes, but it helps in that case to avoid any of the million ready-to-eat burrito joints in favor of somewhere you actually sit down and order from a menu. A good sign of such a place is guacamole mashed and made tableside: no sleight-of-packaging there. Another good sign of such a place is an external presence elsewhere in the relevant city; reputation matters a bit, insofar as it sets up comparison, expectation, and perhaps a bit of consistency.   And then there's the stiff drink. My flying preference is a margarita: a little salt to help you retain water and avoid dehydration, a little sour to wake up your tired mouth, and a little citrus to freshen your mind. And the only acceptable sign in an airport for one of these is that you're ordering it within the confines of a Mexican restaurant (by which I don't mean Chili's Too).  Barrio Cafe it was: a pretty good choice if you have a bit of time to kill, and similar standards for how to best slay it. While much of the menu is too pricey for an airport terminal (it'll be a cold day in Arizona when I'll pay $22 for an airport meal of anything), there are tacos, tortas, salads, and soups like posole for much cheaper. Plus the tableside guacamole, which looked lovely and which you can slightly customize to your preferences. I went for one of the tortas with avocado, cotija and queso fresco, all spread over a huge split-and-splayed poblano pepper. This isn't a buttery melty torta, but it was nevertheless so big I had to take the face off and eat it with knife and fork. Americanized? Yep, but good, with plenty of nice rolling heat from the poblano in every bite.  And the margarita was perfect. Seriously, that alone is worth a visit even if you're not hungry; it was all I wanted in a little salty, lime-y glass, and was better than many a margarita I've had at Mexican restaurants nowhere near an airport terminal. I only had the basic version, but if you're feeling a little spendier they had several variations that looked quite tempting.  Very friendly service too; I was impressed by how knowledgeable my server (Brianna, I think) was when suggesting wine to other customers. I noticed because, let's face it, wine pairings in an airport aren't usually a top priority, but she was informed, attentive, and patient. And to top it all off, the music in here was Gipsy Kings: a nice change-of-pace and something that added just a touch of perceived sophistication to my meal.  Phoenix SkyHarbor, you're off my misery list. Now let's just get some signage in the airport so people can find Barrio Cafe without having noted the location the night before...."}
{"text":"I frequent the airport for business & look forward to eating here as I have not had one bad experience!  There chiliquile's is amazing as well as pork burrito with eggs.  I highly recommend this place to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"Review is based purely on service.  The food is good, not great - some items better than others.  Guacamole is the best thing on their menu in my opinion.  I often eat a late lunch here before I fly out, but each time I'm there the service is a bit slower, the hostess a bit more snippy.  Today was the last time I go here.  Many tables open, but hostess insisted on putting me in back of restaurant next to another table against wall.  When I asked if I could sit elsewhere so I didn't have people up on me, she said they need all the other tables for other people.  Maybe 10 tables open, and you need them all?  I said never mind, I'll eat elsewhere.  I don't do rude well, and rude and ignorant is really not good.  FYI - if you do want to try, the airport location is actually better than the one in the city!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. $19 for a salad, its highway robbery! I do not recommend this based on pricing. NO Airport employee discount either.   There are other vendors with more reasonable pricing within walking distance in the terminal."}
{"text":"Grabbed an glass of wine. The bar stools are comfortable the liquor selection looks ok. The bar is located in the southwest terminal."}
{"text":"Just left! Server took 10 minutes to greet the table. She couldn't even smile. We ordered 2 coronas and waters all around. No waters got delivered. She dropped off the food not even asking if we needed anything else. We ate, the food was good. Christin didn't check back in. At the end I had my card out to pay waiting. Overall she made the experience shitty."}
{"text":"I got sucked in by the idea of pancakes and mimosas, but I have no interested in paying $14 for a mimosa that I'm sure would have a light pour. I opted for coffee, which was sour and see-through but it got the job done.  The pancakes and bacon were actually very tasty, and I received 6 pieces of bacon with it plus fresh and hot maple syrup. I couldn't finish the plate and found it to be pretty tasty. However, $17 for pancakes and coffee is outrageous. I recommend any other place in the airport. In addition to the typical outrageous airport pricing, the service was mediocre. I don't need a bright, beaming ray of sunshine. I just need polite service without mistakes. Asking for a coffee refill seemed to ruin this waiter's day."}
{"text":"Nachos no more...unless they are from the Barrio Cafe! Great spin on the makeover of the nacho plate. Very tasty! Will come back just for that!"}
{"text":"Three stars is about right.  This location was not too far from our gate in Terminal 4.  We had a bite to eat here yesterday before our flight home.  Alan had the tacos de camarones w/ water to drink.  I had iced tea and a fruit plate because I wasn't that hungry.  The iced tea was fresh brewed and good.  The fruit plate was OK.  The strawberries were fairly good, the pineapple was very good and the honeydew was hard and tasteless.  The apple slices were too sweet for me, but fine for Alan and the cantaloupe went to him too.  He reported the tacos were fine.  Prices were high, as you would expect in an airport.  Service was very nice."}
{"text":"I had yogurt and fruit for breakfast and there was so much yogurt I had to have a to go box for the fruit.  Janell was the waitress with a personality that was great.  They were very busy but she had time for everyone."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken enchiladas.   Over cooked chicken in a tortilla with gravy.  They added a side of something unidentifiable.  Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Just had a quick breakfast here. Was hoping for some regular coffee, but it's a French press which was fine but I prefer just a regular cup of coffee. Nothing too fancy. Lol. Mimosas are pricey but nothing out of the ordinary at an airport. I took away two stars because they stop serving breakfast at 10a and we were craving breakfast. However, they still served pancakes and it was delicious just like the server said it would. (: overall cute place to sit down and eat/drink."}
{"text":"Always good food here.....great to get in and out of waiting on a flight. Have never had a bad meal and the service has been really qick"}
{"text":"This is an airport bar with all the airport bar amenities. That means $10 draft beers and the oh-so-airport add of a mid-shelf shot for \"only\" $5. What. A. Deal. On the plus, the bartender was pleasant in the way bartenders are pleasant when they know beyond the shadow of a doubt there is a 0% chance you're a regular. Also, it's there. And it's the only place in that gate where you can get a drink. Beggars can't be choosers. Tip well and enjoy your nap on the plane."}
{"text":"If you've ever dined at one of Chef Silvana's creations and are expecting the same experience here, keep walking. To be fair, I do not believe Chef is associated with this place other than the naming royalties.  The service is hurried and the efficient wait staff are obviously anxious to flip tables. \"No, I'm not finished with my guacamole\" as we stare at a half dozen chips and a fair amount of guac. It is an airport eatery after all. The food is better than most Mexican themed airport restaurants but as stated before, it ain't THE Barrio Cafè."}
{"text":"Ordered a cocktail & asked to change tv channel from basketball game not one person was watching. Manager said they'd \"look into it.\" 20 minutes later still no change. Server asks if I want another. If you change channel, sure. No change! Now more ppl asking to change channel to oscars. Servers were nice but \"manager behind the curtain denied request.\" So weird."}
{"text":"We were at the airport and hungry!!! We were in Terminal D so stopped in here to watch the Astros play the Yankees.  We were seated promptly. The tables are pretty small which makes sense as you want more people in an area, but with everyone hauling their carry on luggage it can get fun trying to walk in the aisles. Be careful folks.  Each table had a device where you can press one of three buttons to get your waiter's attention, get the check and there was another button I can't remember what it was for. The server wore a wristband that would notify them of the table calling for service. Pretty cool since this place gets busy being at the airport.  We ordered the guacamole Barrio ($12.35). The menu states it is prepared table side. Our guacamole came out in a bowl already prepared. The server had cilantro all over the plates she handed us. The guacamole was good, but needed some salt. Definitely had a spicy kick to it that I appreciated. The salsa that was brought out was very tasty too! The tortilla chips were thick so it was easy to scoop up the guacamole.  The Michelada with Dos XX (asked for it extra spicy) was not bad at all. The server recommended that over the Bloody Maria. Good choice.  Overall, the place is good and of course any time you buy ANYTHING at an airport it will be at a higher price than other places outside the airport. The food wasn't bad at all.  Good place to hang out at and watch the game. Must check out the murals in here. Pretty cool."}
{"text":"Was surprised how good this place was, and at the airport in Terminal D no less.    A bit pricey mind you but it is the airport after all.     Food was really good.   I had the Arizona Burrito and probably the freshest burrito I've had in a long time.   Great mix of ingredients.   Now let's talk service.   You know by my other reviews, service can make or break a place.   Well, the service here was phenomenal.  Our waitress Alexandra was superb.   Great to find a good waitress and we tipped accordingly.   Also, I must comment on the management to, as they were actively  present and engaged with the staff and customers.   Really nice to see leadership in action.    Try this place.   Well worth it."}
{"text":"Dammit I was in the mood for their \"famous carne asada fries\" first of all, dogs eat better. The meat tasted rubbery and chewy. The fries were soggy. Very pricey but it is in the Airport. However how can you label something the special when it taste like yesterday's garbage. I had to get tums to relive the pain of gas and upset stomach. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great experience until Terry came over yelling at me and my party, accusing us of smuggling wine out, but we were still at the table. I was like we don't have to sneak wine. We can buy more in the plane. Lol."}
{"text":"Once I clicked on this restaurant, I was hoping, from seeing the low reviews, I clicked the wrong location.  No, this is the correct spot, the one in the airport, and I actually had decent service and good food.  (I ate here around January 2013).    What I had: *cochinita pibil-  meat was flavorful and tender, and large portions.  The sides it came with complimented the meat. *guac- what a nice, surprising twist adding pomegranate seeds to guac.  Nice how you can add items to the guac (like onions, cilantro, tomatoes, etc) and it is made fresh to order at the table.  I thought this place is the best airport food I have had.  No complaints yet!  I hope to return during my next trip to AZ."}
{"text":"Very expensive  Customer comes 1st , NOT HERE  Upset if you don't order a 12 appetizer  Nothing on menu is below 12 $ You are trapped at D gates for a drink or something to eat ! That's the main reason why they are in business still."}
{"text":"On a layover between flights, we decided to have Breakfast at this location basically because it was next to the gate. I ordered the Arizona burrito ($13) and it was delicious . Also enjoyed some delicious Fresh orange juice.  Service was fast and the restaurant clean. Btw the restrooms are just outside the restaurant entrance. If you have time between flights, this is a good place to grab a meal. Only complaint...not exclusive to this restaurant....why do you seat customers on top of each other when the restaurant is about 20% full? When we were initially being seated, the hostess proceeded to take us to a table right next to another couple, a two top right next to them.  We asked if we could have a another table so that we would give them and us  privacy considering the restaurant was not full.   Then the hostess proceeded to seat a gentleman right next to us, literally an arms length away...when there was clearly 10 to 20 tables she could've been seated him at... So, we got to listen to him talk on the cell phone while we ate breakfast and he got to listen to us talk...Just asking for some commonsense and thoughtfulness please."}
{"text":"Food is good!  I got the nachos which were great and a Bloody Mary which was made with tequila (and was great!)  A little pricey but large portion so not dinging their score.   If you have time to kill at the airport visit this place"}
{"text":"The people behind the bar were polite. The hostess was rude. Lady I don't want a burrito with cheese I'm allergic. It's 6AM and there is 6 customers here. How hard is it to make a burrito without cheese lol. The people behind the bar had great service and realized how easy it is to make a burrito without cheese lol. The hostess maybe \"Andrea\" couldn't grasp the concept."}
{"text":"Of course I was looking at distance from my gate, and chose Barrio Cafe. I love Mexican food and was hoping this would be a good choice in D gates.  The host is very friendly and cordial.  I ordered Tacos de Pollo Poblano with a side salad.  The tacos looked like vomit topped with goat cheese. Less than pleasing. And, if I had known the 'soft' corn tortillas would come basically raw and plenty hard, I would have had airplane peanuts for lunch.  The saving grace was the side salad. Great flavors.  Was it worth the $15 price tag? No. Next time, I'll walk down to A gates and eat at Blanco's Tacos & Tequila."}
{"text":"The 2 scariest food words for me? \"Airport food\". (actually \"goat cheese\" but play along). this palce is legit, though. and very reaonably priced for an airport place. try the chili verde burrito."}
{"text":"I was served water with a bug in it, and after bringing it to the attention of the manager, they still did not offer to comp my breakfast. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Don't expect good or friendly service. They seem very put out by your very existence in their restaurant/bar.   I had a hard time getting service let alone paying my bill to try to get to my plane on time.   They do have a good tequila selection if that's your thing. Which is mine. I would've gladly spent more money on tequila if they'd have bothered to check in with me."}
{"text":"a bit upscaley,   but the chef certainly made me a fan..  although i wont expect this to happen again... i was looking for \" regulalr joe\" mexican food... not taco bell exactly,  but at least ground beef on something...   the chef created , for my benefit   \"regular joe\"  mexican food  for me... so i was happy.   i need more of a regio's  on indian school rd or caroline's mexican food on 16th.  but sa la vie!   the cafe had great seating  and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Fair food and over priced. For them just getting named one of the top Mexican restaurants in the country disappoints."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant surprise for airport food.  This is real food, a bit pricey but it's in an airport.  It's a lively place with colorful artwork on the walls and bright overstuffed banquettes along the walls.  There's a busy bar area too.  We didn't have much time so we ordered quick and asked for rush on the food and they accommodated us without complaint.  I had the cochinta pibil torta which was very tasty, orange scented slow cooked pork, pickled red onion, Mexican cheese, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole on crusty bread.  Yummy.  My son had the steak Ricardo - a perfectly cooked steak served with a bunch of Mexican accoutrements over fries.  Also very tasty.  This is a nice choice if you've got some time at Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Ok for airport food. There was only a partial menu so no basics. But it was ok. The problem is at this airport there are some great food choices so that makes this 3 stars."}
{"text":"Solid airport option - lunch on a Friday in terminal 4, by D gates. Went for the house pork tacos w fries- filling food! Good stuff, esp for an airport. Service was a bit slow but very friendly staff and great music- soak it up for a while!"}
{"text":"Waited to be seated for 7 mins. I then sat myself down since the staff was busy watching the soccer game on tv. Waitress then got mad at me. I left. Rude people"}
{"text":"Traveling out of Phoenix?   Barrio Cafe is a must stop if you're departing from the D gates. And if you're not, it's worth the hike if your time permits.   I adore their location(s) in the Valley and the airport is no exception.   Although will admit - I haven't indulged in much of the menu here (a lot of complaints noted and the quality of service) beyond their chips and salsa ($9) which seem true to form.   Just the right amount of spice and flavor in it to make the locals happy, but not enough to scare off the Snowbirds and \"Aliens from Minnesota\".   Order these with the infamous Low Rider Margarita ($14.25). With a generous pour of Don Julio Silver, surely you'll be feeling like you're walking on air before your flight.   Heading out to Puerto Rico this morning, hubs Andrew C. helped himself to one. Me? Well, tequila and I aren't the best of friends at 40,000 feet so ordered a Double Screwdriver ($12) with their fresh squeezed daily orange juice. Perfect.   Friendly and efficient service which was a pleasant surprise  (this is a holiday travel weekend at the time of review).   Sit at the bar and say hello to Ken and Terry.   Enjoy your flight!"}
{"text":"As I sit here at the barrio cafe I must say I'm really disappointed. The staff rushed me into a decision and didn't really answer some of the questions I had about the menu. The food is way over priced. I got the roasted pork plate because when I asked any questions about anything else the server just told me it was the best (its also the priciest of the options I was looking at).  I originally wanted wine, but they were out of about half the options and I wasn't about to pay $15 for a glass of Mexican merlot.... My $12 blended margarita was semi runny but also hard to consume due to chunks of ice in it... I mean come on if you're going to over charge me at least give me something decent.  My meal arrived about 120 seconds after I ordered it... I think I just paid $40 for fast food (that zucchini could not have possibly been cooked fresh...)  Since I have been sitting here I have noticed rude staff (not necessarily to me but to others around me!) one of the gimmicks of this place I guess is that they make guac table side.... I straight up saw the host and a server get into an argument while the server was making the guac for a table next to me.  No one smiles. No one accommodates. And my corn tortillas stuck together and ripped apart :( :( :( very sad I wasted my money here."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool and it was my first time there...surprisingly at the airport location rather than down the street at the actual location. The bartenders were nice. We had some great drinks and the food looked amazing. I would love to check out the actual location but the Phoenix airport is pretty awesome now that it has all the local restaurants in there."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast only.  Had a breakfast burrito with chicken. It simply tasted terrible. I can't say it was the recipe or food itself or maybe it just wasn't my thing but it was terrible none the less. Coffee was extremely bitter and topped off the expensive lesson. It's the airport so maybe I should just accept that it will be sub par."}
{"text":"Airport food has a much earned reputation.  I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, drink and service here.   Yes, sticker shock at looking at the menu (and the resulting tab). I had a margarita and it was served in a tall glass. I have to admit I was expecting more juice than Tequila - what a surprise!  I could taste the tequila in a well balanced margarita. They did well by my husbands gin martini too.   I ordered the pork tacos and my husband had the chicken tacos. Yes. They were spicy. If you like heat - they were delicious!  The pork was their special slow roasted pork and very tasty. The chicken tacos had a delicious cream sauce. We chose the house salad.  The salad was made from salad greens and topped with onions, tomatoes and crumble cheese. The salad was lightly dressed with balsamic vinaigrette. Presentation was excellent.   All in all, almost worth the price - 4 stars for great food - minus one star for pricing."}
{"text":"Must try the guacamole...and their pulled pork dishes are phenomenal!! I have yet to eat anything bad from here. Very authentic and very good. They make the guacamole fresh right in front of you."}
{"text":"This is a nice option with tasty alternatives to your traditional airport food but it is overpriced and service was slow. $16.50 got me half of an avocado on a small bed of greens with 4 small shrimp. Plus the menu said it was $15. It was tasty and a nice light meal for traveling. Service was slow which normally isn't a good thing for travel but we had 4 hours to kill. I had to ask for dressing twice, my husband got the wrong side, and we asked for something we never ended up receiving. If you have a few extra bucks in your travel budget and time for a sit down meal, this is a good option."}
{"text":"Tries too hard. Bad service especially when even slightly crowded. Plating of food is like throwing random stuff on plates. Rude servers. Food not great."}
{"text":"As I wandered around the airport trying to find a seat to watch the US v Belgium game, I finally stumbled across the Barrio Cafe. I was so happy to be seated at a bar and watching the game that they could have served dogfood and I would have been OK. Rest assured they did not serve dogfood. This wasn't as salty. I am kidding of course but the food was not memorable. Ordered the Torta Cochinita Pibil. It was a big sandwich of pork marinated in achiote and sour orange. That sounds great but it was rather bland. It was topped with pickled onion and pico de gallo. Those were nice but the strong flavor of the torta bread overpowered. The fries were decent and I enjoyed the spicy chipotle ketchup. Ultimately, the pork was underwhelming and a torta cannot recover if the star fails."}
{"text":"NOT your standard airport restaurant fare!  Try the chicken poblano enchilada.  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Since I'm going to New Orleans and probably won't eat any Mexican food, figured I need to have something before I take off.   This place is Term D and well decorated. I rally like the theme and paintings.   Service-very slow moving, everyone around me had to ask several times to drinks, check, or other. Maybe more staff.....  Food-opted for Posole Verde because I was looking for something not so heavy and warm. This hit hit the spot, prefer when you get to add the sides, but this place served them already mixed in.   Couple notes on prices:  Chips & Salsa-$9 Chips & Guac-$16( if not more)   Over priced in my opinion, but I'm sure airport space isn't cheap."}
{"text":"The burrito is full of chicken but that is where it ends. there is minimal flavor and the food is overpriced, what do you expect in an airport. On a positive note the service was decent."}
{"text":"Good for drinks but not much else... Margaritas \"blended\" were an icy/watery mess and the table side made guacamole featured full leaves of cilantro and chunks of jalapeño - could use a smaller chop there. Just grab drinks at the bar and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"If you're ever at the airport stop in and try it ALL!!! Just as awesome as the actual restaurant. We live in California and go to Arizona just to eat at the restaurants!"}
{"text":"Been twice, good service.  Food is ok, not great not bad.  Has four peaks peach on tap so I'll be back.  Standard airport pricing."}
{"text":"The best part of this place was the beer. Guess it's hard to mess up pulling a tap handle.  The beer was slightly overpriced but still ok for an airport.  We ordered the \"table side\" guacamole.  Not made table side which I didn't care but don't advertise that on the menu.  The chips were so hard they were almost not edible.   Probably the worst part of this place was the service.  From the time the hostess sat us we felt like the server didn't want us to be there.  $35 for two beers subpar guac and horrible service not even worth it at an airport.  There is a cafe next door that is the better option."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 3 star only because of the price and quality of the food. To their credit, the place is clean, appears to run pretty efficiently, and the staff is polite and prompt. But $13 for that little margarita? I dunno. I ordered the Nachos as an \"appetizer but could I have it as a meal, please? yes, with chicken\" but I had to dig around for the little pieces of chicken it came with. Fortunately, I'm not much of a meat eater so it made little difference to me. But, for $17, when I want chicken, I want more that 2 oz. scattered in little pieces throughout.   The sidebar guac looked entertaining although we did not partake. There's also televisions so you can watch the latest game before catching your flight. However, the way overpriced food and lack of substance is what brought this review down."}
{"text":"Pork tacos are flavourful and horrible at the same time. The consistency of the tortilla is almost like stale bread. The meat and other dressings have good flavor though."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good eatery for an airport.  The place was packed and servers running about madly attending to hungry flyers.  My server eyed me from across the bar, reading my impatience and immediately came over.  I had the carnitas torta (Mexican sandwich on a hard roll). with fries.  The pork was tender, super juicy, and bursting with flavor.  The bun was good but could have been a bit crunchier.  Fries were fresh and tasty, accompanied by spicy ketchup.  The Cadillac margarita was excellent.  Take this out of the airport and it would be a winner.  All in all, a good experience."}
{"text":"This might be crazy but anytime I take southwest and I have to have a layover I always make it in phx. Why because of this place here. BEST UNTRADITIONAL NACHOS EVER! Scale of 1-10 these nachos are a 20 ! I eat a whole order to myself every time! A little pricy but I honestly don't care worth every penny and the layover I just wish we had them out here in Seattle ! Can't wait till my next layover lol"}
{"text":"What a treat during my layover in Pheonix! As I walked by, I smelled deliciousness, so I couldn't pass up an opportunity to try Barrio Cafe. I got the steak tacos upon suggestion and I was not disappointed! Flavorful marinated steak with large chunks of avocado on corn tortillas. AMAZING. The side salad that comes with it was great as well.   Hope I get 'layovered' in Pheonix again in the future so that I can try their Arizona Burrito, green chili pork, and shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"Most disappointing breakfast burrito I've had in my life. Bland and obviously just thrown together. Cost over $10. Lady was nice."}
{"text":"There was an Instagram photo of their Phoenix sign located at their parking lot. Since we only had three hours in Phoenix that we decided to eat lunch at Barrio Cafe.   There was a homeless guy in a wheelchair waiting outside and when I went inside one of the server came out and gave him a gallon of water. That was really nice to see as it was really hot outside.   We were greeted and seated immediately. The staff were really friendly.   The place is very artsy and there were art works from Pablo Luna. You can buy some of his artworks as there were prices.   We were really hungry and the food we ate definitely hit the spot! We live in San Francisco and usually prefer eating authentic Mexican foods in the Mission district. It was really good and reminded me of the tacos I ate when I was in Tijuana.   Overall, I recommend this place and would love to visit again once I come back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Plenty of outlets for travelers that are in need of some power- both at the bar and in the booths. Extremely fast service and food delivery (a plus for quick layovers) - but they're not quick to make you leave if you've got time to kill, either. I ordered the chicken tacos (tacos come in corn tortilla- burritos are larger in a flour tortilla) - seriously delicious. Keep in mind I'm a goat cheese fanatic - so that played into this crazy happy review.  I will definitely make this a regular stop for upcoming PHX layovers!"}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant this place is decent. I got tacos and nachos. I can't even describe the nachos. They looked like a plate with chips and every ingredient you can think of thrown on top of them. Very bland, and the sauce was gross, runny, and tasteless too.  The tacos, however, were really good- fried shrimp. Hit the spot.  Also had a couple margaritas which tasted mostly like margarita mix. Basically the tacos were this places saving grace. If you're craving tacos before you leave or your flight is delayed I would get yours here."}
{"text":"I was referred here after being told the restaurants in the Phoenix airport were great. Our experience at this restaurant was not great. The server, Jane,  was fantastic - completely on top of it, and had our order and ticket out quickly as she knew we were in a hurry. But the food was just not good. I chose the special, the Burrito Arizona, which arrived an uninspired lump which tasted like salty pot roast. Nothing special about that. The side salad (I thought it was odd to have a choice of side salad or fries with a burrito, but i went with it) was just old. The leaves were wilted and starting to scum over, and no amount of dressing could hide that. And while the guacamole itself was good, the chips served with it were stale.   We ended up downing our beers and picking at the food. I might have complained had I had more time, but alas, we had a plane to catch.   Good thing Southwest gave me extra snacks once on board."}
{"text":"They would have gotten at least 4 stars, but when I asked for a tea to go the great server told me she couldn't do that. However, she was happy to up sell me a bottle of water.   Service was also at first to be seated and then to have an actual server stop by the table. It was a busy time as loads of flights had been delayed and they were working to close up shop around 9pm.   Once I got a server...everything was great. Table side guacamole was good as were the pork tacos.   I would stop by again if I was on a delayed flight in terminal 4."}
{"text":"Ok we all know airport food is overpriced.   Got it. We aren't judging based on that since your totally at the mercy of whatever they are charging unless you would rather starve waiting for your insanely delayed flight. After waking around for 45 minutes and realizing this was the only open restaurant we thought we were settling. Boy were we wrong! The only thing better than the food was the service. So friendly and welcoming. Great margaritas and incredible Mexican food. This place was a much needed oasis in a desert of airport hell."}
{"text":"The kitchen took shortcuts with our $13 Arizona burritos. They left out the crema mexicana and the Oaxaca cheese. Our 2 burritos only had the pork green chile in a tortilla. Shame on the kitchen for taking advantage of airport customers. If the Barrio cafe had a little more pride, this place could be delicious.   The server did bring us some crema Mexicana & Oaxaca cheese when we complained, but naturally the cheese wasn't melted. We tossed the cold cheese into our burritos.   My fries were decent for airport fries, and came with a spicy ketchup which I enjoyed. Our server was cheerful.   The cafe is in the D terminal and is convenient when flying Southwest. Ask for a table with outlets and you can charge your smart phone for more yelping! Or just eat somewhere better. )-; 0-;"}
{"text":"Worst bloody marys in the airport. Pass on by."}
{"text":"Having breakfast before we head home. Ordered the Americano which was really good. The bacon has a little kick to it.  Sausage looks tasty too. Had reg coffee and lots of it."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand the mediocre rating but I have only eaten here once.  I had poblano chicken soft tacos. They were incredibly flavorful. The spices were very unique and not your standard \"american\" Mexican flavors. In fact, save for a restaurant in San Diego, this has probably been the best tasting Mexican food that I have had in a very long time (I am from the Midwest).  The cost was what you would expect for an airport. The service was fast and knowledgeable, but it was at a slow time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best nachos I've ever had. Hands down. If you are fortunate enough to be in this terminal of PHX...do it."}
{"text":"Margaritas are great but BEWARE, they will charge you $9 for chips and salsa. It's not on the menu and the server didn't mention the extra cost."}
{"text":"Don't do it!!! The worst food ever. I ordered the breakfast burrito and it made me sick. I wish I wouldn't have eaten any of it - esp before flying! Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Except for getting my food order wrong and my drink order wrong, the food was good. I had the pork torta and it was well balanced with a decent roll.  But, can't give more stars with the inattentive server."}
{"text":"The food here was surprisingly delicious!  Very classy place with a unique twist on the dishes I tried. I'm in from out of town on business, busy will be returning when I come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was stuck in the airport after a delay with Southwest Airlines.  Had some time to kill and was a little hungry.  The place looked bright and clean.  I was seated immediately by a nice greeter.  Placed an order for chicken tacos and checked Yelp reviews as I waited for my food.  Got a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews.....several about the chicken tacos!  Before I could even finish reading reviews, my food was out.  3 smallish tacos. Soft fresh tortillas with piping hot chicken.  The cream sauce was delicious.  The salad was nice and cold.  Mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette.  My server Vincent was friendly, polite and efficient. Absolutely worth every penny of the $14!   I'm glad I read the reviews AFTER I ordered or I might have missed out on this place."}
{"text":"Wow! What a pleasant surprise. Great service with call buttons to order or get check quickly. Food was very good, and with unique dishes to choose from, there is terrific variety. Margarita was yummy!! And not overpriced for airport. A great place to relax before your flight."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in the airport.  Fish tacos are fresh and it's a nice change from airport food :) I'll be back."}
{"text":"Very pleased overall with the food and service.  I had the bacon and thick cut bacon and it was delicious!  The coffee is definitely a must have and was impressed with their attention to including the splenda at the beginning to ensure it was well dissolved. Overall a great quick stop for breakfast and I would highly recommend the coffee!"}
{"text":"I guess its not bad for an airport resturant.  The service was so bad.. it took us 10 mins each time to flag down the waitress.  We got shrimp tacos that were pretty good except it only had 1 shrimp in each of them... I'd head over to gate A&B to eat at Four Peaks instead"}
{"text":"If you are starving between flights and only have time to grab from their to-go cooler, don't bother stopping.  No one working the stand and the bartender refused to ring me up.  To the male bartender who was unnecessarily rude--acting like something is not part of your job is never the right response to a customer.  If you don't like being a restaurant employee, that's on you and it's no one else's problem.  Please don't take it out on the people who want to spend money at your establishment."}
{"text":"I had a good salad chicken salad with tomatoes over a bed of spinach. The service was very slow in the beginning - I couldn't find waitstaff anywhere to order. Eventually she showed up and was quite attentive."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! We had a goody-packed chicken salad, burrito, & tacos. Everything was of quality, flavorful, & delicious. Service was crazy fast & attentive. Prices were great. Portions nice."}
{"text":"- The service was friendly and prompt - The guacamole was better than what I had at the downtown location - The posole was much worse than the downtown location  Overall, decent overpriced airport food if you have time."}
{"text":"Airport chow , ordered fish tacos with fries also came with a small salad plus 3 caronas. About 35 bucks. Tasty, great grilled  fish tacos with cabbage and avocado..would have been better but the tortillas just were not as warm as they should have been ..it was slightly above average for airport chow...i would still  recommend trying this dish"}
{"text":"I arrived very early to pick up my daughters, so I went in for a beer.  I had a Negra Modelo, and after a bit, felt hungry.  Their prices are a bit extreme for just a snack, but the fresh-made guacamole sounded delicious, and was reasonably priced.  They prepare it table-side, and the anticipation of watching it being prepared makes it taste better. (True story)  It had large chunks of avocado, jalapenos, onions, tomatoes, cilantro, lemon juice, and is topped with pomegranate seeds.  One of the most amazing guacamoles I've ever had, and I have had, and made dozens of recipes.  I may have to head to the location outside the airport, and try one of their entrees.  If I spend any significant amount of time in the airport again, I'll certainly hit this spot again!"}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food.  Really enjoyed my torta.  Beer taps weren't working when I was there, so that was a bummer."}
{"text":"OK. At least get the food prep right!  While waiting for a Southwest flight (like everybody else here), I ordered the \"Arizona Burrito\" which was on the small size and not adequately heated. This came with either fries or a small salad. I opted for the salad, which was made with mixed greens and chopped tomatoes. The salad was just OK - a little heavy on the dressing. But the biggest problem was that the Arizona Burrito didn't come with any cheese or crema. These were clearly on the burrito's description on the menu! No Oaxaca cheese or crema Mexicana at all. The waitress was nice and brought out some cheese and crema on the side, but it just wasn't the same! Any other restaurant would have had the manager come to the table.   Another big problem has to do with the general atmosphere at this Barrio Cafe. It felt like the workers and waitstaff were not too serious about their jobs. They were pretty casual about everything - too much goofing off. This is clearly a problem with management.   I won't be dining at the Barrio Cafe in the future. My food was just OK, made incorrectly, and way overpriced for what you got."}
{"text":"That was the best Mexican food I've ever had, and that includes travel to Mexico.  We were in a hurry; our fight was boarding in 15 minutes. Rox got us our food within five minutes, and steak tacos coupled with a Goose Island IPA are a great way to start my trip.  Sure, it was pricier than I expected, but it was double the food at 120% the price.   Worth it.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Close to the gates, with plenty of seating and outlets for laptops. We wanted a drink while waiting to board. The waitress was clueless as to the pricing and offerings. It's a tequila bar and I had to ask for the tequila menu. Then when I order a flight, she asked if I wanted it doubled - I asked how much to double the flight - she didn't know. Came back and said $15 to double and I ask, each shot or for the flight?  She was confused. Then realized I ordered a flight and acted like I was the person in the wrong. Weird.   $27 for a flight of good tequila in an airport. Not bad. We had a quiet corner, Mexican coke, and pressed coffee too.   Can't comment on the food but be patient and CLEAR with the waitstaff. You might get the same one."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying this was one of the best meals I have had this year.     I stopped by around 11:30am after running some errands in the area.  I opted for the bar as the ambience was very cool and they had a great selection of tequilas (passes on the tequila this time around, but it was enjoyable to scan everything they have).     I was greeted promptly and also served some complementary bread and tapenade.  I'll admit I have never had this combo before at a Mexican spot, but it was very good.     After looking the at the fantastic menu, I went with the seafood enchiladas.  They came out within 15 minutes.  3 good sized enchiladas with nice portions of crab, shrimp, and small scallops!   The flavors and textures were phenomenal.  There was a mild cheese along with goat cheese inside of the enchiladas - didn't make the dish heavy at all and the goat cheese added a nice tang.  It was also served with a side of veggies which paired great with the cheesy main dish.    Everything was pretty much perfect with regards to this experience.  If you decide to go with this dish, make sure you like goat cheese.  They put a good amount of it in the enchiladas.     Can't wait to head back to try another dish soon!"}
{"text":"Not bad for airport. The AZ style burrito was not nearly as impressive as the description. Not terrible just disappointing. Did not try the margaritas."}
{"text":"Some of the best food ever served in an airport.  The enchiladas, which are tightly rolled in crusty tortillas and are consequently more like flautas, are outstandingly creative and delicious.  The rest of the fairly small menu is also up to snuff.  The only catch is, the service, especially the taking of orders and, even more, the bringing of the check, are on the leisurely scale of a sitdown city restaurant, not of an airport.  If you have less than about 100 minutes till your flight, then FORGET IT.  Don't eat here: you'll expire of a heart attack while fretting over whether the bill will come before your plane starts boarding.  But the food is good enough to make it worth arranging a long layover, or coming here from another pod in the same terminal, at least."}
{"text":"Subpar food and service. Surprising for an airport. At least they usually have quick service. Go somewhere else for a meal here."}
{"text":"I had dinner here once before earlier this year and found the food good...not great...good, in reading the menu I thought that I was In for a real treat....mom and pop restaurant does good with great food.  This time around not so good....I was hungry and Taco,s sounded great, one of the offerings that looked great were chicken tacos covered in a cilantro lime sauce and cheese....YUMMY!!! Not so much, the waitress was sweet and friendly, but the Tacos were tough and chewy...pre made, seemed frozen and reheated.....reheated to the point that the cheese was glued to the plate, chicken dense and thick, and the tortilla shells would crack your teeth if you had ok dental hygiene. The crema and sauce were yummy....not enough to save the dish...  After eating the edible portions that would not crack my teeth, I asked for the check and showed the waitress how tough the tacos were by smacking them with my fork, I asked her to do the same and she did and agreed, I asked her to tell the chefs not to overcook them for other customers.  She returned with my check and stated \"I told them\" with a worried look, and nothing else....I tipped her well as she deserved, and I left...I guess what I have to rationalize is....\"well....it is only airport food\""}
{"text":"This place is amazing...and it's in the airport! I stopped to wait for a delayed flight...thought is have some chips and salsa with a beer. First of all, they have an incredible selection of margaritas on the menu so I ordered one. Fantastic choice. The I caved in and ordered Cochinita Pibil. It's a pork roast that is seasoned, paired with chiles and sour oranges and then wrapped in banana leaves and roasted slow overnight. You cannot imagine.   It was plated with squash, some mashed potato and several corn tortillas. Boom. You're done. An amazing dish, full of flavor and so tender. Delicious. With the margarita it was perfection!"}
{"text":"Don't do it! The drinks are strong, that's my only compliment. I was on a 3 hour delay and decided to opt for a table to nosh while I waited.... I ordered the table side guacamole for $12, so I guess since I was sitting alone I didn't rate the table side service. My server brought a bowl with the ingredients piled in it and proceeded to smash it all together with a spoon. There was so little avocado in the bowl that even after mixing and smashing it all together it still didn't look Iike guac.  So I ordered the shrimp tacos for $14, they were street taco size and I was surprised to see 1 fried shrimp in each taco, that's it! I understand they are small, but come on, I expected at least 2 shrimp per taco! To add insult to injury, each street taco had a huge slice of fat avocado on it.... Guess I know why my guac was so stingy... They save it for the tacos! Not my favorite, even though it's the airport, there are other choices...."}
{"text":"I walked in as a skeptic with an attitude, and bartender Kenneth totally crushed it with kindness, and food of course!  I wanted to stick to protein as much as able. No need for papas and pan. Kenneth took care of my hangry-ness with three eggs over medium and chorizo. Fantastic.  I ponder why no egg chorizo and queso creation on the breakfast menu, other than a green chili item. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"High prices for food and drink. If you have to have Mexican food then be ready to pay up.  3 tacos for $14/$16 1 tequila based drink $11-$14 No chips while you wait.  One good thing about this place, they have free water."}
{"text":"Overpriced greasy food,  not to mention rude staff and waitress. When appetizer was presented she threw plate at our direction and walked off. The bloody Mary was good but I will not come back."}
{"text":"Fast service and good food.  I enjoyed coffee and a bfast sandwich.  It came with REAL chorizo.  Probably not the wisest thing to eat before a flight but it was tasty.  A bit messy though.  The atmosphere was as nice as a general airport restaurant can be."}
{"text":"Man, Barrio Cafe has a very hard time trying to replicate it's original location. I had some extra time at the airport due to a weather issue and decided to charge my iphone for the tenth time at Barrio Cafe. I have given Barrio Queen a chance even though the reviews were iffy at best and found out that Barrio Cafe at the airport could be even further from the original.   Staff sucked: now this may be because it's tough to get people to work at the airport so I will let that slide.   Food: Honest to God, I wouldn't serve this to my dog. I ordered the Tacos De Arrachera (Skirt Steak) and I am not kidding when I say this cow must have either been 70 yrs old or the chef has never grilled a skirt steak in his/her life. Unchewable and absolutely flavorless!   My girlfriend and I are always debating over the Original Barrio Cafe as to whether or not it really is that good. I think one thing they are good at is ambiance. Cool Urban Mexican Art can't make up for a shit show in this kitchen."}
{"text":"Airport restaurants are pricey. This was no exception.  The Pollo Pablano burrito was delicious as was the Borracho Quesadilla.  The service is terrible. We waited far too long at an airport terminal. The drinks were very overpriced and our server didn't know the difference between the margarita and the Paloma.  We asked 4 time for our check.  The only reason our server got a decent tip was we didn't have time to wait for change."}
{"text":"A bit of sticker shock when we sat down, but it was pretty good by Mex restaurant standards, with some interesting items you wouldn't see on most menus. Really good by airport standards, we were 4 for 4 on entrees we'd order again. Can't give it 5*, the price/value/food ratio is a little off, but I would (and will) repeat."}
{"text":"You expect horrible, overpriced food and awful service at any airport restaurant. Here, the food and service is great and the airport premium modest. They were able to do 3 tacos no dairy and Chris is a great server. Selfish, rude, entitled Yelpers ... Seriously. With a long wait between flights you could do far far worse."}
{"text":"Wow, hard finding a quiet, reasonably priced restaurant in an airport so thought we got to a good one.  However, the customer sitting next to us just found a napkin with writing on it in her SALAD!!! And the staff didn't even offer a FREE meal!! Yikes! My fish taco was just okay but I'll avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of airport food, most of it sucks and lower your expectations. This place is excellent. Arizona burrito with fries was delicious, soft pork with just enough sauce to make your mouth water. Be warned the catsup is spicy, a nice kick of hot sweet and salty fries to balance the all meat burrito.   Will come back again"}
{"text":"This location is in Terminal 4 next to the D-1. The Bloody Mary's are spicy and delicious. I've had their pozole and today the free chile chilaquillas with over medium eggs. Amazing. Spice is just right - if you are flying out of here - allow extra time and you won't be let down. By the way - waitress Victoria was super sweet and concerned about your time - so super speedy and prompt!!"}
{"text":"\"Oh, look,\" I say, \"They have a 'to-go' counter.\"  But not an expedient one.  You order off of the menu and then they make your food, and if you're me, then they make the wrong thing and have to make it again.  So twenty minutes later, you can go catch up with your friends and actually board your plane.  They did give me the botch, though, which was a nice bonus.  Food was a little bland and not quite as delicious as I'd been hoping for.  I also found the breakfast sandwich a little difficult to eat while I was sitting on the plane, worrying that I wouldn't be able to bite into the giant bread without squirting over-easy egg onto everything surrounding me.    Sadly, it's about the only restaurant in this terminal, though it looks as though they might be building another one."}
{"text":"Service issues ! Usually come here when I travel to AZ because the Mexican food is different and well prepared. This guy Pedro is so annoying and lazy. The place got pretty busy right after we arrived for breakfast . The young lady was seating people, taking orders, cleaning tables. She called out for help in both English and Spanish. He kept putting her off and never really made himself useful. Irritating! Addendum: food quality deteriorated. Not coming back"}
{"text":"Currently sitting here. The food is pretty good. Typical airport prices. The customer service sucks. I kept having to ask for a refill all the while my cup being visually empty and within eyesight and we were only 15 mins into just being here not even received our food yet(I just happened to be thirsty). Only some of us had silverware and no napkins. A customer from another table tried to ask a waitress for something and before the server gave her any attention the server said \"yeah, I'll be right with you\" the server walked behind me and said \"Jesus\" rolled her eyes and kept walking. Pretty unprofessional to say those things within earshot of other customers. It makes me think that even though I'm paying not only for my food but for their service and what I have to say is not important and that I, as a customer am not important enough to be heard."}
{"text":"Sunday May 21, 2017 7:30 pm 3 of us had 2 hours before our flight and had Barrio Café for dinner. We ordered tableside guac & chips, Ensalada Mata (shrimp cabbage salad) and a margarita. Food was EXCEPTIONAL. Pricey but well worth every penny. As others have said, their margaritas are terrible. Hard to figure how they can make a margarita so bitter and yucky. Maybe \"fresh\" lime juice isn't so fresh. Food was very very good and I will definitely seek out Barrio Café & try other menu items next time. TIPS: 1. Have 2 hours and take your time. It's not for someone in a hurry. 2. Ask for extra cilantro in your guacamole. 3. The shrimp is so GOOD and TASTY, ask to pay for extra shrimp. 4. Lastly, ask to taste the margarita mix BEFORE ordering or get beer."}
{"text":"I understand we are at the airport but this place is awful. Yuck. Although the one in gilbert is okay."}
{"text":"3 hours to kill waiting on my flight. Thank God for Barrio.....food is excellent and the staff are wonderful. One of the best restaurants in Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport!!!"}
{"text":"No bueno for the Barrio Cafe.  The table side guac would have been good had the cold, dripping with oil chips, not also been stale and thick enough to crack a tooth.   Decided to abandon the guac and try more punishment and give their street tacos a try-meh.   Service-The server was indifferent."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant at the Phoenix airport. I've been here many times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and had a pleasant experience every time. The staff is very friendly and the food exceeds your expectations of airport food.   The burritos are a great option for breakfast or dinner (I've had them all). I think my favorite thing here is the Mexican Café. It's a rich full bodied coffee with complex flavors served to you fresh in a French press. I've emptied it every time I've had it! I get it even if I'm flying home at 11p. I risk being up all night just to enjoy the great café!  If you're at the Phoenix airport on a long layover or just want a bite to eat, go to Barrio Cafe! Make sure you get the coffee!  They also have a large selection of Mexican tequila. I'm always in Phoenix for work, so I've never had any of their tequila samplers myself..."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in Phoenix Sky Harbor and in airport restaurants in general. The most important aspect to airport restaurants is that you have to provide prompt service, as your customers have a hard and fast deadline (e.g., plane boarding). For the fourth time in a row, I've had to essentially beg someone to serve me here, and then, after finally getting served, I have to beg them to bring me my bill. The push-button service call buttons must not be connected, as they don't seem to bring the servers to my table any quicker.   HMS Host, you do it right at all the other great restaurants in Terminal 4, including LGO, Zinc, and Humble Pie. I've never had an issue with any of those places. Why can't you figure out how to make Barrio Cafe work correctly?   Yes, the food is good -- once it finally arrives. Too bad I have to wolf it down to catch my flight."}
{"text":"Not bad for an airport restaurant. A little loud whether from the airport ambience or the music played. The food is pretty good and much better than the typical airport fast food. I like the tacos."}
{"text":"Mashed potatoes with \"Mexican\" food? No beans or rice? Horchata that tasted flavorless. The guacamole had cranberries on it. Wtf?"}
{"text":"This place is nicely decorated, staff was friendly and extremely overpriced, even for airport good/drinks. House margaritas are $10 and a chicken salad was $17 at the time of this entry. The food was flavorless and margaritas filled with mix. Save time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Three of us ate dinner here on Monday, March 10th at 7:30pm. I ordered the shrimp enchiladas, and my mother ordered the chicken burrito. WARNING: I popped a shrimp in my mouth and it was raw! They removed my entree from the bill. My mother got FOOD POISONING from her burrito!! (Which kicked in on our connecting flight!) my mother sent them a message on their website and they NEVER responded!!! With all my friends going to Arizona for spring training, I'm letting them all know to avoid this place like the plague!  PS: the food isn't cheap either!"}
{"text":"Drinks are no bueno- chips are extra extra hard- even cut through my gum! Water came with no ice, asked for it twice. Mimosas had the nastiest orange juice ever and the Bloody Mary tasted disgusting. $13 guacomole has about 15 limes in it or tasted as it did."}
{"text":"So understanding I have only been here one time, you cannot (or can.. your choice) take my review as absolute fact.   The menu was rather on the small side, and while I THINK I saw it on some tables, I definitely didn't see it on the menu, and that is, chips and salsa. I dunno, maybe I have lived in El Paso for too long, but damn, chips and salsa? That's not even something you pay for, that's like automatic when you sit down... get with it Barrio.   This is one of very few places to eat in this particular terminal, so yea.. it was hella busy. But That is ok. We honestly didn't wait that long, and had 2 hrs to kill. So win-win I guess.   The menu was kinda small and kinda, I dunno how to put it, but it just wasn't like El Paso. If you've ever been to El Paso, you understand that its actually North Juarez. So yea, cant really get more \"Mexican\" than the Mexican food here... since we are in México. Anyways.... I ordered some tacos, they were OK.. the tortillas was fried or cooked or whatever.. kinda weird. They did have a bunch of tequila on hand, and many travelers seemed to be enjoying that.   Here you go, here is where all 3 stars came from: The freakin double churro and ice cream dessert I ordered. O_M_F_G dude.... so I ordered this dessert, it was basically 2 (rather large) churros, with cinnamon and chocolate powder on top, with this inside made of melted caramel, they were HOT... and they sat on a plate next to a generous scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and fresh strawberries. Now dude check it... I have had churros, from japan (yes they sell them there in movie theatres) to México, I have had some churros.... THIS, this random kinda ehhhh spot in a terminal at the Phoenix International (Sky Harbor) Airport... was the best churro dessert I have ever had. Honestly, the dessert alone was 4-5 stars, but the rest of the place 1-2 stars so it evens out at like 3.   I dunno, if you're in Phoenix, and in this terminal, why not try it out? But then again, why would anyone (voluntarily) be in phoenix?"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. The wait was looonnngggg just to get out drink orders. The chips & salsa were stale & the salsa was bad. I brought this to the attention of the waitress & she told me the chips were not stale, they were just made from homemade corn tortillas. I get how chips work. They were stale."}
{"text":"Nothing edible for nonmeat eaters. The nachos (hold the charizo and the chicken) was just stale chips with honey mustard (for real) dressing on top. Gross. If they let a Taco Bell open up across the isle this place would be out of businesses"}
{"text":"I hope maybe my visit was a sign that this place is turning around a bit. I went to Barrio in the airport on the way to NYC a couple weeks ago. I had the burrito with chicken and goat cheese and all sorts of yummyness inside. I thought it was very good! Very close to the quality of the food at their original restaurant. The service was a bit slow for an airport place, but that means you have to get there a bit earlier. The BF had the pulled pork torta and really enjoyed his food as well. I would say the cons include: expensive, not enough space between tables for a place in an airport...need a little space for luggage etc, and the service is slower than fast casual places (obviously). The pros, however, include: The food is very tasty, the ingredients in my food tasted fresh, they have tasty margaritas, and you're in the airport and not eating at pizza hut.....Hopefully the kinks will get worked out at this location and it can be just as successful as the location on 16th st."}
{"text":"Standard to slightly better corporate-style Mexican fare. Overpriced margaritas are probably the best thing about the Sky Harbor Intl Airport."}
{"text":"At first look this place looks bomb.  I ordered a Cadillac Margarita fir $14.25 and it came out in a glass the size of a shot glass.  Then it tasted like a horrible house Margarita.  Jack and coke was good though.  Then we got chips and salsa for $9.00. Chips had no taste and neither did the salsa.  I wouldn't bring my dog to eat here. Service was nice though."}
{"text":"If you're waiting for a flight at the Phoenix airport (and/or nervous to fly), the Barrio is a great spot for a margarita and liquid courage shot.  I've found myself at this bar twice now, and each time the margarita has been stellar (premium tequila, freshly squeezed lime juice, agave nectar, and Cointreau floater). Can't speak for the food, but the dishes that went past me looked tasty.  Special shout-out to the bartender who 86'd the drunk dude sitting next to me (he was already 6 beers deep!). That's not an easy situation to be in, and she handled it like a pro. I pity the folks who had to sit next to him on the plane.  Prices ain't exactly cheap (I believe my drink was around $12), but I guess that's pretty standard for an airport bar/restaurants. That being said, the Barrio is still a fun place to pass the time before boarding a flight."}
{"text":"Disappointing, even by airport standards. I ordered the breakfast sandwich to go. Although it's advertised as being served with chorizo, I barely found more than a few chunks... 1-2 ounces at most. The cheese was a poor attempt at being \"melted.\" The bread was extremely chewy, like I had to use some strength to pull it apart with my teeth. The scrambled eggs and pico were the only redeeming components, but at $13.00 they were hardly worth it. Obviously the high standards that are applied at her other restaurants are not even a consideration at the airport location. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Five stars for food quality, variety, and atmosphere despite being in an airport. I am docking two stars for speed of service, price, and the general feeling that a portion of the wait staff were actually being held against their will. I felt genuinely forgot about in the latter part of our visit. This was, of course made up for, by the large quantity of butter packets that were thrust at me after requesting one. Otherwise, tasty stuff!"}
{"text":"Service is sooooo slooooww. Waited 10 minutes to have someone ask if I wanted to order. Had 1 beer and nobody came back to check on me. Need my check & it's time to board the plane and nobody is here. It's an airport restaurant, people are usually in a hurry or need  to get on a flight at a specific time. Would be nice if the staff were more attentive."}
{"text":"Almost left because the description of the food was so different from what I expect at a Mexican food restaurant. I am so glad that I stayed! I had the nachos, which were definitely different from any nachos I have ever had before. They were so amazing I couldn't believe what I was eating.   If you give it a try, keep an open mind!"}
{"text":"We just ate at Barrio at the Phoenix airport and went with the waitress recommendations. My husband had the french toast topped with spiced apples and ginger/ orange syrup and applewood bacon. I had a roasted poblano pepper filled with chicken and a fruit reduction drizzled with a cream sauce. Sides were zucchini and mashed potatoes with a flair. It was the beat food we have had in an airport and much better than many restaurants in Dallas where we live!  What an unexpected surprise!"}
{"text":"Hire friendlier people for the front of the house.  Hosts were rude, and didn't even know what was on your own menu."}
{"text":"Meh, pretty much institutional food. My food was cold and just very average. I tried the chorizo and eggs. My wife's chilaquiles also had cold chips.  Breakfast potatoes sit in a tray pre cooked, back in the kitchen. Mine probably for hours.  Service is decent and friendly, and the place offers an ambience that's better than most because it sits in the newer nicer terminal D."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I had the Arizona Burrito, which was actually pretty bland. It came with some spicy fries and spicy ketchup, which was actually the best part of the meal.  Service was a bit slow. Took about 15 minutes to actually receive my beer and wasn't offered a second one til I was about done with my meal."}
{"text":"Great cocktails!  Dont worry food comes fast! I know, pricey, but Barrio Cafe is a Phoenix staple rated one of the best reateraunts in the state.  This airport extended location will get you the basics with the limitted menu.  The guacamole made fresh is one of their signatures. If you cant decide between tacos and something else choose tacos.   The service at this location is great. One of the people in our party asked for ranch dressing which they dont have. The manager went to the resteraunt next door and got it with no questions asked even though we told him it was no big deal (props to la grande orange).  If you're in Phoenix go to the original location, if you have a layover in Terminal D go here."}
{"text":"As far as airport food is concerned, this is about as good as it gets! Great service and excellent fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place has plenty of potential, the premiss is good - latino food in PHX Airport, decor is good, menu is varied and has tempting items. The waitstaff has improved and attentive and interested. The manager is very nice. The reason I met the manager is the food. Ordered the Chilies en Nogada - a poblano pepper filled w/chicken,dried fruits, pears, apples in almond creme sauce. Execution is the problem, dark brown food in a nice soft pepper with light tan sauce and big red cranberries and dried cilantro leaves. Chicken was overcooked! Why didn't they use fresh cilantro? The favors could have been great but I think they are trying too high a scale of cuisine for the location. A smaller menu of all fresh food would not embarrass the chef/owner. P. S. Because of a 2hr delay, I tried the Flan, it was very tasty, but the strawberries were not ripe..."}
{"text":"The green pozole was really good. Happy to see an authentic Mexican soup recipe anywhere, let alone an airport restaurant. Yum. Pozole gets 5 stars. However......This one star was for the service and the guacamole.  My fiancé and I happen to have noticed that we were sitting next to a semi-famous rock musician at lunch (yes, here at the airport). No big deal to us, really, but our server became VERY star-struck when he noticed and was so giddy and distracted. He lingered at the rock star table, and was trying to engage him in conversation constantly. It was really annoying and our service suffered big time.   The guacamole on the menu stated it was made table side by your server, which is always awesome, so we ordered it. Needless to say we were VERY surprised when our shameless server boy quickly dropped off a small bowl of Pre-made guacamole instead of fresh guacamole made table side. Ohhhhhh K.......It's also covered in pomegranate seeds. Not exactly easy to eat as the seeds are not meant for consumption (just the red juicy part around them). It was straight up sour! Soaked in lime juice, and absolutely salty. Disappointing and gross.   I think a restaurant that advertises expensive table side guacamole should actually MAKE table side guacamole. That way there's no chance of F'ing it up with too much lime or funky pomegranate seeds. I also think focused, attentive waitstaff is a must. Barrio cafe just doesn't cut it. Get a better overpriced meal further inside the airport terminal."}
{"text":"Bartenders here are quick and have friendly personalities.... One of the fellas who I talked to last week remembered me and my drink! I didn't eat last time but love the Conchita pibil... They have everything come in from the commissary so I'll update in a few.... They make sangria on site"}
{"text":"Good food! Had the fish tacos and they were pretty awesome. Salad on the side was fresh. Drinks, awesome except for the fact that for a Mexican place I'd say they should have more than one random Mexican beer on tap. Waitress... Umm... In general the staff was below standard and quite interesting but service was at standard at least. I'll be back next time I'm here!"}
{"text":"I was starving after a day of traveling and after traversing every gate in the airport, I settled on this place with my usual amount of heavy skepticism.  I mean really, airport food?  Ugh.  Well this time I made a good decision because I was actually impressed.  The service was friendly, although not the fastest because one of the people behind the scenes misplaced my food for a couple of minutes.  But the counter person realized this pretty quickly and went to find my shrimp tacos as soon as she saw that I was still hanging around.  Four shrimp tacos and a bottled water for $16 seems about right for airport food, and this food was good!  I even liked the seasoned fries, and I rarely like seasoned fries.  I'm going to keep this one on my list since I actually seem to hit the Phoenix airport a couple times a year."}
{"text":"Well I guess they must have read some of the reviews as I got a great lunch - fresh guacamole (one of best I've had) and great beer-battered shrimp tacos. None of the complaints about poor service apply - can't complain. Was in and out in about 30 mins at around 1pm on a weekday."}
{"text":"It's Monday Oct 17th @7:30am.  I've been sitting being quite waiting for my yogurt parfait (it doesn't need to be cooked). It still takes 35 min for it because she said she forgot to put it in. The bartender (Teri) keeps busy. Then she starts hollering at the servers while I'm sitting at her bar. This is rude. She says how it's her first day back from vacation and she's struggling. That's fine, but be nice to your coworkers. The granola parfait wasn't that. It was a fruit plate with yogurt and a dusting of granola. Disappointing.   On another not there's an older gentlemen who seems to be her bar back. He does her job of making sure everyone's takin care of. He's nice. Made sure I had silverware because she only gave me a spoon. He makes small talk. He makes her money. I hope she knows this!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place only has 3 stars, maybe travelers into Phoenix are used to the type of Mexican food served at Chilis.  I had the carne asada a la ricardo and the IPA on tap. The food was excellent, not too spicy but enough spice to linger throughout and cause a few sniffles. It was a generous helping of meat with sautéed onions, tomatoes, garlic and fresh cut jalapeños (not pickled) served with steak fries and the house salsa and spicy ketchup.  I'm a native Phoenician, and I've been missing proper southwest flavor since I moved to northern Cali and this delivered while I waited for my flight back home. It's a little pricey, but it's airport food and I am leaving satisfied, so I'm not going to subtract for that.  Apparently this restaurant has been around in south Phoenix for a while, I'm going to make it a point to stop in next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Came in with my mom with over an hour before our flight. Unfortunately it seems like they sat a lot of people in our waitresses section within a short amount of time because the service was terrible!   Two different groups of people near us got their food before us even though they were seated and ordered after us. Our waitress eventually told us there was a mix up with our order in the kitchen but by that time we had to get our food to-go or miss our flight! We had to ask multiple servers for to-go boxes and our check because each would dismiss our efforts to get their attention. We also saw another woman eating a taco while exiting the restaurant because she was going to miss her flight and her friend had to pay her check.  Thankfully, they only charged us for our drinks because of the inconvenience but we will not be returning the next time we are at the airport."}
{"text":"As far as airport food goes this was pretty good. I had the pork tacos with the side salad instead of the fries. First of all for $12 it was a ton of food. (Fyi my meal was cheap but everything else besides the tacos and burritos were spendy) The tacos were street taco sized but there were 4 of them and the salad serving was pretty generous. The salad was delish and I suspect a lot of it had to do with the cheese. It was unlike anything I've ever had. It's like a cross between a mild goat cheese and cottage cheese. The dressing was really light on the greens too which was great after a weekend of horrible eating. The tacos were really tasty too. On the salty side but the marinade was good and the pork was really tender. Topped with a pico de gallo and more of the cheese. I actually really enjoyed it. Though I ended up scarfing it down like a starving coyote since my first flight got in a little late and it took me a while to order. There is nothing else really for food in this terminal but regardless I would probably stop here again. I would just make sure I had more time to enjoy.  I should note I sat at the bar. This is not for the to-go window."}
{"text":"I love, love, the margaritas and food. I purposely show up at the airport 2 hrs early since usually depart out of Gate C. Seriously the best airport restaurant for food and drink. Best of all I, the food and beverages are the same price as the other airport restaurants."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the slowest service imaginable, why don't you stop on by. I would have ordered food but didn't care to wait. The service staff is rude and I couldn't believe the amount of BS it takes to order a beer. Bad form Barrio, get your act together."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how good this place is and it's inside an airport! I searched out their place in Phoenix, off the hook too!"}
{"text":"I realize this locale is at the airport, so I'll be gracious. But friends, this ain't The Barrio Café you'll find downtown. The food is really terrific for airport food, the service is mediocre, but it's still the airport. The really bright spot was the tableside guacamole that seems similar to the original locale. Chips were okay too, but how can you screw up tortilla chips? The rest of our meal was average at best. I'm looking forward to trying you again and giving you the benefit of my doubts!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here during our layover in Phoenix... I was super excited since I've eaten at the regular Barrio Cafe location in Phoenix, but unfortunately this was a major disappointment!  The service was slow, our waitress was pretty unfriendly, only 2/3 of my husbands tacos had meat, my nachos were ice cold (on top of not really being good in the first place).  Top all of that off with probably the worst tasting margaritas we've ever had.  All the other tables around us all said theirs were lousy, too!  All in all a bad experience. Walk to Terminal C instead!"}
{"text":"Nasty to-go chicken burrito.  It was  boiled chicken in a gravy rolled in a flour tortilla.  yecch."}
{"text":"The service here was prompt and friendly.   Our drink order was taken and delivered quickly.   These are things I look for in airport establishments!    Our waitress was helpful in describing menu items we had questions about.   We ended up ordering both the fish tacos and the steak tacos. Neither was bad, but I wouldn't eat here again as I was not \"wowed.\"  The French fries were blah. The tacos were meh. The best part about our meal was our adult bevvys (cold and refreshing).   Honestly, I've never had more mediocre food. I expected more from Barrio Cafe, but I won't be back again.    I look for oomph or at least a mouthful of flavor when I'm eating Mexican food. This just didn't do it for me.   I honestly think I'd be happier eating a prepackaged sandwich than what I had here.   With other amazing options in this terminal, there's no reason for me to return."}
{"text":"Menu seemed to try hard for Mexican food so I went over to Taquitos at Gate C for street tacos. No regrets."}
{"text":"The coffee is good for the price.  The breakfast potatoes look & taste like they were made yesterday.  The bacon is really good!  The waiter sat two people right next to me.  You know, uncomfortably close & in my space.  There was plenty of seating elsewhere.  I initially had a server that said \"My coffee isn't working today\" making me think they couldn't serve coffee.  Then she explained the coffee she drank hadn't kicked in yet.  OK?  I overheard her tell the same story to another table thus confusing them about the coffee.  That story isn't working, stop telling it.  It's 7:00 AM and we are here for coffee.  Maybe she was new?  My table was sticky.  Next time I'll order a side of bacon and fruit."}
{"text":"Good service, good food but expensive - can't expect cheap food in an airport! Will continue grabbing my pre-flight food at the Phoenix's Barrio!"}
