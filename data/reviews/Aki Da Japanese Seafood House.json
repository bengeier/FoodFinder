{"text":"I have to agree with previous reviewers - Aki Da is passable, but boring.   The location is excellent and the space is well laid-out and a good size - if only their menu, service and food were better, this place would be a hit.   I had the sushi and salmon teriyaki bento box, and shared a shrimp and vegetable tempura appetizer.   The tempura was good, nice light and crispy batter, however the vegetables were not as varied as I thought. Notably missing were eggplant and zucchini. In an order that included five pieces of vegetable tempura, for three pieces to be taro - it's a little disappointing.   The bento box was well-presented, but when I ordered, I thought I'd be getting the \"7 assorted sushi\" as in seven pieces of nigiri, not four nigiri and three pieces of california roll. Quality was average, if rice-heavy.   Salmon teriyaki, also average, nothing special - on par with New Generation Sushi in the Annex. The salmon teriyaki came on a bed of what I can only describe as bagged salad, stir fried heavily in oil. A watery salad and steamed rice accompanied. Miso soup was also included - again, average.   No ice cream was offered to end the meal, which is fine, though I'd grown accustomed to that being included with most bento boxes.   Service was fine, though I felt a little rushed when asked for my order three times in about ten minutes. This leads me to my next point - their menus are laid out horribly. I mean just horribly. Comic Sans on neon paper would have been less offensive to peruse.   In addition to the *four* laminated legal-sized inserts and the wine list, the menu was eight pages long and (this is the worst part) glued to bamboo sushi rolling mats. This makes the pages unwieldy to flip through and quite grimy to touch. The layout of the menu is all over the place - nothing is grouped together except for the appetizers.   All in all, I might go back if I was on the corner of Queen and Woodbine and refused to walk any further for sushi, but probably not. For a sushi fix in the Beaches, go to Bikkuri where you can at least stuff yourself with a variety of things, or to O-Sushi for decent take-out. But really, if you want sushi - leave the neighbourhood to the brunchers and designer dogs."}
{"text":"In the search for something that is as good as Bikkuri, I stumbled upon Aki Da and ordered from them.  If you read my previous review for Bikkuri, then you'd know that I love donkatsu don, but Aki Da's was so bad. The rice was hard, and the meat was the only warm part. It was not tasty at all, it felt like eating card board."}
{"text":"This is the single worst restaurant I have ever eaten at. We came in for a friend's birthday a few weeks ago thinking of getting Sushi. To our delight there was also a Teppanyaki grill so we asked if that was available - they agreed.   About 5 minutes in the chef asked if we knew what they did at a Teppankayi show and essentially whether we could tell him what it was. The chicken was burnt externally and raw on the inside the fish melted on the grill and the wait staff rude and defensive in the face of all this. Since none of us had eaten (it was flat inedible) we asked at least that we at least not pay - the wait staff, however, insisted. When asked the name of the owner they grew shifty eyed.   We've vowed to back and have the charge reversed - this ruined the evening. I wouldn't wish this restaurant or that experience on my enemies - much less a friend.   I strongly suggest you steer clear"}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered five times from Aki Da over the last year or so.  While the quality differs from order to order (sometimes pretty good, sometimes terrible), overall it's a mediocre sushi place at best and recently, pretty bad.  The good: sashimi piece sizes aren't skimpy; the chicken teriyaki my husband always gets is tasty; the unagi is decent.  The bad:   Maki and handrolls are way heavy on rice.  Like, I might as well just eat a bowl of it.  Our latest order, for example, the Hawaii roll was entirely rice and mango, with the tiniest sliver of crab.  I long stopped ordering maki rolls because of this. The sashimi is incredibly hit or miss.  Sometimes, it's decent and acceptable for the price.  And then, you have nights like tonight where the snapper still has scales, the hamachi is fatty, and the tuna is almost grey and tastes off.  It's like food poisoning Russian Roulette.  It's worsened over time, so it seems the place is slacking off and cutting corners Delivery quibble:  sashimi is often packed on top of miso soup, rendering the whole tray gross and warm.  Honestly, you can do a lot better, especially lately.  I only gave them two stars because in the past, I've had reasonably okay food there before.  After tonight though, I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Bah.  This was the worst Japanese food I've had in a long time and very expensive.  I would give it a pass."}
{"text":"despite the not-so-good reviews online.. the sushi house's food is pretty authentic  and looks like they have a lot of customers that pays regular visits there. we had a seafood udon broth which was perfect and a good portion and a sushi combo(forgot the name of the combo..)   the sushi were ordinary tho..  the cooks or sushi makers seems very devoted and speedy but customer service were kinda disappointing..  the decor is cute i think. good location btw  would recommend the udon soup!"}
{"text":"I've had the food here a few times; was never really impressed but others (family members) are big sushi fans so you go along.  Now everyone is convinced it's non-starter."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot, and order delivery quite frequently. The menu is large and most of my experience with the menu items has been really good. The staff is friendly and the service is reasonably quick. During the winter it can be a little drafty if you sit near the door. This restaurant is very kid / baby friendly. When we order in it usually comes to $40 for 2 people with some left overs.  Here are my recommendations: Sushi Pizza, Aki Da maki roll, uni sushi, and crispy salmon and tuna handroll.  Cons: parking can be hard to find"}
{"text":"Had a group voucher for this place and decided to try it out.  We got there and the place was fairly quiet, just a few tables were taken. I ordered a couple of starters and maki for the entree. Another ordered a bento box and another ordered the teppanyaki.   It took awhile for the starters to arrive. The edamame was good, the vegetable tempura was just OK. I've had better. I wanted to get a refill of my tea, but I was never able to get the waiter's attention since he seemed to always be in the back.   Finally the entrees arrived, but the teppanyaki was not ready. The bento box was decent. The maki was a bit off. I ordered crispy spicy tuna and crispy spicy salmon maki. The crunchy bits were covered the sushi like a dumping of snow. I had to use the chopsticks to wipe off all the crunchy bits in order to get to my food. YUCK. Also the tuna was light in colour, I'm used to seeing the tuna darker in colour. It didn't taste like what I am use to having at other places either. The salmon maki was good, but I wish they didn't dump a bunch of crispy bits on top -- it would have tasted better if the crispy bits were in the maki (in moderation!!!).   Meanwhile, we have finished eating the maki and bento box and the teppanyaki entree was STILL not served yet! When it finally came out, it tasted like it has been sitting for awhile. The chicken was cold and the waiter forgot to bring the ginger sauce. I asked him to refill my tea as well. It took him 5 minutes to come back out with the ginger sauce and tea.....  The chicken teppanyaki dish was only a 1/3 eaten, couldn't stomach anymore of the cold chicken. The waiter never once came to the table to clear away dishes or ask how the food was. Waited another 10 minutes to see if he would notice and bring us the bill. At this point the place was getting busier, so we went up to ask for the bill instead. The teppanyaki was suppose to come with dessert, but we didn't want to wait around, so we left.. leaving no tip.  If the food was good, it wouldn't be so bad that it was slow service, but both the food and service were bad. Not going to this place again!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with a group deal. The food wasn't the best with some of the sushi pieces having a funny taste, almost like it had gone bad. There was also another piece that had some kind of fish I hadn't had with sushi before, and it just didn't seem to belong as it tasted like one of those cans of pickled fish you'd get from the grocery store.  The waitress noticed I wasn't making the most of my voucher as I would've had credit left and suggested we ordered something else, which I really liked.  The prices were decent.  Considering the food wasn't the best and to top it up the location is way out of the way for me, I don't see me returning."}
{"text":"This place is not authentic and I had the same experience where I had rotten fish served in my sushi.  They didn't apologize when I confronted them either.  I was so disgusted I forgot to take photos.  But it looks similar of someone's post here on yelp.  I wish I checked yelp before coming here.  I had to pay the full bill too here.  Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Aki Da or should I say Aki Blah.   I think that other reviewers have done an admirable job in summing up the sushi experience here, in that most probably will not return.  Which is a definite shame because Aki Da could easily corner the western Beach sushi market if they cared to do so.  The space is open and welcoming and the location is definitely workable.  Aki Da also offers traditional tatami rooms for those seeking a greater degree of privacy and the centrally situated teppanyaki table is a source of constant entertainment as  teppanyaki chefs wield their knives like swords slicing and dicing their way through anything in their path.  I must say that we didn't even attempt to sample the Eclectic menu.  We simply opted for four Chicken Bento Box combo's, and it's fair to say that maybe we weren't the most adventurous table, and that had we veered off the beaten path we may have uncovered some hidden gems along the way.  Yet the chicken that we did order was rubbery and kind of on the cool side, vegetables were soggy and the salad ( as one observer correctly noted) was swimming in dressing.  So this doesn't really lend itself well to culinary adventure.  The service was pretty slow and definitely lacked personality.   When all things are considered there are just to many good sushi places to choose from in Toronto, and I, like most can safely say that I probably won't return.  But I should note that Aki Da does have potential, they just have realize this and take action."}
{"text":"Couldn't give any lower than this.... Sushi taste like shit rice blend as hell Hot pot thingy the meat are tasteless too  Have to use soy sauce  I can't even..... Literally the worst Japanese (whatever you named it) Restaurant I have ever have in Toronto. Thanks for reminding me there are still shit food here"}
{"text":"I got a avocado roll to go and it was cheap, very good quality and was made in only a few minutes. I'd like to come back, dine in and try more things as their menu is very extensive. The decor is inside is very sophisticated and the servers wear traditional dress."}
{"text":"This HAS TO BE the worst place for japanese food EVER. I wish I was over exaggerating. I went with a deal I purchased on Wagjag. Parking was on the streets wasn't too bad but the store is quite small from the outside so be on the lookout. Came in the restaurant with all the waiter and waitresses speaking mandarin. That was already quite a disappointment. They have quite a large menu and we were asked 5 TIMES if we were ready to order with 5 minutes in between. Obviously not! and by the end of the night I noticed this restaurant really likes their carrots and cucumbers T________T\"    We ordered the :   MISO SOUP AND SALAD CAME WITH OUR MEAL - the miso soup was oddly sweet and the salad.. usually i'll complain about not enough dressing but this was DROWNING in dressing to the point that the lettuce was soft. Also their dressing has alot of pepper.   Golden Live Oysters - GROSS. It was covered in cheese, CARROTS AGAIN, mayo, and garlic. The mayo was JUST GROSS and plus from the smell you could tell this wasn't fresh at all! and honestly, i toke a bite.. and spat it back out.    Okonomiyaki - DISAPPOINTMENT. It was THICK like an inch thick. BARELY ANY SAUCE. each slice had a piece of eel on top that weirdly had ALOT OF BONES. I felt like I was eating a gross slice of cake.   Green Dragon Roll - ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT. The rice was warm and fell apart to the touch. The avocado was warm and mushy. The fish roe smelled weird. and there was WAY to much cucumber.   Regular Sushi (12 pc) Assorted with california roll - Again the sushi fell apart to touch and the rice had a weird smell it wasn't vinegar but it smelled like the chef has been washing his hand with lemon water. Avocado was mushy and they decorated with cucumbers yet again. and the fish has weird colour. Just looking at it knew it wasn't fresh.  Assorted Sashimi (12 pcs) (BEST PART OF THE NIGHT \"SARCASM\") -  It came with 3 pcs  of white tuna, 3 pcs  of tuna, 3 pcs of salmon, and 3 pcs of surf clams. The sashimi was like BLOCKS of sashimi. It was a good 1 - 2 inches thick. You would think thats worth your money but it felt GROSS going down cause it felt like I was eating a piece of  rawr fish steak. The tuna was hard to the bite, salmon was decent, white tuna was decent and surf clams were normal. but its just IT WAS SO THICK. i wished i asked for a knife cause i couldve probably eat it like a steak. T________T\"   SO, that was all we ordered. At this point we were not feeling well, we paid the bill and left. I WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN. expecting it to be beaches area soooo rent should be a higher price i would've expected better food from them.   WAIT FOR THE ENDING, WE PAID THE BILL AND LEFT AND WE WENT TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE NEARBY TO LOOK AT DRINK AND THE WAITRESS ACTUALLY RAN AFTER US. (NOT THAT WE WERE RUNNING AWAY) AND TOLD US THE BILL WAS WRONG. It was $67 or so with our $30 off she wrote $30 instead of $37. We didnt pay attention. We paid with whatever , PLUS IT WAS RAINING. but i was caught off guard with their service that the girl ran after us and also wanted more tips.   this was just the biggest disappointment i've had yet."}
{"text":"One of the places we sometimes choose for sushi! Usually delivery, sometimes pick-up, have never actually stayed to eat on-site! :)  My faves: - yam tempura rolls are great - miso soup JUST RIGHT - good flavour, great consistency/cloudiness factor - edamame arrived hot and salty! It's a pet peeve of mine when it arrives cold and plain!  Something just wasn't right about my inari but I'm not sure what... the tofu skin was very loose around the rice, for one, but it also didn't taste right. Not bad, just off.  Bikkuri is still my #1 choice in this area: http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/bikkuri-japanese-restaurant-toronto?hrid=bq1pJeUqgNaNheBHfnFvyA  But I'm still glad I tried it and I may try dining in too."}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi are always simply delicious and fresh. The chef and staffs are so friendly and nice!!! Best sushi place in the beaches area."}
{"text":"The food is only OK, but it's nice ambiance and the server was very nice and attentive. It was a good place to bring our baby because it wasn't packed, we saw a few other families with young kids. It's always nice to go to a place with lots of space when you have a little one, the taste of the food always comes secondary when you're a parent with little ones.  I had the black cod, which was nice, but they loaded with story fry vegetables that I didn't really like because it's those filler type veggies. Hubby had a fried fish burger that he says was also OK, came with yummy yam tempura fries but had a weird dipping sauce.  I wouldn't want to eat this all the time but it's definitely a good place for the family if you're in the Beaches area."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate so many people had a bad experience here. I only always get the udon soup here and it's very good. Lots of meat and delicious broth. Some friends around the neighborhood come here regularly and have tried a variety of dishes with no complains. Clean place with good decor and unobtrusive polite service."}
{"text":"AVOID! One of the worst \"Japanese\" restaurants I have ever been to. The miso soup was tasteless to begin. Then we both ordered lunch. I had the Udon beef noodles that were OK but nothing special. My friend had the shrimp and vegetable tempura meal which only included 2 types of vegetables (thick sweet potato and thick squash) which were all soggy and mushy. No broccoli, no eggplant, nothing else except 2 shrimps.   When we told the server and chef about our dislike for the meal he came up with excuses and did not offer to take it off the bill even though it was absolutely terrible and hardly touched. Avoid this place at all costs. The sushi itself was also OK but there are way better places to go in the Beaches with much better service."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times before, and was pleased with the food....  BUT...  on my last visit, we ordered our usual including spider rolls. It came out extremely burnt. When I tried to explain the issue, the waitress took it to the chef and came back and said it was ok. They refused to replace it. We obviously did not eat the dish, but were still charged for it.  I've never experienced such poor customer service. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of years ago and it was great. Sushi was fresh and the price was fair. Fast forward to now..  I've ordered delivery from them multiple times and the first time was great. I loved that they had uni sushi, it's something that I always look for when I have sushi. After that, it just went downhill from there. By the time it arrived, it just had this nasty fishy smell and taste. The sashimi was not fresh at all.  The uni was not cleaned thoroughly and I had a bite of sand. I thought it was a one off and ordered from them after several months. Nope.. same thing."}
