{"text":"went here for trivia on a Tuesday night. The waitress was less than ideal, we asked what was on tap, she did not know what they offered and then told us we had to go up to the bar to look at the board to decide (not visible from our seats). Went with three couples who all showed up at different times, we all asked the same question we had to get up to look. Fiance and I both ordered the caesar wrap and BOTH came with large, half dollar sized pieces of plastic in the wraps, one actually hurting her mouth as she bit into it. I later discovered a large piece in mine, but was lucky enough to not have bitten into it. We let the waiter know and said that would be discounted. The bill came we $4.50 off, for TWO separate meals having plastic in them.

Not even half of one of our meals.

Will not be returning and will be telling others to not try as well."}
{"text":"We were attending a wedding in the area and had some time to kill between the ceremony and reception so we came here for a drink and to watch the Badger game. Great bar with a fun atmosphere. Every time the Badgers scored they played the Wisonsin fight song and every passing touchdown they gave out a round of shots. The staff was very nice and helpful, shout out to the man Tim who made sure we were taken care of! Great selection of beer on tap. Will make a point to come here again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The reason I am giving five stars for this review is multifaceted. The first thing that upset me is that I checked the reviews there are only three and two people gave one star while the other guy gave five stars. Obviously there's an issue with those one star people, paint chips as a kid I'm not sure. 

First off, the inside is nice and clean and well thought out. It's a sports bar, and people should review it as such. But when we got our food everything was as I hoped if not exceeded expectations. Patti, our server, was super nice and made the experience that much better. 

Look, this is not a fine dining establishment nor people dressed up in suits and scraping crumbs off your table etc. That's not the point. It's a place with good food and friendly people and a lot of TVs and solid drinks. That's 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and attentive staff. I ordered a patty melt and waffle fries. Texture of meat was tender, but burger was seasonless. Probably one of the worst burgers I have ever had. Fries were crisp and had an appropriate amount of seasoning. Restaurant was across the street from my hotel and offered a free beverage. I don't think I would eat here again."}
{"text":"We stayed across the street at the Fairfield Inn. We went over to this place, which is now called \"It's Time\". Anyway, we sat at the bar and watched some March Madness games on t.v. great bartenders, and the patrons were fun too. Ordered the poutine and cheese curds along with onion rings for appetizers. All were great. I ordered the Reuben and it was massive. I could eat only half the sandwich and barely any fries. All great. Great beer selection. They have a pull tabs machine and we had fun with that too! If we are back in the area we will be back!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place and it definitely got a fresh new look.  We sat right away and place was busy.  Got prompt service for drinks and they took our order right away.  Food was good as we were their for breakfast.  We weren't really in a rush but we did have other places to go.  Should have listened more when the owner came to pre-apologize for the wait 20 minutes in and then turned to his server to say he was going to church.   We still hadn't received our breakfast until after he got back from church.  We waited an hour and 40 minutes for omelets and toast.  Saw our server once after we ordered.  

It was another server who brought our food... Poor thing had to deliver the food and the apologies.  Owner came back over and started apologizing as well.  Funny thing is we didn't get our toast and an order of forgotten hash browns arrived 15 minutes later when we asked for the check.  We didn't mention it because we just wanted to leave.  

I get it... You're busy... Light on staff and a small kitchen.  Change your process and don't leave your staff to go to church.  Give service and not excuses...."}
{"text":"We were told to get the cheese curds and we weren't disappointed! This pub offers some local goods such as fresh cheese and grass fed meats that allow you to get the full Wisconsin experience.

Our bartender was great and made us a custom drink, it was basically like a rum punch but I believe he said it was tequila and it was very delicious - - we told him we wanted something fruity yet strong and he delivered with our custom drink!

A great tip is if you stay at the Fairfield Inn across the street you get a free drink coupon to use so be sure to ask your check in staff for this and we were told we can get one every day that we stay!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu with lots of options.  I loved the Rueben.  For the sports fan, there are plenty of big screen tvs."}
{"text":"Super friendly service and owner walking around. Food was pretty good. It would be nice if they had kid games/activities though. We live close, so we'll be back."}
{"text":"Came in for a late breakfast at 11 but no luck, only lunch available. Good news is it's good!  Had a plain cheese burger with pepper jack cheese and waffle fries.  To be fair, I over cooked my cheese burger asking for med well - so hard to know as it varies so much!  But waffle fries were well cooked and burger was good. Overall happy. Had a free beer from hotel so yah...all good."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place as we were in Verona, and wanted to try something new. 

Before I start this review proper, I'm going to tell you to get their bourbon sriracha sauce. Seriously, I'd go out of my way to eat that again. It's a bit spicy for me, but I'd gladly plow through the slight pain to continue enjoying it. 

We started off with cheese curds. If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll know I'm a picky princess about my curds. These are pretty middle of the road, but still worth getting. Good ranch and they're battered vs breaded, which is always a plus in my book. 

He ordered the big cheez burger and stuck with the provided side of pub chips. He liked it ok, but then loved it after putting the bourbon sauce on. Seriously, this is going to be the theme of this review. Pubs chips are nice and fresh and crispy. 

I got the trio of sliders, which is probably the best decision I'll make this week. The epic burger was good. The beef being on it was a little off putting, but that's strictly a me thing. It works great as a sandwich without the beef, and I just ate it separate. The little piggy sandwich was moist and tender. Definitely worth eating. Here we go. Bourbon sriracha bacon burger. The sauce on it's own is divine. Adding a nice crispy burger and bacon just makes this a homerun. I got waffle fries with my meal and was happy with them too.

Service is friendly, attentive, and swift. Prices are good for portions. Before we started the meal I was going to try coming on a Friday for the fish fry, but I don't know how I'll forgive myself if I skip the sauce. One way or another, we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Breakfast on Sunday

My first experience at this bar and grill since it changed owners and revised its name.

First impressions: huge place with tons of tables; very clean; pleasant servers.

Our breakfast meals tasted great and were priced right....if only they would have  taken less time to get to us.

To our server's credit, she warned us that two huge tables had just ordered and it would take a while for our meals. 

She explained that the kitchen is TINY with just one grill, and the cook was going as fast as he could. And I could see that was true.

But if a place has that many tables, they should have a large enough kitchen to accommodate them all efficiently!

My husband and I spent our 'wait time' trying to map out how to expand the kitchen while retaining as many tables as possible.

Luckily our server and the owner both apologized for our excessive wait. The coffee pot on our table was appreciated, and the food was excellent!"}
