{"text":"The BEST sushi ever. We ordered the combo sashimi, and 3 different rolls. The fish was incredibly fresh and tasty. We were greeted at the door by the owner, and our waitress Sue was amazing! The prices were great--better than most places, and the all day happy hour is an added bonus. The complimentary dessert was a nice touch. Will definitely spread the word, and will return often. This hidden gem deserves much success!"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful!  The food was very good and the prices were great.  The kids liked the ramen a lot.  This is a great new place to try!"}
{"text":"This was a probably the best customer service I have ever had at a restaurant. It is apparent that although they are a relatively new restaurant, they already have regulars  and know them well. The food was excellent, fresh and artfully prepared. We got much more food than we expected but it was so good we finished it all. Not to mention amazing drink specials. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and this place is definitely one of my favorites... Delicious and super fresh! Have been going to Nagoya since they opened and it is my go to sushi place!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here twice for lunch. 2nd time was just as delicious. Owners were very sweet and joined us for a little bit. Clean restaurant and bathroom."}
{"text":"My wife found and tried this place first. She came home so excited telling me that we found our next best spot. I am a regular at Sushi Catchers but I must say that I'm impressed with this place. Very clean and modern. Also big areas for parties larger than 6-8. The sushi was great, service was impeccable and I felt waited on hand and foot. The waiter was super kind and you can tell he values service! I appreciate that so much. I met the owner too and she's such a kind lady. The restaurant layout is open and overall, I would recommend this place. Best of all, the prices are very reasonable and the rolls are just as great as sushi brokers, Sakana or anyone else you'd compare them to. Great experience, thank you!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends a few nights ago and decided to try a new sushi place in town. Coming from California, I'm a bit of a sushi snob and have high expectations. Luckily I was not disappointed. We ordered the jalapeño bomb to start and it was delicious and crispy. We also ordered 5 rolls to share including the chili crab, heartburn Buddha, and Las Vegas roll. The Buddha one was my favorite! Great flavor but not overwhelmingly spicy. The service was a bit on the slower side but everyone was very nice and made sure we had full waters throughout the night. We also got a free mochi ice cream for dessert which was really generous. All in all, we really enjoyed our meal and our wallet wasn't hurting when we left. Happy hour all day makes this place very affordable. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Quit arguing about where you want to eat tonight and come here. Best sushi in az, hands down. All day happy hour. I highly recommend the sushi boat. VERY reasonably priced, especially given the high quality of the food. Would give it more than 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and even better service. A hidden gem must try. This is the best sushi place I have ever been too."}
{"text":"Very pleasant and friendly visit. This was my 1st visit, I notice a nice flow of customer coming in, and the hostess, maybe the owner acknowledge everyone and many seemed as regular customers. the food was fresh and tasty. The setting was simple, but that's what I like. Ill be back."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! The fish was fresh, bountiful, and delicious. The price was wonderful for the quantity that you received and our server was extremely nice. It's a nice relaxing environment and a great family owned restaurant. It's definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad, but $25 for all-you -can-eat sushi is pretty good.  The dishes that we had were tasty and well-prepared and they have many non-sushi and vegertarian items.  So, if you don't mind the quizzical looks and lack of attentiveness, you won't feel cheated."}
{"text":"Sushi taste fresh and great. I had a Shin Ramen, the broth was good, but it tasted too much like the bag Ramen. I was looking more of authentic taste. But they have Happy hour all day and it's a great Lunch Spot!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi fix any day of the week!  The value is unbelievable with happy hour menu all day... everyday. From the Casey roll to the Superstar coupled with a sake bomb what else is there? Food is fresh and flavorful every time we visit! In the Peoria area, worth the detour from the P83... Nagoya Sushi is a hidden gem and worth the visit."}
{"text":"Wanted something close and easy, found the restaurant and parked really easily. Menu is simple to work with. Food came out fast, fresh fish, tastes great, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this restaurant for dinner on a Saturday and were not disappointed. I was a little wary about going to a sushi place with only a handful of Yelp reviews, especially since there are a lot of decent restaurants already in the area, but the reviews were all positive, so I decided to give it a shot. I am glad I did.  The restaurant is roomy and sleekly decorated, although I found it an interesting design choice not to have stools to sit at the bar. Since I don't mind sitting at a table, that didn't bother me. For a new restaurant they had a pretty good crowd.   The service was prompt, the food came out quickly, and I never ran out of water. Since they are doing an all day happy hour, the three rolls I got were reasonably priced, certainly not more expensive than expected at a sushi restaurant. None of the uncooked rolls had any off or fishy flavors, and the fried rolls were not too greasy or oily. The chefs were accommodating about leaving out avocado. My husband, who wasn't in the mood for sushi, enjoyed his bento box and beef teriyaki. It came with soup, a nice little salad and a generous portion of rice.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"They have happy hour prices all day. $5 sake bombs. It doesn't seem to get a lot of businesses but the food was great, prices were unbeatable and staff was friendly, helpful, talkative."}
{"text":"Great service. Fresh food you can trust. We ordered bento sets. Love the fact that it can be customized."}
{"text":"Really good sushi in great prices.  The quantity is big, place is clean, service is really good. A proper 5 star! It's the second day in a row that we came for dinner."}
{"text":"Under new management! The new owner, Paul, we follow him wherever he worked at. For seven years!! Finally, he opened his own restaurant! His sushi is always good! Good amount of servings, no shortcuts! Food always tastes great, not commercialized. Good priced, too!! Our family always go where good food are, regardless of the prize. So we have been to a lot of places where sushi where served, even the expensive ones!  But very few only live up to par, to Paul's sushi and sashimi! Can't wait for his new menu! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Very nice and quick staff! Sushi presentation was very nice and tasted just as good. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This is a new absolute favorite. Please come check these guys out! I have NEVER had such unique and delicious sushi. Try their OMG Roll of the Oasis Roll absolutely delicious. Great customer service everything is so friendly! We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"First, the bad: The service here is AWEFUL. Up to half your all-you-can-eat sushi order may not be fulfilled. It will just never come. They'll stare and inquire as to why you've been sitting at a seat for the last 15 minutes doing nothing, you'll tell them you ordered more, broken English ensues, you order some more. No big deal.  The good: The sushi. For all-you-can-eat, it's very good. Especially the salmon rose, mango salmon roll, and the sashimi (dinner only, sashimi is à la carte at lunch).  I've eaten here for dinner and lunch, and it's always great. It's in the heart of town, decent prices ($25 dinner, $15 lunch). They serve other cuisine, but I've just gnawed on sushi while here. Oh, and they have great vegan / vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to go. Had a very conservative selection. Was very good. Will be back. Looks like Ngoya will be my go to place."}
{"text":"Tasty sushi and good prices. The owners were absolutely friendly and helpful in giving us directions as we were from out of town. Nicer than nice!"}
{"text":"We found this little gem on Yelp and decided to give it a try. The food was delicious! We ordered several different rolls, jalapenos bombs and the boat. The sashimi was so fresh and tasty and all the rolls were as beautiful to look at as they were delicious to eat. The thing that put our experience over the top was the service. A wonderful lady and gentleman took care of us and provided warm, kind and attentive service. We came in on a Saturday night and they were quite busy, but you couldn't tell by the service. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Very good service and the sushi is ridiculously cheap! Not the best tasting sushi I've ever had but it's to be expected with prices like this. The eel sauce and the spicy mayo were also very eh but again I'm all about price as a struggling college student so I'll be returning! (Oh and cheap alcohol)"}
{"text":"Commercial grade sushi, I took chef's choice to try out samplers and it was pretty cheap too (only ~$9). They gave me mostly sushi with cucumber in it so it's basically cucumber and rice wrapped in sea weed and then there was avocado and cream cheese. Rather simple ones. I also got salmon dragon rolls which would have been great if the rice wasn't so bad. The rice was dry and felt uncooked. It's a mom and pop shop so I'm going to give them another chance soon."}
{"text":"C'est un coin près de chez moi, donc j'ai décidé d'y faire un tour. Le coin n'est pas \" omg \", mais le service est excellent, je garde un bon souvenir ! Les sushis sont vraiment bon (j'ai pris les végé) et j'ai bien aimé qu'un thé glacé venait gratuitement avec les sushis !"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi on the west side happy hour specials.The sushi chefs are creative and true artists try a sushi boat for 2 or Bento box they are yummy good."}
{"text":"Nagoya is probably one of the best sushi places in the Phoenix area. It's relatively cheap and always is yummy! Not to mention the people are friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"Freshest fish in Glendale. The sushi toppings are limited but it's to highlight the taste of the fish"}
{"text":"Nagoya is the best value for sushi. My friend and I got an absurd amount of food in their bento boxes; we had the 3 item bento which includes rice, a salad, and miso soup. The 3 piece bento box isn't a cute little box- it's a platter! Tons of wonderful food, great service, and nice atmosphere.   Edit:   I have been into Nagoya again, and the waitress & co-owner of the restaurant, Sue, immediately recognized me. The service and friendliness here is the best around. You will be very satisfied by coming here :)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth the 5 stars! Very clean and very friendly servers! They were busy for a Friday and only had two servers on and they were working hard and still gave great service! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"If happy hour is all day, is it really happy hour at all? Is there a deeper meaning behind all of this, or are we bound to our existential thoughts as the illusion of discounted rolls wrap around us, constricting us, as if to wring our wallets like a towel. But wait, what's this, the pleasant aroma of the ocean. The rolls are so fresh as if they swam into our mouths, leaving only to question, did I eat the sushi, or rather did the sushi feed me. Also, very cost efficient prices!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My husband and I were out and had a craving for sushi and searched for the nearest place. We took our chance on Nagoya since we never been there before and we are so happy we did. Everything we ordered was delicious from start to finish. Service was excellent as well. We could not get over how fresh the fish was compared to other sushi restaurants we've been too. I mean we've had so much sushi over the years and this was some of the most delicious fish we've had yet! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I visited Nagoya Sushi restaurant yesterday for the first time. Sushi Bars are plentiful in this neighborhood. There are 15 to choose from, they are all good and some even great. Nagoya sets itself apart from the rest by not only offering great sushi and other Japanese favorites but the service was much better than the rest. Our waiter was fun, friendly and helpful. It seemed like the entire staff was there to assist us and the restaurant was busy. We ordered three appetizers, tempura soft shell crab, deep fried calamari, and a cucumber salad. The crab was perfectly cooked. The calamari was fresh and crispy and didn't taste like rubber.  For dinner we ordered octopus and fresh water eel sashimi with two seafood rolls. It was all fresh and delicious. Each offering was beautifully presented with immediate removal of empty dishes. Overall it was a very satisfying experience. The price was comparable to the other Japanese restaurants. I give Nagoya five stars for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Great new sushi restaurant! There are many around to choose from in the area but this one has the small family owned appeal where they treat you like one of their own. Clean, friendly, and delicious."}
{"text":"A pleasant place.  Clean, quiet the people are very nice.  The sushi was enjoyable.   And the price is right."}
{"text":"This place was amazing with great tasting food and extremely friendly service. The space was large and clean. The staff was super friendly and attentive even though it was super busy. I would definitely come back if I lived in the area. The food came out fast with pretty presentation and super tasty!! Great place!!!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I decided last minute to go out for sushi and we stumbled upon Nagoya! We were a bit larger of a group but they welcomed us in! The service right from the start was fantastic.  Once we recieved our menus, we realized that happy hour was ALL DAY. I ordered a rainbow roll, spicy tuna and a salmon roll. Others from the group got everything from sashimi to the bento boxes and ramen. No one was disappointed. They even made sure to make a dish vegetarian for some one in the party as well. Overall a warm and awesome first experience, they even made sure to seperate our checks!"}
{"text":"Come here for lunch with my wife. We had the boat special and it was wonderful. The service was polite! Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best sushi we've had in the Valley, hands down. However, they need to hire more waiters because there is usually only 1 or 2 of them. We usually don't mind waiting a bit longer for service because the sushi is worth it. Very fresh and affordable."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, service, and prices. All day happy hour makes it super affordable and the portion sizes are very generous! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nagoya is by far the best sushi I have ever had!! The restaurant is very clean and you can tell the owners really care of their customers! KC makes the best dragon roll I've ever had and he does not skimp on the eel at all! I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I LOVE this restaurant.  I'm so glad it's down the road from my place.  The food and service is excellent...and I'm sorry but the person who said the pricing is a little high even for happy hour is wrong.  I love sushi and have tried many different places, and Nagoya has some of the best prices for the amount of food you receive and the quality.  My favorite so far is the Salmon Bento box with the Tootsie Roll, and the Las Vegas & Rainbow Roll from the Happy Hour Rolls."}
{"text":"The fish just melts in your mouth!  Got the chirashi bowl and was thoroughly impressed by the quality for the price. Chef is so nice and the waitress was fantastic!  I hope to visit again when in the area!"}
{"text":"Not bad! The place is owned by a Chinese couple. They have a straightforward menu, nothing unique. The flavors and quality is similar to what you might find at e.g. Sushi Shop.   The dining room is small and clean. I'm guessing most people buy to go, because there's no table service. So if you're eating there, they will hand you plates and ustensils over the counter. The soya sauce bottles are stored in the drinks counter - you grab them as needed. We ordered a 40 pieces plater to eat right away and a 24 pieces plater to go. They prepared the larger plater first, and given the waiting time, I assume that they made the sushi fresh. There was actually only 36 pieces, but the plater also included four little cups of pickled ginger and wasabi... So I guess it add up to \"40 pieces\"? Or maybe they misunderstood my order and gave me the 36 pieces plater? Who knows. They didn't have any tempura shrimps, so we let the chef complete the combo plate as he wished. It included salmon, tuna, avocado, cucumber and shrimp rolls.   Everything was very basic but nice. Not too expensive!"}
{"text":"my review is pretty much inline with everyone else's. felt like montreal could use a review or two.  anyone in montreal have a computer or internet access?    very good price for all you can eat sushi. they have a wide variety of sushi and dishes you can order.  yup, and again there's chinese people working here. where have all the japanese gone to? as people have said, service needs a bit more attention so you have to flag someone down when you need something."}
{"text":"Nagoya Sushi delivers decent rolls at a comparable price to other sushi restaurants in the Glendale area. But where Nagoya Sushi stands out is the excellent service, which is friendly and upbeat. The rolls tasted great but I wish it was more filling.  What I recommend: -- Spicy Garlic roll with yellowtail"}
{"text":"This is our new go-to sushi spot! The owners are the original owners of Sushi Catcher! They're so sweet and friendly. The fish is very fresh and generously portioned on the delicious rolls. Yum!"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back!  I tried something new; the Superman \"sushi\" Burrito and loved it.  The food was amazing, establishment very clean and the service was great!"}
{"text":"The owner and staff are so friendly and accommodating. The first time I went there they gave my whole group a 10% discount just because it was our first time there. The sushi is also excellent. I always come here when I need my sushi fix. It's not crowded on weeknights so I order take out and it's ready in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is great! I eat sushi all over Vally at  least four times a week and this place is definitely the best. The chef obviously prides himself in quality dishes using the freshest of ingredients. This place will not disappoint  and won't break the bank either! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came in here with zero expectations and wow! My regular sushi place started making their rolls smaller for the same price so I stopped going there. When I came here a week ago, their portions were not only bigger but also cheaper and fresher! I paid $9 for a big rainbow roll here versus $11-12 for a small rainbow roll with less fish. Only downside I could think of was that the rice was a tiny bit dry. The fish to rice ratio is on point though. I now have a new sushi place that's even closer to my house. They even gave me and my friend lollipops after getting our check. Service was quick and always attentive. I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service and great fresh sushi which is definitely the most important. Once a week is a must."}
{"text":"The Chinese owners are everything restaurant owners should be: helpful, nice, flexible and very accommodating.  The salmon used has been fresh and served generously, even in the least expensive rolls.  They have been more than open to the idea of custom-making me ricefree sushi rolls. Very nice miso soup as well.  Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area and have a sushi craving to attend to."}
{"text":"*************June-2-2018*******NEW OWNERSHIP************ Chef KC is no longer there and has sold Nagoya Sushi.  Today it looked like a similar menu and they also offered money saving specials.  The Food Taste Different Now. Portions of fish were larger but not the same. Rice is different. Takoyaki taste different.  Some people might not be able to taste the difference but I can.  Not Bad food but very average.   The help were very pleasant and efficient.  It's possible that the new owners and workers just need to settle in."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch...nasty dragon lady asked  how many in your party? We had only two in our party and she stated we have a big party coming in, we cannot accommodate two people right now. The wait  is 30 minutes or more. I saw plenty of open tables and the place was not that busy. For a new restaurant that hasn't been open that long, that was really rude treatment. We just walked out and will not go back."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after I landed in Phoenix and on my way to a different sushi.  I thought that it was going to be right off the freeway, but unfortunately, it was not- It was more inland and you have to go through the streets instead.  I got the Sex on the Beach roll, a salmon hand roll, and a Bento Box A (beef teriyaki) all to-go.  The Sex on the Beach roll was decent. Maybe it was because I got it to-go, but it wasn't worth the price. If the chefs added a some sriracha mayo on the top or something to add to its flavor, it would be great.  (There was also no soy sauce that came with my to-go order, so maybe that's what it was missing. But they gave me a huge amount of wasabi... Which was useless with no soy sauce).  The salmon hand roll: At first they mushed it together with the sex on the beach roll that i ordered and they cut it up in sushi sizes...  There is a reason why I ordered it as a hand roll. Not to mention they also charged me an extra $2 (on top of the $4) and it came out as sushi? Really? I sent it back because I was not happy. I asked for a hand roll, with no specified instructions on cutting it like a sushi. Maybe I'm too nit-picky and they are simply trying to be considerate of their customers, as it was a to-go order, but if they are going to cut it in that manner, don't have an extra fee.  The good thing is that the waitress asked if that is what I wanted. Once I gave a disheartening look, she took it back right away and told the chef to make it into a hand roll, added some avocado and spice into it and re-packaged it. I really appreciated that.   The Beef Teriyaki came with a salad, miso soup, rice, and a whole load of beef teriyaki. My boyfriend was pleased with the flavor, and so was I. The miso soup was also really good; however, something that could be added would be some seaweed and tofu. Having those ingredients really add to the fun in drinking it, as well as its taste. This is probably the best out of all of the food that I ordered.  All the food came out to be around $27; truly it is not a bad deal, considering the amount of food that I got, but it isn't anything special. I wouldn't make my way out here because their food is just your average; nothing special whatsoever."}
{"text":"I found this place when I was looking for new sushi places to try in the area. The menu looked vaguely familiar, it looked a lot like the Sushi Catcher menu. That's where I use to go and then they changed owners and I went back less and less. My friend and I tried Nagoya on a Saturday afternoon. It's in a very quiet strip mall. I recognized the sushi chef and the waitress as being from Sushi Catcher when I use to go. Awesome! The food was exceptional. We ordered the boat, first time ever ordering such a thing where we didn't pick what we wanted. We were not disappointed. The fish was fresh, thick cuts, and a beautiful presentation. The waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"I'm sort of a sushi snob after working in the industry for quite some time and I gotta tell you this place is great stopped by to night for a quick dinner and every single piece of fish was very fresh Rolls were a great price and a really great value The staff was extremely tenant and nice I would definitely recommend this place to everyone in the area"}
{"text":"I've been to a few all you can eat sushi spots in Montreal, but this one kills it. Even though the price is similar to other plaxes (15$ for lunch and 25$ for dinner), Nagoya differs by its impressing variety of sushis and dishes. As it was said by many fellow reviewers, the service isn't the best.. but the kitchen still manages to be really fast even though you've ordered tons of sushis! Plus, for non-sushi lovers, there  is a vast variety of chicken, meat, and veggie kitchen plates included in the all you can eat menu."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their spicy tuna rolls are the best in the valley, the price is also something you can't beat. I recommend this place to everybody I know that likes sushi."}
{"text":"Excellent choice. Highly recommend. The sushi was fresh and tasty. The service was fast and friendly. Looks like it is a family run operation and they take great pride in their service and food. We will be back."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant. Good sushi rolls. Everyone is friendly. However if you call in an order and they day 15 mins. You come in 15 mins for pick up and they tell you another 15 mins. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. As a Japanese family we are particular about where we eat out for Japanese food and this has made the cut. They have a very good diverse menu. I like the bento box it is such a good deal."}
{"text":"Like all all you can eat places, don't expect the best quality food. I mean, you get what you pay for right???  I think this place is great - it is opened actually, not sure why it says this place is closed. The restaurant looks trendy inside and its actually kid friendly! The food is decent and the service is good."}
{"text":"I love them so much. The place is small and so is the staff so it makes it a very personal experience. The fish is ALWAYS fresh. Good portions for the price. My family comes here weekly. The employees remember us and are always kind to my son. I'm happy to have a great sushi place in the west valley. Personally, it's my favorite place out of any other sushi restaurant on the west side and trust me, I've tried plenty of them."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite sushi places!  The owners are so nice and welcoming.  The service here is 5 Star!!  I love the quality of the fish is comparable to the expensive sushi places you go to in Scottsdale!  The price is amazing for the quality that you get and I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Very good... we really liked the Superman Burrito and Spicy Buddha one plus others didn't disappoint either. Very friendly owners and fast service. Happy hour all day is a plus too. We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and even better people! We went for my husband's birthday and they were more than accommodating for our large group. Very patient and everyone got a sweet treat at the end. Nobody in our party of 14 had ever been but we all said we'd be back. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"New favorite sushi spot! Have been here twice in a month already and everything from the service, to the fresh fish, to the atmosphere and the prices are PERFECTION! I recommended his place  to anyone asking for a sushi recommendation and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Oishi!   I approve! Big parking lot, clean interior with music just loud enough to still enjoy good conversation with company.    Decent sized menu with all day happy hour on certain rolls. Ended up getting the Boat combo which is composed of chefs recommendations for 2 specialty rolls, sushi and sashimi. Let me just say...that big boat of deliciousness was definitely worth it! Each and every piece tasted sooo fresh! Our boat came with fresh yellowtail, salmon, tuna, and tilapia sashimi style, octopus, shrimp, unagi, and albacore sushi, coupled with a Rainbow Roll and a Casey roll how could you go wrong! Thanks to the chef for the amazing recommendations! I'd say overall, it is well worth it to stop by if your in the mood for some great sushi!"}
{"text":"This place was great. The sushi was fresh and the prices were very reasonable. We got a sushi boat with a variety of sashimi and sushi rolls for $35."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Met the owner and staff. It has never failed to be good. Expect more of a family dining experience tham amything formal. I highly recommend who like good sushi and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really like the ambience and the sushi is fresh. Nice casual atmosphere. Great service! I will definely come back!"}
{"text":"Really good and inexpensive. Perfect spot for lunch. I heard they have all you can eat sushi for $15 at lunch and $25 at dinner. Not quite sure if there are stipulations, but it sounds nice.  My spicy tuna roll was delicious, as were some of the makis I tried, but I'd avoid some of the other weird tuna and shrimp combos."}
{"text":"Best. Best fish in Arizona hands down.  They are the original Sushi Catcher on Bell.  They relocated here. Amazing quality."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi and the price can't be beat. My family of three can get full under $30 and we can eat a lot of sushi."}
{"text":"In from out of town and found this local gem. Super Fresh food. All made to order. Great with food allergies as someone who can't do gluten or eggs. They did gluten free/egg free fried rice ($9) made with chicken breast and an awesome avocado roll ($4). Family was also happy with their meals as well. Great rainbow roll ($7) and shrimp tempura roll ($5) and you CAN NOT beat the price!!!"}
{"text":"Driving the extra 20 minutes to find this place was totally worth it. The happy hour deals are on point, my favorite would be the Casey roll. SO GOOD! Also  would recommend the Bento Box to get the most bang for your buck, so much food! Great prices. Bathrooms were also clean, our server was nice. The sushi is fresh and delicious, I definitely would return again."}
{"text":"The sushi is amazing. The prices are very reasonable also. I recommend calling ahead and placing order if you decide to do take out.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"So if you're looking for a new sushi place under no circumstances go here.  Moderately busy but took nearly ten minutes before anyone acknowledged us or sat us.   Then after ordering it took 50 minutes for our food to arrive.  The food itself seemed adequate though the chef doesn't have the knife skills to ensure even and clean sushi.   Fast forward a few hours and on comes food poisoning complete with wracking chills and an inability to keep anything down.  I have to say definitely avoid Nagoya Sushi."}
{"text":"Good sushi has a bento box option 7.50 to 12.50. 1 to 3 items. Would go again great local spot reasonably priced. Always happy hour!"}
{"text":"Nagoya sushi is just right across the street from my house and we just now decided to check them out. I wish we would of started eating here sooner. I have only good things to say. I'll start with price, they have happy hour all day on sushi and drinks. They also have bento boxes for $10 which come with your choice of chicken, beef or salmon, you also choose your sushi roll, and it comes with salad, rice and miso soup. Everything was beyond delicious and very filling. If you don't want a box you can order off the sushi menu, all the rolls range from $4-$9 and the rolls are huge! We tried the tootsie roll and it was a really big portion. The restaurant is a little smaller so it isn't too noisy. It also was crazy clean! The service was outstanding!! The owner went around and talked to every table and it looks like there are several locals that come in every night. If you have a lot of people returning you know the food is good. I loved how friendly everyone was but I also loved that I can see them making my sushi and also grilling our food so you know everything is fresh. The owner gave both of my boys bowls of ice cream with chocolate sauce on the house. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So today my daughter and I decided to have lunch, first thought was Mexican food over by Arrowhead Mall. As I was driving, I thought, no Sushi sounds better and I want to try this place again.  First time I ate here was a few months ago with some friends I cycle with. It was fantastic and definitely worth another visit.   Being the sushi lover's that we both are, we are all about the Sashmi with a side of rice in a bowl. We decided on the Sashmi Plate - B with 35 pieces of fish (we can eat some sushi :-)), ordered the special - Smoked Grilled Salmon, and house salads.  OMG, the quality and size of the sashmi was excellent, nothing better than having the fish melt in your mouth. We could not get enough, even better the owner made us a small side of the lunch special - Sashmi salad, which consisted of 3-4 different kinds of fish with cucumber noodles. Delicious, we were treated very well, the owner came over a few times to check on us (he must have known by the looks on our faces that we were serious about our fish). Can't say enough good things about our experience, we will definitely be coming back.   The place is clean, parking is easy, the owners were warm, friendly and super attentive.   Thanks to my friend Glen Brown for introducing me to this great restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh sushi.  Super friendly staff. Quick service. I would give more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour ALL DAY. We always order too much. We order one of the Bento Boxes. That comes with Miso soup (and they bring us a bowl for each of us) a meat entree, rice, a sushi roll and gyoza. We got that plus 2 more sushi rolls all that for $28! Everything comes out quick. and everything is good. Best sushi bang for your buck in the area"}
{"text":"So in the past when we went to Nagoya when it was under its original management things were awesome and the sushi was always amazing. UNFORTUNATELY Nagoya is under new management and my experience there tonight was not one that I think I can forgive. We had a party of 7, but we arrived at 6:30 and were seated promptly. We ordered by 6:40 and then the waiting game began. To their credit there was another group bigger than ours behind us but they were ordering predominantly non sushi items and lots of beer. We got our first round of sushi around 7:30 and the 7 of us went through that really fast. Our drinks did get refilled pretty often during that hour, but by 7:40 we  put in another order of sushi because most of us were still hungry. This is where it get ridiculous. 8:00 rolls around and we have nothing,then another 30 minutes go by and we are finally brought 1 of the rolls of the 6 new ones that we ordered. Then another 20 minutes goes by.....that's right it is now 8:50 and the waitress (who had stopped checking on us) comes and asks how we liked all our rolls and we inform her that we have only received one of them. She goes back to check and says that the chef is backed up (which we kind of figured on our own) and that it would be right out. Another 15 minutes go by. It is now after 9pm (WE HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE 6:30) and the last of the rolls come out. We literally inhale them but don't dare order more because we are all just ready to leave at that point. Then it takes another 10 minutes for the waitress to bring us our bill! When we receive the bill all she asks is did you guys have to wait a long time? To which we replied yes, but we realized they were busy and that we were trying to be understanding. She did apologize, but no effort was made to remedy the situation. I'm not asking for a free meal, but we spent are pretty good chunk of change there and they didn't comp anything. Not a drink. Not a roll nothing. We had been there for almost 3 hours. On top of all this the air conditioning was not working or something so we were sitting there roasting the entire time. The new menu does not include the Casey roll or some of the other awesome ones that the previous owners had. I was so excited to take my dad there for Father's Day and my husband for his first Father's Day, but by the end of the meal when we were finally able to leave we were all left with a bad taste in our mouths for Nagoya. I can not say we will be coming back again. So disappointed."}
{"text":"If you like sushi, you have to come and check out this place! Great genuine excellent service! The food is delicious and prices are not bad at all! Do yourself and someone else a favor, come and treat yourself to a great meal with great service!"}
{"text":"Got to this place with my wife and a friend at 9:26 and i walk in, but a guy comes to me and tells me they are closed, even though i showed him the schedule that was posted on the door, so i had to leave. They were supposed to be open until 10 PM.  Horrible experience! Never coming back."}
{"text":"I rarely go out to have Sushi. However, whenever I come to Nagoya, it is to spend time with my Mom for a bit of  \"catch up\" time with her and it is the perfect place to do so.  I have only been to their location on St Catherine Ouest but I love it.  The food is amazing, their chairs are comfy and they have a couple of tables to offer you if you want to sit outside during the warmer months.  We don't usually have time to stay for longer than an hour (lunch break) so we choose their take away options and sit inside until it's time to go.  The staff is extremely kind.  The one thing that is odd is that the one room washroom is very close to the service counter... it's a bit awkward.  However, the entire area is very clean and sanitary.  They have good prices for what you get and it is overall, quite the great place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"This is a little Mom and Pop restaurant that's run by the friendliest couple ever. Sue runs the restaurant and doubles as the house manager/waitress. She's super friendly and takes time to get to know her customers. At Nagoya, I never feel like a number or a dollar sign. Sue gives her customers so much more than hospitality - she makes you feel like an old friend or family. I could keep raving about how amazing the hospitality here is but I know why you, my fellow yelper, are reading this. You want the deets on the food. Without further delay here is what you need to know:  I have ordered sushi, sashimi, takoyaki, ramen, and the bento combo from here. None of it fell short of expectations. I've been dying to find a decent place for sushi out here on the west side, and I'm happy to announce I have finally found it! The sushi doesn't smell (because you Yelpers KNOW that has to be a thing when you're dining at a sushi restaurant), and is actually fresh. There is a fantastic variety of rolls for you to choose from, and the pricing isn't bad! There are also some great sweets for you to order if you've got a sweet tooth on you (mochi ice cream, anyone?)!   I could keep gushing about this place at the risk of losing a table, but at this point, why are you still reading? You're clearly hungry and want sushi. Just try it! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food was great. For the amount of food and its price. You can't beat it. I'll definitely pay another visit. The only problem was that the service needed some sharpening. They were definitely still new to customer service and waiter had to come by my table 3 times to double check what I ordered. The worst part was at the end, he still gave me with wrong food lol. But they were new so I didn't hold that against them. But that was the reason why I gave this place a 4 stars. If the service was better, I'd easily give 5 stars to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great good with great service! The owners gave us free appetizers and also gave us some rolls on the house since they ran out of one of the ones we wanted. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Sue treats you like family. The sushi is just as great as I remember. Great prices and a nice  all day happy selection including $5 sake bombs as well . Give it a shot Sue will make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Very good sushi sadly is not next to home! The travel is very worth it the lobster sushi is to die for! (So I believe that was the name. ) it had this rich cream on top with some lobster bites that melted in your mouth."}
{"text":"Give place . Very good food, reasonable prices. Our waitress attentive. Will come back here for more sushi"}
{"text":"I really, really liked the food here. We had the Vegas roll, Casey roll, popcorn lobster roll, and the egg rolls. The sauce for the egg rolls was awesome. The Vegas rolls were perfect. Every thing tasted very fresh. The prices were reasonable and the service was great. Very friendly. I assumed it was the owner that checked on us, but regardless they were great."}
{"text":"The most delicious sushi in town!!!! The fish is so yummy and the restaurant is very nice and cozy. The service is amazing... I could give this place more stars if I could! BEST sushi in town!"}
{"text":"........I was exhausted and drained so I decided to go to bed and sleep.  And to sleep I went, next thing I knew I was in a massive oceans filled with fishes everywhere...wiggling and swimming they were. I yelled \"stop fishes!!!  Get in my belly!!\"  All the fishes stopped what they were doing and turned to stared at me, one fish swam to me boldly and said, \"so do you prefer us fried, baked, or steamed?\"  I replied, \"None of the above, I'll eat you all raw and wiggling.\".......Unfortunately that didn't get to happen because I've woken up.  I woke up with a craving for sushi.    That night my friends, my sister and I decided to give Nagoya Sushi a try since it was on our way to our final destination. The setting was standard at best, if it weren't for the sushi chef staring at me I would think this place was McDonald's or Something, just kidding.........halfway.  The staffs were very nice and services was fast.   As you know I ate a very light lunch prior to coming to this place, I wanted to have a big appetite!!  We ordered a few rolls to share, just a few, because we each ordered their sushi burrito too.  By the price, and seeing many sushi burritos in the world, I was under the assumption that this burrito would be big, huge, larger than life...stuff with fish, and avocado and imitation crab meats and the works! And boy was I wrong, I was hit with great disappointment.. it was smaller than your standard issue frozen burrito from Walmart!  It was probably only slightly bigger than a roll... Regardless I ate that sucker which was delicious and fresh.  But I was so disappointed I had to use the loo before heading to our next location starving....  Overall an average place, the fish was decently fresh, but sorry I didn't get my bang for the buck.  Will not be ordering their burrito again."}
{"text":"Tried this place as it was convenient to our next stop, so glad I found this little spot. I came in a group of 4 and we all 4 thoroughly had a great time.    For drinks, pretty basic, green tea and soda etc, we ended up just getting waters. The setting was pretty simple, basic, and more like quick dine in spot, nothing too too fancy.  Our server Sue though, was on spot from the moment my foot set in the door, she was the sweetest. We were greeted and kindly welcomed.   Now, the food, was BOMB.COM, Nagoya has probably the best, tastiest and freshest sushi I've EVER had. I had their jalapeño bombs (deep fried, stuffed with cream cheese and tuna), tootsie roll (avocado, cream cheese and shrimp tempura) and the super man burrito (crab, tuna, salmon, avocado wrapped with soy paper). Let me tell you it was all very delicious. The super man burrito was a bit small but perfect if you plan on trying trying other dishes.   -1 star because the pricing was a little too high even off the happy hour menu... The quality was great and worth it but if pairing the price to the aesthetics, the setting and the quantity to the food, it's still a bit on the high tide, will that stop me from surfing by?! Not at all!"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite place to eat! Sushi here is always good and fresh. If you go during lunch definitely try the sushi pizza special (my go to)."}
{"text":"The sushi is the best we've had in Arizona! Super fresh and delicious. We love their nigiri  and both the tootsie roll and the buddha roll. The staff is super attentive and friendly. We won't be eating sushi anywhere else from now on!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is everything I want in a sushi spot. The owners are nice, the food is delicious, and the prices are fair. The spicy garlic roll with yellow tail was my favorite."}
{"text":"First time Yelp review for this common Yelp user. I felt compelled to write my first review after the experience my wife and I had with my sister and brother-in-law. We are sushi connoisseur's and let me tell you, this place is THE BOMB!!!  From the rolls to the sashimi you will not be disappointed. The owners are terrific as well and will no doubt cross your path with a greeting. We can't wait to come back, thank you Nagoya!!!"}
{"text":"Great little sushi place and such friendly service!!! I've been waiting for a good sushi place in Glendale. Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere was awesome. Would definitely go again and recommend anyone else to try!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Found this place by mistake, wasn't the greatest but for the price it was really good. Came at least once a week for a roll here and there. Started noticing changes and I can't say they are for the best. The service changed as well. And each time I ordered something has been missing or not right. The last month. The manager fixed it one of the 4 times but today was kind of it. Nothing offered infact when the \"fixed\" my order this time it was still wrong and then they handed it to me and ignored me completely. Love to support a hole in the wall but it's so hard when they lose focus of why they were so good."}
{"text":"we came as a large group and were seated upstairs for the all you can eat menu. the price is right and the menu is awesome given that there are so many choices and the appetizers are actually really good. however our orders were constantly being mixed up and we were being served sushi that our table didnt order. it's a shame they closed because i was hoping to come back the next time i am in montreal."}
{"text":"I feel like I really need to write a review for them. Their salmon poke bowl is way too awesome. I came here a few times a week only for their salmon poke bowl. And this time I brought three friends with me and we all ordered the same dish. Not only is their salmon always fresh, it is always  a very generous portion. The avocado that is used in the dish (and every other dish) is always at the perfect ripeness. The sauce used in the poke bowl (apart from spicy mayo) is different from other restaurants', which is why I love it so much; it's a sweet and savory sauce made from sautéed mushrooms and aromatics. The taste, texture, and presentation of the poke bowl are outstanding. Even their price is unbeatable, at $12.45 for a very fair portion. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Fish Fact:  Salmon is technically a white fish. It gets that orange color from a diet of crustaceans.  I'm catching mad feels over here.  The quality is so fresh at Nagoya --- I swear they just plucked an avocado off a tree out back!  The cuts of fish are thick and consistent, nothing smelled fishy, and everything tasted great.  The only way this place could have been better is if they offered fresh wasabi.  Happy Hour has some fantastic deals and they even offer sushi burritos here [though they're definitely on the smaller size].  Nagoya Sushi is a super clean place with a modern feel.  The staff, especially Sue, are super friendly and cheery.  I do think some of the prices don't match the environment and portions but I'm willing to come back and give them another chance to bump the star to a five.  This place is 4.5 stars easily but 1/2 stars do not exist on Yelp yet so four stars it is!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here due to the great Yelp reviews they have received and somehow we still left surprised about their GREAT prices with an all day happy hour and the customer service from Sue(owner) made the meal 10x better although it was already perfect. Extremely tasty and cheap, usually Im skeptical about cheap prices because the taste usually tends to suffer but boy was I wrong, I would recommend to any friends and whenever I stop by Arizona I'll make SURE to stop by. Wish I could give it a 10/5."}
{"text":"So impressed.  This was some of the best sushi I've had in a long time. Wonder service, fantastic food"}
{"text":"I loved the food here and the service is amazing. Very fresh and big portions.  The employees aim to please, very friendly and make suggestions to what is super popular."}
