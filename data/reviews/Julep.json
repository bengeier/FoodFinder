{"text":"All aspects of the experience exuded high quality and care.  The food, service and atmosphere were unique, thoughtful and added to the great dinner I had.  Great addition to Madison!"}
{"text":"Julep was fantastic tonight!  I had the chili and corn bread The chili kicked my socks off, it was so good! The corn bread was made to perfection!  The serve was excellent"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I  took a larger group of work people out for a business dinner. It was so much fun!  The environment is super chill! The hostess was super nice and accommodating. The waiter was a little unfriendly but who cares - the food was amazing! The perlou was the best thing I have ever eaten ever! I am so going back with non work people! And back again with work people for sure! This place is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The best part about this eatery is the ambience. It's a bit too casual/a bit on the unprofessional side. The woman who poured our drinks was swallowing food every third word. She had a snack in one hand and pouring our water in the other hand. As she left our table she took one big bite out of her snack. I just have never experienced someone eating while working on the restaurant floor. We ordered the shrimp fritters and they were delicious-good flavor and texture. We also ordered the Blue crab cake, Nashville salad, and shrimp & grits. One thought was that the last 3 dishes all had the same taste, nothing stuck out as interesting in a positive way. The 3 dishes had one level to them. The Nashville salad was a bit too sweet. The shrimp & grits was more like soup then real grits-very saucy. Not true southern grits. The blue crab cake tasted very similar to the salad. The small plates and main dish was not flavored or seasoned well, which created a blah taste in the overall experience. We did not do dessert.  Overall, the space and menu is trendy/new, but not solid nor exciting. The staff were kind. The ambience was nice. The price point was too high for the quality of the food. The food was meh-okay. We probably won't be returning nor recommending this place. I hope through some more time they can polish off the service and food."}
{"text":"Just like mamma made - if mamma had formal training.  I heard the shot gun shell decorations were provided by Harry Whittington himself!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered chicken, and it was raw in the middle.  The waiter apologized and got a new plate made.  But this kind of health risk shouldn't be tolerated in a restaurant.  The other food and cocktails  were ok but definitely not worth returning."}
{"text":"It was my first chance to give Julep a try and I loved it! I enjoy a citrus style cocktail and the Watercolor Water Buffalo was perfect for me. Great price point too. So far hey are serving light snacks and I tried the special- fried green tomatoes with an egg salad and sauce gribiche. Omg, it was delicious. The pimento goat cheese was so tasty and the homemade crackers were killer. I can't wait to see what Julep's dinner menu will reveal. I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Julep is WONDERFUL!  Fantastic Southern food and service.  Don't forget to order a biscuit!  Also - the mint Juleps are tasty."}
{"text":"First time here tonight! Cute decor and lovely atmosphere, tried the Perlou and it was amazing. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Julep is very successful in capturing the spirit of Southern comfort food and hospitality.  The space is beautiful and looks out into a courtyard that makes you feel like you've left Madison behind and entered a much slower pace of life.    I've gone three times so far and had the risotto and mac and cheese the first time and the black eyed pea salad and corn bread the other two times.  All delicious, but that black eyed pea salad was to die for! It may not be the obvious mouth-watering choice, but the flavors are so good together.  If you are looking for something meatier, my boyfriend is a sucker for the fried chicken--he raved about it! Definitely give this place a try.    Like others have said, it shares a hallway with Barolo and A-OK, which are both great places to get a before or after drink!"}
{"text":"Decent, but not up to par for their price point in Madison.    The corn bread was fantastic, but the rest of our food didn't fair quite so well.  The mac & cheese gratin was good, but not great - a little heavy on the mustard.  The tamales were fair, at best, and the perlou was similarly disappointing.   All in all, the food was not unpleasant but did not come close to meeting our hopes.  There are many better choices in Madison, plenty of which are lower-priced than Julep."}
{"text":"Took out of town family and friends to Julep to celebrate my son's graduation. Everything --- the space, the service, the food --- perfect! The space should be featured on Houzz. Upscale, stylish, and welcoming. Eric served our group seamlessly. The brunch choices were varied and delicious. Thank you, Julep."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for several ladies and myself to enjoy a weeknight dinner at Julep. We were warmly greeted by the staff who was happy to accommodate our large group and the extra people who showed up. The building is cute and there is ample street parking off of East Washington. However, since this is a mixed used building it's a little odd walking by the coffee shop to get into the restaurant space. Unfortunately it was too cold for us to sit outside but the interior is equally beautiful. Julep is a lovely and well thought out space and I wish the menu lived up to the decor and staff.   Since this was a few months ago, I forgot what I had ordered to drink but recall that it was tasty and that I had several! The biscuit was bland and I didn't finish it. I should have known to stop there but I didn't and ended up ordering the crab cake. This was my fatal mistake! The cake was presented well and the cucumber salad (if I recall correctly) that accompanied it was tasty and light. The crab cake however was extremely under cooked and in all honesty I should have sent it back but I did not. The next morning I woke up extremely I'll and spent the next 24-36 hours on what felt like my death bed. Do I know if Julep's bland under cooked crab cake caused me to get sick? No. But I do know that because of what happened shortly after dining there that  I won't be going back.    Julep tries to do a nice dinner service but the food is lacking on many different levels. If you are looking for a southern meal save yourself the time and money and learn how to make yourself some biscuits."}
{"text":"Oh Julep, where have you been all my life?!? I've wanted a restaurant like this is Madison for so long, and it's finally here. It's incredibly well decorated, down to earth, and has a small menu that's both fun and packs a punch.  It's also part of the ROBINIA COURTYARD!  I can imagine hopping to Barolo and/or A-OK while waiting for a table at Julep on a busy night, which is so cool.  I'm really into that concept, it makes coming to E Wash worth it.  I had the perlou as a main, it was amazing!  The smokiness from the fish, the refreshing bite from the salty briny oysters, and the crisp rice grits combine for sheer joy.  My friend who's veg had the farro risotto, it was rich and delish.  We also split the crabcakes, cornbread,  pimento, and mac for the table. The small plates were great for sharing and all super good.  I also stole many bites of collard greens from my friend, while he was in the bathroom.  I highly recommend doing this because those collards kick butt!  I'll definitely be back to try some of the other options!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Grew up with southern mother and spent half my childhood in the south. This is the best shrimp and grits I've ever had. Don't miss the biscuits. Amazing. The pulled pork is pretty good too and Sunday brunch has some different options that are really well done. All the flavored are rich and complex.  Try this place - you will love it."}
{"text":"What a wonderful jem of a place that seems to be tucked away in secrecy?! Delight prevailed from  the moment we walked in to when we left. Cocktails were a pleasant start and then to dinner that was served by a pleasant server, with the food being delish and hot from the kitchen. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food was decent enough, but the prices were high for small portions and the service left a lot to be desired. The host didn't even acknowledge us for a solid ten minutes, even though she saw us while she was watering tables for servers and doing various other things. The restaurant was not busy on a Monday night, about a dozen tables were seated when my party of three arrived. The host sat us and said she would come back with water, which took 7 minutes. The server finally arrived and my friend ordered a diet coke, which literally took 10 minutes to arrive, then the server dropped off the soda and disappeared again without taking our order.  We were seated 20 minutes before being able to order. Again, the place was not busy. We ordered an appetizer, which arrived after the main meal. The food itself was excellent. Delicious cornbread. But I definitely won't be going there again, nor will I recommend it to anyone that doesn't want to pay a lot of money for pretentious food and terrible service."}
{"text":"We found the food to be exceptional for A three generation group. We tried a number of courses and found each to be tasty and unique. We used the recommendations of prior reviewers and found them to be great choices! Attentive, pleasant waitstaff. A great addition to Madison's culinary choices."}
{"text":"This place has potential - but it is certainly not there yet.  It is a clean, warm, inviting restaurant, very welcoming.  Our waitress was somewhat friendly, but had that laid back attitude that said she'd rather be elsewhere.  That said, let's get to the food:  The Black-eyed Pea Salad was phenomenal - alot of depth, wonderful flavors that I wondered at the description how they would mesh - loved it - a hint of heat from Serrano peppers, a bit of smoothness from farmer cheese, tang of chow chow, tender and flavorful black-eyed peas, and the thing that brought it together was the smoked tomato vinaigrette.  would definitely order this item again.  I have travelled the south and order Shrimp and Grits whenever and wherever I can.  This was a disappointment.  It is completely overpriced for three shrimp and tiny bits of ham.  It was very one- note in flavor:  simply no depth.  It tasted mostly like cream and the sliced red onions that predominated the dish.  There were also sliced red and green peppers, which together with the onions, had they been sautéed or caramelized, would have given the dish some flavor.  I left tasting onions for a long time - not good. The shrimp were tender and had good flavor.  We also had the Perlou, which was okay - really like refried rice, which was also totally overpriced. The smoked whitefish was the best part of the Perlou. My husband felt the oysters were just not the right texture in this dish.  We really wanted to like this place, but with their very limited menu and prices, expected a much better experience."}
{"text":"Fresh off a trip to Nashville, I was pumped to try the southern cooking promised by Julep. The menu is organized by \"snacks\", small plates and large plates. We tried 2/5 in each category.  Snacks- pimento goat cheese was good. The cheese came with mildly cheesy crackers. A knife was needed BC the crackers crumbled with a dipping attempt. A-. The cornbread was buttery, fresh and delish. A.  Small plates- Nashville salad had fried pigs ears, lettuce and hot sauce. The weakest dish of the night. D. Blue crab rice cake. Rice, crab and scallions with a briney slaw. B.  Large plates. Fried chicken with collard greens. Mediocre, C. The greens were too sweet.  The best dish of the night was the Perlou. Rice grits, whitefish, andouille sausage. I would come back for that alone. A+.  Overall a solid B with possibilities."}
{"text":"We made a reservation by phone for a table for 7 people at 6:00 pm.  Upon arrival, the host stated that they had no record of it.  We had to wait for about 10 minutes, while staff rearranged tables to seat our party.  When our drink order was taken, everyone received their drinks except me.  I had ordered coffee, and it didn't arrive for more than 15 minutes.  Later, I ordered a refill after dinner, and it didn't arrive for another 15 minutes, and this time, it was cold.  Apparently, they order each cup from AOK Coffee at least 50 feet away from the restaurant.  While the food is excellent, the coffee system is beyond rediculous!  I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Dining out with an infant can be dicey, but the folks at Julep made it a breeze. They allowed us to make a reservation, even though we were one person short of their 6-person minimum; they had a high chair ready at our table without us having to ask; the server was super sweet and interactive with our 9-month-old daughter; they brought our food promptly even though they were super busy; and the noise level in the restaurant was high enough that her occasional shrieks didn't appear to bother any of the the other diners.  The food itself was great. The farro risotto was amazing -- as a vegetarian, I really appreciate chefs taking the time to make our dishes special, too."}
{"text":"Crap. $18 for fried chicken thighs, ham hock & collard greens? Really? Are we at Navy Pier (tourist trap with overpriced food for those who don't know). I've had an incredibly excellent combination of the same for far less. What a joke! Don't get me started on the pathetic pulled pork slider ($8). The potato chips (all six of em') tasted like oil & stale. Speaking of stale, how about the slider bun? Truly, this thing was stale. If it wasn't, then it must have been toasted & sat around for two hours. The pulled pork was, how you say, pedestrian? That's being nice. The first taste of pulled pork brought me back to high school - the cafeteria specifically. It was also room temperature. There was a very teeny-tiny cup of flavorless coleslaw & a deviled egg. The egg was actually the best part of this dish, but let's be real here, a deviled egg is nothing special - not anymore than any other deviled egg I've ever had. What a disappointment. I give this place maybe 2 years & gone. I will hand it to the chef though, as perhaps he is the first person to take the soul out of soul food."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago we took a friend to dinner at Julep for her birthday. We sat on the patio/courtyard near the stone wall in the back. I had noticed an odor immediately upon being seated but said nothing because of the occasion. Well, after dinner I walked back through the opening in the rock wall to confirm my suspicion and indeed the restaurant's dumpsters are stored on the other side. I thought of saying something to the hostess at the time, but didn't.  Instead I took the time to write a letter, a real letter, to the owners alerting them to the problem. I wrote in the interest of the success of the restaurant, not seeking anything in return. What is most shocking about this experience is that I received no reply at all, not a thank you for alerting them, nor an apology. As far as the food goes, it was just OK. None of us, including especially our friend whose birthday it was and is from Georgia, was especially pleased with our menu choices. Needless to say we won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I invited my nearest and dearest friends to join me for a birthday dinner at Julep this past  Saturday.  If I could give this place 6 stars, I would.  We ordered nearly everything on the menu and rave reviews were the result, all around the table.  Standouts: the Perlou- crispy rice and seafood so tasty that my boyfriend cleaned his plate even after he'd filled up on apps (I should mention that even for a large group, we were able to share most of the apps, which was great because we couldn't get enough of all the different flavors- oops, except the biscuits, pretty much everyone wanted to get their own- love at first bite)- the collard greens that came with the subtly spicy fried chicken- full of shaved fresh garlic and sweet/spicy with a silky vinegary finish, not your average bland collard greens- and the shrimp and grits, which were the best I've tasted in this city.  But I cannot stop thinking about the sweet potato pie- it's what sent me back here to write a new review- somehow managing to be light and fluffy yet sumptuously rich all at once.... mmmmm.... went perfectly with their bourbon milk punch!  Service at Julep is truly standout and must be mentioned.  Our server handled our table of 10+ graciously and efficiently, and there was no waiting for water, table clearing, fresh drinks, new utensils, etc. which is a feat for a huge table on a Saturday night.  The owner, Sarah, stopped by our table to chat at the end of the meal which was a lovely touch. After our meal was over,and we were all in a pleasant food coma, we realized nobody took any pictures of the exquisitely presented oysters or adorable vintage salt and pepper shakers or the bourbon chocolate cake in a julep cup running over with mint semifreddo- we were all enjoying our food too much- truly the highest praise in this day and age. All in all, Julep is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Last night was my third time to Julep (fourth to the Robinia trio overall) so I should probably write something positive. The design and atmosphere is THE BEST IN THE CITY, no contest. I'm not sure how it took this city so long to get it right, but... thank god for Julep, Borollo, and A-OK. We sat outside in the courtyard for dinner, which is just fantastic and is one of the few places where I feel like I could truly be in NYC or Portland or Miami. The cocktails and the food are great but what I love so much is the restaurants' sharing of space and menu. I had a mint julep from the bar at Julep and our dinner outside of fried chicken, mint pea salad, and blue crab cakes came from Julep, but we got a bottle of wine brought over from the experts at Borollo. The fried chicken was some of the best I've had in my entire life. So... I guess this city can do fried chicken now."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Julep and I was not disappointed.  I ordered the fried chicken thighs with collard greens.  The food was delicious, our server George (his first night) was great and what a beautiful space it is in.  I was with three other ladies and we all enjoyed the food and drinks.  I will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"HOLY COW! If you haven't been to Julep, get there fast! My husband and I decided to go there for a drink before heading to dinner elsewhere...well, we never left! The service is great, the bartenders are funny, and everyone is knowledgable and attentive. The restaurant has a nice \"spin\" on Kentucky fare, and as someone from Kentucky, I give it an A+! I would highly recommend the Mendoza, Mac and Cheese Gratin, and Sweet Potato Pie. The bartender even made pecancello that was our aperitif. Give this new restaurant a shot! It will amaze you!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute. Great date spot.  Let's start from the top.  My experience starts with a quick phonecall to Julep for a reservation. A lady answered and was awfully courteous and prompt with making this happen. I usually dont comment on this part but there was just something that impressed me by her style.  We entered from the front and first went past a coffee shop and bar to finally enter the restaurant. Our first impressions were very positive. The general look and decor of the restaurant could probably be summed up as modern, classy, cozy while remaining casual. The outdoor area is very well done as well and I was particularly impressed by the fact that while part of the seating has a direct view of east washington, there was no noise to pollute restaurant atmosphere. Depending on where you are seated, the restaurant could certainly lend it self to a nice one on one feeling to set the date mood.  A cool note is that after we ordered, hot sauce condiments and salt and pepper were placed on the table. We thought this was a fun touch.  Okay now to the food. We ordered a few things including, cornbread, biscuit, mac n cheese, shrimp and grits and fried chicken. We thought overall the food was very good. The breads were rich in flavor and buttery. We liked that the biscuit came with jam in addition to butter. The mac and cheese was interesting, it had a certain depth in that you could taste each cheese per time of ingestion. There seemed to be a fair amount of mustard flavor to it, however, and it was slightly overpowering. The fried chicken was very impressive as well with a crispy skin and perfectly cooked inside. The hamhock and collard greens that the chicken was served on was on point.  A couple notes on service. Overall it was great. A nice lady who we presumed was the owner came and inquired of our satisfactiom a few times. Our waiter was overall good but seemed spread and wasnt able to provide us with great service. Something that caught me off guard was that after we said we were finished our waiter took our hot sauces and salt and pepper shakers and put them directly on other peoples tables. I am sure it is common in the restaurant bussiness to move this around but it just seemed like maybe this isnt the best thing to allow patrons to see, given it can he interpreted in different ways.  Overall, Julep is great and I will be apart of the crowd who spreads the word. Great atmosphere, food, and service."}
{"text":"The cheesecake is amazing but the lack of authentic gravy and crazy heavy salty biscuits made it hard to feel like it was actually in the south... more an idea without execution"}
{"text":"This was so delicious. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken and was beyond impressed. It was the perfect crunch with all the flavor. The homemade pickles were a great touch. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food and service were good, and it helped that we were there on a snowy weeknight; when it's less busy it's easier to get a server's nearly undivided attention. One point of disappointment: The fresh-squeezed lemonade. Fresh-squeezed lemonade is very hard to find, least of all at a non-breakfast place, and because of that I specifically asked whether it was indeed freshly squeezed in-house (they said it was),  whether it was unsweetened (they said it was), and whether it was essentially lemon juice mixed with water (they said it was). Delighted, I ordered one. What arrived certainly didn't taste like fresh-squeezed lemonade. I asked again what was in it, because it tasted sweet to me, and they said it was fresh-squeezed lemonade with Country Time lemonade powder added to it (that's like ordering a glass of champagne and getting a champagne mixed with Sprite). It's sad that I wasn't told the truth before I ordered (and paid for) it, especially after the exhaustive number of questions I had asked. A little integrity goes a long way."}
{"text":"I've been here almost 2 years from Los Angeles. I co-own a high-end restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, so I've been struggling to find a place in Madison that combines good food, good service, and upscale ambience - big city style. Julep nailed it. It's the first place that I have even given a review to since being here. The fried chicken and collard greens were amazing. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"A lot to like about this place:  The julep was tasty although I think they go a bit overboard on the crushed ice. The food was very tasty (we had appetizers, the shrimp & grits, risotto, pot roast, and fried chicken as well as a couple of desserts). The ambience is nice, bright, airy - very pleasant.  My main gripe is the vast difference in portion size between the entrees. The fried chicken thighs ($18) only came with 1 thigh on a small bed of collard greens - 18 bucks, c'mon! Especially when it is listed on the menu as \"fried chicken thighs,\" plural.  The pot roast and risotto were large portions and the shrimp & grits was an ok size although 3 shrimp is a bit skimpy in my opinion.  The service was pretty slow as well. The drinks took forever. We ordered them first then ordered appetizers, and didn't get the drinks until we were 1/2 done with the apps.   A good place but they've got some things to work out before it will be great."}
{"text":"This laid-back Kentucky Derby themed joint is a magical addition to downtown.  Whether you are checking it out to have some drinks or to have a sitdown meal, you just can't go wrong.    The craft cocktails are very exceptional (a telltale sign of the perfect julep is crushed ice, and they don't disappoint) and the list is classy and perfected. I am more into wine, and I would have to admit they have a very competent wine list.    The food is delicious and pretty creative, combining classic southern recipes with a flare of Madison eccentricity.  I try to get something new every time I go, but the staples I would recommend is the cornbread (WOW!) and crabcakes.  I am a huge fan of anywhere that offers small plates, both because I tend to have an \"eyes are bigger than my stomach\" appetite and also I love to expand my horizons and try many things instead of just one; they do not disappoint on their small plate options.  The fried chicken: Oh myyyyyy yummmy!    OH And did I mention their super awesome patio!? I'm almost hesitant to give that little gem away for fear that all of you will steal my new favorite restaurant patio!   Moral of the story?  DO IT."}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits - pretty good, although the fact that we only got three shrimp was disappointing.  The shrimp had really good flavor though.   Perlou - also pretty good. Smoked whitefish is always good. Unfortunately the oysters tasted too much like algae for my taste.  Black eyed pea salad - the highlight of the meal. A unique and intriguing potpourri of flavors. Very tasty.   Apple cobbler - very good. The lemon and apple work well together. The maple cream doesn't really improve the experience though.   Chocolate cake - a bit disappointing. Cake was not \"chocolatey\" enough. Mint ice cream on top was pretty good."}
{"text":"I dined here with a couple of my friends. I was super excited to have some southern food as I have not been impressed with any other place in town.  For a drink, I ordered the Bourbon Sweet Tea. I thought it lacked flavor, would not order that again. For my main dish, I got the shrimp and grits. It was VERY good. The grits were cooked perfectly. The other two I was dining with ordered something different so we could try all the dishes. One ordered the Fried Chicken and Greens, and the other ordered the Perlou. The Fried Chicken and Greens were good. I enjoyed the greens. The bite of fried chicken I had was a little too breaded for my liking.  The Perlou was very tasty - would not recommend if you don't like spicy as it does have a kick.  We ordered corn bread for an appetizer, and it was VERY good.  Overall it was a pleasant dining experience. I felt that there prices were a little high."}
{"text":"We've been to Julep twice now and both visits were great.  I love what they've done with the space most of all, which is a wonderful and artistic reuse of many reclaimed pieces such as lathe, which beautifully covers an entire wall, a fantastic antique bedframe hung on another wall, and incredible vintage light fixtures throughout.  I can't wait to eat there this summer so we can sit in what looks like a terrific outdoor courtyard.    Now on to the food. The first time we went I had to order their signature drink, a mint julep. It was my first one and I don't know if all juleps are as potent as this one, but it really packed a punch.  They also have a nice wide range of other cocktails, cordials, and specialty drinks.  \"Snacks\" and \"Little Plates\" are priced so you can try several and that we did.  On our first visit we ordered the Cast Iron Cornbread (I've never eaten corn bread so moist and flavorful) and Pimento Cheese (charred onion, pecans, crackers). The latter was good but not a standout. From the little plate category, we had the Blue Crab Jasmine Rice Cake, the Field Pea Salad, and the Mississippi Delta Tamales which were intriguing for their chocolate mole sauce. None of these was particularly special either.  For our entrees, I had the Brisket Pot Roast with root vegetables and potato purée on both visits and I don't know if I'll ever order anything else.  The roast is fall-apart tender and very rich combined with the root veggies and potatoes, all covered in a dark gravy.  My husband ordered the Charleston Shrimp & Grits and he liked it well enough.    The service is good and we got a table pretty quickly in spite of how busy the restaurant was. It's wonderful to have another great restaurant in this area of the city."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner once on a Friday night. Their food is really good if you plan on sharing, so you can order several things and try them all. We ordered the chicken liver mousse, the crab cakes, the corn bread and the grits. The chicken liver mousse was fantastic, and paired well with the pickled onions that came on the side to help cut the richness of the mousse. Could have probably came with more bread though. The crab cakes were nice and big and mainly crab. The corn bread was nice and fluffy. The grits had more of a modern twist than your traditional grits, it was not creamy or cheesy. The texture to me was more fried rice than grits. But still very good. I got a mint julep to drink, how could I order anything else? Oh wow...it was STRONG! But once I gave the ice a chance to melt and dilute the drink down, it was really good. Will definitely be back to Julep to check out the rest of the menu some time."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. First - enter from East Washington. The place is at the end of the hallway.   Interesting fact, I believe that Julep, A-OK, and the wine bar actually all share the same kitchen, which is an independent LLC. Cool idea.   Now, the food. Julep is a high-artistry take on southern cuisine, a d they kill it. I had the cast-iron cornbread appetizer, a drink their strip and grits Entree. Both were amazing.   I saw them making the cornbread as I walked past the kitchen, and the do use little cast iron skillets. The cornbread was light a it's crust was slightly caramelized and I think the butter they serve is made in house, and is excellent. Enough for two to split.   The shrimp and grits were out of this world. Three large strip, spicy but not oppressive. Julienned peppers and onions sautéed in the cream sauce, a d the best Godin grits I've had outside of the South. Filling, surprising, and delicious.  Dessert was a bourbon cake served with mint Icecream. What more could you want?   Cocktails are also dynamite here. \"In Your Head\" is light and fruity with a refreshing zing, and a gin punch to your mind. The \"Pecan Milk Punch\" was creamy and had warm flavors with nutmeg and their homemade Pecan-cello.   Pricepoint is a little higher here - splitting the bill down the middle with a friend, pre tip was $46.00. This covers half the appetizer, my entree, two cocktails and half of the bourbon cake.   Atmosphere is comfortable - don't come in your sweats if you don't want to feel out of place, but I don't think they'd turn you away. Xi think this place is in a reclaimed car shop, a d they kept a lot of the architecture in place - large carport door, exposed ceilings, lots of brick -  but classed it all up. I ate right next to the carport door and had zero issues with it. Also, they seem to have a large outdoor space they used for NYE, and will likely be an excellent beer garden in the warmer months."}
{"text":"Now I have happily experienced Julep six times.  Most recently for their brunch on Sunday.  What I love about Julep is that you don't feel rushed. You can take your time and enjoy the experience.  On my most recent visit, with three family members, we started with two of their scrumptious biscuits with maple butter and a blueberry jam....much like a compote.  The warm biscuits we're crunchy on the outside and moist and crumbly on the inside.  We then ordered our main courses...shrimp and grits, biscuits and gravy, quiche, and corned beef, hash browns and eggs.  Portions were plentiful.  We finished our meal with great coffee and strawberry rhubarb coffeecake that was served with a mint semifreddo which is so creamy and delectable.  So another great dining experience.  Thank you Julep!"}
{"text":"As far as i know, this is really only place in Madison yiu can get Southern-inspired food. The cornbread was amazing and the fried chicken thigh large plate was very good. The cocktail list was different and everything I tried was really good"}
{"text":"Julep is a new fusion/southern spot on E Washington, along with a couple other new spots.   It's in a nice hallway-like venue with A-OK and Barolo. So it's pretty awesome if there is a wait since you can just pop into these business next door and even bring your drink with you when your table is ready!  The setup is not what you would normally expect with what comes with a southern diner (this is not a diner but a hip yet homely atmosphere).   The drinks list is very well executed, with a wide choice of Bourbon and other spirits (port/sherry, etc). Very good southern-inspired cocktails as well. I tried the house julep with Rose Bourbon, mint and it was wonderful.   The small plates and appetizers menu has very interesting/alternative choices. We tried the grilled oysters and pimento cheese which are nicely done with a lot of character. Tried the pot roast entrée, it's tender and juicy.  Definitely coming back to try the other dishes on the menu!"}
{"text":"Given that I'm from Kentucky, having a place in Madison that serves southern fare is a great new addition to our food scene. They have mint juleps of course--to good old fried chicken and collard greens. Then there's the huge list of KY bourbon and whisky, which is fantastic as well. I loved all of our dishes and the look of the bar especially. The small Kentucky signs and maps made me feel at home. Thank you! The outside dining area was very cool. Highly recommend the place. One bummer is they don't have Hot Brown on the menu..."}
{"text":"Food was ok, drinks were good, but when I ordered a Mint Julep I was only poured about a third of a drink. Not like, \"less than a full drink to allow the ice to melt\", but a solid two or three sips worth. When I brought it up to my waitress she assured me \"that's how we pour 'em\", despite the fact that my three friends were later poured FULL glasses. Drink wasn't comped, wasn't offered an apology. Poorly handled. The two sips of julep were pretty good though."}
{"text":"Madison is hugely lacking in southern dining options and Julep is certainly a nice addition to the restaurant options. The black eyed pea salad was a standout during my first visit to Julep but I found the grits disappointing and lacking in flavor. The service was a bit sporadic and we never had our water refilled throughout the meal. Also, we waited 1.5 hours for a table on a Friday night and were only seated when we approached the hostess who had just sat a table of 5 after us on the wait list. The bar looked like a great place to grab a drink but I may not return for dinner in the near future to let them work through the menu and service a bit more."}
{"text":"Mmm the food was great! I really enjoyed the oysters and The Mac and cheese. But the pot roast was melt in your mouth amazing. Can't wait to come back:)"}
{"text":"The space is lovely and so was the service. Interesting glass light fixtures. Beautiful courtyard. Reclaimed wood maybe. Welcome to new America.   I like my cocktails with at least two kinds of amaro, some bitters, and a syrup. I wasn't let down. But hey there's always room for improvement! Make a show of burning some orange oil like a flame thrower over my glass next time!  The dinner menu is short, so for me it was quickly whittled down to brisket. It was dece and there was a lot of it. I prefer my meat to be extremely tender and fall apart to the touch and I had to chew this more than I like. The potatoes and root vegetables had great flavor and texture. The whole business was wading in a pool of gravy, which was savory and rich. I could have licked the plate clean of it.  For dessert... you know what, I don't really enjoy cake. What was I thinking? Oh well. It was fine. But it was still cake, ya know? You'll like it if you like lots of cake and ice cream, which you probably do."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Julep, it is my favorite restaurant in Madison at the moment. After dinner there with a friend, I was quick to recommend it to my friends and coworkers. The fried chicken is very good. Crispy, tasty skin, with flavorful, moist thigh boneless meat- this combination is hard to come by. The shrimp and grits were delicious too- large shrimp cooked just right, and the grits were creamy and well-seasoned. I wasn't a big fan of the peppers in this dish, but it didn't detract from the dish. The shrimp fritters were unexpected, I was expecting whole shrimp but it was more like a shrimp paste.. I enjoyed it though, as well as the okra that came with this appetizer. My friend had a few cocktails and was happy with the quality of them. I also appreciated the ambience and decor of the restaurant.. the salt and pepper shakers are adorable and what an interesting idea to hang the antique headboard on the wall. Overall, Julep gets 5 stars because the service, ambience, decor, food, drinks, and location are all very good."}
{"text":"How adorable! The atmosphere is intimate and cozy. Julep is situated in a little burrow with Barolo Wine Bar and A OK Cafe. All three establishments look clean, inviting, and interesting. :)   Went to Julep with a very large group (we called to make a reservation) and received excellent service. The servers were friendly and attentive without being overbearing.   The the cocktails were good, stiff drinks. I ordered the house Julep and was impressed by the strong but smooth bourbon flavor.   The snacks: The biscuit with butter and jam was a game-changer. Very delicious, I will be returning if not just for these little nuggets of heaven. The pimento goat cheese with crackers and corn bread were also a crowd favorites.   The small plates: The Mac n' cheese was great, as was the blue crab jasmine rice cake.   Large plates: The perlou and the Farro Risotto were absolutely delicious.  The food was delicious and satisfying but the portions were not overly large. Most people cleaned their plates completely and did not take home leftovers (we ordered lots of starters and also dinner for each of us).   Julep is a new favorite of mine! I will definitely be returning for dinner and/or cocktails."}
{"text":"As an expatriate southerner, I'm always happy to discover a new place that features the tastes of home. My wife and I had a fabulous dinner here on Friday. It was busy, and we expected to wait for a table, but we were seated immediately. Our service by Amanda was excellent and the cocktails were dangerously delicious (and strong!).  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We visited last month.  I had the barley risotto, my husband had the shrimp and grits and we shared pork tamales.  Everything was delicious.  The grits were out of this world!  I would eat just a plate of that!  The julep tea (non-alcoholic) was really good too.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This little cluster of restaurants is definitely welcome on the once desolate-after-6pm stretch of E Washington. The décor is clean and appealing and they nailed the outdoor patio (see you next year!).  Southern cuisine is something that has been woefully represented in Madison, so it's nice to see Julep get in the scene. I'm happy with the size of the menu - very manageable and organized well. We started with the grilled oysters, brought to the table on a smoldering pile of wood chips. Good flavor; I'd just suggest a bit more smokiness.  The mains exceeded expectations - if you knocked me out, blindfolded me and told me we were eating in South Carolina, I'd believe you. The Shrimp & Grits was a medium-sized portion with three large shrimp and a tasty gravy. The Perlou stole the show with the tasty crisped rice (think: sothern bibimbap) with undertones of a nice smoky whitefish flavor. You're probably wondering about the Juleps - they are solid, just a lot of crushed ice."}
{"text":"First time at Julie, Excellent food, beautiful venue and attentive staff.  The shrimp and grits, and fried chicken were delicious, along with great house cocktails."}
{"text":"Where there with friends and we shared a number of the dishes on the menu.  We started out with the terrine, the cornbread and the pimento cheese. Terrine was distinctly smocked and served with a sweet, grainy mustard, salty, pickled green beans and toasted bread. Very good. The cornbread was amazing. Not sure what they did to it, but it was sweet, crispy, chewy, moist and perfectly caramelized on the outside. Basically it hit every note: highly recommended! Pimento cheese was a bit meh. Nothing special.  Then we had the fried chicken, the pot roast and the perlou. All was good, but the chicken was the star! It was so good we ordered a second round. And not only was the chicken good, but the collards it came with were amazing too: tender and sweet, with some smokiness from the ham. Perlou was spicy and crunchy, but really you could not tell there was fish in there. Good in a drunk food kind of way. Pot roast was very tender and well flavored.  We rounded off the meal with the sweet potato pie. Not too sweet, rich, creamy and with a perfectly crunchy crust. Better than expected.  For drinks I had a julep. Strong, but I enjoyed it.  Now let's get to service. Way too fast! The waitress was always trying to took away our dishes before we were done. We commented on that several times and made a joke of trying to shield our food. We were not very successful. Now I appreciate prompt service as much as the next person, but there is a point at which prompt becomes rushed and you start feeling like they are trying to turn tables as quickly as possible and get us out of their way. That is exactly how we felt. As a comeback we stayed and chatted as long as possible!"}
{"text":"I try to reserve my 5 star ratings for places I would go the very next day and eat again, and Julep makes the grade.  There were 7 of us that ventured out on a Saturday night and I use one word to describe the meal: DELISH!  Everyone was super happy with the meal, the craft cocktails, the ambiance, just everything about this place.  Their fried chicken was simply amazing.  The appetizers were amazing too.  Do not waste any time getting over to Julep."}
{"text":"Some friends recommended this as the newest place to be, so we went at 7ish on a Friday, and oh man. That wait! Luckily we could just go to the wine bar next door, Barolo, and have a glass or two first.  The food was good! I really like the grilled oysters, liked the chicken liver pate, and quite enjoyed the cornbread.  Weirdest and most delicious thing: the Perlou. I really wasn't sure what to expect with the oysters in there, but it was a surprisingly refreshing little salty nip in with the other elements!  Overall: I would definitely go back, and I had a good time, but I don't think it's a place I would crave on the reg. I think I would try the fried chicken next time (looked awesommmeee) and potentially save some room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Black-eyes pea salad- 5 stars Cast-iron cornbread- 5 stars Grilled oysters- 5 stars Shrimp & grits- 4 stars (but I suspect shrimp & grits just isn't my thing) Apple pie dessert- 4.5 (only because it had a hint of nutmeg or something I don't care for)- looking forward to trying the bourbon chocolate cake next!  Also, the coffee is amazing!  Great vibe! Love this place."}
{"text":"To start was a really nice setting and I was very pleased with the look of the house Julep drink which I ordered from the bar. Was well made and served quickly. We sat, however, and when we weren't ready to order in the first two minutes were waiting for about 15 minutes until we grabbed a waiters attention to place our orders for drinks and starters. Waited another 10 minutes for our server to show up with drinks.  The menu looked interesting and we found some things we were not expecting. Mole tamales, fried chicken, shrimp and grits. The prices however were not commensurate with the product. $6 for cast iron skillet corn bread and it was okay. Not great, not bad, but for $6 we expected something more.   The rest of the food we got was more of the same, okay, but nothing special and more than we would spend. If everything was 20%-30% cheaper this place could maybe get three stars. The tamale, however, is worth noting was horrible. The mole was nothing like mole's I have had in Mexico, and the creative license taken is not welcome. In short, Julep is not worth the money, particularly with cheaper tastier options within blocks."}
{"text":"This is a gourmet soul food restaurant. Don't go hungry. Presentation is awesome, food not so much"}
{"text":"You cannot beat the atmosphere of this place. Their outdoor seating is beautiful and thoughtful. I had their seasonal risotto which had mushrooms, corn, squash, etc. and it was phenomenal. They also have a large cocktail menu. I will for sure be back here to try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Favorite Brunch place in Madison. I am biased being from the South. Seriously a really great brunch that seems to be a hidden gem on East Washington. I have yet to have the pleasure of eating here for dinner, however been here for brunch at least ten times so far. Hash browns are great, Kentucky Sunrise is a great drink. My favorite is the shrimp and grits, however the table favorite is biscuits and gravy. Atmosphere is great. We sometimes have friends with small kids, no issues. On beautiful days the outside patio area is just amazing. Recommended this place to everyone."}
{"text":"We read about Julep recently and my husband was looking for some good fried chicken so we went on the early side on Saturday night and sat at the bar.  The decor was simple and warm.  It looks like they are going to have a really nice patio in the summer!  We started with pimiento cheese and oysters and both were very good.  For entrees we had the fried chicken thighs which were very good (he said a bit on the crispy side) and I had a special of chicken and dumplings which was fantastic.  The rue had a lemony dill flavor that complimented the chicken, celery, and carrots so well.  It was a simple dish with excellent nuances. The texture and size of the dumplings were perfect.  And all for $15.  For dessert, we had the sweet potato pie with a hint of cayenne and it was outstanding- the crust was delicious.    We didn't have any drinks but hope to sample a few next time as we'll definitely be back.  This is one of the better dining experiences we've had since moving to Madison.  Great job, Julep!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We are here on a whim one night and everyone loved their entrees. I recommend the pork chops for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to Julep 12-15 times and it's always exceptional!  The corn bread is delicious, the oysters are excellent, and the Mac N cheese is so good my of of town customer keeps asking me to steal the recipe."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with southern decor. The mint Julep's are to die for. Great restaurant for appetizers and a nice glass of wine or a full dinner. The courtyard is delightful, very relaxing, and perfect for dinner or conversation."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Madison. The mac and cheese is great (and perfectly portioned). But my love for this place really stems from the biscuits. They are amazing--I cannot recommend them enough!"}
{"text":"The hostess was inattentive and working on the computer while we stood there waiting to be seated, restaurant was almost empty so no reason to wait. The apps were very good, the pimento cheese was a highlight. As far as the main dishes went the fried chicken was good. But the grits in the shrimp and grits were undercooked and the pot roast was overcooked. Overall, food was okay, but not worth the price. Too many good restaurants in Madison to go back."}
{"text":"When I was younger, I lived a spell in Georgia, and a part of me still sees Southern food as comfort food. Not only because it brings back memories of childhood but also because Southern food is always filling and comforting, with its generous helpings of butter, meat, and flavor. So when I found out about Julep, I had to give it a try. After all, I wondered how one does upscale Southern food.  This establishment is fairly small, part of a troika of food establishments (along with Barolo and A-OK) wedged into a small building in the Willy Street neighborhood. The menu was not the largest, but it seemed to focus on the Southern food of the Eastern seaboard - influences of Virginia down to South Carolina with its confluence of seafood and meats. For starters I ordered a crab cake with pickled potato shreds, and for entree I was recommended the shrimp and grits. I also got a spiked sweet tea and a side of cornbread.  In hindsight, I've come to the conclusion that hip(ster) and Southern don't mix. The soul of Southern food is unpretentious comfort, with its wholesome ingredients cooked simply and not obsessing over small details or undue complexity. Not to say that Southern food isn't laborious - the labor is totally dedicated to making the food as delicious and fulfilling as possible. So when Julep tries to up the ante in terms of culinary finesse, and then tries to maintain its hip credentials with refurbished wood, old-timey lightbulbs, and lumbersexual aesthetic, the result is a clash of values. The crab cakes, although made with real crab, had more potato in it than actual crab. Furthermore, the picked potato makes no sense next to the crab cake (yes, singular cake). The vegetables in the shrimp and grits were cooked separately and not enough, and as a result there really wasn't a mingling of flavor between the shrimp, grits, and vegetables. Also, my grits had a huge lump in the middle. Finally, their spiked sweet tea was not sweet even by normal American standards, let alone the very sweet sweet teas of the South. In their defense, the shrimp was well-grilled and seasoned, and the cornbread was really good (I think it's a cast iron cornbread recipe which gave it a really crunchy crust that was really good).   But this meal was ultimately disappointing because you can't be hip and ironic while at the same time be true to a Southern mentality. If you want to do fancier Southern dining, you can put more attention into, say, the sourcing of the food or the technique for ensuring a quality product (like Boston's Hungry Mother), but ultimately you have to be unironically warming their hearts with comfort food. Compare that to, say, New Orleans Take-out, which on the outside looks like a derelict soup kitchen but the food inside is wholesome and delicious. I don't recommend coming here for Southern food because it's not real Southern food. It masquerades as Southern food but lacks the comfort that is the heart and soul of Dixie."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and ambiance! We sat outside, and it was absolutely perfect. They have heaters outside for the colder weather, which is great. The biscuits and fig jam is to die for!!! Best biscuit I've ever had. I had to get an extra to take home with me for breakfast.   My boyfriend ordered the brisket pot roast, which had great flavor and laid in delicious mashed potatoes. The fried chicken and collard greens are good, but the breaking was a little spicy for my taste. I prefer breast/white meat over chicken thigh/dark meat for fried chicken, but it was still certainly better and more authentically Southern than anywhere else in Madison. The mint juleps are great! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner but I went for brunch for the first time today and it did not disappoint! Great southern classics that were very tasty. We had the shrimp and grits, blueberry banana muffin, and Nashville hot chicken.   Shrimp and grits were so flavorful! Would have been nice to have a few more shrimp since their were only 3 but overall very good!   The hot chicken was good, but not too hot! And the muffin was super moist and delicious.   The other thing that really made this brunch was the outdoor courtyard. They have a beautiful courtyard that was perfect for this first warm weekend of the year!"}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place. Having lived in the South, I am always searching for the comfort food I have come to love. My partner and I arrived on a Friday night, without a reservation, at 8:00pm to a half-full restaurant. It took a significant amount of time to even get the attention of a host to put our name down. Host explains some tables are turning over and that we will be seated soon.   We grab drinks at the bar, and continue to see tables emptying and left uncleared. 40 minutes later we check in with the host stand, and are told the same: turning tables and will be seated soon. Another 15 minutes and we are finally seated. 55 minutes of staring at empty tables while we waited. The rest of the experience was fine, the food we ordered (Farro Risotto, Mac & Cheese) was fine - nothing mind blowing. The service was very slow and lackluster.  The space is about the same as any new/trendy space coming into Madison. I hope to check out the courtyard in the summer, but have zero intention of returning for any other purpose.  While I have understanding for the logistics of restaurant operations, Friday nights should be staffed at full capacity especially for a brand new, highly anticipated spot. At the very least, the communication between guests and staff could be improved."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! It is easy to get to, but tucked out of he way a bit, so it wasn't packed even though we went the night of the UW Homecoming. The atmosphere was spectacular - cozy and romantic. We each had the Julep which comes served over shaved ice. It was delicious! Both our meals were great too. I had the Perlou, which someone had previously described as \"southern bibimbap\" and they were dead on. My boyfriend had the shrimp and grits, which had the perfect amount of spice to it. We both left stuffed! The pricing is pretty on par with some of the trendier restaurants in Madison. The only down side is that parking is tough, especially with all the construction on nearby streets. We can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Julep is the jewel in the 3 pronged crown of the Robina courtyard. Along with the great wine bar Barolo and coffee shop A-ok make it a destination spot you can hang out at all night and move between.  Dinner! The CORN BREAD is stab your friends hand with a fork if they try to take the last piece good. Fried chicken and collared greens are the better then places I've had in the south. Shrimp and grits here completely changed my mind on how I felt about grits. Awesome.   Can't wait for the summer to chill in the courtyard."}
{"text":"Meh.  The good:  The drinks.  Both were superb.  A gin and grapefruit juice concoction...boy howdy would that be good on a Summer day..But good as the snow flies too.  The rye drink (RyDy) with sorghum and ginger...also stellar (word of caution:  the two don't go well together ;) )  The cornbread appetizer was great, maybe not enough for the price, but crispy top and bottom with a hint of sweetness.  Left me wanting more.  The needs improvement:   The wife had catfish.  A slab of fried fish on a big white plate with two meager tablespoons of coleslaw and four hush puppies.  It looked unappealing.  I liked the hush puppies, the wife was lukewarm to them, and the fish had not much flavor, although cooked well.  The bordering on laughably bad:  The oyster appetizer that came on a bed of wood chips (borrowed from a nearby playground?). AND THEY WERE ON FIRE!  I felt like blowing on them to see if the smolder would ignite more and set off the smoke detectors.  Seriously, who serves something on smoky smoldering wood chips??  Not an appealing presentation.  The waiter took our drinks away without asking if we were finished.  (No, we weren't).  Idiot.  Waiter also proclaimed something we ordered as \"My favorite\". (Like I care). I want the wait staff to be better trained.  Pie crust?  Super tough.  Someone overworked the dough.  We stopped at Trader Joes on the way home to get food.  Says something."}
{"text":"Great southern food. Cornbread cooked like it should be. Brisket was fantastic, brussel sprout squash risotto was perfect. Drinks super tasty.   On a weekend night the line can be a bit longer, but with the wine bar next door the wait goes by in no time!"}
{"text":"Im visiting family and my sister wanted me to try this place. I was very pleased. We got a biscuit and it was buttery and flaky however $4 for 1 biscuit is a bit steep I think. Then I got the perlou and sister got the special of the day which was catfish fish fry. My perlou was really good. It had great flavor qnd texture of crispy rice was soo good. The fish fry was hot and crispy and pretty darn good.  The service was good and the ambiance is really nice. Will head back when Im in town."}
{"text":"The Julep is a great place to check out some craft cocktails. Very classy and casual place to get a great tasting julep. It is VERY hard to limit yourself to just one. Fun to sit at the bar and watch the bartender do their thing. Way better to hang out in the Robinia Courtyard!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite new restaurant in Madison. The space is trendy without being pretentious. I love the decor. The staff were friendly and the service was quick. I went with the shrimp and grits which were flavorful and filling. Big prawns smothered in a pork gravy. Authentic southern cooking. I recommend the mint julep made with four roses. I didn't have a chance to sit at the bar, but next time for sure. Just wish they were open during lunch. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This brand new pop up may need a few more menu items. The atmosphere is cute, comfortable, great for catching up with friends. The crab cake medium plate was absolutely on point delicious. Highly recommend, good flavored. But as for the main course, there just aren't many options.. Finally settled on the farro risotto, which I should have known what I was getting into, farro is a grittier & bigger grain. Not that great. Friend got the fried chicken and she licked the plate! I would recommend this place for the atmosphere and small plates."}
{"text":"Gorgeous space, the service was fair, the food was shockingly bad.  Of my family of four, all of us thought the cornbread too salty and unremarkable.  All of our entrees were below average, the fried chicken was flavorless and the collard greens were weirdly sweet, greasy and oversalted.  The risotto was unremarkable.  Overpriced.  The staff seemed edgy.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Overall a great place to check out. Ambience is good for more intimate settings and parties as large as 6 or so people. Waitstaff is friendly and professional.  Food is pretty good too. Had the shrimp fritters, which were decent... Texture was a bit strange being bready with bits of slimy okra. Mac and cheese was amazing. I would eat it again and again. Field pea salad was very delicious as well and a very large portion size. Would definitely suffice as a meal in itself. The farro risotto was pretty okay. I might have just been really full from already eating the previous items, so wasn't so excited about this. Random sweetness of apples were interesting.   I would come here again for sure and try their other items... and for more mac and cheese."}
{"text":"If there was a possibility  to rate this restaurant 0 stars  I would. First I would like you to know me and my boyfriend came here for the first time on a romantic date we ordered 2 orders of the Mac n cheese, cornbread, and the collard greens with hammock and fried chicken. The prices were reasonable but the lack of taste and preparation of the food was ridiculous. The mac n cheese had absolutely no flavor, the collard greens taste like a pile of sugar, cornbread was hard as a rock and again no flavor, and the chicken wasn't Evan fried more like over baked with no flavor. We actually sent almost everything back to the kitchen and choose not to eat it. Me and my boyfriend are from the south and both agreed this restaurant was a Terrible representation of southern food. Highly disappointed in the service we received as well definitely will not return and tell others not to aswell."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed foodie who has enjoyed ten years of Chicago dining and culture, I have largely been underwhelmed with what Madison has to offer a transplant. Thankfully Julep has restored my faith.   The decor and ambiance indicates that the owners are mindful of a world beyond Southern Wisconsin (how refreshing). It's a curated experience that marries modernity, charm and approachability. It's an atmosphere that has energy but without the excessive din, the dining room is romantic but not a chick flick cliche.  Now about the food. While a modern take on southern favorites isn't a new concept, it's a welcome addition to the Madison dining scene. The flavors feel rooted in authentic recipes with new ingredients and small surprises that would bring a smile to any diner's face.   We started with the pimento cheese and homemade crackers as wells as the fried shrimp and okra. Both were flavorful, well seasoned and surprisingly light. Mint Juleps and Dark and Stormy's were ordered and very well made.  Fried chicken boneless thighs, shrimp and grits and perlou were ordered with a side of Mac n Cheese. Each of the entrees had individual moments of surprise and delight. The fried chicken was outstanding. The perlou had bite after bite of heart warming flavor. The shrimp and grits were solid although heavy-handed with gravy (unfortunately, the roux needed more salt too). Lastly, the Mac n Cheese was the runaway crowd favorite that stole the spotlight from the main actors, but a strong showing by all regardless.   The lemon curd pie with buttermilk crust was the final act that sealed the deal. We were in love with Julep and wanted more.   Definitely make the trip to Julep. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Madison's loudest restaurant?  If it isn't, it's certainly in the running.  A Thursday night, with a few tables and a bar crowd made for impossible conversation. I couldn't hear the person sitting next to me.  Service was good, the food was ok (be prepared for small portions), and the setting was nice.  It's nothing I'll make a trip to enjoy again."}
{"text":"Finally made it in to try Julep and our first time was great.  I love what they've done with the interior, and the three businesses sharing the space really work together.  All of the staff were phenomenally helpful and friendly - they really set the mood for a great night from the moment we walked in.    Started with the case iron corn bread, which was served warm and fresh with a nice whipped butter.  The menu description says it comes with raw honey, which I didn't see - maybe it was incorporated into the butter but if so not in any discernible quantity.  The cocktails we had were both hits, well done on the bar menu.  Everything on the menu sounded so good that we decided to split a variety of dishes. The blue corn crab cakes were my dining companion's favorite and my least favorite - although I still thought they were quite good there was just so much good food.  A bit heavy on the corn bread and lighter on the crab was the only downside to these, but the flavors were spot on.  The field pea salad, which was recommended by our waiter is big enough to split between 3-4 people and just delicious, which fluffy clouds of goat cheese tossed throughout and perfectly complemented by the smoked tomato vinaigrette.  Our last small dish was the fried green tomatoes - the tomatoes came out light and crispy, and the accompanying salad was perfection with candied pecans.    The Charleston shrimp and grits featured large juicy shrimp over fluffy grits all covered in a tasty ham gravy.   A great comfort meal, reminiscent of biscuits and gravy.  We finished off the meal with a slice of buttermilk pie with lemon curd - which featured a nice heavy custard weaved through with not-too-tart-not-too-sweet lemon curd.  Overall a delightful meal, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant on Friday night. I had the shrimp and grits and my husband had the catfish. We shared the risotto with squash and Brussel sprouts as our side(it was an entree so it was an expensive side). My husband said the catfish was good. I was excited for the shrimp and grits but it was just okay. It was a cream sauce and not what I was expecting. The risotto was chewy but tasted okay. My husband did have some collard greens that were really good. We had the chocolate cake with mint ice cream for dessert. The ice cream was good but the cake was dry. The setting is beautiful. May try again in the summer so we can sit out by the stone patio."}
{"text":"Wonderful drinks and dinner with my partner.  We started with a bottle of wine in the courtyard ( mid November, so thank you propane heaters) and dined in Julep with appetizers of cornbread and pimento goat cheese, then the perlou and chicken.  Phenomenal! Highly recommend this for late afternoon cocktails and or diner."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was unexpectedly nice and the beer garden vibe of the large outdoor seating area is a great plus. I went for brunch and ordered a cappuccino (very well done) a doughnut (delicious) corned beef hash (got what I paid for) and a Bloody Mary"}
{"text":"Dined at the outside courtyard on a warm fall evening. Folky band was a perfect accompaniment for the setting and food. Reasonable tap selection. Service was attentive but not intrusive. Kept water glasses full and answered menu questions with ease. The biscuit was large, delicate inside but crispy outside and a delightful balance of sweet and buttermilky. The field pea salad was delicious--smoky bacon dressing with lots of farmer cheese, kale, and peas. Was hearty but not heavy. Rewarded my lighter meal with buttermilk pie topped with lemon curd. Was a bit bland and crust was heavy. The curd was thin and rather limited. Bathrooms were clean and nicely decorated. Some signage directing patrons where to enter and where to sit would help with multiple establishments using same space."}
{"text":"I don't mind spending more when the food is exceptionally good but the prices here just don't match the food quality. We were there on a Sunday night and maybe the regular Chef was off, I hope so.The Farro Risotto was exquisite and the highlight of the evening but a small portion for $17. The pork dish was so ordinary and not that tasty. The Cast Iron Cornbread was so blah and a small portion for $6! We splurged on a dessert and regretted that move. It was some kind of Blueberry cobbler and unfortunately we could taste the additives which gave us the impression the fruit came out of a can. Needless to say the dinner didn't end on a good note with that one and the bill didn't help. I doubt we would ever try it again.I had such high hopes for this place since we live close by!"}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place and came in with high hopes, but was disappointed.  The outdoor dining space is lovely and the service is really nice.  But I didn't think much of the food.  The cornbread, which we shared at the table, was weirdly bouncy, not the densely delicious Southern cornbread I was expecting.  The fried chicken entree came highly recommended by my server, but I found it overfried and undersalted.  It was very dark and intensely crunchy, but not delicious.  And it arrived sitting in a wet pool of collard greens.  The greens were tasty but the crispy chicken sitting and getting soggy in a pool of the liquor from the greens was weirdly unappetizing.  Maybe the fryer was too busy with fish fry (which was good, from the tastes I got from others at my table).  But I'm not really tempted to go back."}
{"text":"I'll make this easy: Julep is the best new restaurant in Madison.    The longer version:  My mouth waters every time I think about the possibility of dining at Julep.  After a week long road trip through Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana earlier this year, one of our first stops was at Julep so that we could reprise the southern flavors of our vacation.  The standout dish is the perlou - smoke white fish, oysters and Andouille sausage on grits - an especially amazing meal on fall and winter evenings.  Also terrific is the fried chicken thigh, which brings the heat and which is big enough to share.  Other notables include biscuits with homemade condiments (e.g., honey butter), shrimp & grits, cornbread, and (for our vegetarian daughter) mac and cheese.  The draft beer selection is good, liquor selection outstanding.  I recommend dinner over brunch.  I have to stop writing this, or I will need to drive to Julep right now."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this place, as we were walking our dog across the Isthmus. Lucky for us, there's a nicely-designed outdoor courtyard at Julep (shared with a wine bar and coffee shop) -- and they allow well-behaved pugs there. While it was a warmish evening, the restaurant also provided outdoor propane heaters when the temperature dipped. The wait staff were all extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu.  Which brings me to the food: It's well presented and super tasty. Since moving to Madison from New York City, I've been impressed by so many restaurants here. And Julep is now in the top--tier pantheon! Great (and yet inventive) Southern fare. Definitely try their Sno-cone-like mint julep... gorgeous presentation and (like all the food we tried) ultra-delicious."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated, charming restaurant that feels both down-to-earth and elegant. Really hearty Southern food with thoughtful preparation - Shrimp and Grits are a must have, and best biscuits of my life! Killer bar set-up too and when the garage door is open to the patio I can't imagine a better place to enjoy Madison summer.  It's just a matter of time until their brunch is out of control busy. Madison has been needing a spot like this!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Julep is really cozy in that style I can only describe as looking like it was designed by that \"Fixer-Upper\" couple.  We went in the middle of the week and were able to be seated immediately.  Service was really smooth and all of the staff were attentive.  Their menu is small, with starters, small and large plates.  Despite the limited choices we had a hard time selecting.  The two of us shared a starter, 2 small plates and a large plate.  That was plenty and I regretted not saving any room for dessert.  The pea salad was nicely seasoned and fresh.  The tamales came with 2 and I think are best to share.  Really good but the tamale dough seamed too heavy to be able to eat a plate of on my own.  Our large plate was the perlou.  It was really smokey and flavorful, though the sausage overpowered the whitefish and oysters.  I wished there was a sauce with it.  The star for me was the ham terrine starter.  It was served with whole grain mustard, pickled green beans and toast.  Every element was great on it's own and it all worked really well together."}
