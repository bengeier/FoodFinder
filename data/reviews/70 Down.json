{"text":"Came in for the grand opening. Was honestly not really feeling the place. Food samples tasted pretty awful. Stuff was expensive for no apparent reason. No offense, not my scene."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with 70 Down in yorkville!!! not only were the staff super attentive and friendly, the owner was accessible and working right in the restaurant. He came over to ask how the food was and my party. I had no idea, but the restaurant/lounge turns into a club! (not to mention they serve food during the club hrs) Around 1030 11pm the lounge then converts into a very hip club with all sorts coming to enjoy some drinks and the music. I can defiantly appreciate what they put together with this place.  Aside from the club aspect...the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I came here for my gf's birthday party on a Good Friday. I was in my friends booth, at the back of the club. Towards my stay at the end, the bus boy was routinely cleaning the table and while I was dancing and having a good time, he kept trying to get my attention, by pointing at a few empty glasses and to pass it to him. He did that for a good 1 minute! Until I courteously passed him MY glass over to him just to leave me alone. And of course he did not leave me alone because there were a few other glasses (4 more to be exact) that he wanted.   I did not come to this establishment to look for a bus boy job. If I wanted to, I wouldn't have come dressed up in heels for my gf's birthday. It was so disrespectful to ask your guest to do your job. And I totally get \"helping\" the staff, but this was crossing the line. If this was supposed to be a \"high-end\" place, be ready to help their staff clean and do their job, because there was nothing high-end about it."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant with friendly staff. The set up is very unique and quiet environment. The food is mouth watering and presentation is spectacular. Will be heading back very soon."}
{"text":"One to avoid at all costs. The restaurant was very empty on a Saturday night. And when I mean empty, we were the only people there. I think this is the norm as what seemed to be the owners were sitting a few tables down us and were very loud, giving a very unprofessional vibe to the atmosphere. In terms of food, I ordered a medium well steak that was so raw in the centre that I could taste how cold it was and about 50% of the steak was fat. When they brought it out on a tiny plate it was cut up into little strips and piled, it was grotesque to look at. Only reason I ate the 50% meat was because I was intimidated to say anything to the owners, I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could and I didn't want 40 something dollars to go completely down the drain. If I was a restaurant owner I would have been mortified if my customers felt the way I did. Overall with this mess of a restaurant you can tell the owners don't have a lot of experience in the food service industry which kind of made me feel sorry for them. I think if they want to improve their restaurant (which I really hope they do) they should do two things: 1. Go to quality restaurants in the area and see how the food and experience differs 2. Be more receptive to people's feedback. When you have so many negative comments it means something is wrong on your end that needs to be corrected  Good luck! :)"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the worst clubs I've been to in toronto.   After arriving I was pushed around by a security officer who got a \"little to personal\" when it came to frisking. After that was finished, I was questioned about a gift I was about to give to a friend inside the club. It was a labelled container of organic bath bombs... She then told me to rip it open or leave it at the door to make sure I wasn't bringing alcohol into the club.  This would have been reasonable if she hadn't let a huge group of people in ten minutes later blunts in mouth puffing their way through the floor.  Huge waste of time, terrible, rude service."}
{"text":"Never had such bad experience, service was awful,foods were totally different from the menu and photos. My main dish was Kabuli polo with beef shank,but it didn't have even one small piece of meet. My dessert was Baghlava and it was supposed to be with icecream based on the menu, but they didn't bring any ice-cream with it. The only good thing was their live music. Don't waste your time and money at this resturant"}
{"text":"Don't do it! 70 Down really misses the mark. Located on Yorkville Ave, you'd think they would have some elegance and refinement. Think again, this place is tacky. It looks as though 70 Down hires its employees from an escort agency..perhaps they are running a side business? Employees are rude and do not provide quality service, but then, 70 Down seems to attract a nouveau riche crowd anyway. With so many great dining options in Yorkville, I shall never return to 70 Down. **Check their other page on Yelp. They have a history of dissatisfied customers."}
{"text":"We went to 70 down last night for dinner with two of my girlfriends. We been here few times for bdays and parties (love their djs) but never dined here. However one of my girlfriends is Afghan so she really wanted to try the food here and we decided to give it a try. We let her ( the Afghan friend) order for us all. We got the beef dumplings (montu), lamb chops and grilled chicken ( morgh) and a side of challow ( white rice).  Everything tasted amazing! The lamb chops were cooked to perfection, the chicken was moist and flavourful, you can tell it's been marinated for a longtime and the rice was tasty and fragrant. But my fav was the montu, it was so creamy and flavourful that we ordered another order of it. We had two bottles of New Zealand wine which paired nicely with the meal. The owner came by to ask us if we were good, how we enjoyed the food etc. which we thought was sweet. Our waiter was also really kind and attentitive as well. Overall ide def go bck. I don't understand the bad reviews - we tried to find the disputed egg dish below on the menu and we couldn't lol."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place a star..this place doesn't even deserve a star. We went there last night with bunch of our frienda ( a group of 12). The decor is kinda of bad with all the red lights and red cheap carpets. It reminds me of a an Asian massage place. We ordered two shishas and a round of drinks. My friend asked for a glass of water and the waiter told us he will bring water for everyone. At the end of the night we asked for our bill. Guess what?? They charged us $15 for freaking water. I have been to many restaurants and bars and I was never charged unless I ordered sparkling water not TAP water. We never asked for water for everyone and once they brought us we thought it is tab water. My fiance went and asked the manager and he told him the water is FILTERED water and he was rude too!!!! I mean it is redicoulous. Such a rip off. First of all, the waiter should have let us know that we were going to get charged for water which to me looked like tab water ( it wasn't in a bottle or anything), second of all, the manager should have removed the charge.  our bill was $260 but the fact that we paid for something that we never asked for is pissing me off. I would never go back and I would never recommend this place to anyone. Very overpriced place for what they offer."}
{"text":"Our food was cold, the portions are very small and totally different from the menu. We ordered the Kabouli polo that is supposed to come with shank but surprisingly it didn't have even one piece of meat! We had to wait for more that 30 mins to order a food, the resturant was cold. Do not go to thos place, it's a rip-off."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night, at first it was just us there but still the servers came to us very late. We went there specifically for the Shisha, and after they brought it we saw it's just a vaporizer. It was an Electronic Hookah, but the waitress never mentioned this to us and it was freaking 50$!!! I myself have a vaporizer in house but I'm pretty sure this was defective and although we told them they never fix it for us.  The cocktails are so expensive and taste nasty. 17 $ for oriental express, and it was impossible to drink that, it really tasted very strong and bad.  They also add the tip 18% on the bill, so just one shisha and one cocktail costs 90$. And it wasn't even good.  Never ever going back again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my experience at 70 Down. We booked dinner for 5 people during Winterlicious for my mom's birthday. Our reservation was at 7 but upon arrival we were told that they were still getting our table ready. Not a big deal because my mom was running 10 minutes behind. When she got there we still weren't seated, which was weird because the restaurant only had two other parties in it - there were a lot of empty tables. When we asked again they said the table still wasn't ready. We waited until 7:30 before asking again and were told this time that they were waiting for another party to leave. Keep in mind the restaurant had a ton of empty tables they could have put us at and we had a reservation. Not only that but while we were waiting they seated a couple of 4 person groups that just walked in off the street. Overall it was a very negative experience. We ended up leaving and getting dinner elsewhere. I will not be returning to 70 Down."}
{"text":"Holllllyyyy craaapp I guess rich people will just about buy anything, a regular shisha costs 50$ in scarborough it's you can get as cheap as 10$!!!!"}
{"text":"I visited 70 Down today (sat 21) with my sis n bff and honestly I have to say it's THE best place in Yorkville right now. This resto/club has a great atmosphere (it was set up very nice for the holiday as well/ I loved the tree) and great chill music. I felt very welcomed by one of the owners (Alex) as well the employees right away as we walked in. We came for food, drinks and sheesha; Alex came to our table and recommended some amazing sharing foods for the 3 of us - everything was DELICIOUS! We also had some very cool n yummy cocktails. At the end of our dinner we had these delicious (special to 70 Down) smoking shots with sheesha. We left feeling buzzed n full and had zero complaints. I also loved the fact that Alex took the time to come and visit our table, that was a great touch. And of course we took Uber, no drinking and driving!"}
{"text":"really disappointed with this restaurant.   I checked in on yelp and there was a promotion going on where you get 20% off for the first time. So we ordered our food and i proceeded to show my waitress the offer through yelp and she told me it wasn't valid. i asked her to check with her manager and let me know because that wouldn't really be right.   so she comes back and asks to see my phone and to show her my check in offer... and then asks to take my phone with her to the back. she goes away out of my sight and comes back. She states that it will probably be valid but when her other manager comes in, she will need to see it again. of course i had no problem with that.  So we proceed to order our food, we got the tandoori chicken, the lamb chops , the lamb leg and rice and the lions chicken.   i thought it was nice that we were given a sample of their dips and some naan.    the lamb chops, which we paid $42 for 4 small pieces came out cold.. when i mentioned that to her, she was like that's not possible. Anyhow, the rest of the food was warm and flavourful. we had the raisin rice and it was a good pick over the plain rice.    so now comes time to ask for the bill, i asked for it and she said that the 20% off would only be honoured for my meal. I said that's not a problem because everyone on the table has an active yelp profile and can check in as well to have the same discount apply to their respective meals. she proceed to tell me that because i was the first one to mention it that it would only be honoured for me, everyone else would have to come back to use theirs. this ticked me off because the offer is for checking in and off your first meal - everyone was there for the first time.   Again she asks to see my phone and proceeds to walk away with it. this made me really uncomfortable but it was the only way they were going to honour my check-in benefit.   would i return again? probably not after that experience. but the lamb and chicken was good."}
{"text":"Money grabbing place, charging for more drinks than were originally orders in attempt to make more tips, $20 cover on a Thursday, $5 coat check. I would never come here again"}
{"text":"I am only giving a one star because the DJ that night was abysmal. DJ khan is by far the worst DJ known to man and he really brought down the review of this place. Usually this place has a great atmosphere with amazing music. I think they cheaped out on the DJ's and got this loon to come in and DJ and let me tell you, it went from a 10 to a 2 real quick. I really didn't like this experience at all and I hope they never invite him back. He needs a new career."}
{"text":"Great place!"}
{"text":"We had a large group of people attend this resto lounge. There was a live performance and it was great. The performer interacted with everyone and made the evening enjoyable.   I ordered food and it did not arrive at all but the rest of my party received their food in a timely manner. When I asked the waiter about my food he advised me that it was coming. I cancelled the order because my party had finished their meal and my meal was nowhere to be seen. The waiter ended up bringing the food anyway when everyone else's plates were cleared away.   There was a mixup in the bills and misunderstandings that occurred. We were charged for appetizers we didn't order and were sent to the table. The waiter was upset and there was no resolution so we ended up paying the bill because it was pointless going back and forth.   Someone requested to speak to the manager. The manager took care of us and really went above and beyond to provide excellent customer service.  I would suggest speaking to the manager right away if there are any issues because he really knows how to provide excellent customer service. He has a good heart and genuinely cared, and because of his great customer service I would consider returning."}
{"text":"Ok so I totally did not expect much from the place however as soon as we entered the manager Seb (my fav new Armenian ) totally catered to our party of 10 and def made the night memorable .  The service was amazing friendly staff  Amazing manager Seb your amazing !  The food ... Being Assyrian from Iran ... Ummmm pretty damn good my hat off to the chef!  We even let Seb order for us !  My Italian girls and Especially birthday girl had the best time !!!  The only thing I recommend ... Guys get some sweets !!! Lol  Thank you again loved it !!!!"}
{"text":"W stumbled in without knowing what to expect. The service was excellent! The server gave us recommendations and explained what they are. We ended up getting the burger, beef kabob and a rice dish. I would have to say the rice was my favourite. It's medley seasoned with lamb sauce, mixed with carrots, raisins and chicken. The flavour is not too strong and is perfect to pair with the beef kabob. I would recommend coming in with a bigger group to try more dishes :)"}
{"text":"Good music. First time here. So far pretty nice people. People can look kind of upscale. But nice set up though. Expensive much? For e hookah session for 50 dollars. That can barely produce vapor. Wrong choice of pipe for it, too tall for a 6 watt device. I was glad I brought my own vapor device. People were was impressed with my device then the 50 dollar session device setup. Like i said, too tall of a water bong for that device. Great idea though."}
{"text":"Nope definitely one to avoid. Pretty much everything is wrong with 70 Down. The atmosphere is pretty dull and pretentious. Imagine like someone had the same tastes as Scarface from the 1970s. very ugly. Too much red and gold.  What were they thinking? We sampled the food but stopped because it does not work. Red meat was tough. The rice was not cooked and the berries were crunchy. The egg was OK but how can you mess up a boiled egg I guess. The sign claims they are also a lounge but no one lounging there because of the ugly interior. Finally the bathroom stank. I am sorry but ... never mind a strange experience.   Answer to owner's comment:  A review is not malicious. It is a review. This is why yelp exists. You do serve eggs. Walk into your kitchen and ask. It also shows good management skills to interact with the staff. It is also important to know your menu.  The décor is ugly. Could you explain why you have two listings on Yelp? Have you moved or changed your number? Or is it because, I just looked, and the other one had collected many negative reviews?  Finally, I noticed that the only other review on your 'new' profile is someone called Sarah H. Why is there no comment from you to Sarah H. notifying her that she \"maliciously\" has left two reviews??? Also, a note regarding English, which I hope you might find helpful: it is 'you're' or 'you are' and not 'your.'  I suggest you improve your service, decor, food and washroom.   Thanks."}
{"text":"I promised this year to stop posting mean things online. I will put it as nicely as possible. This was probably one of the most unbelievable experiences dining out in my life from start to finish."}
{"text":"Customer goes to overpriced sheesha place to hang out with friend. Customer is served well by the polite hostesses, and has an OK time. Owner has a problem with customer (perhaps because he is having a bad day, or maybe just a jerk, not exactly sure why) Owner tells off customer.  Customer does not create a scene, instead decides to write a yelp review. The following ensues.  Customer ( to yelpers ) : Stay away, owner is a jerk ---- Owner ( to yelpers) : This customer is bad, I am good. I am part of the hospitality industry, and this is the worst customer ever. By the way, please come to my business, but just don't write about it or I will embarrass you. Owner (to customer) : I got your money already, don't come back. ---- Customer (to owner) : Thanks for confirming. Your allegation is false. Learn from your mistake. Customer (to yelpers) : This is exactly what I was talking about ---- Owner (to himself) : I will add a paragraph to the original response so it looks like I originally expected a rebuttal. Owner (to yelpers) : Please come to my business, but just don't write about it or I will embarrass you. Owner (to customer) : I got your money already, don't come back and stop annoying me. ---- Customer ( to himself) : He doesn't learn, does he? Let's have some fun. Customer (to yelpers) : Hey! Let me try to make you laugh. Customer (to owner) : Learn from your mistake.  ===  Details in the review and response below."}
{"text":"Brutal in so many ways. 2 beers and 4 jagerbombs was $80  Look away from your full beer at the bar and the servers take it then act like they've never seen you before and say you'll have to order another. Watched this happen 3 times. Won't be back!"}
