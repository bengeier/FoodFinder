{"text":"Good food but there are no set prices on coffee!!! 
Every time I get charged differently. Very frustrating when you don't know what your bill will be.
1st time I paid just for the meal, coffee was included. This time (2 days later) they charged me 2$ extra for the coffee and another $1 for the refill on the coffee. That is almost 30% of hidden charges."}
{"text":"Got breakfast and was very pleased with the service and food quality. The place has a nice simple feel to it. Portions were very large for decent prices. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Tasty diner fare, friendly servers, and fast service. If you're in the neighbourhood, you're assured a good meat & eggs breakfast. If not, they'll welcome you with open arms."}
{"text":"The cook is extremely nice! He always welcomes you at the door! The food is typical greasy spoons diner like, good if you like that type! It's close by to us so we enjoy the proximity and the easy going atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My friends who are regulars brought me here today, they love this place and now i see why. I had the eggs Benedict and it was amazing and huge. It came with 3 eggs and a large portion of peameal and some delicious hollandaise. My friends both had breakfasts as well and were very happy.  Also the fresh squeezed OJ was great. I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"One day, I was walking along College Street, and I was craving a milkshake, so I stepped into Chew Chew's Diner. Since I only grabbed a beverage to go, I didn't truly experience all that the diner had to offer.

My milkshake was surprisingly small, and expensive. $3+tax for a 16 ounce milkshake? Come on!"}
{"text":"Very poor experience for brunch
Server (gentleman) was quite engaging but food was way overcooked, burnt in some cases on eggs and toast 
Not very good value for the money either in my opinion 
I won't be back - too many other great places to try"}
{"text":"I live close by and have eaten at Chew Chew's numerous times.  The staff are extremely warm and are always courteous.  Their portions are quite generous and prices are very reasonable.  The restaurant seems to be kept quite clean as well.

Their menu is actually quite varied for a greasy spoon and you'll surely be surprised at the selection.
So far I've sampled their Chicken Caesar Salad, Fish and Chips, Cheeseburgers, Clubhouse Sandwich, and Eggs Benedict.  I have no complaints about any dish, but I especially love their Halibut Fish & Chips.  Not too greasy and plenty of fries.  

I've ordered food for takeaway on my way home from work and had it waiting for me neatly packaged with all proper garnishes and utensils included without having to ask.  

As long as they maintain their current standards and pricing I'll be a long time customer.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Did I go to the same Chew Chew's the other reviewers did???

Gloomy waitress, non-existent service, waitress brought the wrong menu item (some hardened fish with weird breading), and then angrily denied that she brought the wrong thing.  Chips were overcooked, barely ok.

Was I in an episode of Restaurant Stakeout and didn't know it?

It was slightly improved by a cheery gentleman who was so nice I didn't have the heart to tell him I hated the food and service.  Another day I might have sent the food back, but it must have been near closing time, they were mostly ignoring me and shutting the lights off.

Still, I will try it again and follow up on this review."}
{"text":"Just awful! Had breakfast here, first off let me start off by saying please please please teach the cook how to make a potato. I wouldn't even consider this food edible and I'm not exaggerating! Being a fan of eggs Benedict and it's my usual breakfast staple, I decided to give it a try at this place they call a restaurant. The home fry potatoes were not even cooked and more leading on the raw side. The Benedict sauce isn't even a sauce... It's more leading on the water side. Service is \"here's your food please don't ask me for anything else, even if you wanted to you won't see me for the remainder of your awful time here\""}
{"text":"I like the breakfasts very much. Haven't tried lunch or dinner meals yet but based on breakfast, they're probably tasty and well made. 

When I've asked to make changes to my meal they've been very nice about it. Refills come regularly. Staff are friendly. 

Plus the servers are cute!"}
{"text":"Great menu selection, very friendly staff that can make a new customer feel like part of the family.  All in all, it's always been a good experience there.  

I would stay away from their mixed drinks, but other than that, you're in good hands at this place.  Definately recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give 1/2 a star. This was undoubtedly the worst lunch/brunch we have had in a very long time. Omelette: crunchy?  Pulled pork on a bun: just plainly grim.  After reading the reviews I was excited about trying and should have known better when we walked in mid lunch and the place was almost empty. Just don't do it.  Expensive stomach ache was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"All awesome! Good food, quick service by friendly staff, train decor and decent prices. Breakfast and lunch was good."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Chew Chew's so much. My friends are university students who live downtown, and it's super close to their place, and they've said that it's great.

So I went one hungover morning with a couple friends (by the way dear readers, everything usually tastes good when I'm hungover). I should've just gone with the classic eggs and toast. Alas, I chose the  special on chocolate chip bread French toast. Oh, it had such potential when I saw the sign. It was pretty expensive--like $10/$13--compared to everything else on the menu, but I thought I could do with some calories.

I got freshly squeezed orange juice. Drank that down like it was Draino for my liver (it was). It was delicious. 2 stars! The food took like less than 10 minutes to arrive.

I will now describe to you the worst French toast I have ever eaten in my life:

It looked pretty good, and it came with  home potatoes. I poured a bit maple syrup on top, and sliced into it. \"Hm,\" I thought, \"Wonder why the bread's an inch thick.\" Took a bite. The bread was like a super heavy cake bread (similar to banana bread) and so it had absorbed the egg and had a layer of overcooked egg all around it. Not even like cinnamon-y  or salted egg, or anything. That was probably the worst part. The chocolate chips were really gooey, but this worsened the weird heaviness of it. It came with two giant slices and I probably literally had four bites. It was like thick, uniformly sweet, bready glue in my mouth. I could barely swallow. After 5 minutes, it became so soggy it self-decomposed on my plate and crumbled because it couldn't handle it's own weight. The home potatoes turned out to be very dry and gross.


I spent like $23 with tax and tip, and it was a very disappointing waste of money. I will however go back anyway, because I always give second chances.

**My friend liked his eggs Benedict and my other friend liked his pancakes. It's quite possible that I have high standards, but one of them tried my soggycakebreadeggtoast and agreed that it was awful"}
{"text":"We walked to this local diner w an easy vibe. I tried peabacon for the first time- like a ham & i liked it. Fresh eggs, good rye, big portion.  Husband ate all his cinnamon french toadt w strawberries. Waiter Steven was super Canadian nice & spent time with us discussing Toronto, sports & pop vs. soda."}
{"text":"Charming little diner was a great surprise! My sister and I traveled to Toronto for a concert at the Phoenix, right around the corner from this place. After realizing the place we had planned for lunch was dinner only on weekends, we dipped in for a quick lunch and I could not be happier! Enormous portions and quick, friendly service. I got the BLT, which was under $5, and my sister got the Greek salad with chicken, which was huge. Their coffee was also a great pick me up. A lovely regular patron overheard us talking and realized we were from the states. He came over to chat and welcome us to town. In fact, the place seemed to be crawling with regulars, which is always a good sign in my book. He informed us our server was actually one of the owners, and we had a nice time chatting with him too. I will definitely be returning next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This diner is cozy with a friendly atmosphere. The service was prompt and attentive. The food was a sizable portion.  I ordered the railside omelette and it was fully loaded with mushrooms, bacon, cheese, etc. It was paired with home fries and toast. The  omellwtte wasn't greasy and the bacon was perfectly cooked not too crunchy or dry. Very flavuorful. I would definitely come back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Train theme? Yes, please.

Interior decorated like the inside of a train car, complete with false scenery? Hell, yes.  

Menu items with names like \"Conductor's special\"? Ooooh, yeah.

One of my regular breakfast places, although food is just okay. My favourite item on the menu is the club sandwich. The classic breakfast, and eggs benedict are nice as well. My least favourite are the things with cheese slices. Like, the rubbery, violent yellow, Kraft slice kind. 

Sometimes things can be a little sneaky. Like charging for coffee refills. And not having a side dish included with the sandwiches. So, if you are asked if you would like fries, it actually costs extra. 

Return for that romantic feeling of dining in a train car while eating the Big Track Burger. No, seriously, it is really fun."}
{"text":"Wouldnt recommend it. The food is too greasy and the coffee tastes like water. I was hyped when i read the other comments but now i am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Greasy spoon. I might be mistaken but they may have started using real cheese in their grilled cheese. Potatoes are unreliable. Sometimes crisp, sometimes soggy. Bacon and eggs are usually done well. Staff are great. Be prepared to surround yourself by the drunk and underemployed. Great place for filling yourself up quickly and regretting your far consumption soon after."}
{"text":"I was really surprised that this place was not busy. 
The food was fantastic and the service was great. 
Alex our waiter was right on with the menu and service . Very pleased and will certainly be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  All of the servers are very friendly and FAST.  The food is exactly what you'd expect from a diner.  One of my favorite breakfast spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast. Love the home fries! Entrées come with complimentary coffee. Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I finally ventured into Chew Chew's Diner after years of walking past and was pleasantly surprised.

We both ordered the egg and sausage breakfast and it came hot and fresh. The eggs and sausage were really good, but the ham was a bit of a let down and tasted way too processed.

Negative one star for the filthy, outdated washrooms, would be four stars otherwise."}
{"text":"Bumping up to 4 stars. I've been here a number of times now, and they are consistently good...good food, good service."}
{"text":"Shame on me ... I've lived in the neighbourhood for eight years, and for eight years have passed this place on my walks to and from work, wondering what it was like and never stopping in. Finally broke the trend on Sunday, with a late lunch for both my husband and me. Ordered the Eggs Benedict and a coffee, husband had the Conductor's Special and an OJ (which turned out to be freshly squeezed). The Eggs Benedict were ridiculously good, probably the best hollandaise I have ever had. Three perfectly poached eggs sat on top of a rather large serving of peameal bacon, hiding the english muffin underneath. The side of breakfast potatoes were a little underseasoned, nothing that a bit of salt couldn't help. The coffee was the best diner coffee - fresh, and drink-more-able. The husband's breakfast consisted of twenty pounds of food - three scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon (and more bacon, requested instead of the ham), hashbrowns, toast and two fluffy pancakes. The location was clean, the staff were friendly, and the diner-fare was top notch."}
{"text":"This Diner is one of my absolute favourites in Downtown Toronto. Consistently they deliver great food and a cool Diner atmosphere that keeps me coming back. Everything is a great portion size and tastes fantastic. This is a traditional Diner in every sense of the word.

My reason for this review is actually related to the loss of a wallet at our table during our last visit. A few hours after our meal we realized it might still be there so we called and one of their wait staff said he wasn't on shift during out meal but would contact the other staff member to find out and would call me either way. 

We luckily found the wallet and I thought nothing more of it until the wait staff called back to let me know they were sorry but looked everywhere and couldn't find. I sincerely thanked them and knew a review was in order.

Businesses that take a few moments to make sure their customers are serviced well need to be recognized just as much as the ones who don't provide great service.

Thanks Chew Chew's! I'll see you next week."}
{"text":"Solid and friendly diner. Had some sandwiches to go, but unfortunately, they forgot to put on any sauces so the chicken was rather dry. Spiced properly, but dry. Too bad, however, because this was an honest mistake, we will go again and try other stuff. Very clean and nice inside!"}
{"text":"Finally I made it to this place. Any restaurant is good when you go with the right company but unfortunately for this place, I was with the best company possible, my friend James, and it still managed to disappoint. I find breakfast out to always be a bit of a disappointment anyway, so it is an uphill battle to impress me, I prefer breakfast at home. I found it to be a bit expensive for what it was and the presentation sucked.  I would say this place is surviving on its history more then the quality of the food. I wouldn't be back even if it were suggested... just too many other places that can deliver better."}
{"text":"A gem of a place...dont let the location and the outer décor fool you. All my friends that I have taken them to the Chew always say the same thing.Wow...what a great place. Its my local Eatery that i am very proud of. The staff are great and friendly. Be warned, the portions are huge so bring an appetite!

Doughboy"}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! The all day breakfast is great but today liver and onions and soup was tasty and filling"}
{"text":"This place is my destination for hung over Eggs Benedict! They have all different kind of bennies, also have a crazy selection of poutines although Ive yet to be daring enough to try one of them. 

I usually stick with my classic eggs Benedict with pea male. Their hollandaise sauce is rich and creamy and usually generous.  

I recently had a burger that wasnt reallly amazing had processed cheese on it which wasnt really appetizing but for 8.99 what do you really expect. I still rate this place 5 stars because of the neighborhood diner feel, friendly fast service, and delicious eggs benedict. This is a family run business and they truly make you feel like they appreciate your business, which makes you happy to come back.  

I also noticed while dining there that they sometimes will give basic breakfasts to homeless people for whatever they can afford to pay. I think thats really cool that they do that."}
{"text":"I come here regularly for the Egg's Bene!  It is amazing and they have some great choices.  The service is always very fast and friendly.   The food is always consistent and you get a huge amount.  Once you start thinking about it you crave it, see you soon Chew Chew's :)"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite local diner.  Emphasis on diner...if you want artisanal breads, eggs laid by pet chickens, and aged cheddar on your grilled cheese, stop at an ATM on your way to a fancier restaurant. No pretence here, quality food well prepared, quick service, and you can linger over coffee for a bit without feeling like you are being rushed out the door.  Lots of choice on the menu, and tempting home-made daily specials.  Their classic turkey club on rye is a fave...they roast the turkey on site.  Great hash browns and fries, and eggs that aren't cooked to death.  There have been some management and staff changes over the last while, and though the food has actually improved (better hash browns, more tender omelettes) there have been a few servers that didn't make the grade.  Prices are fair.  A suggestion: freshen the place up and repaint.  I've taken people from out of town here, and they wished their town had a place like this.  I'll be back!   (The take out business seems popular too.)"}
{"text":"I like to experiment with new brunch places. Specially if they a walking distance from me. 

Having said that, I have always been a fan of the brunch and enjoy checking out the odd grease spoon place. Better yet, going to check the odd diner since they remind me of a simpler time, large portions with odd racist undertones and familiar scenes from Back To The Future. 

Really though, the reason why I enjoy them for the retro decour and the forever hope that they not only serve floats but some delicious item that makes them unique. 

Well, not in this case. Chew Chew's Diner is a train themed diner, however beyond that it just another diner with not so many, so-so home fries and is a bit overpriced for what you get, quality wise. 

Again, is it expensive? No, not really but I have had some really great brunches for less than $10 at say Johnny G's just down the street.

Not to mention the somewhat unsavoury characters that walked in that were refused entry because they were drinking in public. Also the place is not as big and the eggs Benny I ordered where just so-so. Plus the server gave us the vibe that he was just too busy to be too helpful even though we were just right in front of the kitchen/bar/cash. 

Don't get me wrong, they were not bad, they were just not great even if the decour may be a bit eye catching. So, would I come back? Well, my brunch-mate and I agreed, although not one of the best brunches we have had , that it would be in our third tier of places to have a brunch at. So all in all, a right on the mark A-Ok rating.   

Needless to say I will drop by again, I am just not in a hurry to do so."}
{"text":"I live in the area and always walk by this place, usually on the way to another breakfast joint - I finally decided to check it out.

We were a group of 3 who all ordered something different.  The eggs benedict that my friend order looked amazing and was quite large.  I got a regular bacon and eggs breakfast which was pretty good (bacon was excellent).  The other person in our group got an upgraded breakfast with pancakes, which weren't my favorite.

Service was great up until we wanted to leave and pay our bill, however aside from that they were super attentive and very friendly.

I've given it 3 stars instead of 4 because the food wasn't the best in neighbourhood and to be honest, was fairly greasy.  But that being said, I would come here again because it's still pretty cheap and close to my house."}
{"text":"I came by for a quick dinner with my friends before they hit the Phoenix.

I ordered a hot liver sandwich and asked for the fries to be upgraded to an eggs benedict (!) poutine instead. 

The hot liver sandwich was okay, nice thick white bread, starchy, diner gravy and frozen liver (a little on the tough side). I only ate about 1/3 of the large order of poutine, as the hollandaise was very very creamy and I'm not supposed to eat dairy (I take an exception for butter). What I was able to eat before my body objected was delicious and totally worth it.

The service was passable and the the atmosphere was perfectly dinerish. Every once in a while, the cook (wearing a conductor's hat!!!!)  would walk by and say hi, and ask how we were doing. That was a really nice touch. I would definitely go back again. Apparently they had a special that we didn't see until we left... 4 domestic bottles of beer and a pound of wings for $20!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast is def eggs benny - This is pretty much what I only eat at Chew Chew's. The 3-egg Benedict is the best! The hollandaise sauce is just phenomenal! If you're a fan of eggs bennys go try this place!!"}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place another shot. this time I went with all aboard special  since u didn't really want pancakes. Like the last time I went there were some issue but different issues. 

The eggs were cook fine and peameal bacon was good. the ham was just off in taste but still edible. Sausage was okay and bacon expect for ends of a few pieces which were really chewing  it was fine.

I always said home fries were  my main issue with most places. They were fine up until the last few ones. They either weren't clean right or cook all the way. Either way it's a good meal for most part, service  was good. Chew Chew diner isn't a place I will  dismiss just  yet."}
{"text":"Really depends on the server, today with sloppy burger, one thin napkin provided. Server didn't notice and difficult to catch his eye and get more."}
{"text":"Had an amazing breakfast! my husband and I both had the egg Benedict. Very good!!! the eggs cooked perfectly...the sauce was wonderful and the peameal bacon was cooked just right. The service was fast and very friendly. We will definitely come back when we are Toronto again. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. So diner-ish. This is not a high end restaurant in the least but price is great and portions are huge!!  And only serve fresh oj and gj.  Servers are awesome and special orders don't upset them!!  Loved it"}
{"text":"This is a true example of a diner! Huge portions, delicious food - attentive and friendly  staff, great atmosphere. We went there on recommendation from friends. This will now easily be our regular hangout for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"$25 tax in.  for club sandwich on rye with fries. Partner had 3 eggs, amazing bacon, home fries and toast, unlimited coffee and unlimited coke. Deal of the century. They could use some flavour in the potatoes but ample food and fast service and cheap! This place doesn't try to be something it's not. It's honest diner food at a decent price. Two Thumbs up."}
{"text":"The first thing that drew my attention to this diner was, of course, reading about the train theme. (Second was that I found that it took the place of The Steerburger Restaurant that was around when I worked in the area in the 90's.) There's a large train mural on the side wall outside, and lots of train stuff inside, from scenic pictures in train windows instead of actual windows on the mural wall, and an entire train-themed menu.

It's pretty standard breakfast fare, all-day breakfasts, omelettes, pancakes, waffles. I've only had a dinner meal once, the hot hamburger sandwich I believe. This morning I had the All Aboard Special, a plateful of eggs/bacon/ham/sausage/homefries/toast/coffee. I would say the food has always been good, nothing fantastic but consistently good. Same for the service; this morning's server seemed a little gruff at first, but later seemed more naturally friendly, and was very quick with the coffee refills. Total bill was less than $15.

Overall, I always enjoy going there for the train theme and casual neighbourhood feel. I have been there a few times now, and will continue going back. The one caution I will give, I went once on a Sunday morning, and they were packed for brunch, it's the only time I had to wait in line for a table."}
{"text":"Some people might think I'm crazy for giving this place 5 stars, but this was one of the most satisfying breakfasts I've had in a while. We arrived and were able to get a booth in the front, and had menus in our hands within moments of being seated, and glasses of water and coffee were on the table quickly to follow.

The menu is pretty large, and where I normally try a restaurant first based on a classic eggs/meat/homefries/toast combo, instead of opting for the $7.99 3 egg classic breakfast, noticed a Meat Lovers Omelette for $11.99 which still had the home fries and toast, but a whole lot of meat in the eggs with some cheese. How could I not choose that thing being the pig meat aficionado that I claim to be?

The food came out very quickly, and was fantastic. I'm not talking about a fancy breakfast like some brunch places that try to impress with garnishes and fancy ingredients. I'm talking about a good old fashioned greasy spoon breakfast... If I was hungover it would have been even better.

Every bite of the Meat Lovers Omelette had some sort of salty pig flavours via the chopped up bits of peameal and strip bacon, sausage, and ham. Even the homefries were a good deepfried potato which complimented perfectly, save for a couple of the crunchy overcooked bits that ended up left on the plate. I even liked how the white toast is thick cut, although they do have the option for even rye bread should you want it.

Washed it down with a cold bottle of Steamwhistle, and were on our way back to the sunny streets for a meager $32 post tax/pre tip for 2 omelettes, a coffee and a beer. There's even a picture of a train on the side of the building, so in my best Ralph Wiggum impression I've gotta say, I Choo Choo Choose Chew Chews Diner."}
{"text":"Good, simple, diner food. The staff know all the regular customers and are always friendly."}
{"text":"Just terrible food. Didn't know where to go for breakfast so we tried this place I have been passing by  everyday. I was not expecting much and I was still disappointed! I order eggs Benedict. The potatoes are some microwaved reheated cardboard, eggs were like boiled eggs and the sauce tasted and looked like some mayonnaise and was probably coming from a jar. Very disappointing. The only thing that was ok is the \"home made\" orange juice, probably the only item actually home made.
Just avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Most consistent breakfast diner in the city, The veggie patty option with your breakfast is like no other that's because almost everywhere else does not have that option, staff is friendly and polite it's also nice and quite. 
You must try this place at least once and I'm sure you won't be disappointed, this place deserves to be on that show \"you must here\"."}
{"text":"I got my food delivered from the app Just Eat.  

I had the Greek Omelet and my gf had the Great Canadian Rail. There was a minimum charge of $25 unfortunately so I decided to get an apple juice and a side of mashed potatoes.  The mash potatoes had no option to add gravy but I ordered it anyways assuming it would come with som. Nope. Plain mash potatoes which I didn't eat. 

My Greek omelette was missing the salty taste that normally comes with feta cheese. Their feta is bland.  

My gf says her Great Canadian Rail omelette was pretty good albeit a bit dry. 

So in general not a great experience."}
{"text":"I like the setting, old diner, the booths at the front...
The three meals I've had; breakfast, club sandwich, hot turkey sandwich; all very average.  I'm not a huge fan of the 'microwave' being a big part of my meal (i.e. hot turkey).  I've had some great hot turkey/chicken type plates (especially in MTL), this is not great.  2nd handsmoke coming in from the back exit not pleasurable; staff smoking pre cooking, etc.  After 3 visits I think I'm done with CHEW CHEW'S, staff always very good; unfortunately food not much beyond mediocre.  Also need to add; don't be in a rush if you are visiting; SLOOOOW."}
{"text":"A solid diner! Tasty food, big portions, nice staff. Overall very good value. The interior could use some renovating, but the food and service are great and that's most important."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast the other day, and it was delightful!  I have always wanted to try a Greek omlette and am glad that I may the choice to do so here.  It was on special too; score!

The omlette was huge, filled with tomatoes, onions and feta.  I would absolutely get it again.  The home fries were some of the best I've had.  A nice bit of seasoning and so tasty.  The only thing that would have made them better if they were well done.  I like my home fries crispy!  I'm not a huge fan of orange, so was happy to see a slice of orange AND pineapple which was sweet and juicy.   I can't wait to go back!

One thing that I really love too is that you can tell they try to get to know the regular customers.  They have a draw every week for a gift certificate.  You just have to write your name and number on your reciept and put it in a jar.  I was paying debit one time and the waiter saw that I had written my name on it, put it in the container for me and purposely looked at the back so he knew my name when he said bye."}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! If you can make it past the prostitutes and drug addicts - OK, I exaggerate, its not THAT bad (until you go a bit south, then it really is that bad) - you can spot a old fashion diner on the corner lot. 

The service is immediately inviting and friendly and the restaurant is small but well laid out. How can you deny an illuminated faux window scene aimed to make you feel like your gazing out onto a foreign landscape...tacky as it gets, but hey, for this neighbourhood its an elegant touch.

Now I'll get onto the food! The menu is well priced with everything in and around the $8-13 range but please do come hungry. Portions here would give even our neighbours to the south a reason to let out their belt buckles a couple notches.

I swear, they must use about 5 eggs in their omelettes, and they are so fluffy and packed with all the good stuff. I'd steer clear of the more average options like perhaps some of the sandwiches, in place of the fantastic brunch items....oh ya and the souvlaki's in a pita etc (this ain't exactly the Danthforth). The Eggs Bennies were a tad pricey but BOY I've got to admit it was well worth the couple extra $$. Couldn't have asked for better stuff. Pretty much everything from the mains to the sides (addictively delicious hash taters, super buttery toast) were spot on.

Good hearty meals made fresh and served up with sincerity. This is the best diner I have been to and I can't wait to come back for some brunch tings!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast joint,  no frills dining experience and simple breakfast foods like their conductors special is my favourite with sausage, bacon,  ham,  and pancakes."}
{"text":"A local diner I've been meaning to put through it's paces for a while. This place has staying power. Compact, clean, friendly staff at brunch. With \"boogie shoes\" playing in the background, I tentatively take my first sip of oj expecting to be disappointed since I watched it being poured from a Fair-Lea jug, but lo and behold it's freshly squeezed! Amazing! The eggs BenFlorentine is pretty solid, but a little too much hollandaise. I'm going to have to run a workshop on what a dollop is to the brunch cooks of this city. Over-hollandaising is becoming an alarming trend in my estimation."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast diner.  The pancakes I ordered were a large order and so delicious.  I had strawberries and bananas on it.  My husband ordered the conductor's special and it was plentiful for sure.  Coffee was the typical diner coffee.  They were fairly stroller and baby friendly for a narrow restaurant, and were prompt in getting us water to heat up my son's bottle.  I also noticed they rushed another customer's child's order on their request which I thought was great.

We will definitely return as I do want to try the eggs benedict!"}
{"text":"Cheap breakfast, fresh fruit...eggs benny is made with peameal bacon and is a bit heavy. The homefries are very tasty.  Much better now than a year ago.  The servers work their butts off, so there's usually not much of a wait.  I haven't had lunch/dinner items, so this review is based solely on breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"A great local diner with amazing staff and good food... I dub it as my second head quarters as my partner and I would have business meetings there as work was taking place at our home.  

Love the staff there especially Angello who is always smiling.  Things I love on their menu...

Their soups... Any... YUM!
Chicken Souvlaki on a pita
Halibut Fish and Chips
Turkey Sandwich
Chicken Sandwich with Cheese (Massive)

and... their pies are amaaazing as desert... 

Do check them out!"}
{"text":"Not much to look at from the outside (or on the inside, really), but I'm glad we stopped in. Great service, big portions, and good diner food."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast last Saturday. My hubby and I both had eggs over easy with bacon, very well cooked  food and very good. A quiet very friendly quaint diner. Will recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice are a nice touch to start but the charm of this place is that it isn't a chain and you don't have to wait for hours for a table like Auntie and Uncles, which I found to be highly overrated and only popular because of its hipster friendly location.

Chew chews is at the edge of Cabbagetown and would likely be busier if closer to Parliament but if you get to House on Parliament and its backed for brunch, give Chew chews a try!

Hubby's greatest complaint is that the cheese in his omelette was cheese slices not real cheddar, but the potatoes made up for this flaw.

I love combos where you can get bacon and eggs AND pancakes, you can't get that at Cora's and I won't even acknowledge Golden Griddle as food!

It's a charming little spot that food snobs might not appreciate but if you are like me and don't ever make a full breakfast at home because of the number of pans required to cook bacon, eggs, home fries, pancakes, etc. Chew chews is your chance for an old school breakfast at a reasonable price!

I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I revamped this review a little, but my rating stays the same because it's the best spot in the city for a delicious benny at a reasonable price.

It's a cute diner, train themed if you didn't already get that. We loved to eat breakfast here when the boyfriend lived closer. There are a few things that aren't that great: the steak and eggs (according to the boyfriend), the strawberry milkshake (according to me) and the poutines. There are much better places in the city for a poutine, so why eat one here?

The eggs Florentine and Benedict, however, were to die for. The portions are huge. I got THREE slices of pemeal bacon on the Benedict, and a garden  full of spinach on the Florentine. Both came with THREE large and perfectly poached eggs. I love me some hollandaise so the rest of you can ask for a dollop, I'll take my ladle full.

Pro tip - and you heard it here first - you can share the eggs Benedict and Florentine between two people of modest appetites, provided you get something to share from the 'Light Breakfast' menu.

This is the place I started slowly falling in love with my boyfriend. We're going back to celebrate our first year together :)"}
{"text":"Chew chews is a local diner with fabulous homecooking, friendly waiters. Will be going back to try out the breakfast. Roasted potatoes I had with the hot chicken sandwich were amazing."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 stars since it has promise. I got the conductor's special for breakfast. The eggs and sausage were 4 stars but the ham and pancakes were 3. I'd give it another go with a different order next time. Cute little diner atmosphere and service is speedy and friendly. Shady neighbourhood though. Staff have an excellent sense if humour! Try it out."}
{"text":"Good selection of breakfast. 

Had  the Eggs Benedict to see if a place is a great, good or somewhat of a breakfast place. This is a nice place to sit down and enjoy. 

The Staff made it worth going to Chew Chew's Diner .

Will be back.  Thanks again"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, esp the home-fries! It was exactly what I was looking for in a breakfast spot! The service was very fast, and efficient. We ended up going back both days we were in Toronto, the 2nd day with a large group. I would recommend this diner to everyone!"}
{"text":"Their poutine doesn't use cheese curds (what?!) but they have Thanksgiving poutine and a serious train theme, so I still love it.

Portions are huge. Really huge. Come prepared."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5 big, tasty meals. We made take out with us because couldn't finish breakfast portions. 

Service: 5/5 no fake corporate smile. They really giving you friendly, no annoying attitude.

Price: 4/5 in other places you will have half of their portions.

Location: 3/5 couple of blocks from downtown.

 Will be back! Recommended! Super breakfast place!

{"text":"Dive diner at its finest!
All the retro diners need to study this place. 
Peameal bacon chunked into uneven chunks and grilled so there's little crispy and larger juicy bites in my omelette, combine that with real home fries, not frozen shredded crap and that there is a meal!
This place is rough around the edges and you want to sit in front because the cook is a riot"}
{"text":"As expected, a second visit turned my review into a four star one. Never again shall I order the mealy Eggs Florentine here. From this day forth, I shall only only two eggs any way, with tasty home fries, decent sliced fruit on the side and toast that's so buttered it'd make Nigella herself squeal with delight. I adore the servers here - they are over-the-top hospitable and kind, and they deliver everything to your table with grace and a smile. Bravo!"}
