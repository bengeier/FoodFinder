{"text":"Great rooftop view paired with amazing food! Definitely one of my favorite go-to spots in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"There is a rooftop area and often a crowd, so you should check it out for drinks. The food is OK but nothing special."}
{"text":"I like a lot of things about this place. I mostly come here to watch football with a group. They have a ton of tvs. The food is pretty good too for bar food. The giant soft pretzel is great but the cheese it comes with isn't so great. The Whiskey poppers are awesome. 
They have an OK selection of local beers. Wish they had more. The upstairs outside patio is really great in the summer time. Good size bar with tvs and areas around the bar to hang out. 
One thing I hate about this place is their policy for taking reservations on football Sunday. It's pretty ridiculous. They won't take a reservation for noon or later. So if I want to reserve a table for 6 I have to have everyone there at like 11:45 to get a reservation. That really makes zero sense. Why can't I reserve the table at 1:00? Or even 12:30. I don't get it."}
{"text":"Won't be going back to whiskey warehouse...

Where do I begin? This is the second negative experience I have had and what is worse than that is the managers response on both occasions.

The first experience was me asking for more butter with my meal. When I received my bill there was a charge for extra butter.  When asking the manager why I was charged he said he was new and it was \"company policy\".
Really, to charge for butter?? Should I ask before asking for more ice, salt/pepper???


The second time I was there ordering dinner again and decided on an entree. When ordering I ask if I could do a different side (something other than what the entree came with) she said sure what would you like? So I sub'd the rice and kale seed mix for a house salad and Mac n cheese. 
The salad arrived first and was not cold - more room temp which is not the way I prefer a salad but waited on the entree to arrive hoping it would be better. 
The food was \"ok\" bar food and nothing to give a raving review on. Just \"ok\".

I get the bill and was shocked again to see (sub house salad $3 - sub Mac n cheese $2. 
I ask the bar staff and was told \"yeah it's on the menu, do you want a manager?\"
Yes that would be great!

He shows up with an attitude from the beginning saying \"it's company policy\" and \"it's on the menu\".
I ask - Why wouldn't a server mention this?
\"It's on the menu\". 

I said this is the second bad experience have had here with feeling like 1) if there is an up charge please do me the courtesy of telling me AND most importantly I have NEVER been treated this way by two different restaurant managers from the same location in such a negative way. 

No - \"I'm sorry. Let me take care of this for you this time but please be aware of the up-charges going forward.\" Nothing!! 

I guess it's \"company policy\" to not be nice and courteous to the customer here. I will not be returning ever bc of the managers attitude and the \"company policies\" that Whiskey Warehouse has.
Good luck!"}
{"text":"This place became the new hot spot in Charlotte. On weeknights you will find a very chill crowd with not a lot of crazies out. You can enjoy a beer with friends, have some dinner, and go home happy and buzzed. Weekends, however, have turned into some what of a Charlotte nightlife nightmare. What was supposed to be (I am assuming) a chill atmosphere quickly turns into something you would find at Black Finn (without the dancing). If you're into that sort of stuff (which I am) then it's great, but if you're not, I think you'd be better off going to Thomas Street, which has a less crowded scene."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. Great atmosphere...love the upper deck. The appetizers are good. I highly  recommend the Buffalo Chicken Dip. However, do not expect quick, attentive service. It isn't happening. Also, I ordered the special, sirloin steak, medium rare and got medium well. I'll try this place again because I want to like it but it maybe a place you just settle for drinks & apps."}
{"text":"Let me be clear from the outset, the food is not great. The Barballo chicken wings are the best thing on the menu... That said, we love this place. Only go to the \"Top Shelf\" deck and generally from the outside stairs. The deck and the staff have a nice buzz..... and so do I after the 1/2 off wine on thursday. The deck is head and shoulders above ( literally and figuratively)  everything else in Midwood. service comes with genuine smiles, and they actually know what they are doing. Great deck, veiw, people watching....enjoy"}
{"text":"Looking for a cool spot to socialize, eat amazing food, and enjoy a great beverage? Whiskey Warehouse has it all. Yes, it is a bar with bar food, but it's the best bar and food off of Plaza. TV's float the room in the downstairs area with an old pub feel. Im not a whiskey drinking, but they are known for their whiskey liquor selection; Hence the name, \"Whiskey Warehouse.\" On nice days in Charlotte the patio upstairs is open with a full bar and TV's which over looks downtown Charlotte. Love the atmosphere and the food. I don't think I have ever eaten anything bad on their menu. My boyfriend and I always tend to go to Whiskey when we are in that undecided mood because we never know what we want to eat, like any relationship. On Sundays they have a Bloody Mary bar which is awesome! Grab a shot from the bar and mix your own drink! How cool is that? I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun, cool spot!"}
{"text":"Chealsea was our server. She was amazing and funny too. Always made sure we were good to go as well as attending to everyone else. It was crazy busy but she never showed anything but a smile."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this off by saying - to be fair, I came here after an event that was partially sponsored by this place, therefore it was SUPER busy. And from what I experienced, there wasn't a ton of parking, which is always annoying.

Because it was super busy - our service was pretty terrible & I feel like they could have prepared better, knowing there would be a rush of people coming in. I think on a more \"regular\" night, the service might be better & I'll for sure give them a second chance.

After waiting over an hour for my food (a salad), the order was wrong (I asked for two things to be removed & they were not) and the food was just sub-par.

One really GREAT thing about Whiskey Warehouse is their roofdeck...amazing view of the Charlotte Skyline! I plan to go back some night this summer & give them a second chance & enjoy the rooftop scenery!"}
{"text":"Everything appeared wonderful until I bit into a piece of cardboard, and my night began to spiral down hill :("}
{"text":"Not impressed. Food was alright but do not go here on game day to eat and drink. Took almost two hours to get 1 salad, a burger, and waffles and chicken. When asked what was going on, we were told it is busy and they have a small kitchen. Food then came out cold, to which we were told they had been really backed up. I understand things busy but mgmt should anticipate a crowd on game days and be ready to provide service in a decent time frame, not lame excuses."}
{"text":"If you go, get their wings. My favorite are the Barballo (spelling?). Some of my favorite I've had around town. Their salads are pretty good as well. Sweet potato fries hit the spot. Veggies burger is very run of the mill however. Wait staff are always really nice and easy going. Food takes a LONG time to come out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I love whiskey warehouse it's a nice change of pace for plaza Midwood. I generally really like the crowd that comes... The food is great, the waitresses are super friendly and the drink prices are awesome. The only reason for the four stars is the parking is really terrible!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was skeptical when Whiskey Warehouse opened in the neighborhood where I live and work. I expected it to be a typical redneck sports bar kind of place full of obnoxious drunk people.

However, being that it's across the street from my office, it was so convenient that I really couldn't avoid checking it out. I ventured in a few times with friends for drinks and appetizers, and I never had a bad experience. (Well, okay, once the service wasn't fantastic in the upstairs \"Top Shelf\" roof bar.)

Last night, I was there for dinner with a companion for the first time. The service was very friendly, but they were out of the first bottle of wine we ordered, and then it took forever to get our meal. We weren't really in a hurry, so it wasn't a big deal, and when dinner came (tender, juicy ribs, perfectly seasoned cole slow, and crisp, delicious sweet potato fries) it was quite wonderful.

Here's the stunner. Even though we hadn't complained about the wait at all, our server notified the manager, Johnnalyn, of the situation, and she came right over to our table to apologize (explaining about the small kitchen size) and offer us a gift card for our next meal. Then came the bigger stunner. When our tab arrived, we had not been charged for our meal.

So here's why five stars. This is a restaurant that could get away with mediocre food and service, but instead delivers on both ends...including local food offerings (which I always appreciate) and the most professional and courteous management I've seen in a long time."}
{"text":"Bartenders are super nice here, Great roof top views, Good food at a reasonable price, They always ask your name and tell you theirs, They then remember your name throughout your whole visit!

Oh did I mention they have Whiskey, and they pour heavy!  We just moved to Charlotte, we've been here 3 times already, we think it's our new spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to whiskey warehouse after reading reviews and guess what....
We waited an hour for food after asking 3 times.  We also had to ask for drinks more than once.
The manager said it was being plated. He brought it up and it was cold.  All of our meals were cold.  The manager offered to replace but we were starving so we ate the meat.  He said he would comp or table tonight then tried to  charge us for drinks we ordered while waiting.  We were appalled when he came to the table and said \"your going to tell me what your doing with your meal\"  He then threw his hand up and said get out of here.  When we asked his name he followed us to the door saying his name.
I have never been treated so disrespectful in my life."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before hitting up Whiskey Warehouse and wasn't entirely sure what to expect.  On the one hand, a place that purports to specialize in bourbons and whiskeys and conveniently has a vegetarian menu; on the other hand, reports of a sports bar vibe and a fratty clientele.  Hm.

Still, my brother is a big bourbon drinker and wanted to give it a try.  We rolled in around 8:30 on a Saturday night and were able to snatch a booth with a good view of the USC/Florida game.  Our server was perky and did her best to be helpful but admitted she wasn't much of a bourbon drinker.  She was, however, chatty and amply cleavaged, and given the crowd, the noise, and the TVs, seemed to be appropriate for the type of clientele WW apparently wants to service.  (And, yes, it's true - the clientele was decidedly frat-tastic.)

What I really wanted from WW was a dark, more intimate, saloony-style place, perhaps with servers who actually knew what they were serving and with management who cared more about the whiskey than about the game.  Unfortunately, Whiskey Warehouse is just another generic sports bar dressed up as a concept bar.  Meh."}
{"text":"Go to spot in Plaza. Upbeat vibes downstairs. Great Uptown view on the rooftop. And the best bartenders (Anna will hook you up!). Good game watching spot."}
{"text":"Fun music, good late night pretzel I didn't need, great crowd, service could be bettered by having more staff so the servers aren't rubbing around insane though. Overall really good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here for the first time a few days ago, and it was a pleasant experience. 
We sat on the rooftop (it's a good view but it is a little bit obstructed by trees). It was a hot day, but they had fans out there that kept us cool.
The service was good, and the food was awesome. I only give it 4 stars due to it being really slow - which we normally don't mind, but it wasn't busy at all and it took 15 minutes for me to get my Bloody Mary. 
But other than that, our experience was great. I recommend getting the chicken nachos, and definitely try their Mac & Cheese - It's worth the $2 extra dollars."}
{"text":"While visiting a friend last week in Charlotte we decided to get a drink and some food at Whiskey Warehouse!  I would call it a mid to high end sports bar/restaurant.  It has a really great rooftop bar that has heat lamps, umbrellas and a ton of huge screens for watching any popular sports game (some might like that more than me).  

The bartenders were very nice and super efficient.  The food on the other hand took forever!  They did warn us that it would take 30 minutes for food but it took closer to an hour.  It was fine, just gave us more time to drink booze but I don't know if I would go back to eat, maybe just get a drink.  Great view of downtown too!"}
{"text":"Excellent wings and an absolutely gorgeous upstairs outdoor patio that has an amazing view of the city."}
{"text":"The best chicken nachos ever! Everything was so fresh! Comes with sour cream & salsa!!! Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"Whiskey Warehouse has a gorgeous interior, a great concept, but terrible food and service, and management that just doesn't seem to care. I went in with a group of friends for lunch at 11am on a Saturday- we were the only customers in the place. It took over an hour for us to receive our food. At least 12 people who came in after us (and two who even came in after we ordered) received their food before we did. Despite numerous inquiries, we didn't even get an apology out of the server or management. I'd eaten there once before and the shrimp kabob had been pretty decent, but the turkey burger several of us got was dry and tasteless, and they served me a side of chopped onions and peppers as the \"vegetable of the day\". Onions and peppers are what you cook vegetables in! Others in our party received their food cold, ironic after how long we waited. There are just too many good restaurants in the area for me to EVER go back there again. Sticking with Thomas St Tavern from now on!"}
{"text":"The food sounded pretty good, but we never found out. We sat, ignored, for about 20 minutes before walking out. 

We sat on the upstairs patio and were summarily ignored after being handed menus. The only attention we received was when we finally started walking back down the stairs, hungry and parched. But too little, too late. There are plenty of great restaurants in the neighborhood (with great service), don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Been there a few times. Great bar, and the food is really good - especially the mac-n-cheese!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here trying to figure out how old the French fries are that are supposed to be the base of this \"pouting\"...  and I'm guessing they're pretty old.  I'll let them know when/if they ask."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for three years and just recently discovered this place.  I love the rooftop bar and my boyfriend likes the cool mist of water they spray out on customers when it's hot out (don't worry you won't get wet).

I've never had a bad meal or bad service, no matter how busy the place gets. I can't say that about many restaurants in Charlotte.  They do get packed on Friday and Saturday nights but as long as you don't mind fighting for tables or bar space you'll still enjoy."}
{"text":"Fish & Chips was good.  Decent menu selection, decent prices."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for drinks with friends and always had decent service - not good, just ok. Finally tried their wings because I've always heard how great they are, and I was so disappointed! The flavors were fine, but the wings were soggy and flabby. I ate a few of them and didn't even bother to take the rest home."}
{"text":"I know, I know; \"Good menu selection\" or \"Holy cow, amazing\" may not necessarily be the first thoughts that pop into mind when you think of Whisky Warehouse. But to my wonderful surprise, there's far more stacking up in this kitchen window than just good 'ol Jim Beam.

 I'm so pleased to say that its name actually doesn't do this joint a bit of justice; aside from an awesome bar scene, dining area and fabulous upstairs patio, the food is the real \"worker\" of this warehouse.

With everything on its expansive menu from traditional Carolina classics like pulled pork and chicken dishes smothered in sweet, honey-glazed BBQ sauce, to popular appetizers like the,Whiskey handmade Pimento cheese poppers, hand battered and fried to perfection, all the way to the Creme Brie Chicken, a unique sandwich topped with cinnamon-grilled pineapple, maple syrup, Brie and candied walnuts,(um, yum) Whisky Warehouse is a Plaza Midwood \"hit.\"

And as if that wasnt enough of a well-rounded selection to tempt even the pickiest of eaters, they take it even one step further by offering an assortment of awesome vegetarian dishes. Who wouldn't love the Commonwealth Pasta made of whole wheat noodles, veggies and Parmesan tossed in a light, creamy sauce? Literally, whatever you're hungry for, you can find.

However, the dish that takes this cake and gets all of my thanks and praises has to be the \"Elvis;\" a burger even the King himself would be proud of. Served with lettuce, tomato and home cut Whisky fries, this monster patty is stacked with American cheese, bacon and PEANUT BUTTER.
 Yes, you read that right; the crazy combination of the juice from the burger, mixed with the creaminess of the melted cheese and saltiness from the bacon and PB, it's a combination that can only be deemed \"genius\". Well done, Chef Sam. 

Be sure and check this spot out the next time Happy Hour rolls around, the family is in town visiting or for another perfect sunny Charlotte day on the patio. The bartenders, servers and managers have been nothing but as friendly and attentive as they could be. What more could you possibly want in a restaurant? They're the real deal, y'all."}
{"text":"WHISKY WAREHOUSE!! Hard to beat!

If you've ever had salmon, I promise that the \"Bourbon Butter Salmon Served with rice and vegetables at $13.00 will be the best salmon you've eaten at any price.  If you've never had salmon, once you try this dish, you'll be hooked.

I took a buddy there today and He had the Salmon on a mixed green salad.  His reaction was \"this is way too delicious to be healthy\".

No lie, I've had this dish on at least 10 different ocassions.  It gets better every time. 

Oh! almost forgot, the Mack & Cheese (what??) and the Chicken Fingers that I got for my daughter are apt for a kid any size.  It was really \"yumi\" to quote her.  But mommy ate half. 

Don't forget to give props to SAM the chef on the way out."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Awesome staff, great specials and solid bar food.  One of the best spots to grab a drink and watch a game."}
{"text":"My  husband and I decided to come here last Sunday, since we heard the upstairs roof patio was awesome.......it definitely did not let down!!!

What an incredible view of the city! There are tv's all around the bar so you can watch a game and just enjoy the weather. 

I ordered the mimosa ($2 on Sunday or $4 for a doube.....of course you have to get the double) and my husband ordered an OMB beer. They didnt have a ton of draft selections up there, but I am assuming their selection downstairs was larger. Nice champagne to OJ (aka 2/3 champagne) pour! I also ordered the chorizo sandwich with sweet potato fries. It had a fried egg and jack cheese on top. Very good!

It was fairly busy but we were able to find two seats at the bar. Will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Two things I absolutely love in this world: whiskey and rooftop patios. Clearly, I was destined to end up at Whiskey Warehouse at some point during my Charlotte visit. 

The rooftop has a great environment and view, service isn't bad, and the drinks are abundant, especially those pitchers! Any of them with whiskey were my favorites, but I probably don't need to tell you that twice. Great to share with a few friends and really just enjoying a beautiful spring night in Charlotte. 

As with most rooftop patios, it got packed really quickly here (and probably does on most nights) so be ready to wait for a table to open up."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place for football. The TVs and sound system are fantastic and there isn't a bad seat in the house. The food is great and reasonably priced too. I really enjoy the wing flavors i tried, but they could be a little spicier and saucier for me, but thats just how i like my wangz, y'allI. I tried the buffalo and the habanero mango flavors, both were delicious. Service is fantastic and the servers are very easy on the eyes. I love tights and yoga pants!"}
{"text":"Well, after 10 minutes of waiting at the bar for the bartender to acknowledge my existence, I decided to leave.  She was talking to one guy the whole time, there were 5-6 people sitting at the bar---she wasn't swamped."}
{"text":"Wonderful burgers!! Friends got the wings and really enjoyed them as well. They also have great fries. Every time I've been, service has been good. Nice low key place with good food."}
{"text":"It's TOO LOUD TO THINK! This place would be better if you could have a conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"On Monday of the holiday weekend, we visited Whiskey Warehouse in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte. This rustic looking pub has an industrial feel built into a sports bar with many TV's and a large rooftop patio. 

We started with the Brussel sprouts appetizer, cooked in a white wine, garlic and parmesan reduction topped with bacon jelly. We are really not sprouts fans, but we gave them a try and were not disappointed. They were roasted, smoky and the bacon jelly could easily get addictive. Dora here. Still not a sprouts fan, but this appetizer is a great way to entice kids, er...adults to eat their veggies. That bacon's like candy!

Since May was National Burger Month, we ordered burgers. I selected the Elvis Burger, topped with peanut butter, bacon and cheese. Now I am a peanut butter lover but have never thought about adding it to a burger but will in the future. This burger was large, juicy, and tasted great. You could taste the peanut butter, but it was not overwhelming and blended together perfectly.

Dora here. Based on our friendly server's recommendation, I ordered the Bistro Burger, topped with caramelized onions, Brie cheese, bacon and a horseradish dijon aioli. Oh my stars! This juicy burger wowed me with robust flavor, the sweetness from the Brie and onions calling out for more bites until all I had left was an empty plate. The hand-cut fries were a perfect accompaniment, and finally, a restaurant that passed my iced tea test with an A+! Adding Whiskey Warehouse to our \"must return\" list.

I would rate this establishment 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.

{"text":"I had my doubts about this place from the beginning, but since it was suggested by another person in our fairly large party, I decided not to be difficult and go. 

We arrived at 8:30 on a Friday night. The wait was OK considering we had 9 in our group. They do have a cozy waiting section in the corner, filled with plush couches and chairs, however it's not a very intimate spot. The music was so loud and the couches were so far apart everyone in the group ended up shouting across the space just to have a conversation. 

The wait staff, hostesses and bartenders we all very friendly and quick to offer up something to drink. The food was ... OK. Not the worst I've had, but certainly not the best. I got the grilled cheese - it was as expected. The fries were very good. Two friends got burgers, who said they were decent, and another two friends got the steak kabobs, which received mediocre reviews. 

The other patrons weren't quite as fratty as I was expecting from reading previous reviews on here, but I can see where they were going with it. No Affliction or Ed Hardy tees in sight ..."}
{"text":"Cool vibe, especially on their rooftop. Food was a little disappointing with no flavor. Monday's happy hour wing special is a good deal!"}
{"text":"So this was my first time here , we walked in saw a giant cockroach on the stairs. Went up to the patio to eat and drink , halfway through our meal we saw another giant cockroach ON OUR FOOD. Then we saw two more under our chairs. We first spoke to the waitress and she told us that it's normal because we are outside. We then asked for the manager and he also told us it was normal and there's nothing they can do about it because we were outside. They only discounted $5 off of our $60 dollar tab that we didn't finish because we were disgusted. After we paid our waitress simply told us to \"have a good one\" and walked away. We are still disgusted since we saw a total of 6 cockroaches one of them being literally in our boneless wing. DONT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Stopped in here randomly while exploring Plaza Midwood.  Parking is around back, but fills up quickly.  Good drink selections, menu is simple and concise, and the Chicken Pasta was absolutely incredible! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"With the name Whiskey Warehouse, I wasn't sure what to expect. But who cares b/c I loved it! The inside is a huge area full of tables along with a little lounge area with cushy seats and ottomans plus tv's everywhere you look. The service was great plus you can't beat beers for $2 and $3 along with a selection of pretty much every whiskey or scotch under the sun. They have a dj playing current tunes along with the early 90's jams that we all love so. Oddly enough, it seemed louder outside than inside but oh well, it was a great time.  Parking is a bit scarce in their lot but you can always look at the lots off Thomas Street and off street parking or keep an eye out for the cabs strolling by there every five minutes---lifesavers I tell you.  I will be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Came here with Friends for Drinks and Food. The Wings were decent. Defiantly more of a causal environment and laid back feel."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ask for Martha behind the bar! Sometimes they're a little slow on sundays for brunch especially upstairs, but they managers are very accommodating for any troubles. One of the best views of the city! Perfect summer hangout spot! $4 jack specials are always a reason to come back! This place is a second home!"}
{"text":"the current reviews back up my review I did over a year ago....in a neighborhood w/as many great bars as P-Wood has, WHY would anyone bother coming here?...although as it IS a landing point for every poser-ey douchebag & pretty person in a 10 mile radius, maybe we SHOULD encourage its existence so they can all flock here and stay out of the good bars in the area...so if you're reading this and from the 28210-28211-28207 zip code, WW is the greatest bar ever invented by man or God....."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars from me. We have been here 3 times this year and each time it has been great, great atmosphere to celebrate my hubbys bday. Great servers and drinks too"}
{"text":"My husband and I are Bourbon enthusiasts, and we have wanted to check out this place for a long time. We were in the area on Saturday and finally took the opportunity to check this one off our list. We started our order with a Jefferson flight that included Jefferson Small Batch, Jefferson Reserve, and Jefferson Ocean.  It was $17.  I've been curious about Jefferson Ocean, but never wanted to fork over $100 for a whole bottle without tasting it first.  IMHO, bourbon doesn't have to cost a small fortune to be great.  I'm glad I waited because I preferred the taste of the Small Batch best. We also ordered a Jack & Coke, which were on special for $4.  It was a perfectly balanced cocktail.  The coke was sweet, and the Jack wasn't watered down or too strong.  (You would think it would be simple enough to never get wrong, but many bars do.). In case you aren't a whiskey fan, they also had double Mimosas and Bloody Mary's on special for $5. 

I ordered the BBQ pork plate. The meat was moist and seasoned well. It does have some heat to it, but not so much that it overpowered the taste of the pork.  I didn't try the slaw, but it was well presented and looked good. I substituted Mac-n-cheese for fries, and they came out hot and crispy.  My hubby ordered the fish and chips, and he was also very happy with his food.  He said the fish was moist and well seasoned. 

What really impressed us about this place was the exception customer service we received. Our server patiently answered our questions and checked back frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. It was a very pleasant experience and we will definitely go back for the Saturday specials!"}
{"text":"We visited the Whiskey Warehouse for the first time this past Sunday night.  Parking wasn't ideal (or well-defined), but we found a spot (or made our own).  Upon entering, we were impressed by the look, atmosphere, and wide-open space of the restaurant.  It was very inviting, fun, and alive with energy.  Our server was great, too, and she reminded me a bit of Rachael Ray -- both in her smile and her voice.  

We got a great booth on the side of the restaurant (although I would have also have been happy at one of their several high-tops.)  I ordered a Bratwurst Sandwich from the \"Local Food Section\" of the menu.  For $1 extra, I substituted sweet potato fries for regular.  The bratwurst was delicious, topped with grilled onions and peppers, and so full of flavor.  It was just the right size, too, so I didn't feel overstuffed.  My partner on the other hand ordered the Southern Chicken sandwich -- a fried chicken breast with pimento cheese and bacon.  It was freakin' HUGE and a damn good value.  He couldn't even finish it all.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, too!

I also enjoyed watching the drunk sports fanatic at the table next to us who moved in very slow motion and tried to hold his head up the whole time we were there.  He was quite entertaining. 

Lastly, if you're into whiskey (unfortunately, I'm not), they have a fantastic selection of brands for you to try.   

We'll definitely return for a fun, casual night out.  I'd love to try their upstairs, outdoor seating/bar when it warms up again."}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood place to chill with friends or grab a good meal. I'm particularly fond of Sunday's when the bloody mary bar is set up. They've got a lot of TV's set up and play some good music. And ladies...it doesn't have a feel of a sports bar, so no worries there. 

I've had the fish & chips here a few times and it's my go to meal. Not the best I've ever had, but let's be honest...it's fried fish and fried potatoes...score!"}
{"text":"I went there on a friday night with a couple friends and we had some drinks and dinner. I agree that this place pretty much seems outta place with its location and some of the douche bags it appears to draw. Maybe they will draw a better customers in the future but as long as the crowd they have now is spending, then management is probably perfectly ok with them. 

I had the salmon which was delicious and we all shared the nachos app which was pretty spicy but also delicious. I found the beer selection to be moderately priced, maybe leaning a little towards  expensive. I didn't bother with the whiskey menu as that stuff pretty much turns me into a raging asshole. The decor of the place was cozy and it seemed to be laid out fairly well. However, the parking there sucks and we were lucky to get a spot. I'd probably give this place 4 stars but for the time being the frat boy customers look like they've all just graduated from Buckhead Saloon downtown and brought their doucheness to a new venue for display. Go check it out if you've got a chance. I probably wouldn't recommend being a regular though."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try WW for years simply based on the looks of this place. The rooftop patio looks awesome from below and I think it has a view of the great Charlotte skyline. Anyway, I finally found a Saturday to grab lunch there with a friend, and in short, I look forward to my next visit. I ate in this building about 7-8 years ago when it was another restaurant (can't remember the name). The renovation changeover blew me away. I love what they did!! Very rustic and well done with plenty of seating options. It was a tad too cool to eat on the rooftop this day so that will be my next visit. Ok, onto the service and food. The place wasn't that packed so we got a table immediately. The waitress was very nice and we didn't wait long at all to have our orders taken. We each ordered cheeseburgers with fries. Fresh cut fries that is. Anyone that knows me will know hands down that good french fries will get me back for a second visit. WW has those fries. Seasoned just right and fresh tasting. The burgers were very good also even though the meat was a tad dry on mine. The only minor complaint I have was that it took almost a half hour to get our food after we ordered. The waitress kept telling us it would be soon. I definitely won't hold this against them. Even a well run restaurant has a difficult day now and then. Even then, I am usually not in a great hurry on Saturdays so it was ok with me. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Oh Sunday Football!! Only to be made better by the Bloody Mary bar and cheep Mimosa's oh and $2 Bud lights!! They have a map of the floor chart that shows what TV's will be showing what game so you could pick your area out. I thought that was pretty cool considering they have TVs everywhere!! It was fun and close to home!"}
{"text":"Came to have a late lunch during the Panthers game and was disappointed by the poor service.  I know to expect slow service here based on my prior experiences, but today was worse than ever.  First off we were sat and our server didn't come over for over 5 minutes.  We ordered an appetizer of wings with our drinks.  When the server came back with our drinks we ordered our meal.  A while later, we still don't have wings and I see out food just sitting in the window and other servers/the manager just looking at it waiting for our server to come over- ever heard of teamwork? Then our wings come out about 5 min later by the manager who asked if they were supposed to be an app.  When we said yes, he said \"oh\" with no apology or anything.  Also, most of the time we were here he was standing in the corner talking to the group of servers or texting.  Didn't really seem him working.  The food here is good, but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"i can not give a full review on whiskey but from what i had, the good looking waitresses and the atmosphere it makes me want to go back.i did not try any food on my visit. i did like the atmosphere and music being played and its a great place if you like bourbon and whiskey which i do."}
{"text":"Love the rooftop bar. Went inside to eat, took almost an hour to get food and the salmon and fries were cold. Something isn't right here, potential, but need some intervention. Won't be back and won't recommend."}
{"text":"Classic bar food with plenty of tvs for watching. 

We stopped in on a Saturday evening. There was no wait and our food came out quickly. My companions both had the house burger that they were satisfied with. I had the deep fried pimento cheese balls that were listed as homemade, but anytime something comes out in a uniform perfect shape all the way across that statement loses a little bit of credibility. I am talking perfect circle here. That didn't stop me from enjoying them though, they were basically pimento mozzarella sticks and they were great. 

Our waitress was very nice, and everything was reasonably priced. If I were looking for a quick bite to eat in the area or trying to catch a game on I would definitely check it out again.

Update went back with family this weekend and the burger was MASSIVE and delicious!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest....I came in here with pretty low expectations. With a name reminiscent of trashy college bars - I expected a lot less. It's actually like a classy version of a sports bar. We came at six on Friday for dinner after work. It has a great \"chill out\" atmosphere with great music. Also, a ton of tvs, extensive whiskey selection, and good service. The buffalo chicken dip was awesome. The wings were fall off the bone juicy, but the brisket was flat, dry, and overcooked. It did have really good flavor though."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype!!! My wife and I stopped in with a few friends for some food and drinks, and the first impressions of this place is good. But that's as good as it gets. The only goal of this establishment is to take your money and in return you receive bad service. They blatantly over serve alcohol to a lot of patrons. But it gets worse, when we were able to finally submit a food order it was taken in a very unprofessional manner. Then the entrees were brought out before our appetizer, I tried to speak to the waitress about it but her response was to roll her eyes and walk off. So I requested to speak to the manager. When the manager arrived he already was very defensive and was in a foul mood. I asked him why our food came out in the order it did and his response was \" be happy you got your food!!\" At that point I explained to him that is not how you treat customers and that we are leaving, his response was just walking off! So as you can see don't waste your valuable time and money."}
{"text":"Usually I love Whiskey Warehouse but recently the food hasn't been the greatest. Ordered something and was told it'd be about 15 minutes. Waited at the bar almost 30 minutes to get my food. I got all the way home when I realized it was completely messed up.... when it's all I've wanted all day long. Not worth the time to go back, especially when it's so late and I'm exhausted from working all day. Prepare for subpar service if you go here."}
{"text":"This place is 5 stars in my book.  Always a decent drink special, good bar food, plenty of TVs, and an awesome rooftop bar with a nice view of Uptown.  The service has always been good too.  Whiskey is always an option when we're out and about in Midwood looking for a drink."}
{"text":"Sit upstairs on the patio during nice weather and enjoy the view and wings!  Ribs are great too."}
{"text":"Waitresses got GREAT tits. Service slow AF doe! But them titties bouncing almost makes up for it."}
{"text":"You really have to know what time and day to visit a particular venue in Charlotte, especially one like this which at any given moment can be a family restaurant, a sports bar or a pickup joint.  

When it's not full of yahoos, it's a really nice place from my experience today.  I got the Warehouse Burger and wasn't crazy about the BBQ sauce which tasted more like wing sauce (tart 'n spicy instead of rich 'n smoky).  But it was perfectly cooked and the bacon was crisp and tasty.  The waitress was attentive and knowledgeable.  And most importantly, true to their name, they have an obvious, albeit expensive selection of bourbon, whiskey and whisky that covers all the bases.

I'd give them four stars if they got rid of all the flat screen TV's and were in a location more suitable to the clientele that enjoys eating and drinking what's on their menu.  If we're lucky, when something else trendy and new opens up in PM, WW will mature into a really great spot.  Time will tell, so stay thirsty my friends..."}
{"text":"Whiskey Warehouse is a great drinking spot, especially for day drinking. They have the best rooftop patio in the city. Unfortunately, it is the best rooftop in the city so get there at opening time or be prepared to sit inside/stand around waiting to steal a seat as it is first come first served. 

I came here to eat last week for the first time. I usually only go here for the drinks. There was a wait but we eventually got sat. They informed us that they were giving us the new menu but they hadn't actually started serving the new menu so we should ask our server about something if we were interested. Thought that was weird... Why not just wait to put out the new menus?

They were out of a few of the beers we wanted. Ended up getting a pretty good one I had never had before. I got a steak wedge salad medium rare and it came out the steak was cold. Not just room temp but cold. Everyone else at the table had gotten something fried so my guess is that mine sat out for awhile. I hate complaining but couldn't eat it so let me server know. They must've microwaved it and brought it right back out and it was well done. I was pretty shocked they would do that. I asked for more steak and finally got it right. Chewy steak though not worth getting. 

My server was great. The food wasn't so great."}
{"text":"Every Thursday is prime rib night. Fantastic price and good quality.  Queen cut around $12 and King's cut 14. Great rooftop bar over looking the CLT"}
{"text":"I stopped by their space on Saturday evening at the Brewer's Ball  for the Cystic Fibrosis foundation. They brought some sort of ribs as well as  Pimento cheese with corn chips.  Of course, since I don't partake in beef or pork, I passed on the ribs. But, I sampled their pimento cheese with chips.  It was made the way I like it, meaning its really cheesy, you can't really detect the mayo, and it had a slight kick."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! I'm a huge pimento cheese fan, and the whiskey poppers (fried balls of pimento cheese) were everything! Service was excellent, and the prices are very reasonable. We did not eat on the rooftop patio due to ridiculously hot weather, but we did check it out and it looks awesome for a summer night! I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great Wings and Great Drinks! Roof top service is on point. My regular Monday night stop!"}
{"text":"We really like the rooftop bar here. In a strange kind of way, they have different beer selections upstairs and downstairs, so you might have to go up and down. While we loved the open air rooftop, the downstairs is rather dark and dingy during the day."}
{"text":"It's a shame this place is getting such poor reviews.  I had a great experience here last Thurs. night the staff was more than friendly and how can you beat half priced wine by the glass or bottlev-that will bring me back any night.

I enjoyed the atmosphere and my whiskey shots.  I think this is a great place to bring a group for some cocktails.   This place has a lot of potential can't wait to come back and check out the menu and some more whiskey."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous service at Whisky Warehouse! GABBY is an amazing server and incredibly friendly. Make sure you ask for her!!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. After waiting for almost 45 minutes for a burger we got our order to go."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday for lunch and wanted to sit on the rooftop because the weather was beautiful. Unfortunately the rooftop isn't open durning the week until dinner time. Food is good but would have been nice to enjoy the nice weather and beautiful scenery the restaurant can but didn't offer."}
{"text":"Not much of a bar person as I find the noise level ridiculously loud and one ends up screaming to have a conversation, but to my friend's suggestion I decided to go anyway and chill. Well I was not surprised but what really turned me off were those awful things they served; the dreaded chicken wings. How can anyone \"eff up\" chicken wings. These were unsavory and the garlic Parmesan are not to be bothered with. Go for the social atmosphere and have a brew/pint but leave it to just that only."}
{"text":"My New Favorite Bar in Charlotte....

What's not to like about this spot? Whiskey Warehouse is the rare bar that perfectly mixes the concoction of bar, food, screens, service, patio-area/view and overall ambiance that make any bar worth going to.

Bar: Every time I've been here they have had some sort of beer special; from $2 bud lites, to $3 micro brews, to $4 Jack Daniels you-call-its.  R.B.V.s are also reasonably priced around $18 for two, which is more than straight.

Food:  I can honestly say this place has some of the best bar food anywhere in Charlotte - for real.  I have eaten here multiple times and everything I have had has been awesome.  I recently had the Monterrey Chicken Sandwich, which I can say was hands-down one of the best chicken sandwiches I have ever had - every sandwich should have pepper-jack cheese and guacamole!  I have also had the wings here on multiple occasions.  The wings always come well sauced, meaty, well cooked, and with a cold, thick ranch.  If you've read my other reviews, then you know how important it is to me that they char their wings.  That's right folks, the wings are thrown on a grill for a min before they bring them out to you.  I had the chance to eat brunch here last Sunday, and I have to stay I was thoroughly impressed.  The toast was a little undercooked, but otherwise the scrambled eggs and bacon were up to par.  

Screens: I love the fact that they have plenty of television screens littered and hanging from every corner of this bar.  Even when you go upstairs to the gorgeous rooftop patio, they have plenty of television screens embedded within the bar area.   

Patio/View: Speaking of the rooftop patio - @ WW you will find nothing short of the most SPECTACULAR and BREATHTAKING VIEW OF THE CHARLOTTE SKYLINE anywhere!  There is plenty of seating and they have full waitress and bar service.  I also appreciate the H20 mist they have cooling down the patrons at the bar.  Though BEWARE fellas, many ladies are leery of the mist interacting with their hair!

Service:  Great service.  My order has always been correct each time I've ordered food or drinks.   I am preferential to the bar staff simply because of easier access to drinks, and closer views of the television screens.  

I've tried to come up with something not to like about this place and I can't.  Prices are reasonable.  Though tight, they do indeed have a parking lot.  I meant what I said to start this review, I love Whiskey Warehouse, its my new favorite bar in Charlotte and I will def be back - hope to see you there!

PS: FYI: Monday WW has 1/2 price wings.  They serve brunch on Sunday's starting at 11am!  $3 bloody Mary's on SUNDAYS!!!"}
{"text":"ROLL TIDE! I am a frequent customer her on Saturdays in the fall. There are always games on the tvs, drinks flowing, and great food being served. I live within walking distance and I always have a great time here. The Bloody Mary bar is the BEST in Charlotte and you can't beat their chicken and waffles. Burgers are good, lemon pepper wings are great! Service can be slow during busy times, which is expected but overall I always have a great experience. Plus their rooftop is amazing!! The views of the city are beautiful!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place thinking it looked like a nice place to spend our one warm evening of the month. It sucked. Waited 45+ mins for a drink and for some soggy fries and a terrible cold \"chicken buffalo wrap\" it was probably the worst food I've had since moving to Charlotte. The one saving grace was that the bartenders were cool and comped our food caused they realized how much it sucked."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday, severely understaffed. I waited 20 minutes at the bar and doesn't even get a hello. Decided to go across the street and got prompt service."}
{"text":"great rooftop bar with nice views of Charlotte's skyline"}
{"text":"Love this place. Can relax and have a couple beers while having quality food instead of the typical pub grease burgers."}
{"text":"We had a late lunch there today around 3pm. It was slow in the restaurant and the staff was all friendly and very chatty. Could've been somewhat faster service but it wasn't terribly slow. The buffalo chicken sandwich was good- the buffalo sauce was very peppery and delicious."}
{"text":"First let me say, I have never eaten here. I have visited multiple times for drinks and views in the evening and have been there once during the day for cocktails. The environment fits in with plaza with a typically prep pier leaning crowd for the area. I love the rooftop and the views it has. Limited parking is available on a pull through drive next to it. But is very very rare. Most visits I did not notice the staff or service meaning it was totally fine and not noteworthy. Sadly, this last visit, the staff was extremely disappointing. I went last Friday around 4pm. I sat on the roof with a dozen coworkers. Although there were 3-5 staff/bartenders at the bar the entire 2 hours we were there and around 4 other patrons, it's took 5-15 minutes to get any of their attention. They were standing within 6 feet of us and when we would come up to the bar, none of them would male eye contact. Eventually a blonde server would usually help us, reluctantly. She seemed very annoyed by all requests. 

I will continue to patron here for late nights but do not plan to hang out here when I'm looking to be treated nicely and timely."}
{"text":"The bartender Jess is a total bitch. After I was speaking to a patron who, according to Jess, comes in \"everyday\" and assumed I was harassing the patron. She threatened me with being kicked out for literally nothing. Look at her face and you will see that natural bitch look. Ugh. News flash Jess, you're not hot. Oh and you're in the service industry. No tip, no potential."}
{"text":"Been here many times and love the rooftop patio views! Came with some friends for the Alabama game and sat at the downstairs bar.  This experience was just ok - we were served beers in hot (fresh from the dryer) glasses which made them immediately warm :-/ The nachos were just alright and the buffalo wrap left a lot to be desired.  Great for a fun atmosphere with friends, but not the best food."}
{"text":"This is a bar you'll want to visit to watch a game. There are plenty of tv's. 

But, we all thought visit for the first half and get an appetizer. The nachos were a small plate for the price but were very good. 

Other meals are pricy and others were saying the meals weren't that great.

Lots of whiskey ... of course. Pretty extensive selection.

It was too cold to go to the rooftop area. But, we'll be back to check that aspect out and try some other appetizers."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a shot for brunch but it let me down. The wait was long and there were open tables just not being cleaned. The food took forever and came out burnt. The wait staff was very rude and did not seem to care about their customers that were dining. Very disappointed in the overall experience at this establishment."}
{"text":"Christy was very friendly! Got the cucumber mango mowscow mule for $11 and was well worth it and I'm a dive bar drinker lol"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place to watch a game, and usually they have some pretty great drink specials. Super disappointed in the food lately. It used to be great, but then they changed the menu and everything seems cheap, poor presentation and they skimp on ingredients. Usually get the nachos and was extremely disappointed. Over 1/2 the chips had nothing on them. It was basically a a few pieces of chicken, tomatoes and some cheese. No salsa. No sour cream. No beans. And for $11! Could've gotten better nachos at Taco Bell for $1. Not sure I will be ordering food here anymore."}
{"text":"Warning: A Sunday funday could end up with you showing your ass to strangers. Not saying, just saying. 

I go here a bunch, no doubt. It is, in my mind, one of THE Charlotte Sunday spots. Beyond the Sundays, a nice view, good beer prices and food that is hit and miss for me. I definitely like it as a bar, just luke warm on the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic rooftop bar with a fantastic view of The Queen City. The seating on the rooftop bar is first come first seated. The servers are friendly. The atmosphere is always bussing with conversation and cocktails."}
{"text":"Food is a total disappointment here. You don't get the quality of food that you are paying for. This is a great place to come grab a drink. If the weather is good the top shelf rooftop bar has great views of Uptown."}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere is freaking fabulous. And I am always surprisingly happy with the food. I didn't expect them to have such good food but they really do! Big portions, good salads, awesome apps. I love that they have $4 Jack every day I mean come on, just for that I'd go. The view is great. The staff is always great. We just love it! Maybe some more fans though it gets hot as hell up there!"}
{"text":"You ever want to not review a place because you fear that other's will find out it's awesome? ... Yeah, I guess that's why I've been holding off on reviewing Whiskey Warehouse. Either that or I'm a procrastinator. Here's the top three reason why Whiskey Warehouse is favored so dearly by me:

1. Wings
The wings are some of the best \"traditional\" wings I've had in Charlotte and I've committed to finding good wings where ever I live. Wings over Everything! Wings (and ball) is Life! ... Anyway, there's a ton of good options in terms of sauce or dry rub. My top three choices are: Lemon Pepper, Parmesan Garlic and BBQ (tangy deliciousness). The wings are meaty and crispy and never disappoint. I usually go for all drums because all wing connoisseurs know the drums are the best.

2. Value / Happy Hour
Love wings but balling on a budget? ... 1/2 price apps Monday through Friday. All the wing goodness, half the price! I guess there's other apps to try but I would stress focusing on the wings. .. Love whiskey! Of course you do! What else would you down your wings with? ... Well my friend / stranger reading this review there's $4 Jack Daniels drinks just for you (or anybody else with $4). Can't go wrong there. There's tons of other great whiskey to pick from at a very reasonable price.  

3. Brunch on the Patio
Sunday brunch ... you, your friends, a couple of flights of Mimosas for $12 or $2 glasses, a good selection of yummy eats ranging from pancakes to burgers and wings of course. what more could you ask for? ... You: What about a nice view of the Uptown skyline? ... Whiskey Warehouse: I got you fam. ... The patio give you all of that. If it's nice out, it might take you a little bit to grab a really good spot."}
{"text":"Neat atmosphere like an old whiskey saloon inside.  But
the best part is the rooftop bar/eatery with a great city backdrop.  Food was slower than I prefer but to be expected anytime I dine outside.  I ordered the buffalo wrap which was great but the fries were cold.  They gladly accommodated me with new.  Overall I'd be back to eat on the rooftop with a city view.  Price point was affordable as well"}
{"text":"Try the bloody mary bar!"}
{"text":"If you like whiskey and bar food this place is perfect for you. Service is as expected for a bar scene, but the menu makes up for it. The warehouse offers a great selection of American style foods in addition to an adventurous brunch menu. I'd like to see them offer cheaper jack and cokes because they are $4 everywhere else. Trust me, I've traveled, and drank, plenty. Overall a great restaurant for all ages especially post college."}
{"text":"The wings are great, especially on 1/2 off Mondays. The rooftop bar is also great, the 2 flights of stairs help you work off the wings.  
Downside-on weekends they have a DJ and the music volume is VERY VERY loud.  This is a bar/restaurant and in trying to make it into a dance club, the Warehouse loses the appeal of lounge for conversing and sipping a fine drink.  We have to yell so loudly that the person in the next seat can hear pieces of a conversation. As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I can state that the combination of alcohol, yelling over loud music, and trying to hear over loud music causes damage to the vocal cords and hearing abilities."}
{"text":"i've been to this place a few times.  This place is always packed with people but i don't mind.

The thing that we usually get here are their pitchers.  If you come here with a group of friends, the pitcher is what i suggest you should get.  Its a great way to not spend a lot of money and still get your drank game on! The pitchers are relative cheap for the amount of alcohol content you get

This place is a great starter place to come to pregame and bar hop to the next place.
The environment is real chill and they serve some pretty good food that compliments the drinks here

I recommend getting the Jack and Coke pitcher as that is their most popular one.  Also the lemon drop one is pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my meal today. This is what I was served when I ordered garlic parmesan boneless wings.  When I asked my server if this how this dish normally comes out, she said yes. I can't believe they let this leave the kitchen."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks on Saturday afternoon and sat up on the rooftop at the bar. Didn't order food as we had just finished brunch and we're looking for a scenery change. Absolutely enjoyed everything. Had multiple drink specials, all the college games on and had great service with multiple bartenders working. The food looked and smelled good and would definitely try them out for a meal"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weeknight with a friend. We sat on the rooftop area which was amazing because it had a fantastic view. I wouldn't recommend sitting up here though if you are bothered by a light of people standing around drinking and smoking. If you are looking for more relaxed dinner vibes eat inside. Some weeknights I am sure wouldn't be bad but weekends especially it is mostly for the drinking crowd. 
I had the spicy vegetable stir fry and it was good. I am a huge spice fan so I can handle a lot and I felt this was spicy in a way I enjoyed but something others would find overly spicy. Will def. have to come again."}
{"text":"I just remembered that I needed to update my WW review.
The restaurant is still good.  The service is still good.  Not a lot has changed in my thinking out front.
BUT if you are in need of a talented management and staff to be able to help you with a special event, I highly recommend hitting Al and the gang up for use of their back room.
We took Beards BeCAUSE to Whiskey for our inaugural \"No Laughing Matter\" show.  It was a night of stand-up comedy to combat domestic violence.  Yes, I come up with some odd ideas.
The crew at Whiskey were extremely accomodating.  They made it easy for the crowd and servers to communicate without disturbing the comics and offered their full menu.  (I housed the steak and asked for bacon added to my mac and cheese in between shows.)
We comfortably sat about 55 for the first show and 65 for the second.
When the first show ran a little long, the staff was totally on point with turning over the room for the second show.  And they were on the spot with more tables and chairs when the second crowd was larger than the first.
They really helped fine tune my wacky idea and turned it into a fantastic fundraiser.  We look forward to going back every year for this unique fundraiser."}
{"text":"Showed up at 1pm on a Sunday.  Was pretty crowded but the wife and I were the only ones in line so the wait was only ~10 minutes.  Good to go.

I ordered a lunch dish (salmon sandwich). Wife ordered an omelette (vegetarian).  Food took 50 minutes to arrive.  Mine was OK.  Wife's order was f'd up but we were starving after waiting so long, so we let it slide.  Both meals were OK at best.

Will give a second chance at some point, but with so many good choices in the area that can seat and serve in under an hour, I have a half a dozen other places to go that have better than \"OK\" food.

I need to be fair here.  The wait was not unusual as far as I could tell; all those around us that were seated in a similar timeframe took just as long to receive food.  So this place just runs slow.  This is most likely a function of how the kitchen is smaller than the galley in my apartment, despite probably serving ~150 guests at a time.

Best part is food is comparatively cheap vs most brunch spots.

Bottom line: Whiskey FailHouse"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER! Literally. Look at my reviews for other places. The service was terrible. Food too. The server refused to honor the happy hour pricing when I asked for an item to be replaced. That definitely sealed her fate with the tip I left. Additionally, she was nowhere to be found most of my visit. Definitely won't be back. I love when I visit somewhere for dinner for the first time and they leave me with lasting impressions."}
{"text":"What can I say but every experience here has been great! 

My first experience was for lunch and the chicken sandwich was amazing. Unfortunately it is no longer on the menu. My co workers big fish was amazing as well and he gets it most of the time goes.

I have also been here for brunch and oh my it was heaven! My GF and I got the hangover helper and we both enjoyed it tremendously. I would say hold off on the syrup until you tasted it as it was a little over kill. A little to much on the flavor palate. 

The couple with us had a burger and omelet and loved theirs as well. We had the pimento cheese poppers and I was surprised at how great they were. I would say get them at least once. 

Staff had always been friendly and have always been great service.

I go here any chance I get!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the Giants game since it wasn't on at home.  Decided to partake in some $2 mimosas and my friends tried the $3 bloody mary's.  We knew we'd be here for a while so we decided to eat smething right away and then again later.  I had the wings in the barbalo sauce, combo of buffalo and bbq.  They were really good, had a bit of a kick but it evened out w/the sweetness of the bbq sauce.  My friends had fried green tomatoes, which I didn't try but have had them and I really like them, and spinach and atrichoke dip, that was really good too.

After a few hours we decided to eat again and we had grilled cheeses all around.  My nephews had them here once and we all kept stealing bites because it was so good!  I got mac and cheese as a side and the others got fries and sweet potato fries.  Grilled cheese was delish but the sides are not their strong point.  Fries are bit soggy and the mac and cheese was okay, but I didn't find myself digging in like I normally would.

I like it here, the beers are decently priced, its a nice bar, and the staff is pretty good.  I was here early so parking wasn't an issue, but I know it can be.  The clientele was very mixed, there were families, couples out for brunch, some elderly people, plenty of rowdy football fans, but nobody off putting.  All in all I like it here and tend to forget about it.  I will def be back!"}
{"text":"I met a few friends out here last night and really enjoyed my evening. The bartenders were quick and friendly. I enjoyed the DJ's music - nice mix of some new and old school. Of course I drank whiskey. Drink prices were reasonable. There was a good mix of different types of people in the crowd. Not as many \"frat boys\" as others have reviewed.

I did not have any food, but would go back to try it. So my 4 star rating is just for drinks and the evening vibe of the place. 

I would go back."}
{"text":"I had been to whiskey warehouse to meet with friends for a drink but I am writing this review based on my most recent experience. It started out negative but actually ended very positive and I do plan on going back! I was at the front bar trying to get a drink when one of the bar tenders tended to people on either side of me and completely blew me off for almost the whole first quarter of one of the playoff games even when I tried flagging her down multiple times. I had been gone so long my friends had to come look for me because they thought I had left! I never complain about bad service to a manager but this woman had caught me on a bad day. I went and spoke to a bar tender in the back about the situation and she got the manager. I spoke to her about what had happened and she was extremely understanding and comped me a drink. Her and the bartenders at the other bar turned my negative experience to a very positive one and I greatly appreciated it! I would return because of the great service recovery and the fact that I don't want to let one person ruin my experience for an establishment!"}
{"text":"Let's just suppose you are not a fan of having a wide selection of Whiskey, Bourbon, and Scotch at your fingertips that is reasonably priced. Or even if you could care less about an intriguing beer menu of both local an national brands. Maybe you don't even drink alcohol! You should still go to Whiskey Warehouse. The Plaza Midwood location is a neighborhood I love because of the community and the other restaurants and bars in the area, but Whiskey is a little different. Hardwood floors, walls, tables, everything gives it a bare stripped down feeling, but if the wood looks less than comfortable that pop a squat on one of the lush overstuffed leather couches in the corner. The food is fan-freaking-tastic! Wings, ribs, steak, and even great salads and sides for my vegetarian friends. It's never really that crowded, which is perfect because it isn't really that big but somehow gives off a spacious vibe. Maybe it's the high ceilings or giant plasma tv's over the bar. Whiskey is a great place to start or end your night. They have fun events and month long drink specials! \"Home of the $4 Jack Daniels,\" is a great slogan they proudly boast, but I just love it for ambiance, selection, and general merriment."}
{"text":"Love it! Came here with friends to relax and watch the game. Upper patio has a great breeze for these summer nights."}
{"text":"The service is great, they will make sure everything is taken care of for you. The food is great, drinks are awesome and the rooftop view of the city from plaza midwood is priceless. Get there early to grab a seat, it can get crowded during busy evening hours and weekends. Definitely worth it for great vibes and drinks while taking in the view of the city."}
{"text":"i first noticed this place existed yesterday when we were on our way to the Penguin and the stupid bus couldn't decide if it was stopping or not at the Thomas Street light so i had to roll up to the next street where Whiskey Warehouse awaited. We decided to come back and give it a try.  

We really liked the feel of the place, exposed brick walls, whiskey bottle pub tables, plenty of whiskey decor going on. There were a number of tvs but the sound didn't seem to sync with the tvs i was watching. i'm assuming that is something that will be worked out.  

Unfortunately, i have to work today so i couldn't really explore the whiskey or beer options. Waitress said $2 Bud Lights today and $4 Jack everyday i believe. 

So we were there for the food. While not a huge menu, there was enough to choose from with most of the standard fare. Of course, i went with the buffalo chicken wrap ($8) minus tomato. It wasn't bad, the sauce didn't seem to be simply on the chicken pieces giving it some buffalo taste even if you were just chewing on the wrap and lettuce which i appreciate. The regular fries weren't bad but the sweet potato fries weren't much better and probably not worth the dollar upgrade. The sweet potato fries don't compare to the ones from the Penguin. 

The warehouse chicken received a thumbs up at our table and the Prime rib sandwich was given the \"it was ok\" rating. 

Our server was on top of our drink refills.

i kind of like this place fitting in to the area, sure it isn't too 'eclectic and fun' but it gives a unique watering hole option."}
{"text":"Margaux is easily the best bartender at whiskey warehouse. She's super attentive, an awesome bartender, and was really great at picking out shots we were looking for. Except for the 4 horsemen. I hate her for that. But she's cool, and better than anyone else. Totally jealous of her tattoos too."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place on Mondays for their half off wings. Maybe not the best wings in town but they're pretty dang good. They also have a decent selection of beers on tap and always have have jack Daniels specials. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city and is a fun place to hang out. I would suggest it for a fall game day retreat. Bloody Mary bar is fully stocked on Sundays for brunch!"}
{"text":"Cool place!  I love the ambience... huge bar, lots of tables and booths, big leather chairs, chandeliers.  It's a Gentleman's bar where ladies are welcome.  I like it.  I don't know much about Whiskey but this place makes me want to try their many different kinds.  Oh, and I loooved the music that was playing.  Next time I'll try the food and report back."}
{"text":"Nice rooftop deck. They don't have many beers, but some different mix drinks made up for it."}
{"text":"I've been to Whiskey Warehouse a few times over the past year, and I have never really been blown away by anything. They have a pretty cool vibe going on with a country-western/roadhouse type theme. Also they have three main sections in the building with the main dining room, the \"Single Barrel Room\", and the rooftop bar.

The main dining room is always packed and loud, and can be a good place to catch a sporting event. The Single Barrel Room is usually a little quieter and has a separate bar (although no drafts on tap). They have tables, but they also have couches and comfy chairs if you're just looking to lounge and have a few drinks, and TVs are still in abundance for sports viewing. Upstairs on the rooftop is where I frequent the most. They have a great view of uptown, a relatively good amount of seating, and also some TVs over the bar. Overall, a really cool place to go.

However... I have never had an amazing experience here. The service is always fairly slow and inattentive, and I feel like a lot of the menu items are over priced. They have a good selection of bar food and appetizers, but it's tough to find anything for less than $10. The most appalling thing to me is the price of beer. NoDa's \"Hop, Drop, 'n' Roll\" is one of my favorite beers, and a 16-oz can will run you $9. WHOA! It's tough for me to justify going to have a couple of drinks and an appetizer with friends and forking over close to $40 with tip.

Definitely a fun place to go, but make it a special occasion, and be sure to save up for it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and drinks on a Friday night and sat out on the rooftop patio. Really nice out there and service was good too, even though it was relatively busy. Four of us tried to share a pitcher but it would have been better for three people. That's about all you get from a pitcher, three drinks. The Lynchburg Lemonade was pretty good, had to get something with whiskey since we were there :)  Ordered the Monterey Chicken Sandwich and it was really good! Grilled chicken with salsa, guac, and cheese on a really good bun and the fries were the real kind with the little crispy skin pieces, so good. Everyone else got burgers and all finished so seemed to be good. Boyfriend got the Elvis burger that had bacon, cheese and pb on it! He liked it even tho sounds kinda strange to me. Said he'd have a burger with pb on it again :) Anywho, we'll definitely return sometime. Prices aren't too bad, great view of Uptown from the patio and heaters up there for the cooler weather. Plus its close to other bars if you'd like to hop around Plaza Midwood for the night."}
{"text":"The only place I will watch BAMA Football on a Saturday afternoon/evening! I mean who can really beat $4 Jacks, come on!! I love the atmosphere here, everyone is usually really nice and speak to you like we were friends in college. I love the rooftop bar especially when its a nice day outside since it can get a little loud downstairs. The wings and burgers have always been my go to when I come in and watch the game. I have also heard the buffalo chicken dip is a must try! I still need it try it myself. I always have a good time at Whiskey Warehouse, only down side is parking can be a little hard to find in the area but besides that love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a cool venue. $4 Jack Daniels whiskey all the time will certainly keep my husband coming back.

We came in as a group of 4 for dinner and drinks. One star off because it was too loud to have a good conversation but the food was decent bar food and came out quickly. The pretzels were delicious. My friend had the pasta dish for a simple $12 and coming from the northeast, that is unheard of! I could certainly get used to these prices!


As for the atmosphere - very loud, lots of sports games on TV and it seemed like there was a dj playing. The upstairs has a rooftop deck that I'm excited to visit in warmer months!"}
{"text":"Love whiskey warehouse!! I'm upset they don't do their wing special on Mondays anymore and even more upset when a place that's known for whiskey runs out of whiskey!!! This has happened twice already."}
{"text":"I came here last night and I think our family may have found a place where we could become regulars. Coming in, first thought was that it was a bar...but not like every other bar where only sports ruled the televisions. It had a family feel as most bars didn't. On top of the family feeling, service was great. Our waiter was on top of everything and we even shared a nice conversation with her.

So lets get on to the food. I ordered the Charleston Shrimp Pasta which I thought was pretty good. It was a well portioned meal, with garlic bread, cheese, and of course shrimp on top of linguini pasta. I thought it was great. It had a nice blend of taste as well as a cheesy taste which I say is always good. It wasn't too overpowering to the point where you couldn't taste any of the other flavors of the dish.

Other dishes that were ordered were of course the Fried Green Tomatoes. It seems like it's a favorite around here so we decided to order it and it was good! There were no complaints about that dish.

Overall, I felt like this place was a great restaurant for families and drinkers alike. With a loft with a great view of the city (which I recommend to go during fall when it's cooler) and drinks and food, you won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars to frequent in the Charlotte area. The staff is always very friendly and attentive and the food has never disappointed but the rooftop patio is the highlight of this establishment. Come for the view and stay for the brews and food!"}
{"text":"Fun, cheap, exactly what I expected, the roof is cool. The staff is friendly and attractive, specifically the bartenders...they were fast and nice to me. Thank you. And thank you place."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  First I love whiskey, it's one of my favorites.  The atmosphere here is good and so is the service.  The food is what keeps me coming back.

Before moving to the South I didn't know pimento cheese existed and my waistline was thankful.  Currently it is on the top of my list of favorite foods and my expanding waistline has to visit the gym more often to keep up.  All this rambling is to say GET THE SOUTHERN CHICKEN SANDWICH.  It is a dietary nightmare but oh so delicious.  It is a fried chicken breast with pimento cheese and bacon on a gloriously soft bun.  I've had other stuff here too and it's good, but this sandwich is by far my favorite.  Try it, you won't be sorry...unless you're on a diet."}
{"text":"They have indoor (downstairs) and outdoor (upstairs) seating. They have build your own bloody Marys and decent food. I really liked the buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken wings. The upstairs patio is a pretty good size and has its own bar."}
{"text":"I met some friends for drinks at the rooftop bar area this weekend and was REALLY hungry.  I ordered the most convenient thing to eat which were the chicken tenders.  I was a skeptic while waiting thinking the food would just be mediocre given that it seems more of a drinking type place.  The tenders and fries came out piping hot and they were some of the best tenders I've ever had!  They were really crispy on the outside but very moist and tender on the inside.  I can't wait to go back and have them again.  Service and waitstaff were pretty on point.  Friendly and accommodating and fast."}
{"text":"Well I don't honestly have much to say... I've been here before and their spinach dip is okay. As a vegetarian its wonderful to see a section of the menu devoted to things I can eat but I've just never ordered any of them. They have a pretty varied beer selection, which is nice, and I got an OMB Copper (or 2) for $3/pint last night. The ambiance is nice and I would probably go back. However, last night I was faced with one of those service no-nos.... actually there were two of those as well. I sat down at the bar with my friends and waited 5 minutes before either bartender realized that I was a new member of our group of 4 and that I was signaling them so that I could order. Got a beer, all was fine and then I realized I was hungry. It took another 10-15 minutes before I could get their attention for a food menu. And once I had decided it took another 5-10 minutes to get their attention that I was ready to order dinner. Let me say that the whole time I was trying to get their attention, I would raise my hand or say \"excuse me\" every time they passed in front of me to signal that I would like for them to come over. It was as if they were intentionally ignoring me. So I finally put my food order in (2 sides: mashed potatoes and mac and cheese) & I finished my beer. I wanted another one so I waited (again) and tried to grab their attention (again) as they were walking around right in front of me (again). I waited about 30 minutes for my 2 sides and at this point I hadn't eaten anything besides a handful of cheez-its all day so I'm getting antsy. 40 minutes pass and I still haven't received anything and I was frustrated and hungry so I cancelled my order. I didn't care to ask why or how long it'd be because they had been ignoring me all night and I didn't want to deal with that any more. Plus my friend was leaving and I didn't want to have to scarf my food down in 10 minutes. So after 40+ minutes of waiting, I asked the bartender to cancel my order & her reaction implied that she had never even put the order in. Its fine- I ended up having macaroni and cheese and chocolate cake from Harris Teeter last night in case anyone was worried about my not eating yesterday. But anyways, on the bright side, which is why this review wasn't lower, she took care of one of my beers for the inconvenience of not having any food. It was appreciated and it seems like its hard for people to take responsibility for stuff and make it right these days- especially in the service industries. I wish more businesses would do that and I'm willing to give them another chance just for that alone. Plus, as I said before, they have a whole section of the menu for vegetarian food. Can't pass that up."}
{"text":"Delicious burger. There is a fried appetizer ball with some sort of pepper is also very good. Rooftop view of the city is delightful."}
{"text":"I like Whiskey Warehouse. We go there to sit up top and have drinks and eat every now and then. I just wish they would take the feed back on their food more seriously. If they want to charge this much, they need to provide better quality food. They have 10 wings for $16. What? A SIDE salad is $6 and trust me it's nothing to write home about. Overall, it's bar food... some things are better than others but either way it's bar food and it's way over priced. If you're going for a cool environment and a drink, this is the place but don't expect much out of the food."}
{"text":"Went here last night around 6:30, after my fiancé came home from work. They do not have a lot of parking (shared parking with common market), and I notice some people parking in the post office lot. We actually found a spot pretty quickly, I think it was like the fourth spot in. Anyways, we were greeted as soon as we walked in. She offered inside or outside (rooftop). It was a little brisk for me so we chose inside. We were sat at a booth and within a minute our waitress came over. She was nice, but low spoken so sometimes I didn't even hear what she was saying. The music was a bit loud too, I felt like I had to yell during my conversation. But they had a TON of televisions, which was good because we wanted to see the end of the 4 o'clock games. We both ordered a salad (mine was a house and he chose the ceasar). We both ordered the wings, last time we came was a whiiiillleee back and their menu changed just a little. The fries did not come with the wings but now they do!! The fries are good! Natural cut and not burnt or crispy. I loved them. And the wings were good, needed a little more sauce but you can always ask for more. 

Overall, the food was good for \"bar food\". The server was a little shy - or soft spoken, or maybe both- but she was nice and checked on us several times. 

I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"10 wings for 16 dollars; they better be the size of my arm. (Disclosure: they aren't)"}
{"text":"After a few visits here I've really come to appreciate what they offer & that they offer it with pretty consistent service & food. I rank the atmosphere pretty high...the inside (downstairs) has a beautiful big bar, various seating options, good music playing, & plenty of tv's. The outside (upstairs) has lots of covered seating, a full bar, plenty of tv's, & a nice view of the city skyline. The food has been surprisingly tasty to me & they do it consistently. It's becoming a regular spot, especially when we learned which nights have the drink or food special we like. Cheers"}
{"text":"We had a large group Saturday night, and were seated on the rooftop.  Great views and comfortable seating.  There were mixed comments from the group about their food.  Pimento poppers were great.  My hamburger was forgotten, and when it came they had overcooked it.  But, to their credit, a manager came over as soon as they realized it was late and they comped it. So, overall, a mixed bag, but we would give it another chance."}
{"text":"This is a really cool place for a snack, meal, or drinks because of their rustic decor and especially because of their rooftop view of the Queen City -- the rooftop is full service so you can eat and drink... or just drink! I recommend this place for the view, the mac 'n cheese (delicious!!) and their perfectly seasoned and cooked fries!"}
{"text":"I tried going for brunch on a Sunday with my parents. My dad had the shrimp and grits and said it was so good that he went to talk to the cook! My mother and I had omelets and they were good, just not impressive. I will say that the biscuits were great. Who knew?! A friendly staff and great atmosphere didn't hurt either. I will go back to see what it's like for drinks and \"bar food\". 

They do have the bar smell going on though but you get used to it quickly."}
{"text":"another pretty cool spot in the trendy Plaza-Midwood area, one of my favorite Charlotte neighborhoods.  Food is pretty good and usually they have some type of half decent special going.  I would hardly call myself a whiskey guru, hell to think of it the only thing I know about whiskey is jack daniels and jim beam, which I know beam is technically bourbon, but they have a lot more options then the average going bar will.  Anyways, back to the warehouse review.  The rooftop bar is a great hangout, the wife and I have spent a few weekend afternoons here on warm sunny days.  The crowd is typically a late 20's early 30's kinda crowd, usually good people just looking to have a good time.  This isn't exactly the kinda place that makes you dying to go back, however, it is a cool place to spend some time have some drinks and you typically won't regret the trip.  I have heard the brunch is pretty decent but have not had the opportunity to partake myself."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience here!! Margaux made us feel welcome and had a blast with us, really went above and beyond with her service for us! We will absolutely be back to enjoy another Sunday evening with Margaux!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food and the service everytime I frequent this Plaza/Midwood hangout!  Great TV coverage, good music, and lots of room if you want to go with a group.  And rumor has it, they are getting ready to open a kick ass roof top bar!  Can't wait for that!  FYI...parking can be somewhat of a challenge during busier times."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always have a great experience when I come here. I mainly come for brunch and the chicken and waffles is awesome! The sausage gravy is what makes it so good! I also enjoy their mimosas and Bloody Mary bar. The Bloody Mary bar has a great selection of mixes and toppings. I've also had their wings with the Jack Daniels sauce and their burger and they are both great!"}
{"text":"Sorry, they've failed again! Food is not good here. I've given this place multiple tries after bad experiences! Rooftop bar is great, food is not! I'm here again for Prime Rib night. Meat is just ok, baked potato wasn't cooked through! This happens regularly! So so disappointing! Bad thing is, they just don't care! I told my bartender (Molly) my issue with my crappy meal and she was nice, yet no manager came over to apologize or to try and rectify the situation! That seems to be the norm here, that the managers just don't care? I mean, even the busboy who took my plate, apologized, but not one manager came over?"}
{"text":"While I can't certainly classify this place as a true Warehouse (see also, Men's Warehouse), it is a great bar/addition to an already happening scene in Plaza Midwood. 

This place rules supreme in the Spring/Summer time, as their rooftop bar is one of the best in Charlotte. I believe nearby Peculiar Rabbit also has a rooftop, but it's sans bar, so I still would give my vote to Whiskey in this particular neighborhood. 

$4 Jack Daniels AllDayErrDay, which is always my go-to. Food has always been superb, and is definitely one notch above normal bar fare. 

If the weather is nice, head upstairs---you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The website says Sunday brunch ends at 2:30, but when we sat down at 1:25 we were told brunch was over and they had switched to the lunch menu. Not sure if this was a one time thing or the new norm, but highly inconvenient either way since we came here specifically for brunch food. The food we ended up ordering was great, but the service was nothing special. $12 carafes of mimosas have a surprisingly good champagne-OJ ratio (despite taking 20 minutes to get one after sitting down at our table). I'll come back here, but I def won't rant and rave about it."}
{"text":"I have a mixed opinion on this place.  I have ate here three times, with one YUM experience, one \"That was pretty good\" and one \"eeeehhhhh\" that was ok experience.

The salmon salad is DELICIOUS!  I would highly recommend it for a healthy option.  I also saw a few friends get it.  The only thing I will say is that the actual salmon portion has looked a little inconsistent.

I got the Buffalo Chicken wrap with grilled chicken instead of fried.  It was pretty good, nothing special.  

My ehhhhhh dish was the Prime Rib sandwich.  I was really excited to try it, especially after my server spoke so highly of it, but I was disspointed.  I think the worst part was the bun it was served on.  It was what I'd consider a \"sandwich bun\" you would get at a cafeteria, with weird seed things on it.

Good drink specials....Bud Light for $2 and Bloody Mary bar with a million sauces and mixes for $3.  The upstairs patio is awesome!  Though doesn't compete with the new member of the neighborhood's Peculiar Rabbit."}
{"text":"Got asked for leave for no reason - this place sucks   way better places to eat and drink in plaza

After receiving a snarky message from management I have decided to expand on the above review which was written hastily.

On Saturday evening multiple parties of a conjoining friend group arrived at this establishment around 7:30pm. After ordering drinks and food, a member of one of the tables who suffers with a disability began playing with a container of ketchup she was given. She accidentally let it fall over the rail and some of it fell on the bouncer. Unaware of the situation, the 15+ member party was shocked to find their bouncer yelling and threateningly the young woman in the party. Shortly afterwards the poor waitress was told to throw everyone out (even members of the party at a different table completely unaware of what had happened). After a brazen attempt to box our food (and they made sure they got money out of us), they forced everyone to leave. Management never asked what had happened and the waitress looked incredibly uncomfortable.

After posting the review and receiving a self righteous message from management I will stand behind this review in its entirety because the situation, while understandable from the other side, was handled without much tact. I am sure that many members of the party after feeling disrespected will not be returning.

As for food and drink, average at best. There are excellent restaurants and fun bars in the area, I would steer clear of this establishment as they blindly listen to aggressive bouncers instead of patrons."}
{"text":"The fact that I'm not really into Whiskey sort of explains the three stars. This is a VERY popular place to hangout in Plaza Midwood. My last visit I tried the buffalo shrimp for the first time and they were decent. The salmon sandwich and fried fish sandwich are REALLY good. This is a great place to watch the game."}
{"text":"I moved to the Charlotte area about the same time Whiskey Warehouse opened.   My first experience was not so great...  An over-crowded NFL playoff game.

Since that time, ALL of my experiences have been fantastic.   The management and staff there do an amazing job.   Sam, the executive chef, also does a fantastic job.   As a new person to the QC in 2010, Whiskey became my home away from home....   Most of the friends I have here are a direct result of my times eating and drinking at the Whiskey Warehouse."}
{"text":"INFESTED WITH COCKROACHES. An example would be that I came here3 times over an 8 month span and every single time there has been so many cockroaches crawling around the tables, bar and floor. I told my waitress and she smiled then walked away. Told the manager and she gave the same bs story as 8 months ago. (Oh and $10 for 5 wings...) 

Used to be an awesome place but gone down hill"}
{"text":"Still waiting for food... 45 minutes later... :( not that crowded in here. The Mimosa is good, though."}
{"text":"Whiskey Warehouse has always been a favorite when in P Wood. Food is tasty (way more than your normal bar food) and service is always friendly. The addition of the rooftop bar is genius and a perfect vantage point to watch the city skyline. Had the portabella burger last time with sweet potato fries and it was all delicious. Of course, I'm a sucker for portabella burgers, those shrooms make everything delicious. 

They have a wide selection of whiskey (of course) and other liquors. And a decent selection of beer. Bartender made me a gimlet one time and it was spot on. I love me my gimlets. 

They have a great space for hanging out with a group of buddies, watching whatever sport is on, a fun night out, or even a date spot (mood lighting ftw)."}
{"text":"The chairs on the roof are the most uncomfortable seating I've EVER sat in. Won't get anyone to stay long in these seats."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of Scotch, Whiskey and Bourbon!  Good pours for the price.  Knowledgable staff - they know what they got and got what they know!  Helped us learn even more about whiskeys, bourbons, and scotch.

Service is always friendly and attentive. Super fun gals!

The pimento cheese and chips Rocked! Yum!

Highly recommend Whiskey Warehouse!"}
{"text":"Whiskey Warehouse - your service sucks and I could get better pimento cheese dip at the HT across the street.  I was here last Thursday and at 11pm a snottty manager-type lady came over and asked us to cash out because she wanted to leave for the night.  WHAT??  How can you be rude and come over so early?!  I looked at my watch and thought geeez time must have gotten away from us but no - it was only 11.  Are you kidding?  Can yall get with it?"}
{"text":"Great rooftop and friendly service."}
{"text":"I would likely give more stars for this place if the service and food reviews were better. 

If I could give rankings on individual 'areas' of a restaurant and get a mediums number, I'm pretty sure this would fall in the middle. 

The best thing about this place is the location/atmosphere. This is in a great place, just outside the uptown and super convenient to access. The vibe inside is relaxed, but fun. My favorite part is the rooftop deck complete with a large \"U\" shaped bar in the middle surrounded by various sized tables. There's roof access from inside and outside the building. There's a pretty sweet view and it's just a great spot to take advantage of lovely CLT weather 

My visits were complete of four women on both occasions and service was mediocre. They weren't very busy, and we often found the servers standing around the register area...sometimes eating, sometimes touching their hair. Most seemed quite young. 

The beer was priced accordingly as well as the meals. They're were everlasting different dishes ordered and none of them were raved over. The true highlight for me was their sweet potatoes fries - OMG!!! I'm not a huge junk food person, but when I have good food out in front of me...all bets are off. These things are magical. I would say they're in between a shoe string and regular sized straight cut fry, made of delicious sweet potatoes. They were perfectly cooked and I don't think even one of the big ones were soggy. I personally think soggy fries (sweet or regular potato) are THE WORST! These babies are on point.. I ate all of them, but left the chicken tenders as leftovers"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but my server on the rooftop was beyond awful this past Thursday. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Met some friends for a few drinks and some appetizers. After being rushed to order, we were interrupted by a giant cockroach that ran across our table and down the wall. The manager was very understanding and comp'd us our food.  We paid for our drinks, tipped our waitress, and headed to the bar where the manager said we were more than welcome to sit. Once there, we were instructed, completely unprofessionally, by the bartender that people were sitting there still. So we went and sat at a different table. Two minutes later, the hostess told us to leave because there was a short wait.  We were left with drinks in our hand, and no where to go after being grossed out by a big damn bug.  So in short: alright food, bad service, and BUGS. It was an absolutely awful experience."}
{"text":"Ask for CJ or TJ. I can never remember which he goes by but super nice and will do anything to make your experience great."}
{"text":"My last time here (and I DO mean last time), they had lost control of their own establishment.  They couldn't get you a table or tell you how long it would be.  You were supposed to wade into the crowd and commandeer your own table.  And then, best of luck getting service.  If this is your only option for a night out, stay home.  I hope it let's me vote no stars.  One star is WAY too many."}
{"text":"Plaza is not a huge area but if it is summer and your in the area, WW rooftop is the way to go! I have yet to try their food, so TBC..."}
{"text":"Normally the food here is really good but for some reason it's been flaky. Ordered wings tonight that took about 40 minutes to come out. They were fully cooked but were extremely cold in some areas. Almost as if they were previously cooked and then reheated, partially. I would've said something to the waitress but I really didn't want to wait another 40 minutes. I'll probably order again but next time I'll call ahead. Would be 5 stars because I do enjoy this place but when you charge more for wings than any other place, you need to make sure they are nothing short of perfect every single time."}
{"text":"What a great place to come and eat and have a few drinks on top of the roof.  Make sure to get their early during weekend nights and Thursday and Friday nights if you want to sit at the roof top bar as it fills up very quickly.  It has a casual ambience so feel free to come with a t-shirt and flip flops.  They have a nice selection of food for anyone.  They have limited draft beer options since mainly bottles.  Parking is also an issue during busy times.  Park at Harris Teeter, the post office, or on the opposite corner if no spots are available.  Their prime rib is awesome and I am a huge fan of their wings.  I make sure to order them crispy and ask them to make it as hot as they can since their sauces aren't that hot."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed.  This is our 2nd time coming here to have a drink and eat dinner.  Our first experience wasn't terrible but wasn't the best either.  This time around we both ordered veggie wraps.  The menu stated it was a wrap with seasonal veggies, rice, lettuce, tomato and cheese.  Ours only had rice, zucchini and 1 tiny piece of carrot.  Some veggie wrap! The draft beer I ordered was out and our waitress had zero clue about any of the beers.  Our waitress, along with the others we saw, acted like they didn't want to be there as well.  

They have a rooftop bar here, which is pretty cool but it gets packed at peak times.  I guess if we were to come back, it would be just for a drink on the patio.  Maybe we will give the food another shot...or maybe not."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was the best thing about this place. The music was great and football was on the big screen. That was about all I can say positive about this restaurant. The french fries were soggy and not fully cooked, the bread on the sandwiches was stale and old and the wings were not crispy, just soggy. The manager asked if all was ok as I was paying the bill. I mentioned the fries were not fully cooked and the bread was stale. She just said she hoped it was better next time. What next time!? Never going back."}
{"text":"Thought I already reviewed this place but maybe not?  Oh well, it's not the first place I think of when I want to hang out in Midwood.  The service and food is par and the beer selection is sub par compared to other bars in the area.

The patio on the roof is the real benefit.  If the weather is right, there's not many better patios or rooftop locations in Charlotte to go to.  My suggestion is to try it for yourself.

The interior decor is actually pretty cozy with warm wood materials, etc.  Parking can be tough as it is with any business in Plaza Midwood so be ware."}
{"text":"1 star for good location (rooftop bar with a view of the city) and for the selection of whiskey. I came with a small group for dinner tonight-we were able to get a table on the roof right away. It was a nice view of the sunset over the Uptown. Was not thrilled with much of anything else the rest of the night.

There is a great selection of bourbon/scotch at the bar downstairs/inside; but you cannot order any of them upstairs on the rooftop. That was disappointing. 

We also had poor service (wouldn't see the waitress for 20 minutes at a time), drinks (both liquor and simply water) and food came out SUPER slow.

Last thing, one friend at the table ordered salmon-which came out completely raw. Besides the fact that neither waitress or manager offered up an apology, the manager actually took the salmon back to the kitchen to cook it longer, asking \"if that was ok, rather than bringing out a fresh piece of fish\". Will not be back."}
{"text":"Good enough pub food with a kind of annoying attitude.

I was happy to see something go in to the space left by Creation.  

I've been several times for supper or lunch with groups ranging from two to eight.  They have a burger with bacon and egg that is delicious, if freakishly messy, and what I usually get.  Their sweet potato fries are crispy and garlicky like I like them.  They have at least a couple of vegetarian options, although the one my partner gets usually would better be described as cheese sauce with a few vegetables over white rice (not unappealing, but not light or healthy in any way).  

There are LOTS of TVs throughout the bar and next to each booth, although they are easy enough to ignore if you want to have a conversation.  There seems to be an extensive bar, although I've never tried it.

As for the attitude, this is a restaurant with roughly eight parking spaces during the day when other businesses in the area are open.  The restaurant has decided that a good use of one of those spaces, and the one closest to the door mind you, is as permanent parking of a testosterone surrogate muscle car.  God knows I'm all for attitude and funky, but not when it interferes with function.  

The staff routinely park in the post office parking lot next door during business hours, which then leaves the post office without adequate parking.  WW's owners are adding a rooftop bar this winter, requiring even more parking.  There is a sense of entitlement and disdain for their neighbors that doesn't sit well with me.

If you are looking for a place to watch a game or for a bar at which to stop on the way home, you could do worse.  If you are looking for a good neighbor, you'll probably want to move on."}
{"text":"They should change the name.   Came here with 3 buddies so we could sample some different bourbons.   We each decided to get a different flight of bourbon.   NONE of our choices were available!   Yet all were listed on the menu.   And with three of the secondary choices, the best bourbon in the offering wasn't  available.   If they are legitimately out of this many selections, then the manager should be fired.   Our waitress was nice and that poor management put her in a challenging situation.   Our food was ok and the atmosphere wasn't bad.   But this is NOT a Whiskey Warehouse.   Not even close."}
{"text":"This place had an amazing roof top terrace.  I wish their food was as good as the view.  Food is mediocre unfortunately.  I ordered the chicken nachos.  Very sub-par.  Cheap tortilla chips, canned cheese, and pretty sure the salsa was from a jar. We really love coming to this place for drinks, I just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Food sucks even for bar food wings are horrible along with their fried food and stay away from fries and mac n cheese they do have some good specials on whiskey only good thing about this place."}
{"text":"This is me giving Al and his staff my redemption song. I finally made it back in there, this time with my coupon, and had dinner again. I could make a comment on the service being a tiny bit slow.....but they were SLAMMED when we walked in. However, the hostess greeted us promptly and let us know she was doing her best to get us a table. We only waited a few minutes and they had us down and the server came by. I wish I remembered her name because not only was she personable, she was funny too....major plus. We ordered an Asian Style Grilled Chicken and Rice appetizer (which must be new,because the waitress was not aware of it) and it was awesome. It definitely shouldn't be overlooked when ordering. I got the Veggie Burger and my friend got a Maple Pineapple Chicken Sandwich concoction which I advised her against because it seemed like an odd combination. Stupid me....it was awesome! Both were actually really good. Beer was really cold and they had $2 Domestics....another plus. Service was prompt, especially considering they had 3 HUGE parties in at the same time. I will most def be back again and again. Oh.....and did I mention the manager also comped us free shots....that's service....with a smile!"}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Whiskey Warehouse upstairs. This trip I ordered the salmon to go. I asked that they substitute spinach for the rice which they gladly did. When I got home, the salmon was cooked perfectly and the vegetables were very nice. 
I always get really good service upstairs."}
{"text":"The food was great, drinks were tasty and average priced.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First of all I should say I have never actually eaten at whiskey warehouse, because the wait is always inevitably too long. However it is always fun to enjoy drink on the top deck. We frequently get a pitcher of drinks to drink an every time have been impressed with how much alcohol they pack in for us! You certainly get your money's worth! If you are looking for a place to chill with friends and enjoy drinks, whiskey warehouse is busy and loud but can be a fun scene."}
{"text":"The rooftop bar is so much fun.  It was a great place to watch the fight and have a few drinks. People were friendly and it was a great atmosphere.  We didn't try any food."}
{"text":"I expected to walk into this place and be surrounded with girls dancing on the bar ala Coyote Ugly (sad that's what I think of when I think whiskey bar!), but was pleasantly surprised all around.

We came for a baseball game, Tuesday night around 730. There were some open tables, but we opted for the bar. Asian female bartender was great, and the beers were fresh and clean off the tap and some nights they've got great specials on domestic beers and Monday they've got a deal on ribs.

Anyway, we ordered the Protein Platter (new on the menu) and the Salmon sandwich. Protein Platter was EXCELLENT, and the salmon sandwich was cooked well but I felt like the spicy aoli lacked spice and taste.

Staff was attentive, cheerful and accurate. Food was great, but I felt the salmon was a little blah. Sure it's not your average Plaza Midwood haunt with the mix of punks, bankers and bums BUT it's really a comfy, nice bar that I'll definitely head back to."}
{"text":"Decent spot to get drink. Draft beers and Jack Daniels"}
{"text":"I had a lot of fun here last night . I was a little disappointed that the roof was close but it was cold outside so that's reasonable . The bartenders did great they were very responsive for how packed they were . I haven't tried the food but I will definitely return !"}
{"text":"If you didn't walk into a bar, you wouldn't know you were eating pub food. Amazing mac & cheese. Great wings. The 'famous' pimento cheese is awesome. If you are there for breakfast, get the biscuits and gravy. They are the best I've had in Charlotte! 

The atmosphere is great and with the new deck open it is the place to be! If i lived closer, I'd be there every night."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had one of the best hamburgers I have ever had! Thick, charcoal grilled, very good! The prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Pretzel with cheese and mustard great flavor, crispy and nice and soft.

Whisky mac hamburger okay, asked for med rare, got very well done.

Liked the Bloody Mary bar, 5 dollar for a glass, 3 for a virgin. I had the sweet potato fries, very crispy. 

Wings are not jumbo as advertised on menu. Over fried and dry. Better get it with ranch to hydrate it. 

Salad not worth 9 dollars, a handful of roman lettuce with three thin slices of avocado. 
Good place to hang out on the roof top with friends for drinks. Typical bar food. Just okay."}
{"text":"Do not go here unless you like poor service, incorrect food, and enjoy waiting an hour for wings. Not only did our waitress take forever to take our order and bring our drinks but when the food came it was wrong. The service was unapologetic and the food was over cooked. Our drinks were constantly empty and dirty dishes were not cleaned up. The atmosphere was fun and I can imagine it is fun late at night but no way were we staying any longer."}
{"text":"OK, so first of all...I love Whiskey Warehouse. The food is good, the people are good, the TVs are great for watching the big game. I go there often to eat lunch. They've always been good to me and the fam. But I must update my original review. I've ordered takeout quite a few times. Mostly without and issue. But for the last three times there's been serious issues with my takeout order. And usually it's not until I get the food home in \"good light\" when I can tell somethings wrong. Tonight, after the 3rd time I have to change my review and rating. I ordered 10 wings and mac and cheese. 2 of the wings had bones showing and were overly dry (fried hard). And one wing was so dry, it was like dry cowhide. Needless to say I was disappointed. My hope is that they will get back to providing good food and good service on takeout just as they do when you're sitting in the establishment. I'll continue to visit WWH. But not sure how soon I'll be ordering takeout though."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would. Watched a very over served man continue to be served, then get in his car and drive. We simply went to get a drink and the bartender was clueless. We ordered old fashioneds, and she said \"we're out of bitters, well maybe, I think\". I'm in a bar called Whiskey Warehouse, and you don't have bitters. She attempted to make two drinks for us anyway, one was all water and a cherry thrown in, not drinkable. The other was a half pour of a whiskey that was not what I requested or paid for. It's no wonder everyone around us was drinking wine or beer. Never going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting, I found this restaurant through Instagram #clteats. I was so excited to try the Grilled Tenderloin w/ garlic cream sauce, broccoli and rice. It wasn't on the menu but the staff and the Kitchen manager Chris was so awesome he made especially for me since it was my first time. The food was amazing. Definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"I feel weird writing a review on Whiskey, because i've been coming here consistently from day one!  It's probably my favorite bar in Charlotte....that doubles as a good restaurant.  Most places that have this type of bar setting and tv's for sports, tend to slack off on the food prep.  That is not the case here!  I've tried probably 15/20 menu items at this point, counting specials, lunch, brunch and dinner and i'm always pleased!

Some of my favorite items are:
Buffalo Chicken Wrap, switching the Buffalo sauce for Honey BBQ.
Warehouse Burger and fries
Pimento Cheese App
Fried Chicken tenders in Honey BBQ
Prime Rib Sandwich.

Also, you can't beat $4 Jacks and their Bloody Mary bar on weekends!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it has not let me down! Whiskey warehouse has one of the next rooftop bars/seating areas in the Charlotte area. It's very spacious and of course, has a great view of the city! 

The food has never disappointed. Some of my favorites are the buffalo chicken wrap, pimento cheese dip, and chicken Caesar salad. If you're in a pickle with making a decision, these three are always my go to and delicious! The menu is pretty big so I find myself being so indecisive more often than not, so it's always good to have your go tos. I always look forward to trying something different though if I am in the mood to expand my horizons :) 

Drink specials are good for what I have seen. 2$ mimosas on Sunday's, 4$ for a double....can't go wrong with that! Overall drink prices aren't too bad, pretty normal for Charlotte. Service is always super friendly, dependent upon the day and how busy it is, it can be a little slow which is expected on busy weekend nights. But overall, I always look forward to coming back and trying new things and enjoying the rooftop!"}
{"text":"Awful service! Don't try to get a table over 5 people. They won't seat you at over half their tables because the chair will be in the way. Yet you can have a party of 10 stand around a small table. We waited an hour and still wasn't seated. When I spoke with the manager, he was extremely rude! Don't eat here! So many other restaurants in the Mid Wood area would be grateful for your business. Go anyway but here!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here to watch the Elite 8 games and spent most of my Sunday afternoon here. Service was great and I was happy all of the TVs had my Tarheels on!!"}
{"text":"So....checked out the place on Saturday night. I've only been here one other time and it was for lunch, so I don't remember too much about the place. From reading other reviews, i'm assuming the upstairs is a recent addition? I'm sure it will be a 100% return investment for WW. Parking was pretty difficult to find, but i'm sure it was probably even worse than normal this weekend b/c of the locals that were trying to flee to other places away from uptown, due to the CIAA tournament in town for the weekend. I'm a sucker for places with no cover, so that earned WW some points. We got there around 11pm and the downstairs area wasn't really that crowded. We walked upstairs and it was pretty packed....kinda hard to walk around, but hey, that's life, right? The ladies there were pretty good looking and appeared to be well put together. I'm a people watcher, so I look at everyone....as for the fellas, like others have touched on, there were your typical frats and older gentlemen that look like they just came out of retirement, but haven't been out in so long, they don't know how to fit into a social environment....Sperrys boat shoes, button down shirts tucked into jeans (oh my goodness, a fashion pet peeve for me....almost worse than flip flops with jeans and a hoodie), sportcoats that look like they came from the two piece suit that they probably wear during the week for work.....anyways, gotta stay on topic right?  Music was your typical 80s/90s hits that most bars play.....nothing special. Drinks were reasonably priced, spectacular views of the Uptown Charlotte skyline and that purrty Duke Energy Building. Would definitely check out the place again as I do like to switch up my spots....it has potential to be a good Spring/Summer joint"}
{"text":"So- I have a theory. A group of guys at WW need to go to Soul and a group of girls from Soul need to check out WW. Basically, this is a sausage fest and the men look a little confused about why there are SO MANY GUYS there. Trust me guys, Soul is where the girls are.

This isn't really my scene, but the upstairs bar is a really great view of Charlotte. The drinks are good. The menu has some favorites (prime rib slider thing, wings, so on). 

LADIES- this is a brilliant place to go if you have a couple of girlfriends and you want some free drinks. Trust me."}
{"text":"Sports fan's paradise.  Seriously, there are flat screens almost lining the perimeter of the place, and a big open bar area allowing for large crows without getting crunched together.   The major drawback, in my opinion is that it's hella loud, but if you're there for the game, we'll just call that 'energy.'   If you're looking for a place to have a conversation over dinner and are not that into sports, I'd probably grab a drink there and then head to a quieter place for dinner."}
{"text":"I really like this place BUT the other reviews are correct. It's hit or miss when it comes to service. I eat here ALOT. A whole lot....but lately the staff keeps changing. The ladies that know us as a regulars treat us fabulous especially Brandy but the rest....not so much. I came in for brunch today. I sat at the bar since I was dining alone. There were 8 people at the bar, max. I sat for several minutes and the bartender never even acknowledged my existence. I really wanted a waffle and realized the patio was open so I went upstairs. Night and day. Ashley greeted me promptly and was attentive. I also notice that lunch service is pretty bad. Last week they had to comp my lunch because the waitress never put my order in. Why do I keep coming back?  Because I really like the food. I normally stick to a salad with salmon or the waffles for brunch plus they have $2 mimosas. Also half price apps from 4-6pm."}
{"text":"The cost of wings have gone up for every restaurant, yet whiskey warehouse has decided to discontinue the special in which it got popular off of. I dont like that idea, what's next the $4 Jack will stop?? BS"}
{"text":"Met some friends here on Sunday for drinks and food.  I've stopped in here for drinks before but had never ordered any food.  They had bloody marys for $3, along with mimosa's, redneck mimosa's, and bud lights for $2.  I thought the redneck mimosa's were especially good; they are a mixture of lions head beer, orange juice, and a splash of ginger ale.  

I'm not a huge salmon fan but the the salmon salad looked especially good for $9 and the chicken tenders were nicely breaded and very fresh.  I had the southern sandwich which consisted of a fried chicken breast on a bun with bacon, pimento cheese, lettuce, and tomato on top...great sandwich!"}
{"text":"I love the fairly new rooftop patio here - just awesome! My only complaint is that you cannot get food service there. I will say the bartenders were very accommodating and friendly. 

We went downstairs (after about a 10 minute wait) to get a table for 6. 15 minutes later no one even greeted us - I asked a nearby server if she was ours and she replied no, I then asked if she would get the server who was ours. 10 minutes later still nothing so I went back to the hostess who about 10 minutes later sent over that original server who claimed we weren't hers. If they were really busy I might have understood but we watched our \"server\" flirt with several guys at the bar and then stand around and chit-chat at the hostess station. After I explained to her that we would be leaving she just lamely said \"oh sorry\" . We went over to Jacks where the service was fantastic. I think management really needs to work on giving great service because they missed out on 6 dinners and several drinks...not to mention I may think twice about going there on game-day due to poor service."}
{"text":"Wait staff needs to learn how to do breakfast....not asking if coffee needs to be topped off, stopping by after dropping off the food and before bringing the check would be nice.  No, they were not busy and had enough staff.  You could tell because they were all in one corner socializing."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a birthday with a group of 5.  The service and the food was great.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"They were already low on my list. Now they don't even have boneless wings on their half off options for Monday nights. So basically it's adios - I will not be returning. There is literally nothing here for me anymore."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here after going to Common Market on Wednesday for the beer tastings. We've usually sat on the rooftop bar, taking advantage of the nice weather at night. Not so sure how that will work out for us next time though!

The rooftop bar has a great atmosphere. I've been up here on a Saturday night as well when it was pretty crowded, and I still thought it was great. My group has never had a problem finding a table to sit at, and it's usually 6 of us or so. Then again, we arrive a little later, around 9:30ish. The bathrooms at the rooftop are also nice and clean, though they are just one stall only.

The drinks are good, but I usually get the same thing every time and I've discovered each bartender makes them different. Some are better than others. Also, depending on who's in the kitchen, the food will be better than other nights. I had the Whiskey Glazed Salmon salad and it was very good. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks with friends. I wasn't really into the music they were playing but I shouldn't be surprised. Their sangria were good and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have experienced in a while. 20 minutes for drink refills. 20 minutes after our food was brought out WRONG before we were checked on. Keep in mind this is a SUNDAY AT 10pm. Not crowded. No comps occured, which should have since I spent almost a hour of my life waiting to be waited on. Don't spend your time or money at this joke of a establishment."}
{"text":"A warehouse full of whiskey -sure, sounds like fun. A few of us dropped by Whiskey Warehouse after a late dinner down the street. 

We arrived around 9:30 pm on a Friday night and, while it wasn't super crowded it was starting to fill up. The music was definitely loud and they were playing all sorts of tunes, mostly rap & pop when I was there. I agree with Julia S. - the crowd was pretty frat like - but frat brothers 10 years post-college. 

We were able to order drinks right away and the bartender was fairly friendly and efficient. Just as their namesake states, they have an extensive whiskey menu, and I would hope the servers are helpful in those selections, but none of us partook in those libations. They also had a decent wine selection, too. Inside, WW sports a number of big flats screens and a partial brick/industrial feel inside. 

I imagine if you can score a table, this would be a good spot to hang with some friends for a few hours. They also offered some fairly sweet daily drink specials - one that caught my eye is their Sunday drink special - $2 mimosas and $3 Bloody Marys. Mmmmm hmmm...can't wait until noon on Sunday!"}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place a 2 star rating is because the only time I have been here was when it first opened up. The bartenders did not know how to make drinks right and I got overcharged that evening there which prompted me to go to Thomas St. Tavern instead. The rooftop does have a new nice view of the Charlotte Skyline. I have heard great things about the food but have not tried yet. Update will come once I go back. I hope the service is a lot better too."}
{"text":"Is this the best patio in Charlotte? Quite possibly. 

A rooftop bar with a tremendous view of the city. Pair that with great food and the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. Money. 

I've had a little bit of everything from the menu. No complaints. All good. Love the wings. There are daily lunch specials. Thursday is prime rib night. $13/$15 is a great deal. Half off apps Monday-Friday from 4-6pm.

Tons of beers. A good selection of local suds. Great drink specials throughout the week. On Sundays, $2 mimosas and $3 for the bloody mary bar. 

Parking is the one issue here, but that's everywhere in Plaza Midwood. 

Back to the patio... It's no secret. Want to do happy hour? Get there early. 

Lunch, dinner, date night, drinks with friends, Sunday fun day. This place is perfect for it all."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 *s for the rooftop patio and the great views only! I had the fish and chips and it was fried too hard and had no seasoning at all!! The chips aka French fries looked and tasted like they were a day old and just dropped back in some hot grease! I will return for the patio and views but no food for me!! Sad part is the cook told me about this place..shame on him!!"}
{"text":"I went to Whiskey Warehouse to watch the Superbowl and thought it was a decent place to hang out, but nothing special.

We were seated pretty quickly which impressed me given that it was a busy night and we showed up a little bit before kickoff. Our waitress and service was great, but I wasn't blown away by the drink and food options. While the whiskey menu is extensive, the beer selection is lacking and quite pricey.

The rooftop bar seems like a chill place to hang in summer, so I might be back for that!"}
{"text":"They have pretty good bar food, if you can find even one member of their staff that cares about getting it to you. I've given this place like 5 tries. I'm done.

Let me break down your average visit to Whiskey Warehouse.
Step 1 - Walk in and wait 5-10 minutes for a server or host to greet you. 

Step 2 - Wait at your table another 10-15 minutes for your server.

Step 3 - After your server is done updating their Instagram at the server station she will come up to you shocked and appalled that you're the type of horrible human being that would dare order food at a restaurant. How dare you. HOW DARE YOU! She can't even.

Step 4 - Your order is sent to the kitchen and I can only assume the ticket is printed in some type of  ancient language that the staff has to take several hours to break down and translate.

Step 5 - Explain to your friends and family why they haven't seen you in months. Why you've missed holidays, work, birthdays. 
Spoiler: It's because you're STILL waiting on your food.

Step 6 - Get your really solid bar food. Mostly super basic fried food and burgers. It is good tho.

Step 7 - Hope to god you have cash to leave on the table because I can't imagine having to wait to get your check back.

Step 8 - Step outside and cherish the fact that you've seen daylight once more.

A couple of sides to this.
Only order something from the bar if you're some kind of weird person that loves punishment. Like the only way you can enjoy that beer is by suffering impossibly for it first.

I once ordered a to go pretzel to go. The person that took my order said 10-15 minutes. I literally laughed after we hung up. I being the expert planner that I am showed up in 25 minutes, fully expecting to wait another 5-10 minutes. After 45 minutes ... I got my pretzel.

The management is super nice and very apologetic, but at some point sorry isn't good enough and you need to fix your mistakes.

If the place was one street over it would have closed down 1 week in. Their location and the fact that a place called \"Whiskey Warehouse\" will bring in every frat bro within 50 miles is the only reason they stay afloat."}
{"text":"Good location in plaza midwood. Enjoyed some beers & buffalo shrimp. Look forward to going back for prime rib night & to check out the roof when it warms up"}
{"text":"Your typical Charlotte bar. Brussel sprouts can be delicious but the kitchen is extremely inconsistent. Probably won't go back for more than drinks."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food...that's affordable!  Don't forget to check out the rooftop area!"}
{"text":"We just returned from lunch at the new Whiskey Warehouse and based on the very few (as of this writing) reviews out there on the internet we didn't know what to expect. I have to say that I was pleased with the experience overall. We used to frequent the previous establishment at this location called Creation and wondered how they would change the layout and decor. Well, it's nothing at all like the former restaurant. It truly has the look and feel of a combination saloon and warehouse - hence the name (with a few high tech touches thrown in). A lot of dark woods and an open floor plan make it inviting and unpretentious. The long bar which goes nearly 3/4 of the length of the restaurant is sure to be one of the neighborhood's most popular draws. 

Even with the small amount of people in there at 11:45 a.m. on a Wednesday I was surprised at the noise level. My dining partner and I had to talk loudly to be heard. I think it was partially because there was a large 50\" television with the volume on less than two feet from us coupled with the exposed ceiling and general openness that doesn't absorb sound. If that place ever fills up it will be ear shattering. At the very least they should mute all of the televisions so people don't have to talk over them - with the exception of maybe during Panthers games or larger events like the Superbowl. 

My dining partner and I enjoyed the food but didn't partake in any libations since it was still the middle of the workday. We plan to come back for a happy hour sometime in the near future. I had the prime rib sandwich and sweet potato fries. I would grade both at about a B. The well-seasoned beef was shaved instead of a big slab and I preferred it that way. The bun was nothing more than a large hamburger bun and I would have preferred a nice Ciabatta bun or Sour Dough hoagie instead. I also would have liked more of a kick in the horseradish mayo. It was a bit tame and I could barely taste the horseradish. The sweet potato fries were good but unspectacular. I mean, they are just fries so there's not much you can do with them, but they were worth the $1 up charge. Portions for both the sandwich and fries were large. I really felt like I got my $9 worth. My dining partner had the Whiskey Glazed Salmon Salad. She was very happy with it. She was certain the salmon would be overcooked as most restaurants do but she was happy with how it was finished. Her salad was also a very large portion and she said she would definitely order it again...in her words \"a keeper.\" 

The menu to us was just the right size. It was double-sided with about 30+ salad, sandwich and entree items plus 8 or so appetizers. There was a little something for every taste including vegetarians (but nothing vegan because of the dairy). 

Again, we can't speak to the drink menu but it's clear they have just about anything you would want. There were a couple of drink specials written on the board so there is probably something for every budget too. I see this place becoming popular with the after work crowd. Since the bar is so large it seems like a nice place to belly up and hang out with coworkers and friends for a few cocktails on a Friday evening. 

Service was fine. It was about what you would expect at your basic neighborhood restaurant - enough attention without feeling either swarmed over or neglected. Our water glasses were always full and the food was brought out in about 10 minutes. 

I realize the place is new and has yet to develop a following but I was surprised at how empty it was at noon. It was just the two of us and a small group of firefighters from the next door station. There also appeared to be one of the owners or managers with a vendor at another table discussing business. But that was it the entire time we were there. 

If this restaurant is to survive where others in this location have failed (and the owner is reading this) they need to get the word out aggressively. Word of mouth will only go so far. Consistently send around fliers to local businesses with drink specials and coupons and I predict they will fill the place very quickly. And if they keep serving good food with good service like they did today they will hit a home-run in the Plaza Midwood area. 

I think 3 to 3.5 stars is appropriate. That doesn't mean it's bad, just not extraordinary. I'll call it above average. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Above average whiskey selection! 
I was impressed how this place has \"Jack Daniels\" stamped on nearly everything. The place is a giant billboard for Tennessee whiskey. 
When we arrived, it was super loud. They had a DJ playing dance hits, with people getting out of their seats and getting rowdy with the music. The place had a definite fratty vibe. 
The whiskey selection was decent. I've seen much better lists of bourbons, and it seemed like they were mainly just picking out as many whiskeys as they could. They were missing great bourbons, but I guess it's not a bourbon warehouse, huh? 
They offer a variety of decent locally brewed beers, which was exciting. The beers were nearly all $5. 
The service was pretty good, our drinks never went empty, and we were checked up on regularly. 
The place is clean, and well kept. It has a classy interior, with an awesome rooftop patio! 
My favorite thing about this place was the number of televisions that they had going. They're on every surface around, each tuned to a different sporting event. This seems like a great place to catch a game!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying great atmosphere and a great rooftop bar... However the service is terrible! I went in with another girlfriend of mine around 11pm on a Friday night. We sat down at the bar downstairs (which wasn't overly crowded) and ordered a couple of drinks. We let the bartender know we were checking out their late night menu but needed a minute. After a few mins of talking we decided on some food to order and shots... It took the bartender at least 35-40 mins to come back to us. After she had helped almost every guy at the bar was it she noticed us waiting. We promptly asked for our checks without ordering anything further because at this point watching people walk up to the bar and get helped while we were sitting there waiting was beyond frustrating! On our way out we decided to walk upstairs in which we ran into a group of our friends who were having a going away party. We once again decided to try an order shots but the bartenders upstairs were to busy chatting and dancing to notice there were people waiting! No one wants to stand around waiting forever for a shot! Once again it's a great place to hang out but just don't expect any good customer service!! Already saw a bad review about being a female and trying to get service here and it's 100% true!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go after work. I love to go upstairs to the patio that overlooks uptown. The food is pretty good. It's typical bar food. The drinks are really good and inexpensive."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here the other week and sat at the bar downstairs. Usually we sit at the bar upstairs on the roof because it has such a great view, but it was a little too warm for that so we figured we would give the inside bar a try.
It was around 4 in the afternoon and it was just us and two other guys sitting at the bar. 
The bartender quickly greeted us and took our drink order.
My boyfriends drink took maybe a minute, and she dropped it off and walked away. My drink however, showed up almost fifteen minutes later, after she stood at the other end of the bar and had a conversation with a co worker. I let it go, because for all I knew it was an important drink related conversation. 
A bit later when our drinks were looking pretty low she returned, but only long enough to ask my boyfriend if he would like another and then walk away while I was mid sentence trying to let her know that I'd like another drink as well. 
She promptly brought his drink and walked away again, ignoring me as I again, tried to ask her for another drink for myself. 
After ten more minutes of her ignoring me as she kept walking past, the gentleman at the bar beside me finally flagged her down and informed her that I'd been trying to get her attention for a while. With a look a look of total irritation, she turned to me and asked what I needed. Finally I was able to order my second drink...however it took over another ten minutes for her to bring it to me. If I had ordered something difficult then I could understand the delay, but it was just a vodka tonic.
Normally this would be the 
point where we would leave and just go somewhere where the bartenders weren't so horribly rude, but we were famished and decided to just go ahead and order our food, and hope for the best...wish we hadn't. 
While we were ordering, we actually caught her rolling her eyes at us. 
Then when the food came out, she threw the plates down in front of us so hard, that part of my food fell off and landed on the bar, and then she just walked away without a word. That was all we could take.
So after another few minutes of trying to flag her down, she finally came back so we could ask her for boxes, our check, and a manager. 
She returned a few minutes later with one box (instead of the two that we had asked for), our check, and to let us know that the manager was busy and couldn't talk at the moment...Seriously?!?!
We paid and left, and will never be back."}
{"text":"Great environment and food!  Very reasonable prices and rooftop deck is a perfect happy hour spot."}
{"text":"I end up at Whiskey pretty often with clients and friends. It's a nice in between priced spot that has more than decent bar-ish type food. 

Their pimento cheese appetizer is one of my favorite pimento cheeses in town. The chips it comes with are cheap though; but the cheese is so good it basically doesn't matter. They also have a chicken sandwich with the pimento cheese on it and that also rules. 

Their wings are some of the best in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood. Specifically their dry rub recipe. They don't always have them though. Once they're out sometimes it's a couple of days before they have another batch. 

The upstairs patio has a great view of the city and on a nice day the bar area up there is spectacular. They've started food service up there now which is great. The wait staff is typically hit or miss. I've had good and terrible. Kind of depends. At peek hours they're always on. I've tried a few times to watch a game or two there but it just gets SO loud. Not my favorite place if it's prime time and you're trying to have a nice quiet meal."}
{"text":"My reivew is based off of only the roof top bar area.

What I do like about this place is that it's hoppin-and-poppin with people.  The pretty, the ugly and all us in between.  They made STRONG drinks too.  I should probably put that in the \"what I don't like\" section.  I'm 30ish..strong drinks are never good for me.  

What I didn't like was the CROWDED roof top.  You couldn't put your arms in the air and wave'em like you just don't care even if you wanted to.  People stepping on my toes was fun.  Just too crowded for my taste.  Gosh I sound old."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about the great patio at Whiskey Warehouse; so I decided tonight was the night I was going to check it out. I had a great experience with my bartender Chrissy; she was so friendly & had great customer service (you don't see that anymore) with all her bar guests. She really made me feel welcome!! I will definitely be coming back to here to see Chrissy!!"}
{"text":"Moved to Plaza area not long ago and trying to get well acquainted with the local spots. Dined here a few times now and have thoroughly enjoyed every time. Always great drink specials and food has always been very tasty. My Personal favorite, the chicken nachos. Do yourself a favor and try them!!! Also great wings and great food specials on different days as well. 
Just a great little neighborhood spot for a good bite to eat and hangout with some good friends. Also, if the weather is nice, try siting on the rooftop, the view is just great!"}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with some friends while working in the Charlotte area. It was a nice crowd with a good mix of people from younger to older. I went on a Saturday night and I enjoyed the rooftop bar and the music that they were playing. Overall it's a Great spot to go to in that part of Charlotte"}
{"text":"Great food. Drink specials are pretty solid. The service is very hit or miss. Sometimes it's great, but more often than not, when we order food from upstairs its cold by the time we get it. And sometimes the service is slow."}
{"text":"Well, it seems the potential for upscale whiskey bar is being squandered on the frattiest crowd ever to descend on Plaza/Midwood (which is saying a lot, considering the crowd TST draws). Since the cask beer is my main reason for coming here - and its seldom on tap - I'm giving up. 

The parking in this area has always been tight but its been taken to a whole other level of screwed since WW opened. Harris Teeter and CVS have put towing programs into effect because patrons of this joint (and hey, others too, but no one really complained until, coincidentally, right after WW opened) are too lazy to park in the municipal lots scattered around the 'hood. Watch out driving by the place in the wee hours, too - you'll inevitably be lunged at by Turd Ferguson and the Misses, thinking you're the cab they called. Idiots."}
{"text":"Whiskey Warehouse is a great place for spring/summer to hang out on the rooftop balcony. It's always busy and with an eclectic group of people, all nice. There are also several televisions to catch whatever sport is on tv. In this case, it was March Madness. You WILL struggle to find a table and pretty much have to stalk one to wait for people to get up or just make friends while they're sitting there. I had the special of the day on my last trip, which were shrimp skewers over rice with spinach and tomatoes. It wasn't anything special, but filling and with enough lemon spice to forego salt and pepper. Whiskey punch is also pretty good. Come for the sun, new friends, and drinks. Parking is terrible in Plaza Midwood in general, so be prepared to deal with it."}
{"text":"Amazing service by our waitress,Tiff. She was very attentive and nice. Food was great, awesome atmosphere and you can get a pitcher of jack and coke!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest- I love Whiskey's rooftop and the $4 Jack. Not a big whiskey drinker but I always order it while I'm here. The food is not good here. I've order several items and they're literally a waste of money. The tenders are always soft never crispy. The wings lack salt or any seasoning really. If you don't order them extra crispy some will be undone. The burgers also have no flavor. I'll continue to come here and I'm still going to give them 3 stars but the food is a waste of money and time. It's still love tho"}
{"text":"We had so many problems this night I won't go back. It's a cool vibe, but the food was awful and the customer service was just as bad. We both got sandwiches. Both were cold and soggy. My sandwich was underwhelming even if it was hot. The fries were also cold and soggy. They messed up our side orders. Just BAD food all around! When we complained they did not care or do anything. So many better places in Plaza!"}
{"text":"If you are a female don't expect service. The Asian girl won't even mAke contact with you. Only nice girl was a bar back who couldn't get my beer but hovered the bartenders to attempt to get my beer. Girl bartenders suck!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and overall the food and service has been good.  The outside deck is really cool and the $4 jack drinks are awesome too.  The beer selection is also really nice."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a cool looking place with a decent kitchen such a bad review but the service isn't too great. 
A friend and I went for dinner last night and had no wait, around roughly 7/730, for a great little rooftop table. The server arrived late, didn't know the bar menu or restaurant menu, and kind of rushed us into choosing our food. I ordered a beer and the prime rib and baked potato. At least ten minutes later she comes back to explain they only have the prime on Thursdays, but I can get the strip - which, it turns out later, is $7 more; she failed to mention that and I didn't have the menu any longer to see what was what. THEN another server comes over- it turns out, \"Haley\" is on her last night of training and her trainer explains that, not only do they not have prime but they only have baked potatoes on Thursdays. Thursday's must be the time to visit. So the trainer offers us mashed potatoes instead. I agree, but tell her I'm frustrated I didn't know it was only Thursdays and she very snappily tells me something to the extent that \"it's there above the steak special....it says Thursday special... We run out of it on Thursday.\" Like I'm supposed to intuitively know that something offered on your special, single page house menu isn't offered all week. The food comes out way later, second round of drinks takes extra long considering our proximity to the bar/the number of bartenders/number of people on the rooftop. 
My steak is overdone but I keep it because the trainee tells me my friend will be done with her food by the time I get my steak the way I ordered it. The Trainer brings us god awful shots as restitution- we don't drink them bc they are some alcohol they probably can't sell and literally have to give away. 
The manager NEVER checks on us- unless the manager is some older dude with grey hair- he came by and touched our table as he walked by, not looking at us and asked us how we were- never breaking gait, never looking at us. All this before we had food, too. 
Our bill comes, and my originally 14$ prime turned strip is now 21$, and I say something to the trainer who looks at me like I have two heads, like my steak was what I ordered originally and the right temperature, and she tells me she'll have to talk to the manager to see what they can do because, \" this is unprecedented, no one has ever asked us to do this before.\" 
She comes back with a $3 discount and I'm so fed up I just leave it alone, pay, and leave.  
I am a server/trainer at a steakhouse. There's never a time when I don't follow my trainee around, even on last days, to make sure my customers are getting everything they need/all the info needed/ and that my trainee can see how to resolve conflict. I never speak condescendingly to my table about things they may have missed on the menu/ food we're out of. You do everything you can to make sure food someone is paying for is right.
I'm never going back there again. It had so much potential and the waitstaff and management killed whatever there could have been. For the record, the mash and asparagus were great, and the strip wasn't terrible (great cut!) for a m/w. But service is everything."}
{"text":"Wings are usually really good. But if you are a fan of HOT wings, the Suicide wings are more like I scratched my wrist for attention wings."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is friendly, and the food is excellent. The French fries are addictive, but if you want to save some calories the salmon salad is one of my favorites. They now serve brunch on Sundays with a do it yourself Bloody Mary Bar. I have never had a bad meal here, and since its next to my place, I eat here a lot! They also have a great wine list, and bear selection if your not a whiskey drinker. If you are a whiskey drinker try the Jack and Coke slushy. Can't be beat on a hot NC day! Great place for sports fans to watch the game!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review based off drinks alone.  I didn't order any food but the atmosphere is a lot of fun.  Be sure to go on a sunny day and sit on the roof top patio.  Cool vibes and great for a small group of friends.  It gets pretty crowded on the weekends so get there early (if you're day drinking) or maybe call ahead.  Very cool place and excited to hang out there this summer!"}
{"text":"One of the best place I've been to here in CLT! Went once in a Monday got wings and they were amazing and went another time for the same and they were just as good. But went to brunch today and it was amazing I loved it. Everything was on point mimosas were beyond great. I'll be back again soon"}
{"text":"Good selection of drinks. Food was decent for bar food, but at 10 pm they cranked the music to a volume so loud I could hardly hear my friends across the table. Waited a while for service as well. Solid meh."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but food and beer are pricey for what you get. Great for game watching since they have a ton of TVs. Tables are really close together which makes it hard to navigate the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was poor, food came out at different times for our group, some of our party received incorrect orders. Food runner was unapologetic about mistakes. Most of the food was mediocre. Fun atmosphere, but only good for wings and drinks."}
{"text":"They have a pretty solid list of whiskey. I really enjoy the idea of whiskey flights too. They usually have good drinks specials too. 

If we are going to Plaza Midwood for brunch this is the first place we will go to. They have a lot of options and all for a decent price.

There are tons of tvs and the upper roof deck is awesome when the weather is right. They even will run heaters when it starts getting cooler. It has an awesome view of the skyline and another full bar up top too. 

They also show ufc fights and not many places do that around town without charging. I would definitely recommend WW! Just be aware that they do get busy come weekend time so expect a little wait."}
{"text":"S-L-O-W. By far the slowest service I've ever had in any restaurant. From the drink order, to letting me know my drink wasn't available, to taking our order, & then the longest wait...getting the food! We waited about an hour for wings. WINGS! And we were one of the few people eating here. Super empty. We had ordered other things & literally asked for boxes bc we were just over it by the time it arrived. Oh & btw, one of those items was a cold salad requiring no cooking. We were also disappointed that their rooftop was closed until 4. I will say the long awaited wings tasted pretty good, but even that is not enough to bring me back here. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Whiskey Warehouse could be a cool little joint if they offered a better beer selection and higher quality food. Decided to meet up with an out of town visitor for the skyline views at Whiskey this week. Unfortunately the awesome view wasn't enough to make up for the overpriced mediocre beer and subpar food. 

Ordered the nachos on special during half priced apps (4-6) and what we  received was stale chips with under seasoned queso and a few slices of jalapeños with diced tomatoes. Pretty uninspired to be honest and definitely not worth the regular price of $11. 

I would like to say I wouldn't return, but for some reason others seem to enjoy the rooftop bar enough to ignore the subpar food/overpriced drinks and I'm sure it won't be long before I begrudgingly return."}
{"text":"Not blown away, but they do have a pretty great rooftop bar, and plenty of TVs around for viewing whatever game you please. It was admittedly a great choice to watch UNC barely beat the Razorbacks.
They have a relatively standard selection of beer, and unfortunately their menu wasn't updated at all when we went there and several taps were completely empty.Service was great the whole night though!

I ordered the spicy teryaki wings, and I think that I have several personal preferences that were not met: I do like a thicker sauce (this one was watery), I get a bit upset when I see entire halves of wings not covered in sauce (this means they weren't tossed and the sauce was just drizzled on), and I also like crispy skin (this was definitely soggy). But the meat was hot and there was a fair amount of it! 
I also ordered a side of fries and holy cow those were DRENCHED in grease and totally soggy. Every single one of them. And there wasn't any salt either...

So although the food was on the lower side of OK, I did enjoy the atmosphere, and I'll continue to come here... I may have just come on an off day. I'll come back and try more things, and hopefully be able to bump up my experience."}
{"text":"Great bar in plaza midwood. Very much enjoyed the deck with the view of the city. Went for a late lunch on a Sunday, had decent mimosa specials as many other restaurants nearby. Service for food was a little slow, as there seemed to be one server for every table on the deck. Could have maybe used a little more help but otherwise the food and drinks were delicious."}
{"text":"Fun but raucous bar where you can definitely get your whiskey on (including tasting flights) with attractive and flirty waitstaff. Get the fried pimento cheese balls and the salt and pepper pork rinds to go with your drinks. If the weather permits go upstairs to the rooftop area where you can get a nice breeze while you take in Charlotte's atmosphere and party culture."}
{"text":"This is a bar you'll want to visit to watch a game. There are plenty of huge tv's. 

Had a drink at the bar while we waited for takeout. I thought the old fashioned would be amazing at a whiskey warehouse. There was still granulated sugar in the glass. Dan was told the beers on tap were $4 but was charged $5.50.

Food was okay. Fish and chips and the veg burger. I'd not order again but would try something else.

We would stop by again when back in town."}
{"text":"The hubs and I came here for a late lunch on Sunday.  We had meant to arrive earlier, but our neighbor Hippie Mike paid us an unexpected visit.  For hours.  Nevertheless, it was a beautiful partly cloudy day with non wilting temperatures, so we headed for the rooftop.  
To our delight, they were playing blues music.  But, soon after our arrival, it switched to the worst rock of the 90's/turn of the century, except for one song by Velvet Revolver.
Our drink orders were promptly taken, and we settled in to enjoy the magnificent view.  Everyone in Charlotte needs to come to this rooftop at least once.
My husband ordered the talapia sandwich, which he said was ok.  It was fried, and he would have preferred it baked.  But my meal?  Holy herbivore!  I got the fried green tomato sandwich (and yes, I welcomed fried with open arms.). The bun had a smear of pimento cheese on it, too.  Yum!  Our orders came with fries, which was fine by me.
I have to say it was well worth listening to Hippie Mike's monologue  of righteous opinions to have this late lunch as my reward."}
{"text":"Whiskey Warehouse is THE place to be on Thursday nights, if you're looking for a relaxing evening after work. Wine is offered as a special at half the price (sangria excluded!) I love to sit downstairs at the bar and chat it up with Margeoux (could be spelling it wrong) SHE'S AWSOME!  She makes the best sangria hands down! GO SEE HER. The food is always on point and the service matches. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Waitress was nice and allowed me and my dinner guest to chat and order when we were ready. The beer was good."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and waffles for brunch, as I have many times and today they cut back on the chicken.  Normally it has always been two chicken fingers on the waffle with sausage gravy, today they cut a chicken finger in half.... Really is half a chicken finger a thing.  You lost my business and I have eaten here for years"}
{"text":"After two lunch visits I am still not blown away with Whiskey Warehouse. Yes, they have a great roof top patio, however, the service is hit or miss and the food is okay.
I have had different items each visit, chicken sandwich and today a burger.  The burger is served with lettuce and tomato and choice of cheese. I ordered swiss and asked for red onions. Came with the wrong cheese and no onions. After reminding my server she said she would grab them and never returned.  I also sat with an empty water until the bill arrived.
My friend got the salmon salad today, which came with no dressing. Once the dressing arrived he said it was okay.
The place was packed, yes, it was lunch time, but overall nothing I would run back to.  Stick to enjoying a cocktail on the patio and maybe grabbing some wings or appetizers."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SERVES FOOD!!!!!

My group came here for main intention witch is whiskey.  And Whiskey we had....and had.....and had.   I love the selection of whiskeys.  They have Makers 47!

The bartenders were awesome and so easy when they have the same name"}
{"text":"The Good: half priced wings on Monday. $4 jack everyday and the rooftop. 

Ok. I once really liked this place, mostly for the rooftop deck and tv screens. Then the last 4-5 times have been atrocious. I kept going back hoping it was an anomaly, but at this point my friends and I just find it laughable when we come home after a bad experience there. 

Service is so hit or miss; unfortunately, the waitresses are handcuffed by what is clearly a kitchen in disarray. The food always takes forever, rarely comes out right and almost always cold or undercooked. 

I'm glad to be moving out of the area and give my business to someone else."}
{"text":"3-star is generous, it's more like 2.5-star for my recent visit on Thursday  to meet friends for drinks.  The place was pretty packed for 9pm.  The 4 of us got some appetizers.  Nachos was HORRIBLE.  For $8, it definitely did not worth the price.  Can't believe I'm going to say this, but I would rather go to Taco Hell (I mean Bell) and get nacho there.  The pimento cheese spread was ok, look a little odd since it was mostly shredded cheese.  It had a little kick to it.  Not sure tortilla chips is the best companion for it... The best was the fried cheese balls.  

We ordered wine that night, it was half-price bottle night.  Same as my original review, nothing to complain about the drinks.  

Now on to service.  It was fine for the most part.  And just when you think something improved, one of the 3 waitresses that served our table (and she acted like she's the more \"senior\" of the 3) came over at 11ish, stopped us in the middle of our conversation and asked if we could tap out because she would much rather go home.  REALLY?!  Here's a news flash: how about get your rude & lazy butt home and let someone else finish out our table and get the tips that you obviously didn't deserve.  I worked in restaurants before, I waited tables, so I'm not just talking out of a pie hole with no merit.  That just totally rubbed me the wrong way.  

All these months later, food was still so-so (super sub-par for nacho... a bar food staple that's really not hard to master) and the service still needed improvement."}
{"text":"I enjoy Whiskey Warehouse and come here often when my fiance wants a good bloody mary bar at his fingertips. While I do come here mostly to grab a drink and walk around Plaza Midwood, I have grabbed a bite or two before. The big fish sandwich is delicious (even though I got it bun-less) It was large, crispy, and definitely hit the spot. The wings are good as well, though once my lemon pepper ones, were a little too lemony for my taste, but good overall. In short we keep coming back for the atmosphere and drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great location. We tried sitting on the rooftop, all seats were taken- get there early if you're planning to stay just for dinner. Had the teriyaki chicken, husband had the burger with fries. Teriyaki chicken was so delicious, may have been better than any hibachi restaurant version I've had. Husband said the fries were some of the best he's had... ever. Quality, local beer and great service. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good ole Whiskey Warehouse. First time I came here was 3 years ago when I got home from Iraq. I had not been to plaza mid-wood in years. Not a bad spot for catching up with old friends. They do have some good food as well. My favorite was walking in there on a Sunday picking up to go food for a sick friend. Food was not ready and I had to wait. They had a lovely Bloody Mary bar set up to which I helped myself to while I waited. Pretty clever I will say. They also have music on the weekends and for a bar, they get a thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"I got the brussel sprouts appetizer and boneless garlic parmesan wings. The flavoring for the brussel sprouts was delicious but the brussel sprouts were pretty hard still and could have been cooked longer. The boneless garlic parmesan wings were by far the best wings I have ever had. The chicken was tender and they melted Parmesan cheese on top of the wings. Usually when I order garlic Parmesan wings they come dripping in sauce and the breading is soggy. The breading was crispy and appeared to have very little sauce but they had a lot of flavor. I liked them so much I order them to go again the next day."}
{"text":"The view and atmosphere in the rooftop bar area is great. 

The food and drink are average(not bad), but I cannot speak for the whiskey, bc I don't like it in general."}
{"text":"The food here never disappoints, but sitting downstairs inside, we might as well be outside with the number of flies and gnats flying around our food..."}
{"text":"I came in this afternoon to watch the Panthers game with some friends. A lot of people have told me that Whiskey Warehouse has some of the best wings in the city so I thought I'd give them a try. I tried the hot wings, and I thought they were way too mild and lacking in flavor. Personally, I prefer the wings at Moosehead or Lebowskis, but whatever, they were OK i guess.

Aside from the food being pretty forgettable, though, the service that we received was very good. Our server's name was Megan, and she was very friendly and attentive throughout the whole experience. She checked in regularly to make sure we had all the food and drinks we needed throughout the game.

Overall, I thought Whiskey Warehouse had a nice atmosphere for watching football on Sundays, with plenty of TVs and a good selection of beers on tap, so I would gladly come back to drink and watch sports here. That being said, with all the other excellent food options elsewhere in Plaza Midwood, I may get food somewhere else beforehand next time."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to meet some friends to watch the patriots play the eagles(Superbowl)... i have actually been here before during the summer, they have this cool rooftop tiki bar environment at the top of climbing the  stairs here.I didn't get much here just a appetizer and a drink. Ordered the fried pimento cheese balls they were good but just a little overkill with the amount of cheese geesh. My drink was everything under the sun the cucumber mango mule,this drink was so refreshing and the alcohol level was just right in it not too much and not too little and i had two. Want to start coming here more in the warm weather when i can sit out on the rooftop."}
{"text":"I'm a tad overdue on my update. Several visits later and Whiskey isn't has horrible as the rep it seems to have accrued. Yes the fratty crowd hasn't changed much, but it's quite an eclectic fratty crowd. 

My last visit was for the UFC fight and I got lots of free schwag. Free schwag, whaaa!? Bud light sponsored the event and gave us free hats, key chain can openers, t-shirts, bottle sleeve/glove coozy thingy and free beer! Free beer, whaaa?

The drink specials are decent, $3 for OMB Copper on Saturday nights at a place that looks this new and nice?? That's a steal. Food isn't too shabby either. Good fried green tomatoes, decent wings, decent Mac n Cheese, and the barrel burger is pretty fulfilling and rad. What is the barrel burger you say? Well my friend, it's a tasty meat patty topped with chili and a fried egg of course!

The DJ still plays a lil' too much Kesha and crap though."}
{"text":"Joined a couple of friends on the rooftop for cocktails & apps this past weekend for my first visit.  It's my new favorite haunt.  Wish it were larger to accommodate all the adoring patrons, which by the way were fairly diverse in age which was nice.  (Although there were no children which I thought was appropriate considering it's mainly a bar.)   Although we only ordered basic bar food and a salad, all was good.  Drinks were not ridiculously overpriced which in Charlotte is a rarity.  The atmosphere is cool & cozy, the sunset view is beautiful, the service was good (bar service was stellar, table service less so but fine), and the strategically placed fans were much appreciated.  Oh, and the 80s music rocked.  Thoughtful owners.  I'll be back, again and again.  Hopefully it will remain a great experience."}
{"text":"Amazing experience from start to finish. We called to see if kids were okay to bring, and they were super friendly over the phone (& definitely kid friendly). Upon getting there we had a brief wait, but were greeted and updated by their friendly staff. The food was great, the service was great, and the atmosphere was fun! We will definitely be back for more (although because of the kids we mostly order in their wings and pretzels ) Can't wait to check it out on the roof top! Oh, and did I mention how friendly everyone is?!?"}
{"text":"I had a great time here but it had nothing to do with the bar. It's one peg up from an average sports bar, with Whiskey in the name to try and make it feel New Southern Hip. It doesn't work, but in their favor the $3.50 microbrew special ain't bad."}
{"text":"Not at all what I hoped this place would be. With a title like \"whiskey warehouse\" I was thinking of a place that would be small, quiet, and maybe even have a fireplace in the corner. But I should've known better. It's a typical loud sports bar that happens to have a wide selection of whiskey and scotch. 

That being said I'm giving it three stars because the staff was nice and the place was well kept and clean. It's just not what I expected which is more of a personal problem than a critique."}
{"text":"I've received great feedback about the wings at Whiskey warehouse so I placed an order for wings for my latest event. Needless to say my guests thought the wings were ok at best. There were not crunchy, actually quite soggy and I was expecting the the Jack Daniels bbq flavor to actually taste and look like bbq.
I will say the buffalo chicken dip was awesome!!! It was a hit and didn't last long. I should of ordered more dip and less wings."}
{"text":"I frequently visit Whiskey. Not only do I love the food but the service is amazing. Mischa always makes it point to come over and see how we're doing. Best neighborhood bar there is!!!"}
{"text":"A great place to watch the game.

Many 60 inch HD plasmas with great sight lines about anywhere you sit.

They have the usual selection of pub grub.
The fries are better than average."}
{"text":"Whiskey warehouse is a great bar ANY day of the week. The drink specials are cheap and plentiful ($4 jack all most all the time) and they usually are well staffed with well trained, well mannered servers. It's in a part of Charlotte that is growing with new housing and cool bars/dives every week. The ambience is the regular sports bar with a bit more room for larger parties and sit down eating on the main level. On the second level -my personal favorite- is the patio! Equipped with plenty of tv's, lots of table top seating, bar stool options, a nice view of downtown and an added bonus is that they have bathrooms upstairs so you don't have to go up and down while having drinks. Also the bathrooms are not a run down toilet shack but really well put together. They have great food options and the wings are amazing !"}
{"text":"I had to come here to update my review after visiting Whisky Warehouse multiple times this year for brunch and other weekend day drinking activities. My visits as of late have been awesome! The food was always good to me, it was the service that needed improving to make this place awesome and it did! I always sit at the bar when visiting and the bartenders are always attentive and sweet. Inside and at the outside patio upstairs it's been great. This is now added to my rotation of favorite brunches. Plus that amazing view..."}
