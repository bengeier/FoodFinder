{"text":"The Tartine with Avocado and smoked salmon was delicious! I definitely recommend it to those who have a huge craving for avocado&tomatoes because they sure do pile them. The Pain Perdu with Grilled cheese was amazing. It is the perfect combination for people who love salty breakfasts with a hint of sweetness. The food was great but the service needed improvement. It took a bit of time before we got greeted and set up to a table when there weren't many tables occupied. I would say that there was about 4 tables."}
{"text":"Pretty impressive spot. Amazing deco, and great vibe in this restaurant. Vintage European and french style. Its a Brasserie Francaise. I've been there for breakfast. I had the Assiète du Theatre plate. Its was non tasty and just very regular. For a 19$ plate, coffee non included, you are expecting a lot more. The meats (sausages and ham) were okay, but nothing WOW. Maybe just a bad morning for them. I would give it a second try for sure, maybe more for dinner."}
{"text":"Peppermint sticks, candied cinnamon hearts or speckled pre-Valentine's Day- nothing screams French bistro about Le Café du Théatre. It is my second time here, we were seated quickly for a table of 2 on a Sunday afternoon. Our waitress was thorough in explaining the current daily specials. The menu was divided up in resto week style, presenting different 3 course meal options for a certain price. I opted for a chai latté that was rather large and very sugared. My date insisted on a cheese/charcuterie plate (with a latté? I know odd!?) I thought the plate was interesting, however I have had better in other locations (including bier markt-build your own charcuterie plate). The mustard seeds with selected cuts of meat was actually a very nice touch. I wasn't too crazy about the date purée spread. The liver paté was nice, the toasted bread that came with it was too hard.  Overall, I didn't fancy this place but location in dix30 was convenient and accessible to most."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes anywhere.  Excellent coffee, breakfast and lunch.  Yes three service is not rushed, but its part of the French experience. They have a traditional Canadian breakfast.  Eggs come with bead, beans, fruit, meat and potatoes.  The second morning I ordered the crepe of the day as I was pressed for time.  I got in and out in 25 minutes by letting the server know I was in a hurry.  Three crepe of the day its huge. I wish I had someone to share it with because I could only eat half."}
{"text":"Super brunch, les plats signature sont excellent! Vous ne devez pas être pressé par contre. Aussi, calculer 50$ minimum pour 2, donc un peu cher pour le déjeuner, mais bon, c'est le dix 30."}
{"text":"Went to have breakfast with family. The food was good but service was mediocre. Had to ask multiple times to get coffee cream (they keep giving us milk instead - I guess there was misunderstanding somehow). It took a really long time to get our bill also. I think if you want to spend 2h there, it would be okay but for me service was too slow."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and coffee!!! That's all I can say....  because you just have come and try for yourself.  Oh yeah service was great also.  I'm just so happy right now"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with the beef tartare. It's missing something. 2 other colleagues tried the salmon and the summer tartares and both were equally unimpressed. They are also cheap on the bread that serve with it. (3 slices -which is not enough to spread all the tartare on) when I asked for more they gladly obliged. Another colleague tried the lobster guedille and said it was mayonnaise heavy. The coffee is good however."}
{"text":"While I love french food, I don't like to eat at beat down dark dingy places serving food for price of gold. Not sure what so romantic about a place where you can't even see your food. Cafe theatre is quite the opposite, its bright, trendy and kid friendly. Servers are very inviting and the food really good. I had the veal liver, it was amazing, melted like butter. Do try the snail, it was different from what I expected but really really good. I will surely visit this place again."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant! Went here because it's near home and I wanted to try something new and I was not disappointed! I ordered the \"tartine avocat et saumon\" and it was delicious. Egg was cooked perfectly and the smoked salmon was really fresh. My boyfriend ordered a plate that had egg, sausage and pancakes and it was really tasty as well. Pretty good service but I asked for more milk since they refilled my coffee and never ended up bringing me any, but they were pretty busy so it wasn't a big deal. Friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"Never again, such a dissapointing experience. I ordered a dish on their menu called \"Papardelle Vegetarian\" because it was the only plate on the menu that seemed vege/meatless. To my surprise when the plate came, I was biting into a flesh of something. I quickly called the waitress to let her know and sincerely apologized for the mistake I made of assuming that there wasn't any meat in the dish. She told me not to worry at all and that there was a VEGETARIAN option for this plate and that she was going to order it right away. When the plate came, I ended up finishing 2/3 of it, and asked to bring the rest home. When I got home after a party later that night, I warmed the leftover plate up as a midnight snack. A few bites in, and I noticed a huge piece of meat in my plate!!! I was sincerely disappointed by this work ethic and their lack of respect and care for the dietary restrictions of their clientele. Very amateur and this place should not be supported!"}
{"text":"I would say that I am a fan of this place. I only came here once for breakfast before Osheaga, but the location was beautiful. Their bathrooms are beautifully decorated and when you walk up the stairs to get to them you get this great view of the entire restaurant! I wanted to take a picture but I forgot my cell phone.   For drinks we tried the Mimosa and the Fruit Smoothie (they only have one). I would get the fruit smoothie again it was amazing. The mimosa was good but kind of boring.   I got the \"l'assiette Café du Théâtre\" and my friend got the Eggs Benedict. The plate that I tried is basically an assortment of different types of food - eggs, ham, bacon, beef, fruit, a ham and cheese sandwhich, and hashbrowns. It was pretty good.   It wasn't crazy expensive but it's not a cheap breakfast place. Expect to pay around $30 per person. That being said the service was decent and the staff was helpful when we needed a translator or suggestions on what to eat. I was pretty full after.   Their patio looks over the Brossard shopping centre. It's a very trendy spot in Montreal."}
{"text":"Horrendous service.  30 mins to order a drink and about 45 min to run after waiter to pay for it.  Had to stand up and walked to cashier to beg to pay for bill and just to find out the waiter saying there was bill of more than 175$ to be paid.  Finally a nice lay had to intervene and clear off all the confusion."}
{"text":"5 étoiles pour ce magnifique restaurant au cur du quartier DIX-30! J'insiste tout d'abord sur le mot MAGNIFIQUE, puisque des qu'on entre dans le resto, on se sent transportés. Le décor est sublime. Je m'y suis rendue un vendredi matin puisque j'avais une formation au Alt Hôtel du quartier DIX-30 et que j'y avais logé la veille. Le resto, a quelques pas, me semblait être une excellente option. Je me suis assise au comptoir et j'ai dégusté un super café latte et la tartine de saumon fumé et avocat. DÉLICIEUX. COPIEUX. L'assiette est composée d'une tranche de pain multigrains, d'une généreuse portion d'écrasé d'avocat, de saumon fumé, d'un uf poché, de tomates cerises et de fromage aux fines herbes. J'ai adoré mon plat. Généreux et léger à la fois. Parfait pour attaquer une autre journée de formation! Niveau prix, on parle de autour de 5$ pour le café et autour de 20$ pour le plat. J'ai déjà envie dy retourner!!"}
