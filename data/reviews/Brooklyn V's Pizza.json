{"text":"Great little gem of a place. I was getting my daughter's car worked on and needed a place to eat. The guys at the repair shop suggested Brooklyn V's which was a short walk; boy am I glad they did! When I walked in I was greeted by Desiree (whom I later found out was one of the owners) with a pleasant smile and was told I could sit where I liked. I found a nice table and ordered a stromboli. Now, I'm originally from Philly where, when I was a kid, had stromboli all the time, but I hadn't had one in 25 years. Let me tell you, I picked the best place to have my first stromboli in 25 years!!! This thing was a beast; stuffed full of Italian sausage, meatballs, pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. And the marinara on the side; forget about it!!! I could only eat half, but took the rest home to my wife who devoured it later that night! All in all I had a fantastic experience and highly recommend going to see Desiree at this wonderful place!!!"}
{"text":"We moved from NYC 3.5 years ago and could not find authentic pizza, not to mention cannolis. I found Brooklyn Vs on here (yelp) and due to the great reviews decided to try.... YUM YUM YUM. We had the white eggplant pizza, margherita pizza and garlic knots ALL DELICIOUS. As we were getting ready to leave Vito the owner came over and said hello. We told him we could not find good cannolis anywhere, even though we had paid our bill he brought us a few cannolis for us to try... How thoughtful! We will definitely be back to try other things on the menu"}
{"text":"What a find!  We gave this place a try after hearing from others how good it was and getting a discount through Local Flavor.  We had been to a pizza place that was previously in this location which wasn't very good, so we were skeptical.  Everything about our first meal here was absolutely fantastic.  Even though they were quite busy the evening we dined here, the waitress was very attentive and extremely nice....thanks very much Anna!  Between myself, my wife and daughter, we tried a number of different menu items including the garlic cheese knots, chicken parmesan, pizza and a salad....everything was VERY good.  We definitely have plans to return.  Nice to see a very well ran family business with such good food!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding!  The restaurant was very cozy for both a family or date night event.  We enjoyed talking to Vito who is the owner of the restaurant.  He and his staff make you feel right at home.  Make sure to meet Des and Kerry if you go eat there!  We will definitely start making it one of our family top places to go eat!"}
{"text":"New York Style Pizza.. a dream in the desert they say, but not so with Brooklyn V's Pizza.  Ordered a Pizza and a Stromboli and both were out of this world.  Samantha was excellent and came a few times to see if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Came from San Tan Valley to see if this NY style pizza lived up to my Brooklyn memories.  Best pizza I've tasted in the last 10 years.  I ordered a garlic pie. To die for."}
{"text":"Excellent food and Excellent service. Hopefully you will get Anna as a waitress, she will make your experience that much better. It makes you feel like you're in New York restaurant."}
{"text":"Is my go to Italian food place in Gilbert. The Chicken Marsala, chicken Parmesan and the chicken fettuccine Alfredo are my top 3 favorite dishes. The salad is crisp and cool. The little bread loaves that come with the meals are just so hot and fresh. The staff is always attentive and friendly. Prices are good for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Great chicken parm. tonight, they forgot my side Caesar though. I gave five stars on my first review."}
{"text":"The Strombolis are out of this world.  The food is excellent fresh ingredients and generous portions.     Family friendly and great service.  You won't leave hungry.  Good food, good people, good value.  Check it out."}
{"text":"I am suspicious of the rave reviews on this place.  I went in on a Sunday at 1 pm.  There were no other customers in the place.  I purchased a pizza to take home.  The toppings were generous but the crust was not impressive and the sauce had no seasoning.  I took it home and was able to add some garlic seasoning.  I also have issues when the cheese does not cover to the edge of the pizza.  Some slices had a good two inches of just crust and tasteless sauce.  Not worth $20 for a 14 inch pizza.  The Sinatra/Bing Crosby music was not energetic and made the empty restaurant seem even weirder."}
{"text":"absolutely the worst customer service I have ever had , we did arrive a little before closing on a Sunday night a bunch of our friends told us how great it was and we made our order. the gal taking our order was less than pleased that we came in so close to closing , but when we got home our order was total incorrect.  I called the restaurant just to have a snotty little gal say nothing and then pass the buck  then no apology then gave me to the manager I think ?Carey who was terribly rude said his Cooks were gone 1st then said No his cook was having beers and would remake our food really? and when I said no I didn't want a cook who was drinking remaking my food and  and I had to come back and pick up my order he said I cant help you man I am going to hang up on you now.  REALLY???  if I ran my business this way I wouldn't have a business anymore (maybe they shouldn't???. I asked for the Owner He said he was not in big shocker and he would call me back  it was Vito lets see if I really get a call back . They were rude condescending offered  nothing but store credit  on the dinner my daughter didn't get , no compensation , no compassion only store credit Really? I am in customer service and will be telling EVERYONE I know how rude these people were and so is my wife so much for a family neighborhood business!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and fantastic stromboli. The pepperoni is spicy and flavorful! The service is excellent."}
{"text":"yay!!! one of the best italian restaurants in az!!! tried new queen creek location today and was not disapponted!!! phenomenal italian meal!!! highy recommend to everyone looking for the real deal italian meal!!! a+ !."}
{"text":"Tonight my wife and I had the pleasure of ordering take out from Brooklyn V's! Being a true New Yorker and looking at how much food we received after ordering only two meals was astonishing! Big portions! Not to mention how amazing it tasted. Don't sleep on the garlic knots they are to die for!! Defiantly going back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - Amazing owners and staff! Atmosphere is \"Cheers\" like. If you are considering trying but unsure - have no fear - You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Vito and his staff are awesome. I love their pizza and they have the best antipasto salad anywhere. Everything my family has eaten there has been fantastic."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I have to say, we will be back!  Desiree was our server and she was fantastic, very friendly and attentive!  We were with friends and so started out with Bruschetta and a Stromboli as an appetizer which were excellent.  Then we ordered a pizza which was fantastic all while enjoying some great music performed by a small band.  Lastly we ordered desserts to share which included the Cannoli, Tiramisu and Oreo Cheesecake. all very good! Who knew this small out of the way place would be so great!"}
{"text":"Went there first time with my sons and the pizza is outstanding!  The only issue is we did not feel welcome, the service is excellent but the manager that day made visits to the other tables except ours, that i think is Not good buisness or good management! What am i? Chopped liver Lost my business and was planning to my it my regular pizza place,NOT NOW!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! I'm a total snob when it comes to Italian food as my family is from Sicily. Ivan already tell I'm going to become a regular at this place. We had the garlic knots, stuffed shells, and Calzone with sausage and pepperoni...everything was amazing!!! To top it off the owners brought us out some Cannoli's for dessert which were so good! Can't wait to come back and try the eggplant roltinni :)"}
{"text":"We treated our employees to lunch at Brooklyn V's. Diseree and Kelly flawlessly served a group of 10 people. But, the best part was the food. Everyone ordered a different item from the menu except for a couple that shared a pizza. The food was great! Their portions are big  so some of us had leftovers for later. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Closest to NY pizza you can find in AZ. Desiree was a great she always made sure we where taken care of. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Walked in, staff could have cared less. They stood in the way talking to friends at a table so we had to walk around to order at the counter. The pizza was so greasy and had a funny after taste,  I still don't feel good. Don't recommend at ALL!"}
{"text":"We're new to town, and as an east coast Italian I always have to check out the local Italian offerings.  Brooklyn Vs is the real deal.  We've already been back twice."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo, spaghetti with meat sauce along with a large pizza. Everything was great. I get fettuccine just about everywhere I go and theirs was some of the best. Pizza had a great thin and crispy crust. Great stuff."}
{"text":"You search for a real New York pizza, especially if you come from Brooklyn. This place comes thisclose. Vito has the \"touch\". The pizza is delicious. Their marinara is wonderful and the garlic knots are like Brooklyn's best. It was also amazing that there were a lot of N.Y. ex-pats the evening we were there."}
{"text":"Wife is a native New Yorker and I lived in NYC for a few years, so that's the baseline against which this restaurant is compared.  As you see, we have given a five star review to this restaurant, an indication that we feel that the restaurant is not only outstanding, but worth a special trip.  We started off with the honey BBQ wings, which were so hot that we had to wait before they could be picked up. Sauce perfect, not overdone, and the order came with homemade ranch dressing. Did not come with carrot sticks or celery, but don't know whether their absence was deliberate or unintentional. Either way, the wings were a hit.  Next, my wife got the two slice lunch special--she declared that it was perfect. Stated \"New #1 pizza,\" eclipsing her previous favorites (Sal's Gilbert Pizza and the long-gone Buono's). Slices were large, cheesy, crunchy. Her review: \"perfect.\"  Teenage son and I got large \"V's Three Meat\" pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs. Awesome pizza, we also agreed \"perfect\". Son liked the cheese pizza even better and said he'd probably order that on an upcoming visit.  Finally, we got the cannoli for desert. Three small ones, also absolutely perfect.  We met both the owner and the chef, who came out to greet us and say hello--very warm and welcoming guys. The waitress (Desiree) was very outgoing and friendly and clearly wants guests to enjoy their stay. Before we left, she gave us refill drinks in to-go cups and a loyalty membership card.   Restaurant kitchen appeared spotless, food was great, people were very friendly, service good, and prices were right. Grade A+"}
{"text":"Finally found REAL NY style pizza in the East Valley! The pizza Margherita and Eggplant parmesan Hero were delicious! The owners were very friendly and made us feel very welcome.  New Yorkers you gotta come here!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service and the pizza's very good. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We LOVE Brooklyn V's. We come here at least once a week. The food is amazing and the service is great. They have added some new girls so be patient, the food is worth the wait anyway. We pretty much have the menu memorized and I haven't eaten anything I haven't liked yet. They are also apart of a great rewards program where you can build up points and earn free food!"}
{"text":"Negative experience here last night. Service was not on point. Very unorganized staff, we had 3 servers and each one didn't know what the other was doing. Take out line strung into dining room next to our table. Food was bland, Alfredo was soupy, red sauce was watery on spaghetti very unskilled staff. Save your money and find a more authentic place."}
{"text":"I am originally from NYC and moved to Arizona close to 2 years ago. I found out about this place from a random New Yorker I met.   To say the least, this place is amazing. I go to Brooklyn V's all the time. I feel a price of home and nostalgia when I walk in. I spent about a year and a half trying to find good NY pizza and did not find it, until I went to Brooklyn V's. I won't eat any other pizza, except for theirs.   Not only do they have great pizza, they offer amazing pasta dishes, desserts, and their staff is the greatest.  I will always be a New Yorker and their food makes me miss/appreciate the NY style of food."}
{"text":"Got takeout on Saturday Night (9/27).  It was our first time ordering from them, so we decided to order a cheese pizza.  In my opinion, the true litmus test for any pizza is getting the pizza in it 's purest form, plain cheese. Well, Brooklyn V's passed this test with flying colors.  The sauce had great flavor and the crust had the right amount of crispness and chewiness.   We strive to support only locally owned restaurants, not chains. I love that this place is 2 minutes from our house.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their chicken pesto pizza is amazing. There's nothing on the menu you won't like!"}
{"text":"ate at the Queen Creek location had pizza and wings,good pizza and the wings are also good busy place with dine in and take out,lots of tvs (5) for the size of the restaurant crowded parking lot shares with a auto repair place and a dairy queen glad i had a local eats coupon will go back and try some other dishes"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, & I just had dinner at Brooklyn V's for first time. Desiree was our waitress she was really helpful, & adaptive. Having a 3 year old going to dinner is always easy. Desiree brought out the coloring books & crayons for our daughter & got our daughters order in ahead of ours which worked out great.   The pizzas were really good. The crust was crispy & pizzas all had good flavors. Everything is fresh there. I look at the service we got, the food that we ate I would absolutely recommend Brooklyn V's. My daughter & wife agree with me. We will be back to get our pictures on the wall for their rewards program."}
{"text":"Went to Brooklyn V's last night for dinner for the first time with my family.  I was intrigued because they were from Staten Island so I figured they knew good pizza.  It is hard to find a good \"pie\" out in AZ.  The restaurant did not disappoint.  We had the Margherita and the White Eggplant Pizza's.  They we amazing. The dough was light and thin. The sauce was perfect. Not to thick and acidic. The eggplant pizza is a must.  I can't wait to go back again and try the dinner selections.   The staff was so friendly.  It actually felt like a \"family\".  Highly recommended.   They deliver and cater also!"}
{"text":"Freaking terrible!! They sent me the wrong pizza then when I called to get it fixed they told me I was wrong !!!!that came from the owner!! I will make sure everyone knows how they really feel about their customers !!  F YI Brooklyn V Pizza the customer is always right it's call customer service !!! Heard of it!!!??? Obviously not! And my husband said the pizza was soggy and flavorless as he was the only one who got to eat dinner ! I only wish this app allowed for NO stars!! Unbelievable ..."}
{"text":"First off the staff was adorable. Their passion for the food and the quaint little place was wonderful. Now food. Oh Brooklyn V you nailed it. The perfect NY pizza fold was preformed on our three meats pizza delicious. I make my own ricotta so when I tasted the eggplant and ricotta pizza I knew these folks are serious about quality. We had left over and I woke up at 6 am to run down stairs to have pizza for breakfast. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Brooklyn V's opened 3 weeks ago and is having typical start-up issues with a new young staff. But, that's the only area that needs improvement! I wanted to try Brooklyn V's because as I was sitting at the stop light at Lindsey and Warner - the most wonderful pizza aroma drifted across the intersection. I told my husband, based on the aroma alone we needed to try this place. The FOOD IS WONDERFUL and definitely lived up to the tantalizing aroma!  We ordered house salads and the Sausage and Pepper Stromboli. We didn't receive the Stromboli we ordered, however we kept the dish brought because the crust was so crispy and light, the cheese was perfectly stringy and gooey, and the combination of meats inside tender and tasty. Paired with their marinara sauce, we couldn't send it back - it was that good! One of the owners stopped by to check on our dinner. When we let her know what happened, she \"comped\" us Cannolis for dessert. The plate was chilled and the presentation was something I would have expected from a more upper end restaurant. We are so glad to have Brooklyn V's in our neighborhood and within walking distance! We'll be returning again and again to try the other items on the menu - which we expect will be equally flavorful."}
{"text":"Great service, great pizza, but excellent pasta.  It's a weekly tradition for me and my family to grab a meal from here whether it's to go or dinning in.  Please don't pass on the knots, spaghetti, baked ziti, wings, or the old classic pepperoni pizza.  For those who like a different ambiance make a trip out on Friday or Saturday night.  Live music!!!  Need I say more???"}
{"text":"I have been a customer since they opened. Vito and Bob have provided an eating establishment that is absolutely first class, using high quality products and wonderful authentic New York inspired recipes. I have had several of their menu items and have never been disappointed. Their pizzas are delicious, especially the bruschetta. The penne pasta with vodka sauce is the absolute best. Chicken marsala is mouth-watering and the baked capresse is unparalled. I highly recommend this restaurant. I have brought several friends here and they have been just as impressed with the quality of food as I have been. This is an amazing find! Everyone should give it a try. They will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited the Queen Creek restaurant. Disappointed. Wife and I had sausage cheese pizza. Sausage lacks  flavor. Sauce is applied sparsely. The dough tasted like toast. Staff was freindy and courteous.  Clean and commodious eating area."}
{"text":"Ordered multiple items and everything was delicious.  Service was excellent.  My favorite was the Chicken Marsala."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times. We've not tried anything but the pizza yet, so that is what this review covers. We get an 18 inch , which is huge, and we have it the next day too!  We love getting a 'half and half' pizza , with half being the pesto chicken , and the other being Vito's three meat pizza (or something like that). Pretty different tastes, but we like to have the variety. We've had consistently good quality, both in the food and service. One time, we ordered homemade cheesecake...  so good!  They say that they made it fresh there (by Vito himself). Definitely worth the try. It has typically been busy (a good sign), although we've always been able to get a table. Glad we found this place - it's a great place to have in your restaurant 'rotation'."}
{"text":"Very friendly restaurant, fast service and the food was absolutely fantastic. Had an ice cold beer to start, pizza was totally East coast and the ricotta shells with meat sauce. Bob served, Vito prepared and I wouldn't have known that if they weren't so friendly. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional pizza- I especially enjoyed the margherita pizza.  I added garlic to it, which ended up being a good choice.  The garlic knots are great, and the desserts are homemade and really, really good.  Had the cannoli and the tiramisu.  Also, incredibly good, friendly service.  :-)"}
{"text":"Delish, delish and delish. The perfect amount of everything. Very authentic NY pizza. I have not tried anything else on the menu because the pizza is so darn good!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and breadsticks. We called the waitress mom the whole time during our visit. (Inside joke) great food and reminded me of pizza back east. Must try if you love New York pizza!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, when you're here, you're family. The hospitality here is unparalleled. When time permits, Vito, the owner, and the crew will be sure to stop by, introduce themselves and drop a friendly hello. It's so nice to come to such a wonderful Italian restaurant and have authentic cuisine. Vito definitely takes pride in his work and the staff delivers. When you come, request Desiree and tell her Mark and Cristina recommended her. Enjoy the amazing food and ambiance. Support your local Italianos and enjoy what Vito and his staff is proud to serve you! Till next time, ciao!"}
{"text":"This is our third time with Brooklyn V.  Once at the restaurant and twice for delivery.  It has been outstanding every time.  Their 3V pizza is our favorite and amazing.  Their pepperoni, cheese and chicken pesto is great as well.  All of the salads are great.  We're going to try some of their pasta dishes next as they look fantastic.  Our new favorite place."}
{"text":"These guys are legitimately cooking New York food.  After bonding over our shared history in Bay Ridge, we settled down to a pepperoni pizza, the white eggplant pizza, and stuffed shells.  Pizzas were perfectly done with crisp, tasty crust, perfect thinness, just enough grease cooked out of the cheese, fresh ricotta and a really superb sauce.  Stuffed shells are often heavy and dense, but Vito makes a really light, well seasoned filling and the shells are expertly al dente.  The only thing better than the food is the service - thanks Desiree!  Thoughtful, friendly, attentive and never overbearing.  Twice we asked them to open a place in Scottsdale, but until then its time very, very, very well spent to get to them for such great food."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian food. My family and I Moved from New York State to Arizona last year. Our hometown had a plethora of good Italian restaurants and we had difficulty finding \"authentic\" Italian food. We eventually found it here. The food is delicious. As the namesake says, the owners are from Brooklyn. They are extremely friendly and inviting, too."}
{"text":"New York style thin crust....not even close!!   They claim if it's under a 1/2 inch, that's New York style thin crust.   And it's chewy!  It should be a 1/4 inch and crispy....nice try guys, but no thanks.  The sauce is too sweet, I think they are trying to cover up the lack of knowledge on how to make a New York style thin crust."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them a few times and food has been good. Vodka sauce is my favorite. Meatballs are awesome. Must have."}
{"text":"Great little place. Went to see a friend perform live music there, and they accommodated all of us - three adults and three babies. I had the sausage and onion Stromboli, and hubby and his mom got the margherita pizza. My Stromboli was enormous, easily two meals-worth, and delicious! Hubby and MIL really enjoyed their pizza as well. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It was their two year anniversary when we got there, not knowing this information; but we got treated very well. Customer service was beyond wonderful.  Bianco pizza: one of the best pizzas I've had in awhile. The ricotta cheese definitely gives it that extra something. The thinness of it was light and crispy. Wings: we got them hot..could have had more sauce but you could actually taste the chicken, which is way better than other places considering they taste like oil and sauce. Garlic knots: soft and small pillows of goodness. Not an overwhelming amount of garlic."}
{"text":"My all time favorite pizza delivery! I have ordered from them at least 5 times and the quality of the food is outstanding. We have ordered the delicious meat pizza and just love it. I have also ordered the chicken parmisan and many of the salads. All have arrived quickly and were delicious. You might also want to get some olive knots to snack on, as they are also a yummy treat. The desserts were delicious too but on the smaller side, portion wise. You probably want to order one per person!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with Brooklyn V's, so I will be specific to what I ordered, in fairness to menu items I have not tried.  Order -  14\" Margherita pizza Antipasto salad Cannoli  Let's start with the delivery - 90 minutes at least, which may have been a fluke, but almost always means cold pizza.  :(  The salad was extremely bitter - it tasted like half of the salad was giardiniera - perhaps they made it wrong.  It was barely edible as a \"salad\" - it tasted like edible garnish.  The pizza was predictably cold, so I warmed a slice in the oven a little.  First off, the only reason I ordered the pizza was because the picture showed a solid looking Margherita - fresh mozzarella SLICES, fresh green basil, etc.  Once you have had a real Margherita, your life will forever be a littler brighter.  What I got was a 17 buck \"freezer box\" quality pizza.    The cannoli were ok, but nothing to write home about, and certainly nowhere near restaurant or deli quality cannoli, of which there are plenty around.  I feel like I wasted half a Franklin - that's never fun."}
{"text":"Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo was good but the pizza was average at best."}
{"text":"Took my wife to Warner location first time on a Friday night.  They were pretty busy, but not full.  She had chicken pesto pizza and i had 3 meat. The pizza was very good, 8/10. Crust was outstanding, meatball was tasty, but sausage was meh, lacking flavor.  People were super nice, but service was slow (took just over an hour to get a pizza). Family biz atmosphere made it more of an experience than just dinner. Will go back when they are less busy.  The Stromboli and calzone await."}
{"text":"Love this place. Love their food.As authentic to NY Italian as it gets here in Az. Very nice, cozy atmosphere with great service from our waitress Allora. We were a party of 12 last night and everyone was raving about their dishes. The cheese pizza here is superb : perfect crust, great sauce and just the right mix of cheese. Eggplant parm was the best I have had in years and their calzones are amazing. Cooked just right and everything blended well. My experience in Az with other restaurants trying to make Calzones has been so so with most just throwing the stuff in hoping it gels. The owner Vito has been doing this for 30 years and certainly brings that and more to this awesome place.  My new favorite place in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Edible but will not order again. They advertise delivery but use Slice to deliver which took an hour and the pizza was cold. Ordered Margarita which sucked, not enough cheese. The meat pizza was better but both had to be reheated in my toaster oven to eat. $50, so not worth it. I only ordered because of reviews but maybe that is for dine in only. Dont get delivery!!!"}
{"text":"Checked out this joint based on the positive reviews. Had garlic knots to start...good but nothing better than the norm.  Pizza was also good but nothing I would consider significantly better than your average pizza joint.  Tried bruschetta pizza.  Although it was good,  probably will stick to pie shops closer to our home."}
{"text":"Great place! The waiters work as team to take of their customers- kinda nice to feel like they care!  Food is good at a good price. The owner came over to make sure we were happy with everything. Recommend this place for sure, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Placed a rather simple pick up order-small pepperoni pizza.  I was not told a price on the phone, I figured it would be in the 10 dollar range.  Lesson learned, never assume anything!  When i got there, I paid over 15$, which, I'm sorry is EXCESSIVE!   They need to sprinkle gold or something on there to make it worth the money at that price.  Either way, I paid since I did order it and figured if it was a really good pizza it was worth it.  Needless to say I was further disappointed when I got home and started eating it-now, I don't have extremely high standards when it comes to pizza-I love dominos, pizza hut, you name it-but the sauce was bland and had no taste to it. I lived in Boston for many years and have visited NYC many times; believe me when I tell you, this place has nothing, and I mean NOTHING in common with NY pizza.  I was disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"This is an awesome pizza place. We ordered delivery and the strombolis are amazing and the garlic knots are to die for. Great place to order and have food quickly."}
{"text":"First time ordering.  We had a pizza (half V's 3 meat/half bianco) wings and garlic knots and everything was really good.   We will order again for sure!"}
{"text":"We found this pizza place from a good friend so we decided to dine in .  Right as we walk through the door we were greeted with smiles and it didn't stop there the food was amazing ! Pizza , wings , down to the Oreo Cheesecake ! The owner came over to our table introduced himself very nice gentleman he told us he had been making pizzas since he was 14 yrs old and it shows trust me .  If you live in the Gilbert Az area it's a must Desiree thank you for the wonderful service also"}
{"text":"I ordered an eggplant Parmesan sub and it was AMAZING! My husband ordered a pepperoni calzone and he said it was great as well.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 bc of two things. 1. When I got to the counter three different people saw me and didnt ask what I needed. Finally I think the owner asked if was helped and he told the other woman to help me.  2. When I opened up my sub , the wax paper was wrapped on top of the sub which got some of the cheese stuck to it. I Love cheese so I was upset lol  Once again this place is awesome and will be back."}
{"text":"OMG!!! The food and service her is AMAZING. Super friendly staff. Especially Desiree'!! Food is consistently delicious and the beer is very cold!! Being a Chicago guy for 40 years, it's so exciting to find a place near my home that makes a top self pizza. Also, try the Stromboli and Calzone!  Stop in on a  night when there is live entertainment and it's packed!! Wow! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Service sucks,  been here a few times and they serve there \"local Brooklyn Arizona friends\" first while we sit and wait for ever. Never going back unless I have 3 hours to wait and watch every one else eat for fun. If you have hours to kill go there. Booo"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday with my husband and son. We had the garlic knots and a special appetizer, baked caprese salad. The baked caprese salad was incredible! The balsamic vinegar was delicious, the mozzarella was chewy and the bread was crispy. Perfect combination. I had the penne pasta with chicken, broccoli, black olives, garlic and olive oil. Hubby had spaghetti and meatballs with a side of sausage. Son had V's Three Meat pizza. Everything was outstanding and we had enough leftovers for us all to eat twice more. :) We even got to enjoy live music while having dinner. We'll definitely be back again! Just remember, the rest of Gilbert loves this place, too, so it can get pretty busy."}
{"text":"Wow! Just wow!  Our neighbors have been telling us about this restaurant for awhile so we decided to check it out.   It's hidden in the corner of the plaza and it almost looks like a little pizza joint, which it's not!  We ordered pizza, wings, meatballs, and the fettuccine.   All it was amazing!  Our waitress Samantha was just the best!! She gave us a little history of the restaurant and she was so proud to be working there and to for it to be a family owned an operated restaurant.   We will be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Very Tasty. Way way better than Casa Nova Brothers!!!! Yuk. Guys Keep up the good work. I'll keep coming back if you stay consistent. A little tucked back had to drive around to find you, but pleased I didn't give up the search. If you guys are from New York bring more of that NY goodness out here. Very Very good.!!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place! We ordered for pickup through online app (which made it very easy) and was ready in exactly 20mins. Staff was friendly and place was clean. The ONLY reason I am not giving 5 stars is because of their limited specialty pizza choices. There are 8 very different specialty choices, all of which had 3 toppings or less, so if you like alot of toppings you'd pay extra per topping.  We ordered the 3 meat pizza and added olives for my toddler for extra $2 but there wasn't much olives at all considering the extra topping fee. So if you wanted a typical \"supreme\" style pizza with meats and veggies, you'd pay close to $20-25 which is a lot for a 14in pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I couldn't stop eating! I was so full yet it was just so good. Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We are pretty faithful to our regular pizza place but I am so glad we tried this place. My husband and I ordered the stuffed shells and a pepperoni pizza to share. The stuffed shells were definitely some of the best I've ever had! Everything about the food was good. We ordered over Yelp and picked it up with no problems. Definitely will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Man the food here is soooo good.  I am in love with their Stromboli and think the sausage and pepper is supreme.  The layout is a little cluttered on the inside but when the weather warms up a bit they have a nice outside section.   The staff is friendly and nice to see owners in the operation.  The pizza is best ordered by the slide as you will get that perfect crispiness vs. the standard flabby droop you find in most places.   They nail their marinara sauce with just the right balance of acidity and sweetness.  The cheese they use is top notch and produces little oil when heated.  Great flavor too!  We will certainly be back and between this place and Gilbert Pizza I really do not feel the need to venture out further in this area."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Brooklyn V's.  We had the garlic knots, sausage, meatball, and pepperoni stromboli, and sausage and peppers hero.  The stromboli was amazing!  Other reviews have shown that is was more bread and small amount of meat, which was not the case!  We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"This is a local mom & pop that you could easily mistake for a chain restaurant once you go inside. For now, its the one and only.:)  It strikes an expertly crafted balance between the look of a fine dining establishment and a lounge, all while providing the comfort and ease of a fast casual restaurant. There are nice marble counters at the bar, where you can relax and order a beer or a glass of wine, and an outdoor patio with comfortable seating you could easily spend hours in. What's more, is that there is often live music on Saturdays, which is another plus, and their events makes it a great place for families, couples, and friends hanging out. In my opinion, you get more than what you pay for. They use authentic Sicilian recipes and make a mind blowing Antipasto salad. This is because of how particular they are here about the quality of their ingredients. Everyone that I have taken here has really enjoyed their food. I'm pretty sure you will too."}
{"text":"Portabella Ravioli is my newest addiction! Delicous with the creamy mushroom sauce! Meatsauce for my dad is as delicious as the meatballs. We love this place! Delivery took  a bit tonite but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Everything we had was delicious , the Strombolis the antipasto salad , the pizza the cheesecake were  delicious... Came back 6 days later with my big dog Ed and he was impressed .. Desire was the nicest waitress and  she was on point with her recommendations ... Love seeing the owners in the kitchen"}
{"text":"My husband and I were searching for a really good, New York style Italian restaurant, like the ones we had back home when we lived in NY. We came across Brooklyn V's Lindsay and Warner location, on Yelp, and decided to give it a try because of the great reviews and because it's only 5 minutes from our house. What a wonderful experience we had! From the delicious thin crust pizza and creamy penne ala vodka to the awesome cannolis and tiramisu, Brooklyn V's has become one of our favorite frequented spots. The owner, a Native New Yorker, is very hospitable and the wait staff is friendly and helpful. Every time we go there we feel like we're home. We love Brooklyn V's and can't recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"I am from ny and i have to say this place has the best pizza and calzones I havent had anything elst tho"}
{"text":"The service here is phenomenal. The entire staff makes you feel like you're a part of their family. I recommend you make your way here. I've been 5 times in the last 2 weeks.  thank you for providing the best service in the Gilbert area. Furthermore the Pizza is AMAZING!!! You can't find pizza this good unless you're in Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow. I like how family is involved. My pasta noodles were under cooked but it was still good."}
{"text":"I should be dumbfounded by the rave reviews of this place given the quality of pizza, but there are other very average pizza places in Gilbert that have also garnered 4.5 star ratings.   I suggested Brooklyn V's last Friday when I was watching a movie with my parents. No one felt like driving so our usual go to, Grimaldi's, wasn't going to happen. I checked on Yelp and saw that I could get delivery from a place that I bookmarked over a year ago. Perfect timing!  Unfortunately, the pizza was a big let down. We got the margherita ($29 with tip and tax), and it was so unmemorable. The crust was really bad. Usually, I love crust, but with this one, I was wishing my dogs were around so I give them their \"pizza bones.\" I didn't like the grape tomatoes either. Cheese and sauce were fine. Again, just very average. My dad crisped up my 2nd piece in a frying pan, and that seemed to help.   Lesson learned. Don't be lazy. Drive to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Pizza was fine. Televisions in the place had on Fox News. Why? I don't want to watch this junk. I should have asked if they would turn the channel. Brooklyn V's please turn off Fox News."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy so yummy I love this place. Being from New York, I'm a total pizza snob. I just happened on this place when I was getting my nails done one day and it blew my mind. Reminds me of home. I want to try other menu items but the pizza is just too good to not eat."}
{"text":"We definitely will be back! This place was absolutely amazing... the food was beyond delicious. My husband and I split the 14' pizza half buffalo chicken half bruschetta. It was the perfect amount of food for us and the tastes were amazing, we didn't need anything else. The kids shared the chicken Alfredo dinner  which was plenty and recommended for children to split. The garlic nots are a must! The service was exceptional and everyone was so friendly.   See you again soon!!"}
{"text":"All I can can say is wow! This is my first time ordering from here and I ordered via grubhub and after reading reviews on yelp I thought my food would be ridiculously late. Turns out it was 20 minutes early! I ordered the stuffed shells, caprese salad and 2 meatballs. It came with 4 stuffed shells which in and of itself a hearty meal. The caprese salad was not terrible but would have liked to seen riper tomatoes and a tad more salt. The meatballs tasted like they had worshester sauce which is totally not necessary but the sauce they were in was yummy. Back to the shells, everything about it was great! My food arrived piping hot and early! Also their mix of Dr Pepper was on point tonight! I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"You know, I like their food, but they always get our order wrong. It's been SEVERAL times. No apologies when you call and tell them. With all the new business in Gilbert we tried to give them another chance, but perhaps Pomo and Oregano's will be our go-to places."}
{"text":"Pizza was average for New York style. Delivery was pretty quick but the pizza was cold and way over-priced. 25 dollars for one pizza is a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ from CA. Hands down the BEST Italian food I've had in a loooooong time! We can't get enough of it!!  My husband is from NY and he approves/agrees this place is the real deal. We've tried the pizza (just like NY), garlic knots, chicken marsala, chicken fettuccine alfredo, stromboli, chicken francaise, lasagna, mozz sticks and almost all the desserts! The sauces, the dough.....everything we've eaten were DELICIOUS! The staff are all super friendly! You know it's a good spot when the owner is walking around introducing himself to his guests! Can't wait to try more dishes and work my way through the rest of their menu:D"}
{"text":"To sum it up: This is one of the best Pizzas you will find west of the Hudson river... actually it is better than a lot of pizza in Manhattan.   I came here and was pleasantly surprised that NY pizza does exist in AZ!    The Pizza:  Crust was well balanced and had the classic NY flavor and chewy yet crispy you only find in NY.  The toppings were phenomenal, the eggplant was perfectly breaded and seasoned, sauce, cheese all extremely well done.  Wings: I asked for the wings extra crispy and they knocked it out! Wing sauce was on point and the wings were crispy yet very tender and juicy.  They are clearly experts here as well  I am blown away by Brooklyn V's and will now definitely be a regular.  They have incredible quality and attention to detail that is getting harder and harder to find."}
{"text":"Just another pizza claiming to be New York's finest.  Ordered the 3v's pizza and if you closed your eyes it was meat and cheese. Zero flavor to have pepperoni, sausage and meatball all taste the same. Sure it had cheese and sauce, but no flavor. Very disappointing, why do restaurants cut corners by not using herbs and spices.  Really too bad, just average."}
{"text":"May give it another shot for lunch, but will not be getting delivery again. Ordered through Grubhub, and it took almost 2 hours to arrive. Pizza was cold and tasted like Grocery store pizza. Meatballs were good. Wings were meh."}
{"text":"Awesome NY authentic Italian Food! You must try this place!  If you love Italian food and/or long for a taste of the NY style Italian Food, this is the place for you.  I am from NY and have been waiting for some good Italian Food in the Phoenix Metro area and this family restaurant has it all!  The Pizza is so tasty and you can fold it just like a New Yorker!  From Garlic Knots,  to Caprese, to Baked Ziti, to Pesto and Alfredo, to Chicken Marsala this place has all the traditional Italian dishes.  Meatballs are delish! You can't skip desert either, the cannoli and Zepolli are superb!  Super friendly service.  All around a great experience, A+++  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We just tried out the new location in Queen Creek and we were so happy we did!  The food was delicious and they offered a wide variety to choose from.  I went to New York some years back and was craving some authentic pasta, this restaurant has come the closest I have EVER found here in Arizona!  The service was exceptional.  Anna made sure we had a table for our large party.  The servers and additional staff made sure to double check that we had everything we needed.  This will be our new place to come for date nights,  special occasions or just because!"}
{"text":"Best pizza and garlic knots in the Phoenix region, hands down.   I can't stand when everyone claims \"New York Style Pizza\" and ends up being nowhere even close. I'm a New Yorker and moved out here four years ago. I have traveled throughout all 48 of the continental United States multiple times and always find it humorous and disappointing when a place makes claims with their fake NY Style sign. A friend recommended Brooklyn V's because his Long Island wife says it's the only place she will eat pizza here in Phoenix. I took him up on the suggestion and am so glad I did. The second the garlic knots came out I knew. I then had my plain cheese slice come out and it has the perfect thin crust slight crisp yet still foldable feel to it. He uses much better mozzarella cheese than anyone else and knows how to manipulate the water to get it like The City water (come on, there is only one city you can call The City - NYC). Finally, my stuffed shells came out. They were fantastic. And, my waiter did what no other waiter has done outside of the northeast (and because of this I knew I was at a true NY owned Italian/pizza joint). He asked if I wanted a loaf to go with my stuffed shells. Yeah, most places throw some bread on the table (what Italian place wouldn't), but a true Italian place has a good crispy outside soft inside Italian slices loaf coming and coming until the check is paid. And, sometimes even more after that. The owner came out when he heard I was from NY to check on my wife and I and see what we thought. We ended up having a conversation for 15-20 minutes. Great guy who knows his pizza. It was nice talking about NY with him.   Plain and simple, you want the best pizza and garlic knots in Phoenix metro and some damn good Italian food? Take the trip to Brooklyn V's. We go there from Ahwatukee, which is a haul, but totally worth it. Again and again, our pizza spot. It should be yours, too."}
{"text":"Wait staff was really nice and tried hard. Our first and only visit we waited an hour and a half.  The oven was down.  Perhaps another day may be better. Like I said the staff works very hard."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from here 3 different times - three different types of pizza. Each time the center was soggy, even on a basic pepperoni one topping. The only thing we consistently liked was the garlic knots. Really wanted to like this place but not for us."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and it took over an hour. Pizza was cold and did not taste good at all. I found that the garlic knots and stuffed shells lacked flavor as well. Needless to say, the Food was to be desired. Will not ever order again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The first time we went to the restaurant many months ago,  we sat at the bar that overlooks the kitchen.    The service was great and we were made to feel very welcome.   We unfortunately watched an order for take out fall on the floor.   Imagine how mortified I was when they packed it up and gave it to the customer who did not see what happened.  We made sure that didn't happen to our order.  We decided to try them again over the weekend.   We walked in and there were 3 tables occupied.   We were not treated with kindness.   The waiter came over got our drink order and asked if we wanted a appetizer.  We ordered some Zuchini sticks which came in a timely manner.   The waiter never came back to take our order.   After waiting for 40 minutes, he finally showed up.  We expressed our unhappiness with the delay and were told that he was tied up with online orders and had to deal with a mix up in the kitchen.   We decided to leave since we obvisiously we were not a priority.     The table next to us had their own waitress for 6 people.   Maybe because the kids had Brooklyn V t-shirts on.     The waiter never got a manager.  He showed no emotion how about how we were treated.  He offered to comp our bill which we refused and paid it.  I guess if you order online or are regulars/family you will get some service but beware that your order online may have hit the floor or worse prior to you picking it up."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to try this place, being that it's local and they have a doo-wap group performing...at least this Saturday.  We had brushetta and garlic knots for the table.  The brushetta had plenty of fresh tomatoes and basil, among other things.  The garlic knots had minced garlic butter...more flavorful than garlic butter with powder.  The margherita pizza was very flavorful...it had chopped tomatoes and a crust crispy and NY-style...thinner, but not too thin.  And the musical group was really fun, but does not allow for good conversation if you're sitting nearby.  The waitstaff was good natured and stopped by enough to check up on us, refill drinks, despite being a busy night.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Margherita pizza. Great crust, crunchy yet chewy. Sauce has a nice sweetness to it. They also do a frequent flyer type program as well."}
{"text":"Tried this place the other night and was blown away!  Real NY pizza thin crust pizza and the meat Stromboli was amazing.  They have many house-made desserts, fresh salads and pasta dishes.  Friendly and great service!  This is our new go to place!  Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check out Brooklyn V's for some time now, but usually hit up other pizza joints instead . Well, that just changed. Some of the best pizza, not just in Gilbert, but in the Valley. Authentic N.Y. pizza. Not to much tomato sauce, fresh cheese, good meats and when you pick up a slice, it doesn't wilt. The dough is light and airy, with a great crust. We also tried the chicken wings and garlic knots,both very good. The wings were large and meaty and the knots were fresh and hot,with just the right amount of garlic and butter. The service was excellent, very attentive, and friendly, even the owner came over and asked about our lunch....now that's good P.R. They just found a new customer in the Barber family and we will tell others about Brooklyn V's pizza."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was amazing, Portabella ravioli amazing!!!!! Stuffed shells so cheesy!!! Great job guys!!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place and it will be the last.  It took 1 hour 7 min to get my pizza and cheese sticks delivered. Now the delivery time was long but would not be a reason for  a one star rating. The pizza and cheese sticks were delivered cold.  The cheese sticks cheese was solid type cold now imagine the pizza.  So the food was thrown away as it was nasty.   What restaurant would actually allow food to be delivered this way?  Well this one did!  The temp of the pizza was 73 with a food thermometer, the cheese sticks were 69 degrees. Not only does this increase the possibility of food poisoning it's just plan bad service. On top of this they offered a credit back to my card of 19.00 from a 36.00 bill. They want to charge me 17.00 for food that was thrown away? Now included in this 17.00 is a 5.00 delivery fee and the drivers tip.  You have to add the tip when you order thru them as they use slice for there on line orders. So now I have to file a dispute with the cc company.  My option is stay away, cold dangerous food is delivered I would not risk it. I will also be filing a complaint with the health department on Monday as it is really dangerous delivering cold food like it was tonight."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm a pizza snob.....been eating it for over 25 years now......thought I would try something new.....I have my five or so great places.......I get a pie once if not twice a week.....read some reviews on yelp, thought I would give this place a try.....made the mistake of not going to their website.....ordered off of yelp.....35 bones for a pizza and 6 wings and a couple of knots........so not worth it.....wings were dry.....the sausage on pizza looked liked chopped up hot dogs.....I'm not one to complain on food....but when I'm dropping almost 40 bills on a pizza and six wings I better have a great experience.....I'd take a little ceaser hot and ready any day over this.....I try and support local mom and pop shops....but when a pizza costs almost half a C note.....your not reaching out to your mom and pop customers"}
{"text":"We will always try something new and local. This place was ok. I think I expected way more because I recently took my first trip to the east coast and spent 6 days in NYC. We literally ate numerous times a day while we were there. Ok so at Brooklyn V's I had the anti pasto salad. It's definitely enough for two. Way too much mozzarella and not enough salami for my taste. The dressing was on point. Hubby had pizza really nothing special at all. I actually prefer Grimaldi's. Atmosphere non existent. I think this place is for the younger crowd just out of high school. I really do hope this place succeeds."}
{"text":"There is no denying that the pizza and garlic knots here are good.  I ordered the eggplant pizza which features crispy fried eggplant on a white pizza.  I liked the eggplant, but ended up enjoying the base white pizza without the eggplant even more.  The garlic knots are likely the top ones in Gilbert.  The salad was a disaster filled with low cost ingredients and the pasta was average at best.  The prices were also too high in comparison with the local competition."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place and so happy I did! The pizza was delicious! The atmosphere was family friendly and the place was very clean. I look forward to trying more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Went to Brooklyn V's for lunch on a Sunday. Staff was friendly and courteous. We were greeted very quickly and they let us sit wherever we wanted. Allowed my boyfriend to use some coupons he had for a free slice of cheese pizza with a purchase of any other slice. They even let us use two! So we both received a free cheese slice. Food was delicious. We shared an order of 12 mild wings. The wings were meaty, crunchy, and the traditional buffalo sauce had a great flavor. Ranch served with the wings was also tasty. I would highly recommend the Bbq chicken pizza. There slices of pizza were fairly large and the crust was nom noms!"}
{"text":"Yep we indeed came back for dinner. We had the v's 3 meat pizza. Best pizza I have ever had!!! Still wonderful service. Still relaxing and calming atmosphere. Definitely my favorite restaurant hands down!"}
{"text":"Their fettuccine Alfredo is amazing. The pizza is awesome too. Just bummed they switch to door dash but we will just pick up."}
{"text":"We just moved to AZ this week and were looking for a good Italian restaurant. The reviews and related pictures directed us to Brooklyn V's. We had a glass of Chianti at the bar and ordered some food to go. I have to compliment them greatly on the overall experience. They were warm, welcoming, supportive (we don't have our plates or silverware here yet), and just overall NICE. This is a small, cute and very comfortable place. We will definitely be back to sit, have a glass of wine, eat and relax. The food: pizza - crispy crust (more like NY style), quality ingredients, great cheese (!!!), Stromboli - cheese with added Italian sausage, this will change your whole opinion on Stromboli, the crust is great, but the ratio of crust to ingredients is the star (frequently you get too much crust), penne with Vodka sauce - as it should be, a very delicate pink sauce with the penne having the right about of bite. When you move across the country, and you find a place that understands customer relationships are the heart of any good restaurant and, it has great food, you immediately put them in your foodie arsenal. They did not know us! Vito, Anna, thank you for such a great experience during a time we are a little stressed. Our moving van arrives tomorrow, and we look forward to making Brooklyn V's a regular stop in our new life. Thank you."}
{"text":"There have been a few pizza places in this suite over the years, I tried them all but never went back after trying them out once or twice (and I live pretty much right across the street).   Love the food here, owners and servers are very nice and bend over backwards to give you what you want. I've brought friends here and they've enjoyed the food and atmosphere as well!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. Love the atmosphere, the staff is so welcoming and fun, the food, oh my gosh the food was made by the Nonna Of my dreams. I am still at the booth, recovering from the full stomach that. Ow impedes me from standing up. We will be coming here often for sure!"}
{"text":"We ate outside. Very nice and clean!   We had bruschetta bread for an appetizer. They served us about 9 slices of very good bruschetta. A LOT for an appetizer!   The pizza was DELICIOUS! We asked for extra cheese and mushrooms for toppings. They did put a really great amount of cheese, and REAL big fresh mushrooms MMMMM!   We had a plate of cannolis for dessert. They were the short more thin type of cannolis vs the long thick type. They serve 3 on a plate decorated with powdered sugar. They were very good! I never had a cannoli before, it was a good first experience. :D  The waiter was so sweet, kind and attentive, and we had leftovers to take home!   WILL go back and WILL recommend! There were SO many things that I plan to go back and try. Stuffed shells too. Oh my goodness... That menu... ^v^"}
{"text":"I looooove this place. Food is always delicious, service is great, and always very quick/reliable with delivery. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Let me start off saying the pizza here is great.... however customer service is HORRIBLE!!! Came in and wasn't greeted had to walk up to the counter stood in FRONT of a server who still didn't greet us, finally he said I gotta finish a couple tickets first... take a seat. We ordered 2 slices of pizza mozzarella sticks with ranch and a salad. Waited 20min for the sticks but got no ranch, 30 min for our SLICE of pizza he came over and forgot about our salad. He was to focused on the fact his family was there to worry about us or other tables. Didn't check on our meal so I had to walk up to the counter and wait to get ranch. Servers name was Jared. Won't be coming back here. Also was served my pizza on a paper plate... when I'm dining in I want real plates."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza lover and have been fortunate through business travel to have tried some of the best pizza from coast to coast, according to ratings, etc.  My wife has ordered their pizza before and had it delivered, so I knew it was excellent, but this trip I wanted to visit the establishment, even if it was for carry out.  I had a chance to enjoy a beverage and watch the operation while I waited for my order. What stood out was attentive and friendly service, a nice clean atmosphere, and the pizza makers going about their business in a serious manner.  You can tell that only quality ingredients are used and the taste is phenomenal, along with the right texture on the crust, which you only get from having a proper oven.  The pizza this time was again excellent, and I got a side of pizza sauce for dipping, which is top notch and flavorful, but I thought the friendly staff and the great service around me set them apart. Hope to convince my crew to dine in next time."}
{"text":"Highly recommend. It's always great food and friendly service. We feel welcome and go too often. It's addicting."}
{"text":"Let me say first off....the owners are very nice and the pizza can be great. They offer reward points which is nice. However, I've been there more often than not and had problem after problem, plus the wait can be long when dining in. I've waited over an hour for one large pizza, only for the young waiter boy to tell me my pizza was burnt and would have to make a new one. Then Ive had the experience of under cooked mozeralla sticks. Wrong check delivered to my table. Given my phone number for the waiter to tell me he forgot to ring up my order for the points and it was too late. Yes, I was offered a discount on my next order, but that's not the point.  THEN, two weeks ago, we went in at lunch time and was told they had no cook, couldnt order anything and to come back later. AGAIN, although as nice as they are...this is no way to run a business.  UPDATED REVIEW--they have improved over the years. Changed to four stars."}
{"text":"Can't seem to fine really good pizza in Gilbert. 2nd time delivery pushing $50. The best part of the food, pizza, Stromboli etc is the bread. Our delivery guy is super nice and very courteous and polite. The salad was too cheap for $8. Felt like it came out of a bag and left me expecting way more for the total  price.  Will keep looking around."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing pizza! Made me a fan of thin crust! Can't believe the flavor!!! I'm reaching for another slice!"}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped  in yesterday,  on the humble not knowing what to expect. Food was awesome they made us some special pasta just for us to try yum yum yum. Brooklyn V's service was excellent the best service we have had since arriving in Phoenix & Desiree is the Bomb.com she was our server and she hung out with us while we were there it was just like hanging  with out of your cousins or close friends.  Definitely going back.  PS. The wings were A1"}
{"text":"We were referred to Brooklyn V's by a stranger and we were not disappointed! The service and food were great! Vito treated us like we were old friends. This will definitely be part of our restaurant rotation from here on out!"}
{"text":"We have been here a few times to pick up but we typically order delivery. We love the food but the customer service sucks. When ever I order for pick up I always have an issue."}
{"text":"Awesome little place. Awesome pizza and wings. Service was great. We'll be back often."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian food in Phoenix!  This is the first good non-chain Italian restaurant we have been to since moving to Gilbert in July.  Very good pizza and calzones.  Cant wait to go back and try the pasta!"}
{"text":"Best marguerite pizza I've had.  Not convenient to where we live but we stop by when in the neighborhood and sometimes will go out of our way to stop by.  Garlic knots are pretty darn yummy too.  Service with a smile and then some.  Great neighborhood pizza place with good food made by good people."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I ordered the eggplant parmesan with salad and spaghetti. The blue cheese dressing was kind of slimy, so I sent it back and got ranch dressing instead, which was good. The eggplant coating was overcooked, and the eggplant inside was super thin but still hard. The spaghetti was watery, so the extra liquid softened the overcooked eggplant coating. Now for the service- aside from the fact that he never once smiled at us, our server kept running his hands through his hair- a major turnoff because I was afraid some of that hair would wind up in my food. I had to ask another server to bring me a drink refill because our server was not very attentive. When I asked for a box for my leftovers I could see him behind the counter once again running his hands through his hair and texting on his phone, all the while enjoying a drink at the same time. Food was poor and service was even worse. I will not be returning to Brooklyn V's."}
{"text":"My husband's grandparents grew up in Italy; when they first got to Cleveland they supported themselves by making and selling \"macaroni\" in Little Italy. So yes, we are picky about Italian food. And we love this place. The sauce (and the crust) make the pizza like enormous slices of heaven. The garlic knots, spaghetti with meat sauce, everything. Everything. We love everything we've ever eaten here. The service isn't super fast and efficient, but the servers have a great attitude and they're warm and friendly. You can tell by the hundreds of pictures on the walls that it's a true family/neighborhood restaurant. My kids love to look at the pics and see all the people they recognize."}
{"text":"Wow! I popped in for lunch on a Tuesday and was kindly greeted by Bob, one of the owners. I sat down for lunch and thought I'd give their pizza and Stromboli a try.  The pizza was good. I'm from NJ, and I was very impressed. It's on par with some of the other NY style pizza places in Gilbert. The Stromboli, though... Out of this world. I saw how big it was and I figured I'd get through half after a slice of pizza, but I couldn't leave any of it. The dough was flavorful, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. There was a ton of cheese! One of the best I ever had and it's made from scratch, so it takes about 20min of you just walk in. Absolutely worth it!  Thanks Bob for a great experience! I know where I'm going for my pizza fix from now on!"}
{"text":"Really liked this place good pizza and it's slightly nicer than a lot of other pizza places in the area. Will be back to try some of the non pizza options."}
{"text":"Omg!!! I've been looking for an awesome pizza shop that truly brought me back home to Brooklyn and let me tell you they were on the money on quality n taste thank you Brooklyn pizza for really standing by your name..your the best pizza in Gilbert!!! And to top it off the cannoli's are beyond perfect!!!! Your service fantastic xoxoxo"}
{"text":"We've been here many times and have always enjoyed our food and the service is always great.  Only in one occasion they made us wait even though there were a few empty tables but later realized that the area had been reserved for a large party.  It would be good if they had told us but we totally understood.  Food is above average and prices are very reasonable so worth waiting if we need to!  I usually recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"Been to Brooklyn V's several times since they've open, my complaint isn't the food...  Last night my husband tried to order a pizza for take out. It was 845, they close at 9. The young female on the phone stated that they didn't want to make our pizza since they were closing... Wow. Great customer service. We normally aren't those ppl that order for right before close, but we are moving away from the area and that would have been our last time there. Thanks for the great memory."}
{"text":"This is one of those times that I was led astray by the reviews.  Ordered two pizzas for take out - an 18 inch cheese and an 18 inch three meat.  Asked upon ordering for them to be double cut.  Had to explain to the employee on the phone what that was and then be put on hold to check!?  Brought these pizzas to a potluck so by the time we ate it was cold.  I was not impressed.  It was edible but that is about it.  Another person brought Barros pizza to the potluck.  The Barros pizza was gone almost in an instant while my pizzas sat and got picked at.  Brought an entire pizza home with me.  Our family has eaten it reheated and cold and it is just okay.  Not gross but not that good.  I paid almost $37 for these mediocre pizzas.  I can't imagine ever trying this place again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and he service was great.  Anna took care of us and Vito came out from the kitchen to make sure the food was great.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a strange location, way in the back corner of a V-shaped strip mall, so you might now see it.  But look for it!  We had the eggplant pizza, and it was scrumptious!  The crust was thin, NY-style, crispy on the bottom but still soft.  The eggplant was fried to perfection and not greasy, and the sauce is the best!  Really, go now!"}
{"text":"Being Italian and from NYC, I was skeptical about this place, but the pizza reminded me of home. I also ordered an eggplant stromboli and an order of lasagna, both were extremely good. I am so glad someone told me about this place, I look forward to trying more menu items my next visit. I met the owner, Vito, who was extremely personable as well as his staff."}
{"text":"I can't wait to try the pizza!  I found some menus for Brooklyn V's that had been delivered to my shop. After seeing their great Yelp reviews I HAD to try it for myself.  I ordered the sausage and pepper hero, the bruschetta, and the garlic knots. Here's what I think: *Bruschetta- It's 7 pieces of loveliness. The bread itself it very good and the toppings are of exceptional quality. The balsamic glaze really stole my heart. Tomatoes were ripe, onions fresh, and basil bright...winner any day.  *Garlic knots- great value. 12 pieces for $3 and change! The texture and butteriness of the dough was perfect. My only critique on these would be that I'd like more garlic flavor. That will not keep me from getting these every time I eat here, however.  *Sausage and pepper hero- absolutely terrific flavors! The sausage is thin cut and cooked with red peppers and onion so it ends up nice and juicy. Those juices and the olive oil blend making this really nice sauce. I wish the bread (although tasty) was a bit more stout. By the time my order was delivered it was quite soggy. Next time I order delivery I'll definitely go with pizza or pasta. But If I ever dine in this is gonna be at the top of my list.   This restaurant is not what I would call inexpensive. For the three items I ordered I paid $25 before the gratuity. I definitely feel like I got my money's worth though. I had to share the bruschetta with a coworker so it wouldn't go weird, and I'm going home with a bunch of garlic knots and half of a sandwich.  I would have given 5 stars but I wish they would use a heavier bread for such a wet Hero. If I could give 4.5 stars I would have, no problem."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something and you would be wise to listen!! Since I moved to AZ I have searched for real good back east Italian food that did not require me to drive and sit down at a table. Brooklyn V's is a Blessing, I love there eggplant, and pizza and OMG! The cannoli is straight off the boat. Plus I can order online and it gets to my house in less than 20 mins and hot.   Thank you for being you!  Reco"}
{"text":"Great food, staff and atmosphere! We had our local lunch club here and it was great! I would recommend everyone to try the ziti as well as the pizza!"}
{"text":"Brooklyn V's is a gem! They have the most delicious pizza and their crust is flavorful with just the right amount of crunch to it! My favorite is the V's three meat, spaghetti with meatballs, zucchini sticks or the Stromboli! Honestly anything you try is going to be delicious! The staff is friendly and makes you feel like part of the family, Brandon and Kerry always provide top notch service! This has become our weekly date night spot and we look forward to evenings at Brooklyn V's every week! Oh don't even think about leaving without a slice of tiramisu, we literally fight over every bite!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten their food three times. Two times I've eaten there and once had a pizza delivered. What was funny is the guy taking my pizza order told me the price and stopped talking. I was waiting for him to ask me my cc info. I think he thought I was balking at the price because he told me, \"You realize our pizzas are not the $5 kind?\" I laughed and said I don't eat $5 pizzas!  He got a kick out of that and the pie was delivered warm and tasty! I was a bachelor that weekend and the large lasted me both Saturday and Sunday. Nothing like pizza for breakfast baby!  Both times I visited there the food was really good. The first time I had the chicken Marsala and loved it. The second time I had the lasagne with meat sauce and my wife had the chicken cacciatore. She ate everything on her plate and loved it. I got full on half of the lasagne and had the other half for lunch the next day. Both times the lasagne was delicious.   We live close by so we'll be going back again for sure.   My wife and I aren't really into hearing cover music when we eat, we like to talk. The only thing I haven't appreciated about the place was the Elvis impersonator singing when we went on a Saturday night. Good singer but everything he sang was in the Elvis style...George Straight in an Elvis style...not for me thank you. Of course I did tip the gentleman because he has talent. We are looking forward to the weather cooling so we can sit either inside or out, where ever the singer is not."}
{"text":"We have a new favorite Italian restaurant and it's Brooklyn V's! We dined there on a busy Friday night and were seated right away. We started our dining experience with the caprese appetizer, which was really good! We ordered a glass of wine and relaxed, listening to the live music who was an amazing singer/songwriter and guitar player, Aaron Howard and Sarah Price, who also has an amazing voice. Anyway, after a short wait, our dinners arrived. My husband had the eggplant parmesan and I had the special, cheese tortellini with alfredo sauce, with peppers and mushrooms. We really enjoyed each of our dinners, especially the eggplant parmesan, or as my husband says, \"The best eggplant parm that he has had here in Arizona!\"   Also, the owner, Desiree was our hostess and server for the evening. She went above and beyond in regards to her service and attention to us. She treated us like her personal VIPs and I was blown away by her generosity.    We will be back again, for more music, fun, and excellent food. Thank you, Brooklyn Vs!"}
{"text":"huge fan of this place! ordered it for this first time this weekend would 100% order again. we got the buffalo chicken pizza and let me tell you- this was the first time the pizza tasted like real buffalo chicken. the sauce on the chicken was perfect and the whole thing was just delicious. also- the delivery time was excellent. yelp said our order would come in 45-60 mins- we got the order in 40, AND they didn't forget our ranch like most places do!"}
{"text":"Love the name & philosophy!  Staff very friendly and on top of their game, place was busy and they were all very efficient!! Decor And ambiance is great, love all the old photos on the walls!! The pizza has the nice bubbles and the sauce is great! Unfortunately, the crust does not live up to the crunchy yet soft n chewy n greasy ny style :(. It's no more than a Betty Crocker mix off the shelf in a local supermarket... very bland and dry.  Sorry Brooklyn V, everything Else is perfect tho!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been three times, once for pizza, then penne in vodka sauce, and most recently spaghetti with meat sauce. Absolutely everything is made fresh and I can taste every bit of it! The sauces are fantastic. Next time I'm trying the pesto. I don't even like pesto, but that's how much I enjoy the food here. The service is great too. Very friendly and warm staff. Feels like home."}
{"text":"For starters the pizza is great but even better than that is the lost art of customer service. As i sit here the place is busting at the seams with customers but the staff is doing something called hustling to keep up. If you want good pizza and to see the lost art of customer service this might be your place."}
{"text":"Ordered a lg pizza, dozen garlic knots and an eggplant parmigiana hero. Pizza is great as always, love the garlic knots, but the hero disappointed my husband because he felt it was too small for the price and the size box it came in. I will definitely keep buying from them!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE to dine with Brooklyn V's Pizza!  This is 100% authentic Brooklyn, New York-style pizza. Vince delivers the food I remember from my Brooklyn childhood. Our favorite is a BRUSCHETTA PIZZA, loaded with finely diced tomatoes, basil and high quality mozzarella atop the perfectly seasoned marinara.   If it's a meal you are looking for, the chicken parmigiana and eggplant rollatini are perfectly seasoned and baked to perfection. The portions are generous (we always have left-overs) and the desserts are delish! I consider myself a tiramisu connoisseur and theirs is perfection. Again, left-overs!  We have dined in and ordered our food delivered. The food is hot upon arrival and well packaged.  We cannot say enough good things about this delightful neighborhood gem! The wait staff is friendly and works hard to provide a great dining experience. Vince and his lovely wife are there, actively involved in their business, overseeing the food prep and service, working to give their diners a great plate of quality Italian food!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service over the phone...they do not value you as a customer at all. I called in a order over the phone and when it was delivered there were multiple things wrong with my food. Im not one to complain but when i called to inform them pf their mistake they informed me i would be compensated with a order of wings. Months later i called into make another order and use the credit which was owed to me and the person on the phone laughed at me saying that after a 2 weeks period they \"throw away their list.\" I then asked if she was going to take care of me and she chuckled and said \"like i said, i talked to the owner and they said you waited past our 2 week period.\" I will never go to this place again and will make sure that it is never recommended through me as i personally run a large store myself. Basic customer care and empathy is all i ask for since i personally did nothing wrong. Thanks"}
{"text":"I was at the place from day one. Excellent service, great Chicken Marsala.  Vito and family have arrived!  Love the new closed in room, the old patio. GO Vito go!"}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service. We are from NY and really are thrilled to have amazing pizza and cannoli in Gilbert! Will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great food!! Fast delivery!  Probably the best Italian food we've had since we moved here. Garlic knots top notch--chicken Marsala excellent! Shells out of this world!"}
{"text":"Really good would defiantly return. Got the chicken Marsala and antipasto salad really good. Great service"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. I had never had new York style pizza before but I am definitely blown away this place is so good!"}
{"text":"This hidden little gem is sure to make your tummy happy . Customer service wasn't that great that night but I'm going to say they seemed short staffed ."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The pizza is the best and honestly I haven't found any restaurant in gilbert that has food as good as Brooklyns! The owner is always there and he is so kind. He makes sure that you have a great experience and that you leave happy! I'm telling you that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Great atmosphere and the prices weren't bad either! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza tonight and it took over an hour and a half to arrive, and was of course cold when it arrived.  We were starving, and so disappointed.  I called to ask what took the delivery so long and the girl who answered the phone blamed it on the online ordering system.  That is no excuse."}
{"text":"When's the last time you encountered a wine list in a pizza joint? These guys love what they do and do it very well. Seriously fresh ingredients in their menu are prepared and served by a dedicated, friendly staff that  know how to do good food. A family friendly atmosphere that is a pleasant step away from the typical chain store pizza place we so often settle for.  Great food, good price , convenient location. My new favorite pizza restaurant in Arizona."}
{"text":"I am astounded at the quality of this \"hole in the wall\" find.  Between a smoke shop and a cleaners, Brooklyn V's has blown me away.  Pizza shop?  No, this is a Brooklyn restaurant in the heart of Mesa, AZ.  I had spaghetti in clam sauce.  Where do I begin?  The pasta was al dente.  That's the first step to proving you care a bit about your food.  Next is tender clams, a TON of them, in a perfect sauce, mild with a hint of wine and garlic, sprinkled with parm and served with crusty Italian bread, baked locally and only sold to a choice few restaurants.  It absorbs the sauce perfectly, melting in the buttery, garlicky goodness.  There are only a few beers on tap.  I had the Shock Rock Belgian White, a perfect compliment to the light sauce and simple meal.  I was sent here by a local, the guy at Stamps Automotive, while they work on my car.  I cannot thank him enough."}
{"text":"Finally found a NY/NJ style pizza joint here in Az. This place is the real deal. Stopped in for lunch today. Shared an antipasto and 14\" pie with my wife. Both dishes were delicious. The antipasto had tons of ingredients with were all very fresh and flavorful. For the pie, we went half eggplant and half pesto chicken. Our server, Anna, was extremely friendly and helpful. Being from NJ as a child we struck up conversation quite easily. For dessert we each had a mini cannoli, to die for. We shall return and refer our east coast friends as well."}
{"text":"We all have our particular likes and dislikes when it comes to pizza.  My review today for Brooklyn D's does not involve their other foods,  The restaurant is clean and attractive with friendly, attentive and efficient help!  Unfortunately I feel their pizza is mediocre at best.  The pizza sauce has a sour taste to it pretty much calling attention to itself rather than harmonizing with the chosen toppings.  The crust just did not taste or feel like an expected brick oven pizza.  Not bad mind you but not on a par with the better pizzas in town.  For this I can not rate it more than two and a half to three stars.  I thought about coming back to try their pasta dishes but from past experiences like this, it seems restaurants uses the same red sauce on their pasta.  The iced tea was good.  The 14\" pizza, with 4 toppings and one drink and tax was not worth $25 plus!"}
{"text":"Being from the East Coast, it is hard to find an authentic New York pizza in AZ. Brooklyn V's is FANTASTIC!!!! Takes me back home.... The crust is fantastic with just the right amount of cheese. We've been here several times but haven't ordered anything other than pizza yet. Based on the other reviews,  trying the Stromboli next. Check this place out, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Being from NYS, I am very picky about the pizza I get.  This is as close as it gets in AZ! Great value for the money, and the family is always friendly to us when we come in.  I like it so much, I've earned a place on the wall!"}
{"text":"There is not one negative thing that I can say about this place.  Everything is A+ The food is fresh, made when ordered! Service has always been on point,  We can never  make up our minds on what to get so we end up ordering a ton and taking leftovers.   Recommended: Garlic knots Bruschetta (A++) Chicken Marsala ...always gotta get a pie too... why the heck not!  This is definitely one of the places we will miss the most about moving away from Gilbert (we moved to San Diego)!"}
{"text":"Tale of two restaurants. Last week we ordered from Brooklyn V 's and it was fantastic all around,  we ordered in the afternoon. Tonight we ordered and it was completely opposite so greesy we could not even finish it, we also ordered wings and they were less then average too. Super disappointed especially after our first experience. Way over priced for the quality and lack of attention to detail."}
{"text":"Try their antipasto salad...a meal in itself! Crust and sauce closest to NY I've found in 20 yrs of living here."}
{"text":"We're east coasters and we have to agree, their pizza is great.  Relative newcomers to AZ, it was great to find a taste of \"home\". Anne was a great server and we learned that she was going to be the manager of their new location closer to where we live in the east valley. Congrats to all!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service! We will be back! Desiree is the hardest working, she does everything!"}
{"text":"Great people and food . Everything we tried is good. We happen to like the white pizza."}
{"text":"Very, very good! Great surprise find! Loved the food and don't forget the cheesecake it was yum!!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible I could tell the waitress was talking about me to a man behind the counter I felt very uncomfortable. the pizza was not very good got the buffalo chicken pizza and the bruschetta pizza had no flavor. I will not be returning. Also confused my total was $10 I got two $2.50 slices."}
{"text":"The BEST food in all of Gilbert! Zucchini sticks are amazing. Pizza is hot, cheesy, and so delicious. Caesar salad is the best I have ever had. Homemade cheesecake is unique and so good. The food and service are both fantastic every single time we go. Never a bad experience. My absolute  favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered some food from Brooklyn V's. When the food arrived they packed it all into a pizza box to hold the individual containers. Along with the food was a fairly large roach dead in the box.   When I called the restaurant they did not sound surprised nor did they even bother to apologize. I have to think that this says they have some sort of problem over there."}
{"text":"I tried this place today, and I was impressed. I had the 2 pizza slice & drink lunch special. The margherita pizza was fantastic. The crust was thin & crispy, which I usually don't like because other pizzerias either make it too hard or too limp. This crust was incredible. They also have delivery service. I will not order chain pizza again."}
{"text":"Just moved to the Phoenix area and found this little gem!  This will be my go to pizza and pasta place.  Being a fellow Brooklynite and having worked in a very similar pizza and pasta place in Charlotte NC, I can say that this is a great place!  I see why they have had to expand.  Everything from the bruschetta appetizer, the margherita pizza and white eggplant pizza and the freshly made specialty cheesecakes were delicious!  A little taste of home in the valley!  Can't wait to go back and have some of their pasta dishes!  Our server, Desiree, was awesome with excellent suggestions too!!"}
{"text":"We had Spaghetti and Meat Sauce and Zita.  The Meat Sauce was one of the best we ever had.  The music was \"Sinatra/Martin\" and it felt like we belonged.  Great place to eat, food was  excellent."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and find it very difficult to get good italian food in the valley! So I tried this place for lunch one day last week. I had the stromboli it was so good just like back home. I will definitely be back. Wish you guys were in South phoenix :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Best I can find in AZ. I'm from New Jersey and I consider myself an expert on pizza! But seriously this was the best I've found. Ask for Desiree she was the best. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Visited last night for dinner with friends.  Our party of 4 split a large 18\" pepperoni pizza and an order of 12 garlic knots.  The food was EXCELLENT!    I think the dough/crust MAKES the pizza and Brooklyn V's has it down pat.  This space has been occupied by a few pizza joints since I've lived in the area and I've never been too impressed - but I'll definitely be back to Brooklyn V's.    Other +'s: *Cannoli's - Very good! *Iced Tea - Fresh! *Friendly staff *Nice family/owners that took the time to say hello and welcome us to their establishment."}
{"text":"First timer and not bad def worth trying. Tried the eggplant and pizza very delicious..."}
{"text":"I have been on a pretty strict diet for the past 4 months and decided to have a cheat day.  I chose the margarita pizza and the cannoli's.  Pizza was not bad, kind of greasy.  I would not pay $30 for it again! Cannoli's were not bad at all.  All in all ok, but pricy for what it was."}
{"text":"I was craving spaghetti with meat sauce and just so happened to be at the intersection near this place. I usually prefer specialty Italian dishes but I ordered what I was craving and oh my gosh!!!!! I know spaghetti with meat sauce isn't a difficult dish but it was probably the best I've ever had! I have been around some really great Italian food and this place really impressed me. So glad that I found them and they aren't far from me!!"}
{"text":"THANK GOD, AND LITTLE BABYJESUS.  There is good pizza in Arizona.  Probably the best on the west coast also.      Truly great east coast pizza. Im from Boston, and after being here for 5 years finally found Brooklyn vs. Now im finally home, and can live in AZ without missing real pizza.      Espresso is perfect too.  Great, great place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Kid friendly, but food is grown-up worthy. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Desiree was awesome and treated us very friendly and made us feel welcome! The pizza is out of this world go try it!"}
{"text":"Ordered an eggplant parm hero and side order of meatballs. Both were solid. Meatballs could have been a bit bigger but other then that they were tasty. Being it was my first visit there and I wanted to add on a slice to my order ,Desireé set me up with a free slice of pizza while I waited for my take out order. I can say it definitely holds up to Long Island pizza. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"After reading all of the reviews I decided to take a chance and try this place.  I was not disappointed!  I ordered online for delivery.  My timeframe was 45-60 minutes.  Our food arrived before that timeframe.  Our food was hot and delicious!  We got pizza, cheese sticks and zucchini sticks.  The kids and the adults loved the pizza.  Everything was great!  I will definitely try this place again!  I can't wait to try some of the pasta dishes!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Their Margherita pizza is to die for, as well as their bruschetta (you can taste the fresh basil!). You can't go wrong with their hot wings either. I love that they sell pizza by the slice.   We tend to order delivery from here and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Jared was my server today and the food and service was outstanding! I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker this place delivers on the promise of a true NY style pizza in AZ. We're so happy a friend recommended Brooklyn V's to us!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop by for a slice of pizza after browsing the Goodwill next door one afternoon. I didn't expect to be belittled by the young blond woman behind the register when I asked if they had any lunch specials and inquired about single slices of pizza. After she gave me some attitude, I paid for one slice of pepperoni. I can't remember what I paid for it but I do remember her yelling across the restaurant to the cooks what I ordered and walked away without giving me a receipt. I said fuck this and left. I didn't even ask for a refund- just straight up left.   In the future, I hope to give this place another try because the place did look good and I was anxious to try it but sometimes the hassle just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing.   Garlic Knotts.   Chicken Marsala, and the pizza is top notch.   I am an east coast pizza snob and this pizza is LEGIT! !!! Come and try this place you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"1st time here and we loved it..... family owned and everyone was sooooo friendly. Pizza and pasta both delicious. We went on a night were they had live entertainment and the whole family had a blast."}
{"text":"After the last time we went and left a review, we haven't been back, but decided to order food from there again because I found the gift card the manager had given me, and we were craving pizza. I couldn't remember what the balance on the card was so I had called to check the balance. And to my surprise the balance was a big fat ZERO. Not sure what happened there, but we laughed and didn't even want to question it. Thanks for the gift card! lol"}
{"text":"Placed an order online, asking for a 6:30 p.m. delivery on a Thursday night. Delivery was right on time, to the minute. We ordered a huge mushroom and ham pizza, house salad, and cannoli. The pizza was perfect - not too much cheese, plenty of toppings, the sauce had a great tang, and the crust was that combination of crunchy / chewy that I love. We had to half the pizza because it was enormous! The salad was fresh, although light on the tomatoes - it was a good size for the price. The cannoli (3) were fresh and just the right size - I even had 1 leftover for the next day and only then was it starting to get soft. I'll definitely order from Brooklyn V's again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very pleasant surprise to walk into. With it being kind of tucked in the corner of a shopping center that hasn't seemed to have much success, you would just be expecting a cheap pizza place that doesn't serve much more than average pizza and maybe some wings.   Brooklyn V's offers a very pleasant, homey feel when you walk inside and the staff is very friendly. They are very grateful for your business and deliver a menu and quality of food that makes you want to come back for more.   Within the last week or two I have already eaten here twice and nothing has yet to disappoint. Portions are extremely generous and the quality of food is something you would expect at a restaurant charging a steeper price.   For my first visit, me and my girlfriend split a 12 or 14 inch pizza (can't remember the exact size, but not the largest size) and a Caesar salad. The Caesar salad had just the right amount of dressing and tasted about as good as a Caesar salad can get. It was also served on a chilled plate, which added a nice touch. The size of the salad was quite large and could probably feed at least 3 as an appetizer before the meal. The pizza came out a few minutes later and was quite delicious. A NY style pie that had the right amount of crispness to it, which is tough to come across. Most NY style pizzas are pretty flimsy, but Vito seems to have a great recipe. I am a stickler on Pizza and this easily satisfied me. About as good as I could expect out of a pizza that wasn't cooked in a wood fired brick oven.   During my second visit I decided to venture out and try the Bow tie pasta with pesto sauce. I am not a huge pasta person but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and portion size once again. During this visit, we also decided to try Vito's cannolis and that was an EXCELLENT choice. The cannolis were superb and I have been craving them ever since.   I would give Brooklyn V's a 4 1/2 star rating if that were possible on yelp. The only things I wish differently would be that the plates were maybe a dollar or two cheaper ($10 for a pasta plate, I think the salad was somewhere between $5.50-7 and then a 1-topping 12 or 14 inch pizza was $16) and I think the speed of service will improve with experience. Overall, Brooklyn V's provides a much higher quality of food and service than you would expect out of a place tucked back in the corner of a Goodwill shopping center, next to a smoke shop. I have encouraged others to try it and the one family that did was very happy, so I hope others enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"I was really excited walking in and hearing all the accents and such, but if this is New York pizza, I'd rather stick with Arizona.   Pizza was not terrible, but the sauce was way too watery. Everything slid off of our pizza. They also seemed to be big on the oil as well. Both the pizza and knots had excessive amounts of oil.   The service was great and the staff was friendly, which is why I say 3 stars. Would I return? No. Not with all the great choices in the area. $28 for a med pizza, knots, and drink."}
{"text":"I ordered for a large group and every single person was in love with the food. The penne pasta with vodka sauce was amazing, the lasagna was fresh and just perfect. The tie knots were a HUGE HIT! But those meatballs were to die for! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We finally decided to try this place after living just a few miles away for a few years.  Very glad we finally did.     We sat down and it took 4-5 minutes before a server came to the table so I started to get a little nervous.   After our server came she ended up being great.  She came to check on us often and was very friendly and helpful.    They have 4 beers on tap.  Kiltlifter, an IPA, Shocktop and Bud Light.    We ordered a pizza and a stromboli.    The pizza was New York thin style.  I thought it was fantastic.  One of the best I've had in AZ.    The stromboli was also great.  We added ham and pepperoni.  It was only $1 to add each additional item.  I think there was 1/2\" of both added in.  The stromboli tasted fantastic.  When I go back I'll get the stromboli again for sure.     I would really recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Just moved in the area and this is top of our pizza list. Amazing pizza, the (I assume) owner, walked around greeting everyone. Nice wait staff, fast service, good prices and really good food. I got pizza and wings and they were both amazing. Perfect New York style pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great place to bring a group  Came here after church had 2 14\" pizzas  the 3 v's  meat pizza and a all cheese Bianca pizza both were great we also had some garlic knots for starters very cheap and very good  Loved the setting and the staff, nice open kitchen so you can watch your pizza an food being made  The Owner coming and welcoming us and checking on our food was a nice touch too  Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Just moved into this area and our favorite pizza place Barros is a ways away. Tried Brooklyn V's and love it!  We order a pizza and the wonderful garlic knots once a week. Thanks for the great food!"}
{"text":"I accidently stumbled upon Brooklyn V's last night. I was headed to another pizza place to try for the first time but it was closed. I decided to get a slice and a salad. They get points for offering a slice right off the bat.  1. The crust was perfect, very true to the Brooklyn way. Flavorful. A+  2. The sauce was very nice, I do like a little more sauce, but it was quality. A+  3. Ingredients - Sausage- A.  Roasted Pepper- A+.  Eggplant- A. (It was very good, however it was tossed in tasty bread crumbs, but I do prefer the eggplant without the crumbs.)   4. Salad - I ordered a simple dinner salad with Ceasar dressing. Lettuce was a mix of greens and Romajne. Very crisp and fresh. Ceasar Dressing- A+  5. Service- I can't comment too much as I was a carry out, but the young lady who took my order was very nice, I didn't ask, but she brought me a glass of water while I waited and that always gets points. She knew the menu well when I was deciding on my order and possible future orders.   I will be back to dine in for sure."}
{"text":"Great service!! Great food!! It's been difficult finding Stromboli in Arizona but Brooklyn V's do it and they do it right!!! I had the Stromboli with sausage, pepperoni and meatballs! They did not skimp out on meat or cheese!!! It was oozing cheese!!! So delicious!! We will be back to try the pizzas and pastas which all look amazing! Everyone was super friendly and made us feel welcome. I even saw the owner come out and shake hands with patrons. This is why it's so important to support local businesses especially when they are as worthy as this one!!! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!  This is a great little find.  tucked in the corner, real mom/pop feel.  The bread knots were a fun appetizer (amazingly priced) and my family enjoyed a pepperoni pizza.  the red sauces were fantastic!!  Vito himself even came out and chatted with us for a few.  Nice atmosphere, great food, great price.  You've got a customer here!!! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Man these guys are awesome. I had the pizza and it's the best in Arizona when it comes to TRUE NY style. Just beautiful. Next I went to eat in and turns out it's a full service restaurant with beer and wine as well. Great service, and everything on the menu looked amazing. I ordered the eggplant Parmesan because I've been trying to find it in Arizona for years. Best I've  had outside of New York. Thin layers, great sauce, great flavor. Highly recommend! The owners are great! Thanks, Eric"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in a Italian neighborhood  in the Bronx. So I think I know a thing or two about good pizza and Italian food. Brooklyn V's is the real deal authentic New York Italian cuisine. Phenomenal customer service as well."}
{"text":"We have been there several times..the food is always delicious. It definately has an authentic taste of Brooklyn pizza and other Italian food...we are from Brooklyn so I speak from experience....the staff is so accommodating  and courteous. .love this place"}
{"text":"I love this place!! It's so nice to find new place that I'm excited to go back to! The pizza is delicious and I love the crispy crust. The service was very friendly, live music and the atmosphere feels cozy, not like a chain. We will be coming back here with the whole family soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"great place ...even better food!!!! and our server Desiree was phenomenal!! we will definitely be back again!1"}
{"text":"Always great food!  After moving here from NY finding a pizza joint is difficult to do but taste just like New York pizza!!"}
{"text":"Ate at Brooklyn Vs last night.  We were a group of about 25 people.  No fuss, no hassle.  Anna and the crew got us all setup with a private room and helped us with selections from their catering menu.     The food was great.  We did about 6 pizzas, a half tray of meatballs and three half tray pastas and two half tray salads.  Everything was excellent and the meatballs in particular were a standout with our group.   Was just the right amount of food and what we had leftover, they generously packaged for us to take back to our hotel.   We could've maybe done one less pasta, but everyone enjoyed the added variety as did I.    And while everything we had was delicious, it was the service that really stood out.  Anna personally took care of our group with some help from a few of the other girls on the wait staff and they did a fantastic job keeping the drinks, beer and wine flowing.  Everyone in my group was complementary of the service.    A lot of places make large group arrangements a hassle.  Not here.  It was painless start to finish and culminated in a great evening for our large family gathering.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a simple, yet satisfying solution for a large group gathering that can fit any budget."}
{"text":"I LOVE me some Brooklyn V's!  I want every reader to keep one thing in mind; I have never ordered delivery or carry-out from Brooklyn V's. I'm rating solely on my many dining experiences at the restaurant. Yes, their cheeses are ooey and gooey and remarkably NOT greasy. But considering what's going to happen to it once you have it in your mouth, I'd eat a messy box full of food that tastes THIS good any day of the week.  It's so cute inside since they've redone the place, and their selection of music is exactly what you'd want to hear while you're snarfing down Italian food. And the food! This is some good ass sh*t, my Yelp friends.   I have tried a variety of their appetizers and pastas, the stromboli, the pizza, and the Eggplant Rollatini-- which is out of this world! The food is so good, and so filling, I never have room for dessert. But, for the second time, I've taken dessert home to have later, and YUM, I'm so glad I did.   Pop on by, grab a seat, and forget they even deliver pizza. This is Italian comfort food at its best!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this place needs another positive review. With over 200 reviews and most everyone of them five stars, I'm not sure there is much new that I can say. We found this business through Yelp, and gave it a try today. My oh my, am I glad we did! This is a long lost discovered treasure, a diamond in the rough, a place that helps put Gilbert on the map!  We started with the adventure with cheese garlic knots. I had two slices of pepperoni pizza and my better half had the pesto bow tie pasta with chicken. Fantastic and flavorful on all accounts. The sauce, the cheese, the crust.... yum! Finished it off with a nice sweet Snickers pie.  We were able to meet the owners Anna and Vito, the latter who made it a point to come out of the kitchen from hand tossing his pizza dough to see how our meal was. Wonderful people and very personable.  There are few and far amazing pizza places around the Valley, and this is one of them. If you are in the Gilbert area, just out and about looking for a place to try, or happen to live nearby but maybe have been stuck under a rock, you really owe it to yourself to try it out.  What really topped everything off for us was the news they will be opening a new location in Queen Creek which will be much closer to our home. It was like a late Christmas present!   Congrats to both of them on that big news and much continued success to Brooklyn V's Pizza!"}
{"text":"It had really good reviews so we gave it a shot as we always support the small businesses in our neighborhood. We ordered the Penne Vodka pizza as it's one of our favorites at another establishment. I'm sure we should have ordered the regular cheese pizza. It had absolutely no flavor. We asked our waitress for a side of marinara hoping it would help. No luck. On the subject of our waitress, she was efficient and well trained. She was a definite plus. We still haven't decided if we will return to try the regular cheese but if we do I will update my review."}
{"text":"We celebrated my daughter's first birthday here last night and could not have been more impressed. My wife reserved a table for our party and the staff was not only accommodating, but went above and beyond by decorating our table with balloons, birthday napkins and even had a special candle for the cake. The food was phenomenal.  My party tried garlic knots, spaghetti and pizza. Everything tasted delicious and the pizza was excellent. Cheese, sauce, garlic, pepperoni, spinach and dough all came together perfectly.   Beer and wine were very reasonably priced and the live music completed the night. The staff was very attentive to our needs and I cannot say enough about how welcomed they made all of us feel. This is a family owned business that shows tremendous pride in quality and preparation of food and care for their patrons. A big thank you to the entire staff at Brooklyn V's for making my daughter's first birthday one that we will never forget."}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant has become our weekly family date night go to! From their pizza to pasta, you can't go wrong! Their wings are my husband's absolute favorite! A must try!"}
{"text":"We had calzones and they were tasty. Service was friendly but a tad slower than we liked. Still, we will be back to try more of the menu. The cannolis were quite good as well!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We moved from NYC 2 1/2 years ago and have been to many pizzerias where we have been told it's just like NY pizza and each have fallen short. My husband found this place on Yelp and OMG this is it. Cheese pizza reminds us of back home. We went back today with his brother and family and we ate and ate and ate. Cheese pizza, V3 pizza, eggplant pizza and the bianco pizza--- yum yum yum! The mini zeppolis  and cannolis are delish. We are definitely going back to try the calzones and pasta dishes. It's a 20 min drive from home and so worth it."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  The crust on the pie was amazing!  Taste great.  It's the kind of slice that you can't really cut with a fork and knife; stays stiff without flopping when you pick it up.  Staff was really nice.  The owner/chef even made a round to ask everyone how their meal was, told us some of the secrets to the amazing cheesecake recipe.  The waiter told us that the owner only makes a couple of the cheesecakes every month.  \"Once they are gone, they're gone\".  Glad we got in on it, it was light, fluffy, delicious.   We were there early by 4:45. There was about 4 tables w customers.  The kitchen was buzzing w preparation and to go orders. More people came in as it got later; definitely a busy place.   The strip mall where this divine pizza is located is so-so.   It looked like it was closing down but there was definitely life at Brooklyn Vs.  Pizza wise-this place tops out in rank of my favorite authentic pizzas in Gilbert:  #1 Brooklyn V, #2 Sals Gilbert Pizza #3 Casanova.  If I include location and dining room in my ranking then I would probably have Sals or Casanova (new location) in the top #1 & #2.  I'm eager to go back to Brooklyn V with the kids. I brought home some slices and they loved it."}
{"text":"We just tried their sausage, meatball and pepperoni Stromboli and it is by far our new favorite!!! It's a must try :) We also got an order of canolis, not a fan - we ended up throwing away."}
{"text":"Really solid pizza. This was a surprise to me. While the pizza is greasier than expected, once its had a little time to settle it tastes great. Really nice atmosphere. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Bida bing budda boom, food is great but service is ah, unfriendly to say the least! Courtesy and respect is everything, pizza is great but your missing the respect part!"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh! I was first pleased at how good the ranch dressing was, light, not heavy.   I ordered pizza, which was great, but immediately thought the baked ziti looked so good...I'll be back!   The price is super for the quality and I'd recommend anyone that likes New York style pizza give this place a try."}
{"text":"We tried this place out today for lunch based on reading Yelp reviews.  We are so glad we did!  Do not be put off by the extremely low key appearance from the front of this strip mall restaurant.  I am from the NY Metro area and am constantly searching for good Italian food that isn't pretentiously overpriced.  This place is definitely family run; the chef's wife Desiree served us.  We started with the ubiquitous garlic knots (6 for $2.25!) that came with a lovely marinara sauce on the side.  Then we had a marvelous Caprese salad.  The mozzerella was so fresh, I would not doubt it was house made and the drizzle of balsamic and olive oil was so good I wanted to lick the plate.  The Eggplant Parmesan was to die for!  Slice thinly and just crispy at the edges, served with pasta or salad.  YUM!  My husband's Penna with Vodka Sauce was also yummy and a very generous helping.  We forced outselves to stop eating (doggie bags) so we could enjoy some freshly baked Penaut Butter Cup cheesecake the chef had just made that morning while he was \"experimenting.\"  Experiment away!  Our server was his wife Desiree who was delightful and accommodating with just the right amount of Brooklyn hospitality (and accent!).  We will definitely be back to try the hand tossed pizza which is also available by the slice.  I kicked myself we didn't try one to give it the ultiate litmus test!  We will definitely be back.  Thank you Desiree!"}
{"text":"Damn good Pizza!...and the pepperoni strombolli was very good too. Friendly and courteous staff.  We will definitely be repeat customers."}
{"text":"Crust is really good-perfect NY style. Not too saucy. However, our 1/2 pepperoni,  1/2 sausage take out was fairly greasy. I had to sop up the puddles with napkins before serving. Also, the sausage had a strange taste. Wasn't really seasoned-just a funky meat taste. My son enjoyed his pepperoni slice. Restaurant was packed, so I am wondering if their other menu items are better? As I was picking up my take out, I saw staff talking with the eat in customers-that was cool. Counter help was friendly."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this wonderful spot while looking for something that would satisfy a deep chicken parmigiana craving I was having at the time. Ordered it to go (I know), however to my delight it was packaged and wrapped up perfectly with a plate underneath! NOBODY puts that amount of care into to go food! That's what I thought until I came here. I was then immediately planning my next meals around coming back. I don't remember the second meal but after the 5th time here, I will never forget this restaurant. From the team working here (Desiree is a riot to talk with) and the incredibly well prepared menu, I have experienced nothing but the best while here. DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED on the nice touches with the music, the many pictures of families, and welcome decor. I truly can't speak highly enough of this restaurant. Thank you for the food, and the good times I have had here at Brooklyn V's."}
{"text":"This pizza took an hour and a half to get to be delivered. The pizza arrived room temperature and with a disgusting black char on the bottom of the crust.If you have enough time to wait for this trash, just hop in the car and go grab yourself a frozen pizza.    *Scrapes tongue with a spoon*"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and will definitely make this place a regular choice for fresh, tasty Italian food."}
{"text":"Had spaghetti meatballs and vodka penne comparable to las Vegas quality pastas five stars!"}
{"text":"First time there - The white pizza and wings were awesome.  Since it was our first time, they gave us complimentary cannolis.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ask people, \"where can I find good New York style pizza.\"  Then I go where they say, I'm disappointed and then ask, \"Have you ever eaten pizza in New York?\" The answer is \"no\" and I kick myself every time for not asking that first.  As an East Coast transplant (who has had pizza multiple times in New York), this is the closest to real New York pizza I have found. (No offense to Sal's, which seems a local favorite, but Sal's sauce tasted like Chef Boyardee.) It's really frustrating to grow up with great pizza your whole life just to discover the rest of the country has no clue how to make it.   I've not yet had bad service, but as an east-coaster,  I don't expect the place to open up like freakin' Beast's kitchen for Belle (be our guest, be our guest) either.   This is my go to pizza place. Now if they would only sell it for Lil Caesar prices."}
{"text":"3/10/17  Emily is running the front .... great job !!!   Training very well !   4/20/17 not too busy tonight ! We still love this place !  Maddy is working tonight she's so sweet ! Thank you   It's our go to spot especially when family comes to visit from New York !  No ones been disappointed!   Thank you guys !!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazingly great food. Owner is super nice and friendly. Good prices and very clean inside and out. Taste flavor everything absolutely amazing. First time here found my new home for pizza definitely won't go anywhere else now. If your ever in Gilbert Arizona don't pass up this place without stopping in and grabbing something to eat. Thanks for the great food experience and service."}
{"text":"The cannoli dessert was excellent. The actual chicken of the chicken Marsala was decent enough but I had to add seasoning because it was pretty bland. Marsala is a wine sauce and there was a hint of traditional flavor but the spaghetti served with it which they pour the sauce over was boxed flavorless. No one serves spaghetti Marsala. Usually it's veal or chicken Marsala. Take a hint when one is offered. The mushrooms were used sparingly and I suspect they were either canned or boiled beyond flavor recognition. Ordered the garlic knots with cheese. Hint: Don't because what you get is a ton of cheese and practically no garlic and no oil which I believe was not pure Italian olive oil but either a 10% Blend or canola oil. They give you some type of bread loaf that looks store bought.  OVERALL: I paid $28.32 for chicken Marsala, garlic knots and cannoli. That's not cheap but the ingredients were the cheapest available. Maybe the pizza is better but ALL the Yelp reviews rave about what I ordered. Hint: season chicken before dredging in flour. Fine tune your Marsala sauce so one can recognize it. The spaghetti Marsala does it no favors. Use fresh mushrooms and make sure they are recognizable as such. Yes you may have to make each dish to order or add mushrooms as you go but making a stock Marsala and using it all day............Come up with a side dish that compliments the Marsala. Maybe a pasta with olive oil and garlic or a fettuccine alfredo. You're making Pizza..... bake your own bread and use Parmesan or Romano Cheese on your knots. The cheap mozzarella is gross once it cools.  If you like to pay a good price for cheap ingredients this is your spot. For me.... No thanks."}
{"text":"Went here as a Mother's Day treat. The resturaunt was mostly empty and the staff welcomed us in warmly. We started with garlic knots which were very good and not overpowering. The marinara sauce tasted fresh with tomato chunks in it. The calamari appetizer looked generic like onion rings and tasted bland. They reminded me of something you'd find in your grocer's freezer aisle. The antipasto salad was disappointing. Instead of layering the ingredients, it looked like there was only one type of meat, three types of cheeses, and some type of vinaigrette dressing. We added jalapeños to the BBQ Chicken Ranch Pizza and it was great.  We had another pizza with half pepperoni and half three meat Vs which had meatballs on top. It had a strong flavor the many didn't agree with.  Overall it was pleasant and we may return."}
{"text":"I would typically give them a 5 for the food ... I'm not a fan of the pizza but the pasta dishes, chicken Marsala, garlic knots and Caesar salad are fantastic!  My 3 stars are for the service. Which seems to be getting worse each time we go. Typically they have one gal running around by herself managing all the tables. We cut her a break because she seems to be on her own. The owners are usually focused on the take-out or chatting with their regulars.  The last 3 times I have dined-in we have waited up to 10 minutes to be acknowledged ... Up to 20 minutes for drinks and water, sometimes garlic knots. And up to an hour for our dinner! The dinners all come separate. The really weird thing is the kids get their meals last. My food gets cold waiting for theirs. I am not sure if they are understaffing due to cost. I'm really getting frustrated by it and our visits are getting less frequent because of it."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza, but not my favorite. I've had it a couple times and each time I am less and less impressed."}
{"text":"We ordered and picked up our food. The phone was picked up promptly and the lady that was taking the order was very nice and informative. We ordered the Bianco pizza, stuffed shells and cannolis. Our order was ready in 20min. The lady at the counter was very friendly and quick to grab our food. The food was about $30 which isn't to bad. The pizza was awesome! It has fresh ingredients and the mozzarella was soooo good!!! The stuffed shells were seasoned wonderfully with some really tasty marinara. Lastly the cannolis tasted like my grandmothers which is saying a lot in a great way. :) They had chocolate chips with a slightly sweet ricotta filling. Other places tend to make these to sweet which ruins them. You have to have the right balance of sweetness, crunch and creaminess from the ricotta. Soooo this place gets a thumbs up!! Yum!"}
{"text":"First time in tonight. Garlic knots were heavenly! Pizza and fettuccine did not disappoint. Fresh peanut butter cup cheesecake was amazing!"}
{"text":"So far ????? It's been a wait for a pickup order --- longest minute ever and seems very disorganized at the cash register--- after 43 minutes still waiting. Wait staff did offer water while we waited but still waiting on that --- pick up order/service is horrendous"}
{"text":"Wow! We recently moved back to Pennsylvania about two months ago but we definitely miss Brooklyn V's! We spontaneously decided to visit Brooklyn V's one night and it was certainly worth it. We got pizza, pasta, meatballs, sausage and cannoli. O-M-G! Wonderful! Food has always been amazing every time we went there (we visited around 10 times), it's always hot and the tomato/marinara sauce is FABULOUS. Great environment as well. We were there once when there was live music, such a wonderful family feel. Great and friendly service. We ordered a pizza for delivery one time as well too and the pizza came just as hot and delicious as if we had gotten it right there in the restaurant. Absolutely 5 stars without a doubt."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time.  We had the margarita and meat lovers.  Both were great.  We'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Just opened in Queen Creek, we had Pesto Chicken pizza and Pineapple/Ham pizza and  Cannolis, great staff and great food, I will be back with more friends too. This place will be a local favorite I have no doubt. Thank you Anna for great service too."}
{"text":"Excellent food; I highly recommend the chicken penne vodka pizza and the garlic knots with cheese. Amazing!! The best cannolis I've ever had! Shoutout to our server Dominic, awesome service."}
{"text":"I've lived in Gilbert AZ for 11 years and surprisingly  never knew this place was tucked in the corner a mile down the road. Great yelp ratings so decided to try it.    Girl at the front was pleasant and my pizza was ready when I got there which was surprising as I expected to sit down and have a beer while I wait.   Got home with the 2 pizzas and was immediately disappointed. Cheese pizza was utterly a sloppy,  gooey, doey mess.  Pizza cheese was all slid over to the side.  Pizza not sliced all the way thru.  The pizza was really doey underdone.  Really disappointing. The meat lover pie had good flavor w the toppings but again the doe was just too under done."}
{"text":"This place always has awesome food. Look forward to coming back. Try the Bruschetta pizza, AMAZING!!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best pizza we've finally found in Gilbert! NY style at its best! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Just tried Brooklyn's based on Yelp reviews. Pizza is outstanding. Will definitely be back. Upon entering this place you can tell right away this is a family run establishment. Very genuinely friendly staff. I noticed the other patrons and there were smiles at every table. Next time, I'm going for the sausage and peppers hero. It looks amazingly delicious."}
{"text":"This was great food tonight. Absolutely try the ricotta and eggplant pizza . Sounds crazy but it is amazing. If you are a pasta person, try the meat sauce on anything. Excellent. Fun staff and decent prices. Try the canoli too. Wow!"}
{"text":"The only thing that's making this two stars is that our waitress was nice. Live in the neighborhood, used to be a fan. Will not return. Slow service cold food."}
{"text":"The food is some of the best Italian food I've had! Great staff very friendly. Jenna waited on us and we loved her! My philly born and bread Italian husband said the food took him back home.  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"OMG! THIS IS THE PLACE for an authentic NY Italian meal!!!! My man decided on a whim that I was going to try a new place after he had tried it for lunch. He said he couldn't wait to take me to Brooklyn V's.  I am a very picky eater and I am not a fan of chains so I was really happy to support a small business that really knows its business!  We started with these little bread things they call garlic knots that come with marinara  YUM! This was starting out fantastic. You can tell a lot from the marinara, ya know ;)   We each ordered a Stromboli and they were to die for! I could have cut it lengthwise and just crawled in, they do kinda look like sleeping bags. You know when you taste something so good the world just kinda stops spinning? Yeah......Oh sorry!  We took a tiramisu home to split for later. The waitress said it was heaven in a box. I haven't had too much luck with tiramisu here in AZ so I wasn't too excited. A couple hours later her words were still echoing in my head and I just had to taste it.  Fireworks shot off! The band started playing and suddenly I was in Italy! Reluctantly I put the other half (well almost half, he he)  back in the fridge for my man.  The liquor license is coming folks!"}
{"text":"Sat 12 noon 3 tables of customers, the owner in his sparkling white jacket.  He saw us enter and turned away to engage with the table nearby.  We sat ourselves , yet nobody greeted us.  I have have been to these \"dives\" before- it is step up to the counter and order-thus we did.  No signs or greeters... 25 minutes later- our over priced $15 pepperoni 14\" pizza, arrived at our table.  The crust  was flat (yeast failure) and greasy, the cheese, looked and tasted CHEAP.  This is the second visit to this establishment, never again."}
{"text":"I am not from New York, I have never been to New York. I have no expectations for pizza based on my old New York neighborhood or from childhood memories. Growing up in Mexico, pizza choices in the small town of Agua Prieta were somewhat limited to a couple of restaurants that served pies that had one thing in common to New York style pizza, the shape was round.  Hungry last night, after a very stressful day at work, we wanted some food to be delivered to us. We wanted to be able to order it without hassle and we wanted it delivered fast. Demanding, I know. In this area ,Brooklyn V's Pizza delivered. I ordered it online, in a very easy to use website, they delivered it to my home and took about 45 minutes, which is a great time on a friday night.  The pizza we ordered was the buffalo chicken pizza, not a very traditional pie, but I had been wanting to try it. The cost for an 18\" pie was $20.00, a little on the expensive side. I was hoping for a delicious pizza, and I am not going to lie, the dough had very good flavor, but that was it. The chicken was extremely salty, to the point that we had to take it off the pizza, which wasn't a big task because there hardly was any chicken on the pizza to begin with, and the worst is the chicken was way too dry, and it hardly had any  buffalo sauce in it. So I wasn't too pleased with this pie, but I am sure if I stick to a classic next time, they will do better in this department.  We also ordered a cheese calzone with bacon and their garlic knots and those were the highlight of our meal. The calzone was filled with lots of cheese and bacon and tasted delicious. The garlic knots and the accompanying marinara sauce were so delicious we were fighting over them.   I would definitely go back to Brooklyn V's pizza and probably eat in and order a more traditional pie or something else off the menu. For a pizza, a calzone and the order of knots I spent $45.00 including delivery and tip."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, delivered on time! I ordered garlic knots because of someone else's recommendation.  The dipping sauce is excellent. The knots need more garlic."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special, 2 slices and a soda for $5.75. I think it's a great deal and the pizza was delicious. I'm picky when it comes to my pizza crust and they didn't burn it which was great. Sometimes places that have thinner crust blacken their pizza before it comes to the table but it arrived hot and the perfect crispiness. This place is tucked away in a strip mall, but it doesn't take away from the great prices and good food."}
{"text":"this is a pretty good place to find some good new York style cheese falls of into your mouth type of pizza if you get my drift. they also have other types of pasta available too that can be found in most Italian restaurants they have live music on the 2nd Saturday of every month from 6:30-9:30 so that's worth checking out too if you are in the Gilbert area. ."}
{"text":"This place is \"THE BEST\" Im a native New Yorker moved here 17 years ago.We have been looking for a GENUINE pizza place forever.Bingo...found it.Brooklyn V's  is the real deal.Pizza a TEN..Vodka sauce a TEN...Lasagna a TEN...Everything is a TEN Outstanding service, friendly atmosphere. Vito is a class act..only drawback wish it was closer to Queen Creek....worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have never written a review until now! This pizza is amazing! The thin crispy crust, large amount of toppings- I had meatballs, onion and muahroom- and generous portions! Friendly staff and Frank Sinatra crooning in the background! Also live music on Saturdays and an occasional Thursday! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"So good!!!  Real east coast Italiano!!!  Some favorites - eggplant parm - very authentic, thinly sliced!!  Ask for Desiree - awesome waitress with good recommendations."}
{"text":"Just moved here to Gilbert, Az and my family were in the mood for some Italian food. What an amazing experience and the food was amazing! Will definitely call you guys again! My family and loved your food!  Best  Gil and Joni L."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a slice and had the opportunity to meet Vito (owner) who made it a point to introduce himself and ask how everything was. Not only was the sausage pizza fresh and amazing, but having Vito come by to say hi is something that's rare. The pizza alone is reason enough for me to come back, but Vito makes this place special. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Pizza is one of the best I've had. Service can be a toss up. There is an older lady there, maybe one of the owners? She's accommodating, but not very warm. Any who, I'm just being picky. Pizza is definitely with the trip. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I give this joint five stars.   I'm from Chicago and have been to hundreds of pizza joints.  As a retired cop I knew all the \"hidden gems\" all the family joints etc etc.   been here for 5 years and my first order from here .   The simplicity of the pie is spot on.  Crust, chewy, crips like a good NewYork bagel .   Very friendly when I walked in.     GREAT PIE!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always so great and has had recent renovations to male the dining area larger! Everybody is so nice!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been in Arizona for 6 years now, and finally found a pizza place that reminds of back home Long Island New York! The buffalo chicken pie is by far the best pizza pie! Garlic knots are awesome(just remember to make sure the marinara sauce is in the bag before you leave, they tend to say it's in the tin and no it's not).  We have still have to sit down one day and have a meal, but the pizza is just so good! So glad to finally have a found a little taste of home! Oo and make sure to give your phone number for the points, we have gotten a bunch of free pies already!!"}
{"text":"We looked at the reviews and thought we would try a new place, what a mistake. When we walked in not greeted, she said dine in sit over there. We sat in a booth it felt like no AC was working and they only had 2 tables with people. We then waited for 10 min and nobody came to take a drink order or even came by. We got up and drove 10 miles down Warner to Rigatonys. The place is busy had our drinks within 2 min of sitting down so happy we came here. Sorry Brooklyn V's my money must not be good enough for you."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Gilbert. Bruschetta is super flavorful. Owner come out and thanked us since this was our first visit. We will be back to try their entrees."}
{"text":"Ask for Desirée she is the best server she knows the menu, including off the menu dishes that are to die for.  The owners are on hand ready to cook up fresh delicious food. Everything we had was just that, fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is inviting and family friendly. We caught part of the football game on one of the many tv's on the wall.  The restaurant as a whole has the feeling of a New York restaurant (minus the shopping center). I will bring the entire family next time. Although we didn't try the pizza we were satisfied with our choices. I had the chicken Marsala it was rich and delicious. The extra crispy wings were perfection. Off the menu item was a bowl of spaghetti with peppers and Italian sausages. We also got to try these buttery Garlic rolls they were a garlic lovers dream. Don't get me started on desert. Cannolis and cheesecake of the day reminded me of New York's little Italy in the middle of Saint Gennaro festival. Do your self a favor and enjoy a great delicious time at V's!"}
{"text":"If you love Italian food like Stromboli, Calzone, Pizza and pasta this is the best choice for that home cooked quality.  Great portions, great service and the quality of the food is outstanding!  You must try this place!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots were excellent, as was the marinara sauce for dipping.  I would say the pizza wasn't anything super special but it was tasty for sure.  The hot wings were good as well- the sauce was very good- the actual wings could have had a bit more meat on them. We ordered a 7 count and recieved only actual wings- no drum sticks, but they weren't the puniest wings I've ever had, so all in all they were more than decent.  We ordered online through Yelp and it took about an hour for delivery, which was a bit longer than the original quote but not outrageous.  We will definitely be repeat customers!"}
{"text":"$18 for a medium margarita pizza? This better blow my mind. Unfortunately, it was just \"good\". I would have given it 4 stars if it was appropriately priced."}
{"text":"Well we are back.  Had their special 18\" pizza and 12 wings for $19.99 and they made a mistake on our order since we wanted 1/2 cheese and 1/2 sausage and mushrooms and it was all sausage and mushrooms. So the waitress said they are making another 14\" cheese for free and she brought another 18\"!!!! For free!  Ay ay ay!!!  I also had a free dessert for my birthday and asked if I could use it now or next time. She said of course now!  They didn't have their Oreo cookie cheesecake so I ordered the cannoli. So super nice and great tasting food. Will have to try their pasta dishes soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  The only reason I didn't give V's five stars is because it's a little pricey.  But the food is great.  We met the owners and when they found out it was our first time they helped us pick a few things from the menu.  The food we chose gave us a good idea of their taste, style, and preparation.  It is hidden in the corner of a strip mall and mainly advertise online.  Take the time to find it, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I'm so bummed I didn't have the same experience as everyone else with the pizza.   I placed the order through yelp delivery. It initially said 45 min to 1 hour. Great! I placed and paid for my order. Then I go through my email to check the tracker and the bump up my delivery time to an hour and a half. Whoa! I guess I don't have a choice now that I paid.   The food is delivered and I missed meeting the delivery person so I had no interaction with the staff.  I ordered : BBQ chicken pizza, bruschetta pizza , and pepperoni pizza .... Honestly I can appreciate this pizza and see how people could love it. I just wasn't one of those people. It was just OK. It could be that I am not a fan of \"real\" pizza... I really have no idea. Again, the pizza definitely was not bad, just not to my taste and a bit overpriced.   Would I try this place again? Yes, sometimes first impressions are deceiving"}
{"text":"Really awesome pasta dishes, I love the fact they don't use sausage in every dish.  Wished they had garlic bread as a side.  Pizza is good, wife likes it a lot more than I do, probably wouldn't order it if not for her.  Side salads are pricey but entrees will leave you enough for lunch the next day and are priced right.  Nothing fancy , real casual but yummy."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My favs are the pepperoni pizza, garlic knots and spaghetti with meat sauce! If You haven't tried Brooklyn V's, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Pretty good casual pizza place. The servers were nice. I ordered the garlic knots with cheese and the Penne Vodka pizza with added sausage. The homemade marinara for the knots was a little watery and I prefer mine thicker, but it had great flavor. The 14' pizza was a good size to share for 2 or 3 people. The crust could have been a little crispier in my opinion. It wasn't too thin or thick, a perfect size. I probably wouldn't order the same pizza again, would rather try something else. The bruschetta is a favorite."}
{"text":"very good, thin crust, foldable pizza! tried the regular pizza and a bianco pizza and both were amazing. the crust is great, slightly golden and light and the flavors were rich and good. the quality of ingredients was definitely noticeable relative to cheap chain pizza."}
{"text":"I like to say that this is a hidden gem in Gilbert.  I dont usually like Italian food but this was authentic and home grown.  It was the best experience I have had and it was so cute and quaint.  I could take my kids and they enjoyed it also.  The owner is really friendly and good people."}
{"text":"When I see the name Brooklyn I think I'm getting NY style food. It's way more Chicago than Brooklyn. Food wasn't bad but definitely not great and not what I expected. Hit up Sal's if you're looking for real NY food.  Oh yeah and CNN on all three TVs? What is this the airport???? Forcing me to watch that was gut wrenching. How about giving your customers some variety???"}
{"text":"Best Pie in town !!! Service is outstanding !!! We ordered by phone and our pizza when ready to serve with in 2 mins of being seated. Super Yummy, Super Friendly and Super good prices.....lots to order other than pizza too, 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special. The sell slices.   It's my go to pizza place now.  Prices are good. Pizza is good. Service is good.  What more do you want.   So tired of chain delvery pizza.  Good pizza with a mom and pop feal.  Place gets packed at night.   I recommend it. Kinda place makes you feal like a regular the first time your there.    They also have a small patio."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to Brooklyn V's Pizza. It was so good the first time that we had to bring our son and his girlfriend back for his birthday dinner! Desiree was absolutely awesome! Even though we had difficult orders.  We will most definitely come back and we highly recommend this fantastic place. They make you feel like family!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here after getting my nails done. I wish I would have tried this place sooner. Not only was the customer service fantastic, the food is amazing! I got an anti-pasto salad, the ingredients are fresh and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Just had pizza from the new Queen Creek location. I'm a pizza snob from New York and this is by far the closest I've had to NY pizza in AZ. Blows all the rest out of the water."}
{"text":"Third time's a charm... I mean that with much elation!!!So...we are here when it first opened, it used to be occupied by a pizza place that we ate at really for no reason other that it was close. We were pleasantly surprised by the food choices, we tried a couple of things one of which was the fettuccini Alfredo. I tend to judge an Italian restaurant by its fettuccini. We weren't blown away...the owner did however let us try his Zeppoli he was testing it to see if he wanted to add it to the menu and it was amazing..Shame I never saw it get added to the menu. Try again....we tried it again I got some food to go, again the food was good but not great. I got it to go and Italian food isn't great to go, so I kinda had that one coming. Third try...BLOWN AWAY!!! We had the garlic knots, always a good choice. The eggplant rollatini(fried eggplant rolled and stuffed with ricotta and covered with marinara...yeah it's as amazing as it sounds) and you guessed it fettuccini Alfredo with sausage. And it was glorious!! I couldn't be happier with the fact that we tried again. The food was amazing and Kerry our server was fantastic!! This place is a gem. The chef is truly amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic!!  Best New York pizza in Arizona!  Brooklyn v is a nice quite place for family and very delicious!!  Staff is wonderful!!  Great pizza place!!  Will be visiting again!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. I may have caught them on an off day I feel like it's probably better if you don't hit them at 3 PM on a Monday afternoon for a couple slices.  There was not much sauce and it was a tiny bit dry. The girl was very friendly and so was the owner. The crust tasted fantastic so I think that this place will probably be a hit for me and I will be back again to try some pasta dishes."}
{"text":"Really glad I read the reviews on the buffalo chicken pizza and ordered it because that was delicious! Two pizzas and a 6 piece garlic knots was really quite expensive to have delivered though. Otherwise I'd give it a full 5. Really tasty food though!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place and am almost here everyday. I recommend everyone to come blow your tastebuds away."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place for lunch and found a gem. Not only did I have a great experience, but the food was amazing too. Bob and Desiree are the sweetest people and helped me custom my lunch order. A very pleasant and clean environment. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went here because we wanted to try someplace new. We started with the garlic knots everyone raves about. And six honey BBQ wings. We each got salads with our dinners. Caesar for him, house salad for me. Chicken fettuccine Alfredo for him. Same for me but added mushrooms and broccoli.  Service was okay, could be better.  Food was tasty. The knots were room temp. But the Marinara it came with was hot and tasty. Wings had too much sauce causing them to get soggy fast. Next thing we know we had our salads and entrees quickly followed. So at one point we had our wings, salads, and entrees all on the table. Wish it was timed better.  As for our entrees. They seemed to be made by two different people. My husband's Alfredo was thick and cheesy. Mine was just creamy. It could have been because I added mushrooms and broccoli. Not sure.  But overall, everything was tasty. I liked his Caesar salad a lot better than the house salad. Plenty of leftovers to enjoy tomorrow.  Next time we will have to try the pizza. We saw several pizzas go out for take out."}
{"text":"So I always love this place and they had the best pizza..but sad to say no more..it is still ok/meh..but no longer reminds me of an authentic Brooklyn pizza slice ..also if I could rate just the pizza that I ate today..it was 2.5 stars for Brooklyn authenticity and yukky cheese that was like paper thin when you pulled on it not like that thick oil dropping kind of cheese that all New York pizzas have when cooked... hardly any sauce, cheese is not the same at all.. I don't believe its whole milk anymore it doesn't melt/ cook the same  and not gooey and the crust is so light colored even when cooked...no longer the same..I will still go for other things..and hope they didn't change those recipes and specific ingredients...but not pizza anymore..this makes me sad...on another note love the staff they are nice helpful and friendly!!! If they go back to old pizza ingredients and recipes...then they would be #1 again ..."}
{"text":"We had some amazingly fresh bruschetta here as well as some very richly flavored lasagna, garlic knots and cannolis. We had excellent service and our server was very attentive. Additionally she and the other staff were so passionate about their food and the restaurant that it was contagious. We were truly blown away by this place! The  food beat out some of the street crap I had in Rome over the summer!"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars but couldn't post a comment if I did.  Pizza tastes good but service was terrible.  I  online for delivery but wasn't informed of a 45-60 minute delivery time until after the order was completed.  I immediately called and asked if I could pick the pizza up sooner than the delivery time.  They said ok it would be 20-30 minutes and they would change my order to pick up and refund the tip and delivery fee.  When I got there to pick up the pizza, they couldn't find it and realized that they sent it out to be delivered.  Instead of making a new pizza, they called the delivery guy and told them to return with the pizza.  So I had to wait until the pizza came back.  They ignored me the entire time I was waiting.  Management avoided me, no offer of a drink or really anything.  Pizza was cold. Very disappointed in my experience.  A little acknowledgement of their mistake, offering something for my trouble could have turned the situation around.  Plenty of other pizza places out there.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We decided to try Brooklyn Vs after recommendations from a local neighborhood site and yelp reviews.  We were not disappointed! Desiree greeted us and very friendly. She recommended some of their dishes that we might enjoy.  We started with their brushetta..perfection! Fresh toasted Italian bread topped with tomatoes, onions, fresh basil and a balsamic glaze. One of the best by far we have had out here in AZ hands down.  We are huge meatball lovers we ordered a side of theirs..also delicious in their homemade sauce.  Desiree brought us an order of their garlic knots to try since they also come highly recommended from yelp. Warm, fresh garlic bread with parm cheese hint of fresh basil and their homemade marina! Yum Next came a 18 inch cheese pizza...again one of the best we have had out here..cheesy and the crust was absolutely delicious..crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside! I also tried a few bites of their Margherita fresh mozarella, cherry tomatoes and fresh basil and that also didn't disappoint! A slice of the snickers pie to share for dessert! We sampled so many things on our first trip A++ we will be back for sure and next time looking forward to try their dinners! Yum!"}
{"text":"As a former Staten Islander I was thrilled to learn of Brooklyn V's. I used to go to Vito's pizzeria in my home town when I was a kid and was pleasantly surprised to find out he is out here making the same great pies that I grew up on.  Vito, his staff and food are top notch. If you want to know what authentic New York style pizza is, you've found it.  I am now a regular and it took 10 years living in Az to find my pizza spot! Thanks Vito!"}
{"text":"Seriously!!! I mean this place got 4.5 stars ! Worst pizza i ever tried , nothing special at all , i ordered for home delivery and got my order after 75 minutes cold , the the pizza tastes horrible . First time and never again"}
{"text":"I've been to this place before with friends and have yet to have bad service or bad pizza. Simply put, the pizza and service are great and the prices make this place a great bang for your buck. I've also had the Stromboli and I'll be honest, I died and went to heaven!!"}
{"text":"I arrived at this establishment on a Friday around 7:30pm. Overall I was pretty impressed with the food, in which me and a group had ordered a large white pizza and garlic knots. The pizza was excellent and is comparable to somewhere such as Gilbert Pizza. However, the down side to this restaurant is the service. Every time I have made a visit here I have waited quite a bit of time to receive r any service. Expect to wait and plan your time accordingly, inside is a little cramped but this place makes you feel at home."}
{"text":"First off we had the garlic knots. They were SO DAMN GOOD. Perfect balance of crispy outside with soft gooey insides and not overly garlic'd. The sauce was made fresh in house and had great flavor. We ordered 12 - 6 would be enough for most people as they are larger than I expected them to be. None survived though :)  Excellent pizza. Tried the margherita and was very impressed. The basil was super fresh, as were the tomatoes and it had clumps of gooey real mozzarella. The crust was perfect. If you like NY pizza this is the closest I've found it in AZ. The pepperoni was also very good. Not too greasy with nice flavor. Also, you can order by the slice and it still comes fresh so that was great for lunch.  For dessert the Snickers pie was amazing. It was not too sweet which is often something I dislike in those types of pie.   The owner, Vito, came over and chatted with us for a bit which was a nice touch and our server Nadine was super friendly and attentive. Dining room and restrooms were very clean. We will definitely be back to try other things off the menu. Hands down crushes Casanova Bros."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant tucked away, I had no idea it even existed until I read reviews on tripadvisor. It is a nice lil corner restaurant with indirect lighting and tv's turned to the sports section. We had the bruschetta as an appetizer, it was tasty, a lil different since it had chopped onions on it but it sure was messy. The balsamic got on my shirt and I put the extra seasoned tomatoes in with my pasta.  Seems like a nice place for many different customers to enjoy. I think they could use more walking room since the traffic patterns make you feel cramped. The food was delicious and the waiter was friendly, she did take a lil while to refill our drinks but for the most part a good experience."}
{"text":"Service is great! We walked in got seated right away and ordered drinks. Very personal pizza hall. Pizza is delish..they have kick ass crust and I believe a homemade sausage that was mild and tastes yummy. Usually never order sausage and we've had it 3 times. Service was great, checked on us, filled drinks promply. Very enjoyable dinner on a tired Friday night.Ty"}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious! Pizza places are a dime a dozen and most are average and forgettable. This place is amazing (& they deliver which is an added bonus!). We love Brooklyn v's and eat here often!!"}
{"text":"We made our first visit and had lasagna, fettuccini and an antipasto. All were good tasting with generous portions. The antipasto was the best of the three. Service is also good. We'll try the pizza with an open mind despite having eaten pizza in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Was enjoying a night of swimming in the 100+ degree weather and wanted something  good, quick and delivered to our door.  Brooklyn V's fit the bill! Food was delivered under the estimated time and was piping hot. We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, chicken stromboli and honey bbq wings and all were amazing!  Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place since Sanfratello's across the street was closed. We ordered their lasagna, bread sticks and Caesar salad. Lasagna came in a round foil package and when we opened it, it was soup. I could pour it out. No texture in anything. It all tasted the same and had no firmness. Salad was good. Does anyone in the east valley make good lasagna? The cannoli's were good"}
{"text":"It's a great pizza place if you want a break from the usual chain places.  The garlic knots are very good."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. Family friendly..cute environment with wine and beer on draft."}
{"text":"This is the real deal! No other way to put it. If I had an Italian grandmother and she made strombolis with fresh marinara this is what it woukd look and taste like. This joint is definitely givin my other favorite pizza joints a run for its money. I had a slice of the bianco with the seasoned ricotta. Next time I woukd ask to add some fresh garlic but the crust was impressive and the flavor was good so I didn't mess with it. True new York size slice generous mozzarella and ricotta. I was stuffed with just the one slice but had to eat some stromboli. The ingredients were simple pepperoni meatball sausage but they were seasoned right buttery crust.... Loved it beginning to end I'll be back"}
{"text":"I agree with people who say this is the best New York Pizza that can be found in Arizona. I'm glad I don't live closer because I would be there two or three times a week. The pizza is outstanding. The garlic rolls are the best I have had outside of New York. Everything I tried was fresh and the cannoli were especially delicious. The service was extremely friendly and you have to be a little patient, but you're getting quality with your wait. Best pizza I have found in 23 years of living in Arizona other than Pizzeria Bianco, but that is more Italian style than New York style."}
{"text":"We love Brooklyn V's and are so happy they opened a Queen Creek location! They have the best pizza and service!"}
{"text":"We were craving NY pizza and decided to jump on Yelp and see what was close by. In the mood to try something new,  this place did not disappoint. We started with a caesar salad. The dressing was tangy and the slices of fresh cheese finished it off nicely. We ordered the basil pesto chicken pizza. Yummy!  It was a nice touch for the chef-owner to stop by our table and ask us how everything was. Our server was Anna and she was a sweetheart. They are both from New York. We will be back."}
{"text":"While the food is good, I have just been stiffed for the third time on my take-out order.  I have to drive back there to pick it up, and never once have they offered to take it off the bill, etc.  Yeah, my fault for not checking the order.  Won't happen again."}
{"text":"The Proper Care and Feeding of Italian Eaters. It's been awhile since I \"yelped\" this joint!  So, I think it's about time for an update.. Vito.. Seriously the nicest pizza owner I know (and YES, I know a few!) !  More than a few times, he's come out and greeted the patrons of his establishment checking on us, making sure we've been taken care of and fed properly! The food is amazing.. my favorites are still White Eggplant Pizza.. it is to die for delish!  The other sOOper nummie is the lasagna!  But most importantly, you cannot leave this establishment without having some Cannoli! Molto Bene! Oh and Anna, she's still our #1 reason for dining in!  LOVE her!"}
{"text":"Plain and simple....I've had better.  I expected a true ma & pa restaurant who took the time and love to cook their sauces and choose the best ingredients.  The food lacked seasoning and the sauces were watered down and did not have the richness that is expected.  Lots of shortcuts taken to produce quick sub par food.  It was worth the try but I will not be going back especially when there are several other establishments near by that have proven to really pay attention to bold, thick, rich flavors in their sauces and do not take shortcuts."}
{"text":"Four stars for the pizza.  Very good crust.  Tasty toppings.  Two stars for the prices.  Its priced about 5 more than similar places in the area."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become my favorite local joint to get food! I love the food and the chance to get out of my house and sit down somewhere else with TV, a drink, and Italian food.   My favorite dishes are the Chicken Marsala and the chicken and mozzarella (add mushrooms) calzone. The garlic knot appetizers are addictive! They come with a side of homemade marinara and are to die for. The bruschetta is pretty good. The chicken parm here is also very well done.   Though I haven't tried it yet, their pizza seems to be very popular.   The service is usually pretty good. Anna is the best!!   Also, they deliver!!  They have TVs, booths, tables, and outside seating. The tables in the middle can accommodate small groups."}
{"text":"There are places that sell pizza and places that sell a pizza like substance (Pizza Hut, Domino's, etc).  I would put Brooklyn V's in the category that sell pizza.  Started off with the garlic knots.  They were very good and the marinara sauce that was served with it was good also.  Ordered the 14\" white pizza and added pepperoni, onion and garlic.  The crust on the pizza was light and crunchy...so that was a good thing.  The pizza itself was a tad soupy but good never the less.  As it turned out, after the garlic knots (small order) the pizza was more than enough for two with leftovers to go home.  From a price perspective the price was a tad high when compared to a place that sells pizza like substance  On the other hand it was competitive with places that sell pizza.  So if price versus quality is an issue than a place that sells pizza like substance may be more in order."}
{"text":"Pizza is good we had it delivered and arrived fast and was still hot. Also ordered a piece of cheesecake for $5. Their pic on the menu makes you believe that you are getting a big piece of cheese cake when what you actually get is about 3in long by 1in wide. They should call it mini cheese cake.  That was not work the money."}
{"text":"I can't bring myself to give three stars to a local business, so I give four. But, the pizza here is really a 2-3 star pizza -- really bland, 'runny' cheese, lack of garlic; crust is okay; toppings seemed fresh. With really authentic NY and Chicago pizza joints in Gilbert, you can give this place a pass unless you shopped your heart out at Goodwill and just need calories fast."}
