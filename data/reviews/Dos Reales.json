{"text":"I really like this place because they have such generous portions for food at such a great price. As a poor college student, this is a great place to get dinner with friends without breaking the bank. Also, their margaritas are delicious!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a Dos or Die kind of Mexican food eater.  However, after years of eating here I still like it, but it could use some more variety.  Everything you order is some combination of the same ingredients:  chopped steak or chicken, ground beef, rice and beans, lettuce, cheese, and sometimes guacamole and sour cream.  It's good, but it can be redundant.  The chips are horrible, but the salsa has a good \"kick\" to it.  

My favorite has to be the fajita quesadilla.  I usually order it with shrimp and steak, and it is delicious.  If you like peppers and want a gigantic portion of food that you probably won't finish, then this is the meal for you.  Oh, and if you want fried ice cream be prepared to share--it comes in a whopping portion with a huge topping of whipped cream.  

Another bonus is that it is kid-friendly.  The waiters are good with children and make them feel welcome.  The food is also a hit with the kids."}
{"text":"This review is a few years old, I'm afraid.

When we lived in Champaign this was our favorite Mexican restaurant.  The wait staff was pretty cheerful every time we came and the food always came out fast, hot, and plentiful.  I LOVED this nacho dish thing that used to come out covered in lettuce.  Someone mentioned the white cheese sauce in another review and that was what I loved.  So addictively yummy.  It might have been the Guadalajara Special, but whatever it was I used to think it was funny having to find the food by excavating the lettuce.  That was back when I could get an alcoholic drink with my meal and not endanger my spawn, of course.

Husband used to get the chicken fajitas.  Huge mound of chicken.  Like.. half a chicken or something, along with all the expected veg, etc.  

I've lived in California (North and South) and Texas and I still recommend this place.  Yes, I've been to really authentic places.  I don't care, maybe my palate is polluted by Tex-Mex, but I still loved my favorite dishes at Dos Reales.  To be fair, I don't know about any menu items I haven't tried.  DOS Reales I miss you!"}
{"text":"It might be nostalgia talking, but I love Dos Reales. Great Mexican food, friendly service, and reasonable prices. Highly recommended if you're in the area.

I recommend their Quesadillas."}
{"text":"No place I'd rather go with a big group of friends to celebrate a birthday with margaritas and excessive amounts of food."}
{"text":"While visiting Ryan he took me her since he knows i could eat mexican food every single day. It was packed when we came in but suprisingly we only had a five minute wait. The waiter immediatley came over and asked us if we would like something to drink, and came back as soon as we put our menus down to take our order. We were by no means rushed- you can tell they just know how to run a restaurant and run it extremely well.
Their salsa is delicious and they are generous with their chips- but the best part is the prices, holy cow are they reasonable. Ryan got a burrito bigger than my dog and it was only $7.95! I got the flautas and they were deep fried to perfection while the chicken was moist and delicious inside. While eating the lemon fell off my cup and onto the floor and the next second the waiter brought me over a plate of lemon slices- how impressive!!
The portions are enormous, but incredibly delicious and extremely budget friendly. I wish we had room for dessert- I'll definitely try it next time."}
{"text":"I like Dos Reales.  As a vegan they have a few options, and this has gotten better since they added black beans.  My only complaint is that they are inconsistent.  I usually get the veggie burrito with black beans and no cheese.  Sometimes the mushrooms have this wonderful flavoring.  Other times they are flavorless.  The difference between the two is a good burrito or a mediocre one.  They offer great free chips/salsa.  They are *very* fast, especially at lunch.  Although they can be backed up then too."}
{"text":"Dirty bathrooms, bland, vaguely gross food (e.g,. a beef burrito is a flour tortilla with 3/4 cup of ground beef -- and nothing else -- doused in salsa). Cheap beer in dirty pitchers. Friendly, fast staff.  Very cheap, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Townie white midwesterner's idea of good Mexican food.  Total gringo food - if that;s what you want."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere , best Margarita and awesome food! I had a seafood enchilada with cheese sauce and it was really nice- 3 enchiladas  one of each -shrimp,crab,tilapia . Good service as well.
Not giving a 5 star because the restroom was not very clean"}
{"text":"Pros: Cheap, huge portions, friendly staff.

Cons: This is not the best C-U has to offer as far as Mexican food. 

What I ordered: First visit- enchiladas verdes (chicken) with a side of beans. The salsa verde was bland- notably lacking in onion, garlic, cilantro, and salt. The chicken was seasoned with a sweet and smoky tomato sauce... the smoke flavor overpowered the salsa verde, tortillas, cheese, and cream. They use sour cream, not Mexican crema, which was disappointing. The beans were lacking in flavor. I don't know if they were canned or if they were boiled in water without onion, garlic, etc. Second visit: steak tacos and rice. The tacos were so greasy- it was as if the meat was deep fried and then they poured two tablespoons of oil in the taco. I asked for a flour tortilla, expecting (hoping!) for a good flour tortilla, unfortunately it wasn't any better than the store-bought flour tortillas in the refrigerator section, having that unmistakable preservative taste. 

Bottom line: Probably fine if you just want nachos and margaritas and don't know good Mexican food...but head elsewhere for non-Americanized fare."}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome food. Cheap. Meat quality is very good compared to other Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in my life.

The service is top notch. Everyone treats you like a king. You get unlimited chips/salsa and waiters/waitresses are always eager to get you what you want.

The food is unbelievable. They give you so much food for the money, but it still tastes great! I would recommend the acapulco. It has steak, chicken, shrimp, a pork chimichanga, salsa, guac, chips, rice, and 3 tortillas. This is under $10!!

Highly recommended

Service: 10/10
Food : 10/10
Wait time: around 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"i think i finally found a decent mexican restaurant in c-u!  i went for lunch on a few occasions and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch specials.  i like that it's fast and the food comes out hot.  i've tried the guadalajara lunch special, which is my favorite.  their salsa is so delish!  they refill your drinks without having to ask.  oh, and their margaritas are yummy as well!  kind of difficult to pour if you get the pitcher, it spills everywhere, but other than that, it's ok.  i think i've tried almost every mexican restaurant in town and will only go back to dos reales.  although it's nothing compared to the mexican restaurants back home (l.a.)!!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing special. I got a quesadilla and, to be honest, I took half home and it tasted better the next day when I was hungover, so perhaps it is better for that. The staff was really friendly and the service was fast. It is a step up from fast food for sure."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group of people, for a friend's birthday dinner. Though I'm an omnivore, the vegetarian options were apparently pretty good, so we settled on Dos Reales over a few other options. The service was great, and the waiters were welcoming. 

I ordered a carnitas dinner, which provided me with enough food for two meals. The pork was cooked to perfection, and the rest of the plate (beans, rice, lettuce, tomatoes) was pretty standard for Mexican food around here. I really enjoyed the sauce on the carnitas, which was the highlight of my meal. It could have come with a few more tortillas, though; the dish only came with three, which was definitely not enough for this huge meal. 

As much as I enjoyed the food, you have to remember that you're eating at a Mexican restaurant a few blocks away from the highway in central Illinois. The location and the atmosphere, even though the restaurant looks decently clean and well-kept, is still a little bit off, and I'm reluctant to give it a fifth star, as much as I enjoyed the food and the service."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurant I have ever tried. This restaurant gets full marks on food taste and ambiance.

I have been to this restaurant on multiple occasions including weekends and I always found ample space to park car and seating arrangement.

Food serve is really delicious and it does not take more than 10 mins from the order to getting the plate on the table.

I recently moved to california and this is one restaurant I am going to miss here."}
{"text":"Dos Reales is, hands-down, the best Mexican restaurant in the Champaign-Urbana area. The service is UNBELIEVABLY fast, they're totally willing to customize your dishes, and their white queso sauce is to die for. 

Ask for a bowl of white queso with your tortilla chips, you won't regret it! Incredible salsa as well, tastes like it's homemade. And won't break your wallet at all!"}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today. Service was really fast...food was SUPER!  For my girlfriend and I, our bill was $16. We both left happy and full."}
{"text":"Went to Dos Reales for an early dinner and ordered the vegetarian quesadilla. The quesadilla was enormous topped with their house queso and was served with mexican rice, and guacamole salad. The quesadilla itself was very flavorful the veggies inside were nicely seasoned and sautéed. The sides were a nice pairing with the main dish, the mexican rice was savoury and the guacamole was just right. 

By the time we were leaving the place was packed. So I recommend avoiding the peak hours. 

Regardless, I had an incredible authentic mexican meal, highly suggest giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan - the food was greasy and overpriced.  

I did go back again and ordered the seafood salad, which turned out to be healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"Um, there's no place like this place - anywhere.  Partly due to nostaligia and partly due to the sheer brilliance of a super-fast Mexican joint with super-friendly servers (HI FREDDY!!! --our fave) and super deliciously satisfying hangover (or non hangover food), with excellently strong margaritas, in walking distance from campus....oh my I could go on and on and on and on.

I miss you, Dos.  You can never be replaced in my heart.

Mmm cheese enchiladas, beans, and rice.  And.  A big-ass margarita.  If it's your birthday, they give you the special birthday sombrero and a treat.  And often, a side cup with some extra tequila.  Which....is not high quality.  But perfect for Chambana.  Pretty freakin awesome place."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have not had good food on any of those occasions.  The food is always covered in sauce and very bland.  It definitely feels like a place that just keeps their food warm in the back or something and trots it out.  

It's never gross out bad, but I always leave wishing we had gone somewhere else.  I wouldn't eat here again.  It always surprises me how much people like this place and flock to it."}
{"text":"There are only two Mexican restaurant's I will patron...... DOS is very first choice always. Good service from very friendly professional wait staff as well as great food. Never a wait ..... timing is everything. This is a very popular place at meal times. You are never rushed out to \"turn\" a table. In 10 years never a bad experience. The lunch take out very timely as well.  Never experienced anything like it anywhere else in CU."}
{"text":"My. favorite. Mexican. restaurant EVER! Okay, so maybe part of it has to do with the nostalgia of eating here while I was in college, but really. It's THAT good! Although I graduated from UIUC 6 years ago (omg has it really been that long?) I find myself finding excuses to make the 3 hour drive down there just to eat the amazing sizzling fajitas. I'm not saying it's the most authentic place, but cheap, great food that comes out FAST is good enough for me. The margaritas are also very yummy :)

This is also the best location. I was SO excited about finding out about a Dos Reales in Rockford, IL... but EH. I also heard the one on University closed down so this is the only place to go.

Dos Reales, I will make my annual trip to see you VERY SOON!!"}
{"text":"Good, consistent, and cheap! This is one of our favorite places to go in Champaign. A sit down meal for two with an appetizer is usually less than $20. Endless chips and two kinds of salsa. The carry-out orders come with lots of free chips and salsa too. If you're not starving, consider the a la carte options - you will be amazed how cheap your meal is! If you ARE starving, they have combo deals that come on two loaded plates. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is always packed. That's an indication that the food is good.  There aren't a whole lot of places to get authentic good Mexican food in Champaign, however, this was alright.  The food was good, I'd eat there again, but it's nothing to make me crave it like I have with other Mexican places out of state.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it because I didn't think it was anything special. Just good, standard mexican food."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food (for Champaign). I love the food here, although definitely ask them to lay off the salt (everytime I eat there it is pretty salty but I don't like salt at all). The margaritas are also excellent- go with friends and get them by the pitcher (especially the mango)!"}
{"text":"So very disappointed in most of the reviews of Dos.  Yes, it is good, but they are so intent on getting the patrons in and out as quickly as possible that it really takes the enjoyment out of the whole experience for me.  If I want fast Mexican food, I'll go to some corporate dump thank-you-very-much.  El Toro is a step up, but the true gem of C-U Mexican cuisine is Fiesta Cafe.  The margaritas are outstanding, the fajitas large enough for me to split with my husband (that's saying something for us) and the waitstaff actually remembers their regulars. Te amo, Fiesta Cafe!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise finding Dos Reales in Champaign Illinois. Not only was the food and price family friendly, but the service was great, as well. Easy parking with plenty of spaces to accommodate the crowd of people on a Saturday night. Not long of a wait to be seated without calling ahead. Will look forward to another visit."}
{"text":"I'm from the Bay Area in California, so there are no shortage of GOOD taquerias in our area. This place did not even come close.

I had a fajita quesadilla with chicken I believe, which was pretty disappointing. It tasted like they just used Kraft Singles american cheese in the quesadilla, which is definitely NOT the right kind of cheese for this sort of thing. The texture of the quesadilla just left a dry feeling in my mouth. The saving grace of this place is that they have really good tortilla chips that come with your meal, and the salsa was okay. Sorry to say, but I would probably not come back here again."}
{"text":"We stopped here for something different on our way home. The food and service are good, but not great. We had the fajita burrito and fajita quesadilla. Service was a bit slow, but probably because we got here in the middle of the lunch rush. It's a place we would go back to in a pinch to avoid fast food."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Dos Reales. The waitstaff is very attentive and friendly, and the food is delicious and not too pricey. Everything is good here; I specifically like the Burrito Fajita (with steak) yum!"}
{"text":"i always give every restaurant a second chance, but after last night's second chance with dos reales, i have to say i agree on so many points with the rest of the posters--why the eff do people rave about this place?

the food is seriously bland, and it's almost like everything on the menu is just a version of something else on the menu. so there's really not many options, even though the menu looks huge. 

good points are that it's cheap, and that the first time i went, the margarita was strong as hell (not so the second time--i had two and wasn't even buzzed). the cheese dip is good, and the staff is always friendly. 

even so, though, none of these make up for the quality of the food. sorry. i really wanted to like you, dos reales, but it jut ain't happenin'."}
{"text":"Dos Reales offers tasty non-authentic Mexican food. I get the Enchiladas Supremas combo every time. I don't know whether the cheesy enchilada sauce is real cheese or not, but it tastes delicious.

At Dos Reales, you get your food within six minutes, the portions are large and consistent, and the food prices are ridiculously cheap. Dos Reales is NOT romantic, doesn't offer authentic Mexican food, and probably uses cheap ingredients. For me, that is perfect, because I don't go there on dates, I like non-authentic Mexican food, and I don't expect high quality for $7.50. That said, I always enjoy my meal.

Among the majority of mediocre restaurants located in the UIUC campus area, Dos Reales stands out as being great."}
{"text":"I've been here once but I've felt like I've ate here 100 times. You can tell instantly this is a fake Mexican-style restaurant where people who have little exposure to proper Mexican food go to drink margaritas. I truly believe nothing on my plate was homemade. I ordered a Burrito Green Chile that had \"homemade\" green chile sauce. With a quick glance you can tell its straight from a can. 

Our food was out in 5 minutes. This place is not a restaurant, its a cafeteria. 

Food straight from an assembly line of heated, canned garbage."}
{"text":"Pros: Really cheap, lots of food, strong margaritas 

Cons: Average Mexican food, ran out of ice cream 

Ordered the enchiladas supremas, which were tasty and came out in under 15 minutes. That's OK because I needed time do down the margarita. The food was OK and the drink was strong. For dessert we wanted fried ice cream, but they ran out of ice cream! WHAT! Otherwise it was a good experience. 

In a close call I think I like Toro better, which is across town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is super fast, the food is excellent, the prices are reasonable. The Nachos Pollo Asado is perfect! The sweet tea is the best around!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The portion sizes are big, so you are always full when you eat. It is hard for me to rate Mexican places because I don't go to them all that often. I wouldn't say its special, but it is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Ohh Dos, how I miss thee.

I have yet to find a comparable place in Chicago. Good, inexpensive food (WTF is IN that delicious cheesy goo? It's amazing!), and strong, inexpensive, not-to-sugary, tart, delicious margaritas by the pitcher.

It's not exactly fancy cuisine, but I think we're all ok with that.

Dos, we will continue to visit you each and every time we are in Champaign."}
{"text":"I would recommend the chicken chimichangas and mango margaritas. Been going here for more than 15 years and the food has remained delicious! Classic tacos on corn tortillas with steak or shrimp, cheese and cilantro are also delicious. My friends love the Acapulco and the fajita quesadilla."}
{"text":"Absolutly the BEST mexican resturant in town!  Dos Reales is my favorite go to place when Im looking for somthing tasty to eat. It is fast, cheap, and above all tastes great. The service is awesome and they have plenty of seating. My favorite dish is the Chicken Fajita Quasidila. That with there amazing fresh chips and salsa make the perfict meal. 

If you havent been to Dos Reales, you need to! Its by far my favorite resturant in Champaign. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Champaign/Urbana. A huge menu with tons of choices.  Chips and salsa before your meal (I usually polish off at least one basket) and cheap margarita specials.  The service is unbelievable.  Food is prepared quickly and the wait staff is very polite and helpful.  I've probably ordered half the items on the menu and have never been disappointed.  While sometimes there is a wait on Friday/Saturday night, I have never waited longer then 20 or 30 minutes to get seated.  I bring all of my friends from out of town here and they all LOVE it.  I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"cheap,delicious, huge portion.
can't believe i wasted so much money on chipotle before. 
recommend: canitas dinner, cheese steak burrito."}
{"text":"I will never understand people's inclination toward this restaurant. This is not Mexican food. It's an insult. Even as tex mex masquerading as mexican food, the quality is just not there. Come here if you're into canned refried beans, instant rice, with that fake 'mexican' blend shredded cheese on top of everything. Yo digo que asco."}
{"text":"Great margaritas. Many menu options. Cheese nachos are the bomb! Their fried ice cream is served in a huge sundae bowl covered with whipped creme and chocolate. The fried ice cream is easily something that could be split between multiple people and would be a great to split between a date or spouse."}
{"text":"Fantastic price, good service and food, but the food is less authentic-tasting than some of the other Mexican restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Dos Reales is hands down the best Mexican restaurant that I have ever been to. 

First, the food is great. Anything you get on the menu is amazing from their burritos, tostadas, steak dishes, veggie dishes, you name it. Furthermore, they come in huge portions with most dishes ranging in the $6-11 area for lunch and dinner. If you want a food coma for cheap, Dos Reales is simply the place to go. 

Second, the waiters are great. They are friendly and bring the food out fast. Plus, they come to your table about every 10 minutes to check if everything is ok. This is nice when you actually need something, but gets annoying when you don't. I appreciate their concern though, which is why I like them. :)

Third, free chips with salsa before your meal!!!!!"}
{"text":"The BEST Authentic Mexican Restaurant I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Of all the mexican places I have been to, this one is really only a 3 start place. Food was lacking flavor. The mild salsa was like eating straight tomatoes sauce and the not was very very mild. The enchilada sauce was also bland and very mild. My son had a kids meal and that was honestly better than my food. I can't say I'll ever go back. There are much cleaner, friendlier and tastier places in town."}
{"text":"I visited this Restaurant on my recent trip down memory lane while visiting my Alma Mater. My friends and I ate here whenever we craved good Mexican food. The best part is if you are a vegetarian they have 6 combinations listed out for you. Now the nachos and salsa still did the trick but the rest of the food can only be called ok though my kids liked the Mexican Mac and cheese. The place also looked in need of some upgrades. Sometimes you need to let memories be memories - but since I already touched this one I will try again and order something different the next time I get a chance to be in the CU area."}
{"text":"Dos Reales is a good place for decent Mexican food. The prices are in line with what you'd expect. They have a wide variety, and they are walkable from campus.

I go regularly for lunch and always get the fajitas or fajita salad. There's always plenty of leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered take out last night; the guy on the phone rushed my order & was talking to someone in the background where he had to ask me to repeat myself at least 6 times. He told me it would be done in about 10 minutes. We show up at the restaurant 20 minutes later to pick it up, and its still not done. We wait ANOTHER 25 minutes for them to finish our food. Whats the point of take out then? Service = Horrible. & the food was just as bad. I ordered the Acupulco, that was \"okay\". We ordered three steak tacos with corn torillas and all toppings on there; it came with flour tortillas and non of the toppings we asked for. The steak was dry and tasted nasty. The rice, tasted nasty. The salsa, tasted like the salsa taco bell gives you with their taco salads. Just no.....& the food came out to $27.50??? Not to mention the creepy vibe I got from there by the staff. Yeah, never going there again. Just head over to Maize instead."}
{"text":"dos reales is a reason for living.  never have i ever found such great food, served so quickly, by such friendly wait staff.  dos is everything i could have hoped and more.  

if you go there and dont order the cheese dip, you are out of your mind.

best two things on the menu:
burrito bravo
steak enchiladas (have them put some of the cheese sauce on them in addition to the enchilada sauce)
but honestly, go with the enchiladas.

bring lots of friends, drink lots of margaritas, and go often!  

please take note of the typos and other quirks in the menu - very smile-worthy :)"}
{"text":"Standard divey Mexican food.  Tasty and quick.  There's nothing special about anything on the menu, so far as I can tell, but it all tastes good, and it's an immense amount of food for not an immense amount of money. I forsee going back during future LEEP weekends."}
{"text":"if you are looking for the best place to get lit on a dime... this is it.

seriously.  the margaritas are great.  you can get a whole pitcher for $16.  they are strong and flavorful, and if you by chance you get a pitcher and think it's not up to par, the waiters will take it back and make another.  in fact, they do it cheerfully.  which brings me to service...

i have never had a crappy waiter at this place.  not once.  i never had a night i waited unreasonably for food, to get a drink refilled, for a check, or to make sure i was enjoying my meal.  super, super service. which brings me to the food....

it's okay.  i've had great mexican food, and it's not great mexican food.  BUT... if you drink enough.... it IS great mexican.  (it's passable.)

bottom line.  go there to drink, firstly.  enjoy the food, secondary to the drinking.  get great service while you do that."}
{"text":"Good food. Decent prices. Fast & friendly service. Definitely my family's go-to for mexican food in Champaign-Urbana area!"}
{"text":"This is consistently pretty good stuff.  Nice bright space, good servers, and acceptably good food.  I actually like the Milanesa, thin breaded meat that you can put in tortillas with toppings, the best of anything I have had there.  CAVEAT:  The location on University is darker, seems to have poorer service, and lesser food than the one on Prospect.  Maybe they used that as a training location!"}
{"text":"Overall, Dos Reales had decent food, but it seemed very \"Americanized.\" I'm not sure whether I should hold that against them or not though because maybe that's what gets them good business, but I wouldn't say it's anything unique or special. I did really like their horchata though; very delicious!  The prices aren't too bad either. The employees were a bit rude though when we went. I was with one other person and they brought our food out ten minutes apart. Also when they brought it out to us, they threw it on a table in a hurry and ran off. One thing that the staff were very kind about though was not kicking us out. The person I was with and I ended getting caught up in a conversation and accidentally stayed in the restaurant about 20 minutes after closing. The staff saw we were engaged in a conversation and didn't bother us. After we realized that we stayed after hours, we promptly left. I might come back here and give it another try because the parts of my first experience that I didn't like may have just been unique to that visit and may not be reflective of a typical visit to Dos Reales."}
{"text":"This place shouldn't be as popular as it is. I got a enchilada, taco, and chulupa combo and couldn't tell the difference between the three items, they all looked the same. The sauces they use for their food was bland. As a Latino, I enjoy authentic food and good Tex-mex food but this food didn't fit into either category. This place will overcharge for a taco. Yes, their burritos are huge but any Mexican restaurant has huge burritos. I was confused on their decor. It looks as if three people decorated at the same time. Champaign has so many Mexican restaurant options, that it's not worth trying this one. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service everytime.  Solid food and always worth the visit.  Everything I have ordered has always been great. Make sure to visit this place!"}
{"text":"Standard fare Mexican place, nothing to write home about. They do bring you free salsa and chips but the flour tortillas are outrageously expensive considering many place give you them for free or for a low cost. Food otherwise reasonably priced. Huaraches is so far my favourite Mexican place in town."}
{"text":"It's not the best Mexican ever, but its the best in Champaign. Usually pretty easy to get a table w/out much wait and they have a big parking lot. Loved it while i was at school, and miss it now. Still talked about by my alum friends, and a must-stop during visits to campus."}
{"text":"Dos Reales definitely has a tough competition in the Urbana-Champaign area for Mexican food. It offers a few good things that make it more enjoyable than other two good places. First they have ample parking around the place. They have ample seating. Chips and salsa is complimentary and very good. Most of the staff does not understand complex English so keep it simple when ordering. 

We felt like the waiter was looking for the table as he was guiding us to the table, a little disorganized but efficient because he found one at the end! It is a large place so very good for groups. We had vegetarian plates option A and I. I enjoyed my option I a lot. They had done a great job with Fajita vegetables and making a quesadilla from it. I am usually disappointed in Fajita vegetables but this one was uniquely good experience for me. Overall food is not as great as other two Mexican places but overall dining experience is better, clean and efficient. 

Certainly a very good option for Mexican food, especially ambiance, parking and service are the things that matter to you!!"}
{"text":"Dear Dos, 

Without you I am not a complete person. Even though I never went to Illinois I found myself making reasons to drive down there just to indulge in your burrito bravo. Thank you for all you do! 

Love, 
Luke"}
{"text":"I told my brother to go to school here instead of some other unnamed Big Ten School's on the sole purpose that when I visit him I can come back and get a burrito bravo.  I didn't go to U of I, I went to the much more rowdy Big Ten School just outside of Chicago, but when I would visit friends I would eat here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I think I got in a fight once, because someone we were with didn't want to eat there.  Anyways if you're a student at U of I and you haven't been there then shame on you!"}
{"text":"One of the most difficult things about moving downstate was not having good taqueria food - and then I noticed my friend writing Facebook status updates about how he was having \"Dos for dinner\" or \"Dos delivers!\" 

It took me several months of building anticipation to finally drive myself to Dos to order a shrimp fajita salad to go. I swear that this salad could cure world hunger! The thing is HUGE, tasty, and came with chips and salsa! My salad only cost a little bit over $10 with tax and was prepared in under 15 minutes. Quite impressive!

I dined here for the first time with my boyfriend and friend, and was equally impressed with the quick table and food service. We had lunch specials that cost well-below $8 with tax and were so filling. The restaurant's ambiance is nice and great for groups. 

I've even brought my parents here and they really enjoy it to the point where when they visit, it's likely for us to order takeout from here. 

My only caveat is that the food can be incredibly rich."}
{"text":"This has become a weekly staple for us, everything on the menu is awesome and super quick. The lines may be long, but they move you through quickly and once seated all the stress stops. Pitchers of XX for $6, meals all under $10, and the best salsa and chips in town. The only thing I would suggest straying from would be the nacho plates---soggy and light on cheese--just order a cheese dip and call it a day."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town. They're best dish is probably the chicken fajitas."}
{"text":"I think it's fair to say that the horchata here is fantastic. I still remember how smooth and creamy that drink was. Hard to believe such magic can happen with good ingredients and loving food preparation."}
{"text":"My husband's favorite mexican place ... probably on the continental US

The chicken creme is good and the burritos"}
{"text":"Everything probably came out of a can. I mean everything. Not horrible but definitely not worth the money. You'd be better off getting tacos from Burger King or jack in the box. There's so many better options for real Mexican food in the area. This place may be good for those who don't know any better or what Mexican food should taste like."}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican place I've been to in the Chambana area. It's good if you're in the mood for Mexican, but definitely not even close to the best Mexican restaurant I've been to as far as flavor/food goes. Ordered a margherita for my 21st and was not disappointed by the amount of alcohol in it though."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad. I got some sort of spicy enchiladas I think. My wife got chili rellenos. The enchiladas were good. My wife's weren't. They were mostly stuffed with cheese. My big gripe is the giant portion. I am someone who has trouble stopping. I appreciate when restaurants have sensible portions. 

I'd go back here to eat, but I want to try some of the more authentic places in town."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is so popular. The food is not very good and is over priced for this type of food. The wait staff was unfriendly. The decor is lacking. I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"No sé qué decir
Deseo era mejor
Pero I'll be back

(I tried Dos Reales with a friend the other night.  The atmosphere was pleasant enough, but I have mixed feelings about the food.  I ordered the chicken mole, with a side of chile relleno.  The mole was obviously straight out of a jar, which is never a good thing.  The chile relleno, however, was pretty good... certainly not the BEST that I've ever had, but also not the WORST either.  

Recommendation:  Give this place a try, but stay away from the mole!)"}
{"text":"Above-average Mexican food at a pretty good price. Servings are generous, service is quick, and the margaritas are great. It does get crowded, though, so avoid friday/saturday nights if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Salsa with the beginnings of a kick and waiters who actualmente habla espanol does NOT an 'authentic' Mexican restaurant make.  Now I know I'm from San Diego most recently and Los Angeles before that, so I might be a bit more predisposed toward better Mexican food, but this isn't it.

THe Chicken Milanesa was....meh.  The overall atmosphere was ....also meh.

So far, my search for good Mexican food continues in C-U."}
{"text":"Dos has an appeal that is hard to define. It's not gourmet and it's not an authentic cultural experience. It is pretty standard American-Mexican food with lots of white cheese and basic ingredients. And yet, somehow it's a cut above other places which follow that formula. I always come away feeling quite satisfied. You can't beat the value, especially for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Meh.

Or in Spanish: Que meh!

Seriously, I've now been to both Dos Reales, and while you can chat it up in Spanish with the sweet staff that work there, and you can enjoy a decent margarita, this is Midwestern pseudoMexican food at its blandest and least inspired.  And fried and cheese-dunked.  Next."}
{"text":"This by far is the worst Mexican food i have ever had. Their skirt steak was drier than a beef jerky and the sauce on top looked like diarrhea.  The so called best dish they serve, enchilldas tasted like Swanson's frozen mexican dinner. A huge portion of horse poop is still Kaakaa.  All the rave reviews are about their margaritas, so the majority of people are bunch of drunks who have absolutely no taste buds."}
{"text":"I was surprised by the quality of service we received here!  My drink never had a chance to get empty, and we were checked on often enough but without feeling like our privacy was being invaded.  

I ordered the vegetarian combo with a cheese enchilada & a bean tostada with refried beans & rice.  All of it was way saltier than I like, but it wasn't inedible.  And consistency-wise, the enchiladas could learn something from the overly-pureed beans; I needed a knife for the former and could have used a spoon on the latter.  I had a bite of my boyfriend's chile relleno, and it was okay but not what I'm used to from taquerias in Chicago.  The complimentary chips and salsa were great.. perfectly light crispy chips and the salsa with pico de gallo in it was really good.  If the rest of the food was as good as the chips & salsa, they'd get a 5 star rating.  Everything was very reasonably priced.   

The restaurant itself was bright, colorful & clean."}
{"text":"I ate Acapulco.. It was really goooood !!  The shrimp was perfect. I order the same for my second time there.  I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food and huge portions!  Very happy (and full) from our experience here.  Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. The ambience is cute, the service is friendly and incredibly fast, and the food is good and really affordable. I've never been dissapointed by anything I've ever ordered here.
I have no idea what \"real\" Mexican food tastes like having been born and raised here in the midwest but from what I've had of Mexican food this is one of the places I like best."}
{"text":"For the price it's amazing. I've never had food I haven't liked here. A huge selection of dishes to choose from and really fast service. 5 stars."}
{"text":"The only place to eat Mexican in Shampoo-Banana."}
{"text":"For fair to middlin' Mexican, Dos was ALWAYS a great option!  Super fast seating, warm basket of chips and a house blended salsa, and a few menus about three minutes through the door!  Can't beat that.

Servers ALWAYS ask you for a drink order, and they come back with them rapido!  Food's the same way.  No sooner are you sipping on a margarita, then you're grabbing the warm edge of a plate of nachos or soft tacos!  It's just that fast!

The food, like I said, is fair to middlin'.  They're not trying to be anything they're not.  It's just good, wholesome, down-to-Earth Mexican fare, simple ingredients, and often just assembled (so there's not a whole lot of \"cooking\" involved, if you know what I mean).  It's ridiculously cost effective, too.  For the amount of food you get (and you get A LOT!), the price is kind of astounding.  How they're able to give you so much for so little is beyond me!

Dos is just a comfortable, nice spot to hang out with family and friends.  Kids are welcome, too, and definitely on hand!  If you have a baby or young kids, this is a great place to come.  Menus are laminated, the tables get a quick wash down between seatings (so anything spilled is no trouble!), and the volume is always within that range where children kind of drown out. ;D  New parents, never fear!"}
{"text":"I was staying at one of the nearby hotels and didn't want a chain so I decided to come here. The place was packed. I waited just a couple minutes for table and was seated. From the time I sat and placed my order to getting my food, it was maybe 20 minutes total and I even sent the waiter back once because I wasn't ready. The service was super fast!  

I wish I could say the food was just as good. It was average. I enjoyed that they gave you two different salsa options and my margarita on the rocks was good, however I ordered the enchiladas Mexicanos and it was good but not great. The serving size was huge but the food was just bland. I actually had to add salt and a bunch of the salsa just to give it some flavor.

I would try this again if I were back in the area and try a different option."}
{"text":"I had a chimichanga, but enjoyed my daughter's dish better. She ordered the molcahete filled with skirt steak, chicken and shrimp, cactus and jalapenos, served with a side of rice and beans. It was delicious with a mango margarita on the rocks. Fast and courteous service. Expect a long wait time for a table for dinner after 6 pm, especially if it's a weekend."}
{"text":"A good choice - Always solid!  Delicious!  I used to eat here four times a week for lunch - love the chicken and shrimp fajitas.  

Ice cold cerveza and great margaritas.  The atmosphere is so-so but the food is always amazing and FAST!"}
{"text":"Awesome speedy service, my waiter was knowledgable of the menu and about to suggest something new for me to try with chicken and it was delicious. I got my money worth and the service was awesome, felt like I was back home."}
{"text":"Went here because of the good reviews--not impressed.  We got two bowls of \"salsa,\" the milder of which tasted like unseasoned canned tomatoes, and the other was pretty much the same except for a bit of pepper and onion.  We added some hot sauce not necessarily because we wanted a lot of spice, but just to give it some flavor.  Enchilada sauce was also pretty bland and tasteless.  Meat was good though.  I asked twice for a diet coke that I never received.  On the plus side, the food is inexpensive and plentiful, but there are better alternatives in town."}
{"text":"Great Mexican restaurant in Champaign. Their bottomless chips - that came out hot - with two different kinds of salsa was a great way to start off the meal. I'm not sure what equates as \"great\" for others, but Dos Reales was soo good. I had the choritacos with chicken, and mmm out came three STUFFED flour tacos stuffed with spicy chorizo and (slightly dry) chicken and liberally sprinkled with lettuce, cilantro, and diced onions. Everyone I went with loved what they got - my sister got the vegetarian fajita quesadilla and MMMM lots of cheese and stewed veggies. The price isn't too bad, $8 for a huge dinner-sized plate during lunch, and the servers were very nice and helpful and the service was very fast. I recommend this place over fast food chain of stomach churning Chipotle. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"This place only raised my expectations of having Mexican food! The acapulco and rice milk drink whose name I forgot are the must try items for the first people to visit! Also the service is awesome and they refill your drinks for free! You can visit it again to try other awesome Mexican dishes the restaurant has to offer
."}
{"text":"Everyone likes Dos except for me it seems, which is a shame since it's cheap, near campus, and the service is good. What can I say? The meat quality reminds me of The Jungle, the \"spicy\" sauces are incredibly bland, and everything seems to be soaked in puce-colored refried beans. 

The hilarious thing is how every item on the menu is pretty much the same...there is very little difference between the tacos, the burritos, the tamales, or anything else. Entrees are a lot better than the specials. The carne asada tacos, while very much not carne asada, are OK. The ambiance can be summed up with a description of the walls: pink and orange sponge paint. 

Dos Reales has a lot of loyal fans, but I prefer El Charro or Los Amigos."}
{"text":"Their spinach enchilada is great, but the sauce is made with dairy :(
The fajitas were awesome (ask for no sour cream); the refried beans had character (ask for no cheese), and the guac salad was a nice touch. (I need to find out if the guac is made with dairy. It seems like they might be using dairy for many dishes...) Their salsa could use a little more spice and depth, but it was a good, basic salsa.
I don't know if they make their own Sangria or use a bottled brand, but it was the perfect compliment to my fajitas. Hubby had a GIANT margarita - I mean, this thing might have come in a bucket instead of a glass - and he enjoyed every drop.
The staff was very attentive and on-point. And I really liked the fact that when they communicated with each other it looked and sounded like they were having fun and working really well together. Good vibes.
We will return to this joint often."}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican food in champaign/urbana.  The chips are promptly served as soon as you sit down and their meals come out so fast you would think they had to have been made for some other table, but it happens consistently.

I love the Pollo ala Parria as my main dish either at lunch or dinner, it never disappoints.  Go here for the best Mexican you will find in either city!"}
{"text":"Dos Reales was my favorite Mexican restaurant in the C-U area (as well as one of my favorite restaurants period) when I lived there a couple of years ago. This had a lot to do with the price point. Without fail, you can always get an entire meal at Dos for under $10. That is including drink and tip. What's even more amazing is the amount of food they give you for how little you pay. First, they start you out with free unlimited chips and salsa. Then, I would always chuckle to myself when they brought out my giant quesadilla I paid ~$3 for. I always felt like I was ripping them off...

The thing that really put this place over the top for me though was when we went there for a friend's birthday. They were incredibly nice and gave him a free margarita and tequila shot. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"If you want good mexican food this is the place to try. I had the chimichanga which was a very big plate and game rice and guacamole, sour cream, lettuce, and beans. While it was very delicious, it was very oily and slightly overwhelming .Service was definitely a bit slow and they messed up a order and it took them longer than it should have to fix it. I also ordered nachos as an appetizer which was a mistake because they have unlimited salsa chips! Overall, good experience, decent price, and good portions. I need to go back and try their margaritas!"}
{"text":"Dopest Dope Ever Ate.  Yeah!  I heard the hype and it lived up to it.  The menu was extensive, but I just got off the special board.  I got the monster margarita: two coronas in a 32 oz strawberry margarita. And a M-something burrito: Steak, Bacon, Onions, and Cheese sauce. Portions were large. Environment was great."}
{"text":"Oh yeah I liked this place nice casual atmosphere nice Mexican music jamming and a cold ass corona in my table after a hard day at work. I had the burrito bravo de asada with the rice and pico d Gallo on the side was good ass hell! Service was nice, fast and the price was even better. They also offered me a hotter sauce that the waitress brought from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Dos Reales is the BEEZNEEZ of Mexican cuisine.  Although they may cost a little bit more than some of the other Mexican restaurants, the high quality of the food being used to create the fantastic menu that they offer offsets that one small inconvenience very quickly. The decor is okay, but the drinks are cold and the food is hot and delicious. The staff tends to be friendly and fast. All and all, Dos Reales is definitely a hood spot to stop and have a great meal."}
{"text":"Bland Vomit. Vomit served in a variety of ways at Dos Reales. I can't believe anyone likes this place.

If you like this place, you either a) don't know the meaning of flavorful Mexican food or b) have no taste buds and can't wait to have nasty diarrhea in a few hours."}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago while in town visiting friends. Four of us went here to celebrate my friend's 21st birthday. The service was a little slow but the food and prices were great!! I ordered chicken fajita tacos- so much food I couldn't finish! I also had a frozen margarita which was pretty good. We also sat outside on their patio which was perfect. 

We had let our server know it was our friend's birthday, and he and a bunch of other servers came out and sang and brought her a sopapilla dessert. Very nice touch.

If I'm back in town sometime, I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great service and a courteous staff. Loved the enchiladas!  Great place just off he interstate!"}
{"text":"This location is not as good as the University Ave. location (which is now closed), but it is still one of the better Mexican restaurants in the Champaign - Urbana area.  The burrito cheese steak is the my order every time I am here and it is phenomenal.  They make some pretty good margaritas too.  If you're from a bigger city like Chicago, don't expect this to be really good Mexican food...for Champaign, it's great."}
{"text":"Dos Reales is a quality sit-down Mexican restaurant that makes the most of daring to put this particular seafood special on the menu.

I picked up a horchata and fajita del mar, a special that includes shrimp, some sort of white fish and crab. Well, okay, imitation crab, so... more fish. Still!

The food was served on a sizzling plate with enough fish and fajita vegetables for two, if not three nights. The seafood was very plentiful, which is why I thought it was a little funny that I only got four small corn tortillas. That's OK, though, they tasted great.

On the side were rice and beans, and some guac served in a crispy tortilla bowl (which I ate). The sauce was pleasant and each of the sides was well-seasoned. The shrimp was tender and well-cooked, and so was the fish. As for the horchata, it was pleasantly cinnamon-flavored.

Overall, a good place to stop if you're driving through and are looking for a good sit-down Mexican place."}
{"text":"Nope, not a fan. I don't know how you can mess up a simple cheese quesadilla but they manage to."}
{"text":"Well, I was underwhelmed.

I went in to this place, expecting good, authentic Mexican food.  What I got was authentic.

Starters: Chips and salsa - two types of salsa, no explanation.  It's not like we can't figure out one is hot and one isn't, but the dishes were small, and it went quick.

The main course - we ordered a bunch of different stuff for our party of 4.  One order got messed up.  I ordered a Burrito Supremo, but it was more like a Burrito el-blando.  It had no zip to it at all - I've had better Burritos at Food Life in Chicago.

Honestly, I've had better Mexican food at La Mex.  If I'm dying for Mexican food, I guess I'll give it another try, but there has to be better Mexican than this in Champaign."}
{"text":"I give this five stars not because its as good as it gets anywhere but it is definitely as good as it gets locally.  Their chimichangas are so good it's all I get when I go there.  There prices are good and the speed of service is amazing.  Portions sizes are definitely split-able."}
{"text":"Special diets beware!

Someone in my party ordered chicken. Another person in my table ordered shrimp and had bits of chicken among their shrimp. 

I had an allergic reaction - I would guess they cooked my meal along the shrimp.

Our waiter was great, but the guy who brought out the food was rude. Slammed the hot plates carelessly on the table. The kitchen made two errors in our order, which the waiter corrected quickly.

Fast, cheap and tasty, but we were grossed-out by cross-contamination."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant, all of there food is amazing and delicious, my favorites are the chicken fajita quesadilla, horchata, and chile relleno with ground beef on top salsa roja.  Gerardo is a great waiter and always takes care of me and my kids."}
{"text":"Love going here. Fantastic vegetarian options, the horchata comes in large mugs if you have a party of 2 (and unlimited refills!) 

My favorite mexican restaurant in Champaign by far. It is definitely worth the drive to Dos Reales instead of the walk to Burrito King. 

10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant regularly for the 4 years I went to UIUC. After Over 90% of the time, I didn't even stop when entering the restaurant because they were ready to seat the next group-seemingly regardless of how busy the place was! The staff is remarkably professional, courteous, and polite. Then after they seat you insanely quickly, they prepare your food at lightning speed as well. Here's the kicker: the food is actually great! If you love cheap Mexican food, I can't imagine why you would go anywhere else in Chambana. 

I recommend ordering their chicken chimichanga a la carte. A great deal, no this and that to deal with on the side, and just enough to fill a girl's belly!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am a huge fan of Mexican food--it is actually my favorite cuisine.  When faced with the choice of where to eat Mexican in Champaign-Urbana, Dos Reales never fails to be top of mind.  I'd be embarrassed to find out how many times I have actually eaten here (or picked up take-out).

I love Dos Reales for 
1. the consistency of taste and quality of the menu items.
2. the friendly waiters and waitresses I recognize with each visit.
3. always making sure I have chips and [2 varieties of] salsa throughout the entire dining experience.
4. bringing out the food an average 10 minutes after I place an order.

Dos is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat with family, post up and drink margs with a group of friends or even enjoy a taco salad on the outdoor patio. 

Don't ever forget to mention that it's someone in your party's birthday because you'll be missing out on the sombrero & song experience!

P.S. Get the \"Nachos Supreme for hungry ones,\" if you like eating challenges. My college roommate and I call it 'for the hungry ONE' because one person can do serious damage on this heaping plate of nachos--if they just believe."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to say that Champaign has a fair amount of relatively authentic Mexican restaurants!

I usually do Dos Reales by myself, and I get the food to go and eat it in my hotel room.  I love white cheese dip, and their's is pretty tasty.  Guacamole is also good, which I get on the Chalupa.  I've also tried their quesadillas, which are stuffed with fillings and white cheese dip (not flat)."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken. Great prices. Even for the margaritas. Great hole in the wall place. Very loud and not the best service, but would go again and recommend."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here but the chips and salsa were a bit disappointing - salsa too \"tomatoey\" and runny for me.  I had the Chili Rellenos stuffed with chicken which were very good. My colleague had chicken fajitas and said they were were excellent.  The service was amazing and they gave you ice-chilled mugs with the beer. Better salsa and this place, which is obviously well thought of locally given the crowd, is a 5."}
{"text":"The ironclad rule of BBQ and Mexican joints is, the worse the place looks on the outside, the better the food is on the inside.

Dos Reales looks like a dump.  The food is outstanding.

First off, you'll notice the menu is enormous.  It takes some time to sift through all the options.  On a friend's recommendation, I got the burrito bravo - just an enormous burrito.  You can choose steak or chicken.  I ordered steak, but my girlfriend got a taco with the chicken and it was mindblowing.  (The chicken is shredded and pulls apart, like what you get out of a slow cooker.)

If I went again, I'd go with chicken for sure.

The house margarita was just so-so.  A little too tart for my taste.

Service was excellent, quick and friendly.

And everything is absurdly cheap.

It's a shame they close so early, because this would be amazing hangover food.  (Someone needs to throw their hours up on Yelp.  The day we called, they closed at 10:30 p.m.)"}
{"text":"My absolute FAVORITE Mexican restaurant!!!!!! I always get the enchiladas suizas. Their cheese sauce is sooo amazing. We get the large side order too- comes in a boat. Because who doesn't want cheese in a boat?! YUMMMM"}
{"text":"It's the best damn Mexican food in Champaign, and it's only given me the poops maybe one, two times?  In all honesty, the service here is pretty fast and polite, and when the food comes out I am rarely disappointed.  Very few items are strictly vegetarian as almost everything is made with animal fat or cheese.  However, if you can put the fact that in one way or another you're probably eating animal byproduct (or just product) then it's great.  I love the DR!

Note: I never eat there anymore because (SURPRISE!) it's really fattening."}
{"text":"If you live in CU and haven't been to Dos you need to go.  The first time I went I really wasn't impressed that much, but my longtime CU resident friend convinced me to go back and try something else. 
 
I did.  

The Chicken Fajita Quesadilla. 

 It has to be one of the best and most satisfying \"Mexican\" meals I have eaten.  Don't think for a moment that this is real authentic Mexican, what it is is amazingly gooey, cheesy sauce covering succulent chicken, peppers, and onions all in and on a HUGE tortilla.  If you are in the mood for some Mexican flavors go here and order this.  Not only does it cost $6.50, but me and my friends usually split it between two people and with free chips and salsa plus tip get away for about $4-$5 a person, it rocks!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I really liked the fajitas quesadilla with grilled shrimp. Tasty and with high quality. We enjoyed our time there with the cozy environment"}
{"text":"Dos is definitely the place to go if you're looking for a lot of food for a great price. I've been here too many times to count. It's a lot of fun to just go there to drink, be with friends and eat til your stomach explodes. On the weekends during the school year it gets pretty packed in there and you might have to wait but I would say it's worth it. I love the enchiladas supremas and the burrito bravo (and yes it is big and yes I ate it in one sitting once... sad). They also have great margaritas. If you have cheap college friends (which if you're in college I'm sure you have), this is a prefect place to go!"}
{"text":"Good food. Good drinks... but the ambience? GHETTO.  Loud foul language and ignorant behavior wasn't on the menu. The management should silence the trash."}
{"text":"Ate there today and I have to say I am not really impressed at all. Their tamales were disgusting. However, the burritos and rice were great! It took us about 20 mins to get drinks; but ironically enough we got our food as soon as we got our drinks. It's not terrible food by any means, there are just better places around the champaign area than that. Staff was friendly and kept drinks filled when we finally got them. It's a beautiful restaurant too. Wouldn't recommend for an everyday Mexican food lover as the food is not stellar!"}
{"text":"Good food, extremely fast service, really helpful waiters, great chips and salsa.  I love going back to this place and i can get a filling meal plus leftovers for under $8.  Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Loved it tonight, as always. Staff is totally accommodating. Service is amazingly fast. And yes, some of the food is americanized Mexican, but some of it IS authentic, and it's ALL delicious. And if you tip well, they will remember you and treat you like royalty. 

Of course, there's no reason NOT to tip well, as long as the service is friendly. And when the service is as good as it is here, a stellar tip is really a moral imperative."}
{"text":"I partly judge a Mexican restaurant by the Queso Fundido (cheese with chorizo), and theirs is really great. Order it and really enjoy - and use it on the chips.   The best Mex in Champaign.  I know Mexican is very different in varoius parts of the country -- and many dishes in Mexico would not go over well in the MidWest.   

Only been to Prospect location.  And like the outdoor (even if a bit too close to the street area) on a nice warm day with a Margarita!"}
{"text":"This place was frighteningly crowded when we went.  Urbana-Champaign has a lot of restaurants, but judging by the teeming masses at Dos Reales, you'd think it was the only place to eat in the entire universe.  They have a \"wait until your number is called\"-system, which worked okay, but that's only because one of us heard the faint shout of our number being called.

I have nothing against the service or the food.  The service was incredibly fast, given how many people were in that vast Mexican food labyrinth.  Our server was nice, too, which I wouldn't have expected.  The chips and salsa were tasty, as was my food and margarita (the margarita was strong, which is oh-so-important).  We got to stay as long as we wanted without getting the stink eye.  Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Not great... Not terrible... 

The food here is pretty cheap, but if you ask for anything extra they'll be sure to charge you. For example: I asked for a little bit of cheese to put on my fajitas and they added $3.50 to my bill.

As far as quality... If you're looking for mexican food, this place will get the job done. The service isn't horrible, but don't make too many special requests because they will likely be ignored or forgotten. 

Dos is generous with portions and has a huge menu with countless entrees to choose from. I came on a Saturday  night around 7 with a smaller group and although the place was packed, there was no wait! 

The place is packed and locals often rave about it, but after trying it out I'm unimpressed."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I were passing through town and decided we needed to eat before we passed through.  We literally chose an exit and saw DOS Reales and decided to give it a try.  The parking lot was packed so we were wondering how long it would be to get seated.  Luckily, the place is rather large so we were seated right away.  The menu is huge...so many options.  I had a hard time deciding so I asked our waiter what he recommended and he said \"Acapulco.\"  I asked him what the most popular dish was and he responded with the same dish.

I ended up ordering the Acapulco and the waiter said that if I did not like it, he would let me order something else instead.  When the dish came, I could not believe how much food was there!  The meat mixture of steak, chicken and shrimp was yummy.  The chicken enchilada included was good as well.  There were two disappointments.  The rice was not very good, it was VERY dry.  Also, the dish said it would be smothered in cheese but when it came, I would not call it smothered.  It just had a small portion of cheese on it.

Regardless of the two disappointments, the rest of the experience was good.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here the staff the menu and my actual meal were all amazing defiantly a little slice of Mexico. I recommend a tall beer and the chimichanga. Also they bring 2 kinds of salsa for the pickier people both are excellent!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here when we went to visit U of I, his alma matter.  He proclaimed it to be \"the best, most authentic Mexican food in town,\" so of course I immediately hopped on the bandwagon.  I heart Mexican food.

We walked in, and the decor was good up until we walked into the dining room, but, we honestly weren't there for the decorations, so I was willing to withhold any judgment until we tasted the food.  It was pretty crowded for being 2pm on a weekend, and I observed many orange and blue outfitted students with friends or family, and I figured that there was a good local loyalty being represented. 

We ordered off of the lunch menu.  I had some type of steak fajita with peppers, and he had some sort of variety platter with an enchilada and burrito.  We also had two gigantic margaritas, which ended up being pretty strong for what I thought we'd get.

The food arrived very quickly and our server was pleasant, but I was SO disappointed by the food. It was fresh and warm, but was just BLAND.  There was little to no seasoning.  I am not a talented cook by any means, but I could have replicated my meal at home and probably could have made it more flavorful.

The only \"plus\" I guess you could say is that it's cheap and service is fast.  Maybe that's why all the college kids love it.  Me, I'd rather pay a bit more and have a flavorful meal that takes a little longer.

I probably wouldn't go back if we ended up in Champaign-Urbana unless I was drunk and just needed a plate full of food to fill me up."}
{"text":"Very serviceable Mexican place, even by \"big city\" standards.  They deal with crowds from Illinois football games and do so gracefully.  Even with a packed house and a big line, the food comes out hot, tasty, and correct.  You'd think you're the only guests."}
{"text":"Large amounts of food for a great price, and it's tasty. Free refills on horchata are great. Service was great and food comes out to your table at a record pace. 

Menu had an amazing variety of choices to choose from."}
{"text":"Good authentic mexican. If you couldn't tell by the name. The staff was speedy and friendly. The food was very good. And you got a lot for the price. And of course chips and salsa!
Wasn't fond of the noise and crowded dining room. 
Definitely would go again."}
{"text":"Authentic or not, I absolutely love Dos. It's always a fun atmosphere, good staff, and food that exceeds the price. Very large portion sizes for what you pay and great margaritas. My personal favorites are the Alambre and Acapulco. Both include extremely fresh meat with delicious sauce/cheese. Everyone I've gone here with loves it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place in town!  Full disclosure, the Tex part of the Tex-Mex is very dominant, and yes, the food used to be better years ago.  If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is not the place for you.  However, if you're looking for a tasty meal in a casual setting, with very generous portions, try them out.  My favorite is always the fajitas set, with sizzling fajitas, hot sides, and warm tortillas."}
{"text":"We were visiting the area from out of state.  We arrived for an early dinner.  We were served promptly and had great service.  Our food arrived quickly and was exactly what we expected.  A really good experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone about the portion sizes being fairly large for the low prices they charge. Their food is phenomenal and you can tell its made with heart. Pollo con crema was my favorite although the chicken ranchero came a close second."}
{"text":"Came out on Mom's weekend, and I was amazed how well we were taken care of inspire of the crazy crowds of people. Food was 4 stars but service was definitely five star!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Champaign Urbana. Everything tastes great and service is fast and friendly.  The cost is perfect. Never go wrong."}
{"text":"I used to be a Dos Reales partisan myself - until the last few visits.  Both locations have been dicey in recent years - my main complaint is that on multiple occasions my stomach \"rejected\" my meal shortly after leaving the restaurant. Went down fine but didn't stay. I know what yr thinking - I was sober as a judge and most definitely not hung-over.  I wish it wasn't so, but I have crossed Dos off my list, same experience with La Bamba. But yes, cheap and good - I'm not saying yr going to barf, just that I did.  Twice."}
{"text":"Dos Reales has always been great whenever I've gone there.  Service is always fantastic.  The food comes out fast and the waiters usually refill your drinks, chips, and salsa really speedily.  Also, one time my friend's mom had our waiter write down a bunch of Spanish swear words (she's a teacher and has some Spanish-speaking students) and he complied.  I think the guy got a pretty generous tip for that.

Their food is real cheap and delicious, too, especially the combos.  I always get the number 11: enchilada, burrito, and a taco for about $6.50.  Tasty!  Admittedly, I haven't tried many of the other items on the menu because the combinations are just such a great deal."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars!  I love coming to Dos, as we affectionately call it, whenever I'm in Champaign.  There's a ton on the menu to choose from, some good specials, and good prices!  Plus, who can pass up unlimited chips and salsa?

Every time I've come here the place has been packed, which speaks about how good it is!

I ordered the chicken enchiladas suiza- chicken enchiladas covered in a cheese sauce (yummmm) and served with sides of rice (refried or black) and rice.  The beans covered in the queso from the enchiladas is out of this world.  I have started making my own because it's that delicious.  My only complaint was that the chicken was little dry inside the enchiladas, but everything else was good.

The server was very friendly and called us amigo and amiga.  Our drinks and food were served in a timely fashion too.  When we left, we had to push through a crowd of people to get out the door.  Love Dos!"}
{"text":"Burrito chipotle and tomale on the side, fast friendly and off the charts delicious. Good selection of hot sauces to spice things up an least expensive beers I've found in a while"}
{"text":"Cheap, good, authentic Mexican.  I also highly recommend their sweet tea and mango margaritas.  They also do take-out which is amazing because you can go in, order, and leave with your meal within 10 minutes.  Sure it's not as fast as McDonald's, but it's way better.  Only downside, it can get busy during high-peak times and the line can get long."}
{"text":"Dos Reales on Prospect is the ONE place to go in Champaign for amazing Mexican food. Don't even think about going to the one on University (well, unless you're on campus or the line at the Prospect one is ridiculous).

Why they're awesome? Everything on their menu is delicious and comes in ginormous portions! And those of you who can finish a burrito bravo in one sitting seriously deserve some sort of medal.

Also, Dos has SUPER fast service - your orders come out in like 5 minutes. I love not having to wait for food!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken chimichanga. Weird flavored sauce that made the chicken inside the chimi red. Never had that in there before. The rice was very bland. Barely any flavor. The salad with lettuce, guacamole, and tomato barely came with any diced up tomatoes and was served with half a tomato slice on top. This salad was also very bland. Chips were not very fresh. Decent amount of food for the money but all really bland."}
{"text":"I'm surprised there are so many positive reviews about this place. The food is not authentic. It's bland. A very Americanized version of Mexican food. The portions are huge so I guess that's a good thing? Yeah... I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I just got back from dinner and it was great! I have been here a couple of times in the past and I remembered that I had a very good experience. I ordered a shrimp fajita quesadilla and it was fantastic. I also ordered the jumbo margarita and it was great as well. I didn't care for the salsa but each to their own on something like that. This was a great dinner and a must visit on my next trip to Champaign."}
{"text":"I heart this place and go every time I return to UIUC.  (Which is becoming harder to do as I get older...)

The food is delicious and what makes me want to come back.  The vegetarian combos are particularly good, too.  Mom & pop-style Mexican food - none of that Chili's/Chipotle nonsense.

Service is prompt and your food is there before you know it.  My imagination leads me to believe that there is a Dos Reales Pit Crew that is timed from order to table delivery.  Prices are reasonable and it's great for groups.  

And the margaritas, oh the margaritas. =)"}
{"text":"Um, this place is a tradition - a staple for all graduating UIUC folk like myself.  I didn't fully appreciate it when I was there. Senior year, I started going more often, to partake in the insanely cheap margaritas and filling, hearty Mexican food.  Now, whenever I visit my campus, I return to get my fill of the deliciousness.

I love how incredibly inexpensive this place is.  Seriously, $16 for a 60 oz pitcher of margaritas?  WHAT?  We'll take two, thanks.  $9.50 for a big portion of fajitas with tons of delicious beans, rice, and guac?  Totes.  And if you order off the ala carte menu, you can practically pay with change from under your couch.

It's actually pretty tasty too.  I looooove their tamales.  The bean burritos are pretty good too, and as soon as I bite into that familiar salsa, I melt.  They refill the chips constantly.  Portions are large and satisfying - it's pretty classic Mexican food for an American crowd, not reinventing the wheel here, but it's consistent and nostalgic.  The margaritas are always delicious, though sometimes they are stronger than others.  Service is usually very friendly and quick.  It's like memories covered in chile sauce with a side of beans and rice.  Dos Reales, I'll always love you.

I bet this place gets mad crowded since they closed the Dos on University Ave.  Why on earth would they do that?  Shame.  Now you need to have a designated driver instead of being able to stumble back to Green Street after dinner."}

Seriously, coming from Chicago, you can NOT get food this cheap/tasty anywhere in the city.  Seriously, you can't!  I think my friends and I spent about $12 each - that's dinner for everyone, plus 1/4 of a 60 oz flavored margarita pitcher.  Come on now, what a steal!

{"text":"I can count the restaurants that offer a decent satisfying meal in champaign with one hand, so that is telling you that a good restaurant in champaign is hard to come by.

Location is a bit more remote from the U of I campus, bit definitely come out here rather than chipotle or maize. You can get their lunch specials, which is a good deal. Every table is served with chips and salsa. Nice hmemade chips. Fast service. The shrimp fajitas had nice jumbo shrimps, but portion was kinda small. You can get the combo plate with chicken, shrimp and steak that comes with rice and beans with tortilla. Great deal and you get a little bit of everything. Never had to order an appetizer here since the chips and the entrees were already fulfilling. 
Ample seating, ample parking."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places in Champaign-Urbana. Every time I go, I'm never disappointed. I also love the decor. They definitely embrace their culture with the decor. Every time I go I'm seated in a new place and I have different decor to look at it. The whole restaurant is shaped as a adobe too.

At my latest trip here, I had a margarita for the first time. I love that they had margaritas on their daily specials. It was a blue margarita and it was worth the $5.75. My friends got mango margaritas and those were pretty good too!

I think the best part of Dos Reales is the amount of food you get for your money. You definitely get a lot of food for what you pay. This time around I stuck to just a carne asada quesadilla. It was so simple, but incredibly tasty. 

Also when you sit down, they give you a basket of chips and two kinds of salsa. I love when that happens. 

The service was pretty good, too. The waiter was attentive and would frequently refill our water. He also made a joke about refilling out margaritas.

I'll definitely keep going back.

Just make sure that you have a empty stomach when you go or you might end up taking home leftovers, which isn't bad a thing though."}
{"text":"Dos is pretty good, as far as cheap Mexican food goes.  It's certainly heads-and-shoulders over La Bamba, which is possibly the most disgusting place I've ever eaten, but that's not saying a whole lot.

I actually go to Dos fairly frequently, because it's close, it's cheap, and at the end of the day, it's pretty solid.  Yeah, I pay for it a couple hours later, but that's most Mexican food for you.

The chips and salsa are good, nothing special.  They serve two kinds: one that has chopped vegetables in it, and the other that's like a paste.  If you ask, they'll just refill whichever one you prefer.

The menu is decent, except almost everything comes absolutely smothered in cheese sauce.  Some people love it, but I get sick of it.  Make sure you get beans: for whatever reason, they're tasty here, and I *hate* beans.

All-in-all, not pricey, decent food, and usually pretty quick service.  If you're staying around campus, this is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"It's pretty good by the typical American-Mexican restaurant standards in the area.  Not really actually that Mexican.  If you're looking for a chicken fajita to come out sizzling in less than five minutes, they're the place.

The staff is always unreasonably nice for the amount of business they turn out.  The place is pretty clean and has plenty of seating.  The prices are good at about $6-8 a plate.

Sometimes I wonder how they made my food so fast, though..."}
{"text":"I went there after constantly hearing about the hype, everyone loves this place.  I'm not sure why.  it was dirty, the bathrooms weren't clean, the food was average at best, the waitstaff was rude, and yet it was packed.  I think it's just college students who love to eat cheap, but if quality is what you're going for, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"This is the second Mexican restaurant I've tried in this area and again the beef is unseasoned and the red sauce is marinara. I won't be back to this one either...sorry."}
{"text":"We used to call this place the \"Dr.\", from the initials D. R.  Clever, for college kids, maybe maybe not.  But it was effective in the following types of sentences:  \"I'm hungover and hungry.  I need a DR.\"  Yeah, I know groan.  But seriously the food was always very large, very fast, tasty, and within budget.  I tried the rest of the mexican joints in the C-U and the dr. was always the best.  What can you ask.  Now, living in Chicago, surrounded by many, many Mexican restaurants.  I still yearn for the food here.  A case of memory being better than reality?  Maybe.  But I still get reports for younger folk at U of I that the dr. is still the sh*t (pardon my lang).  So it still gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"My favorite sit down (but still quick) Mexican place. Love the enchiladas and the beans and rice. Also love being able to get a coke in a bottle with actual sugar instead of corn syrup. Service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Dos Reales makes good, cheap, and fast Mexican food.  I went to the Urbana location before it closed, and made the mistake of ordering something with the cheese sauce (blegh).  Now that I knew what to get, I was not disappointed.  The carne asada tacos were plentiful and tasty, but could have used more cilantro.  The servers are very friendly, but the addition of \"Amigo\" to every sentence got annoying.  Still, I think this place beats every other chain restaurant on Prospect."}
{"text":"There are quite a lot of Mexican places in Chambana, but this one always seemed to be the place we'd go back to again and again. The food is cheap, the service is quick and the food is good. Good chips and salsa, they serve Coca Cola products, and they have a patio area too. My favorite was the fajita taco salad. Any of their \"fajita\" dishes - fajita quesadilla, fajita taco salad, fajita burrito - all of them are soooo flavorful. It's right off the highway too, so it's a worth a quick stop if you're just traveling through too! I probably went here around 10-20 times a year while I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Decent food, good service, large portions. Busy place , food is tasteful. 
I had the carne asada plate. The meat was tasty and tender.
The margaritas are huge if you ask for the large one.
I recommend this place for good mexican food."}
{"text":"Dos Reales is amazing! Pollo asado quesadilla is my go-to. You get so much food for a reasonable price. Margaritas are a must! They usually have margarita specials as well."}
{"text":"#1, we are native Texans who love and adore Mexican food  (ie:Tex Mex).  I personally really enjoyed the food here, and the service was excellent.   Not a ton of spice or kick to the food, but enough for me.  I got the vegetarian option C with burrito and chili relleno.  My husband,  however,  HATED what he got--some burrito rojo option.  Cubed beef.  He said it tasted like beef chopped up and heated in a can of  cheap red sauce.... \"Minus the flavor.\"  Don't think I'll be able to convince him to head back for a 2nd try. Bummer."}
{"text":"Yeah, so in C-U, the big question in mexican food is Dos or El Toro.  This is seriously a divisive issue.  But not for me.  It has never been.  Dos Reales rules the mexican food kingdom of Champaign-Urbana.  I miss their chicken quesadilla -- big enough for 2 easily and super cheap.  Service was always friendly.  If you go on a weekend night, be prepared for a wait.  But it WILL be worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is so hot!!!!!!  Their margaritas although not made like a real Mexican one they at least have booze:). My #1 pick in CU:). Eat here often!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican restaurant in C-U. I only wish they had more than one location. I prefer their food, by far, to El Toro but Dos is getting left behind as far as market share is concerned. Please open a location in Urbana!"}
{"text":"Not the highest, or seemingly freshest, quality Mexican food but it was fatty and tasty. I would say that this place is good as a hangover \"cure\" or when someone needs a comforting pick-me-up food."}
{"text":"I went here, and with the huge 45 minute wait, I was expecting amazing food, What I got was meh food, Our server was on top of the table, but my meal came out a good 10 minutes after my dining partners meal, and while the server was super apologetic, food should never come out so far apart! And to be honest the food I got well, it was just bland, and boring, It was terrible. Maybe its because  I am used to getting authentic Mexican food, but even compared to the tex-mex I get this was sub par. Although you do get a nice portion for the price that you are paying, so there is that.

Long story short, this place is perfect for people with huge appetites, small budgets, and those who care about quantity over quality.In other words a typical college student.  I really wouldn't recommend it for anyone else."}
{"text":"Burrito green Chile and burrito rojo we're both fantastic. Some of the best flavored Chile outside of the southwest that I've had, and I was raised in New Mexico."}
{"text":"It's a toss up between here and El Torerro on which is the best Mexican place in Champaign Urbana.... but seriously.... you'll rarely find a Mexican place this good and cheap.

Try the Fajita-quesadilla.... GENIUS.

You KNOW you'll miss it when you leave the area... trust me :P"}
{"text":"Food poisoning!  4 of us went to Dos Reales the other day and two of us winded up getting food poisoning--one with the puking kind.  We ordered a pollo con mole dish and a shrimp burrito dish and we both got sick.  They need to evaluate the freshness of the foods they feed people.  It can make life miserable for a while..."}
{"text":"I wish the University Ave. location hadn't closed.  I basically live across the street from where it used to be.  Though maybe it's for the best, as I'd eat there far too often if it was still open...

Almost every time my parents come down, we stop here for a pitcher of margaritas or three.  Call it a strange family tradition, if you will.  The margaritas are tasty and cheap.  What more could you want?

Food to go with the margaritas, you say?  I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered.  Ok, the refried beans tend to have a strange film over the top, but it could be so much worse.  They still taste fine.  And sure, the food might not be the epitome of traditional Mexican food, but that doesn't mean it can't be good.  Oh, the food's cheap too.  Cheap food, cheap alcohol?  Sounds like a winning combination to me!"}
{"text":"The best service, delicious food, incredible price. My boyfriend and I have been looking for a go to Mexican restaurant, and this place is it. The portions are huge, and you will have enough food for two days. The staff is also incredibly friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Champaign-Urbana! Fast, delicious, cheap, tasty, etc. This is a must dinner spot in the CU."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dinner one Friday night. I've tried most of the Mexican places on campus, and since my friend had a car, we decided to make our way off-campus to Dos Reales, which has glowing reviews on Yelp.

We came in at about 8:30, the place had quite a few people in it, but there were many open tables and we didn't have to wait.

The inside looks like a Mexican cantina with lots of bright colors and even some rustic decorations.

We perused the extensive menu and settled on beef flautas for me and chicken tacos for her.

My beef flautas were surprisingly good. They were filled with a braised beef and green pepper that had a little kick to it. The rice was pretty standard but the beans were quite delicious. My meal was definitely good, a little better than expected, actually. She said her tacos were good and had similar good things to say about the beans. The chips and salsa were quite mediocre, probably not made in-house, but that's just a guess.

Our server was barely seen, as we didn't exactly need much from him other than to take our order and ask for the check.

For the price, the portions are good and I must've picked one of the better dishes compared to some of the lower-rated reviews. 

Decent Mexican food off campus.

I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Completely generic.  From the faux adobe building, generic bar, and at best mediocre food.  Though somehow this place is always packed and many consider the premiere Tex-Mex place in Chambana.  

Service is not out right bad on purpose,  just slow and uninformed.  The menu is as generic as it gets, and without the nostalgic feel I get from Fiesta, let alone the uniqueness from Wedge, Escabar's, or Maize.  The who's who of safe, mass pleasing food items.  Which has its place, but really nothing I care for.  Nothing special bar wise either.  Salsa is week, chips stale, guac is not fresh.  That is just the starters.  Everything just uninspired.

A place I can't even give a good old local star bump a la Fiesta Cafe.  Nothing I can really recommend here."}
{"text":"Wow...fellow Yelpers (and Illini, more importantly)...really?! 

How can you think this is the \"best Mexican ever\"?! Even by Champaign standards, I'd rather go to Chipotle or Qdoba any day of the week (I know, that is saying a lot!). The first time I went here, my roommate and I both felt sick. For some reason, we got talked into giving it another chance. No miracles happened the second time either. The food is super bland and just tastes like a huge mess on your plate. 

I tried...I really did. But a lot of Illini are from northern Illinois...and with all the Mexican choices in Chicago, I'm pretty disappointed in yall :/"}
{"text":"Basically, a whole lot of decent Mexican food for not a whole lot of money.

The place was packed with college kids, so it was pretty busy. The wait staff was excellent, with super fast service and just very attentive. The food though, was pretty standard Mexican fare. Nothing that really stood out. One disappointment though was the quesadilla that I ordered had this incredibly thick and disgusting cheese on it. Now I love cheese, but this just did not taste good, and I could barely take more than 2 bites out of it before giving up.

Extra points for portions, for being cheap, and for blazing fast service."}
{"text":"I've been to Dos way too many times now.  The food is generally mediocre at best.  The first time I went, we literally got our food 30 seconds after ordering (I'm still trying to figure out how this was even possible).  30 second food simply can't be good and it wasn't.  They seem to keep all their basic ingredients in huge warming trays in back: mexican rice, refried beans, chicken, beef (and these ingredients just don't taste that great).  Then, they do some crazy fast assembly and bring it out after a short stint under the broiler.  The only time I've really enjoyed my food was the time I ordered fajitas (I don't think they've figured out a good way to make these ahead of time).  So, I'd recommend staying away from the combo plates, but once you do that the price isn't that great (~$10 for entrees).

You must be thinking, If i disliked the food so much, why am I giving them 3 stars?  Damn good margaritas! Definitely the strongest I've had in the C-U area.  They always have the 32 oz pitcher for like $9.75, which split between 2 people, is more than enough to get you both pretty wasted (or, if you're really ambitious, just drink the whole 32 oz pitcher).  So, if you order the margaritas before the food, you likely won't care enough once you get your food to hate it.  Works like a charm every time! But, If you're not 21 yet, I'd suggest going to a place with better food!

Service is generally pretty good.  I've only had 1 slow waiter, which isn't the worst track record for a restaurant.  

Long story short: Bad to mediocre food, amazing margaritas, decent service."}
{"text":"The food is aplenty here at Dos Reales. I had myself a California burrito... I couldn't understand why they would put the cheese on the burrito instead of inside of it; it's an awkward design that makes holding it a sticky affair. Despite this, the food was pretty darn tasty."}
{"text":"Best Mexican Resturant in town!!! I always bring out of town guests here and it is on my list for celebrations when my friends and I are doing a group event. It is family friendly and a nice enviroment. If you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, I may not recommend the place because it is a somewhat noisy environment.

 I have been eating here for about three years and the food and service  has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Food is ok, price is good, serving size is pretty ok. 

very friendly and prompt service

not exceptional or excellent food, just ok. will do for a quick lunch or a simple dinner. nice salsa and good chips."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food and portion size. Pretty cheap overall. Great for vegetarians. Drinks are strong, get the monster margarita!"}
{"text":"I have sentimental love for this place but the food is usually making me feel bad afterwards. Maybe just eat too much but meh."}
{"text":"This was suggested to me and a few visitors to UI by a collegiate there. The route he suggested made it seem real close to campus, but it really wasn't. Nonetheless it was delicious! 
Pros: 
Prices
Margs (via my friend)
Guacamole
Fresh chips
Fajita Quesadilla

Cons:
Salsa - kind of bland & didn't have that zing I look for in good salsa. 
Service - not terrible, but he kept randomly disappearing when we needed him"}

Gringo food you may comment? 99.9% of all the places you eat at in the US are gringo food, so enjoy and stop being a cultural snob.

Dos Reales does it right... Best in Central Illinois.

Get the beef Chimichangas"}
{"text":"Totally solid food, solid service, and solid drinks.  But, in a city where there is substantial competition for Mexican food Dos Reales doesn't top the charts as a favorite."}

{"text":"This is definitely one of the best Mexican places in Champaign. The food and drinks are very inexpensive and the portions are generous. It is a bit scary how fast the food comes out, and has always worried my friends and I just a bit. However, when we're hungry and it tastes delicious, we seem to forget all about our worries. The service is always great. Also, if you want to drink there and the weather is nice, it's not a bad walk from campus."}
{"text":"Would choose this over \"the other popular Mexican place\"  any day although my 2nd choice in the Chambana area."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten IN the restaurant in a few years, but I will get takeout from here whenever humanly possible.

This is arguably one of the best, if not THE best, Mexican restaurants in town. I stick with the chicken fajita quesadilla and words can't describe its tastiness.

The real reason to write home? That cheese dip for the nachos which I think is Constitutionally liquid crack."}

For some reason, their food tastes the same to me, whether it's chimichanga, burritos, or tacos. I had their temales and they were overly cheesy to a point where it felt gross eating it. Yuck!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Spanish style cuisine I've had in Champaign thus far! I ordered the Acapulco, which seems like a fajita plate that included chicken, large shrimp and steak. It also includes rice and and an  enchiladas. In short, this is great food, health portion and a bed on a plate lol"}
{"text":"Maybe one of the worst Mexican restaurants I've tried...

I had a chile relleno plate with rice and beans. The mass of cheese on the beans was pretty disgusting. I like cheese a lot but this cheese was not good. It tasted like imitation cheese (cheese product). The chile relleno (something I truly love) had a bit of the flavor that it had suffered severe frostbite. I think that it may have been improperly frozen or something. :/

I wanted to like this place but I didn't enjoy the food at all. Wouldn't come here again. At least the chips and salsa were good!"}
{"text":"Year 2 Review 
For the price of the food and the variety, it still skates away with an easy 5 star. You have to be selective in what you order. So far everything I have tried at least taste fresh to order and has not been pre-cooked already. It may not be the best mexican food you have ever had or even authentic, but if you want a step up from fast food mexican then Dos Reales will not disappoint. Cheap drinks specials as well. The one thing they could do better is serve some tastier chips that don't taste like they came out of a bag along with the very watery salsa; but for the price what can you expect!

Health code rating: B/C. Lots of issues with food temperature based on the reports. I would steer clear of some of the menu items that maybe prepared ahead of time i.e. the chile relleno. http://champaign.il.gegov.com/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=754"}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price. Tried the philly cheese steak burrito and a margarita. The meat was slightly overcooked so was chewy but the caramelized onions were a good compliment. The beans were authentically bland as was the rice. The margarita was decent but no salt or lime w it. The atmosphere was what i would say is cheesy Mexican cliche and the place was a bit run down w a hole in the seat i was in and stains on the table. The service was friendly. Overall was ok and worth a shot."}

It is mouth watering. It had the most succulent mushrooms, beans and rice inside, topped with a nice creamy cheese sauce. The rice is so moist and not dry like most Mexican restaurants. The margaritas are huge and great as well. The portions are huge as well. You can't miss this place. You have to try it. 

Highly Recommended. If you don't, you are missing out big time! Oh and did I mention, its super cheap!"}
{"text":"A cheap and quick place to eat lunch.  I appreciate it when a Mexican restaurant has something other than the typical combination platters on their menu.  This restaurant had some very interesting specials.  It was very busy, but I was seated and served quickly.  Service is attentive, and it seems very clean.  The entrance is kind of a clusterf*ck when busy, but other than that it was an enjoyable meal while I was travelling to Chambana."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 10 years, and it is amazing every time!
Today I ate this steak dish that had shrimp, grilled onions, mushrooms, and cheese on it and it was so delicious I had so much food I couldn't even finish it!!
Also our waitress was so efficient and courteous!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I eat so much food I think I might die. It starts with the delicious warm chips!! Mm. And since the huge yummy lunch combos are like $5, I can eat until I think I'm going to die and have leftover to take home!

My favorite things I've had are the chiles rellenos and the margaritas, YUM.

Word of advice though, if you try to take home the chips in your leftover box, they will return to soggy tortilla pieces in your fridge and it will be heartbreaking."}
{"text":"Delicious food all around the menu, has nice vegetarian options as well. The portions are big. On top of all that, I received excellent service! Can't go wrong with that. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Wonderfully executed Mexican food.
Generous portions and favorably priced
Our 3 entrees came to the table within 5 minutes on a Friday evening at 7. The restaurant was mostly full but with plenty of helpful staff, everything flowed smoothly.
The Tacos Carne Asada were well seasoned and tender.
The soft corn taco was perfect. The tortilla wasn't chewy or dry.
The Mexican Tamales were excellent, coming with a small portion of rice, lettuce and sour cream.
Definitely a place that will get our business again."}
{"text":"This dos is pretty great for a quick lunch when you're on campus but you don't want to eat lunch on campus, especially for habitual beckman cave people like myself.  I had the enchiladas nortenas today and have no regrets.  

It does get crazy nuts busy during lunch, full of beckman faculty and grad students and other individuals who occasionally have seen the sun in the past six months. 

I can't really tell the difference between dos, el toro, and el torero, but this dos is at least as quick, cheap, and tasty at stuffing almost unidentifiable white cheese into various starches and serving them PIPING!  HOT! as the other mexican restaurants in town."}
