{"text":"Surprisingly delicious Korean food. Banchan has good variety. Staff is nice and give the place an authentic feel. I ordered the Kalbi. Comes with rice and soup. The soup is good alone. Kalbi is tasty. Nice joint to be in the Southwest. One thing for sure I will be coming back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Tried this Korean restaurant for the first time. The dynamite chicken was really good. Very crispy and sweet. Service was excellent, they had side dishes coming out frequently and offered complimentary soup. The dessert was awesome too. We really liked this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Good, savory Korean food close to Summerlin. Joanne, the server, was awesome. The loco moco bibimbap is a must. Although i wish they had a hot stone version."}
{"text":"The first time was really good but they changed the menu completely and now it's bad. They seem to have a good selection of alcohol but their food options leaves so much to be desired. None of the dishes I tried the first time around are there anymore and those were really good. The kimchi pancake reminded me of my mom's. But that is all gone. Service was slow. One both visits we came in at 11pm. On the second visit, we just up and left before we ordered drinks. Provide a better menu and service and maybe I can give a better rating. I give this place 0.5 stars out of 5. The first time around was good and that was during their soft opening. But this time it was terrible."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Cool place for a date night. Big screen tvs playing the game and K-Pop music. Ambiance is rustic and and cozy"}
{"text":"Loved everything. Everything we ordered was delicious and the service was awesome. They even gave us a complimentary dish and ice cream!! I will be coming back soon to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The food is really good and so is the service. I usually get the spicy cold noodles and my boyfriends gets some type of meat depending on his mood but it's always delicious. The guy who I'm assuming is the normal server (who's name I should learn) is effing wonderful, he's really wonderful and makes us always feel really welcome and is very knowledgeable. Also the free ice cream at the end is life, mango & lychee? Yes please."}
{"text":"Love it here. Miso Ribeye is my favourite, surprisingly juicy and tender, totally worth 20 bucks!"}
{"text":"Ordered the cold tofu, miso rib eye and spicy pork for dinner tonight... yum! The spicy pork is deliciously spicy ... gonna try the regular and compare. My kid won't eat spicy yet."}
{"text":"Great service! The staff is very welcoming. The food is tasty! Miso ribeye is a must try! We tried the Kalbi fries, seaweed soup, cold tofu and all the sides, everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Dynamite chicken, bulgogi tacos, and chicken katsu were very delicious! Love the atmosphere and culture of the restaurant. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We visited here for the first time and the place is very nice inside and the server Jayden was very nice and very knowledgeable with the menu and he recommended the Dynamite Chicken and we also had recommended the Fried Calamari it was very tasty, we would definitely recommend this place, the prices are good not to pricey the place is very nice and definitely will come back and visit."}
{"text":"Cute little mom & pop place with amazing food! It's not your traditional Korean BBQ with grills on the table - you order off the menu and they bring it to your table cooked. The menu is somewhat limited but everything was tasty and fresh. The bulgogi, kalbi, dumplings and dynamite chicken were all delicious. They even gave us a sample of the Hawaiian frost which was a nice treat. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good Korean food, and the workers are very polite. Clean, not a huge restaurant. But that's the way I like places."}
{"text":"Finally a Korean food nearby! Great food, great service! The staff was so friendly and prompt service, definitley coming again! I love the side dishes and the chicken wing!"}
{"text":"Warm and inviting staff. Excellent fresh food, poke melted in your mouth and spiced just right. The miso soup is the best I have ever had, very flavorful. Clean and comfortable seating and reasonably priced. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Food was super yummy. Portions were huge and prices were very reasonable (we went in with a Groupon, and had to really try hard to spend the full amount). Staff was friendly and attentive. They are new and seemed like they were still working out the kinks of service, though. The kitchen was slow, even though it was not overly crowded, which is the only reason they didn't get full 5 stars. We loved it though, and we absolutely plan on going back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch for the first time this afternoon.  First negative was the lunch menu was so damn limited.  I'm Korean so I like my soups, there was literally 1 choice, tofu seafood soup, so that was my order by default.  So here comes my second negative, I ask the waitress for the soup to be mild & she said there was no choice for spice level, most other Korean places can accommodate the spice level but not here.  Third negative was the portion size was way too small, even for lunch.  My tofu soup came in a 3 inch round crock, it was so dang small for $10.99.  And the 3 measly banchan (side dishes) they served were literally pea sized amounts.  The soup tasted so so, but definitely not something I would order again.  I was so disappointed after having read so many 5 star reviews on yelp as this place was closer to 1 maybe 2 stars.  Were these just a bunch of fake reviews on yelp???"}
{"text":"Came by here about a week after their official opening. Drawn here due to the cute mascot they had :)

My friend and I ordered seafood pancake, the cold tofu and a specially ordered vegetarian bimbimbap loco moco (they even threw in some extra veggies since this was mainly a meat dish). Everything was was delicious, including the small side dishes they served alongside our meal. My favorites were definitely the cold tofu appetizer, the complimentary seaweed soup and the stewed beef side dishes.

Super friendly service made it feel like I was eating at a friend's house :)

Definitely check this place out for good food at excellent prices!"}
{"text":"Dynamite chicken is my favorite

everything is good


Jayden, our server was funny and nice HAHA"}
{"text":"Our first time here. So happy a Korean restaurant opened this side of town. We ordered bulgogi tacos, loco moco and chadol dish. Our favorite was the loco moco, spicy and tasty. Can't wait to come back and try other things!"}
{"text":"Tried the Dynamite chicken and spicy Korean noodles. Food was very good. Would like to go back and try a hot noodle dish. Owner is friendly. Received two complimentary ice creams which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"First time here and didn't come with any expectation.  It is a nice neighborhood Korean eatery and a pub.  We tried a few items and all good and it is on par with other places we have frequent.  The Korean Wings is a must try but our order was on the extreme salty side and we couldn't finish.  Services was good and staff friendly.  I will repeat to explore other items."}
{"text":"I've always been on the lookout for the best Korean restaurants in town. Being of Korean descent it's hard to find food that's comparable to my moms cooking. However, this place hits that mark. The go to is definitely the kalbi, hands down-very flavorable. The portion is a good size even for the price. The staff is amazing. They provide friendly excellent customer service and the establishment is clean. This is definitely my favorite Korean restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today for early dinner with the wife.  Super clean modern interior greeted us.  The staff greeted us immediately and seated us.  The staff was very friendly and patient when we asked questions.  The food came out fairly quickly.  We ordered fried dumplings and kimchi seafood pancake for appetizers.  My kimchi pancake was big enough for dinner by itself.  Both were very good.  We ordered a variety of entrees to really experience Korean food.  We ordered Beef Bibimbap loco moco ( wife, as she does not like anything g with kimchi), stir fried spicy squid, pork belly with veggies.  Entrees came with rice, soup and the assorted Korean pickled veggies, which included kimchi, fish cake, black bean, apple salad, pickled root of some type.  Everything was top notch tasty and fresh.

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"We actually found this little place on Groupon and after some cross-referencing, we discovered they had a soft opening special... free beer and fries! We asked if we could use the Groupon and still take advantage of the free beer and fries special, and they said yes. Score!

We each got a pint of possibly-draft Asahi and a small basket of fries with some non-spicy mayo concoction while we looked at the menu. Menu seemed to be made up of a variety of street food and fusion items. Staff were super friendly although you could tell they were still learning. They were very attentive and refilled our banchan as we were running low. The interior was modern and there were K-pop videos playing on multiple TVs except one, which was playing some crime drama.

Unfortunately they were out of chicken gizzards but all the other food we got was delicious and definitely satisfied our hunger. The Kimchi Jjigae had a good amount of spice and plenty of substance. It was much more filling than it looked! In hindsight, it was probably not a good idea to have it with the beer though, but who can say no to free beer!? The cold tofu was colorful and tasty, but it seemed like a small-ish portion for the price. The Korean Style Omelette was simple yet the flavours were all there. So much deliciousness packed into it!

As we were heading out, they offered us some complimentary ice cream, which had some great flavors to choose from. We ended up picking chocolate coconut and lychee. Will definitely return to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Clean, great service from Edwin, good prices, and delicious food. This place is a definite for a repeat visit. Mom is visiting from Korea and gave her stamp of approval on the eel dish, and the bulgogi bibimbop was delicious and super filling."}
{"text":"First time here, and not gonna lie gonna come back! 
Soyo was busy as fuck but we found this gem on yelp and my god their food was spectacular!

We shall come back and try other things but got the ddokboki
Kalbi
Brisket
And loco moco bibimbap
Unfortunately I do not have pictures as everything was devoured"}
{"text":"They keep changing their prices, within a month price went up from $8 to $10 for chicken katsu. 
I wanted to place a phone order and the guy just told my it's $18 for chicken katsu curry. ??? Lame!"}
{"text":"Birthday Dinner was a beautiful success:

The customer service was great, a good medium of not being overwhelming while still remembering that you're there. The wautresses were also very helpful in suggesting food items to order, explaining the homemade side dishes, and other useful details like those. 

The interior was clean, comfortable, trendy tables, TVs playing Kpop/US News/etc, and overall a step up from some Korean sit down resturaunts I've been to.

Best part was hands down the food, things on the menu might seem limited and pricey but in all actuality it's worth the price paid. The miso beef with pickled onions were a nice sweet contrast to the spicy squid, while the deep fried chicken with spicy mayo and sweet chili were a whole new taste! The soup that came with the meal reminded me of a Filipinl soup called nilaga, and it really waa a nice gentle flavlor in comparison to the explosions from every dish on thr table.

Definately would come back again!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Korean Popcorn Chicken in Las Vegas! #DynamiteChicken   

Kimchi pancake nice and crispy.

Pork belly grilled to perfection.  

Side are nice proportions.  

Meals also served with soup 

Will return!"}
{"text":"Great food and exceptional service (thanks Edwin)! This place was a little hard to find but its in the Target Shopping Center right next to Foodruckers. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"So less than three weeks later they raised their prices by $3 a dish , this adds up and makes it a lot less affordable. Also the service wasn't as welcoming. Such a quick turn around for less than a month and a very hefty price increase. I'm a little but disappointed now, and sadly I won't return as frequently 




So impressed with this place. It's new and it is amazing yet reasonably priced. The service is also amazing. They are so kind! Tried the miso rib eye , pork belly and dynamite chicken. All dishes were phenomenal! Tasty and affordable. I truly hope this place does well because I will for sure be back! Thank you for the great food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Love the food. If you like Korean food then give it a try. Form your own opinions. Its more than good enough to make my family returning guests."}
{"text":"My friends and I shared a great meal at Gangnam street. The Kimchi stew and cold tofu were our favorites and we can't wait to come back and try more items. The owners and staff were also very lovely and warm. They made the experience 100x better for us and make Gangnam street stand out."}
{"text":"Good stuff

Bilogi nachos very good
Bilogi tacos were my favorite.
Loco moco not as good to as other dishes.

K Pop  playing on 3 large screens - pretty fun!!

Check it out - nice addition to area."}
{"text":"Saturday night & so excited to take my niece here... pull up and it is \"CLOSED. Sorry for the inconvenience.\" No reason. Total bummer!"}
{"text":"This place is everything! You seriously won't find better chicken wings. I got addicted and ordered five days in row their Korean wings. The stuff is super sweet and nice as well."}
{"text":"I came here with three other people. We ordered the miso steak, spicy rice cake, and soy glazed chicken wings. It was enough food for all four of us. I think the chicken here is much better than bonchon- much more flavorful. When you order a riced dish you get a soup as well. I think it's some type of soy bean paste soup. It was really good. If u write a review and show them, you can get 10% off your bill! Would definitely come back again to try other things."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service with a smile!  We had the fried chicken wings which were superb-- crispy with a sweet sauce.  The kim chi was home made which means it contains a blend of interesting tastes. Well seasoned, the other side dishes were pretty good. The nyangmyung was very good and the radish kim chi broth was quite unique and delicious.  We are coming back soon. BTw there is plenty of parking which makes it really nice"}
{"text":"Very Impressive Korean Pub located in the Southwest Area.  Service is awesome, Food portion is worth it. Definitely worth coming back.  I recommend the Eel Bowl and Tonkatsu Bowl.  I rate them a Five Star!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Except one word? DELICIOUS. I ordered the kalbi short ribs and the chicken katsu, while my friend ordered the tonkatsu and the dynamite chicken. Wow. Everything was saturated in flavor. It tasted like the all the meat was carefully marinated with just the right amount of flavor. I highly recommend the dynamite chicken as your start. It sets the tone for the rest of the meal. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The korean fried chicken was out of this world and the servers are over the top accommodating and friendly. Definitey recommend. Great pricing too!"}
{"text":"I usually wait 2-3 months before trying a new restaurant. Gangnam Street didn't disappoint.  The food is very tasty.  We only got the Korean chicken wings and miso ribeye.  Both are great dishes.  The wings is not spicy but cooked perfectly- crispy and moist.  Ribeye is cooked medium and seasoned great.  The owner of the place gave us a free dessert so we can try the Hawaiian treat- we choose the chocolate/coconut ice cream treat- it tasted like Ted's bakery famous chocolate haupia pie but in an ice cream.  Will definitely come back and will recommend to our friends."}
{"text":"First time here, food is amazing as well as service. I came here with my coworkers table of 10. The bill almost $200. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite small Korean restaurant. Came in here by myself and the server made me feel very welcomed. He suggested the calamari and said it was good so I tried it and it definitely was. I also tried the soju cocktail and I love it. It's soju topped off with beer and a flavor of mango, strawberry, peach or green apple. Very refreshing and strong, well I'm a small person so it was strong for me at least lol. Also had the pork belly and it came with sides, was not disappointed. The server checked on me the right amount of times. Will definitely come back here multiple times."}
{"text":"Kimchi Seafood Pancake is on point, could be a bit crispier like the one from Itaewon but it was good! We didnt really care for the loco moco bibimbap. Nice ambience and Cass is always good, could be colder but overall it was pretty good!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was quick. This place is very clean and cute!! Nice place for an intimate dinner."}
{"text":"This place just opened, but the atmosphere is exactly what this area is missing: a Korean fusion restaurant with beer and soju. I ordered the beef curry and it was delicious. Tastes just like my moms cooking for only $8!
Unbeatable value"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Korean fusion! Yummy!
Friendly staff and great service. 

Gangnam beef special....beef Tataki!"}
{"text":"Was skeptical about Korean Fusion , but I'm sold. Spicy Pork Belly is a must have. Great customer service. Try a few main dishes and share."}
{"text":"This place is pricey, but its worth every penny!
Not a fancy place with the prices you pay that are comparable at other fine restaurants. Just a casual dining in & out kinda place. Preparation of food is similar to Korean food prepared in Hawaii...onolicious!! \m/"}
{"text":"They tried to auto gratuity 18 percent on my party of 4. Not even hotel restaurants do that unless is 6 or more. This place is overpriced."}
{"text":"My husband and I took a walk and decided to stop in for a bite. Of course, we were under-dressed in gym clothes lol. But it was actually busy. We were immediately greeted, seated, and asked what we wanted to drink. The restaurant is pretty nice on the inside. Perfect to take a date. There are TVs all over the place, some with sports on and others playing different K-pop music videos. I love it when a restaurant plays authentic music from their country. The menu was small but had great choices. Each dish came with a biwl of rice, soup, and at least 5 different types of kimchi. The chopsticks were silver, the glasses were metal- very posh. The Cucumber kimchi was our favorite. I ordered the Spicy Tacos which were 3 fist-sized tacos on flour tortillas with carne asada in a spicy sauce. It was pretty good! My husband ordered the Spicy Bulgogi. He felt that it was just way too saucy and that the portion was very small. But he didn't dislike it, I think he just expected something else and he is used to getting big portions. 

When we were there, they kicked off their first night of Karaoke! They have very thick song books, a huge monitor where the words were displayed, and 2 microphones. It was actually a lot of fun!!! I think the owners were there bc even after we paid and stayed to participate in Karaoke, we were offered free desert (shaved ice by Aloha Company), were offered free beer, and even offered us Sake. It was just a really cool environment that actually caused people in the restaurant to interact. We were strangers until Karaoke happened, then it seemed like everyone in the restaurant became friends! 

I definitely would go back and try other dishes. Plus, would go back for Karaoke! 

We were served with smiles!"}
{"text":"Came in today and talked to the unnis, they were pretty nice and welcoming you with big smiles! I tried the tonaktsu today and it was good, it wasn't too dry, greasy or fatty. I'll try the loco moco next time and maybe I get addicted to come here whenever! Omg!"}
{"text":"I ordered Kalbi and Bulbolgi and it was fantastic. The service was impeccable. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Such great service and friendly staff! The Gangnam beef was amazing! We also had the dumplings (fried) and the kimchi and spam rice. Everything was good! The server was so sweet and made good suggestion."}
{"text":"What a lovely place! Excellent service, delicious food and great beverages!! The bulgogi burger was an amazing surprise! Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for filling food and good cocktails."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I wanted a new place close to home for my Korean fix, and this hit the spot. The first thing to hit the table after I ordered was some really delicious soup, and the quality of thier side dishes was excellent- always a good sign. The chapjae was great, and the bibimbap loco moco was great too! Not to mention the service. I've never seen staff so friendly, accommodating, and timely- from the server, Nancey, to the chef herself. A+"}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you how horrible my experience was, I'm a server myself and so I usually give aaalllloooottttt of room for mistakes. My patience was tested here and I just wanted to leave after the neglect, the unapologetic service, annoying television with horrible taste of music videos, and the food. On a date with my husband, ready to eat a good meal, and being teased by the unknown amount of time they literally dropped food off at our table to find out \"oops not yours\" and take it away repeatedly. I couldn't look at the server at this point, I wanted to pay whatever my bill was and runnnnnn out without eating but my husband was keeping me entertained. I couldn't even get water, my husband had to get up to grab the bottle for us. Our food took 40 minutes, entree before appetizer, then the rice, not enough sides. And another app came out at the end when we were signing the bill. Lol we forgot about it completely so they took it off our bill. Neighbor was complaining they were missing their short ribs  and a few other orders and how it's been 45 minutes. I'm sure it was on our table. They tried to make it better with ice cream. This place left such a bad taste in my mouth, I don't think I will be returning. I'm just going to stick with Hobak Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"OMG, probably one of the worst Korean restaurant I've ever been to.  First off you can ONLY order lunch menu, I mean wat kind of restaurant that doesn't allow you to order other items on the menu. There is a dinner 5:30-8:30pm menu and late dinner menu.. that's just straight out stupid!!

The food took sooo long to come out (40mins.) and there was just 4 tables.  I don't mind waiting for good food to come out in this case it's just NOT good.  ONLY 3 side dishes given during lunch hrs. 

I ordered LA Galbi (2pcs) was so damn chewy, my mouth was hurting after eating the beef.  The flavor wasn't bad though. The beef bulgogi was just alright and the worst was the seafood tofu soup,  so bland(even I make it better at home) 

Overall they offered to waive my bill but I decline cuz I got a Groupon and wasn't planning on coming back. 
 
The two ladies server was very nice and kept apologizing."}
{"text":"I've been searching for a Korean restaurant that served meat jun. I came across this location after seeing meat jun on yelp in their photos. When I got there I was told that their menu has changed a lot. I was really bummed but we decided to give it a try. Their food wasn't bad just not good enough for me to come back. I was also excited to eat the corn cheese but honestly it tasted spoiled. And it's pretty pricey.

I loved the service there though! Edwin was our server and he was extremely friendly with great service. The owner/cook was also super nice and has great service too!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food! plus the servers are very nice and friendly! The prices are also very good. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for quality Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good and scratches the itch for Korean fare. The pancake was very heavily kimchi flavored which I'm ok with but not the wife. The bulgogi is slightly above average but the service is better than most Korean restaurants I've been to between LA, Bay and LV. The wings were probably the highlight of the meal for me."}
{"text":"Food was good. A bit over priced. Almost everything is spicy but if you used to korean food than that's not a big problem. They use the same red chili sauce in most of those spicy foods also. Might come back."}
{"text":"It's my second time here and the food is awesome! The flavors are strong and unique unlike a lot of other places I've been to. I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"They changed menus and got rid of all the items that I went there for... I've decided to try other Korean restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place!
I'm sad it's not open Any more. 
Come back!
We miss you!
Great food,  great prices and we ate here weekly"}
{"text":"The customer service here was awesome! Our server was super sweet and perfect with keeping up on us. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing, and the food was great! My udon soup was a little sweeter than I expected, but still good!"}
{"text":"The food was great, had the bulgogi.  Since it was it my first time here I usually try something that every place will have, just to make sure they can do it right...and this place definitely did. I also had the spicy wings, which are a must try.  Can't wait for my next trip out to Vegas to come back here."}
{"text":"Cheesy Corn, Pork Belly and Kalbi are amazing.  Food comes out quickly and best part is you don't smell like BBQ when you leave."}
{"text":"Stupid me thought it would be a great idea to come in 40 minutes before closing. 
The owner was so sweet and allowed us to dine in anyways. He explained the menu to us and gave us some amazing customer service.
I forgot to ask for his name but he was quite charming and funny. 
I was a bit surprised to see that one other couple was dining in because I thought it would be a bit busier. Despite the TV playing, I felt like I was dining awkwardly and silently. 
My sister and I ended up ordering the Tonkatsu and the Bulgogi tacos. We also had some side dishes but the kimchi definitely stuck out to me. 

Overall, the Bulgogi tacos was our favorite. 
The owner also offered us Hawaiian frost, one coffee flavored and the other melon flavored. 
I'll be sure to come in earlier next time."}
{"text":"almost nothing about this place was good they are not sure what they are and they certainly aren't serving good food the fusion that they are trying to do doesn't work however they were very nice I will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Good food good device I recommend to every one. I ordered miso ribeye taste good and tender side dish is good too. Over all it is suerb"}
{"text":"Great Korean place near where we lived. Ordered the Kalbi, Dynamite Chicken, and Bulgogi! There were 3 of us and we enjoyed their food. Prices were fair. Jayden our server made everything worthwhile! We had free ice cream too! Got the Lychee flavor and my husband got the Mango. Over all, good food, good ambience. would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service very good food. Love this place and will come back again. We had the bulgogi, spicy side pork, spicy tofu and the brisket. Everything was delicious. They gave us water refills without asking and both our server and bus persons were pleasant people. The place is very clean."}
{"text":"Beef bibibap! Yummy I would definitely recommend. Do the special . Much yum . 

Honestly it's really really good you should come here. Amazing the prices are pretty good"}
{"text":"Food is REALLY GOOD. Loved  the crispy anchovy  and the kalbi. Loved the chicken drumstick appetizer... So crispy.  The owner Mr Lee and server  Edward are the best! Will definately come back and being friends."}
{"text":"They are open on sundays even though the sign says otherwise. Server was super polite and welcomed us in, and it's super clean!!!

Post meal conclusion: My picture does this place no justice. Kalbi was super juicy, dynamite chicken perfect and wasn't drenched in sauce to make it taste good, and the Korean wings was glazed better than BWW! The sides tasted way better than places found on Spring Mountain. 

I highly recommend and do plan on being a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Korean food close by! Really good! Big portions! Definitely will come back! Wish they had more things on the menu.."}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars. 

The food was great. Authentic and nice spicyness. Bonchon was a little different with edamame and potatoes, but it still also had the usual radish and kimchi. We also were given a complimentary tofu soup. Our main dishes included the rice and fish cake platter, the spicy beef, and the bulgogi salad (forgive me for not knowing the actual Korean dish names). Add in some rare apple soju and I had a great time. The rice cakes were superb and the spicy beef was also a hit. Customer service was exceptional and they were always refilling our glass or bringing us more soju to keep the good times going. 

I really hope this place stays open so that there's good Korean in Summerlin and you don't have to go to Spring Valley or China Town for the goods. I wish they were open pst midnight on weekends and/or had a Happy Hour as Korean food is typically more expensive than other late night foods, but still the plates were large and I had a good time. I will be back."}
{"text":"It was our first time here on Saturday. Call before you go just to make sure they are open. They are still in their soft opening phase I believe...? They will be closed randomly and the info on here isn't correct. 
Anyways, I am usually picky when getting Korean food that isn't BBQ because I can have my mom or family make it. We ordered the kimchi seafood pancake, which I don't think was worth the $15 but it was still yummy LOL. Bulgogi tacos were good, can't go wrong with chicken katsu, and the miso rib eye is a MUST! They give you rice and radish soup too along with side dishes. The service was great, granted there was only another couple in there with us, but still....great service! My daughter got a free ice cream on the way out lol which she loved and they brought out spicy kimchi noodles for us to try as well!  mmmm I'm getting hungry now. Lol we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Work across the street from them! Me and my coworkers always order their dynamite chicken.. and it is the besttttt!!! The ladies are super nice in there and love the Asian music videos they play in there!"}
{"text":"Nice Korean place! Spicy Bulgogi has got quite a bit of kick as the name suggests, but was still really good. Atmosphere is nice and modern, and I was pleasantly supported they had NCAA tournament games on."}
{"text":"New restaurant in our neighborhood.   Good service and food.  Bulgogi was very tasty. Attempting to try more small locally owned restaurants."}
{"text":"One word: YUMMY! So glad that there's a good Korean restaurant in this area. We've been to the other ones on the southwest and they're just not that good. But this one is! We tried their pork belly and tonkatsu. Both my son's favorite! If he approves then you know it's good. He says this place has the best tonkatsu.  I really liked the pork belly. It's grilled with veggies and seasoned perfectly! I should've taken pictures before but everything looked so delicious we just dove right in!"}
{"text":"Tried Gangnam Street for lunch for the first time today, and we're glad we did. Food was awesome and the service (Sarah and Munshu) was just as good! Would return soon to try the tripe dish next time, since I didn't see it on their specials board until after ordering my delicious bulgogi meal."}
{"text":"the food was AMAZING and their customer service is on point!! ordered the dynamite chicken, corn cheese, and bulgogi nachos"}
{"text":"Delicious food, super SUPER nice service. 

We got the poke, korean chicken wings, miso and kimchi soups. Everything was solid but my favorites were the soups and banchan. They even accommodated me on my order since I don't eat beef and were so attentive through the whole meal. 

This place is perfect if you're craving korean food but don't want to do AYCE bbq."}
{"text":"This place used to be Aranya Thai Bistro, sitting in between Fuddruckers and Mad Hatter Cupcakes at the Grand Canyon Parkway retail hub, and is close to Flamingo Road, 215 and Hualapai Way.

We came in for an early dinner today. There are huge 4 or 5 big screen TVs that were playing Korean Pop music videos which is very entertaining to watch.

Appetizers include steamed or fried dumplings, corn cheese,\" Tofu soup, etc.

We tried their house sake and they also serve Soju, imported Korean beer and a limited wine selection including \"Walmae Makgeolli\" Korean rice wine. 

After you order, the server brings you 5 mini plates of various pickled vegetables such as edamame, kimchi, seaweed etc

We ordered a medium spicy Chicken wings. Then we had Bulgogi Tacos and Bulgogi Noodle which were pretty delicious and spicy. The noodle dish had a very unique taste and I loved it. 

The service was great.

We will def. be back and try other more items on the menu. It looked interesting and tasty!

We also got two mini Hawaiian Frost when we checked in and they were so delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food. Definitely order the bulgogi tacos. You won't find this great of food and drinks for this inexpensive anywhere around Vegas. The staff is extremely welcoming and really attentive. A+ would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"It was our first time being here and it was such an amazing experience. The staff was so friendly and nice. We ordered the cheese corn, bulgogi nachos, and the dynamite chicken. Wow, I cannot explain how good they were. As we were getting ready to pay the lady said they took 10% off our bill. So our bill was only $20. They took off the cheese corn and the extra rice that we had ordered. And they also gave us complement ice cream. Hands down the best service we've ever gotten. And we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, Best service I've had in a long time. Granted we were their first customers but they went out of their way to get us coffee from a coffee shop next door because we don't like instant coffee lol! The older man was like oh! We can go and get if for you. 

Experience was one to remember, great noodles, great appetizer, 20pct discount for Military!!! 

:D"}
{"text":"Wow!  The spicy bulgogi is wonderful and the serving size  won't disappoint.  I'll be back, possibly tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Jayden is the guy to see when you are here! Always nice to talk to and very helpful! Ribeye cubes and bulgogi nachos!"}
{"text":"Another new place opened in my area! The place is fun with korean music videos playing the whole time, the service is great, and the food is fun! Korean hawaiian fusion!! The bibimbap loco moco was so good and the portion is huge! Also tried the cold tofu which is tasty with the tempura crunch. This place is so good, I went back 2 days later and brought 3 new friends!!"}
{"text":"Lovely Service. I came for the gizzards but it's off the menu. But spicy pork belly is good. Chicken wings crispy. And the beef special was unctuous!"}
{"text":"My Korean wife and I were very impressed with everything we ate.  Fried squid, Bibimbap, and wings were terrific. Service was also excellent"}
{"text":"Just what Vegas needed.  A good mix of authentic and fusion Korean food that go perfectly with your soju and beer.  Great, honest service.  Clean. The banchan (korean side dishes) and stew are better than most Korean restaurants. Sooo good.  You can tell they have a good Korean cook, just by trying their banchan.  Really hit the spot.  This pub and kitchen is perfect for a meal and pregame before your Vegas night out."}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious! We started with the bulgogi tacos, which I hadn't intended on eating until they came out. They looked so good I couldn't help but take one. For our entrees we indulged in the beef curry rice and the beef bibimbap loco mocco. 

Service was also fantastic. The waitresses were very attentive and super sweet. We'll definitely be back; excited to see how this place grows."}
{"text":"Right off that bat the atmosphere is calm and the place looks trendy and clean. We found our seats and were automatically helped. The owner welcomed us and a waiter came to take our orders.
We ordered Japchae, dynamite chicken, bugolgi bibimbap, and chicken Katsu. All the food was good and you'll see the review of each dish with their pictures. 
The service was great and not to mention coming to any restaurant with 2 kids is hard but the staff was accommodating. Our waiter gave us scissors to cut the Japchae so it was easier to eat. They gave all of us ice cream even though we didn't order and the courtesy was off the roof! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! Yummy yummy spicy noodles, marinated beef dish (I can't pronounce the names lol)... we got the #2 combo to share along with the \"dynamite chicken\" drizzled in some type of sauces with a house made dip. The owner was kind enough to grab us iced coffee next door which I thought was super sweet, above and beyond the expectations of phenomenal service. Mind you, we got there at 11am before anyone else so we were the highlight upon opening, or that's what they made us feel like anyway. Edwin was our server and he was very attentive to our needs, with a smile on his face at all times! Will definitely be back for my spicy Asian cravings"}
{"text":"My first visit here and the food and service was great. We had the bibimbap, Bulgogi and the Jap Chae, all were very tasty. Edwin (our server) was friendly and very attentive I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had in a long time. 
Terrible service. 
Ordered nachos that came out looking and tasting like ballpark nachos...jarred jalapeños, cheese wiz, and generic chips. Half of the nachos were cold and the other half hot, it was so strange. And $14!!!!! 
Wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't so overpriced."}
{"text":"Great customer service and food. I recommend this place with all my soul. I brought my parents and they were satisfied so much."}
{"text":"For several years, I traveled to Korea regularly for business.  During those visits, I got to know both the people and the food fairly well.  The people are gracious and welcoming, and the food is remarkable to say the least. It is fresh, healthy, and full of wonderful flavors and textures.  There is no other cuisine quite like it anywhere in the world. 

Once my travel came to an end, I quickly discovered that quality Korean fare is very difficult to find in the US.  Over the last few years, I have eaten at Korean establishments from D.C. to San Diego, and have yet to find a place that sent me back to the busy streets of Seoul.  That is, until last night when I chanced upon Gangnam Street.  

Gangnam, if you are not aware, is much more than a trendy song from a guy that dances funny.  It is an upscale area in the center of Seoul full of shopping, dining, and a big chunk of the South Korean entertainment industry.  Like the rest of Seoul, it is a bustling high energy area full of people.  I worked and stayed in this area many times, so when I saw Gangnam Street tucked in modestly next to Fuddruckers my interest immediately peaked. 

Over my years of traveling, I have learned that the best food in the world generally does not come from big, fancy, overpriced restaurants.  To the contrary, I have found that some of my most memorable meals came from small, out of the way, establishments where the owner is both the waiter and the cook.  Their menus are were not full of dishes created by consultants, but rather recipes that were handed down through generations of their family.  They are not so much making you a meal as they are offering you a part of their life. The minute I walked into Gangnam Street, I could tell that it was one of these places.

The restaurant is small, but well appointed and very clean.  You can tell they take great pride in their establishment. The owner came out to talk to me when I came in, and happily gave me a sample of some of the best kimchi I have had anywhere.  My theory is that when you walk into an Italian eatery for the first time, you order spaghetti and meatballs.   If you don't like it, you will not like anything else they have to offer.  I have found this theory works with almost any type of fare, so the minute I tasted the owner's homemade kimchi, I knew that the food at this little joint was going to be great!   For the record I ordered the Dynamite Chicken, Kimche Pancakes, Chap Jae (Korean noodles), and bulgogi nachos.  In addition to my order, the owner supplied me with a healthy portion of their delicious kimchi and nice selection of banchan (Korean side dishes).

The kimchi pancake was tender with crispy edges and was accompanied by a delicious sauce that had just enough spice to give it a lovely kick.  The noodles were fresh and accompanied with a lovely selection of mushrooms, vegatables, beef, and peppers. The Dynamite Chicken was crispy, perfectly cooked, and came with a nice spicy mayo and sweet pepper sauce. The nachos were fun and tasty as well.   Overall the quality of Gangnam's food is outstanding, and the perfectly crafted flavors instantly took me back to the alleys and side streets of Samcheongdong and Insadong.  I am already looking forward to my next visit.  

So here is my advice.  If, like me, you love small owner operated joints that put out great food, you owe yourself a trip to Gangnam Street.  Whether you are a Korean food connoisseur, or have never tried the stuff, you have my assurance that Gangnam will not disappoint. And while you are there, spend some time talking to the owner. I guarantee you will leave happily full and feeling like you have made a new friend."}
{"text":"The food was just okay and overpriced for what it is and the service needs vast improvement. Our server was nice but couldn't answer any of our questions or explain what menu items were. Definitely don't think there will be a need to go back again."}
{"text":"Chap chae was wonderful, as good as being in Korea. I cant wait to sing kaoraoke here"}
{"text":"So happy we stopped by here! The ambience is very nice and clean. There are huge big screen tvs that play Korean Pop music videos which is very entertaining haha 
To start off, we ordered the Bulgogi Tacos which is pretty amazing and spicy! I have to say this would be my favorite from what we ordered. For our entrees, we got the chicken katsu with the curry. The katsu was great but I wasn't a fan of the curry. It needed more flavor. We also ordered Chap Jae. You can't go wrong with that. It was tasty and portions were plenty. 
The mini veggie appetizers they give you in the beginning of your meal had a lot of flavor compared to other Korean restaurants in town. I def enjoyed that. They also served a side of soup and rice with your entrees which I thought was nice. The broth was delicious. 

Def want to come back and try other more items on the menu!
Also, if you check in, you get a free mini ice cream =D"}
{"text":"It was our first time here today!  Food and service were excellent, we're looking forward to trying more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best Korean style wings I've ever had an absolute must try here !!! Also the stuff is super nice and everything is super clean. Love this place"}
{"text":"First time at Gangnam Street and loved it. The Kalbi was meaty and flavorful and the service was excellent as they checked on us often to ensure our satisfaction. The dishes of my wife and son were excellent as well (noodles with beef dish and chicken katsu). The Calamari appetizer too was really good and plentiful. Facility is clean and comfortable and we're looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Small Korean Diner in Summerlin area of Las Vegas. New and clean. Serves plenty of bunchan (appetizers) before the meal. Bunchan are underwhelming and alcohol prices too expensive. I just got back from Seoul so once the entree arrives will have more to compare. Dinner salad was plain without much taste. 3 meals ordered were bibimbap, pork katsu and dynamite chicken. My wife said the food was okay, which translates from Korean \"this sucks\". If it were not for the sauce I could not have finished the katsu. My kid who is normally an eating machine never got out of first gear.
I think the star of the show would have to be the the TVs with the Kpop music! If you want good Korean food, save your $$ and drive to Spring Mountain area.
I will say the staff is very attentive and open to suggestions. Hopefully, the quality of the food will improve in the future?"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place. My mom took me there for my birthday tonight because we love to eat different foods. We had the first and third on the menu, one was LA kalbi - short rib. We couldn't eat one bite. It was $23 of gooey chewy stringy fat, I couldn't even pick the solid meat off. The third item Chap Jao or something was pretty tasty! The bulgogi in it was delicious, couldn't eat the chew fish cake in it...really wish I knew about that ingredient but it was easy to go around.

The male server was great and so was the lady working, she was not a server and not the owner so idk what role she plays but she was such a sweet lady, we loved her! As for the owners....they would not remove the price of our meal we did not like and instead made us order something else to go...I've been in the service industry for 14 years...the one time I go out, I always hope to have great service. How. Oils the owners charge us $23 still for something we didn't even take a bite of? They're a new restaurant and I was hoping they would have at least came out and apologized...instead we got dirty looks from them sitting across the room from us. Then we were so tired and cold ready to leave and had to wait 15 minutes for dumplings which turned out to be potstickers....I'm disappointed how the owners handled (I should say did not handle) the situation and will not return again."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend. Beat the dinner rush and got really good service. It's hard to be an AYCE sushi place AND an AYCE Korean BBQ place and excel at BOTH, yet this place manages to do so.

Big League delicious. 10/10 would recommend. Also I love the name."}
{"text":"This place was spur the moment dinner. My wife and I ate here for our first time tonight and I've got to say, it exceeded my expectations for a little hole in the wall joint. 

The decor is super cute, modern, and clean. The service was attentive and great. We were seated quickly. And our drink orders were taken care of asap. 

We ordered the Bulgogi Bibimbap and Bulgogi Burger. Both were very very delicious. Good portions too. 

The cook, I'm assuming, came out and checked to see how we liked everything and we thought that was very nice. Going above and beyond. He even engaged in small talk and gave us two desserts on the house. 

The only reason why I didn't give five stars, is because I thought the price for a regular Coke of $3 was kind of expensive just for a Coke, and the Bulgogi Burger bread was getting a little hard the longer it sat there on my plate. So I ate it pretty quick to avoid that. Lol. 

Other than that, I would recommend and I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"New Owners... Should've left the menu alone.

When it comes to Korean restaurants, I have my 2 go-to's: Chapchae, and the Korean pancake... They got rid of both :(

Their menu drastically changed and none of our favorites were on the menu. I was so disappointed that they got rid of my favs that I didn't even order anything except for a Korean beer,... That they were out of. I ordered another Korean beer but I didn't enjoy it as much as I would've if it was what I wanted.

Despite the great service and the friendly staff unfortunately, I think this was our last visit here."}
{"text":"At first the food didnt look that much. But when it was time to munch down the menu was on point didnt feel bloated after. Feeling was satisfiying. Wished there was more in the menu to try but overall everything was pretty yummilicous..."}
{"text":"Really great food and excellent customer service. The speciality eel dish was amazing. Will be back to try their bibimbap. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff.  Had the brisket, miso ribeye, and Gangnam beef app, all were very good but the miso ribeye was the stand out favorite.  Along with the sides to eat with the rice the meal was outstanding.  Looking forward to trying the chicken dishes next time."}
{"text":"I went into this restaurant because a close friend recommended that I try the miso ribeye and their kimchee. Tried it and it was delicious. I totally recommend the ribeye and would definitely try it again. The service was surprisingly great and fast. This restaurant is a must try with its great food."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place.  Looking around the area to get some good food and drinks.  And that's what I got.  Great place."}
{"text":"Was craving Korean food and saw this brand new restaurant and had to give it a try! Went here for the soft opening and I will definitely be back! I had bulgogi nachose, dynamite chicken, cold tofu and kalbi. All items that we ordered were amazing! Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"Creative Koreab fusion.. Ordered the Bibimbap Loco Moco, Beef Curry Rice, and Korean Wings. All very flavorful. The wings are meaty and juicy."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. We were too hungry to take pictures (sorry) but the food was very fast and the service was great! We will come back again if in the area."}
{"text":"Go for the bulgogi. Get it spicy. But proceed with caution. Deliciously hot. They can accommodate your needs on a 1-20 scale. #finetuning"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food is on par.

I was craving Soon Du Bu (steaming tofu soup) and called ahead.  Even though it is not on the menu, the server asked the kitchen and they custom made it for me. (Impressed!)

After you order, server brings you 5 plates of various pickled vegetables to snack on before you entree arrives as is typical of Korean meals.  

The Soon Du Bu arrived bubbling in a hot pot.  The chef apparently made extra and gave me the rest of the stew in a separate bowl.  Half way through my meal, a Korean server (owner?) came over with a to go container and 2 plastic bags knwoing it was going to be too much food for me to finish in one sitting (she was right.)

I asked for an extra bowl of rice to go, since I had leftovers.  She gave that to me complimentary as well to thank me for visiting the new establishment.

For $12, I had a bargained meal with exceptional service and accommodations.  I look forward to trying more things on their menu in the future."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I read the reviews here before coming.  We came on Sunday around 8:30 PM.  There was only one table seated here and left within 5 minutes after we got here.  The whole shopping is super dead after 8 PM, so I'm not surprised.  We were served pretty quickly.  

We ordered:

Hot Sake (First time ever having one that's has a yellow tint&tastes different, I'm not a fan of it)
Dynamic Chicken (best dish here)
Cold Buckwheat Noodle (fresh & light)
Bulgogi Tacos (ti was ok, nothing special)

They do have happy hour for drinks. Buy 2 get 1 starts 8:30 PM to close.  Don't forget to check in for free ice cream.  =)

Overall, great service and food is good."}
{"text":"Incredibly attentive staff and the food is amazing! We had the chap jae and bibimbap loco Moko, and not only was this superbly done but even the side dishes were especially tasty. The soup is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Chicken wings are on point. Highly recommended. Staff is friendly"}
{"text":"Jayden was our server tonight. 
And he was the most accommodating/awesome server I've had. Real genuine. 
The food is awesome! 
And don't forget to check in for a free ice cream"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Will def be coming back!  We ordered miso ribeye (a must) as well as the dukboki!  The soup was super delicious and he loco mock bibimbap! 

Everything was so pleasant from the service to the food! I recommend this place and will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and I really loved it! Food was fresh and delicious. I loved the calamari! Crispy n very fresh! Service was ! The owner often goes to the table to get some feedback. Great environment and very clean. I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner. My boyfriend enjoyed his dinner however I did not love mine. The service was average. I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Ate on the later side on a Tuesday night. 

Great food, great service. Very nice and upscale, two TVs playing KPOP and one sports. Felt like I was in Seoul. 

Tried the cheesy corn, beef curry, fried dumplings, and the firecracker(I think) chicken. All were great. Curry was favourite and the Kimchee was the best I've had in the US. 

Definitely worth going to and hope others discover this Korean gem."}
{"text":"Made in for the soft opening.  Pretty good so far.  Very clean and comfortable.  Very friendly people.  Service was great.  Best of all the prices were very reasonable.  Worth the effort."}
{"text":"I understand this is a new restaurant but the service was atrocious. I haven't wrote a review in over a year. This shows you how disappointed I would have to be to get back on yelp and post a review so people can see the truth behind all the fake reviews for this place. 
We came in on a Saturday afternoon. Place wasn't even that busy. The staff didn't even greet us or sit us down on any of the 5 unclean tables that where empty. They didn't even bother cleaning up after the customers left until I asked them nicely. 
Then we where waiting about 20 minutes for the staff to take our order and then I lost patience and asked them to help us with our order. The Korean lady nodded and then nothing for another 10 minutes! They didn't bring out banchan (Korean side dishes) until after I asked them more than half way finished with the lunch. 
I looked around and other customers where fed up and leaving without even ordering. This is a joke. 
To owner of this place: read this and hire additional trained staff, the two older women working don't even know how to ring up the register correctly. 
The only reason we didn't leave sooner after the terrible service was because we purchased a Groupon and had no choice but to use it. Fortunately the food was decent.
Beware of all the fake 5 star reviews of this place, just take a look at these people. They have less than 5 yelp connections, and less than 3 reviews on their profiles. And yes I'm calling them out."}
{"text":"Mediocre for the price. I lived in South Korea for a little while and I know good authentic Korean BBQ. This place is just a few blocks away from my house so I decided to give it a shot. The decor and environment here is very average and looks the same as any other place. 

I ordered bugagi naturally and my food was actually pretty good. They don't cook it in front of you like most authentic Korean BBQ places but that's okay. 

It took almost 30 minutes after my meal was brought out for them to bring out my fiances noodles. The owners who happened to be sitting beside us went to the kitchen and asked them to speed things up. Her food was brought shortly after. They gave us beer and desert for free for the inconvenience. I have nothing bad to say about the owners as they were very nice and friendly. 

My biggest issue with this place was the price. My fiance and I like to dine out on the weekends and have been to a lot of places. I don't think the quality of food or environment justifies the price here. You are looking at around $20-25 per plate. For those prices, you can go to an authentic Korean restaurant with a more traditional Korean environment and have much better food and better service. 

I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food.....AND.....excellent service provided by Edwin!!! He's very efficient and provided excellent service!! Keep it up Edwin"}
{"text":"Awesome food,service and bathrooms were clean! Edwin (server)and Ben (chef)were great!"}
{"text":"Have dinner in this place yesterday with my family and it did not disappoint us. I highly recommend this place, great food and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Great service!
Amazing food!
Comfortable environment!
Me and my kids enjoyed it there and will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"It was our first time and they did NOT disappoint! The flavor was great and the portions were a good size.

The sides were amazing! Kimchi, fish, soup so good! We got the kalbi (which was one of the best we've had) and the spicy pork belly, also very good! 

The staff was super friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our server, Edwin, was very nice and made the dinning experience wonderful. The food was excellent and the side dishes were awesome. The chef even came out to see if everything was to our satisfaction, which was a pleasant surprise. If your in the mood for Korean food and you live on this side of town, then you need to try it."}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5 than 4 due to service but the food is on point when it comes to flavor.  We really liked the dynamite chicken and the miso rib eye.  We also ordered the regular fried rice for my 1 year old, but this really lacked flavor.  The miso ribeye has a savory flavor with the miso and is paired well with the onions/citrus garnish.  The meat is also very tender.  The chicken was fried to a crispy perfection and of course sriracha mayo sauce tastes good on everything.  There was only one server for the whole restaurant, which makes sense if your not busy.  However, with six tables occupied, service was a little lacking. Also, the server's English was not very good.  Later on I realized he was not trying to sell us soup, but wanted to know if we wanted the soup that came with the meal.  Also, I asked for a cup of hot water and he said it was not available.  I had to kindly suggest if he can just microwave some hot water for me.....For people with younger kids, they do not have high chairs.  We did use a Groupon on our first visit and the waiter kind of laughed when the bill came back and it was less than $10 afterwards.  We tipped generously on the full amount of the bill, but maybe advise your servers not to laugh at the use of Groupons.  The point of a Groupon is to bring people in and try your food....  We came and we enjoyed the food, so we will definitely be back since there are not too many good Korean options in the area.  But Gangnam step up your service!"}
{"text":"Found on Groupon and was nicely surprised on how tasty the entrees and all the sides were. Enjoyed the marinated ribs and ribeye. So yummy. Entrees served with 5 sides of  daikon, octopus, marinated white fish, kimchi and delightful marinated finely sliced potatoes. Also served with sticky white rice, crispy white fish, delicious miso or tofu soups and a small salad. So much food but the entrees were the best. Service excellent by Edward. It wasn't busy at 7:00 but it started to fill up around 8:00. The dinner also comes with choice of sorbets which were very sweet. We didn't have room to do anything more then to just taste. I wasn't excited about the sorbets. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. The KimChee is fabulous not too spicy like other KBBQ places I have been to recently!
Try the Korean BBQ short ribs yum!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Gangnam Street a try since they have new owners so I was curious to see what they have to offer. Our waiters name was Edwin, His service was Great! But for food wise from what they serve now it's not amazingly great enough to have me coming back. I wouldn't recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Food and Soju are good! We had Kimchy pancake (my favorite), Korean style wings, Kimchy fried rice and beef curry rice. Our waiter, Jayden, was great! He also gave us good tips on where to buy Korean skin care products."}
{"text":"Service was great, almost too great! My friend and I were seated and he served just waited next to us waiting for us to order haha so we had to tell her a few times to give us a minute since it was our first time here. The prices are $$ but the food was mediocre in my opinion. We got the chicken wings and they were so sticky and \"molasses-y\" that it was unenjoyable, we constantly had to pick out the gooey Wong dressing/skin from our teeth and it was just sweet and didn't really have the depth of flavor that you typically see with Korean style BBQ wings. We also got the pork with kimchi and tofu which took the longest to prepare, which is fine, but it wasn't what I was expecting when you typically think of Korean style Pork (usually square slices of pork belly) and sautéed kimchi (should be more smoky and caramelized), with tofu on the side. We also got spicy squid stir fry which was probably the best thing we ordered, the squid was cooked well and OT over/under cooked and it was (a good) spicy! Veggies were crisp and had good texture in the dish. I probably won't drive out of my way to come here again and stick to my \"go-to\", Soyo."}
{"text":"We're so glad that we found that place. Somewhat hip Korean bistro with great food and an enticing happy hour deal on alcohol. How can you go wrong? I love the beef kalbi. So tender and flavorful. Also their noodle menu is something you don't find anywhere. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Still love this place! The manager/owner is still super friendly and made all the banchans himself this morning! Love love love this place-all fresh-all home made! Yummmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"My family and I found this place a couple month ago. we've been back a few times ever since. Food was amazing and the service was excellent. 
Galbi & Bulgogi is my favorite. They serve on hot plate and it always gives \"impressive taste of finish\"! A meal here never disappoints."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean and nice looking inside and the service was very friendly and made the effort to go above and beyond. 
I ordered the bulgogi tacos which came as three small tacos with the bulgogi and coleslaw. The taste was delicious but as someone with no spice tolerance, the coleslaw about killed me it had such a kick to it! The other people at the table agreed it was spicy but weren't complaining. Thankfully the waiter saw my struggle and gave me a complimentary Hawaiian frost, which saved that day. The other dishes we order were the tonkatsu which was good, but nothing special, and the cold noodle which wasn't as good. After dinner we used the yelp check in to get a round of Hawaiian frost. 

Overall the meal was only alright but the service rounded the review to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Friendly, easy parking and terrific kimchi!  We came early in the evening and had the place to ourselves.  We shared the fried dumpling appetizers -- generous serving and delicious.  Loved the little dishes (seaweed, fish cake, and squid) that came out before the meal.  My bibimbap was very good and my partner's pork belly and vegetables was even better.  The food was NOT too sweet -- something I hate in many Korean restaurants.  I wish they had a full bar and opened for lunch -- especially on the weekends."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  Place is clean and modern.  Everyone is friendly.  The food is delicious.  Used a groupon and got more than its worth.  Got jap chae (which says bulgogi glass noodles on the menu), dumplings and seafood soup (soon do bu) and some ramen to go.  I wouldn't mind coming back here and paying full price."}
{"text":"I would give this place 6 stars if I could. I recommend the kalbi and the bulgogi. Super nice place and nice people!!!

Where are you now Master Chef???  We need your amazing food!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what it is. Food wasn't anything amazing. I order chicken teriyaki for $10, I received a plate of chicken which was tasty but small for the price. I was told they changed the menu a few months back, no more bulgogi nachos, or other things I've seen in other Yelp reviews."}
