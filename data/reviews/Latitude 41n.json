{"text":"I should have gotten a hot dog.  My boyfriend and I were headed to Happy Dog, but at the last moment I decided I just didn't feel like a hot dog. So across the street we went to Latitude 41 N.    After being handed menus, we were already uneasy about our decision. The menu makes no sense. There are bar-appropriate appetizers, salads, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, burgers and breakfast. Oh, and smoothies were advertised on a chalkboard on the wall. I already knew this place would be bad since they didn't seem to specialize in anything. How could they execute well if there is such a broad (un)focus?   We ordered the artichoke bake appetizer, chopped salad and southwest quesadillas. I also ordered a mocha smoothie.  Artichoke bake: Uuuuuuuuuuuuugh. Gross. It was sorta sour, had about nine artichoke leaves in it, and had more cheese on top than anyone needs to eat in a month. My boyfriend said the cheese was choking him when he swallowed. It was served with \"crispy tortillas,\" but really they had a weird malleable cardboardy stale texture.  Chopped salad: Eeeeeeeeeeeeek. Ick. It looked slimy. It wasn't, but it looked slimy. It was shredded lettuce, tomatoes, a little bacon and a little bit of cheese. It was already mixed... I guess I like my toppings on top in a pile so I can pick up what I want in each bite. The balsamic dressing didn't taste like much. They offered seasoned bread (which I asked for but didn't eat) or fried dough. I asked what fried dough was and the girl said it was pizza dough deep fried with sugar on it served with cinnamon-sugar butter. Basically a donut, she says. WTF? Why would I want cinnamon donuts with a salad? How dumb.  Southwest quesadilla: Ehhhhhhhhhhhh. Blah.  This had no flavor. How gross is it to chew something, get it mooshy in your mouth and not even taste anything salty or greasy or meaty or anythingy??? The description said there was chorizo on it, and I saw it, but couldn't taste it.   Mocha smoothie: It tasted like a frozen international delight. Made with a powdered mocha mix. What more can I say?  This place tasted like Applebee's is it's hero.  The girls working were very nice, I can't say anything bad about them. But, we were asked if we wanted our artichoke bake first as an appetizer, which we did, and all the food came out together. Minor goof in my book.  The absolute WORST part of the experience, was the 40-minute drive home. We couldn't get home fast enough, if you know what I mean.................  Bottom line: if you have to choose between hunger and Latitude 41 N, just go hungry."}
{"text":"Went last Thursday for breakfast around 10am. 3 of us ordered breakfast and drinks. The server did not put in the diet coke...had to go back and order. My husband ordered potatoes as an extra...server forgot and he had to order again. Shouldn't of bothered, hard, tasted like they were on the grill all morning. I had pan seared oatmeal, served with fresh fruit (said the menu). Oatmeal was awesome, came with no fruit, When I asked about this server said they were out of fruit, really??? Definitely not worth the prices they charge."}
{"text":"I ate here with my sister and we had a lovely experience. We both ordered pancakes and they were delicious! I like my breakfast places to be low-key, which is exactly what this place is. You walk in and place your order at the front counter. They bring your food to you when it's ready, but in the mean time you can help yourself to water, juice or coffee sitting on a table at the front. I appreciated not being bothered every five minutes by a waitress. I would absolutely stop here again when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Husband and I just had a great meal here. Both had the Lat 41 Chix Salad Latitude Attitude. Absolutely delicious hot chicken salad in a calzone type crust. Hot yummy firies and drinks of our choice. Friendly service, no wait and a peaceful atmosphere. Have been before and will return."}
{"text":"This place offers decent food at reasonable prices. The space is inviting and the staff is friendly. My first time here ordered soup and salad combo. No bacon in salad as the menu stated but soup was tasty. I would return."}
{"text":"From the exterior I was excited to try this place, and even from the interior to start.  But then it all fell apart. Really awkward setting as far as service goes and it transcended in to the meal.  I got the crab omelet which sounded tasty, rich (probably too much for me but I couldn't find a benedict). And while the crab and omelet was decent, the potatoes ruined it all. Maybe the worst potatoes I've had from a breakfast joint EVER. . ever.  And for me, a breakfast guru, that says it all right there. I covered what I could in hot sauce and ate just enough so I knew I wouldn't have to eat when I got home.  The service was terrible. The place is awkward.   I wanted to like this place, but it failed miserably.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"As I sit here in the booth of this restaurant for breakfast I must say that this place is a hidden gem. I'd driven past here thousands of times but today was the first time I'd ever made it a point to stop in. I'm happy and mad. Happy because this place is great. Mad because it took me so long to come here. I had the mènage à trois breakfast which consists of eggs (any style), bacon, sausage, coffee, toast and hash browns or grits. All this for the low price of $4.95! And for an extra $1 you can add two additional items so I got cheese on my hash browns and a cinnamon bun French toast.  Everything came out fast and was very fresh. They way it works is you go to the counter first, order and pay, then choose where you want to sit. I love everything about this place. Great atmosphere, good music, and the breakfast is incredible, and the prices can't be beat. I will without question ,be back for another dance!"}
{"text":"Showed up for Sunday around brunch it was pretty good. I had an odd creation of ham, egg, and english muffin and few other things stacked on top of each other.The people seemed pretty nice and checked in a few times to refill water and things. This was good b/c it's set up in a Noodles & Co. style where you order at the register and then they bring it out to you so you don't really have an assigned server.They have a nice theme going of maps/geography on the place. I had way too much fun just staring down at the maps that are on the table tops (don't worry, there's a plastic sheet over it so you're not eating off of a dirty car map).Overall it was decent and worthy of mention in the neverending downtown brunch discussion of Waterstreet / Chop House / Heck's / Johnny Mango's.Word of caution. There's a speed camera somewhere in the area on Detroit as I got a nice surprise in the area a few weeks later. No way should that be a 25 zone... If that doesn't get at least 10 votes for \"useful\" I don't know what will."}
{"text":"We went last week with our family.  The staff was friendly but seemed somewhat overwhelmed.  The food selection was great - many healthy choices in the menu.  We had younger kids and teens with us, and everyone found something they liked!  We have been here on many occasions and always have a good experience!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices, comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff. I've been here a few times for breakfast and can't pass up the special: $3.95 for coffee, eggs, bacon, sausage, breakfast potatoes and toast. It's a ton of food but if somehow you can eat more, $1 will buy you 2 options from their list of sides, like a pancake or quesadilla. Not only that, but the bathrooms are clean! This place won't change your life but it will consistently provide a tasty, inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Fresh product with a fun menu. I have eaten here both for breakfast and brunch, and  both times it was fantastic! The French toast is unique, a perfect breakfast option.   I am not a huge salad eater however, the chicken cob salad is something everyone should try. The portion is huge!!!    It is a self serve and order place and can get confusing for first time customers, which leads to a long wait."}
{"text":"Had to try it. So yesterday ( Sunday ) my husband, daughter and son in law along with 2 toddlers tow finally experienced Lat41N.  I had chicken and waffles and liked it.  My son-in-law and husband ordered the Plowmans' Breakfast which had steak with it and neither one of the men could chew the steak!! Their breakfast was at least $9.00 each  and not enjoyable. Wait staff could be more friendly. Like the concept overall but improvements must be made for them to stay in business.   Don't know if well be back but always like to give everyone a second chance."}
{"text":"Such a warm dining room, ideal for meeting up with a friend or catching up on your work. Free wifi, makes it a nice, quiet and pleasant office space. My favorite menu item is the mac and cheese. Their salads are also quite delicious. Baked goods on the counter are often too tempting to pass up. Friendly counter-service. They also have an e-mail based reward program which you can sign-up for from your phone while dining or once you get home. I have yet to try breakfast / brunch which I know they pride themselves on, but will make a point of it soon."}
{"text":"I don't even remember what I ordered when I went to Latitude 41n -- I know I shared the artichoke bake (just okay) with my mom, and either I didn't get an entree or got a particularly unremarkable one -- but what I do remember was tasting my mother's order of the Latitude Attitude with Rotisserie Roasted Chicken Salad and regretting not getting it.  When I read the description of the pizza dough filled with sandwich ingredients, I was repulsed.  But seeing it in action, hot out of the oven, crispy, and full of chicken salad, I realized it was just a calzone without tomato sauce.  And it was really, really good.  I'd pick one up sometime if I'm having a heavy carbohydrate craving.  The menu is overpriced, though.  Just a note: we went on a particularly hot day, and the circulation in there was a nightmare.  Their ceiling fans barely relieved any of the heat, and the air conditioning only seemed to exist in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Waste of money, food was terrible and that nasty guy that takes your order has anger issues. Will not be back to this place."}
{"text":"Kinda pricy for how little chicken was on this salad with its super soggy croutons. Kinda wonder if it was made when I ordered it or sitting in bowl pre mixed with dressing... I like the atmosphere though, so maybe I'll try again."}
{"text":"Went to Lattitude 41 with friends in Cleveland and had a very good breakfast.  It has a very homey vibe- you order at the counter, pick up your own coffee, and find a table.  It was nice that they have a variety of good vegetarian options since half of our group doesn't eat any meat.  I had an omelette with spinach and mushrooms and it was very good.  It was well priced and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"went for brunch and was totally dumbfounded on how this place functions.  there are waiters but you have to place an order at the counter and get your own coffee THEN when your ill prepared food is ready they yell out your name looking for your table. if i wasn't there with someone that had been there before and knew the protocol i would have starved... which may have been the better option."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch- not good. At all. Waited about 15 minutes in line to order food. Woman working at the counter was rude. Food was below average. French toast was supposed to come with \"seasonal fruit\"... It was canned pineapples. With so many good brunch options in Cleveland, I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"The picture of the French Toast on the menu looks delicious. I dont know if some one messed up our order or they have a new cook, but the french toast was 3 large, dry, unsoaked cinnamon roles, that had a small smearing of egg and some hints of vanilla cream. I couldnt eat it. My friend's order the pancakes were not awful. The french toast was so awful, that I will not return and will tell all my friends to avoid this place."}
{"text":"This was a pretty terrible lunch. I ordered the veggie burger. It was homemade as promised, but it had nothing binding it together and it didn't fit on the store bought wheat bread that it was served on (it was supposed to come on 12 grain bread). It didn't seem cooked all the way through and became a huge mess when I was trying to eat it with colleagues at a lunch meeting. It was served with grilled onions, 1 slice of tomato and shredded iceberg lettuce (which just felt right off as well). It was supposed to come with homemade chips and pickles. There were no pickles and I had exactly 5 chips on my plate. They were so greasy that they were soggy, not crisp.   I would have asked them to fix it (or at least give me pickles) but no one came around to ask how the food was. There are no waiters.   Happy Dog is right across the street and much better for the same amount of money."}
{"text":"There is parking in back!!!  Overall vibe is great, good atmosphere.  Order at the counter and they deliver to table.  Coffee is self serve, food is excellent.   Breakfast Special  I ordered the breakfast special which was a ton of food for pretty cheap and had a good variety.  Overall everyone's order looked great.  Staff is friendly, and parking was easy due to the small lot in the back.  Would go back and recommend.  Eggs and French Toast  I ordered the eggs and french toast with a side of turkey sausage (they were out of the turkey sausage so I ended up getting a side of fruit, which was fine). The french toast was a bit dry but good and the eggs weren't very \"over easy\". This is my second time at Latitude 41, and what I ordered the first time was much better (the mushroom breakfast pizza). Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere and coffee bar at Latitude 41 - so I would return! Love this place for breakfast club meetings.   The Breakfast Special I had the breakfast special, so I had eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, toast, fruit, a piece of cinnamon roll french toast, and coffee. The breakfast staples we're just as good as any other breakfast place but the cinnamon roll french toast was something different and it was delicious. I had it with their cinnamon coffee and it was the perfect combination. The whole meal was really cheap and tasted wonderful. Definite pluses are the coffee bar (with good coffee) and a place to park. I'd definitely eat there again.   Pizza for Benedict - Portebello mushroom I knew coming in that this wouldn't disappoint me, we have already been here once for breakfast and because it was so good we decided to come back.  This was a \"pizza\" but very different than your traditional pizza, it was perfect for breakfast.  The dough was not too thick and had an excellent taste.  The poached eggs were made appropriatly and the hollandaise sauce was also very good.  It was not some boxed concoction.  It was a little spicy but not too much so.  Overall this was an excellent dish, I would definitely get it again.  The cinnamon coffee is one of the best I've had in Cleveland.  I love how it is self-serve, there is not waiting when you want a refill and the cinnamon flavor is different but delicious.  Right Coast Omelette There was no shortage of chicken and spinach in it! Very good food for a decent price!  Lat 41°n Kick*ss French Toast The Kickass French Toast was delicious. They are like giant cinnamon rolls. You have your choice of ordering 1 to 3 pieces. It would be a great side to one of the other breakfast choices.  Cure For a Hangover Pizza This was definitely a cure for a hang over. I've never had a pizza with an egg in the middle of it, but it was really good. The pizza itself was great. The crust, sauce, and cheese ratio was perfect. Coffee bar was awesome and they brew some of the best cinnamon coffee in Cleveland! The atomosphere is very chill. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, once for brunch and once for dinner. Both times I was very  pleased. The food is great and the prices are really good. It's a good place to take friends or family for a casual but delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Cleveland! Seat yourself. Order at the counter. Self serve coffee bar. Get the Benedict pizza! Pizza dough with spinach, mozzarella, ham, two poached eggs, and homemade hollandaise! ORGASMIC! No seriously, ORDER IT! Been here multiple times and food never disappoints. Hangover breakfast pizza is huge! Defiantly can split it! Yummmmmy!!! Wish I lived closer :("}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. Great menu with some unique items like the \"attitudes\" stuffed baked sandwiches. I love this setup- it's charming and low maintenance.  You seat yourself, order from the counter and they run their food to you. Also has parking, which is a big win.   My food was good-we had three giant baked meatballs with sauce, cheese and bread to dip. The Italian salad and Cobb salad were both awesome because they were large portions and had my favorite: shredded lettuce!   Overall we had a good experience and will definitely be back, probably for breakfast because I hear they have a pretty solid one."}
{"text":"You seat yourself, place your own order, get your own coffees, wait for your name to be called out to signal the server to your table, and then there's a line for tipping on the bill? Nothing we received was done as we had ordered it, and only 3 other tables in the place. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I LOVE their veggie omelet with their home grown herbs,not to mention their awesome pizzas and specials. The ahi tuna was fantastic-and I have had that in Hawaii.This was just as good here!"}
{"text":"on a whim we pulled into the parking lot after having driven around for a bit looking for breakfast before the zoo. Glad we pulled into here. For like six bucks you get so much food. The eggs were fresh, grits delish, bacon very thin but good.   We will be back again. Cute grungy little place."}
{"text":"We really really wanted to like this place...  This is the second time we have visited here.  I did not write a review the first time because I was really hoping it was an off day for them.  So months later we gave it a second shot.    My hubby got the tomato bisque tasted like there was cleaning fluid in it ( his description ) and the consistency was grainy, almost sandy..!!  And it was only lukewarm, Yuck.  His sandwich that was supposed to be hot, but it  was cold. As for me, I got the chicken parmesan.  It was nice and hot and the dish was tasty.  But I could see how horrible my husbands dish looked and tasted so that really took away some of my joy.  I liked my dish - but not enough to return. After 4 meals, with 3 of them being bad, I gotta say that the odds are not good enough for us to use our money and time on returning. The restaurant is super cute, and the location is great.  I hate that the food is not worth the effort to eat there. But we will browse the Yelp reviews and if one day it looks like they got a better cook and kitchen staff we may try it again.  Until then..."}
{"text":"Wonderful as always. You can't miss with the menage a trois breakfast and at lunch my ex girlfriend's favorite pizza rocks, and the twisted cobb salad is tasty too. The service is always friendly, even when they are slammed on weekend mornings. I love to bring out of towners here because they love the atmosphere and the huge servings of food."}
{"text":"Too bad you can only give this five stars. It deserves more than that. We drove from Detroit just for breakfast....yes it's that good.  Chesapeake omelette is the best I have ever had in my life. Cinnamon coffee was amazing."}
{"text":"When I heard about this small little place in the Detroit Ave neighborhood, I wanted to try it.   I have been here a total of two times and I have yet to have a bad dish.  After asking my friends, I have found that not a single one of them had a bad thing to say.    When I was here I noshed on their 'Kick Asterisk' french toast, which is cinnamon rolls, battered and pan fried like french toast.  This dish has all the sweetness of a brunch item, you can hold the syrup.    Another one of my favorites was the Chicken and Waffles.  This is a great southern dish that can fit right in on the shores of Lake Erie, 1,000's of miles from it's home in Atlanta, GA.    If you want an eclectic take on Brunch or breakfast classics, this needs to be on your bucket list"}
{"text":"I've heard really good things about this place, so this morning I decided to stop in. I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant. It feels so cozy, but it's large enough to find a table with ease on a Saturday morning. The staff are really nice and helpful.  I had the cure for a hangover pizza. Yummy! While I was waiting for my food to arrive, I scoped out other parties' food around me. Everything I saw looked good. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday for the first time with my husband.  The set-up is somewhat confusing - you go to the counter to get your own menu, find your own seat, then get in line to order/pay at the counter, then the food is brought to your table.  Luckily another patron explained it to us, or we would have waited in the long line thinking we were waiting for a table and gotten to the front without having looked at the menu.  They should probably put up a sign explaining what to do when you walk in the door.  They do have self-serve coffee and water, which is a really nice touch, I think.  We didn't have to wait very long for our food, but we did see lots of other orders coming out of the kitchen, and they all looked amazing.  Huge portions, and definitely hearty looking brunch fair.  I tried the hangover pizza (potatoes, cheese, sausage, tomato, and eggs), which was really good.  The pizza dough and sauce were both excellent, and I would not hesitate to try one of their other pizzas.  My husband had the Plowman's breakfast (ham, eggs, toast, potatoes, and pancakes), which is a ton of food for the cost.  They did mess it up a little bit - his toast was burned, and they initially brought him sunny-side-up eggs instead of the scrambled he requested.  They fixed it quickly though.    I didn't go up to the counter, but all the servers who were bringing food and taking plates were very nice and were definitely hustling.  One thing that we liked on the menu was that you can substitute egg whites for eggs at no charge, and you can also get 2 pancakes (which were awesome) instead of the toast and potatoes that comes with some breakfast orders (definitely get the pancakes instead!).  Also, since we had just been at the Capitol Theater for the Sunday morning classic movie, we got 20% off our brunch, which made it an even better value (still would have been worth the money without the discount, I think).  Sunday morning movie and brunch was a great, affordable date (about $30 total)!"}
{"text":"I never know whether or not to give stars holistically or comparatively.  I went with holistic scoring this time.   Why I came here:  I'm in town and asked someone, a few blocks away, where to eat. She struggled for a moment and then exclaimed, \"Oh...\"  So, I came here.   The food I tried:  mozzarella wedges and Sicilian \"Attitude\" (like a calzone) -Wedges: were awesome and the sauce was alright too -(calzone) \"Attitude:\" interesting and tasty  I'd order either again happily.   Ambiance:  Great!! Service:   Friendly!! Prices:   Reasonable!! Location:   Kind of a trek from Brooklyn, so I may not be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a hand full of times since moving to the Detroit Shoreway area last year. Initially, I had a great experience. Even though the menu options are heavy and essentially all comfort food, I managed to eat healthy enough, choosing an omelet and gazpacho. The soup by the way always gets five stars...it's the one thing Lattitude does really well. They did mess up our order so we were given a large pizza to go for free! Of course I'm not complaining about that! I also really liked this sweet guy who was working there for a time...but for some reason or another he's gone.   After going a couple times, I have to say I feel sick and just sluggish when I leave there. The food is inconsistent at best. My omelets tend to be runny, not cooked fully and lukewarm. I tried a salad once, hoping that I wouldn't feel sick afterwards, to no avail. Every friend I've taken there has felt the same....except for my brother. He didn't praise the food, but he didn't knock it either. I consider him a pretty reliable food critic, so that says something I suppose."}
{"text":"I'm always in the mood to try a new breakfast place. I found them on a \"best breakfast spots in Cleveland\" list. The parking was not great but it was a beautiful fall morning so a quick 5 minute walk was fine. We get inside and the setup was confusing at first so we asked the counterperson and we were fine. It gave us a campus feel like we were back in college. The menu was simple. The food was mediocre. I had the menage a trois with eggs over hard  (which came out with very soft yolks) and the sausage and bacon. The sausage was ok, the bacon was not crisp at all and mostly fat. The wheat toast was toasted well. The breakfast potatoes were seasoned well but it felt like an extremely small portion. The side of grits made me gag a little.  Overall it wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't the worst place I've been. It's not worth a return visit for me."}
{"text":"Latitude is a delightful place to eat. I have been many times before. My husband and I love to go for breakfast, they have the best coffee in town and many delicious breakfast options. In addition to having excellent food, they also offer a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere and exceptional customer service.  Today I went in with my husband for lunch. Not only were my tomato bisque and my blt delicious but Chrissy the chef even came out and talked with us. She was very sweet and kind. She made us feel right at home. Our waiter Brian was also super accommodating. Latitude is the perfect place to have an above average experience for a below average price. We will definitely continue to give them our patronage and you should too!  Betty and Ralph"}
{"text":"First time here and I would agree with previous reviews on saying it's mediocre. First off, the set up of the order pay then sit was a little confusing. There were only two women working - one at the register and one bringing food out. The older woman was definitely confused on bringing out orders and seem a bit out of it. She couldn't answer simple questions on the menu. Also there was food sitting on tables from previous patrons the entire time we were sitting down.. they really need additional staffing  The food was alright but nothing I would rave about. I got the Left Coast omelette and the amount of cheese they put on it was overwhelming. Barely any avocado or bacon. Just mostly melted cheese. The house potatoes were poorly seasoned and only tasted like grease. The coffee they had was a bit burnt and lacking in creamer options.   The seasonal mimosa was definitely delightful but a bit pricey for $7.  Overall I wouldn't recommend this as a go to breakfast place."}
{"text":"One of my go-to spots for brunch.  The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, the food is ALWAYS delicious, and I'm a big fan of the cinnamon coffee.  I went this past Sunday and the fresh fruit that came with my croissant was wonderful.    If you go on a Saturday, they have an AWESOME breakfast deal, but you have to be there early (maybe before 10?).  If you can drag yourself out of bed that early, you'll save a bundle (think half the price)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Really cool atmosphere, but the food left me regretting I walked in. I got the Eggy Cake. Said 2 eggs but I know I only got one. Pancakes were cold; my butter didn't melt. The bacon while crispy, tasted cheap and \"bulk\" like. The hash browns, or what they serve as hash browns were half cooked chunks of potatoes tasting only of starch.   The coffee was sad. My partner got an omelet with avocado, that was brown more than green. It was not really good. In addition he said, too, the bacon tasted cheap. Doubt I will ever go back, kinda sad cause the staff is great and the place is cool. No one even asked if we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Amazing we always go for breakfast and decided to go for dinner. Food was really good, Krissy was amazing and helped us figure out what to order. We will defiantly be back when Krissys working"}
{"text":"This place has a European touch where you order and pay at the counter, then have the food brought out to you. The staff is friendly, the place is a nice mix of restaurant and café with a little lounge area. The breakfast special served on weekdays (menage-a-trois) is great value for money. All in all, a place I'd gladly come back to."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place reminds me of any restaurant featured on Kitchen Nightmares.  Large & poorly executed menu, trying to be too many things at once, lacks attention to details.    Is this place a brunch spot, cafe, full-scale restaurant or after-hours lounge?  Half-filled with sofas and alcoholic drinks, half restaurant, I'm confused.    With such an expansive menu without a real concept, it's no surprise that the food comes out just \"ok.\"  Added bonus:  half of the large menu is deep fried.   Lastly, pay attention to details!  A few suggestions include presentation of the food - don't just throw items onto the plate and send out, logical parings - ie, more than 10 tortilla chips to a dog bowl-sized appetizer, and creating a friendly atmosphere for diners - kindly provide utensils and/or help the confused customer that doesn't know whether to ask for or get their own water.   Overall, I would like to believe Latitude has a lot of potential to improve.  A few small tweaks here and there and an instilled sense of pride in what they're doing can easily transform this into the neighborhood joint it's trying to be (I think? I'm still confused.)"}
{"text":"I live very close to the Gordon Square in Cleveland , so there is a lot of great restaurants close by. A couple weeks ago, I decided to give this place a try.   Latitude 41n is a quaint little restaurant. I got my food to go so I can't tell you anything about the service. I plan on going to enjoy a sit down meal in the future, so I shall update my review when that happens.    I got the Right Coast omelet, which came with hash browns and toast. I have never had chicken in an omelet before, and I plan on having it again. I also had a pumpkin cinnamon roll thing that had cream cheese topping. (I have no idea what it was called, I just asked for it because it looked delightful). They are open all day so I can't wait to try their lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"I really love local Cleveland businesses. I wanted to love Latitude 41N, and don't get me wrong - I did enjoy the experience, but the last star is missing due to the fact that my order was not as described in the menu.   For starters, I had no idea where to park. We ended up parking across the street behind Spice Kitchen + Bar... which I'm not sure was allowed. I think there is parking on the street (W.58th) and also behind the building, but this was our first time and we were confused.  Then, I was even more confused because we didn't know where to enter. A little pointing finger on the window faced the back of the building and said \"Parking and Entrance\"  - we walked to the back and found no entrance... so confused - but apparently we just didn't walk far enough around the building because there is an entrance next to the patio seating area. In addition, you can walk through the front entrance, which is what we ended up doing.  First impression - I love this place! The restaurant is welcoming, sunlight beaming through the windows onto map adorned tables, and smiling faces of the staff greeted us. Thanks to Yelp, I knew to make my way to the back counter to order. Our visit was on a Sunday morning, so plenty of Sunday Brunch menus were laid out on the counter for us to peruse.  I was in the mood for some southwestern inspired breakfast after having a fabulous experience at the Borderline Café in Lakewood. So the first item on Latitude's Sunday Brunch menu stuck right out to me: Southwest Quesadilla | grilled flour tortillas stuffed with scrambled eggs, chorizo sausage, avocado, black beans, juicy tomatoes & melted cheddar cheese topped with fresh salsa & sour cream. Yummie sounding, right?! I thought so too. Fast forward 15 minutes - my dish arrived, looking delicious, but after the first bite, I realized this quesadilla was lacking chorizo (it just had regular sausage), and the avocado and tomatoes were nonexistent, honestly - not even a trace... and there may have well only been 10 black beans in the whole thing. But! To Latitude's defense - this quesadilla was still as cheesy and delicious as ever and it was HUGE. Definitely more than enough to share. The boyfriend had ordered the Suns Up! | a bowl of housemade granola topped with berries, banana slices & lowfat fruit yogurt. His selection came exactly as described and was delish.  To back up a bit... you order and pay in the back - grab a beverage (serve yourself coffee and water or you can select soda, which they will give you glasses of at the counter), then you find an open seat - either in their sunlit, warm, and inviting dining room, or out on the gorgeous patio to enjoy the weather.  Once your delicious selections are prepared, the friendly staff at Latitude will come find you. If you need refills, you can either step up to the counter and ask for another soda (during our visit, one of the staff brought us refills, which I thought was fab) or you can refill your own coffee and water. For some, \"serve yourself\" might be off putting, but for me this set up made me feel like I was visiting an old friend's place, and I really liked that.  Also note that the ever popular Ménage à Trois (2 eggs, bacon, sausage, home fries, toast & a cup of coffee for $4.95 aaaand for a buck extra, you can select 2 additional sides) is only Monday through Saturday and only runs till 11am. Don't oversleep.  Latitude also carries Bloody Mary's and Mimosas... which I shall partake in upon my next visit.   Pleasantly pleased Latitude, thank you!"}
{"text":"Great deal for some delicious, well made food. The service was very friendly and the food came out incredibly quick. Definitely coming back next time we're in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Ordered Vegetarian quesadilla, and two salads.  The salads were good, perhaps overpriced; homemade dressings were delicious and matched the salads well.  But,  the quesadilla sucked big-time.  In order to eat it, I had to convince myself that the dark brown \"avocado\" was actually overcooked mushroom.  My girlfriend generally doesn't eat tomatoes so she picked them off along with the avocados.  When the manager came by and saw the pile, she said nothing of the avocado but commented that she went ahead and put the tomatoes on the quesadilla because she had some of them a few days prior (this is during the salmonella scare) and she had not experienced any sickness yet.  Uhh, goo.  I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"As soon as we got here, we weren't welcomed in and did not know how to be seated. Once being seated, the coffee machine was never filled, even throughout the duration of our visit. Also, to top it off, my coffee cup still had a lip stick stains on it! The food was mediocre and I would most likely not visit again. If you were to go, the friends that I was with enjoyed the southwest quesadilla."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best customer service I have ever had! The BLT crab cake sandwich was delicious and their Tuscan pasta is also worth a try. The staff there is definitely what made my experience so great. I really enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and plan on going back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and have never walked away feeling sorry. The first time was for Sunday brunch and ordered the pancakes that had a snickers candy bar mixed in with the batter. oh so yummy if you are not watching the carlories. Definitely worth trying at least once or sharing with a friend as they are very sweet!!   The second time I was with a very large group of close to 20 people. Once again they did a very good job keeping up with our entire group. One thing that they have going is that you order your meal at the counter and then they bring it out to you. For a group as large as the one that I was in, this may have been the best thing for us. I had a pizza and it was one that I would get again as well. Others had their Mac & cheese which they said was good as well.   If you are ever in the area and want to try something new...definitely stop in and see what people are talking about."}
{"text":"\"quirky\" would be a nice way of describing this confusing and questionable place.  I was so hoping that Latitude we be an excellent addition to my brunch repertoire but I think it's fairly likely that I won't be back again.  As others have said... it's confusing.  As a customer you walk into a restaurant where people are seated, and are having meals delivered to them.  But you are actually supposed to walk up to the back counter and skim through menus that are handed to you before placing your order, paying, and then look for a place to sit.  The menu was expansive, and had some inventive items.  I decided to try the Chesapeake omelet ($10), which was stuffed with lump crab and artichoke creme cheese.  Unfortunately it was so salty that it was virtually inedible.  The only bright spot among the three different meals we tried was the WONDERFUL tomato bisque.  The creamy delight had crumbled blue & homemade croutons."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place, myself.  I've been there a half dozen times or so, including one time where I took a group of 20 ladies with me.  I heard no complaints on the meals that time and I've always been pleased with mine.  Yes, it may be a bit overpriced but it's in one of those areas that's trying to become trendy.  The only thing I don't understand is why on Earth you have to order at the counter..."}
{"text":"Okay, this was...a surprise.   We stopped off here during a Dyngus Day outing in an attempt to find an out of the way spot due to the massive crowds in Gordon Square.  From the outside, we thought that the place was going to be pricey, as it looked rather upscale. Imagine my surprise when we found a place that seemed to combine a restaurant with a coffee house that ALSO served libations (beer and wine,) and had a variety on the menu.   We had some great sandwiches, and were very pleased with the service and the overall feel of the place. Patty also got pierogies which were of a local, tasty variety and over all, we were very happy.   As we only had a brief stint here, I will only say that I am definitly going to give Latitude 41N another try...and I promise I'll give them plenty of latitude when I do:)  (Yep, I went there:)"}
{"text":"Summary:  Great spot in Gordon Square to check out for breakfast/brunch. However, they may be inconsistent with how the food is cooked.    I've lost count on how many times I've been here for the menage a trois breakfast special. Arguably the best breakfast deal in Gordon Square.  The quality of their food is usually top notch, with the occasional undercooked egg or burnt hash during times of high volume customers.  Great open seating atmosphere with a self-serve coffee, water, and iced tea bar. I love the cinnamon coffee option, and that it's so strong that I'm tempted to add some cream to dilute it. Keep 'em coming!   The staff are courteous, quick, and professional. Kudos (if that's still a term to use) to them."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 3. Latitude's not blow you away cool but definitely has a fun map vibe for weekend brunch and a cozy atmosphere to nurse a hangover in.  Cost: 5. There are cheaper breakfast options out there but portions are pretty generous.  Menage-a-Trois special is a steal.  Food Quality: 4. Asterisk - I've only been here for breakfast/brunch.  Great every time I go.  Highlights: Menage-a-Trois, Cure-for-a-Hangover Pizza, Lat 41 Special, Griddle Cake's, Pizza for Benedict (probably favorite). Only item I'd avoid is the French Toast, almost like frozen roll's Pillsbury makes and they're kind of soggy.  Again, large portions so you're not leaving hungry.  Service: 5. Counter service, but they clean the tables quickly as well.  Coffee and water are help yourself which is great.  When to return: Lazy weekend morning, casual bite to eat with friends, nursing a hangover and need massive quantities of water/coffee/food. Definitely worth checking out, I was surprised rating isn't higher."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this place. I drove from Akron to Cleveland (in search of a dog friendly restaurant I could eat lunch at before heading on to Indiana) specifically to eat here. I looked up the reviews online before heading out and checked out the menu and everything seemed good. I called ahead to double check their pet policy and dogs are welcome on the patio. Maybe it was just me (being an out of towner) but I didn't feel this restaurant was in a particularly nice neighborhood, but it wasn't bad enough to make me forego stopping. I ordered a half order of mac and cheese (which I love) and was pleasantly surprised that it came with a side salad as well. You order and pay before sitting down (like a cafe) and my food came pretty quickly (minus the water I had asked for for my dog, which I had to ask for a second time, but was then promptly brought out). My chopped salad was really good, but the sad part is my mac n cheese was not. It was SO bland. It honestly tasted like nothing, which was really surprising and disappointing. I added a good amount of salt to it, which helped initially, but only for a few bites. I ultimately decided it wasn't worth all the calories. I ended up scraping all the melted cheese off the top and eating it with the slice of bread it came with. Overall, I give this place 3 stars. The staff was very friendly and accomodating, the salad was excellent, but the mac n cheese was very disappointing. I will point out that I did not send it back or say anything to them about it, which was my choice, so they may have offered to fix this had I spoken up. If I lived in Cleveland I would probably go here one more time and try something else."}
{"text":"Great service and good food! The atmosphere is really nice. I like the fact that you pay for your food and seat yourself...no waiting for someone to come and take your order, it's already taken care of. The staff was nice and friendly. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Latitude is our go-to breakfast place on the weekends when we don't want to wait, and don't want to spend a ton of money. Very laid back, wide variety of options. I love the laid back atmosphere, and that it's not super packed so you can go with a group and have a conversation. They have some great breakfast deals... less than $5 for eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, coffee, and toast. But I always go for the Pizza Benedict... which is eggs benedict, but on pizza dough! Their special breakfast items are a little pricier (like... $8), but tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Well not very often do I give just 1 star but after hearing the hype, and hype it is, about this place we decided to give it a try. I ordered the pan seared Oatmeal with fresh fruit compote and my wife ordered a Chesapeake Omelet. Well let's start! My oatmeal came luke warm and the fruit was cold and hard and the wife's omelet was grey and the crab meat was oddly colored too and the hollandaise sauce it was supposed to come with was MIA or under the mound of unmelted cheese. Plus her breakfast was supposed to come with hash browns, normally a shredded potato product in these parts not a diced skin on red potato.  The order at the counter and find your seat and wait concept is fairly odd and the decor is blah and needs updated. I'm sure the hipster scene loves this place but we took our chance and they missed the mark. Will not be back for sure."}
{"text":"We specifically went to Latitude 41 on Sunday because my Southern boyfriend was craving some chicken and waffles.  This dish doesn't frequent the menu of a lot of restaurants here in Ohio, so when he finds a place that does serve it...he won't stop bugging me until we go try it out!  I knew about the whole order-at-the-counter-serve-yourself thing before we arrived, so that didn't bother me much.  What did bother me was the grumpy old man (presumably the owner?) that was behind the counter.  I cheerfully greeted him with a \"hi, how are you?\" and was ignored.  I knew he heard me...I was directly across the counter from him.  But he just continued messing with his credit card receipts and angrily barking something at one of the other staff members.  He finally decided to acknowledge us after a minute or so, and by acknowledge I mean he grabbed his pen and order pad and looked at us expectantly.  I ordered my meal and then my boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles.  The grump, who before this hadn't said two words to us, snapped  \"we're out\". We just looked at him and he gave the excuse that the waffle iron is broke.  My poor boyfriend didn't have a back-up plan (he wanted the chicken and waffles SOOOO BAD people!) so he had to scramble for the menu and look for something else to order.  This seemed to irritate the grump behind the counter so I had to pretty much say listen buddy, the chicken and waffles is the only reason we hauled our @sses down to this place so back off and give him time to browse the menu!  I think the grump got the point because when my boyfriend went up to get a refill on iced tea later on, the grump gave him a voucher to come back and get a chicken and waffles on the house.  Nice try at a recovery, but we won't be back.  Not only was the grump very off-putting on a Sunday afternoon...they served me a completely scorched omelet.  I'm not talking over-cooked...I'm talking the entire bottom was black and burnt to a crisp.  Totally disgusting!  My boyfriend urged me to send it back, but I had lost my appetite by that point.  So my suggestion to you folks is skip the rude service and over-priced bad food and eat a pop tart at home.  Be live me, its the better choice!"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst food that has ever been in my mouth. Service and Servers = LOSER CENTRAL. Hope the place turns into something cool in the next year."}
{"text":"I wish I didn't have to give them 1 star. This was the absolute worst breakfast I have ever had. The potatoes were obviously days old and tasted like garbage. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with their homemade sausage which tasted rotten. The scrambled eggs were barely cooked on the sandwich. I didn't take more than 2 bites of my sandwich. I also felt very sick after eating the small bites I did take. I won't ever be back and I would suggest not wasting your time here. There are plenty of other excellent places.   Quick note about the service, if you can call it that. Our plates were slammed down in front of us with an abrasive 'enjoy'."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast. Keep in mind, they can't serve alcohol until 11am on Sundays! Between the two of us, we had their steel cut oatmeal, hangover pizza, grits, and each had a coffee. The oatmeal was wonderful - it was baked into triangles so it held together. It also had a seasonal compote that was very nice and different. The pizza was DELICIOUS! I would definitely come here for this again. The grits were disappointing - I've had grits plenty of times so I know they can be plain, but I was hoping for a little more flavor with these (sadly, they were just watery tasting). The coffee was also just okay, not sure if it's the coffee itself or the way it's brewed? The pizza Benedict was something we did not order but will be back to try.  The decor and overall interior was just okay, but I did appreciate their gender neutral bathrooms! There was also a woman walking around to check on people which was nice. The place itself is order at the counter and sit down which creates a casual atmosphere (we liked it).   Overall, nice local place that we'll come back to for a few specific items."}
{"text":"My friend and I were both first timers and decided to go for brunch since someone gave me a gift certificate.  Arrived at 12:40. A server passing by could tell we were not familiar with the drill and took the time to explain the order at counter, find your own table and get your own water/coffee drill.   We ordered at 12:50, paid, got our drinks and sat down.  It was busy, but not packed. Excited about what we ordered based on menu options for brunch although they were 86 French toast. We ordered pancakes instead along with pizza Benedict, etc.  No interaction from servers until food delivered. We noticed everyone that ordered before and after us seemed to have gotten their food.  My friend went up to check on food and then it came a few min later....at 1:40, exactly 50 min after we ordered it.  The food had a ton of potential but ours was a mix of perfect, dry and plain burnt.  Not sure if they forgot us then rushed it or it sat a while after being prepared."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp and always said i'd try it but never actually went.. Until recently, I was driving in the area and it just appeared! I went in to order and i must say, it was a great decision.. the food was great! rated it a 4 because the customer service isn't that great.. they don't greet you, at all."}
{"text":"Love the food at this place.. Took the parentals for Sunday breakfast and it was the bomb.. They had never been there before and we so I suggested a few options.. The cinnamon coffee there is my favorite always hot and fresh. We got the pancake breakfast, French toast breakfast and one of their delicious omelettes... We left with both our hearts and stomachs full of yummy goodness"}
{"text":"I had a really good breakfast here on 10-29-16, for just under $5, including good coffee with free refills.  (Two eggs, two strips of crispy bacon, two sausages, two slices of buttered rye toast AND buttery grits.).  Come on!  This bargain can't be beaten.  Everything is served steaming hot, the staff is good on all counts, the place is inviting and clean and the noise level is moderate even when business is poppin'.  I love this place.  Whoever is managing Latitude is doing a fantastic job, especially in hiring hard working, nice and friendly staff, and in serving up some really good food."}
{"text":"I was really craving some brunch type food yesterday morning and decided to try Latitude 41N in Gordon Square.   Upon entering, I was very confused about what to do. You grab a menu, go and sit anywhere you'd like and then you can come back up to place your order at the counter. There isn't really any sort of table service save for when they bring your food out to you. It's all pretty much self-serve. Not too bad of a thing, really... unless you're annoyed with having to go up and ask for a refill on a soda. Coffee is out and accessible along with water.   Their menu offers mostly breakfast/brunchy items. I really liked what I ordered -- Pizza for Benedict. It was a twist on traditional eggs benedict that involved pizza dough -- very yummy. You can choose between four different proteins to add to your dish. I chose Maryland crab cakes and was very happy with my meal. The portion was very large and also came with a side of cheesy hash browns. I could barely put a dent in my plate.  They're pretty kid friendly as well. A small kids menu where everything was around $5. The portion was pretty large for a kids size too. My son had pancakes with fruit. Three very large pancakes served with cinnamon butter (nom) and a cup of fresh fruit on the side. He's a little chub, like his mom, so he ate two of the pancakes. He loved them so much that he didn't even throw one piece on the floor! Amazing.   I would most likely return to Latitude 41N. Very decent food, okay atmosphere, reasonable prices. I'm not sure I'd want to come for dinner. They seem to do brunch items pretty well. I'd stick with that."}
{"text":"Wow!!  For a kick-ass breakfast you have got to try the Menage a Trois, which is offered until 11am daily, I believe.  $3.95 for eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, hash browns, and coffee.  And for $1 more, you get your choice of two additional items, such as fried green tomatoes, breakfast quesadilla, pancakes, french toast, and much more.  It's quite an amazing bargain and the food is really good.  Quantity without quality isn't much of a deal, but this place definitely has both.  Not to mention, the atmosphere is quite cozy and cute.    I just have a couple suggestions for improvement which, if implemented, would make Latitude 41 a true 5-star establishment:   - Kitchen: use larger plates and put the menage a trois and the additional side items all on one big Cheesecake Factory-sized plate.  This would allow food to be delivered more in an all-at-once fashion, which I imagine is preferable to most customers.  - Servers: provide condiments without being asked -- this is pretty basic.  When you're serving toast, why not assume people are gonna want jelly?  Likewise, if you're bringing pancakes and french toast, save yourself a trip and bring along the syrup."}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch. I've come here several times, and for the first time ordered takeout. The eggs on the pizza for Benedict were a little overdone, but everything was still amazing. I was part of the \"clean plate club\", and will continue to be."}
{"text":"I love the fact they are in the Detroit Shoreway area and are a positive addition.  That being said.. Not so much a fan of the pizza. Quite greasy and bland.  Didn't like the Mac and cheese so much.  But my 3 stars are totally for the tomato bisque.  Can eat it every day and never tire!  Viva la Bisque!!"}
{"text":"I upgraded to three stars solely based on the premise that if you order your salad to go, you get much more than you get if you eat it there."}
{"text":"I am not much of a breakfast person so my experience here is mostly limited to lunch and dinner. They have the best tomato bisque soup! Pizza is also pretty tasty for a non-pizza place. And the lattitude attitudes are good as well. The spinach salad with warm dressing is also a winner in my book. The bakery items are also usually pretty good. Yes you have to place your order at the counter and yes you have a waiter - but not really. But once you get the flow of how this place works its not really an inconvenience."}
{"text":"this place is the epitome of comfort food. you know what's worse than valentines day?  going out the morning after to get breakfast thinking the holiday is over and then realizing everyone else is on their morning after breakfast date.  eff that ish man. so I ordered the pizza by benedict. benedicts have sort of been my thing recently. on pizza dough? heck yeah. I ask if I can get the vegetarian meatball added on top, and they said no, so I just order a side. they warn me I'll need a box. the pizza dough is amazing! brilliant idea. the poached eggs aren't really poached but that's ok with me, I don't really like that runny yolk anyway. veggie meatballs are good, but made of rice, nothing soy producty, which is what I was expecting. loads of cheese. it's a meal in and of itself. so by the end of that meal, I had forgotten all about everyone around me. and for sure I took a box home.  comfort food."}
{"text":"Good food at a low price. Everything I've ever gotten here has been fresh and good quality, and they offer diverse enough choices that you can take your picky eater or vegetarian friends and everyone will find something to enjoy. The employees are friendly and can answer your questions or customize an order for you. I like the casual and artistic vibe here."}
{"text":"I've lived on the West Side of Cleveland for almost 3 years now, but have never been to Latitude 41N before today. And I'm sad that I haven't been there for breakfast until now. It was delicious!  The restaurant is bright and welcoming with a lot of windows that look out on Detroit Avenue. It's a \"counter service, bring food to table\" type of restaurant, so diners must order at the desk in back of the restaurant and wait at the tables for food. My breakfast companion and I were the first ones in the door at 8:00 AM, and he tells me that they do get very busy, especially on the weekends.  We both ordered the Menage a Trois breakfast which is a steal for $4.95 and includes eggs, bacon, sausage made in house, home fries, toast, and coffee. I added a piece of french toast which was more like a cinnamon roll (but delicious) for $2 more. The coffee is unlimited and self-serve and there were two flavors available. Everything was delicious and I highly recommend this place!  I did notice that they have a lunch and dinner menu (but close at 9:00 PM) so I will have to come back. They had a good selection of beer and wine as well and there is ample parking in a lot in the back (a plus for the growing Gordon Square area). I'll definitely return and soon!"}
{"text":"My first time here was a little confusing in the beginning. The restaurant setup is order+pay at the counter & then seat yourself, but there were no obvious signs to indicate this to first-timers & the staff didn't really say anything either. We eventually figured things out for ourselves through observation, but it would have been nice to know this when we walked in. Also, the space is not air-conditioned, so it was on the warm side.  The food was good for the most part except that they can't properly poach an egg no matter how many times we asked them to redo it. The first two pairs of poached eggs with our dishes were just hard-boiled. In the one pair of replacements we were given, only one egg was poached & the other was again hard-boiled. By this time, I stopped caring & just wanted to finish my food so I could leave. The wait staff was accommodating to my dilemma & apologetic, but honestly if your kitchen staff can't poach an egg, then don't offer it on the menu. Also, my greens salad was just a bowl of spinach with too much oil. :u  It was a mediocre experience altogether. I might go back, but it definitely wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Dinner? Yay! Breakfast? Meh.  I've been to Lat41n three times; twice for dinner and once for breakfast. For dinner, I really enjoyed their alfredo pasta and mac & cheese turkey burger (I think I gained 5lbs just typing that).   Recently, I visited for breakfast and had a less-than-stellar experience. My boyfriend and I both ordered the french toast. To our surprise, we received cinnamon roll torpedoes that looked (and tasted) store bought. While I assume that's not the case, we were still disappointed. Additionally, I ordered the homemade turkey sausage which was bland and had an odd texture.   While our breakfast missed the mark, I'm sure we will be back for dinner. Service here is decent but the place itself could use a renovation."}
{"text":"The owner has created a place to feel relaxed, welcome and comfortable. Eating here is like eating at an old friend's. None of the food is particularly remarkable but overall everything is okay. And since the owner is pleasantly quirky she names her dishes humorously and adds her own twists. I have found the twists do not improve the dish. As an example, her use of heavily seasoned Italian bread crumbs overwhelm the sourness of the green tomatoes. I prefer the bacon fat and corn meal/flour coating I am used to from my years in Virginia.   The shrimp po' boy suffered from the thick tempura batter and the Cobb Salad was just average. And while I have been there with a table of twenty others who all loved the pizzas I find them something other than pizza.   As has been reported the breakfast Menage a Trois is impressive and with the two sides for a buck the best breakfast in Cleveland.   Latitude is your friend's place. You may not always love everything but you rather be here than elsewhere. At times I watch my carbs and I go out for breakfast. Every place I go I refuse the potatoes and toast. I ask if I can find a replacement or pay a reduced rate. Only Latitude thus far has let me substitute for the potatoes and toast.   Recently four of us met for breakfast coming from all over town. The fire inspector was there not allowing the kitchen to be used. The manager apologized and offered us coffee. The inspector left and soon our table was overflowing.   Upon entering the restaurant someone at the counter greets you and asks if you have ever been there. For those who have not he explains their system. Odd that some reviewers were confused. They must have walked by the guy at the counter.   Those who work there are friendly, patient and sure seem to enjoy serving us."}
{"text":"Thought I was awesome!!! Great food , it really is kick @ss French toast! Priced right. Loved the coffee. Cool room. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Latitude used to be one of my favorite casual dining spots in Cleveland.  I loved their veggie quesadilla and my husband enjoyed the fowl fingers.  My favorite dessert was the 7 layer bar (sugar coma!).  It was our comfort food go-to.  However, they changed the quesadilla recipe.  I tried a few other things on the menu and they were just so so.    I returned recently after reading recent yelp reviews, hoping that I would fall back in love. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Their veggie quesadilla was a huge disappointment. I asked for no mushrooms and then got a quesadilla filled with cheese.  Ummm, where are the other veggies?  My brother enjoyed his hangover pizza and didn't have any complaints. They do have veggie friendly options, but nothing that stood out to me.  I appreciated that it's a kid friendly place and I've always loved the maps on the table.  And kudos for having restrooms that welcome all people.  I want to love you Latitude, but right now, you're just ok."}
{"text":"Went to 41 degrees on a Saturday evening with my wife and son.  The decor reminds you of someone's living room, and stepping up to the counter to order was unexpected, but the unpretentious casual atmosphere was a nice break to going out on a Saturday and fighting the crowds.  My son loved his specialty pizza and we loved our pizza pockets, or whatever they call them and the soup was fresh and tasty.  Our waiter forgot my son's smoothie, but was right on top of getting it made right away.  Nothing gourmet, but a nice comfortable place to hang out,  Good selection of beers."}
{"text":"Wow, is this place bad.  Real bad. As my sister pointed out, it should be called Attitude, not Latitude as the employees are all kinds of mean and angry.  I wouldn't be writing this review if this wasn't the second time I have been there.....and both times were bad, bad, bad.  The servers are just mean and act annoyed that you came into the restaurant.  They slam things and snatch water pitchers right out of your hand as you are pouring a glass. The shorter man working behind the counter was nice and the saving grace of this crappy place.  I always tip at least 20% and this is the first time I haven't left a tip in a restaurant.    Onto the food.....wow.  There is a picture of pancakes on their menu and they even screw that up.  My nephew's pancake was raw inside.....who can't cook a pancake?  My brother's food was cold - the sausage tasted like it had been cooked the night before and just setting out since then.  My potatoes were ice cold - like they hadn't even been heated up ever.  My poached egg was hard in the middle - no runny yolk at all.  There was a dark hair on my food.  Frankly, I was too afraid to say anything to the rude servers as their anger was so obvious - I can't imagine what they would have done to my food if anyone complained.    I will never be returning here and would be surprised if they stay in business for much longer.  There are way better places to eat in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best bang for your nick with breakfast! Has all the basics, tastes great, and cool place!   Where else can you get a decent breakfast for $4.95$!$!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have taken a picture of my burger. It is VERY few and far between that your food actually looks like the picture. The burger was outstanding! Once I took one bite I couldn't put it down. The fries were real good as well, I was glad to see they were a mix of sweet and regular potato. My other half had the Chicken Parmesan, again an outstanding dish. We will going back there soon.   For people looking for a deal. They do different dinner deals for 6.99 during the week (Eat In or Take Out) Monday- Mac and Cheese, Salad, and Focaccia Bread.  Tuesday- Spaghetti and Meatballs, Salad, and Focaccia Bread. Wednesday- Beef or Turkey Burger, Fries, Slaw, or Chips Thursday- Chicken Sandwiches, Fries, Slaw, or Chips Friday- Fish Fry (1 Piece) Fries and Slaw OR Mac and Cheese"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and overall friendly staff. The food was well prepared and delicious. I got the southwest quesadilla with Tofu and a side of hash browns. The hash browns were border on the edge of being burnt. Overall an enjoyable experience and definitely worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Two words: Pizza Benedict. This is a thing. A glorious, glorious thing. A mini pizza (which would be delicious on its own), topped by a poached egg, and then covered in rich, creamy hollindaise. So brilliant. Not sure why in my 27 years of life I've never seen this anywhere else. Bravo, Latitude :)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast weekend special but majorly off on their Bloody Mary. I fixed it up with ketchup and Sriracha  sauce."}
{"text":"I went to Latitude for dinner this past Wednesday Evening.  I was expecting it to be somewhat busier than it was, there were only about 5 groups of people dining so I wasn't sure how to read that.    I was a bit confused about ordering, since you order at the front then go sit down.  I looked over the menu and decided on a Pizza, while debating between Small or Medium (I like Leftover Pizza) I decided on the small.. Thank God!  When the small came out it was HUGE.  The Pizza was pretty good, VERY cheesy.    I was there on a Wednesday (Burger and Brew Night) I got a 2 dollar Beer, which is always a good thing in my mind.  My friend got a burger, so I tried some of the fries.. Sadly not a fan.  I don't like to mix sweet and regular, love them both on their own.    All in All I liked the dish, wasn't crazy about the parking lot, would go back for Breakfast as it seems that might be their specialty."}
{"text":"After dropping off a friend in the area we decided to stop here for breakfast again. We had just good results the first time we were here about a year ago.  This time things a little different. For starters my wife's hash browns were served cold. They did react quickly and replaced them. The omelette  I had was good. I ordered a spinach, feta cheese and portabella mushroom. However the side of turkey sausage patties were tasteless. My wife's egg sausage and cheese wrap. It was ok.  It is structured here to go up to a counter to order your meal, which is ok, and all the beverages are self serve. A waitress brings your order but doesn't do much else. She did take the plates away. But no refills are done. So her service is limited. Kinda strange, she asks what she can help with and its s question not really expecting a response.  So this being our 2nd visit maybe the 3rd will be better."}
{"text":"Great breakfast for so cheap! I have gone to many breakfast spots and nothing compares to this one for the price & quality. 2 sides for $1 with a $4.95 full breakfast? I'm there.  Casual and fun atmosphere. The staff are really friendly and helpful as well! I would definitely recommend this spot to a friend."}
{"text":"I wish I could make it to this place more often it's so good.  They take classic dishes and make them a little more special.  The artichoke bake is like a cheesier, creamier version of the original and is served piping hot with pita chips.  We ran out of chips and ate the stuff with a spoon. My boyfriend had the reuben.  It was served almost like a calzone.  The thick rye \"pocket\" was stuffed with corned beef, sauerkraut and cheese.  So good.  I wanted it.  I had the shrimp po boy and it was delicious.  The shrimp was crispy but not overdone and you could tell it was fresh.  Overall, the food was delicious but service was a little slow and we were one of two couples in there.   We've also tried the pizzas and they're delicious as well.  Crispy and fresh tasting. If I'm in the neighborhood I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've tried several times to enjoy this place, but have not had any luck. The food is slightly above average. I will probably go back again, however, I would not confidently recommend this place to another person."}
{"text":"I feel the need to update this review bc upon my most recent visit, I was pleasantly surprised by how awesome it was. I got a coupon for a free small pizza in my email. That was pretty sweet. So I used it and was received with good service and tasty as hell pizza. I remember why, before a few bad experiences, this was my fave brunch spot. I'll be back. I guess it's safe to say the service has been hit or miss but my last visit was a home run so much so that I felt the need to change my previous review :)"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast after reading a review in Cleveland magazine and really enjoyed it.  We shared two \"Cure for a Hangover\" pizzas between 3 people, and had more than enough.  This is a totally genius pizza...sausage, tomatoes, hash browns, and sunny-side up eggs on an excellent deep dish pizza crust.  Coffee was fine - it's serve-your-own from carafes, so nothing gourmet, but it was hot and caffeinated.  :)  Cute decor inside - I liked the Ohio maps as table toppers."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. The menage a trois breakfast deal is enough food for the whole day and it's only $4.95 and coffee is included. Try the cinnamon coffee while you are here. I've been coming here for hears and the staff is always friendly the atmosphere is eclectic and the good is great. The lunch time pizzas are always worth the trip if you are in the are ready for lunch time. My family and I love this place on an early Saturday morning and we drive in from the suburbs just to eat here."}
{"text":"What a perfectly cozy restaurant for a rainy day! It warned my heart and my belly right up. When I walked in, it felt like I was walking into someone's living room/kitchen. The walls are decorated with an eclectic array of art and string lights outlined the windows. Perfect for a small group birthday celebration!  The menu looked delicious, especially all of the pizza creations, but I settled for the Caesar salad (New Year's resolutions are encouraging me to eat healthier). Holy moly, what a salad! It was dressed perfectly and it could have fed two people. Instead, it was so good, I ate the entire thing. It was served with a warm piece of focaccia bread, which I think is made there. I ate every bite of my meal and was left wanting a couch and nap.  They do have a beer and wine list and even a smoothie list, but again, cannot comment because those darn resolutions are getting in the way. As we were preparing to pay (you don't get a waiter, you go up to the register), I stood in line and smelled some sort of delicious cake-like smell. Damn those resolutions.  Last but not least, I have to mention they have a solid breakfast. There is the \"Every day but Sunday\" special (that part is self explanatory) that comes with a whole lotta stuff including eggs, meat, potatoes, fruit?, and a drink. All for 3.99. You really can't beat  it.  I will be coming back to this place again very soon...probably in February, once those resolutions were a thing of the past :)"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, decor, and idea of the restaurant.  I came here for brunch and had the Right Coast omelet (chicken, spinach, tomato and cheese goodness).  Meal was reasonably priced for the portion size.  I actually liked having the freedom of getting my own water, and ordering at the counter to have food brought out.  The decor was open and friendly while being chic and modern at the same time.  Food had a bit more grease/butter than I would like, though flavor was spot on!  I liked how they had the jam in the little sauce cups so you could dip your toast in it vs spreading it.  Or, am I the only one who likes to dip toast in jam?"}
{"text":"After writing my original review, an employee AND the owner started to send me harassing messages.  Very very unprofessional.   I posted their messages here on Yelp, but someone complained (I can't imagine who *insert sarcasm*), and so because their names were in the messages, apparently Yelp Agreed they should be removed.  I have them saved, so all friends and family will be welcome to see them on my phone on Yelp messages at anytime.  I will NEVER step foot in there again and I will make sure no friends or family ever do either"}
{"text":"love. love. love. the coffee.....insert heart emoticons, smileys, etc. it is cinnamon'y, hot and just super delish. always hits the spot! we have been numerous times and honestly this place rocks. i have never had a bad meal. we sat on the patio with our dogs on one occasion and they were welcomed as well.  i have never had a bad meal and Latitude gets my vote for a delicious lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"Yeah.. the yelling out peoples' names in the dining area is not an atmosphere plus.  I don't see why they can't get table markers and quietly deliver the food to the table.  It is a little jarring to sit here and have to hear \"EDWARD!\"  or \"FLORENCE!\"...  the food is okay.  The coffee bar is nice.  The price is quite fair to be fair.  There is wifi and it's comfortable to hang out here."}
{"text":"After hearing good things from a friend I decided to try Latitude 41n. As others have noted, the atmosphere is cool. You order at the counter and they bring you your food.   We started with the mozza wedges and tomato bisque. The wedges were delicious, with a good amount of seasoning that complimented the marinara sauce. The bisque was a bit thick, and was textured more like a thick sauce than a soup. The flavor was good, as were the croutons, but the texture was just a bit off.  We had a crab cake BLT and the and the seafood festival pasta bake. The BLT had good flavor, but nothing outstanding. The pasta bake was, I'm sorry, bad. It had a tremendous lack of seasoning, and did not taste at all of shrimp or crab. Instead, it was more of a lump of cream mixed with pasta. I found myself wondering while eating it if it could be substituted for mortar. Ugh.  Finally we ordered the 7 deadly sins dessert. While there was no description of this on the menu, it was a cookie type dessert with chocolate, coconut, and nuts. It came with ice cream and chocolate sauce. It was a nice way to end the meal, but not knock-your-socks-off amazing.  Overall I feel we went at the wrong time for the wrong type of meal. This place may be great for burgers, pizza, and breakfast, but not for full entrees. I would consider going again, but with so many other options in Ohio City, I'm not sure it'll be soon."}
{"text":"I love this place, but today we stopped in for Sunday brunch and I was a bit unpleased.  My right coast omelette had processed cube chicken in it.  What's up with that? And no more fresh jam? I hope this isn't a sign of the times."}
{"text":"Quaint little restaurant. Nothing fancy but if you're looking for good breakfast food that's reasonably priced and served by great people, this is your place. Also, the mimosas are on point; they don't short you on the champagne."}
{"text":"2 stars for potential.  How do you mess up pancakes?  Coffee was just okay. Ambiance is nice and I believe in the plan, but the food is key.  Very key.  They need to pick this up.  Get help for it.  Whatever it takes.  First impression was so bad I went back and pulled my club membership card out of the box.  This place needs help with menu and/or quality delivery from plate to plate.  Great location, friendly people, and good ideas.  Fix the food please!"}
{"text":"Really huge portions for nice prices, good atmosphere,  and some slightly creative foods. It wasn't quite the best quality,  hence the missing star, but the steak and gouda pizza pie and the crab cake blt we had were well above average fair.    Service was friendly,  but you had to go up to the counter to order at lunchtime.  Not sure if that is a regular thing or not, but I don't mind. I'll be back"}
{"text":"A really yummy brunch.  You walk up to the counter and they deliver to your table.  Really yummy omelet and large portions.  A cute little place."}
{"text":"Pros: huge portions, fairly creative food options, they have food with chorizo in it, and good coffee.   Cons: can be really hectic when you first walk in, parking lot is awful, and overall not relaxing until you have ordered and found a table.   I came for brunch on a Sunday, which I expected to be busy, but I didn't expect it to be stressful. I felt a bit pressured to place my order, the woman taking my order was a bit impatient with my indecision, and then I had to awkwardly stand around and try to be out of the way while I browsed the menu and looked for a table. They don't have much table space and you seat yourself, so the place can get crowded and you have to balance awkwardly hovering with scoping out places.   Once you've ordered and sat down, though, it's quite enjoyable. I enjoyed my food very much and appreciated how large my coffee mug was. I also liked that it was serve-yourself water and coffee. They could use some larger coffee mugs, though.  Overall: enjoyable but not a place where I plan to become a regular while there are other brunch places to check out in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre for the price. I couldn't even eat my dish because it was so drenched in sauce so I ate the chorizo breakfast meal that my friend had - that was okay. If you want smiles and great customer service go elsewhere. They lay the \"too cool for school\" vibe on pretty thick. I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"We went here at the recommendation of a friend for brunch. When we walked in the place was packed, which I expected for a Sunday at 11. The one thing that I didn't like is that we had to go up to a counter to order and the tables were first come first served. I absolutely hate that, but lucky enough for us someone got up while we were in line so I was able to swoop in and take a dirty table.   Since it was so busy the table didn't get cleared off right away but the server was super nice and was trying. I only saw him for an entire dining room!  Poor guy!  We waited quite a bit for the food but I have to say that the food was really good. I ordered the French toast and my boyfriend ordered an omelette. Both delicious.   I would definitely go back but maybe just think about going off peak because it stresses me out to have to find my own table. I honestly shouldn't have to do that at a sit down restaurant. Reminded me of fast food."}
{"text":"My mouth was salivating looking at the breakfast options there this morning. I settled on the Lat 41N special (country sausage, whipped eggs, sharp cheddar cheese & caramelized pecans on toasted focaccia served with a side of Breakfast Potatoes) while my boyfriend ordered the french toast. 45 minutes later our meal arrived (the manager did apologize though I'm still not sure why it took so long.) My entire meal was over-cooked. The potatoes ended up being the best on my plate with the help of some ketchup (and I never use ketchup)....but definitely not great. The french toast should've been soaked longer because it was flavorless and tough. Let's just put it this way....we should've gone to Lucky's."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for years for breakfast, but the turkey sausage is now like rubber, unless you're lucky enough to get there as soon as it's cooked.  otherwise, it sits and you get rubber sausage.  i love the place, but the quality of the sausage, which was a major reason for going, is now inedible."}
{"text":"I go here for breakfast every month or so. Counter ordering, serve yourself coffee. I usually get the ménage a trois. Portions are good, food is good, service is good. Nothing to rave about, just a solid neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"The set up here is very strange... be aware. You grab a menu from the counter, then order at the counter and then go and find your seating and they bring your food to your table. There is a coffee bar that you help yourself to (hint: cinnamon coffee is amaze).  Once we got passed all of that and made it to our actual meal, we were happy. I had an omelette with grits - I was super happy with my decision. That cinnamon coffee was a nice addition to my meal. I think we will come back, now that we know how to order and how this place works!"}
{"text":"Was on way home today from a client and was starving.  Stopped at Happy Dog but they were closed Monday for lunch.   I saw Latitude across street with open sign.  I have been there for breakfast but never lunch.  I ordered the sicilian sandwich and was blown way.  So many great flavors and bread was off the charts good.  I will be back often just for that"}
{"text":"This is my go-to weekend breakfast spot in Cleveland! On Saturdays if you can get here before 11, they have an amazing breakfast special that includes their delicious coffee! The options are so good, and my two favorites are the breakfast quesadilla and French toast.  They also have a really delicious steel cut oats. I don't find the set up to be confusing, it's pretty easy to figure out the first time and then you become a seasoned veteran for the next time! When you walk in they have menus at the counter and you order before you sit down. Then from there you refill your own water and coffee, but it's basically normal service. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot in the city and I have been to them all. Food is mind blowing, price is also mind blowing but I would pay double for the food here. Easy order system, quick service, self serve coffe and water bar. Hung over? This is the spot."}
{"text":"Having been an Ohio City-ite, this was my favorite breakfast stop...  Hangover pizza... Yes!  Omelettes... Absolutely! The grits and benedicts... A must!  Walk in, order at the counter, grab your coffee tea or water from the service station and have a seat. The service is pretty fast and the food is tasty."}
{"text":"Come hungry! The portions were large and the price was super affordable! We got two cranberry juice mimosas and two entrees for 28 bucks. The food was hearty and flavors were on point!"}
{"text":"Tried brunch here this morning. Did an entire circle around the unplowed, slushy parking lot in the rain before finding the only door you could get into-the first two we tried were locked. We stood in what I thought was the \"host stand\" area to be seated after someone asked us how many were in our party. Finally one of the workers behind the counter announced to the group of people standing there to sit wherever we want. As we made our way to a booth, we stopped a server who informed us to sit where we want but order and pay at the cashier stand.   At first the menu seemed a little underwhelming for options. As I was waiting in line to order, I saw a server walk by with a plate of chicken and waffles that looked amazing and were not on the menu- that's when I looked and saw a \"specials\" sign on the counter. I almost missed some pretty darn good chicken and waffles!  The chicken was fried to perfection. The waffles were not overloaded in syrup. They were awesome.   My husband got the blueberry pancakes, which he said were really good but I didn't care for them. We also got a side of the roasted redskins that probably would have went from good to amazing if there had been onions with them.   Also got a cup of their regular coffee which was one of the worst tasting coffees I ever had. I really wanted a mimosa, but at $6.50 each, that was a little too expensive for me..I'd rather go to West End of a less expensive mimosa.   While their were some things I didn't like, such as the coffee and messy parking lot, the employees were friendly and they got me on those chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy this place,.. Good food, easy atmosphere, reasonable prices, but dont know what is going on with closing at 4 during the week.  Tried to go their for dinner and cant !  Who in the world thought this one up..?   Generally when a place starts these antics its a death nail... I probably wont be back..sorry, it used to be a great place."}
{"text":"Ugh.   The woman who took our order was rude. We had never been here before and walked in just a few minutes too late to enjoy the 3.95 special or whatever, so I got something like it for significantly more, and my dining partner ordered an omelette, w/out bacon. He also asked them to hold the toast since, with his allergy to gluten, he cannot consume it.  Since he was omitting both the protein AND the side of toast, he asked if they would sub a small fruit cup or something. Without even considering it, the woman says no.  Are they losing any money by being friendly and giving him a few pieces of fruit in lieu of bacon and toast?  I doubt it.    The home fries were great, but the overall experience sucked."}
{"text":"C'mon Latitude! Seriously, will you get it together please? Hadn't been here in about 6 months but stopped by for a quick lunch before work today. Man, all of the little things (and some of the big ones) are just totally off with this place.   Today, I ordered the Mac and cheese pasta bake which I had been meaning to try ever since my first visit. I have high standards for mac and cheese (see Hoggy's review), and this just did not measure up. Really bland. Not really creamy. The large portion (plenty to take for leftovers) was $10.50. A fair price for an excellent meal - for this meal, not so much. Also came with a side 'salad' which was no good. Shredded iceberg with some tomato and cheese is not a salad in my book.    Also, every time I come here (I don't know why I keep coming back) there are just little things that make me go 'hmmm....that could be fixed so easily and it would be a lot nicer'. For instance today I was by myself and didn't want to take up a whole booth. So I took a seat at the window counter. The counter itself had been polyurethaned on top of maps (their decor) but the heat from the sun/age had made it as sticky a surface as if you had just poured a tub of maple syrup all over it. I had to move because it was so gross. Service is also lacking. I had an empty Pepsi for over 15 minutes with no server in sight.   Still can't do the one star because the Menage a Trois breakfast is pretty decent and ridiculously cheap. Latitude, you started off well, but now you're one of the worst restaurants in the Gordon Square area. Harsh, maybe. But I've given you many chances. Come on! Help yourself out!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend on a Monday night. We almost had the place to ourselves. As others pointed out, the ordering situation was strange, but I wasn't too offended by having to go to the counter to place my order. I was amazed at the prices at this place. My friend and I spent just under $30, and we had a TON of food, AND I got a beer. We shared the fowl fingers app. The chicken itself was great. It's fried in a tempura batter, served with barbecue sauce, so it's definitely a unique offering. It sort of reminded me of dressed up sweet and sour chicken. The batter was really light and crispy, and the chicken was really moist. It was served on a bed of fries, which was a mix between regular and sweet potato fries. The regular fries were tasty and addictive. The sweet potato fries were sub-par, and I'm usually a big fan of sweet potato fries. Both our entrees came with salad. We both agreed that the salad tasted way better than it looked. The salads were not attractive. The lettuce was shredded. There is nothing froofy about the food here, but it tastes good.  I got mac n' cheese, which was very delicious, and was a huge portion. I could only eat about 1/3 of it. It was really creamy mac n' cheese- my friend thought maybe it has sour cream in it? I don't know. But it was delish. Topped with potato chips crunched up, which was weird at first, but it grew on me. My friend got a veggie burger, which I tasted. It was GREAT and very unique. It almost seemed like a potato pancake. It was not trying to imitate meat. The onions on it were also great. It came with chips that were quite good. All in all, I'd say this place has food that's a notch or two above diner food, with diner prices, so no complaints here. Our service was just fine. The ambiance is casual and comfortable. Not too fussy, not trying to hard. Just cooking up good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday. The ordering system is easy, you order and pay  at the counter and then go sit at a table. I remember the blueberry pancakes and sausage being really good."}
{"text":"Legit found a cockroach in my eggs Benedict. Flipped over, dead, on its back legs up in the air. All true. All I got was a coupon for a medium pizza. I honestly cant believe this happened to me. Never again. Horrifying. You've been warned. ALSO if you have less then 4 stars your restaurant automatically sucks so why would anyone want to to go here??!"}
{"text":"First of all, I do not know how they only have a 3.5 rating. I went on Sunday for brunch with my family and had a 5 star experience. For a coffee addict, their self serve unlimited coffee is godsent! I hate waiting for a server to top off my already luke warm cup after I have been waiting too long...and their brew is better than most diners I have been too, especially the cinnamon flavored.  My aunt and uncle, who are pretty picky, didn't have one negative thing to say. Before the end of the meal, they were already making plans to come back.  Pizza dough instead of bread for egg dishes?...genious. The poached egg soaked into the dough with whichever topping you choose: avacado, mushroom, crab, ham...oh so so scrumptious. We also ordered bluberry pancakes which were delicious. We did not leave hungry.   I can't wait to come back and try the sausage gravy!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place.  Had only been there for dinner until this Sunday.   I was blown away by their breakfast, and I'm not a huge breakfast fan.  By the time I thought to take a pic of my steak and cheese breakfast wrap it was too late because it was already GONE!  I love their variety of hot sauces and their extremely friendly service.  I normally wouldn't like the idea of ordering at the counter, but the employees there make it a seamless process!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood picking something up tonight, and wanted take-out so I stopped into Latitude 41N. There was no one there, but perhaps that is expected the day after Christmas. I ordered the \"Wait Until Next Year\" burger and the Tomato Bisque.  \"Wait Until Next Year\" - I ordered it medium well and it was perhaps very slightly under done, but nothing that I couldn't eat just fine. I thought this was a very good burger. The coleslaw was to my taste - on the sweet side but not overly sweet, and the fries topping the burger were nicely seasoned. My only real disappointment is that I couldn't taste the sharp cheddar at all.  Tomato Bisque - It tasted stale to me and when I checked the menu, I noticed that I overlooked the fact that it has blue cheese in it. To my palate, this was not a winning combination and I threw it out.   I'll definitely go back here for take-out again in the future as the service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Had a very good meal here a week or so back. The staff were very friendly, the environment was great. I did think it was a little bit pricy for what it was. Overall, 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is so hit or miss with food quality. It used to be one of my favorite places but over the years has started missing something. The cinnamon coffee is honestly what keeps me coming back. They could do with some new staff. The past four times I've been there, the staff attitudes have been so bad that it really puts a damper on the whole experience."}
{"text":"It's a unique place that has a good brunch. They do have champagne if you like mimosas as well. You go to the counter to order your food and then seat yourself. A runner then will bring it out to you. The portions are pretty big and the quality of food is very good."}
{"text":"We ordered the Ménage a Trois breakfast for $4.95. Best $5 breakfast I ever had. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Easy and fun place to go for breakfast or lunch. It's a pretty casual setting, but the food is great. They have both indoor and outdoor seating so it's pet friendly. You can order and pay at the counter. It has a friendly neighborhood feel and is a great place to be on a Sunday/Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Blast from the past, many memories. When I first moved to GSAD, I had no internet, or money for it. Smh. Latitude, saved my life. I had a lot going on with school and life in general. Their wifi was lifesaving.   I used to grab a coffee and relax, their sitting arrangement is amazingly comfortable, even during the frigid Cleveland Winters.   Now that I have went back since, they have upgraded a lot. Food menu has changed quite a bit. I usually only went for breakfast, so I cant sleak on their entire menu, but id definitely recommend going here on a quiet, slow day."}
{"text":"I wanted to dislike this place and in some respects I did and in some respects it really redeemed itself.  It's been years since I'd been to Latitude 41n.  I recall being just \"meh\" about the brunch there, so there really was little reason to go back.  I'd recently been hearing raves about it and I started to question my initial experience.  We arrive and you order food at the counter.  That's fine.  We sat ourselves but the table I chose had literally piles of sausage on the floor and the table had seemingly not been wiped off with a rag.  We switched tables.  Our new table had a light fixture that was held together with duct tape and it still didn't exactly feel \"clean\"  The food itself was actually really good.  Good sizes.  Good price.  Fresh food.  The staff seemed very helpful.  I just couldn't get the dirtyness and the decor out of my head.  The carpeting is gross.  The walls all have chipped paint.  It just doesn't look cared for.  If they fixed up the place, I'd be back.  Until a renovation though, I have plenty of other good options..."}
{"text":"The issue I have with Latitude is that they're very inconsistent. If I would have written my review after the first time I went there a year ago, it would have probably been 2 stars. More recently, I was back and after that experience, I was going to write my review and I had bumped it in my mind up to 4 stars, but MOST recently, they went down to 3. And, I figured that was the most fair rating just from the inconsistency!   The food and the service. Hit or miss. I've only had breakfast food. I absolutely LOVE the southwestern quesadilla. ABSOLUTELY delish. Pumpkin pancake. Yum. My friend loves the Lost omelet (spinach, portabella, feta) - me? not so much. I like that they now have regular shredded hash browns. I wasn't a fan of the potatoes they used to serve. If they make their french toast well, it's amazing! Seriously tastes like a cinnamon roll, vanilla glaze and all. But the most recent time I got it, it was overcooked, no glaze, and just tasted a bit blah. The service is just as random. I've had really good service and really rude, \"i'd rather be anywhere but here\" service. The busboys are always very nice.   The setup is different. You can grab a menu and a table until you decide what you want. Then just go up to the register and order and pay. When your food is ready, they'll bring it right out to you. Water, iced tea, and coffee is all self serve. WHICH I LOVE!   You can honestly easily spend a very small amount here, but you can also easily spend a LOT. Their menage a trois option Mondays thru Saturdays is the most budget friendly option! Eggs, hash browns, meat, toast, AND coffee! all for 4.95. And then for another DOLLAR you can add two more sides! WHAT?? Super cheap. But, I've also spent 19 dollars just getting the southwestern quesadilla, one pancake, and coffee.   Super convenient parking in the back and if there's nothing available, street parking is fairly easy to get.   They have a bookshelf with a  ton of books if you're just relaxing with a cup of coffee. And, if you have a little one, someone left a Frozen book that's on the shelf, so that should keep them busy if you ran out of toys :)   Overall, this place is okay. If someone else suggests it, or if I'm craving a breakfast quesadilla, I'll prob be back. I hope it's a hit the next time I'm there."}
{"text":"My family of 4 had breakfast here on a Saturday morning.  Deelicious.  Wonderful, laid back atmosphere.  You get your own coffee and water.  I had the West Coast omelet-bacon,cheese and avocado!  Yum!  My husband ordered some crazy cinnamon roll french toast. He said it was just okay. My daughter loved her pancakes. Not super expensive or really cheap. I think the prices are just right.  Oh yeah--they serve alcohol!"}
{"text":"Breakfast/brunch. Cure for hangover pizza. Guest got the ménage a trois. Great atmosphere in Detroit shoreway. You order at the counter then they bring it out to you. Water and coffee is self serve. Atmosphere felt like a high end diner but also could pass as a nice restaurant. Service friendly and looks like there are daily affordable specials I would come back again for."}
