{"text":"Back a second time. The lamb tikka masala roti was spectacular. Although medium-hot was not spicy enough. The Saag paneer is also highly recommended. No longer impressed with the butter chicken roti - the potatoes in the dish take away from the authenticity. Really rich and not enough of a tomato base. Don't miss the mango lassie."}
{"text":"Will not return.
2 hour wait for delivery.
Order wrong.
Food cold/roti mushy and inedible from sitting in container."}
{"text":"I love this place. The og butter chicken roti is delicious. Their spice level is on point. I usually get the medium, and I still get tears in my eyes half way through. I only give them a 4/5 because the potato to chicken ratio is at times too high. The staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Came here today on a walk home from the rock climbing gym. After spending hours at work, it was great to get something warm a hearty into me. Went with my go-to, Sag Paneer, and was warned about the spice. I usually go with medium for my \"spice level\" but the cashier warned me a medium would be really hot (an 8/10 vs the mild 5/10). I stuck to my gut and went medium. It was hot, but not as hot as she hyped it up to be. It was still delicious, and I'm sure I'll be back at some point. (But maybe getting the HOT option, haha)."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! I've been anxiously awaiting to try it since I saw it going in a few months ago. I was not disappointed!!

I am kinda picky about Indian food, and often drive out into the 'burbs for really authentic fare, and through my 15 years in the city I've tried pretty much every Indian place that has been reviewed well, and plenty that haven't looking for stuff that makes my mouth sing. Downtown it's Lahore Tikka House or nothing...but now I have Butter Chicken Roti!!

I had the saag chana roti & was really pleasantly surprised to see that they make each roti bread to order. The flatten the dough and fry it up - it's so fresh and tasty!

I really enjoy spicy food, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the medium spice was a great level of heat. Warmed the mouth, added depth, and even built up on you as you ate. By the end my nose and eyes were running, it was perfect! It's great that they let you choose your level of spice, because I find most downtown Indian places are too bland since they are servicing so many tender North American palates. Usually a let down for folks like me. But not here!

The spices were complex and well-incorporated. It was hot (even after a 45 minute trek home in the cold November rain), HUGE, and sooo tasty! 

I'm trying to cut back on my grain consumption for health reasons, and was sad thinking I could no longer have Indian food since I usually eat it with copious helpings of rice and naan, but having Butter Chicken Roti as a lower-starch alternative is FANTASTIC!

My boyfriend had a bite and was jealous since he'd eaten earlier. Right away he said we'd have to go back this weekend so he could have a whole one all to himself.

I'm really looking forward to trying their signature Butter Chicken Roti next time!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, not exactly Indian but the Canadian rendition to those flavors. We had to wait for more than one hour for a couple of rotis on a Saturday night. Incredible! Only two pans in the stove working... Broken fridge so not even cold drinks. We -and most of other customers- learn the lesson: never -ever- again... Nothing to do but wait if we paid upfront..."}
{"text":"Butter Chicken Roti - probably my least favorite dining experience from Toronto.

I'll give them props, when they say spicy, they aren't kidding around. Unlike the restaurants back home, these guys are serious about their heat levels. The chicken and lamb vindaloos have great flavor, but ordering it spicy was a mistake. The spiciness not only made it impossible to fully enjoy and actually eat, but, after a few minutes greatly diminished the flavor.

If the restaurant had air conditioning or fans to cool the place, this might have been an enjoyable experience. But the temperature of the building, mixed with only slightly chilled beverages made eating the freshly cooked vindaloo more of a trial than pleasure. The fruit lassi was barely cool, which in part defeated the purpose of pairing it with the vindaloo. 

Apparently they used to have raita on the menu. I'm not sure why they stopped offering it, but, it would have made the food edible. I barely managed a quarter of my vindaloo as there was nothing to offer a contrast/distraction from the heat.

I liked the presentation of the food and think it would go over well back home. It was more of a wrap to be eaten with a fork and knife, rather than the typical curry in a bowl. Id love to try this again, still spicy, but on a cold day, with rice, raita, and a cold beverage."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by a friend but it's not worth it at all. Being born and raised in India,  I have been eating butter chicken all my life and never have I come across any recipe that incorporates potatoes in a butter chicken. Nearly half the filling was potatoes. If I knew before, I would have never ordered it.

Avoid at all cost!"}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken roti here last night with my roommate. It was tasty, huge, and when you ask for \"very spicy\" you actually get it.

We stayed at the restaurant to eat for a bit, but the radio (Virgin Radio 99.9) was awful so we took the rest of our meals home. The food comes in nice resealable boxes though, so that wasn't a problem.

It's no Gandhi's, and I wouldn't eat inside the restaurant again unless the radio was off, but we'll definitely be getting spicy takeout from here again."}
{"text":"The prices for the roti may seem steep, but the portion is large and they do not skimp out on the filling - there's even more meat than potatoes in mine!
When you're ordering, make sure to watch out for the spice levels. I'm good with handling spice, but I can see the mild/medium level being uncomfortable to those who are not used to it."}
{"text":"I think the cooks may have knocked the salt shaker over their rotis because they are incredibly salty. A difficult achievement to oversalt food and still be tasteless.

I ordered the channa roti with extra spinach and although everything looked really good on the outside and inside, the taste was unbelievably bland. Would have been nice to have spices and flavours infused into the food, instead of thrown together and mixed in a bath of salt."}
{"text":"Always love their rotis. Always yummy and perfectly spicy! Some of the best rotis in town!! Always delicious Indian rotis."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that living nearby this roti restaurant!

It was few months ago that I started to eat butter chicken roti at college St location. I ordered butter chicken with mild-medium flavour.(3 types of spicy level) 

Compared to other roti restaurant, this one has definitely more chunks of chicken breast. It sure makes your roti enough big and heavy! Yummy

This location is new, Just opened last month, With same nice and comfortable atmosphere, very friendly cashier and same amazing, creamy, flavourful taste."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I waited 35 minutes for a roti. They even managed to mess up the order and were completely  unapologetic. Customer service only matched by the prices. Nearly 20$ for a roti and day old lasi. Not a fan can't think of any positives except that I wasn't as screwed over as the delivery guys from just eat."}
{"text":"It's good. If you enjoy roti this place is yummy. Good somosas too. Saag paneer is better at roti time but the butter chicken roti and fries are awesome."}
{"text":"Wowzers... Now I'm Punjabi & this roti is better then back home. This is the best East Indian delight Ever!  Watch out though even Medium will burn your mouth down, try to order in between Mild-Medium for the best spice unless your a daredevil or a Mistress of the Spices."}
{"text":"I have never had a better roti in my life.  I've had the chicken saag, the chana saag and the chicken kormi rotis and they've all been amazing.  This place is one of my favourite take-out spots on College St. now.  The portions are huge - you can buy one roti and eat half for lunch and half for dinner.  Although they are so tasty that I usually end up eating the whole thing in one sitting.

One thing I've heard (although I've only tried mild) is that if you pick any spice \"level\" higher than mild, you will regret it unless you like it really hot.   Lots of great selections for fillings - and they have vegan options too."}
{"text":"I used to walk past this butter chicken place every now and then but never ventured inside. Boy was I amazed at the stone oven baked tandoori rotis. The chicken was too spicy and I think I should have gotten mild instead of the hot. Just like the other reviewer I absolutely loved the mango lassi- you guys have the best recipe I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Tasty food Friendly service Clean restrooms.Repeat customer. No complaint ever. Always same quality standard."}
{"text":"Had the spinach roti, and I'm glad I ordered medium because they didn't kid around in the spice department.

I found the size and price to be quite comparable to Ghandi's on Queen, and like Ghandi's, each roti is more than enough for two meals. Between the two, the spice level seemed much hotter here.

Service was pleasant enough. You order and sit down until they call you to come back to the counter to pick up your meal, which comes boxed in a little cardboard container. I don't think they have table service. 

On the downside the texture of the filling seemed a bit mushy, but that might be owing to my choice of spinach. The texture of the second portion did seem a little firmer the next day.

I'll be back to try their namesake roti,  Butter chicken. Though when I do, I think it would be wise to go with 'mild' next time."}
{"text":"Addictive! Generous portions, great chef and wonderful curries!"}
{"text":"Well I love Indian food and eat it quite often, so Im used to the spices and have no problem digesting. Most of the time.... Last night I was in the area and needed to eat something quick. I saw this place, it looked clean, and new and 'hip' as the cool kids say, so I gave it a whirl. I got the Lamb Korma medium spice roti. 
Call me picky, but I have worked in the service industry for years, and its really not that difficult to smile is it? My god, i felt like I was interrupting this dudes evening by asking him a couple questions about the rotis. Sorry guy, ill take my roti and leave. Anyways, I ate half my roti  and packed it up and met up with some friends down the street. 30 min later my stomach was KILLING me. Like stabbing pains, and like someone was taking my stomach in both hands and squeezing it like a stress ball. I got some pepto, chugged and went to sleep. I woke up and it still hurts. Now i dont know if it was just a bad reaction or if it was the food in that place, but something didnt agree with me.  And the least they could do is smile and be friendly before handing me over something that is going to make me feel like I have a demon in my stomach."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 rotis for the first time from this place. I asked for mild/medium (2nd in a scale of 6 or 7), which you would think would be a safe bet. NOPE. I'm no stranger to spicy food - I travelled through India and Thailand with virtually no problems. 

But let me tell you this roti is so spicy that I literally cannot eat it. When I complained they did nothing to rectify the situation except offer me a free delivery coupon. Clearly this is an issue with inconsistency.

The person on the phone tried to tell me that the spice levels match those in India, which is a ridiculous statement. There is no standard spice system in India, and last I checked this style of Indian rotis are a North American bastardization of Indian cuisine. A delicious one, no doubt, but not exactly an \"authentic\"-style food that this person tried to make it out to be.

Own up to occasion inconsistency in spicing, Butter Chicken Roti, and you might make some new fans. But this girl's first time ended with a burning sensation I'm not keen to repeat."}
{"text":"Love this place. Every roti I have had is amazing, fresh, and a fair size!
I specifically love the saag paneer - it's my go-to. The samosas are also really tasty.
Warning - the spice is SPICY! Medium/mild is plenty for me, and I like hot!"}
{"text":"Super fast service. Their Signature Butter Chicken is always tasty and juicy. I love this spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! And love that they deliver, even though it's embarrassingly close to my house!!
My only criticism is that the spicing is uneven - I stick with mild/medium because their \"normal\" medium is crazy, but find that about 30% of the time it's less spicy than I wanted.
Otherwise it's excellent. The chicken korma is my fave, and my husband loves the lamb curry. Portion sizes are very generous... Easily two meals for me."}
{"text":"So, I have had the pleasure to dine in twice and take out once. Both times I was thoroughly impressed with their service, speed, taste, and quality of food.
The items I ordered: 

- SAAG CHANA ROTI - very tasty but I didn't take their words to heart when they said their temperature levels are off the charts. The hot is insanely hot. 
- BUTTER CHICKEN ROTI - Very tasty and definitely a good dish. I went to medium this time around. much better in terms of the heat. Flavor was good and the quality of meat they used was good.
- LAMB JALFREZI ROTI - really tasty as well and nicely prepared. However, my only knock on it is that they kept the fat on some pieces and I found that the strong lamb flavor came out a little more than I would like. 

Overall great food.

I would also like to add, that this last experience of mine was the best. Not because of just good food BUT I ordered in advance and mentioned that I would be dining in with my colleague and they had everything served and divided up perfectly for us the moment we walked in and had the biggest smile. 
The frontline staff genuinely make you feel welcomed and provide good service.

Thanks,"}
{"text":"Tried the tikka masala chicken roti here, medium hot. And I walked away impressed. 

It was filled with morsles of tender chicken breast and diced potato. The chicken was extremely tender and full of flavour. And if you know spice level, medium hot is precisely that. Enough to cause me to break a little sweat. And the roti itself was delightfully soft. 

I grabbed one for lunch, it was enough to last me for two lunches. Quite large, well worth the value.

The only downside was I'm accustomed to picking up my roti to eat, and it was not 'wrapped' but placed in a box take out container. Not the end of the world, but instead of eating it with my hands, I had to use cutlery. Thankfully the roti was soft, so it sliced easily"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, and to be honest only once out of those three times has it been a purely pleasant experience, and all three of those times I've received a notable helping of attitude from the staff.  The attitude ranged from the time their interac timed out and it was unspoken-yet-detectable that the cashier blamed me for it, to hostility over me asking for a doggy-bag to take the rest to go. There are other places to eat in the neighborhood, and this place has a palpable lack of enthusiasm to have your business. The roti's are HUGE so expect to take away half of it, but don't bother asking for a little extra sauce on the side. They won't even let you pay extra.  They simply won't allow it. The food is good, but I've honestly had a better Indian style roti, but their spice ratings are misleading.  I can handle extra spicy food in most cases, but their medium spice was nearly inedible to me.

Conclusion: Above average price, average food. Unpleasant past experiences. 
Recommendation: Find a better place to eat"}
{"text":"Food - (I love lamb dishes, but anal about how it is cooked)based on several dishes I had, i recommend Lamb Roti over any dish served here. They were all good but lamb roti was good enough to leave very good impression on the restaurant. Use of spices were bit over powering and some were a bit salty, but lamb roti in specific was well balanced to enhance the flavor of the lamb and reduced the pungent after taste.

Price vs quantity and quality - quantity is definitely worth the price, there are better butter chicken in toronto for sure but regarding the fact it's a franchise establishment, worth trying and creating your own opinion. 

Services - the gentleman that took my order actually brought food to me and was genuinely nice. Enough so that my girlfriend and I dropped 5 dollars in the tip jar. 

Atmosphere/setting/location size - the atmosphere seem to be catered to 'queen street vibe', hipster, sit in type of deal. Restaurant itself is small, not a lot of seatings. 

If you read up to this point, I've been there 5 times and they were all great experiences. There seem to be bad ratings as well but I highly recommend to try lamb roti for the lamb lovers."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place. Both times were good. Ordered butter chicken roti, masala fries, mango lassi and a samosa. The roti was huge, big enough to share with another person. Last time I ordered mild-medium spicy and thought it was too spicy but this time ordering mild felt like it could have used a bit of spice. I guess I like it somewhere between mild and mild-medium. Anyway, fries and samosa were fresh, crispy and not soggy. Prices were reasonable for what you get. Definitely my go to roti place now."}
{"text":"This place cut off the protein pinnacle of the food pyramid to make a depressing food trapezoid. 

Pros:
Wide selection of vegetarian options... including the meat ones.
There is adequate butter in the butter chicken. 
Within walking distance to better burritoed food options.

Cons:
Poverty protein will catabolize your heard earned gains.
Made to order = long waits, stiff vegetables.
Spicy scale depends on how you're racially profiled. Can vary from Michael Cera harmless to subcontinent fury.
The bright signage keeps me up at night."}
{"text":"I used to really like Butter Chicken Roti... until today. It's their 1st anniversary and they've been advertising all over the place 1/2 priced roti in celebration. 1/2 priced and 1/2 the size... that part wasn't advertised.

Kinda lame..."}
{"text":"Very delicious and huge portions! One dish can easily be shared between 2 ppl. Too bad it's far from me but I would return for sure. I had the butter chicken which was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent flavor and customer service. Atmosphere was clean. On the pricey side however, much worth it. For 2 rotis and 2 drinks cost us $32."}
{"text":"I am on a butter chicken phase and had been trying a lot of different butter chicken roti's downtown but this is by far the best I have been to. Recommend their signature butter chicken, it's delicious, their spiciness level is the real deal, and the portions are appropriate. Highly recommend it if you're an avid butter chicken fan!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 chicken curry roti from here through delivery and it was very bland. The curry inside the roti had no flavour and it was filled with mostly potatoes. I tried the chicken korma, chicken tikka masala and butter chicken roti. All of them were very bland and the chicken was very dry. The chicken tikka masala roti was the better one out of all 3.

Butter chicken roti: $12.95 plus tax
Chicken tikka masala roti: $12.95 plus tax 
Chicken korma roti: $10.95 plus tax

The Chicken roti is $15 with tax, people expect something more than dry chicken, bland curry gravy and a whole sack of potatoes.

Furthermore, when I was almost halfway throughout my butter chicken roti, I thought they had made a mistake and gave me a vegetarian roti. I didn't see or tasted any chicken. In the middle of the butter chicken roti, there's a few tiny pieces of chicken the size of cashews. Not only do they skimp on chicken, the chicken tasted dry and reheated. I understand in an Indian restaurant they make enough chicken for 2-3 days and that's the normal procedure. BUT if you know the chicken is dry, why would you still sell it to the customers. Makes me question what else is going on here.


Been here once for takeout and once for delivery, there's no one inside even on the weekend.

Probably would not come here again because the food quality and taste is very questionable and overpriced for what you're getting."}
{"text":"After walking past here many times, I decided to stop into this West Queen West roti place and see how it stacks up to the many roti places in Parkdale.

Butter Chicken Roti seems to have more variety of vegan options, and I opted to try the kale and chickpea roti.  After waiting for it to be prepared, I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the roti.  I could have easily made it into two meals, and the flavour was spot on.

Will definitely come back in the future so that I won't have to go all the way to Parkdale for a good roti."}
{"text":"Chicken Saag roti at medium has to be one of my favourite things in Toronto and is actually so close to how that dish should be made. The filling that is not the Roti itself. 

The chicken tika is also good and best of all you can order from these guys via uber if you do get lazy. The portion is really good and I rarely finish it in one go.

The place is fine to dine in too with plenty of seating."}
{"text":"My hubby is in love with this place. He'd eat it twice daily if he could justify it to himself. 

I, on the other hand, found the Butter Chicken Roti (their namesake dish) to be the epitome of \"Alright.\" I'm still carrying a torch for Banjara's butter chicken and have yet to find anything that comes close to its deliciousness. But it's decent!

There are two guys who seem to always be working there when we go (one Indian, one Caucasian), and the Caucasian one is now well-known in our household for sighing heavily when you place an order, and muttering \"For fuck's sake...\" under his breath when people in front of us place large orders. So I'd say customer service could do with a bit of a touch-up, but at the end of the day... long as we get our eats. ;)"}
{"text":"Came here a few times to try different rotis. Had the butter chicken as well as lamb masala and the vegetarian eggplant roti. Lamb masala was the best of the three, but watch out for the spice levels. Medium is not for the average Joe!"}
{"text":"Ditto on the the comments from everyone on spice level. Unless you are extreme, anything past medium makes it hard to enjoy the flavours after 2 or 3 bites. 

Medium is pretty hot.  I would personally like a bit hotter than medium, but the 2 times I got medium-hot, it was unbearable, so I stick with medium. For reference, at gandhi/mother india, I get hot. 

All the rotis we've tried have been excellent flavour. The vindaloo is not the flavour of vindaloo that I am used to at home (and I'm goan!!).  But it was tasty anyways. Tikka and butter chicken are excellent. 

May seem pricey, but it's really 2 meals unless you eat an exceptional amount of food. My wife and 2 daughters ordered 2 to share and were full after eating 1. So I think price is good with that in mind."}
{"text":"I had their main \"butter chicken\" (which oddly enough seemed to be offhandidly mentioned in their menu - it was pretty damn delicious, and pretty massive.

One thing - I asked for medium, and it was way hotter than that. I'm an immigrant and all that, so I'm used to some heat, but medium was more than just that.

I'd actually give it a 3.5 - I'd eat there again, but the serving size was so massive that I would only do it if truly starving."}
{"text":"I ordered one chicken roti, The roti took 30 minutes to come out (I was timing because i was actually in a rush and stressed out). The other people ahead and behind me also waited as long and were complaining. I really liked the roti itself, good for a curry craving, but my enjoyment was dulled by the unexpected wait. Friendly counter staff and tasty, I would just HIGHLY recommend calling ahead to place your order so you Arnt stuck waiting. Also I got the signature butter chicken roti at mild/medium spice. It was the perfect amount of spice for me. Just over $13 after tax. Also one was very filling, I got full 2/3 full but still finished it cause it was tasty haha."}
{"text":"I love the smell of the curries and spices as you walk into the shop. Perfect for takeout and conveniently located along queen st and ossington. The colours on the walls are very warm and inviting and I had very friendly service. You have to option for mild medium and extra spicy.. I went for medium and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This place opened down the road from me and so I'd been excited to try it out. I ordered the lamb saag roti and it was  delicious, although the roti wasn't as flaky on the outside as I would have liked. The lamb was tender and tasty. I wish I had read the other reviews before I ordered as I would have discovered that, firstly, the meals are big enough for 2 people and secondly, that this place doesn't mess around with the heat! I ordered mine mild-medium and it was almost too hot for me. My friend was happy with her chicken jalfrezie which was mild but had a kick to it too!"}
{"text":"I'm going with a pretty boring \"meh\". I had a butter chicken and a malai kofta. The BC had a bit of a brown-gravy kind of taste to it. My kids were with me and despite my convincing them that they can out-spice an adult they talked me into mild. Bad call and this may be accountable for the blandness but it shouldn't. As another reviewer noticed, it was a bit potato intensive. Even the potatoes had a bit of a stewiness to them rather than the greatness that is typical of an Indian potato. The malai kofta was better overall. Better gravy and more of what you asked for; i.e. since the MK filling is vegetarian they didn't feel the need to jam filler in it.

It's not better than the competitor up the street nor is it cheaper. I'm unlikely to return, but if I do it'll be again for MK and perhaps another vegetarian item since I think they are cheap on the protein."}
{"text":"My colleagues went there on Monday and enjoyed it. I got something with them on Friday. Apparently the butter chicken was better on Monday. I was not a fan of what was served either. Not the traditional butter chicken.. this seemed more cumin'ish than tomato based. I'll give them one more try.

$11.95 for a huge roti so it's definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"They were very friendly, so I feel bad I didn't like the roti more. I guess I'm just used to the Caribbean style roti. Yes, I know roti is an Indian flat bread. I just like what I like. It wasn't bad, but it just didn't do it for me. I will say the portion was huge, so if you're hungry and on a budget, have at it."}
{"text":"Went for the butter chicken roti for $13.99. When I was asked what spice level I wanted, I looked at the list and it started with Mild, Mild/Med, Medium, Med/Hot, Hot, Extra Hot, so I figured let's go with something in the middle and got the medium. She asked me if I was sure I was ok with that choice because it's \"really spicy\" and I'm thinking it's medium...how bad could it be.

So I received an order number and was told it will be ready within 15 minutes. Ended up taking less than 10 minutes, and the food is served in one of those plain cardboard takeout containers, wrapped in a plastic bag. I guess they just assumed I'd be taking it to go and prepared all of the items that I will need.

Food came out nice and hot. And by hot, I mean temperature hot. And that spice? It was definitely spicy. Not a numbing spice, but a nice flavourful spice that burns your tongue but tastes so good. I'd like to say I'm pretty good with spice, and so after a few bites I sort of got used to it. My tongue did not. Mild/med might be good enough.

The butter chicken roti was mostly potato, with maybe 10 pieces of chicken. The chicken was nice and tender, and the potatoes weren't too mushy and pretty nice to bite into. The inside was just stuffed with sauce and filling, so the roti was basically the only thing that balanced out the spice. Ended up eating it for two meals cause it's a pretty big portion (have to add some of your own veggies though cause it doesn't come with any)

This place doesn't play around with their spice. At a thai or korean restaurant in Toronto, their idea of mild might be like almost no heat for those that are pretty good with spice levels. This place just starts at the top and goes from there. If you can't handle heat, play it safe and go with a mild there is no shame in doing so. If you claim to be \"really good with spice\" and then complain that it's too spicy, you've probably only been dealing with restaurants that tone down their spice levels to boost your ego!

When I left, there was a group enjoying the burning sensation of their food and drinking lots of liquids. Seems like a good place to try some spicy food."}
{"text":"Pros: 
Menu is massive! The best thing about this place is that it can accommodate vegan, vegetarians, and meat eaters. 
The place is really clean and quite spacious. 
The portions of the roti are huge. 
The food is made fresh!
Cons:
Be prepared to wait a while. It takes about 10-15 minutes to get your meal. But keep in mind it's made once ordered. 
The stools by the window are strangely designed and are uncomfortable. If you're wearing shorts you'll probably leave with these geometric imprints on your legs."}
{"text":"The sign caught my attention because I love Indian food. I ordered the Chicken Curry roti and a Lasse. I wasn't impressed with service, the guy was nice but I said 'for here' and it took forever to be finished and he was ready to hand it to someone who had takeout that arrived after me. This annoyed me. They weren't that busy. I also was not informed that you could add extra toppings to your roti. I noticed the sign too late. I also think they should give some toppings for free. Your roti is basically curry sauce, potatoes and chicken and the other toppings are an extra .50-2.00 

I also agree with another reviewer about the Lassi drink. I've had better from the Square One food court. Lassi should be creamy as well. 

As far as people whining about spice.  Buck up, they explain it to you. Also, the super spicy, medium is more authentically Indian anyhow.  

This restaurant has potential but work on service and giving some free toppings and I'd be happy. Oh yeah, and learn how to make proper Lassi!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is good but I'm very dissatisfied and in fact still in pain and shock in how spicy the food actually was. Now, I want to make it clear that my ethnicity is East Indian, so I can handle spicy food. But I had no idea their spice level \"extra hot\" option was this deadly. I kid you not - I thank God we didn't end up in the hospital. Furthermore we couldn't even finish the food....it was so dangerously spicy that we had to throw it away. No restaurant should even offer 'kill the customer' spice level!!  I am shocked this restaurant does. Caution to anyone going to this restaurant: please DO NOT order the spicy extra hot option. And to the restaurant: Oh My Good God, please take this option off your menu!!"}
{"text":"So I had a craving for roti, and Bacchus Roti in Parkdale was closed, so I found this place on Ritual. My boyfriend had the butter chicken roti which was delicious. We saw the other reviews and got a mild/medium which equated to the medium spice that we like. I got the curry roti, which wasn't as flavourful, but still good. I saw other complaints of not enough chicken, but our rotis had a good amount of filling. No complaints, but I probably wouldn't crave this place like I crave other roti establishments."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch, and like already mentioned on here, the service was definitely too slow (with a group of around 8 just beating us to ordering) so don't come in here if you only have 30 mins or so for your lunch break. But on a very slow day, I'm sure it won't take long for the kitchen to have your order ready, The good news is that it is delicious and the portion is large, but for over $10 for a stuffed roti, I would have been very irked if the size was any smaller. I went with the chicken tikka masala in the spiciest sauce, and I can safely say that it could have been the spiciest thing I've had in Toronto, definitely the spiciest Indian dish I've had. So next time I might take it a little lower and go for their butter chicken because I had a bite of it and unlike the extremely creamy dish I see in most Indian restaurant  the butter chicken here was nicely balances and not too overwhelming. I also enjoyed their mango lassi, not too sweet which I prefer and only $2.

The restaurant itself is very spacious, not a lot of seating, and it's more \"social seating\" with a communal table and a large bench by the wall shared by a few tables. So I recommend this for groups of no more than 4 to get a good shot of sitting together. 

Overall, definitely worth another go to check out some of the other menu choices and hopefully they figure out a way to speed things up just a bit at busier times."}
{"text":"Much spicier than expect. Had the lamb vindallo but had the butter chicken in the past and loved it.  Nice selection while keeping it all roti."}
{"text":"Anniversary special roti for 5.99$ was amazing. The size of the roti is big enough, very filling. Ended my meal with mango lassi, perhaps the tastiest I have had in Toronto...you can tell its fresh!!!"}
{"text":"As a Mexican used to eat spicy food I must warn you, the medium spicy was strong, it made me sweat and order a cold tea. Can't imagine how the toughest level is.

The place gave me the impression of being in a fast food Indian franchise. Although the jars full of spices gave a nice touch of authenticity, the set up, the containers, and the fact that they just offer Rotis put in my mind that Rotis might be the Indian burrito.

The Roti I ordered was ok, it tasted like spicy spinach with potatoes. I couldn't taste any other spice.

On the other hand, the bite I had of the lamb vindaloo was fantastic. Loved all those tangy flavours and the consistency. I would recommend it.

I also liked the masala fries, crunchy and creamy in the inside.

It's a good place if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to this place and last time. Some staff members acted like the didn't want to be there. There was only one samosa option which was vegetarian and it sucked. The filling was mushed lentils and a couple pieces of potato. There was so flavour to it but I have to say the egg roll wrapping was delicious. 

For the Roti it self. I had the lamb curry roti and honestly it was ok. The lamb was great, not over cooked and I could taste it. But the spiciness of a medium was way too much. I couldn't enjoy tasting my food cuz my mouth was on fire. Even though I like spicy that was no fun. 

I might comeback to try it again but other then that nothing special about it."}
{"text":"The Rotis here are stuffed with goodies. We ordered in advance for pick up to take away twice now, although they do have clean tables and seats available for you to enjoy there. The guy working cash there is extremely nice and provided us with many utensils when requested.

What I love about this place is the customization of spiciness and also the many types of curry and meat that you get to choose for your freshly made roti. So many choices, what's not to love? You can order a different meal each time you visit.

Although the price is relatively high for Indian food, it's worth it because it's delicious and the amount given is great. They don't skimp on the insides of the roti. Also the roti itself is pretty good, eat it while its hot.

I should point out that there was a bit of a delay in picking up our food because they had so few employees working, but food was well worth the wait...

My personal recommendations: Meat = chicken or shrimp, Spiciness level = hot, Curry = jalfrezi or saag or vindaloo or tikka masala. Their butter chicken is pretty good too, since you can make it spicy. Would go back when in the area!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! The food is tasty fresh and fast. The owner is so lovely and incredibly hard working. I'm so glad they're expanding. I'm really upset about the fire because I will be missing out on some great rotis! I hope they reopen soon. The rotis are very hefty I usually only eat half of one if I'm hungry. The spice is generous. Some may call me a spice aficionado. Usually I'm asking for extra spicy but here I'm very content with a medium. I love the mixed vegetable, a chicken jalfrezi or the shrimp saag. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mutter paneer roti, mild-medium spicy, and masala fries. The fries were literally just fries with a spice blend and were 100% not worth it. They were crispy and whatever but just didn't add anything to the meal. The roti was served piping hot, so that was good. Unfortunately, the spice was overwhelming. It's a cool gimmick, but the fact that the second-lowest spice level was almost painful to eat makes me wonder why anyone would bother.

The roti had minimal paneer and was filled with potatoes and peas. Like, it was ridiculous. I tend to shrug off reviews that talk about how a place tries to fill you up on cheap carbs so they don't have to give you the good stuff (because that's kind of how things work), but this was really noticeable. I kind of wish I had ordered something less vegetal to compare, because the peas really got in the way. I ended up with like 65-70% of the actual roti bread left, filled with sauce and peas, because I just didn't like it. Too spicy, not particularly good flavor, outright bad distribution of fillings.

This place was super forgettable and not good and I only remembered to write a review once someone wanted to go back and I had to express my revulsion. Pass."}
{"text":"So good. I'm in Toronto and wanted something quick and delicious and this hit the spot. I was staying by the airport and drove all the way here to try it based on the reviews alone and I got lucky! This place is great! I got the butter chicken roti and was not disappointed. The chicken is delicious, I love the potatoes in the wrap and it is spicy! Whew! If you are spice adverse be cautious. I like spice and usually order medium or even medium-hot when I get Indian. I got mild-medium and holy smokes! The perfect amount but very spicy still. This place is a must try for take out, dine in or delivery!!"}
{"text":"TLDR; Tasty, spicy food served quick. Interior is a little psychedelic.

I'm not a roti expert, but the roti was made fresh to order, the chicken was tender and the spices were tasty so we enjoyed it. Not much else to say about this place.

Interior is pretty funky (not in the best way). There are lots of colors, patterns, and textures happening in there."}
{"text":"Wanna have a near death experience over dinner? Order anything from Butter Chicken Roti, but ask for EXTRA HOT. The reviews are true, asking for extra hot is code for, \"I've got a death wish.\"  You will not continue to be alive if you eat an entire extra hot roti-- there's no way. I broke a sweat, my nose dripped only a few bites in. The spice was so intense I could feel my hairline peel backwards and recede after I rinsed w mouth wash.  You've been warned, extra hot from Butter Chicken Rotis is lava on the way in AND out. On the flipside,  the portions are extremely generous and so will the amounts of toilet paper you'll need after the meal...

This food was so spicy it was ridiculous... I'm still on that. Can't get over it.  It's been 3 days and I still have so much of it in my fridge.  How could anyone eat that much fire unless they had some sort of tastebudectomy? This spice isn't even made with the flavorful scotch bonnet peppers, it's just pure fire. The box is big and the meal is heavy and you get a lot of veggie mush with some meat chunks peppered in.  I'd say the meat, mush ratio needs improvement. After 5 tablespoons of extra hot mush, I can't even with the 4 chicken chunks.That's not a good ratio!

I think this place would be great for a health nut but not your standard roti, west indian food seeker. It's kinda bland.. they've got a big menu, maybe I just haven't found the right roti for mee 
4 stars!"}
{"text":"Over Priced and over hyped
Stuffed with potatoes (in the butter chicken roti)
Medium was like a Spicy"}
{"text":"Love these Indian Rotis.The curry is delicious, we have mostly called them for delivery and the food is always hot. The only word of caution is that they are very spicy, mild/medium is going to be enough unless you like exceptionally spicy food. Try it!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, It was filling and tasted amazing, It was ready pretty fast too, Very little wait.

I would have given 4 stars but my butter chicken rotti and a can of coke came to just under $15. Pretty pricey."}
{"text":"Stopped at random whilst walking on Queen Street. Impressed with menu, and the fact you can order the spicy level you want. Had a mild chicken korma roti, BF had medium vindaloo. Both excellent, large portion size. Also had a mango lassi - yummy. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Unbelievably poorly run company.  Great food.  A shame that they can't deliver anything in one piece.  They are selling curry and use cardboard paper boxes.  It leaks everywhere.  And don't order on the website.  It will charge you money and take your order and give you an eta but when it doesn't show up an hour and twenty minutes later and you call them they tell you that \" um the website isn't working and ummm it shouldn't be letting you order\" and that was two orders over the course of a
month  with the same excuse.  So as good as the food is we are now done after being regular customers for about a year."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, it's good if you're in the mood for Indian food and need it inside you ASAP. However, every time I asked for rice instead of roti they still put the curry in a roti (with no rice). So frustrating but still delicious so I can't cry that hard."}
{"text":"the tastiest. chicken vindaloo with extra chicken is pretty much living life at its fullest."}
{"text":"Ordered Jalfrezi roti spicy & lord gawd it was fricken spicy & delightful 
Enough for 2 peeps
They should put Irish Moss drink on the menu to neutralize the heat?"}
{"text":"Beautiful! Hits the damn spot.

I always get the signature dish, butter chicken roti. Totally delicious.

Note: this stuff packs some serious heat. I usually order spicy things \"medium\" but the medium here is actually HOT. The hot (never tried it) will likely scorch your esophagus and melt your face.

However, having said that, the \"mild\" isn't punchy enough! So they split the difference and offer an ingenious compromise: \"Mild-Medium\". Perfect."}
{"text":"I heard of this place from a coworker and have had the opportunity to try it twice.

I've tried the signature butter chicken roti and the chicken korma roti. They are both very good. The sizes are very large and enough to share with 2 people if you also get fries.

I've gotten the mild-medium spice level and would recommend that if you are not sure how spicy to get. I would say their spice rating is reflective of indian spicy, which I think can get very very hot!

Great place to check out, decor is very nice/hipster, a lot of seating. Mango lassi is worth trying as well as they do a good concoction."}
{"text":"This place only serves Roti/Curry, but you can have rice instead for the same price which is good.  Different curries are of different quality - I prefer the TIkka Masala over the signature Butter Chicken which has waaay too much butter.  You can eat inside, but it is pretty basic, most people do take out, especially for lunch hour.  Good to find one more good Indian place on West Queen West except Mother India at Lansdowne."}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery...

Wow... Shakes head..  

Food came literally half slopped out of the box...

Fine I'm easy.. Put it in a bowl and I lost some..  So what..

When I put the first bite into my mouth I couldn't believe just how tasteless this roti was... NOT to mention it was in about 1cm of water... I wish I took a picture but I was that starved I couldn't even think about much else...

Anyhow.. This makes one of my worst top 10 restaurants and definitely the worst Indian I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Wanted to review after having eaten lunch from here a few times.   Over all verdict - pretty average.    I have had their vindaloo and curry roti, yes they are spicy which is a plus, but other than hot, they do not have much other flavouring which is a difficult thing to achieve in curries. Both became one note after a few bites.   

Good value for the dollar though, $12 for a large roti easily large enough for two meals and good for fulfilling a craving.  Decent if in the ineighbourhood"}
{"text":"Came here lunch had the vegan cauliflower and potato roti - the selection of vegan titis is wicked! The spicy level is accurate - I love hot and spicy but the waiter warned me to to try the medium /level 3 - it was perfect for me but would be too spicy for most.

I loved the portion size - I feel like I could have shared this with someone but I had lunch and super with a 10$ Roti 

Delilah and affordable with amazing vegan choices"}
{"text":"I had been hesitant to order because the stylized sign etc seemed unauthentic, but I was very pleasantly surprised by this place. The rotis were fresh and flavourful and had a good ratio of inside to outside. I found the roti to be much better than at other places (not soggy at all, even with delivery via hurrier). Samosa are also good here, albeit a bit over fried. We ordered most things mild and the butter chicken mild-medium - don't think you need to go much hotter than that, even if you really love spicy food."}
{"text":"Started with a 5 star review but brought it down to 4 ironically for the same reason I dig it. The spice levels are bordering on masochistic. I was waiting for my order one day and noticed an older Indian man insisting that they had too much spice in their non-spicy/regular curry chicken roti. (As if you needed more reason to believe how spicy it is...) Of course I didn't try his roti so who knows right?  

I order the same thing on another visit and yup - still spicy. Would appear there is no escape from spice here. Bottom line. Don't expect to be able to bring you grandparent/parent with the stomach problems unless you want them to get an ulcer. If you yourself have a phobia of stomach ulcers I'm going to recommend that even if you're saaay-- doing construction nearby it wouldn't be wise to go here more than 3 times a week and I hate to say it. Still 4 stars good despite all that...the Samosa's are top notch, worth coming in for those on their own even.

Good eating all!"}
{"text":"I actually dined in at their other (now closed) location at Bathurst St and College St. 

I feel like I have to post a review about their food.  I dined in with my friend and we tried their signature butter chicken and lamb jalfrezi. 

I had to try the butter chicken roti hence the name of the restaurant.  The chicken was boneless and tasted flavourful and really good. However, I prefer the lamb jalfrezi over it.  The lamb jalfrezi came with lambs, cauliflowers, green peas and potatoes in curry sauce.  I personally like this more just because there are more toppings/variety of food in the roti. 

I usually like spice and can tolerate it well.  The servers told us about the different spice level and we were warned.  Anyways we got medium spice for roti and we were spiced up. We were literally wiping our nose after each bite."}
{"text":"I met up with pal here for dinner on a cold Saturday night. We had planned this meeting a month in advance so I had A LOT of time to hype up this meal in my head. My mistake. I first noticed their first location on College while riding the streetcar, but then discovered that a second location newly opened on Queen (around where my pal lives). It could have been due to abnormally cold weather,  but we were the only patrons in the restaurant (with a couple of people coming in to pick up their orders). I had the original butter chicken roti with green peas. This could be due to me choosing the mild flavour, but I found the roti to be a little bland. It was also not too warm. Overall, my experience was a-ok; not amazing, but it wasn't terrible as well.

Good for: roti, samosa, take out"}
{"text":"Indian on Queen St W  The $12 portion is big enough to share (because you're obviously going to get a samosa each too ?) 

It's yummy and comes inside the roti, weighing about 2lbs! I've tried the mango yogurt drink, samosas (a must order for me when I have Indian food), I've had the chicken jalfrezi & the butter chicken, both were good but I preferred the jalfrezi (chicken, peas, potato & cauliflower). 

It's quick lunch option if you're looking to branch out from your usual. 

MILD MEDIUM is spicy enough, I'm glad the cashier prompted us when we said 'medium' because it was the perfect heat. I think anymore would've taken over the flavor. 

Note: the drinks are all about $3+"}
{"text":"Tried a little bit of their Lamb and Chicken Vindaloo and Shrimp Tikka Masala Roti,
The Vindaloo's were great. The flavor of the curry was awesome. 
We had order a spice level 3 and although i can handle really spicy foods, this had my mouth on fire. I would highly recommend go with spice level 2 or lower and work your way up.
But definitely also try their Masala Fries.
2 thumbs up, but be very careful of their spices. Can't wait to try them again."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews, but this place has earned it.

My first experience of this place is when my roomate ordered a medium butter chicken roti. The medium was the spiciest thing i have ever tasted in my life, and I love spicy food.

I thought they possibly messed up and spilled the whole bottle of cayyenne pepper into the roti and served it anyway.

I decided to give it another shot, ordered it medium-hot. I guess i should not have been suprised but it was legitmately unedible.

I wasted my money, and i havnt even mentioned that they refuse to give you a decent portion of chicken.

this place sucks, find a better roti elsewhere."}
{"text":"By far the worst food in Toronto. Not only are the ingredients horrible, they actually make you feel sick.

Please support other legitimate places in the area an do not eat here."}
{"text":"After a busy day in downtown I decided I wanted something to eat where it reminded me of back home but it gives the kick where only certain people could enjoy it. I was surely mistaken.. Because with their variety in the menu everyone can enjoy their food! Especially those who were trying spicy food for the first time as there are different levels of spices you may ask for in your food. The food was fresh as well as the vegetables that were given to us on the side. Having such fresh indian food with a kick is not something we get here everyday! Very refreshing, very authentic flavours. Priced right according to the area!"}
{"text":"Pretty good curry (I got saag paneer), although I didn't like the roti wrap itself. I really appreciate that \"hot\" was actually really spicy! 

The samosa ($1) was not good and I definitely don't suggest getting one. The dough was really thick.

There was a lot of seating, which was nice. Prices are reasonable given that the rotis are big enough to serve two people."}
{"text":"Was charged $1 more for the chicken tikka masala roti than the menu said. No biggie, except the kid behind the counter didn't seem to care when I pointed it out. He also told me that medium spice was \"quite spicy\", but couldn't tell me how their spice levels compared to Gandhi's because he had never tried theirs.

When I got the roti home, it was more spice than substance, and the thick sauce was the deep red of canned pizza sauce. I'm not saying that's what it was...but it was the first thing that came to mind when I cut the sucker open. The kid was right - it WAS spicy...but it was almost as if they were trying to make up for the absence of flavour.

With so many better, more authentic options in the city (heck, in the neighbourhood!), I should have known better. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Admittedly, last night's dinner was my first-ever roti. It was also concequently the first time that, a la Lisa Simpson, I could see through time. I like my heat but holy hey, that \"medium' was suicide-wing level. One star removed for having to deface the delicious flavours with ketchup to help it go down. 

(Side note: The masala fries were fantastic, and did not require any sort of ketchup dousing.)"}
{"text":"They take their spice levels pretty darn seriously here. I'm usually a medium when it comes to hot sauces and curries; I like a flavourful, not painful heat. The first time I went to Butter Chicken Roti, I went for medium, despite the better judgement of the man behind the counter who very diplomatically asked if I'd ever had their rotis. Of course I tried to be a hero and stuck to my guns. I'm not proud to admit I spent my entire meal sweating and cursing my ego. All to say, the spice levels are in increments for a good reason. I now go for a Mild/ Medium instead of a medium and it's much more enjoyable. Lots of vegan and vegetarian options here and their rotis are very reasonably priced - especially when you take into consideration the portion size which is MASSIVE. A $10 curry in a pocket is substantial enough for lunch and dinner. There is seating in the restaurant but usually I just pick it up on the run. It doesn't take long for them to make. They have a lovely mural on one of the walls with an 'East meets Queen West' theme - hand painted by a local artist I would assume. Way to support your locals guys! Stay focused on that mural though because longer you look at the decor, the more confusing it gets. 
Keep those rotis coming! Maybe one day I'll work myself up to a medium... dream big."}
{"text":"I checked out Butter Chicken Roti, a new roti restaurant in our 'hood.  They have another location on College Street and just opened this one last week.  They are where Burger Bass was for a few seconds.

I ordered a boneless chicken curry roti and a pop and it was $12.35 (including tax). They only accept cash.  It came in a cool box.  I love love love rotis and this one was just okay."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I like how the food is totally prepped in a take out box for easy take-out, eating and clean up, so you can order it and then eat it on the street or in a park. You don't really have to worry about your hands getting messy as you open containers with lids flying away, and stuff. 

It takes a really long time to get the food ready, though, like 30 minutes + . If you're picking it up, you should 100% call it in first so it's ready, otherwise you're standing around for a really long time."}
{"text":"Too spicy. I ordered the medium/hot Bc generally I can take spice...but it's just to hot to enjoy. The other person couldn't eat their meal and I couldn't finish mine! Order the mild or medium at most - unless you have some sort of crazy spice tolerance."}
{"text":"Ordered the Lamb Tika Masala Roti.  Lamb itself was decent, tender a bit fatty which is good as most places the meat tends to be really dry.  However, there was very little of it.  I would say percentage wise when you order a roti, 60% of it is the roti, 30% sauce, 5% potatoes, and 5% lamb.  the taste itself was okay, the roti nothing special.  At $14 I'd just be thinking about how little protein I'm buying."}
{"text":"Ugh, frik this place. Honestly, their ratio of BS filler ingredients, i.e. potatoes & peas to the good stuff i.e. Paneer, chicken, Shrimp is flipping whack. I've been here twice and got MAD SHEISTED on chicken and paneer, yea, the rotis are big, but its 90% cheap shit like potatoes and 10% of the protein you should be paying for. Like, get the fuck outta here guys. First time I went here I got the butter chicken roti, and that shit was basically all potatoes ya,ll and I paid like 15 bucks for it? And the pieces of chicken were fucking little baby pieces that an infant would spit at and be like \"What the shit is this shit ya fools?\" So I held a grudge for a year and promised I would never go back.

Then yesterday I was walking by and the smell emanating from this place was too good to resist so I was like \"OKAY BUTTER CHICKEN ROTI HERE IS YOUR SECOND CHANCE.\"

I went for the Mutter Paneer and asked them to \"hold the potaties and make it saucy\" and what I got was a FUCKING PEA ROTI. It was absurdly over packed with peas, like straight up exploding with peas, WHO WANTS TO EAT A FUCKING ROTI COMPRISED ENTIRELY OF FUCKING PEAS. It was an atrocity. And yet again, maybe a total of like 7 pieces of paneer.

The cook here is a sheister and this time I AM NEVER COMING BACK."}
{"text":"Ordered the Signature Butter Chicken Roti - Medium spice level. 

I can handle spicy-extra spicy at most restaurants. The Medium spice level was insane. My mouth felt like it was on fire. 

The butter chicken isn't really traditional butter chicken. Felt like a place that just serves mediocre 'butter chicken' - The art work inside the store is nice and intriguing. 

Not bad, might be back if I get bored of other places"}
{"text":"Food is decent price, tasty and pretty good quality. Service was pretty slow, seem to priotize their delivery orders over walk-ins"}
{"text":"Just thinking of this place makes my mouth water!!
I've tried the lamb masala and the butter chicken roti and they're so goood.

I'd say to be careful to challenge their spicyness because it truly is spicy which made me have to chug two fantas and take breaks inbetween eating--and I'm usually the type to add hot sauce in everything."}
{"text":"Butter chicken Roti is very flavourful and yummy!  
This place has a lot of street parking which is great.  
The only downfall was how freezing it was in there at 12:30pm.  BRRRRRRR - I had to leave my coat on."}
{"text":"I love spicy food but be careful when you order here, their spice levels are intense.  I would recommend ordering a level down what you would normally order for your first visit. My boyfriend and I couldn't finish our meals (he got medium hot and I had medium). I will try it again because the curry was tasty."}
{"text":"Oh my god, I love Indian food, and if I'm starving, I'll totally daydream about the big rotis I can get from here. I'm thinking about them right now... *drool* It is like a meal and a half, for me.

I hope this place is here forever, because I don't think I can get a closer or more tasty Indian curry fix as this."}
{"text":"This is another College restaurant I've been watching go up on my morning streetcar ride to work. Finally, today was the day I made lunch plans to head to Butter Chicken Roti! 

Being a huge fan of Gandhi's, but working too far away to make it a feasible lunch option, I was pretty excited when I saw Butter Chicken Roti (let's go with BCR from now on) - it's only 15 minutes away, which is totally doable for lunch! 

Upon arrival, I was happy with what I saw - a few smaller tables and a communal table. It has a casual feel - you go up and order and pay at the cash, choose a seat, and let the waiting commence. Perfect for a quick lunch.

The menu has a decent selection of vegetarian, chicken, lamb, and shrimp rotis, as well as a few other side options such as fries. I decided to go with my heart and order their special dish - the butter chicken roti, in mild (of course). At $12 compared to $10, I was hesitant, because I was already feeling like perhaps prices were a bit steep. I also added on a $2 mango lassi, which was tart and delicious, and tided me over while I waited. 

And wait we did. A group of 6 had come in before us, so the cashier let us know to expect a 10-15 minute wait (we had already ordered, what choice did we have!) but I think it stretched into about a 20 minute wait. In addition, a few other people had ordered my lunch dish, so it was a great disappointment every time my order was called, but then wasn't mine! A number system is definitely in order from them. Since the restaurant wasn't even half full, they should think about getting another chef - BCR quickly was being written off as a lunch place after that wait. 

When i finally got my giant, delicious roti, I was starving! It was quite good, but at $12 and waiting 20 minutes, it wasn't really worth it, and I'm not tempted to go back any time soon. 

Unless they make some changes to their pricing and wait times, I am disappointed to say I'm not sure how long BCR will last - but here's hoping it becomes a more viable lunch option as time passes and they work through the kinks, and roti can become a more regular part of my diet!"}
{"text":"I had the saag chicken roti and tried a bit of the chicken korma curry roti. The thing is absolutely massive. It weighs and looks like a brick sitting in its cardboard box. It's packed with a piping hot filling and the aroma that escapes as you first cut into it is quite tantalizing. The romance wears off with the second or third bite as you realize you're just eating starch.  

My biggest issue was with the roti itself. I found it too leathery rather than soft and doughy. I also wished that the chicken was more of a slow cooked and tender variety as opposed to chewy.

Come with an appetite, a big one."}
{"text":"I have tried the butter chicken and malai kofta roti. I usually enjoy vegetarian Indian dishes more than non-veg, so I will start off by saying that I preferred the malai kofta based on flavour and abundance of ingredients. The butter chicken really only had a few pieces of chicken and potato. It was all sauce. I did not enjoy the butter chicken. It tasted strange. 

Now, for the fun part. That heat level though - wow. Growing up on South Asian cuisine, I've always enjoyed spicy food and would say I have a good tolerance of it. But if it's to a point where the heat overpowers the flavour of the dish, I am not a fan. When I ordered my dish for delivery, I asked for a medium-hot spice level. That, to me, seems as is says: medium, but with some heat. It was ALL HEAT. I only got a few milliseconds of flavour with each bite, until the fire took over my mouth. I tried getting through my meal as best as I could but I was also in physical pain, and I did get sick afterwards. It's as though the restaurant adds heat to mask what they're lacking in flavour perhaps???? Based on other reviews, it seems that the servers caution their diners that anything above mild-medium is usually too hot - so why offer so many subsequent spice levels after that?? The spice, and maybe the quality of the chicken but I'm not sure, can make you ill. 

That being said, I did enjoy the flavour of the malai kofta, and if I were to ever eat here again I would ask for a mild-medium spice level. If you order hot or extra hot, it's your funeral!"}
{"text":"My God. I ordered a medium hot butter chicken roti. Im from Kolhapur, a city in India that eats the spiciest food. But this medium hot had me crying. I wonder how their hot and extra hot might be. This isn't what I'd recommend. All I could taste was spice, and not the good kind. Bad memory."}
{"text":"when me and my friends 1st went in the place was so empty and the girl who took our order was extremely rude, we order butter chicken rotting which was supposed to be their signature dish and waited around 15 mins for the food and it was an absolute disaster, the quality of the chicken was horrible and the rotti was also bad, we paid over 15 dollars for the butter chicken rotti and I absolutely regret going there and would highly recommend people to not go there. Horrible service Expensive prices, extremely low quality chicken and horrible food."}
{"text":"A disclaimer, I'm a vegetarian so I've only ever had a few of the Rotis on the menu namely the Saag Paneer and the Mutter Paneer. I'm not typically a spicy food eater, but I like the medium spice here, it is quite spicy but still flavourful, the Paneer alleviates some of the spices. The Saag Paneer is amazing, a perfect size for a hearty eater like myself . I've brought both my big appetite friends and my Guyanese friend here and they both loved it for the portion size and the spice. The last six months I've noticed, it has become extremely popular and the wait time used to be 10-15 minutes, now it's closer to 30 minutes and the front counter staff are not at all friendly and if you don't like Drake or douchey hip hop and r&b it's not a pleasant in store wait. They don't always tell you how many orders are ahead of you, so you might think great there are 3 people in the store, I should get my food quickly, only to realize there are a dozen online takeout orders ahead of you. The problem here is the business seems to have made the decision to sell their food via a number of take out websites and screwed over their in store customers, simply put the pace of demand outstrips the speed of supply. The owners of this place need to figure something out and soon, the kitchen is so small I can't think of any possible way they could speed up production and maintain quality."}
