{"text":"If you go to Lowes on Boulder and Horizon, this is a great way to get a great snack. 

I'm sure most people can relate to a time when you woke up early and started a project around the house. You start making some good progress the you realize you need more supplies. You decide to run down to Lowes, its around lunch time, you haven't eaten yet and definitely worked up an appetite. But for some reason it didn't hit you until you were in the middle of shopping. After you check out and exit the building, you smell a nice aroma of something being cooked on a grill. This is where the debate with yourself comes in. Trying to decide if you want stop here or head back home and make a boring sandwich. Trust me, you should stop. These guys are extremely friendly and ready to cook you up sometime nice. You won't be disappointed. 

On a side note; the burgers the did awhile back were absolutely amazing. As of this review, they only have hot dogs, polish dogs and Italian sausages. The Italian sausage is something to write home about!"}
{"text":"Awesome dogs and brats! Can't wait till they bring their homemade burgers back too. I can't go to Lowes during the weekend without stopping for a bite. Great job...thanks!"}
{"text":"So awesome! Me and my boyfriend got one each at first. He got a chili cheese dog and I got plain with a side of chili (because it looked so good!!) oh man, we were in heaven. We devoured ours and went back for seconds. I'm pretty picky with my chili. I LOVED IT! Best chili I've ever had! Loved it all! We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff. You can tell they use good hot dogs and brats not just cheap hotdogs. Was actually a really good brat hot dog they cooked it on the grill right in front of me and everything looked super organized and clean. I would go out of my way to get hot dogs there especially cuz the owners are real cool people. Super nice and friendly not there to just sell hotdogs they actually care about cooking good food even if it is just hotdogs which is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING, I am from Utah and I had my favorite hot dog stand there, when I moved here I tried several places and was disappointed... Until I went to Lowes and tried Sucker-Punch Grill! The manager is an extremely nice guy, funny too, and he keeps a clean place. It's very welcoming and convenient for DIYers.

His brats are the best! I love how he grills up the veggies too. I have taken a few people here and everyone says they will be back! Thank you Sucker-Punch Grill for the great experience, I will be back :)"}
