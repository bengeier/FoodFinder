{"text":"If I'm at Kent and I want a quick, healthy, tasty meal I go to Troy, they are super friendly.. I love the chicken shish, it's the best, also I always order waffle and Turkish coffe."}
{"text":"Different and delicious. Haven't had anything that wasn't great, and the kofta and falafel are favorites. You'd really be hard-pressed to find something that wouldn't accommodate every dietary need or preference.  It can take a little bit to get your food but that's because they don't start the cooking process until you order.  It can be confusing on your first visit - you'll give your meat/falafel order first (usually Chef G will come out and get that) and then someone will build your base (wrap/bowl/salad) after that and set it aside until Chef G comes out with your cooked meat in a giant scoop."}
{"text":"I love the fresh food and atmosphere at Troy! It is nice to have this local, family owned business in downtown Kent, which is becoming more rare these days.  The owners are always friendly. I've never had a bad meal, everything is exceptional. My personal favorite is the Chicken Istanbul. They now carry diffrent Turkish chocolates and coffees. Highly recommended for anyone who is in Kent, Ohio."}
{"text":"Amazing food and clean environment. They have very friendly staff and great service. Chicken Istanbul is my favorite. I recommend everyone to try this place. You won't be disappointed. The owner also redesigned the inside of the store. It looks much better than before!"}
{"text":"Strong, easily customizable menu. Great portions, and very reasonably priced. One of my favorite places in town to stop in and actually get full. The chopped shish saute is my jam, but I like the chicken dishes too. Good neighborhood vibe."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Nice people. Clean atmosphere. I was surprised with the waffle desert that wasn't in the menu. Loved everything and definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Great food that tastes fresh and delicious. Counter service and delivery."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The only problem I would even say they have at Troy is that the inside is very boring and kinda awkward. Not a big deal though. Good food is good food."}
{"text":"Nice simple and great quality food. Ate a big burrito from here and and didn't feel like crap after lol which is a nice change lol"}
{"text":"They have excellent Mediterranean food.  I ate here a few months back with my sister because she wanted to try it out.  I had a falafel wrap with hummus and some rice pudding for dessert.  Everything was delicious...the falafel was some of the best I've had.  They are also super friendly and make you feel welcome as soon as you walk in the door.  It's a great little place to grab a quick and healthy meal."}
{"text":"So, I stumbled upon this place a few months ago while walking downtown in Kent looking for something different to eat. Needless to say, I've been back several times since.  I have only tried one thing called Chicken Instabul. Its chicken cooked in a red sauce and cheese. I get it in a bowl with brown rice, lettuce, corn and mozzarella cheese. This time I added feta cheese to it as well.  Its a nice small spot and its in a great location. You will have a little wait if its packed because all the food is made fresh when you order and I believe the owner is the only cook. But it's worth the wait.   I always carry my food to go but if I were to eat there, I believe they have music and a tv. The decor is nice and the menu is written in chalk which is pretty impressive.  I would definitely recommend this place ro everyone."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place back on 5/26/2016, but as I am eating some lamb from there right now (take-out), I just had to reiterate a bit.  First, excellent, fresh food prepared well.  Second, amazing array of items. The ordering may put some off (order at the counter), but just ask, and they'll guide you through it. Basically, you can get whatever you want in a wrap, a bowl, or on a salad. You pick.  And, lamb. Lamb done right. Lamb that you will want to eat slowly, savoring every bite, and thanking the gods that you walked into Troy and ordered the lamb.  True fact: every time I have ordered lamb when other people were standing at the counter, and the chef comes out with two skewers of that glistening glory, and slides it onto the bed of bulgar/etc., they say the same thing. \"What's that?\" (Lamb.) \"Wow, next time I'm getting that.\"  I mean, if it just looks that good...yes, here it really is that good.  'Nuff talking; more eating."}
{"text":"Don't let the sterile feeling interior keep you away, Troy is an excellent place to grab healthy, tasty, affordable bites to eat.   The food is a lot like a Mediterranean version of subway, you choose your dish and it's method of presentation (bowl wrap or salad) and then you choose your toppings. I've never had anything I did not like here, but I am now a huge fan of the chicken Istanbul which is flavorful chicken I have served in a bowl.  Lastly the family that owns this place is adorable. Whenever the wife is working the front she provides excellent service and the husband who is the chef is funny and nice. All around I am happy to support their small business and I hope more people give this place a try."}
{"text":"I've been coming this place for 2 years, still same quality, taste and friendly people.. Chef G is the best cook in town.. I like their new stuff all kind of FRESH FRUIT JUICE  and waffle"}
{"text":"AMAZING FALAFEL WRAPS!! My husband and I eat here at least once a week! Authentic delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  I usually get the Troy Chicken and hummus. Their food is very good and reasonably priced, for the portions you received. I get their bowl, but they also have wraps. Hope it catches on. Would go more but is often difficult it find parking downtown now, no matter what time of day."}
{"text":"Their chicken Istanbul is to die for! I think it has a pretty good atmosphere and with Turkish music playing.   They have daily deals on falafel wraps or chicken schwarma wraps depending on the day.   I highly recommend enjoying a Turkish coffee after your meal."}
{"text":"Troy Grille is a great addition to Kent, a town that already has its fair share of Mediterranean-inspired restaurants. A lot of other reviewers rave about the falafel - as they should. It's fantastic. I first wandered in here one year during Lent, looking for a satisfying meatless lunch option, and I was so happy I did. They make everything to order, so you know its fresh, and they have tons of options for toppings and sauces, so you can really customize your order to how you like it. The staff really encourage you to try new things, too - it seems like a family-owned place (yay local business!), and they really know the food, so you can trust their judgment.   Inside, everything is bright and clean, and they recently added a few tables outside on the sidewalk, so you can enjoy the sunshine while you eat.  Because they make everything to order, it can take a while to receive your order, especially if you go during a lunch rush. But, again, it's worth it. The flavors are great, the food is consistent, and the price is fair."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!! This is my favorite place to eat in town. It is tiny. Sometimes there is a language barrier. The food is amazing!!!! I've taken various friends here because it's so good. Friendly staff! Try it!!!"}
{"text":"Being part middle-eastern and growing up with this kind of food, this stuff is goooooood. I know a lot of people have come on here saying that the employees tend to be rude, but the times I've gone in the owner has been the one helping me, so I can't really vouch for the bad customer service. The owner is so sweet and my first time there I let him pick out what to put on my Kofte bowl and it was so delicious. The baklava is really good, the rice pudding could be a little bit better. The only reason I'm giving it a 4/5 stars though, is because they make the meat to order. So if you're in a hurry (and I mean a HURRY) then it's not going to be your best bet. Other than that great food, wonderful owner, and it should definitely be more popular than it is."}
{"text":"This place is delicious,  everything is freshly made. The chicken Istanbul is really good and I love their babaganush. It's like a mediterranean chipotle, completely customized.  I hope they stay in business for a long time."}
{"text":"Turkish coffee will turn you off to espressos indefinitely- Turkish coffee's bold rich flavor will not be beat!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been too in a long time. The moment I walked in the owner of the restaurant was very friendly, inviting, and patient. He educated me in what the foods were how they were made and what it was comprised of. So I was able to get food that was to my liking and tasted amazing! I will definitely be coming back here"}
{"text":"Owner is awesome! Always makes conversation when I come in. Some of the best Turkish food I've ever had! I strongly recommend the Chicken Istanbul, it is amazing. The baklava is also fantastic! Yet all of the desserts are awesome."}
{"text":"Troy Grille has some of the best food I've ever had in my life. The wait times are a little long, but the end product is amazing. The food is always fresh, marinated and flavored perfectly. The owners are some of the nicest people in Kent. In a town full of Mediterranean food, this is the best place to pick some up."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Mediterranean/Middle East food place in Kent. I go to Troy Grille at least once a week.  The restaurant is cozy and welcoming. I like to dine in and occasionally get carry-out. Service is pretty fast considering the fact that everything is made fresh from scratch! I have tried almost everything on the menu. My favorites are chicken istanbul, beef shawarma, and falafel. The ordering is similar to Chipotle. There is a nice variety of free toppings. There is also white rice and bulgur rice (it's like a grain cooked in tomato sauce and it's delicious!) Staff is always friendly and the chef greets each customer personally. His falafel is simply amazing! Chicken dishes are always cooked to perfection and retain the moisture really well. The chicken kabob and lamb kabob are cooked on skewers which I find kind of entertaining because the chef brings them out of the kitchen and places them in the bowl. The chicken shawarma is awesome for a wrap and the sauce in the beef shawarma is super tasty. I also like to get baklava and rice pudding (I switch between the two) for dessert. By far, the best authentic fast food place in Kent, in my opinion. The food is really healthy, so I don't feel guilty about eating out and not knowing what exactly goes in my dish. Whenever I take a colleague or friend with me to Troy Grille, they become regulars like me."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great prices, good food. Great for lunch on the go, and the best falafel in town. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Kent! The food in delicious and the owners and employees are so nice. This place is super clean so clean you could eat off the floor! I must say my mouth is watering just writing this review!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is okay for what its trying to be - Subway for Mediterranean food. Because of that its not the best sit-down restaurant, but service is fast and prices are cheap. Good for take out.  Tables & Chairs are really cheap and the dining area is small and not beautifully finished etc (echoes and boxy). Again, great for take out."}
{"text":"A little gem tucked into Main Street near the tattoo parlor and the used book store.  With just a few tables this place looks sparse and basic.    Some of the best chicken I've had here in the US or abroad.  Take your pick from a wrap, salad, or bowl.  The Chicken Istanbul mixed with mozzarella cheese and some kind of sweet red pepper sauce and is amazing!! The Chicken Troy wrap included another delicious chicken mix with grilled red peppers and onions inside a wrap with cracked wheat, lettuce and the complete fixins, and an little extra white bean salad.   Yummy!   Very casual, fast food.    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome local business filled with tasty (and inexpensive) mediterranean food. A nice Chipotle-style ordering system with tons of options for meat eaters, vegetarians and even those with gluten issues. A great deal, kind customer service and wonderful cuisine."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma bowl. It was delicious!!  And the hummus was excellent as well.  The chicken was cooked fresh - it wasn't sitting around in a heating tray so it took a few minutes to get our order but it was worth it. So be prepared for that when you order if you aren't walking in at the height of lunch time. I was in there at 2pm on a Saturday. I saw others ordering the chicken kebabs to go and once again - cooked fresh - and it looked fantastic. Do not let the sterile looking decor scare you away. From now on every time I am in Kent I am eating here!!!!"}
{"text":"The best mediterranean food around! Speed, service, portions, and pricing all blow the Continental out of the water. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I should have gone to Laziza, but was dressed too casually. Poor presentation, soupy hummus, chef continually yelled from kitchen to front desk co-workers, no table service, no one cleaning tables....will not recommend or eat here again."}
{"text":"The website indicates they have the best falafel in town and they did not disappoint. I ordered the Veggie Mix in a bowl for just under $9. It includes hummus, babagannus, tabouli, and 2 pieces of falafel. You can choose your toppings from a wide range of items (tomato, cucumber, red onion, lettuce, pickle, banana peppers, feta cheese, mozzarella, cheddar, olive, sauteed pepper and onion, tabouli, hot sauce, and cacik - cucumber sauce). It was a large amount of food and I was sure I would have about half left-over for the next day. Wrong, so good I ate the whole thing. Amazing falafel, babagannus and did I mention the falafel?  This will be a regular lunch-time location for me and my co-workers."}
{"text":"As a Turkish person living in the US, it's been hard to find Turkish food that would taste as good as the ones in Turkey. You know what they say about the Chinese food here? It's the same, the restaurants I've tried so far were completely different. And I was at the point where I was planning my vacation to Turkey for food, till I saw this place! Their food is amazing, I was there for every single day for the first week. Especially the homemade Baklava they offer is out of this world!"}
{"text":"I found everything here (taste, location, servers, ect.) just mediocre. Nothing to really complain about, but also nothing to really rave over. Even now, as I am trying to come up with a review, nothing is coming to mind. I had a falafel bowl, and was with friends who ordered the chicken Istanbul bowl. The friend was absolutely loving the chicken, but I did not try it since I don't eat chicken. As for the falafel, it was good but not memorable...  One thing I do specifically remember is that the sauces were extremely unimpressive. Especially the tzatziki-but-not (since they are Turkish based) sauce. So watery tasting."}
{"text":"Just walked out without even ordering. Waited for about 5 minutes without even being greeted as the employees talked in the back. One of them clearly made eye contact with me and continued talking without even attempting to greet or help me. I'll never go back. If I could rate no stars I would have."}
{"text":"Bomb-diggity. In a world of crap food on every corner, and quality food at such expensive prices, it's relieving to have a place that serves quality food at a good price. I've only had the falafel wraps but they are really good. The bulgar rice is a nice addition as well since this is a really healthy starch. I saw someone order a beef shawarma and it looked pretty good as well so I might venture outside of my usual falafel... but the falafel is just so good! Idk if I will. Give this place a try"}
{"text":"I love this awesome little spot! I honestly felt like I had been transported straight to Turkey as a friend and I ordered Hummus, Fresh Pita, and a  bowl of Beef Shawarma. The food is absolutely fantastic. They made our Shawarma fresh and drizzled on the perfect amount of olive oil onto the Hummus. The Pita was still warm as we ate it. The prices are decent and more than worth it for what you get."}
{"text":"Amusingly bad service. May have been off night but wow... Someone is either super high or just that clueless.   Food was good - solid. But for possibly the first time (for me) the service was awful enough to distract from the experience.  The chicken Istanbul was better than anything is ever had at Alladins, but I've never been a huge Alladiins fan.   Don't know if I'd give them another try - they just seem well-intentioned yet utterly clueless."}
{"text":"Terrific find!  Service was great, staff was friendly, the place was spotless, and the food was EXCELLENT!  I'll be a regular from now on."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, and we were lured by the Middle Eastern/vegan menu options. Wonderful falafel -- moist with a slightly crispy surface. Fresh, lightly grilled pita. The hummus is creamy/grainy with the flavor dominated by tahini -- just the way I like it. Our service today was delightfully friendly! The dining room is decidedly small and modestly appointed but spiffy clean. Overall, this place is a little gem for a casual, healthy, satisfying meal in beautiful, thriving downtown Kent."}
{"text":"Best falafel in Kent, hands down.  They clearly fry them fresh to order, as the preparation can take a minute, but the product is definitely worth the wait.  Crispy, savory, and definitely not from a grocery store mix.  If you are in a rush, call your order in ahead to make up for the extra prep time.      The owner (?) and staff member whom I interacted with were both extremely friendly, greeting me warmly when I first walked in.  The interior is cheerfully painted, and I like their signage directions for the women's bathroom, \"Women are always RIGHT\" :).  It's also nice that they sell packages of Turkish coffee, chocolates, and cookies, near the register.  They clearly take a lot of pride in their food and the heritage from which it extends.  I'm looking forward to repeated falafel stops here!"}
{"text":"Troy Grille is a place that you could easily overlook when you're in downtown Kent but you shouldn't. They serve exceptional, authentic Mediterranean food at a reasonable price. Depending on what you order it can take a while for them to make your meal because they cook everything fresh to order, but it's worth the wait.  I've been here twice and the guy who runs the joint is very friendly and accommodating. I told him that I like spicy food so he added some extra spices to give my lunch an extra kick to it.  The restaurant itself is kind of small, probably seats about 15-20 people.  Again, the only downside is that it could take up to 10 minutes for them to prepare your dish. So if you're in a rush you might want to go somewhere else. Otherwise, I recommend that you give this place a try."}
