{"text":"Tried this place because I got a groupon. It was clean and nicely decorated. Our server Jamie was very friendly and efficient. We ordered a beer each and they served them in icy cold glasses. Perfect start! Small but nice beer list! Good micro brews! My bf ordered the chicken tenders with fries and a side of Mac n cheese. His chicken tenders were the best I've tried. Crispy and excellent breading. The fries and Mac n cheese were awesome too. I had the pasta Alfredo with chicken and it was flavorful and a generous portion! I think this restaurant caters to a mostly African-American crowd...and we are white...but we didn't feel weird and they were friendly. I'd recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The Swerve Grille is a nice neighborhood grille/bar. They have excellent food and live music of Russell Thompson and Free Agent Band was superb! The only thing I would concur with other reviewers on is the service needs a LOT of work."}
{"text":"Omg, Omg, Omg. Will definitely be back. Everything I ordered was absolutely delicious.   CHICKEN N' WAFFLES: The waffle was perfect. It tasted like a damn funnel cake!!!!! It wasnt like the flimsy soft Belgian waffles Im used to getting. It was as if it were placed in a toaster. It came crisp on the outside and the edges, but soft and chewy on the inside. They put powdered sugar on top! The cinnamon sugar butter spread could be patented it was so good. That, with the syrup, made it almost orgasmic! The chicken was seasoned to perfection and was crisp and juicy... OMG, I cleaned those bones! Reminded me of my dad's wings, when I was a child.    THE FISH TACOS: Delicious! It was kind of Asian inspired, with soy sauce to hydrate it. The fish was crisp, yet juicy. Cooked correctly! The only downpart, is that they sent me a lime wedge, which looked like it had been exposed to the cold air of the refrigerator for two weeks. It was dry as a desert bone, and when I went to squeeze it over my tacos, not one drip came out. A major turn off for me.  TURKEY RIBS: Up there with beef ribs for me! Very tender and moist. Suprisingly meaty! The sauce should be bottled and sold in stores worldwide. Seasoned extremely well too! A new fav for me this summer. I will definitely be grilling these!  MAC: The MAC was fine. I'm spoiled by my own 6 cheese MAC. I like mine with rich sharp cheeses, like New York White Cheddar, Jalape√±o Pepper Jack, Parmesan, Asiago, Mozzarella, and Swiss, baked til' the cheese starts bubbling and the scent fills the entire house. Yum! But, it is fine if you like a more mild MAC. I fancy they made theirs with Colby Jack, and/or a very, very mild cheddar. It also tasted very buttery.    FRIES: Soooooooo..... good. Seasoned well! I got them for my turkey ribs. I smothered those babies in BBQ sauce as well.  ICE CREAM: Very rich thick vanilla, with the chocolate syrup. You could taste that it wasn't some cheap value ice cream,  which is why I suppose it cost $2 for one small scoop. It was good, until my son drizzled soy sauce on it.  Overall, the prices were exceptionally good, for such great delicious food. I spent $35 on dinner for myself and my son; a beer and coke included. Go on GROUPON like I did, and purchase a $40 coupon to Swerve for only $20. My goodness gracious! This food is ridiculously delicious. Totally killing ANY other soul food spot in Cleveland. Period. My first experience went extremely well. My waitress was amazing, and the music and atmosphere was nice. I was glad there were only four other parties there on a Tuesday around 7pm. It made for a more intimate experience. This time I will be coming back again with my hubbie next week on Tuesday, to get my fix of Swerve Grille. I may just be addicted..."}
{"text":"We tried Swerve because we purchased a Groupon.  Our server was very nice but our food didn't come out to us for 45 minutes. Out of 14 tables only three were being used. We kept asking when we would receive our salad and burger and keep being given the answer \"two more minutes\". Once our food did come out the burger was unimpressive."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Had the grilled shrimp on a grits cake with a jalapeno cream sauce...all of my group tried something different and it was all good! Drinks are also really good. I had a salted caramel mule. Live jazz very nice. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I had chicken and waffles with a side of Mac and cheese with greens. The service was great as well. The place is very small which is ok. The was enough space to have a dance floor to dance to the music the DJ was playing."}
{"text":"I've already had some poor experiences with swerve but this was worst. Went for drinks and food with a friend. Waited for tacos for an hour. Tacos. No one was there. No reason for tacos to be that long of a wait. This restaurant has no consistency. The food tastes different every time, either extremely over salted or under. Today, however, the customer service has never been so bad. I ordered 2 orders of tacos. So a total 2 hour wait. (Only ordered the second cause I had drinks and I wasn't in my right mind). By the time my food Finally came I was sober and pissed. I'm officially done."}
{"text":"My 1st time there everything was great the service and Entertainment was a experience to remember....will be back"}
{"text":"What I liked most about this restaurant was that they had a full menu and they have a DJ with a small stage for dancing! Very nice! The wait staff wasn't extra friendly, but definitely professional and wasn't rude at all.   I will say, $19 for chicken and waffles is laughable. So I ordered the southern fried chicken. It took 50 minutes to get my food, but when I did get it, it was nice and hot! (The place was full, and I only noticed two waiters, so maybe that's why it took so long to be served). The chicken was good, but not well seasoned. I really like the natural cut fries, and they were also fresh.   Nell had the shrimp Alfredo. The tail was still on the shrimp, and we alllll prefer them to be served with the tail off! But it was tasty and the garlic bread was also good. The portion sizes were good, not too large.   You have to sit next to your date if you want to have a conversation, because the music is not loud...not a complaint, but a FYI.   PLUS: a nice large, clean mirror to take photos awaits you downstairs! The bathroom is also clean!   You should definitely give it a go! The happy hour prices are good too! $5!"}
{"text":"We've been here for 20 minutes and already know we're never coming back.  We actually knew that 10 minutes ago when I tried to get the attention of the one server I saw and she cut me off while I was trying to say hi.  She then came back and argued with us about using our Groupon because we hadn't made a reservation, then said we couldn't use it for takeout even though it doesn't say that anywhere on there.  The table next to us is dirty and even though she's passed it at least three times since we got here and stood next to it while taking our order, but never tried to clear anything from the table at any point.  Sorry I can't comment on the food, but the service is absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied with the service and the food. The service was very very very slow and then the food was overcooked. Go figure. They will never get another dime of my money not worth it."}
{"text":"Fun bar, nice clientele and staff. Everyone was friendly even though I was from out of town. Drinks were serviceable, and well priced. They were open late on a Sunday evening which was awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here for date night and the food was great the service was horrible. I had the lobster pizza it was very fresh and tasted great. He had turkey ribs and they were delicious. We had to keep asking the wait staff for assistance, she brought us the wrong wine. She had an attitude the entire time like she was doing us a favor."}
{"text":"If you want poor service and over-priced food this is the spot if you like being surrounded by 20 somethings here you go I here the foods good but who pays  $18 for tilapia Ahh no I make more then the infants that come here I would not waste the money when the bar tenders act like they don't even see me!!"}
{"text":"Let's begin by saying the artists that perform are very talented & passionate about their work however I will never visit this establishment again. To make a long story short; after receiving cold food, drinks that took 23 minutes to get to our table what took the cake was when we went to pay for our meal.   My party sat patiently waiting for our credit cards to be returned to our table when the worst thing imaginable happened. In the rear of the restaurant there is a party of 8 or more guests that are passing around a green credit card, back and forth flipping the card over handing the card to the next person shaking their head. Finally the 5th man that looks at the card says loudly, \"who is Amber?\" I'm mortified, I have just witnessed 5 different people pass around my debit card! When the server arrives to my table I asked her if she had just allowed my card to be viewed by another party, she got an attitude, as if I had made the mistake. Absolutely inappropriate way to handle the situation. I spoke to the manager & as I explained what transpired he asked if I was drinking in the middle of our conversation. I said that's funny I've had one drink and it took 23 minutes to arrive. So no sir, let's not accuse a customer of being drunk! Educate & Reprimand your staff accordingly! Unprofessional staff, lackadaisical attitudes, horrible service, I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing...based on all the reviews I had high expectations for this place. I ordered the chicken and waffles with two sides (yams and mac and cheese). My chicken and waffles were ok, nothing spectacular in the least and my mac and cheese was horrible. I probably could've made it better out of a package. There was hardly any cheese, it was seasoned with just pepper and it looked nothing like all the pictures I've seen on here. The best thing I had was probably the yams. I ordered it from delivery through the uber eats app so maybe that had something to do with the quality, but I will not be ordering again at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My hat off to u guys my lady friend & I Really Enjoyed The Shrimp & Chicken W Veggies Alfredo Like Drake Used To Say The Best I Ever Had LOL & Im A Cook So U Kno Its Good LOL & The Shrimp Were Huge"}
{"text":"Food was great!!  Really good and speedy service.  Music was on point too. I've been wanting to try this place and so glad I finally did."}
{"text":"We had such a nice evening at swerve. The fried chicken was so amazing . Food, music, and service A+ The staff was very professional and efficient. I took my cousin Jesse there for his birthday and he will not stop talking about how great the fried chicken was. It really is the best fried chicken I've ever had in Cleveland . We are already planning our next visit. Thank you to the swerve family!!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting in swerve right now. I've been here for TWO HOURS for what I thought would be an in and out trip. I want to love swerve sooo bad but it's  jus a NO! Food was amazing when this place first opened Now it's far too inconsistent! I try the fried chicken & Mac n cheese every time but these days, the chicken is usually edible, no seasoning involved. The Mac n cheese is absolutely terrible now; no flavor at all. Today was my first time partaking in \"Taco Tuesday\". First order was pretty good.. 2 tacos for $5.. took a little over 30 minutes to get even on a VERY SLOW DAY! Placed an order to go, took AN HOUR to get TWO tacos! Drinks are usually good.. some bartenders are more heavy handed on the syrup than other. My drinks were extremely sweet, watched the younger bartender make drinks all night, heavy on the juice and syrup! At least two tables sent margarita pitchers back. One table said it was \"too thick\". Love them music. Please do better swerve. I bring so many customers and I want to love this place again! Shrimp tempura had good flavor but it was more so fried shrimp in a thick sauce than shrimp tempura ?"}
{"text":"I really am in love with the Chicken and Waffles.  I've had the shrimp and grits the past 5 times I've been at Swerve.  If you are free you should stop at Beats and Eats every FIRST SUNDAY for their Brunch/Day Party.  Live Music, Live Artist, Bottomless Mimosas and MORE!"}
{"text":"Great service, great drinks, the chicken and waffles were delicious and the rest of the food was quite good."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to find this place open on a Sunday night, (and not too far from our hotel.)  We only had drinks here, so can't speak to the food.   The bartender made good Manhattans, and the customers were friendly.  Seems like a great neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I go during happy hour when I can because it isn't as crowded and you can cozy up to the bar.  The music is always good and the drinks are on point.  The food is really good as well.  I recommend to go early if you are 35+ years old though :)"}
{"text":"I love coming here ! My wife and I always enjoy the ambiance and the service from Tiffany . The food an presentation is always 5 star!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and pass this place almost every day.  I've pointed it out to several friends and mentioned I wanted to go.  It definitely looks like a nice place, maybe even a little trendy.  When a friend came to town to visit over the holidays, I thought this would be a perfect time to stop in.  Unfortunately, our entire experience was not good.   When we entered, we were thoroughly patted down by security including a purse check.  No problem there, security is doing his job.  My friend asked the hostess if the kitchen was open and told it was.  We were hoping to grab something small and have a few drinks.  We sat at the table (the only people at that point sitting at a table) for more than 20 minutes without anyone coming to us.  We eventually figured out who the employees were and got someone's attention.  Because the volume of the music was not real conducive for talking, we decided to order food to go but ordered drinks while we waited.  When they came, they were in small plastic cups with a little bit of beverage.  We looked around trying to find anyone else with a little plastic cup and didn't see one.  Everyone else, whether in the dining area or at the bar, had rocks glasses, stemware, etc.  (Mind you, $18 for 2 beverages that combined could have been one.)  My friend asked about the cups and was told something about not wanting to wash dishes.  What?!  This is a bar.  When the food came, we paid and left but not without noticing that all the people that came in while we were seated walked right in.  One after another and not one person got patted down, no one's bag opened, nothing.   Sure, on any other day than Saturday it might be a good place to have a drink and talk.  Saturdays are loud.  Good music but loud.  I was hoping to find a good neighborhood spot but the way we were treated was clearly different than the rest of the patrons.  Maybe you have to be a regular before you get luxuries... like service, glassware, or a decent pour."}
{"text":"I forgot to take the \"Pretty before i dove into deliciousness pic\" so my pic is me 50% into OMG SOOO GOOD!   Used Uber Eats to order here because chain hotel restaurant food....me thinks not. Me thinks YAAAAAAS to Swerve! The Mac and cheese .... #JesusTakeTheWheelKindaGood! Like gimme your recipe Swerve because it's DELICIOUS!!! Fries that would usually suck unless hot and fresh out of the grease are still delicious!  Have not made it to the cheesecake yet....cellulite be damned ..... i don't care!!! So From now on when in town visiting corporate....Swerve via UberEats it is! The chicken and waffles.....y'all....I am from the Deep South and this dish would compete with the Deep South's BEST! LEGIT DELISH as a To-go. I can only imagine the epicurean ecstasy it is eaten in house!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to frequent for food and entertainment!! The only place in Cleveland who's Happy Hour is until 8pm. Friday nights are the best, thanks to the great live entertainment!! I tell everyone I know and those who visit Cleveland, to make sure they put this place on their to do list!!   Tonya"}
{"text":"A bittersweet occasion brought me to Swerve Grill, and while I hate saying goodbye to good friends, I'm so glad my girlfriend chose this place for her sendoff celebration.  The ambience is a sort of upscale-casual with low lighting, reds and black and white photos on the walls. There is seating along the main wall that runs the length of the space and long tables with seating for about 6 occupy the center of the room. Guests apparently seat themselves.   The food was SCRUMPTIOUS!! I had the chicken and waffles and the chicken was well seasoned, crispy outside and moist inside. The waffle was moist and flavorful, and indication that care is taken in making the batter. I also had the collard greens and green beans. SO GOOD!    Happy hour goes until 8 and there are $5 drinks and $5 foods on the happy hour menu. The shrimp tempura is mouth watering and several people at my table ordered a second helping to take home. Serving sizes are large, you will not leave Swerve hungry!   The only reason I have withheld the last star is because of the way they were working out server to death! For quite a while our server was the only server on the floor and so we had considerable wait times and he couldn't spend as much time visiting our table as he would have wanted to. He needed help! Our server was great, he did his best and was very polite, knowledgeable and friendly and I have no complaints about him or his service specifically, I just wish he had more overall support.   I am certainly looking forward to visiting Swerve again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I treated two friends of ours out to Swerve Grill last night, April 7, 2015. We arrived around 8:00, so it wasn't very late in the night. We ordered our food, and were waiting for the food when they began to set up for \"Comedy Night.\" There were no signs, no heads up from the waitress or staff that it was comedy night, and we had already placed our order and the food was in the process of being cooked. Unfortunately, it didn't take long before we knew this was not the type of environment for us. The language and vulgarity of the comedians was inappropriate for ANYONE who did not go there for that purpose. Had there been signs telling us that it was Comedy Night and adult language and subject matter was to be expected, we would have left before.  The comedians, one after another, frequently used the \"F\" word, the \"N\" word, and made sexually explicit jokes. One comedian even referenced having sex with a woman and a tampon was inside of her. Pardon me for sharing this, but this is what we were supposed to be listening to while we ate our dinner. We all were uncomfortable and terribly offended, so we wanted to leave, which we did. Since the food was already cooked, the waitress rang up our bill, included a 20% gratuity even though all she had done so far was bring us waters and take our orders, and we had to wait another 20 minutes or so before we took our food home, drove 20 minutes back to my house at at it there. I would have sent the dried up potato that I was given back had I been at the restaurant, and I actually had to warm up my food in the microwave due to the 20 minute ride home.   That was one of the most unprofessional experiences I have had in a very long time. Total Bill: $120.32 for a vulgar, profane, sexually explicit comedy act that we didn't ask for nor were we warned about, and cold food that we had to eat at my house 20 minutes after it was finished.   If I am driving on Chagrin Blvd, I would swerve into oncoming traffic before I would \"Swerve\" into their parking lot again. Unprofessional-ism at it's best; but the one bright side is they had cool menus. The menus illuminate when you open them."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  As several have mentioned, the music was very loud.  Come on this isn't a weekend night, the crowd u r likely to get on a weekend afternoon don't want to have deafeningly loud music blaring when trying to enjoy their food.  My 10 year old had to hold his ears, just ridiculous.  We decided like many others I noticed, to take our food to go. If the owner wants music like this he should just open a bar instead. I give this place six months tops."}
{"text":"First of all, in terms of the food itself, I'd give this place a 5 stars. The appetizer fish taco was absolutely delicious. The fish was cooked just right-- crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I usually don't like sweet dipping sauce, but this sauce went really well with the taco. Plus, it is half priced on Friday night, how awesome is that! My entree was jumbo shrimp, it's basically grilled shrimp on top of a grits cake. I loved the spicy kick of the shrimp!!-- that's probably my favorite of the night. I also tried the special of the day: chicken n waffle. I could tell that the waffle was made from scratch and it was baked to the perfection. Fried chicken was a little bit dry if I had to be picky, but the seasoning was tasty. One of the reason why I gave it a four stars instead of 5 was that the live jazz music was kinda loud, my friends and I could barely hear each other even though we were basically yelling. Don't get me wrong, the music was fine but just a little too loud. Another thing was that I waited 30 mins for my appetizer and another 40 mins for my entree. But I went to this place on a Friday night and it was literally a full house, some people had to wait by the bar. It could be because the groupon deal is on and actually the waitress told me almost everybody came in with the groupon.  Anyways, I like the food a lot but next time I would prbly pick a weekday to go there. And if u are still debating if u should buy the groupon or not, I hope my review could help u????(*^o^*)"}
{"text":"Horrible place to go. Food was expensive (but tasty). We went late around 10:30pm. Wasted an hour waiting for our bill (machines were down for an hour) fish taco appetizer only came with two tacos. Not worth the money. Ghetto"}
{"text":"Very nice, trendy venue. Second time here was on a Tuesday evening. Nice piped Jazz music, good service,  yummy food. Comfortable crowd. Had the chicken rolls, hamburger, fish tacos, Mac/cheese w pieces of lobster. All very tasty.  And it was Happy Hour!  First visit was on a Friday evening. The room was full!  The bar was hoppin'. Live Jazz music. Great service and food with nice presentation. Loud. Something different with good prices. Make a reservation. We'll be back for a third time."}
{"text":"People always encourages others to support businesses.  Well I definitely tried with The Swerve Grill.  My first Groupon experience was nice.  Today, not so nice.  I went out of my way tonight to pick up some dinner for my ill daughter.  I attempted to phone in my order person on phone was rude and said I couldn't use it on call in and I had to come in.  I did and was told It would not be honored.  I explained previous times I had no problem but she was adamant and I did not want to cause a scene.  So Swerve Grill with your loud music, rude personnel and indifferent owner, who by the way was sitting within three feet of me on the phone, never acknowledged the fact that his staff was being rude."}
{"text":"When I first heard the name of the restaurant, I refused to go.  But after scoring a great deal on a Groupon, I figured I wouldn't be losing much by checking it out.  I'm definitely glad I did, as their food is awesome and worth the buy.  I've been back about 4 times, with this review being my most recent visit.  Their BBQ Turkey Ribs appetizer is a must try!  A great alternative to those who don't eat pork products.  Tender ribs, with a decent barbecue sauce.  We also tried the Lobster Mac and I would get it again.  I will say that it's more creamy than cheesy.  There were no large chunks of lobster meat, which I think would really have set it off. But there was lobster in every bite.  My sister and I each ordered the Chicken and Waffle.  That dish comes with 3 wings, a waffle (butter and syrup) and 2 sides.  It's very generous, and filling, for the price.  I had collard greens and yams for my sides, my sister chose yams and asparagus.  The waffles were cooked well, if not a tad crisp.  The chicken wings are awesome and seasoned very well.  All the sides were good, with the candied yams being my favorite!  The food really is solid comfort food.  Where this restaurant lacks, on all my trips, is the service.  On this particular visit, we came on a Friday evening as the live band was packing up to go and they were switching to a DJ.  The place was pretty full but we only waited a few minutes for a table.  Then we proceeded to wait another 15 before we flagged down a passing waitress to hopefully take our order.  You can't always tell who works there. Some have on \"Swerve\" logo t-shirts.  Some have on all or mostly black, skimpy outfits.  We ordered drinks and food at the same time. 35 minutes went by with no cocktails and we had to get our server again to remind her about them.  She got them and our food followed shortly after. My Patron margarita was nothing too special. On each of my visits, the servers were kind, but didn't seem to be formally trained.    Is this a get dressed up, special occasion kind of place? To me, no. But can you get good food if you have patience? Definitely."}
