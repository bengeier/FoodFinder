{"text":"Amazing roast pork and even better prices all around. Very friendly staff. Good portion sizes too. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ka Ka Lucky is the place for awesome Chinese BBQ'd meats if you're ever in the East Chinatown neighborhood. This place is a total gem. I've only recently been going here because the BBQ restaurants in the Dundas/Spadina area just don't compare so I decided to venture a bit more east and found Ka Ka - oh lucky me. :D Lots of locals come here for dine in or order take out  of some some crispy salted swine, BBQ pork, BBQ chicken/duck or whatever other goodness they have swinging in their window. This restaurant serves up good quality BBQ'd meats at amazing prices."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from the restaurant and took some BBQ pork home from the front BBQ section. The former (had a noodle dish, scallops and veggies and a soup) were not great. The latter (the BBQ pork) was okay. So it's a draw - but overall, not sure I would go back. Was looking for authentic Chinese food and while there were many Asian people there, the food wasn't that impressive and the service from the restaurant area wasn't particularly friendly. The noodles (ho fun with black bean sauce and beef) were over cooked (granted maybe because I had to drive 10 minutes home) but they also lacked black bean taste!  It was just brown sauce with a few black beans thrown in for show, and more green peppers and onions than beef (like lots more). This is my test dish with most restaurant and I was not impressed.  I've had better and for cheaper. It's too bad - I had heard positive things about this place. On to the next place...."}
{"text":"BBQ for price, can't be beat... 'nuff said.

Says my review is too short.  Sometimes, it isn't necessary to say any more.  Kaka is a hole in the wall, I have been eating their food since I was but a wee lad.  My dad has been going there for over 30 years. Gross washroom, old and decaying floors and carpets, chopping board and the butcher's cleaver is probably older than me...

$5.00 flat lunch special BBQ pork with broccoli & tofu stir fry on white rice.  Da f*** you find that kinda deal downtown anymore?"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new spot out for lunch. Ordered the bbq pork and chicken with rice to go.
Unfortunately, what I thought was the crispy roasted bbq piece in my mouth... was half a staple. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Best roast/bbq pork in the city. Very reasonable prices. The service is always friendly and quick. The other menu items are perhaps not as good as some other places - but you simply cannot beat the value here. Great place, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Large portions for a good price and tastes great. Quick with orders for takeout."}
{"text":"It is a ridiculous place!!! DO NOT GO THERE!!!! The MOST important thing is please CHECK YOUR BILL before you pay. THEY ALWAYS ADD EXTRA DOLLAR TO YOUR BILL!!   The bill is  written by hand, normally customer won't check if the amount is right. 
Bad food, bad environment, horrible service, the floor is very dirty. The food is NOT worth for what you paid! it's discussing! Food is cold, and like they put it into the Microwave and warm it for 20 sec!

I will give 0 if yelp allows to!"}
{"text":"Great bbq meat at a great price. 2 or 3 bbq meats with rice and broccoli combo for $5-$6. Can't find that deal anywhere else."}
{"text":"Stopped in on an unplanned stop. They decor is classic western Chinese restaurants. Me and my partner shared 3 items and left full for under $30
 with the tip included.
She went to use the restroom's, and said it was impressive in it's cleanliness. 
Sorry for this lacking review, but she just called and I have to meet her to do groceries now.
I would recommend this place and hope to get back again some day."}
{"text":"Average food and average service.
The dish was cold.
They offer free soup which is ok.
Won' go back. I can get better one at home"}
{"text":"I come here often.
BBQ pork, soy chicken and duck on rice mostly, but have also had some deep fried shrimp appetizers and sir fried flat rice noodle w/beef, bean sprouts in soya sauce.

All the above are awesome and the prices are excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent take-out BBQ pork, cut right before you eyes. About $8/lb for the BBQ pork - very reasonable. Saved my bacon when I wasn't in the mood to toil over a hot stove!

They've also got duck, chicken ready for take-away too!

Highly recommended and easily accessible by streetcar along Broadview or Gerrard."}
{"text":"The review is purely based on their bbq items.  I used to live in this area and this is a spot I frequent for some declicious, cheap, sumptuous Chinese bbq take out.  Although I've tried their fried rice and noodles before, I think their strength still lies on their bbq items.  I especially enjoyed their free range chicken, and in my opinion they serve the best free range chicken in Toronto.  I've tried many other places uptown for free range chicken but nothing is as good.  Their other bbq items such as duck, pork and soy chicken are quite consistent as well.  The price here is also very reasonable.  For lunch box, one can always expect generous portion of meat, vegetable and rice for 6-7 bucks.  This is really what I call hearty Chinese bbq at its best.  The owner here is also very friendly and I always got free stuff during my visit."}
{"text":"Been there today! It is horrible! I would rather eat garbage rather come here again! First, soup is freezing to me! Second, o ordered 2 choices with duck and sausage! They only gave 4 tiny pieces dried duck bone! Third, even they gave me dried bones, I can still saw the hair!!! Dirty place and hated this place! Cannot be believe they can survive! I will report to CRA for any tax violation because it is cash basis! This kind of place even demands for tips! Tips is not obligation ok? It is a payment for their service? How could you pay for a non existent product?"}
{"text":"Guys, guys. I usually associate the east Chinatown with restaurants that are empty and a little rundown. However, this one definitely wasn't! Even the bathrooms were new and spotless. Renovations were good to this place!

Meanwhile, the food: the menu is a little unfriendly (no pictures, no descriptions, just lists upon lists in a tiny font) but after you get through that, the food comes to the table super fast. They definitely don't oversalt things; we ordered the crispy half-chicken, and it came with its own little bowl of salt and pepper. It was a little strange, but it's definitely good for people who like to have control over their salt intake. 

We also ordered the rice with chicken and vegetables-- this honestly didn't look appetizing, but it tasted like congee. 

The highlight was the chowmein noodles. The noodles weren't soaking in sauce, so they were still crunchy, which gave the dish great texture.

And at the end, there were free slices of watermelon. 

All in all, we ate a meal for four people and it cost $28.00. In tapas-crazed Toronto where \"sharing plates\" mean two dehydrated chicken wings for $18, I think this is a bargain worth having again. And again. And again.

Added bonus: it's close to Wong's if you want some great ice-cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"bland and bad.  veggies were overcooked, char sui was old and dry. seafood fried rice was super bland and very little seafood with chopped up pieces of shrimp, no scallops or veggies.  even the veggie chow mein was lacking in topping!
good price but crap food filler.  
save ur 5 bucks and go spend 2 more bucks around the corner at mei mei's for some fine vietnamese pho instead!

ka ka yucky is more like it bleh!"}
{"text":"Great place, even if Kelly O thinks it is fake.  Get a life, Kelly O.  

Always busy, which means lots of fresh food.  Their pork fried rice is probably one of my top 5 dishes in the city at the moment.  I bought a roast pig for my Christmas party, and everybody loved it.  What a deal!  

Full of characters as well, and great take-out.  People from all walks of life frequent this place, and I'm amazed at the amount of food they go through."}
{"text":"Fast, great service and prices! Food is also great. Parking on broadview is free after 6pm on weekdays which is a win!"}
{"text":"I always go there for their take out specials, I get the BBQ Pork on rice, and it's served with steamed broccoli which are delicious. It's an excellent deal for the size and for the quality of the food. The Pork is truly good, sweet and juicy with a nice crisp, and like I said the broccoli is most welcome. I haven't been interested in eating anything else there since the 1-item take out special is so good and convenient."}
{"text":"In today at 9:30 for breakfast.   The interior has a great modern Reno. 

1 type BBQ noodle soup (we choose BBQ pork) $5.99. So much BBQ and Chinese greens in wonderful broth and rice noodles. Huge portion 

2 pieces of braised tofu $1.50. U could get full on that alone. Excellent flavour. Huge portion again. 

Hot & sour soup.  Made to order. Shrimps/tofu/pork galore. Great balance of flavour. $3.99. 

One non greasy meat spring roll $1.50. 

Pot of tea & a coke. 

$16.36 (tax in). + $5 tip.  Staff are so nice 

We go once a week never disappointed."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars simply because I'm just not crazy about Chinese food. My first time here I came with my friend Jie and that makes any place good. He is sure to make you smile. Back to Ka ka lucky. Very popular well known spot, and very well known for its good authentic food at a good price. Very popular, seems everyone knows about it. The presentation and service are what you would expect at this type of place. Very good."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap, cheerful. The BBQ duck and roast suckling are a hong konger's delight. Steamed tilapia was fragrant with ginger and green onion slivers. Yang chow fried rice was delish but the meaty bits were just a tad dry. 50 bucks fed 7!"}
{"text":"I give this place five stars because I think they are the best at what they do.  What they do is Chinese BBQ.  I always get their BBQ  pork and roasted pork with rice and veggies for less than $7.  They have such high traffic that they constantly have fresh BBQ coming out."}
{"text":"Always a great stop for lunch, from the BarBQ to the Seafood it is fresh, well presented and tasty.
Service is fast and friendly.
I make this a regular lunch stop to relax"}
{"text":"Cheap chinese food! Good BBQ pork. Large portions. Service is average at best. Just come for the cheap lunch specials."}
{"text":"The bbq is decent compared to what else is in the area. However, I strongly suggest that you check you bill. the last three times I've been there I checked the total and it was off by 3-4 dollars each time. When I brought it to their attention they corrected the amount and made no apologies. The very last time I found a hair in my food, again no apology. I never went back since."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Went in the afternoon around 2.30pm. The place was not even busy. Maybe 7-8 customers. The waitress was lazy as hell... she looked half asleep, couldnt care less. Had to call out several times before I was even seated. Then took another 5 minutes to get me tea. For some reason she only cared about the customers in the back and not about new customers seated in the front. Then didnt see her for another 15 minutes before she gave a menu and looked asleep as she walked away. I made up mind what to eat and then didnt see her again. She was in the back of the restaurant like before. Finally I got fed up as no wait staff was around to get my order. Stood up, shook my head in animated fashion to let the boss know I wasnt pleased. Then walked out. Great way to lose customers!! Wait staff is the first impression of a restaurant. Obviously the place needs to re-train them or fire a few. Sucks!"}
{"text":"Well I guess it's been a while since I've updated my review here, but I'm glad to say the quality is still there.

This is still a classic, and I'm still a regular.  It's old fashion hole in the wall, but still great value.  As restaurants all around this place have come and gone in the neighbourhood, it's still here and still decently busy.

Not sure about this other review who doesn't like chinese food but still gave his nickle of advice.  Kinda like not liking burgers and reviewing a burger joint.  I don't get it.

Anyways... If you're looking for Chinese BBQ in the downtown core, this is still the place."}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Didn't have a menu so ordered broccoli beef veg fried rice, Chinese broccoli and the beef Ho fun since the photo on Yelp looked tasty. $35 for everything. 
Broccoli beef had a nice ginger kick to it. Chinese broccoli was crunchy and garlicky. Veg rice was tasty. Ho fun didn't look like the photo. Noodles were white not toasty or soya sauced like the photo. Tasted a little bland. Beef and greens were good. 
Of the four dishes the three were pretty good! We picked up a take out menu so we will have a better idea of our options next time."}
{"text":"Great spot specializing in Chinese BBQ Pork. Come for take out or dine in. If you are looking for a quick, tasty meal, this is a good choice. Compared to restaurants in Scarborough or Markham, not comparable, but for old China town it's alright. Good value. Service is quick."}
{"text":"It was okay. It doesn't compare to Chinatown or Congee Wong for food. At least at lunchtime. 

I came because of these rave reviews from Yelp, and craving cheap chinese food. I got my usual shredded pork and preserved egg congee ($4.50). it was okay, but not as flavourful. The dough fritters were crispy and oily just like how it would be on the street, which is good. 

My DPs got the BBQ choices on rice, with come bbq pork, roasted pork (yu guu) and duck on rice ($5-6). It was a big portion. The Yu Guu, was cold and more oily than it was crispy. We also got a side dish of deep fried squid that seemed to be deep fried maybe in the morning, and left to be cold. The squid was really tough and too difficult to eat. 

I would come back again, and try something else, maybe a noodles dish. Not that many places in the area except around here for cheap chinese food. So."}
{"text":"First of all, the service here was excellent! Better than you would expect at typical Chinese restaurants!

Overall food was good! Soup was delicious, fried rice of flavourful! The bean shoot wasn't the best, if you knew this vegetable they have to be picked at just the right time or else they become hard to chew, I just think they didn't get the best quality from their suppliers, so I had to spit some parts out because there was too much fibre making it hard to chew. 

Lastly, the bbq, we ordered a three item combo platter because we wanted to try different things. They were flavoured very nicely, the roasted pork had the perfect crunchy skin. However, how everything was COLD!!! Maybe it was because they hang all the meats by the window and it was a very cold day? But it definitely wasn't to appetizing to eat cold roasted meat since the fatty part got stale. 

Will return to try different things on the menu, and the service and food was worth the price. Maybe on a warmer day where the meat would get too cold."}
{"text":"Soo good loved the food ... And loved the chef walking by with a giant pig and pig head ... But the food was soo good got beef fried rice ribs general Tao and bbq pork and everyone enjoyed no complaints :D"}
{"text":"$70 for 3 people at this hole in the wall- prices are obviously a bit steep at this joint for what it is. The dishes really aren't very complex or difficult to recreate at home if you own a wok and have functional hands.
No diversity in flavor between the different dishes, almost everything was cold and tough to chew. Not inedible, but certainly mediocre. 
Gave the waitress a reasonable tip and she demanded more. That's what really turned me off to this place... I can take overpaying for average food, but I can't stand getting confronted over a 15% tip that I am not obligated to give in the first place.
They're obviously still going to survive, but I'm not going back. There's a million places to spend my money, and this ain't gonna be one."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing deep fried calamari and also a truly sensational pepper beef tenderloin. Combine them with the house fried rice and you're in for a 5 star culinary experience, at a great price!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cheap and cheerful Chinese restaurant in Gerrard Street Chinatown. 

I came here with my wife and ordered the 4-dish dinner combo for $22.99 (I believe).  We had stir-fried veggies, tofu hot pot, beef and broccoli and a mushroom dish.  All were done very well.  The best part is the choice.  There are tons of options for the 4-course dinner option and it comes with rice and soup.  There was enough food for 2-3 meals!!  We ate there and then packed away lunch for the work week. 

Service is efficient.  They are responsive to requests and aren't rude, but saying they are friendly would be an overstatement.  

The resto seems clean too, which is always nice!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place in Broadview Chinatown. Cheap and cheerful food and the portions are good. I tend to order BBQ items on rice. The soya chicken and duck are very good and you usually get a mix of nice meaty pieces and some bony pieces. Sometimes you get soup with your rice, sometimes you don't. 

The other items I've had from the kitchen (fried rice, noodle soups, fried noodles) have all been very tasty as well - not greasy at all. 

Great lunch for under $10, all in."}
{"text":"The best Chinese bbq in broadview+gerrard Chinatown and maybe the best in all of Toronto. I can't say how their other dishes are since I've never had but my family doesn't go anywhere else for bbq meat"}
{"text":"I'm a very pick person to begin with (also maybe I'm chinese as well) and this place blows me away. Usually I eat up in Markham/Scarborough but when you're downtown, it's different. Most of the things I've been ordering was fantastic. Nothing else needs to be change that's for sure. Went there already for the 2nd time and will be going back for more. If anyone loves Hot and Sour soup, this is the place. I do recommend to get it when it has been made the day before as it sits in better (of course). Nom Nom Nom"}
{"text":"this is probably the best joint in east chinatown. it is your typical hk/canto style bbq place, with friendly service in cantonese, mandarin, and english. 

the bbq is always very VERY fresh as they probably go through 4-5 pigs a day.  you can get a whole takeaway box full of rice, veg, and your choice of bbq (char siew, siew yuk, duck, chicken, squid etc) for about $5 and it will be more than enough to fill you up with leftovers. 

they have a great value menu for dinner, we once got 6 dishes for ~$45 and it fed 7. the seafood is always great. steamed fish is simply garnished to allow the delicious natural flavours of the fish to shine through. aside from the bbq, there are a lot of other great cantonese/hk offerings (chow mein, beef & broccoli, braised tofu & mushrooms, varieties of congee) as well as more home style stuff . (ie.fish fillets with sweet corn sauce!)

my boyfriend and i live around the corner and we probably reach ka ka 2-3xs a week. the staff recognize us and are always super friendly."}
{"text":"After bypassing the craziness on the Danforth - the street festival blocked the path to our Greek fix @ the Pantheon - we decided that it was late and we would just drop in somewhere closeby.

Arriving at the East Chinatown district I pulled out my trusty Yelp GPS and we shuttled into Ka Ka! My sister was stuck her nose up at the hanging bbq animals in the window display but we noticed the dining area past the takeout counter. It aint fancy but it certainly did the trick as far as our empty stomachs were concerned.

We ordered: (prices are estimates!!)

Mixed Seafood Congee ~$5
Stir Fried Chicken in Black Bean sauce $9
Black Pepper Beef flank $10
Beancurd Crabmeat broccoli and mushrooms $8
...obligatory Cantonese Chowmein $8

The congee came out piping hot and was thick with a flavorful rice-textured broth and a good amount of squid and fishcake. The main dishes came out within minutes and the service was quite good. They even brought out the hot plate with onions and poured the black pepper overtop which made a satisfying and sizzling spectacle.

There were only a couple things to improve here. The mushrooms in the beancurd were a little funky, and squirted a (fishy?) juice when bitten. The Cantonese chowmein was well balanced but I missed the crunchy textures of the usually birds-nest-like outer part b/c it was more or less the sauggy noodles throughout. 

Next time I'd definitely try out their delicious looking lobster and some of their specialty bbq meats (despite my sisters objections) :P"}
{"text":"Get the BBQ pork and soya chicken. They also have a decent hot and sour soup for those 'I'm dying from a hangover or flu/cold days'. Seafood is great too here, since the fish shop is next door."}
{"text":"So I've been wanting to attempt making my own char siew bao, but not wanting to go through the whole proposition of making the char siew myself. Which brings me to wanting some really good char siew, and I found it at Ka Ka Lucky! For five bucks I got a HUGE box of pork, rice and broccoli. The pork was salty, sticky, fatty, but not to much and unctuous. Really solid umami, exactly what I was looking for. Crispy fatty bits, fat to meat ratio was awesome and I definitely know where to go for that char siew. I'll be attempting those buns soon and see what I come up with. If you're in the Riverdale neighborhood, live around here or just want some great BBQ pork chinese style, check this proverbial hole in wall out, it's worth it for the BBQ pork!"}
{"text":"Legit BBQ pork and roast pork. I grew up in Hong Kong and this bring me back. 

Do it. Nice staff too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Very homey and the owners give great service.

Every meal includes a delicious homemade soup that can serve a whole group of people. For just $4.50, you can get a large bowl of noodle soup with your own choice of noodles, and bbq item. You can even watch them bring the soup to the bbq area and watch them cut the meat fresh into the bowl!
Even as an added bonus, they give you some fresh melon to finish your meal nicely.

Great service, the folks are friendly, great prices and good food."}
{"text":"They are NOT closed as in permanently... they are undergoing renovations. There is a handwritten sign on their window with and email address, \"kakalucky349@gmail.com\", if you want their updates. I passed by each week and from week to week, new drywall, new floors, paint... slowly but surely they are renovating. Hopefully they will open soon as they've been closed for almost three months now. 

Foodwise, they are in par with what one would expect from a Chinese restaurant. There are a few dishes they seem to do very well, in some places, and very typical in others. The funny thing is their printed menu isn't their actual menu. It's just a standard Chinese/English menu for non Chinese speaking people and in NO way reflects their actual quality or skill. 

Being Chinese, I am able to order without consulting any menu. I simply tell them what I want and the style I'd like it done and it comes out perfectly every time. What I am most impressed with is their speed. For kitchen orders, we have to go to the back of the restaurant by the kitchen if we're paying with a credit card or debit. The time it took to place the four dish order, pay for it, then walk to the front of the restaurant to sit and wait. I didn't even get a chance to sit down and I was called back because my order was ready. That was impressive. 

In another person's review, they claimed they ordered a dish by the pictures? NO Chinese person does that. They gave the order by name of the dish and from that they weren't amused by what came out. But unless they ordered it correctly and in the style they wanted, all they would get is the basic English version. So it was their fault they didn't get it the way they wanted without specifying. 

You can order off the menu and specify to make it spicier, or more sauce, or dry fried... or other variations."}
{"text":"I dream of the lemon chicken, eggplant with spicy pork, fried tofu and garlic choy sum. The kids worship the BBQ pork noodle soup and Yang Chow fried rice."}
{"text":"$6 for a delicious pork dish with perfectly steamed broccoli an absolutely delicious sauce on well steamed rice. Crispy, savory and delicious. Very generous proportion. $6 incl. tax. Like woah!"}
{"text":"Good food, plenty of veggie options, friendly staff. I ordered the garlic green beans, ginger eggplant, and hot and sour soup and all were quite good. Will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I found this place on a list of Toronto's best meals under $10.00, and thought I would try it out. So, I ventured all the way from the North-East end to Ka Ka Lucky hoping to find a decent   affordable meal. To my discontent, I entered Ka Ka Lucky and found it to be a cheap Chinese restaurant. I figured that appearances weren't everything, especially in Asian cuisine, and looked forward to the menu. 

There was an array of different rice and noodle dishes, all of which were priced around the $10 mark. I had a certain BBQ pork dish on rice with vegetables. The rice was what you would expect. Typical sticky rice with a watered down hoisin concoction to give it some flavour. The \"vegetables\" was just 3 measly florettes of broccoli, presumably with the same flavourless sauce. Last and probably the least was the \"BBQ\" pork. This meat seemed to be no more than cold breaded pork chop. Admittedly, the crunch from the outer coating was nice, but the temperature and cold fat really threw me off. Palatable, but not preferable.

Being a student under financial constraints, I do not typically tip, especially at establishments that offer very limited service (such as Ka Ka Lucky). For this reason, I was appalled when the waitress who had not even served me, pressured me for a tip - after having payed my bill, might I add - about 4 times. When I explained to her that being a student, I simply could not afford additional expenses on top of my bill, she gave me a disdainful look and walked away.

Overall, I am immensely disappointed with Ka Ka Lucky. I usually give such places the benefit of the doubt when judging price and ambiance and keep an open mind, but this was a true let down. For $10, I will find far better meals elsewhere."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was called something else a few years ago.

Popped in and it has changed. 

Management spent money on decorations and it looks clean. No grease smell in the air. Vents actually work. 

Waiter and service was great. That's bonus in a Chinese restaurant. 

If you love Chinese style barbecue pork, duck, soya sauce chicken, this is the place to go. 

Window has all the barbecue meats hanging on racks. If this doesn't gross you out, then this is the place for you.

Barbecue food is great. Some of best I had outside of Hong Kong. 

Price is cheap! Large plate with two meats cost $7.99 and you get tea be a bowl of refreshing soup broth. Small is $5.99. Can't beat the price! 

I ordered the barbecue park and soya sauce chicken on a plate of rice. Also comes with some tasty broccoli.

Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty cheaply priced and very tasty!  Service is pretty good as well and they also offer free soup which is always nice!  I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"The best BBQ meat in Chinatown!! Much better than places on Spadina. Also the cheapest around and it is friggin delicious. Not abnormal to see lines of ppl out the door here after work. The servers know english, service isnt out of this world but better than most asian restaurants where the focus is on efficiency. This place is Yum! I would def recc this place for anyone in the neighborhood. It may look like a hole in the wall, but the BBQ meat is tasty"}
