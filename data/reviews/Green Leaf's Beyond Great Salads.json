{"text":"Drug test your employees. They are all incompetent other than the one guy making salad."}
{"text":"Excellent spinach salad with my choice of toppings! A great clean eating option at the mall. Staff was courteous and friendly. Great concept! Now I want one of these in Wilmington!"}
{"text":"I always like to stay somewhat up to date on the latest trends. This place almost reminds me of a cheaper Chopt (a salad company). When I saw this place in Concord I wanted something healthy, surprisingly this was about the only place. The service was horrible. I had the grilled cheese and  Cream of Broccoli soup. My soup was cold and the grilled cheese was ok. Wasn't the best I've had, but besides that the food was decent. I tried some of my friends soup; she had the tomato soup and it was fairly hot."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The staff is the rudest I've EVER seen.   A bunch of kids with an attitude. They move slow and talk to each other instead of the customers. Not only will I not be back, I'm going to make a formal complaint."}
{"text":"Such horrible customer service.  The workers there gave such attitude and finally after messing my sandwhich twice, I asked for my money back."}
{"text":"I ordered the Asian Chicken Wrap.   It was tasty.     The girls working there are extremely rude!!       Several people in line were talking about their attitudes."}
{"text":"The Girl taking my order was less than friendly, would ask questions in a soft voice and I had to ask her to repeat herself several time, she would say it again in the same soft voice and roll her eyes. RUDE! I ordered a southwest chicken panini, the bread was warm and the cheese and meat were cold.  The sandwich was $7.89 but not worth more than $5.00.  Overall I was not impressed, I will pick a different restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Worst place I've ever been to in a mall food court. I went to the smoothie place connected to this place and the staff was beyond rude and unprofessional. Like another person said, a bunch of kids working there but barely working. They were just running around joking with each other. If I thought they could perform the brain power to get give me a refund I would have asked for that. Instead I took the smoothie it took them 15 minutes to make, I stood there and actually timed them, and left. The smoothie was overly sugary and poorly made as well. Needless to say I ended up throwing it away. I recommend everyone stay away from this smoothie/salad place."}
{"text":"Upon arriving to the front of the counter there was literally no one in front or in back of me. I requested for my wrap to be made a certain way and the young lady preparing my food. Openly expressed her discontent because I was ordering my wrap specially made because as she stated she \"already had wraps made up\" after her comment she decided to try and convince me to take the already made wrap because my \"special request\" was going to cost 1.00$ extra. She prepared two other peoples order that were online after myself   My wrap was drenched in dressing  I had carrots on one side cucumbers on another the bottom of the whole wrap fell apart due to all the dressing.     I would recommend they hire people with better customer service skills. I didn't get a thanks a hello no even a come again no nothing they actually made me feel like I was a bother. After my encounter with the 3 females working there I would not go back I would never recommend this place to anyone"}
