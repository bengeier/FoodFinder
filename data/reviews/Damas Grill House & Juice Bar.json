{"text":"This place is a surprise gem considering I was looking forward to trying out 'Steak Queen' back then when it existed. BYE BYE BYE!!! I decided to give this place a try, eventhough, I usually don't eat Mid Eastern food.   The interior place is good. The woods that they have (tables/chairs) are real solid quality and I wished I owned one of those sets. They have a wide variety of selections: Burgers, Shawarma, Rice dish with kabobs, and many more items that I'm sure to try one day. And they have a juice bar there which is a plus! (Love Juicing the Right Way)  I think their deals are pretty fair, and I decided to order a few things. I got the Shrimp shawarma, Chicken shawarma, Beef shawarma, Beef Kabob dinner that is served with rice, salad (little lettuce and more tomato and cucumber), on the side with hummus and garlic butter sauce. This is a nice healthy meal that is a deal for $12. (Not including the shawarma's). I got the fresh watermelon juice and although it took 5 mins to get ready, but I can see the lady juicing and not stringent on the pieces. The taste is def good and worth the $3.5!   The shawarma all of course comes with your choice of toppings which I can see they stick by their healthy choices like: lettuce, tomato, onions, turnip (purple colour), parsley, cucumber/tomato mix, tahini sauce, hot sauce, garlic butter, hummus, some hot jalapeno chopped up. All these with your shawarma is CRACKING GOOD!  The Beef Kabob dinner I had was great and I would eat it again, but I want to try more other stuff so I get more of the cultural taste.  Here are my scores for this place: Food: 4/5 Choices: 5/5 Interior: 3.5/5  This is one of my few Mediterranean visits that I go when I have the chance and expect fresh, quality service!"}
{"text":"I came here around 9:30pm just before closing on Sunday night and food portions here was large but a bit pricey for Mediterranean food. However, like many others have said before me, the chicken shawarmas and the kabob plates are great to eat. I don't know if it is because I got there around closing time or whether it is like this normally but the restaurant was pretty chilly inside as if the heat was turned off. I was alright eating with my jacket on the back of the chair but I saw some others around at different tables eating with their winter jackets on. Maybe the restaurant will be warmer next time if I visit at normal dinner hours and I will be able to try out a drink too. As for the atmosphere itself, this restaurant feels almost like a dressed up cafeteria or fast food joint that isn't quite as fast. You have to go up to the cashier to order, wait to pick up your food and take it to a table yourself because it has no waiter service.  Update: I've come here about 4 times now and on all visits, the wait in line is just as long. People working there also seem to not serve food in the order that it was purchased. It's baffling how someone who also ordered food that required cooking the meat on skewers 5 minutes after me will get their food first while I will still have to wait another 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Best restaurant ever everything is amazing you will not be disappointed. Always buy the chicken shawarma plate my fav."}
{"text":"I live about 2 minutes away from the place. Been driving pass it for the past 6 years. Tried it out for the first time today. The food was good, the portion was great. Service was a bit slow but decent. The decor in the restaurant is a bit odd. It almost feels like a bar, the seats are all wood so not very comfortable. They have glass table covers, so I was nervous because I am afraid that I might accidentally break it.  I tried their coffee today as well. It taste very good. (Black, not very bitter, very good)"}
{"text":"Service is always friendly, and the food is yummy. I always get the falafel dinner plate with rice and tabouli. You can even ask them to add more lemon to your tabouli, if you like it more acidic. The garlic sauce and hummus are flavorful and never disappointing.  The juice bar is kind of strange, because I never see anyone using it, or any of the staff working there, but it's a quirky kind of place."}
{"text":"Its always fresh and tasty! But after having been here few times this year I notice the service is really slow even for a shawarma. The wait is definetly worth the food you are getting since (again) its fresh and tasty, but don't expect to do a walk in walk out type thing for a shawarma. I recommend their chicken and beef platters. The d√©cor is decent and prices are average. I think its the only decent middle eastern restaurant in Toronto (isn't that shocking)."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time and I tried their shawarma meat which was so so good I never have had shawarma that tasty in my life so thumbs up. And the service is very quick and friendly ."}
{"text":"Went in based on the reviews, however it was a terrible experience.   I ordered the SHOOAF WRAP, upon making the wrap I realized that it didn't look like what it advertised in the picture, so I pointed that out to the guy that was making my wrap.   In the advertised image it shows that the wrap is made with fries, upon asking for fries the response was very rude, as if I had asked about something incorrectly. The guy behind the counter proceeded to say that \"fries are extra\" , if I wanted fries in it, that I was to have requested it when making my order. He then proceeded to talk to the other people behind the counter in his language, which was obvious that he was annoyed with my request in regards to the situation, very unprofessional.  After discussing for some time they decided to put the fries in the wrap, but were frankly not generous with the portion, (3 fries in the whole wrap) smh.  Regardless of the experience, the food was decent. It corresponds to the price point they hold.  Lesson learned, not to have expectations when entering a joint as such."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in this place, I had a feeling that the food was going to be delicious.  I wasn't disappointed at all.  It's your typical Middle Eastern place with a twist.  A twist of seafood and foods from other nearby Mediterranean countries.  Nevertheless all items -- except their shawarmas and fried stuff -- are fresh off the grill.  This is what makes this place an awesome eatery.  The menu is big and diverse, filled with traditional dishes and combos.  Its a range of food such as: shawarma, kebabs, fish, lamb chops and more.  The mains are served on their own or part of a combo.  There's also a fresh juice bar - which I haven't tried.  Overall, the place is well worth a visit.  If you like Middle Eastern cuisine, this will definitely be one of those place you will like to frequently visit.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a few years now and the chicken shwarma dinner is my go-to take out meal! They pack the take out container to the max! Lots of chicken and their rice is full of flavour! Very generous portion; two meals for me!  Never dined in and could possibly serve u more food. The interior decor is definitely very interesting but it's all about the food for me!"}
{"text":"Great Food. Cozy place. Friendly staff. Nothing not to like."}
{"text":"This place has changed hands so many times, I was very nervous about the prospect of eating here, but ended up getting taken by a coworker who really likes the food.  I got the chicken shawarma dinner.  It was okay - not bad, but not exception either.  The salad was kind of disappointing - you can get caesar or italian dressing, which weird to me, frankly.  It's not a bad place to drop by for a quick lunch.  It's cafeteria style dining, which I actually prefer, but the space is sort of weirdly laid out.  The sitting area has a nice feel to it, but the cooking/food area REALLY gives off a cafeteria vibe.  Overall not bad, but not great.  Editing: came back. Deeply unimpressed the second time around. They messed up my order with someone else's and then pressured me to take it. Not thrilled."}
{"text":"Typical falafel/shawarma joint but in an old burger building. Spacious but aged. Falafel was good."}
{"text":"Super tasty grilled food, salads are fresh and juices are also fresh and tasty. Not your typical fast food shawerma place, many levels above that."}
{"text":"There is a line up for a reason. I've been going here since they opened and the food/service is pretty consistent. Try the Lentil Soup."}
{"text":"Great service. Good portions and really delicious kebabs and shawarma!! I really recommend this place. It's clean and food prep is very organized."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! The food here is definitely mouthwatering. I've been over a dozen times and it's always been good! The service sometimes is slow because it's run by 3-4 guys (maybe family?) and when it gets busy, it can get hectic! I've come here at 10pm (when it's supposed to close) and they served me (YAY!). My most recent visit.. they ran out of shawarma (although it was around 8:30pm) so I got skewers and they gave me chicken and lamb instead of chicken and beef (not that I minded - I love both combos). You get a big portion for around $11~.. so that's a plus.  The decor is eclectic - wooden furniture and a wooden hand-wash station (kinda cool!).   Anyway, the food is great, sometimes the service isn't but that shouldn't deter you from coming here!"}
{"text":"Lebanese food. Cool log furniture. Ample parking and easily accessible from either Victoria Park or Lawrence making this my favourite Middle Eastern restaurant. The staff are competent and take pride in both their restaurant and their barbequed offerings along with the refreshing selection of fresh juices. Even though the funky log cabin look and wood everything seems out of place for a restaurant from a land where trees are not in abundance, the wood adds character and feel. There is even a sink right out in the open near the lineup for orders, possibly to expedite your lunch experience by saving a trip to the washroom. The grill is the thing here and everything looks and tastes similar yet is all mouth-wateringly delicious. There is a glass display case showcasing the skewers of marinated goodness before they hit the grill. The view from this classic Scarboro location hasn't changed much in decades and I'm glad for that as the vista is an open and pleasant experience looking west over the glorious Don Valley and calms the soul as well as the Damas food and splendid fresh juices do. Highly recommended on your next trip to Scarboro!"}
{"text":"very tasty shawarma plate. portions could be a little bigger but otherwise food is good. would come back here again"}
{"text":"As a group, we tried the Chicken Shawarma Sandwich (2 for 8.99), Falafel and Salad. It was pretty decent overall - not the BEST I've ever had - but it was good.  The fries are super crispy. You can choose your fillings, and how much of it you want.  The radishes didn't look exceptionally fresh, but that's my favourite part of the shawarma. Service was fast enough.  There was issue over the garlic sauce for dipping the fries- i mean if i'm eating fries at a middle eastern place would I choose ketchup - heck no - Garlic sauce all the way. they charge extra for a measly ketchup cup portion   Big spacious place with wooden details on furniture.  It's just a little awkward to get to,  making a bunch of lefts, and a steep slope and all."}
{"text":"Damas is my favourite Shawarma/ middle eastern place (BTW, they are Syrian, not Lebanese). Their beef shawarmas are delicious (get extra garlic sauce it's yummy), love the pickled turnips. The only thing I'm not fond of is the salad - like most middle eastern salads, it's heavy on the cucumber and mint. Their french fries are excellent, among the best I've had."}
{"text":"I've had good food in the past but today it was really bad. The Greek salad dressing tastes like only vinegar and the shawarma chicken tastes like the skin guys and all.  I asked them to fix it and he refused. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Yummy Syrian food! Tried the Chicken Shawarma and it was very good.. going back to try more things soon!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Went after hearing reviews. Bland kebab, portions were okay, okay ambience. I may only grab a shawarma for a quick bite which is affordable but nothing special. Not excited about any other items on the menu. May have been a good place before but not to me. Not recommended."}
{"text":"This place is a dive, but a yummy one.  The former Steak Queen was an institution here in east Scarberia, but I'm so glad this mish-mash of middle-eastern/greek place is here.  I had the traditional mixed shawarma sandwich (beef/chicken) with a side of fries, and it's as yummy as any other place, with all the fixin's.    My friends got a a falafel plate and a chicken shawarma plate, that had perfectly cooked rice and amazing greek and tabouli salad.  I got to take a bite of everything, and its seriously as good or better than many Mediterranean fine dinning experiences I've ever had.  Super garlic-ky and all full of flavour.  The only reason it loses a star for me is that this is the second time i've come across some painfully slow service because people in front of us had massive orders.  They were a little panicky in the back and were very confused, but did manage to hammer out the right foods to the right people, but for \"fast food\" it probably took 20 minutes from getting into line and picking up our food.  They should at least tell people to sit and call out their orders.  Other than that.. there's no better value in the GTA!"}
{"text":"We went for takeout but ended up eating in.  The staff convinced us pretty easily!  Delicious, fresh and beautiful food.  It is my new favorite and trust me...I have had falafel everywhere and here it was tasty, crispy, and hot!  Thank you all for a surprising fab dinner."}
{"text":"Prices have increased by quite a bit. Portion size is good but the quality is sub par. Burger Patties are so small. Food didn't taste that fresh. Overall I probably wouldn't come back. This was my fourth time there."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE, BAD SERVICES AND UNCOOK FOOD...... Yesterday, my friends and I decided to check out this Damas grill house (because it has good rating on Urbanspoon). What a mistake this is... the owner is rude when I orders my food. I asked him politely can I have a mixed of chicken and beef sharwarma (one of each), He told me rudely NO (this is his exact word: \"what, you want to PAY for the price of the beef?\") because there is a price difference of $ $ 1.00. And being a first time customer, I didn't know the prices.. I told him is fine I gladly pay for the extra dollar. And then he refuses so I ordered 2 Sujuk sharwarmas. My friends order the chicken kebobs dinner. And half of our food is uncook. I had sujuk sausages lots of time at other restaurants and I know if it's not cook. But the sausages is still raw inside. And 2 of my friends chicken still a a bit pink inside. We don't want to complaint because there is a long line up and the owner is rude. Let just say we ended up throwing half of our food out. And the washroom trips for some of us is painful the next day. I know is hard to confront them after because we already ate it and threw our food out. Is our words against them :("}
{"text":"Damas Grill House & Juice Bar is a rare find and am I ever so glad that my sister accidentally stumbled onto this place.  Having lived abroad in Asia for quite a while, there are certain foods that you come to miss and Middle Eastern is definitely one of them! Sometimes, you even dream about it, and when the opportunity comes for you to actually be able to eat it, you are let down because you've built it up so much in your mind. Not the case here.   Last year, I was craving Chicken Shawarma and my sister brought me here. The chicken was tender and moist, we replaced the rice with fries which were crispy. The salad, garlic sauce and hummus complete the meal. The portions are very generous. We had leftovers, which we then packed and had for lunch the next day.   The first thing I said when I moved back to Toronto recently was, let's eat at Damas!  This time we also ordered watermelon juice which was really fresh and didn't cost an arm and a leg. The menu is also quite extensive. My cousin and her husband who don't eat meat, but are ok with fish ordered the Tilapia wrap and Tilapia meal. They enjoyed the fish and said it was great, but being a \"safe\" eater, I like to stick with what I like and that's the Chicken Shawarma. Maybe one day when I get bored with that, I'll try something else on their menu, but I don't see that happening anytime soon.  With wooden tables and chairs, the decor of the restaurant is quite casual. It's a fast food style restaurant where you order at the cashier and wait for your food. So, if you're looking for a fancy place to dine at, this is not it, but if it's great Middle Eastern food that you're looking for, then look no further, you've found it!"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with some of the other posters, this is definitely a gem in Scarborough. Years back it use to be a Scarborough institution Steak Queen but after Steak Queen closed down, it was empty for quite a few years.  I have quite the fondness for Middle East food, so I decided to try out this establishment. I order the Shisk Tawook dinner ($9.49) which is a chicken shish kebabs with your choice of rice or fries and a salad. The chicken kebabs are nicely seasoned, juicy and cooked over a grill. I have tried both the fries and rice, the rice is nice and moist while the fries are very good and not too salty. The salad is fresh and and includes a lot of vegetables that are nicely diced. The meal comes with a pita bread. I also ordered an avocado smoothie from their juice bar for $3.99 which was also quite good and freshly made.  One thing is you will notice is that the portions are quite large and the place can get quite busy, so be prepared to wait 10-15 for your food. At the same time, the people that work their are very friendly and more than accommodating."}
{"text":"As Steak Queen's days has ended, Damas Halal Grill House arises to take advantage of the corner location.  A location that sees plenty of TTC riders pass by as well as Van Drivers stop by for a quick take-away before continuing their work-day.  Outside Logo shows Mediterranean but as I walk within, figuring out to walk towards the rightside next to the washroom area, I noticed majority of the Food Menu is Middle Eastern/Lebanese oriented.  Falafals, Shawarmas, Kababs, Soujuk, Chops, Tahini Salad, Tabouleh, Baba Ghanouj, Fattoush, Hummus, Lebneh, Foul, etc...  Secondary was Express Thai Food(Viet Noodle, Thai Sour Soup, Red Curry Beef, Chinese Dumpling, Beef or Chicken Thai Sandwiches).  I'm not quite sure if this is the place most people would ask for such cultural fare.  At least not while I was dining in the quite interestingly styled interior decor.  Everything had a WOOD theme from the Tables, Chairs, Jacket Hanger to the Garbage Bin.  2 LCD meant I could either watch CP24 Steven Harper Federal Election or CNN Barack Obama Libyan Address.  There are also elements of Greek Food and miscellaneous Burgers/Sandwiches, Fries, Sides.  Milkshakes/Fruit Cocktails, Smoothies, Juices, Teas and Coffees.  2.5'd  Tahini Salad Shawarma($7.99)  -  Reasonably priced comes with sauces(Tahini, Green Chili, Remoulade(?)) as the Tahini Salad was made fresh from the Salad Bar slash Shawarma Toppings station.  The Chicken Shawarma was the less appealing of the entire plate as it was overcooked in my situation.  It came with a Pita Wrap as well so in essense it was a Decomposed Chicken Shawarma.  Fresh Lemonade with Mint($2.99) helped clear my palate from bite to bite as you take your own tray of items to your selected table which means leaving Tips optional(at the register)."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a whim as I've have passed it countless times before. I tried the falafel wrap which was honestly really delicious. I'm really picky with falafels and typically don't like them but because I was hungry and I'm a vegetarian there was really nothing else for me to try. Regardless, glad I tried it because it had the right amount of spice without overdoing it. I also loved how it  was perfectly and tightly wrapped making it easy to eat on the go.   As for service, I was in and out within less than 10 minutes so speed is always a plus in my books. Other than that there was really no interaction besides that of making my food.   I'll come back again the future when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Before I get into my review: my main complaint is the excessive price hikes. What we used to get for $5.99 is now $8.49+. Full dinners were $10.49, now they're $15. It hasn't even been 2 years. Every few months, more and more price increases, so I flat-out stopped going!!  (especially because nearby, between VP and Warden, there are nearly a dozen other shawarma places, most considerably cheaper)  Anyway, on to my review: I used to go here a few times back when it was \"Steak Queen\", but Damas is better. Here's the skinny...  ENTREES / SIDES: It's always very fresh and tasty. Whether you go with the shawarma (available in beef or chicken), the Shooaf (steak shish kebab) or Shish Tawook (chicken shish kebab), you're getting a winner either way.  Those two seasoned shish kebab items are placed uncooked over an open rotisserie, allowing the meat to be cooked evenly without grill marks burning away the seasoning. It comes out perfectly juicy every time.  If you do decide to get the shawarma, it's great. I personally prefer the beef over their chicken, but some say the opposite. If I have one complaint, its that they constantly run out of the beef by dinnertime. They bring out another hunk of chicken when that runs low, but not with the beef (edit 05/2014: and now they charge a premium for beef over chicken, for no reason)  Their falafel is good, but nothing that sets it apart. They also have soujuk (cured lebanese sausage) which is understandably salty, but tasty. The regular kebab is decent (but it's seasoned ground beef... not my fave)  Their burgers are average. I've had them a few times, and I've never been that impressed. Worst of all, they use bland-tasting processed cheese slices. Processed cheese should be outlawed.  My brother doesn't get the wrap combos. Instead, he gets their full dinner plates which are huge. The one he gets is the \"shooaf shish tawook with fries and salad\". One skewer of steak kebab, one skewer of chicken kebab, garlic and hummus as dips, and a side of fries and salad. While it is very plentiful, the price is steep, especially because it doesn't come with a beverage.  I've also had the \"Tahini Salad with Shawarma\" several times. It is very tasty. You get a nice portion of beef or chicken, and a large tahini salad. One of the best salads I've had. A ton of flavour. Plus you get a serving of garlic paste and hummus on the side for dipping. It's so good, I had to post a picture of it.  As for their sides? Their fries are great -- some of the best I've had. Their salads are decent (nothing special) and their soup is average at best. Stick with the fries.  Their \"combos\" come with a wrap + your choice of side + pop or water. You can also order sandwiches alone, and there are combos that include two sandwiches + a side + a drink.  SERVICE / SPEED It's friendly enough, but not overly welcoming. I suppose they are as polite as can be given that they are trying to hurry customers along, so as to not keep other customers waiting excessively.  They need to \"sell their product\" better. A woman in front of me asked what Shooaf is. I would have said \"they take a cut of steak, chop it into cubes, marinate it, and cook it rotisserie style\" ...but what did the employee say? \"Shooaf? It's beef chunks.\" Needless to say, the look on her face showed that she wasn't enticed by \"beef chunks\" and did not order that.  Everything except the shawarma is prepared only when ordered, so that means you will probably be waiting at least 15 minutes from when you pay until you are handed your plate -- and that is assuming it's not too busy. Just go there when you're not in a rush.  JUICE BAR I've never tried the 'juice bar', but I've been there enough to see it in action. From what I've seen: its cool that they blend fresh fruit right in front of you, but it takes them a long time. Expect a 6 minute wait for your beverage, more if it's busy.  VALUE This is where they lose. Consistently over the past 20-25 months, there have been steady price increases. As I said in my opening paragraph, we're talking a 40%+ increase in a short time.  Also, since Feb 2013, they now add a $1 surcharge if you ask for half chicken / half beef in your shawarma. I think that's ridiculous since they still give you the same amount of meat, and requires no additional effort (both meats are already cooked, they simply shave it off which takes 5 seconds)  For what you get, I thought their prices were borderline too-high before. Now? Sorry, no dice! Four stars for taste, knocked down to 3 for crappy value.  You're off my radar now, brother!"}
{"text":"Fine food Ample portions Light options Amiable staff Funky decor Expedited preparation Liked it a lot  Have gone twice in 10 days. Its all good."}
{"text":"ive been coming here ever since it just opened up at the corner of my neighborhood! awesome variety, and very friendly staff...  my favourite so far is the grilled shrimp sandwich and they cook the shrimp ABSOLUTELY EMINENT  i do in fact, highly recommend coming to this place.. my boyfriend and i always resort to this place for a late night snack ( yes, they do close late -11:45/12 am)   also, the place is filled with wooden/glass furniture, i find it really cozy and creative. they also have a sink in front of a cashier for washing your hands because the shawarmas/sandwiches are pretty messy sometimes...  enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very nice food . Tried the shrimp sandwich ! It's so good ! I would rate it around 4.5 stars . Leaving a review to remind myself to come back here again when in the area !"}
{"text":"The old Steak Queen, I've passed by this place numerous times.  Finally decided to pay a visit for some takeout.  The decor is a bit weird - old, island vibe feel.  It doesn't say anything Middle Eastern.    I ordered the beef shawarma plate (rice/salad) which was $14.99.  A tad expensive but the portion size was pretty big - 2 meals for me!  The beef kebabs were juicy and tender, the rice fluffy and flavourful.  Add the hot sauce and tahini on and you are packing a flavour punch in your mouth!  It does take a bit of time for you to get your order but there is plenty of seating inside while you wait.  In the summer the small patio section is open.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I always get their chicken shawarma plate. Always eat in, because you get a HUGE portion! If you order it takeout, I estimate you're only getting about 4/5 of it.  I order like this: chicken shawarma plate, italian dressing for the salad, extra tahini and hot sauce. Obviously, only order like this if you can handle spicy. And then ask for a takeout box when you're almost done eating because there's a good chance you can't finish it hahah snack for later! This comes out to roughly $12.50 after tax.  Sounds a bit expensive? Try ordering it first and see how much food you get and how tasty it is, and you may reconsider."}
{"text":"They used to very good back 2-3 years ago. The new owners have switched the suppliers and the quality of the food as dropped drastically since then.  Tried both beef and chicken dishes recently. Stale, old, rubbery and dry are the best words to describe it.  The worst part is they close early and they always run out of shawarma in the evenings."}
{"text":"Damas is this Middle Eastern diner of sorts. The place is rather large and the decor is a bit odd as it looked like something of a tropical place. I would imagine the tropical theme is to remind everyone that they also do fruit juices as well to go along with the Middle Eastern food.  I ordered the Shooaf Beef Kabab Pita. I've never really heard of Shooaf, and not even Google knows, so I'm guessing they came up with the word? Either way, it's grilled beef that is skewered and was actually nice and tender. The chunks were a bit small and the pita didn't hold the fillings in so well, but all the fillings like the hummus, hot sauce, garlic sauce, and such were all so damn tasty.   The service was super friendly. The guy making my sandwich was chatting the whole time he was putting everything together so that was a nice touch. They have family platters as well if you want to bring a crowd."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Rude guys despite the nice lady who took my order. Price, taste and quality of the food isn't worth the terrible service. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Came at around 8:30 PM where it wasn't too busy. The man on cash was friendly and told us to take our time with the menus and just come up when we're ready to order.  I got a Shawarma Tahini Salad. I have to add that the end result isn't quite like the picture on the menu, but the food is still great. The salad was freshly put together and tossed, and the chicken re-grilled to order. It was all pretty tasty.  It also picked up a bit again at the restaurant as people started coming in around 9 for some takeout."}
{"text":"My very local go-to! I love the staff. Very friendly. Great eats for some vegetarians and meat lovers; I highly recommend their shrimp sandwich and chicken shawarma. Super relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Huge portions at reasonable costs. We went here for dinner and I was impressed with the taste. Though hygiene wise I think it can do better.  Their shawarmas may not be the best but the sheesh taouk plates are simply brilliant. Mouth watering.  The decor is nice but service could be better. Tables are not so clean."}
{"text":"Friendly and laidbback staff.  AMAZING food and the atmospheres itself was pretty chill too. The wooden furniture and decor was just"}
{"text":"Very clean a spacious. I had the chicken Shawarma and my cousin had the shrimp sandwich. All the ingredients were fresh and the staff were friendly. I will definitely come back to try more of their menu options."}
{"text":"Already plenty of reviews here Since i've eaten here quite often and basically tried everything on the menu it is time i give it a rating   So i figure i'd keep it simple  The food choices are plenty The food is good The staff is caring and friendly the plates are carefully arranged the price is right  Compared to the old fast food layout of the place the investment in the carved wood look is a step above.  Nice place to have just as nice a dinner as a quick lunch"}
{"text":"Given it two shots and it was a three both times. Good sized portions certainly, but overcooked meat and a bland salad. On to next spot, maybe Damas is just not to my taste."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken and beef burgers - both were a little too peppery. Even though the burger I tried was mediocre, I still give this place a 3/5 because of the variety of options they give.   If I am in the area I would probably return to try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Food quality is very good and portions are huge.  I find that they lack a bit of consistency with the fusion of food flavors depending on which person assembles your meal.  Pricing is a bit on the higher side end of the spectrum - an average dinner price is about $13 - $15.  Take out option is better because the restaurant is quite dated with is ugly brown tiles, but don't judge a book by its cover - they food is tasty."}
{"text":"This is my go to place in Scarborough for middle eastern food. You can count on the food to be fresh, plentiful and reasonably priced - I love the shish tawook! I can see why this place is always so busy."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always love getting their salads especially the chicken tabouleh salad. If you need a shawarma fix, this is the place to be.  Also the people there are really nice."}
{"text":"Amazing Lebanese food the best by far I. The whole GTA and wicked cool log furniture... You must go!"}
{"text":"They have good rice, and overall their food is great"}
