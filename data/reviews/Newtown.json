{"text":"This place needs a facelift. 5 a 7s have definitely gone down, for many reasons:
- its empty
- strange crowd
- food is bad. i think a can of salmon would have been better than the salmon tartare.
- 2x1 beer is now two half pints, what a rip off"}
{"text":"My experience at Newtown, a fancy-looking restaurant in one of the trendiest parts of the city, reminded me that appearances can be deceptive. My suspicions towards this establishment arose after first seeing the menu: a dull list of commonplace dishes that one might find in any supermarket's frozen food lane. And indeed, I found out soon enough that my fears were justified. 

We started our meal with an appetizer of fried calamaris; bland and overcooked, they were hard to distinguish from thick pieces of rubber. Thankfully, they were served with an exquisite mix of Heinz ketchup and mayonnaise. Our main course, a scanty serving of beef tacos and chicken quesadillas, suffered from the same flaws. Oh well, I guess that the cook just ran out of salt, spices, and any form of seasoning whatsoever.

Looking on the bright side, my outrageous bill made my banker a richer man, and the wine shortage in my sangria surely pleased my doctor!"}
{"text":"WOW! I'm in shock with how bad our experience was here. Myself and 14 other girls came for a Bachelorette and I cannot stress how bad this place is. It took 25 mins to get water, up to one hour to get our drinks and our entrees were completely over cooked or missing components. The managers were totally indifferent even though 6 girls quietly complained about our experience. I feel bad because the waiter seemed like a nice guy but seriously, go to The Keg next time. I'm a total foodie and love going out to great restaurants but this was beyond ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Worst. service. ever.
We were the only table (15 people) out of the ENTIRE floor, and yet the 3 waiters there seemed to have better things to do than to serve us water or bread while waiting almost 2 hours for our mediocre food. We actually had to go grab random water pitchers and bread baskets from other empty tables - it was THAT bad. And the food? Soooo \"bleh\". Not worth the price tag AT ALL. Stay away, tourists. Montreal has so much better to offer - going there will make you think we have no idea how to run a restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant is great looking and that's what drew us in.  The staff were really friendly and enthusiastic but unfortunately the food is really bad.  I ordered the duck confit burger and found it dry and over cooked.  My wife ordered the lobster flat bread and it was inedible.  They used canned claw meat and tiny shrimp which went on the dough before it was cooked leaving the meat like sawdust.  Both the shrimp and lobster come from the can fully cooked and had they pit it on the bread after it was done in the oven the dish might have been okay.  Sadly whomever is cooking in this place is the weakest link.  The atmosphere is good, the drinks are good, and the staff are really nice.  Sadly, all that can't keep this place open if the food doesn't improve.  I wouldn't have called this place overpriced if the food was good but considering what we were served I have to say that it is."}
{"text":"The service was great until the new waitress took over, she had no patience and rushed us (my delicious glass of sangria was half full when she took it away). The food was great. I got salmon salad. And they offer hookah on the third floor, with beautiful view!"}
{"text":"For some reason Newtown has always been one of the places I frequent most for 5 a 7.  Not sure if its because its conveniently located, but I always start there with a group of people.  The drinks are a bit expensive, but they have the two for one deal during 5 a 7.  

The terrasse is especially nice during the summer.  The service can be a bit shoddy at times, and the food marginal, but I mainly go for drinking and I suggest you do too.

Also, I haven't seen a place with this much turnover in staff in a long time.  Every time I go there are new people."}
{"text":"We've only been here twice (this year and last) for the Montreal restaurant week and have been very impressed both times. I guess we must be \"bar-food\" people because the burgers/fries/desserts here really hit the spot. I agree with some other reviewers that the service can feel slow -- but I want to clarify that food is not slow to come out, and the service staff are very attentive. Rather, I think there is less pressure put on patrons to \"eat and leave\" -- so people accustomed to waiting less than five or ten minutes between finishing food and getting the check might find it too relaxed. Prices are not bad considering the level of service and ambiance you get from here. Sure you can spend $5 less for a burger across the street, but why would you want to? 

For what it's worth, we were here mid-week for dinner and had no problems getting seated or served quickly. We've never been here late-night on the weekend so I can't comment to service on a bustling night."}
{"text":"it wasn't our first time at Le Newtown and never their finger food tasted that good while at their Mojito Mania event last Friday! Especially their ceviche! WOW! Fresh seafood , well seasoned with a touch of spiciness exactly how I wanted. The only down side was we wished we had more, but that's just gluttony!"}
{"text":"I have been here for a few evening meals, never to the dance club, so I can't comment on that! The food in the restaurant was very good, ambiance is nice, upscale. Service was good, attentive, it was very busy each time I was there. The lunch menu is OK, tho I think there are better places for lunch in Montreal. I agree with other reviewers that the upstairs restaurant is the place to eat, but the downstairs bar/ lounge is not a bad place to hangout, have a drink and look at the beautiful Montrealers."}
{"text":"I had my wedding at The Newtown this past Saturday.  I cannot say enough nice things about the Director of Event, Julie and her assistant, Emilie who made sure that every single detail was perfect.  We were married on the second floor restaurant and the room is beautiful, full of light and elegant  The food was wonderful.  They recommended a terrific DJ.   Everything was first class with a smile."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Montreal and my boyfriend and I were here for a New Years.
It was amazing! From the time we stepped into the restaurant (we stayed in the lounge) until the time we left. There was a set menu because of it being New Years and the food was amazing!  It was quieter and a very nice place to be for the evening.
I'm also Vegan and they were able to accommodate me and the chef did an excellent job! The bartender (Ben?) and the manager(Omar) went above and beyond to make sure our stay was everything we needed it to be. The bartender was super friendly and did a great job. Omar made sure we got the best table and the best service. Thanks to all who made our visit one to remember.  Shout out to Raven who was hostess/waitress. Very friendly and we loved getting to know you. Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was disgusted by their service!!! I sat myself on the patio and waited for at least half an hour to get a drink from our server. No one approached our table. Irk and irritable, I went to the bar. Order our drinks, waited another 5/10 minutes for our drinks to arrive. Once it did, my martini tasted like club soda.  I know I like my drinks stiff but my martini tasted like a water down soda. I should've saved my money and just ordered a 7-up. The manager, a young lady approached us about experience. My husband informed her how disappointed I was and she said she would have another drink order for us right away. Thirty minutes later passed and never came. I gave up and left. This place left a sour taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"We were 8 and i don't think anyone was happy with their food. My fish was served with uncooked quinoa, so crunchy that it hurts your teeth.  The waitress didn't check on us once,  only came to pick up the plates at the end. Im going to leave this review short, just don't go there to eat. Montreal has so much to offer, spare yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"Went there after buying some taster coupons from \" Vie Urbaine\" 
Bought 4 coupons and went there twice with a friend.
First time 18th of April 2014, second time June 21st, 2014
The firs time I was very satisfied about the meal and the size of the plates since it was considered \"taster\" meal coupons.
Second not so much, the size of the plates, for the same special coupons, was about half of the size of my first time.
Even the beer was more expensive than the first time (first time I took Newcastle imported beer bottle and second time Heineken draft glass for 2 dollar more)
and to tap it all they even made 2 mistake on my bill. charged me for an Entr√©e and 2 more dessert than what we took. a mistake of about 45$ total... 
was very disappointed...
If the deal was to get new clients...didnt work at all with me"}
{"text":"If you think 5 glasses of wine, 12 pieces of calamari, 3 radishes, 4 pieces of limp celery, 4 actually pretty good cherry tomatoes, 4 red pepper slices so old they were going wrinkly, and one half filled condiment tin of philly cream cheese instead of dip for $100
 bucks is a good deal then you'll love it! Oh, and the waitress told us the owner made them serve the owners home brew wine when we were joking about how bad the Cabernet Sauvignon was. We're talking box grade people. 

Played out wannabe hip joint with food as aged and wrinkly as its clientele. NewTown. phpphht! More like OldAssTown!"}
{"text":"The Newton....

Went there on a date on a Friday night for dinner overall it was a nice experience. The atmosphere was hip and cool, sorta private , the drinks were good. The food wasn't something id die and go to heaven for.

 I ordered a salad for appetizer it was good. For my main course I had beef short ribs and Mascarpone  polenta. The portion was ridiculously small and left me hungry. I had 4 mouthfulls and my plate was empty :( 

 On the other hand The food tasted sublime.  Ive been to Newton a couple of times before, and  their menu had more choices. This time there was only one page , I didn't really have much to choose from. 

The service was not the best , the waitress forgot to bring our bread and when I asked for it I was solid cold! No water. We had to ask numerous times.

I would definitely go again during the summer  but only for drinks on their terrasse.

1 appetizer salad,1 plate of beef short ribs,1 Angus Beef Strip Loin 12.oz , 2 drinks  = 108.00$

Conclusion: the drinks were good but ill pass on the food. Paying this much and still hungry after is  NO BUENO!"}
{"text":"I like everything about this place except the staff! very rude, very unhelpful, but I still go there because of their good drinks."}
{"text":"As nice as this place looks, I always find myself disappointed..I've been to Newtown several times and have always been frustrated with either the slow service or the bland food.

Drinks are fine...prices are okay...but the food.....just stay away from it. Even things like a charcuterie platter or quinoa salad tend to get messed up at this place.

If you want to grab a couple drinks, all is well. Otherwise, not so much.."}
{"text":"if one had to choose 2 words to describe Newtown, these words are mediocre and  indifferent.  

Mediocre:  the spinach salad arrived with so many about-to-turn-to-compost leaves that it could not be consumed.  I asked the server if the chef even looked at the salad he / she prepared.   No interest in responding in a meaningful manner.

Indifferent:  our server wiped the table near us (everyone had fish at that table) and then proceeded to wipe our table with the same cloth.   Our table became an instant reminder of fried fish residue.   We had to change the table."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bars to go to, average age is i'd say around 40+ for Diner, 30-35 a little later for Drinks. This is because NT is on the more expensive side. Overall, waitresses are gorgeous, drinks are amazing, music is good. 4 out of 5 because I never actually ate there. 
Best thing about Newtown is the Terrace ( only open during summer ofcourse )"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a long time.  The only positive thing about this place was the hostess.   She was very nice when she sat us down.  The food took an hour to reach the table.... after I asked when our table could expect our food.   I was told it was on its way... it took another 15 minutes to arrive after I asked about the status.  The food, once it arrived, was not hot.... was not tasty.... it was bad.   My pork chop was as dry as Phoenix in August.   The staff never apologized for the delay.... the waitress was useless.   It was a train wreck.   Stay away!!!!"}
{"text":"Bon service, menu int√©ressant, bon prix. J'y retourne? Peut-√™tre"}
{"text":"Of all the bars and lounges we visited in Montreal, i'd say that this was my fave. 
It was classy, lounge-y, somewhat low-key, the patrons were not creepy or annoying and the servers both nites were very nice and efficient. 
I'd recommend for a nite out of town"}
{"text":"I visited Montreal on Formula 1 weekend (worldcup opening weekend also) soo this street was overcrowded so as Newtown! the DJ played lots of oldskool, I recommend it more for a 25+ crowds, drinks where not too strong maybe it was because of the overcrowd going on."}
{"text":"Pas vraiment dans mes cordes, j'ai r√©cemment fait une visite au Newtown pour y prendre quelques drinks. Bon choix de drink, services sympathique, ambiance bcbg, je comprends l'attrait que peu avoir l'endroit pour sa client√®le. Le menu semblait int√©ressant mais pas assez pour que j'y retourne. 
La bo√Æte de nuit adjacente, r√©serv√© pour un party priv√©, est tr√®s bien aussi mais il y avait d√©finitivement un probl√®me de vestiaire."}
{"text":"I was not particularly impressed with this place.  The meal started out promising enough with the goat cheese appetizer.  However, my cod entree with potatoes was served with some sort of sauce that I could not quite describe.  Perhaps I just didn't suit my taste, but it just wasn't that good.  

The service was friendly, if a bit slow at times, especially considering there were only like four tables eating at the restaurant (we got there after 10PM).  

The upstairs bar and downstairs bars were packed, so perhaps this is more of a nightlife location as opposed to a dining location."}
{"text":"Staff et client√®le sympa"}
{"text":"We chose this place because we wanted beef tartare. Worst experience ever. I picked a cocktail - off. I picked another - off. I ordered a 3rd one and it never turned up. We ordered tartare and they didn't have anymore. I complained. I asked to see a manager - none ever turned up. In the end, they \"found\" a portion of beef tartare which my date had since it was his birthday. I ordered salmon tartare, which was a ridiculously small portion, with two small cubes of water melon as an accompaniment. That is what I call taking the piss. The waitress was lovely; it wasn't her fault and she listened and apologised, but I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"Service is soooooo slowwwwww. I went with 3 of my girls for dinner and drinks. There was one bar tender there who was also tending to all the tables as a waiter also. There were so many ladies who also worked there but all they were doing was walking around aimlessly. I'm not exactly sure what their job was at this place. It took forever for us to get our orders in, then get our food.  And when our bill finally came the waiter forgot about us and didn't realize he hadn't come around to take the payments. Food was nothing special. Ros√© sangria was good. I will never come here again and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been to Newtown before for drinks but never to eat. I ate lunch during F1 weekend and (somehow) managed to find a table. For an appetizer, I had the Caesar salad. It was quite good, a classic Caesar salad with croutons, bacon and homemade dressing. I then had the oysters which were good - certainly not show stoppers. I had a couple of bloody caesars which were OK, nothing to write home about. The bill came and for what I got, I felt I overpaid. Overpriced, over-hyped, under-delivered."}
{"text":"This is a good place to find decent wine, by the glass.  The first floor lounge is modern and somewhat trendy.  Prices are above average, but service is good.  An excellent club to show off that pretty (little) black dress once the evening gets rolling."}
{"text":"The place is really nice and trendy looking. Unfortunately, we weren't able to go to the terrasse because it was raining like crazy. The service started out very well right up until it started becoming very buzy (there were a few party tables here and there). The waiter took forever to serve us our after-meal coffee and afterwards our bill. The food on the other hand was delicious! For appetizers, my BF had the salad and I had the salmon tartar. The presentation and perfect mixture of flavors was amazing. We then had the cod dish and the chicken with mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes. The cod was perfectly cooked, the chicken was slightly dry to my liking, but the mashed potatoes was so smooth and butterliscious =P We ended the meal with a dark chocolate tart and a \"special\" fruit salad. Mind you, there is nothing special about the fruit salad other than its presentation (served in a small Mason jar on a wooden platter). The chocolate tart was good though. Regarding pricing, pretty reasonable for some good tasting food, but not if you're looking to stuff your face out. Also, 10$ for a tiny piece of tart and 10$ for a tiny fruit salad? Really?"}
{"text":"Once again they do a top notch job.  (did i just write top notch?)

Great service here, good food too.  we ate off the dinner menu, but in the lounge.  thought id shake things up a bit.

Found a nicely priced tasty New Zealand wine to sip on and everything was great.

Takes Amex here."}
{"text":"Disclosure: we just drank on the rooftop. Nice looking place.  Cool bartender.  Stiff drinks."}
{"text":"Newtown is a visually deceiving place.  From the outside, the staircase leading to the main floor looks like an intimate restaurant/lounge but once inside, it's actually fairly huge.

Inside, it's gray and white minimalist decor with low violet lighting (or at least I thought it was violet lighting).

Towards the back  are two sets of staircase, one leading to the terrace for the summertime and another staircase leading to the bar downstairs.

Everyone one of the staff was really cool and accomodating which was refreshing considering the type of service received during a New Year's party.  They didn't have Tanqueray for the open bar package which was fine since the Gin & Tonics still tasted good and not watered down.

The music was was a mix of electro house, hip hop and top 40 music kept the crowd moving till 2am.

Overall, the experience was great and a lot of fun and I'd definitely come back when I'm in Montreal again."}
{"text":"I try really hard not to give a negative review but I just have to this time around. I'm at a 5a7 and ordered the angus burger. It was a brick and dry, I couldn't even take a bite. They offered to change it, I refused because it was awful. Never again will I eat here."}
{"text":"***Montreal Burger Week*** Since it was my last night off of the week I decided to take advantage and get at least one contender for the Montreal Burger Week under my belt so that I wouldn't have missed the whole thing like last year. Newtown was near to my destination and I had about an hour to kill so when I saw the instagrammed photo I just had to try it. Burger, toasted bun, cheddar cheese, fried egg, onions, chipotle mayo, and a nice big patty. Not just any patty, a patty that consisted of pulled pork surrounded by angus beef and then wrapped in bacon. Gluttony for punishment? Don't mind if I do! I'm glad I took a salad as my side or else I probably would have gotten heart palpitations, but it also gave the kitchen a chance to let me taste their wonderfully balanced yet tangy salad dressing. Yum. The only thing I would have added would have been to top it with quick-fried onions or caramelized onions instead but even with the regular onions the burger was top notch. 


so... full... but... want... another..."}
{"text":"super pricey for what you're getting, pretty good cocktails, good service.

The food is crazy over-priced here (maybe it's a Montreal thing), so too were the drinks. BUT, on the other hand, this was the only place I could find in the downtown-touristy area that had a bottle of Angostura bitters, so the pretty friendly barkeep, tough he'd never heard of it before, let me walk him through an Old Fashioned, which was great (and I'd been looking for an Old Fashioned for days by that point, but nobody carried bitters). Also tried their version of a pomegranate mojito, which was also done really well - tart instead of sugary, which I liked.

The decor is shamcy-low-key, mood lightning, swanky. It felt great to get out of the snow for two hours and feel a little chic, and I was really happy to have a good bartender, but I don't think I'd be back again. Trop cher pour moi.

[this will mean very little to most people, but Le Newton found an AMAZING designer to do their business cards. I want to know who's responsible. They're incredible.]"}
{"text":"This one star goes to the waiter/bartender/busboy/Goodness knows what else that helped us whenever he could. He was very polite. The rest of the staff walked about to nowhere, coming in and out of view briefly. The chicken Cesar salad -- indeed looked magnificent, but tasted less than average. There was no description, so if you don't eat bacon, be sure to let them know! It took about an hour to order, 30/40 minutes to get our food, & another 30/40 minutes JUST to pay! The fish tacos are actually fish burritos. The only thing nice about this place besides the waiter of all hats was the ambience/style of the place. If you're in the mood for inedible chicken, long wait times, and watching a person work themselves to death, Newtown is the place for you! 
PS. They ran out of beef by 8:30pm & had a frozen drink menu just to tease you -- the ice machine didn't work."}
{"text":"The pasta ordered here was nothing but carbs  - almost no vegetables, etc. - I would not suggest this place - it's a huge rip off."}
{"text":"In the second floor, there is a gourmet restaurant, which in my opinion is one of the best of Montreal... or Maybe, Canada!!.. every dish we tried was AWESOME!!!.. The chef was the best Chef of Canada some months ago, and we realized why he won that award!!.. He really deserve it!! .. In my opinion one of the best gourmet food I've tried in Montreal!!...  the service was great and the wine was delicious!!.. I would like to go back there a lot of times more!!..."}
{"text":"Nice drink menu and a great balcony with a view of the city. Much better than the club/pub options down the street. Very trendy vibe but worth it to avoid loud club beats on a weekend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant looks nice. But that's just about it. The service is superbly slow, the prices are high for what is ostensibly sub par preparation of the menu items, which are quite limited (though they receive one star for plating presentation). The servers seem to try, but there are clearly the organizational issues which clearly mitigate them from performing as well as this place touts itself to be. Looks can be deceiving, and this place is a prime example of that."}
{"text":"This is a review for their rooftop bar. It's kind of fancy. There's table service and a few seats at the bar. They do both cocktails and beer.

We were originally offered a table inside, but then the waitress realized it was reserved. Not a problem, as she eventually gave us a nice couch and table outside on the patio. If you go to the edge, there's a lot of people watching on Crescent, which is always fun.

It's only the second (or third?) floor, so not exactly spectacular views, but I don't know if that's expected in Montreal.

They were playing great music, but it didn't seem like many people were dancing. We gave it some time, but it was mostly people coming in and eating/drinking at the tables outside. So more of a loungey feel than a club, which was a shame since the dance floor was pretty wide open.

Good whiskey selection too!"}
{"text":"My coworkers came here for dinner our first night in Montreal (a Monday) and were not impressed. Apparently on Sunday & Monday the regular restaurant is closed so there is only a bar menu.

We didn't realize this until we sat down after just sprinting in to get out of a thunderstorm. 

The decor is the nicest part - modern and funky with nice open windows (luckily the rain wasn't coming in!) and a good view of Crescent St. 

There was only one waitress working who was doing her best (to be fair), but she needed help. She was scrambling around and we had to track her down for everything from menus to ordering and getting the check.

Food was kind of a joke. The menu was not cohesive or complementary at all. Charcuterie plates, hamburgers, and grilled cheese? 

Prices were also ridiculous (the grilled cheese was $1 more than the hamburger?) and not worth it. 

I'd stay away."}
{"text":"We were drawn to this place because of the outdoor terrace on a nice day.  

I see there's a lot of reviews that said their service was slow.  We didn't even receive ANY service!  We literally waited 20 minutes before fetching menus for ourselves.  After they saw we had menus, they still never came to take our order after another 15.  We of course got up and walked out as the servers just watched us leave without a word.

If you want to enjoy a terrace and not have to buy anything or be bothered, this is the place for you!  If you want to know what it's like to have an invisibility superpower, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Never come here. The attention is ridiculously rude. They asked us to consume or otherwise leave the place. Pathetic. Avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"The place was really nice and the terrace was a hot spot. The hookah was ok nothing serious and the service was not the best! Other then that they would've probably gotten 4 or 5 stars. I would give this place another chance if I'm in town..."}
