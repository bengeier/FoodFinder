{"text":"Celebrated New Job Here On A Tuesday Night With Great Patio View, Slight Breeze For A Arizona Summer And Watched Surrounding Storm In The Distance-Five Stars For View.  Wait Staff All Were Prompt, Helpful And Knew The Menu - Five Stars For Staff.  Manager Checked In On Us And Greeted Us With Warmth And Smile, Cares About Our Comments.   We ordered The White Shrimp Tacos And Steak Sandwich, Bread Came First, Great Bread! On Our Motorcycles (BMW) So Only Water Tonight As We Hold To No Drinking And Riding.  Tacos Were Fun, Tasty, Sauce Was Great.  Steak SandwichWas Above The ToP With Presentation And Flavor.  To Ring In The Celebration We Shared The Lemon-Lime Sour Cream Pie With All The Fixings- The Pie Alone Is Reason To Go Back Again.  Overall We Were Treated As Special Guests From First Foot In The Door To Last Step Out.  We Loved The Dining Experience."}
{"text":"This place used to be a favorite and it has really gone down hill  I won't go there any more .. Food is not fresh and when you send it back the manger argues the point with you .. It used to be so good really disappointing!"}
{"text":"We love this course as it is close to our house and a swift 18 holes. The restaurant didn't meet our standard though. The menu was just standard, the service was dreadful. Over an hour for lunch is too long and we were beginning to wonder if they were complimenting the meal since we couldn't pay a soul! Not to mention what we had to pay, in my opinion, was a bit more than it was worth. Overall, our experience here really put a damper on our day so next time we'll eat at the little local place off the highway  just before coming into the community / golf course."}
