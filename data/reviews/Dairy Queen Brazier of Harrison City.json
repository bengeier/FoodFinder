{"text":"Great DQ! Never had any trouble with this place. Gets busy at times but they work like clockwork there."}
{"text":"I love this town but this DQ is nothing but problems.  Most recently, I ordered a Coke.  I drank some while at the restaurant and took the rest home.  I left it on my counter that night and went to throw it away the next morning and noticed something moving around in the cup.  I dumped it out and out come the soda machine nozzle which was also dirty.  Thank goodness it wasn't something smaller that could have choked a child and thank goodness it wasn't in my child's drink. Ewwww!  Also, last September, my kids and I went through the drive through and ordered a kids grilled cheese meal for one of my daughters.  We could see inside the building, there were no customers, but plenty of workers on their cell phones.  It's crazy how my 10 year old made a comment \"wow, look at all of them on their cell phones\".  So, we ordered and went home.  My daughter opened up her grilled cheese and found 1 slice of bread with non melted cheese placed on top.  There wasn't a second piece of bread and the cheese wasn't melted.  I did call that night and they gave us a new meal.  I would be embarrassed to know things like this were happening if this was my business.  In fact, my family did own a Dairy Queen and I would be livid to know employees are making these errors and not mindful of what they are doing.    I have pictures of both situations. I called today about the Coke and I requested to speak to the owner as I would think that would be someone who would really care.  The first person I talked to said that the owner would tell me the same thing as the Supervisor.  They then got me to a Supervisor, Carissa, who apologized and said that the worker must not have noticed that thing fell into my drink because It's dark and my drink was dark. She said she did find out the next morning that they were missing the nozzle.   She was going to pass on my name and number to the owner but they aren't sure when she would come in.    I can see on Yelp as well as hearing comments from friends of mine in the area that this DQ has a really bad reputation and I think it's time for the owner to make some change to make something good for this community."}
{"text":"gross..gave food poisoning!!!!!this dairy queen is nothing but a bunch of big fat gross hogs that are eating the profit and are dirty as hell. the hamburgers made us sick.fries where rock hard as if they microwaved them after sitting out for days. this place is a feeding ground for bacteria as the staff is too fat to be able to move let alone clean stuff. management should fire everyone."}
{"text":"Boo. Dairy Queen hamburgers and fries used to be so much better.  This Dairy Queen has lots of parking and is clean.  It's also in a pretty convenient location.  The bottom line, though, for fast food cheeseburgers, when I was hungry for one, I used to like Dairy Queen.  Now, I'd probably go somewhere else.  My advice: go to Dairy Queen for desert, not for dinner."}
{"text":"I love DQ.  Especially this place.  It is near and dear to my heart because it was the local ice cream place growing up.  It is where everyone went after the school band shows, soccer games, football games, and anything else that drew a crowd.  This DQ always came through.  I have always had great ice cream here.  Usually I order a blizzard every time, but I have sampled other peoples desserts and have found them to also be delicious.  Even their hot food here is great.  The only reason they dont get a 5star is because of their ridiculous prices for food.  They seriously need to come up with a dollar menu because I am never going to pay 7 dollars for a few strips of chicken.  Also on a side note, dont charge me 80 cents for a cup of water...   Other than their prices, DQ is defiantly the place to go for your craving of ice cream.  Nobody does soft serve better."}
{"text":"The food: It's not even good as DQs typically go. The ice cream: It's consistent with every other DQ."}
