{"text":"Nice little breakfast place. Loved the homemade pancakes! Favorite place for a Sunday breakfast. Service was very cool too!!"}
{"text":"I am giving it two stars because I've only ever had delivery. I've never eaten at the restaurant so maybe there is a difference. 
I've ordered this twice from uber eats and both times it was terrible. I've only ever eaten turkey bacon during my life so I know how it should be cooked... it looked like it came straight out of the package. Bread was stale. Rubbery eggs. Not Done How I asked. 
Probably only good thing was their pancakes. They did forget the syrup though. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"great place! came here for breakfast, price was reasonable, and food was good. I found it a bit hard to find because the sign was hard to see. Service was great! Our server was amazing and would come back again."}
{"text":"Over cooked burger. Flat warm beer. Told me they had balsamic vinaigrette and just brought out straight vinegar. When I complained they went back and added oil. Too bad as this place is very close but I promise I will never go back again"}
{"text":"Good eggs benny, homemade hollandaise, not from a mix. Great service. Friendly environment. Would go back."}
