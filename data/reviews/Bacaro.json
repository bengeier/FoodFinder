{"text":"The restaurant was hosting a dinner conference when we went there, but the place is clearly not equipped for such private events. We were forced to listen to a guest M.D. present a PowerPoint talk on male sexual dysfunction for almost an hour while we were having dinner. It was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation at our own table. It was a very unpleasant dinner. A good restaurant is not just about food, but also about ambience. The atmosphere was absolutely horrible for the customers who were not part of the conference.   The soup was also extremely salty.   This place tries to be fancy, certainly in price, but it is only mediocre in both taste and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have NEVER ever had a bad dish here. The service was always so spot on, but then again that might just be because they know me. I am always impressed with the ideas Thad's crew thinks of...and I am such a fan of ANYTHING the dessert Chef Allison makes, that girl is incredible!  Sure it is pricey, but it is mostly local products, which makes me more than happy to fork over more. They seem to be particular to detail, which is a plus to me! The wine is top notch too.  Honestly, anyone who finds Bacaro pretentious must be insecure, or needs to be more social. Good Lord, fine dining people!! You pay for what you get.  ALSO!! Thad has also mentioned to me how he likes his business to have less seating so its about quality, and not quantity. RESPECT that!!  I think I need to save to go there again, so worth it!!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about Bacaro.  When I was a student at the University, my (now husband) and I would go here for anniversaries and special days, and he even proposed to me here! So I must say that although I have emotional bias, my love of their service, ambiance, wine and FOOD remains true.  We love their innovative cocktail selection, and wine pairings (which the friendly and knowledgeable staff helps you choose if you would like).  I love their Market Monday dinners using local ingredients and varying week to week.  But most of all I love their totally original, one-of-a-kind, tasting menu (literally the chef does something different every night!). While it is a bit pricey, it is more than worth it for the quality of food and overall experience (you would pay double if they were in Chicago and not Champaign).  I live in Chicago now and Bacaro is definitely on par with any James Beard or Michelin-recommended restaurant in the city. I just wish I had more so I could come to Champaign (just for Bacaro) more often."}
{"text":"worst restaurant downtown, I tried the tasting menu twice, the first time looks great, but recently I don't know what happened, the food looks terrible, taste terrible, overlooked, salty , and even bitter, we spent 300+ for two , I feel like I just want to pay 3 dollars."}
{"text":"Bacaro is often spectacular. Outside of Daniel, in New York City, I don't think I've had food this subtle, refined and exquisite anywhere else - something I don't say lightly, as I am well aware I'm talking about a restaurant in Champaign, Illinois. Yet, we have such a restaurant and it's a shame we don't trumpet it more.  The pros: The service. The staff is exceptionally well-trained, smooth, and (almost) flawless.  The dishes. Creative, never boring, always executed well. And also always worth it.   The attitude. Everyone at Bacaro takes operating a restaurant seriously. Bacaro is professional to the core, and proud of it. So, seats aren't ripped, napkins aren't fraying at the edges (even slightly), dirt hasn't built up in corners, the decor isn't allowed to grow stale, the food never leaves the kitchen unless it's up to very high standard.  The Chef buys locally - and has for a long time.  The decor. Modern, it's visually interesting without feeling \"cold.\" Love the bathrooms and the cloth towels.  Location. Downtown Champaign is always fun.  Their tasting menus. Spring for it and try one. They can be food revelations.  The cons: A lot of people in C-U are unnerved by Bacaro. I've had friends and co-workers describe it as \"too fancy,\" \"too elite,\" \"too cool\" for them (I disagree, but what can you do with someone's insecurities?) That dismissal shows up in other reviews here, too.   The dishes. Sometimes all that creativity is just too much. Even though they're really, really good, it's sometimes hard to get geared up for appetizers like \"fried watermelon\" and \"popcorn with truffle oil.\""}
{"text":"Always incredible. Although I often can't pronounce most of what's on the menu, the servers are always more than willing to explain the menu with great detail and offer their recommendations. If I could afford to eat there more than three times a year, I would."}
{"text":"Celebrated early retirement with 7 of us and thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu and Benjamin's service!  Would highly recommend!  Food, wine, presentation and service were exceptional!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I just went to Bacaro for my girlfriend's birthday and got some mixed feelings about it. Here's what we ordered:  Grilled veal chop with red beets and pearl onions Grilled sirloin with red cabbage, potatoes, and braised oxtail, in a red wine reduction  Apple cake with creme fraiche ice cream Chocolate brownie with graham cracker ice cream and roasted marshmallows Persimmon and pistachio bread pudding   The entree and wine were splendid, although a bit on the salty side for the sirloin. However, the dessert left a lot to be desired, in particular the persimmon and pistachio bread pudding. It was just plain soggy and tasteless. I recommend not ordering dessert here if you do plan on coming.   In regards to the waitress and hostess, they were very helpful and courteous, in contrast to many of the other reviewers who saw them as \"snooty\" and pretentious. The atmosphere was pleasant and the ambient music was suitable for the occasion."}
{"text":"I have had more consistently amazing and memorable meals at Bacaro than any other restaurant in Illinois.  Bacaro continues to define the Italian aesthetic of minimalism while utilizing local fresh farm products with a midwestern voice that speaks of regional agricultural values more than any other modern middle American restaurant.   Bacaro has been a pioneer of local cooking in Illinois for nine years and has also supported local farmers long before farmers market culture was cool and \"local\" was a marketing term and Chili's featured \"organic\" produce.  One might be inclined to draw similarities between Bacaro in Champaign and regional French cooking in Burgundy, Basque restaurants in Northern Spain and Italian restaurants in rural Marche. What do all of these places have in common?   Each are located in rural farming communities featuring creative Chefs who are utilizing traditional techniques along with a bounty of fresh, healthy, locally available ingredients in an inspired and innovative way that showcases the soul and terrior of the region.   Bacaro may be one of the most relevant regional restaurants in the middle of America along with Michael Symon's Lola in Cleveland and Proof on Main in Louisville.   Bacaro is a restaurant that goes the extra mile for their guests utilizing locally raised organic meats, house made cured proscuitto, fruit and vegetable marmelatta, as well as a plethora of the seasonal vegetables.  The emphasis here is simple: clean, pure flavors features some of the best ingredients available in 2009. From imported fish from Browne Trading Company www.brownetrading.com to fresh produce from Spence Farms www.thespencefarm.com, Bacaro utilizes only the finest ingredients.  Bacaro does not cut corners where quality is concerned. The same cannot be said if most restaurants in the wolrd; especially in college towns.  I have read reviews that proclaim Bacaro to be expensive, yet I'm not sure that I understand the complaint, as I just see an amazing value in regional gastronomy amid a sea of indifference and corporate foodstuff.  Prices here are quite low compared to the same ingredients served at restaurants of the same quality just two hours North.  If you want cheap industrial food, Steak n' Shake is CU's preferred restaurant of choice and is open 24/7. Enjoy.  On to the wine, which is my favorite subject.   Along with Farren's and Timpone's, Bacaro is a pioneer in CU for quality wine presented in a smart and innovative manner.   Where else can you find a selection of quality artisan wines served in beautiful glassware in Champaign?   Bravo to Bacaro for towing the quality line with regards to beverage service and not succumbing to the pressure to dumb down their creative selection for the masses! CU deserves more than Jameson and PBR.   Some of my favorite Bacaro dishes have included fresh morels (hand foraged from woods near Springfield) with new olive oil, Sicilian sea salt and chili flakes on bruschetta; organic hangar steak with 80 year old balsamic (transcendental); and a fresh Spanish baby glass eel salad. If any of the other Yelpers out there know of any other restaurants in North America serving fresh (live) baby glass eels from Spain, please educate me.  Overall, I recommend coming to this restaurant if you are ready to have a great time and relax while celebrating the beauty of the sweet life. La Dolce Vita.  If you are a parent of a U of I student and hail from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Miami, Tokyo, Moscow, Seville, Paris or Montreal, you will feel right at home in one of the premier regional US restaurants.  Yes, you will pay for the high quality ingredients; yet one will certainly appreciate the sophistication of the presentation, sex appeal of the ambience and attention to conviviality of service as well as the value of the menu.   As a Chicago restaurateur, I can safely say that Bacaro is a culinary beacon in an otherwise dimly lit universe of Midwestern restaurants.  If you are a fan of www.lolabistro.com or www.blackbirdrestaurant.com or www.sorellanyc.com or www.proofonmain.com, then check out Bacaro.   If not, I recommend you head straight to www.steaknshake.com   It is very inexpensive and has very large portions.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Bacaro is a restaurant that I would reserve for a special occasion....or just to treat yourself to something a little different.  My favorite is the Market Monday prix fixe menu with ingredients selected from the saturday farmers market.  to go from fresh local ingredients on saturday morning to a full 5 course meal and wine pairings by monday night is pretty spectacular.  The last couple market night meals that i have been to have been around 40 dollars, and for an additional 25, you can get some awesome wines (highly recommended). The courses are so elegantly prepared with amazing presentation and you won't go home hungry.  I've noticed the dishes are a little too salty for my taste... actually, they're consistently salty to me (but then again this is coming from someone who barely ever salts their food) but i think you can get around it by indulging less in the amazing sauces.  and the desserts-- so delicious.  the desserts truly capture the seasons and the feel of the weather so perfectly.  I honestly don't know a better way to start the week!  if you have a bad case of the mondays, treat yourself to some bacaro.  and your spirits will be lifted.   I have gone several times and enjoyed several of the menu items, and a few market nights (i hear they're introducing an occasional VEGETARIAN!!!! market menu!!) and i have never been disappointed.  The service is great, and they are very attentive.  Some servers are more knowledgeable about the wines and others know a little more about the food and preparation, but overall, they are a pleasant and fun to talk to group.  If you ask them a question and they don't know the answer, they are probably equally curious to know the answer as well-- meaning they will find you an answer even if it means hounding the chef :-)   I think you definitely get what you pay for.  and for a city like champaign, bacaro is definitely a lovely gem."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I've only been their twice since each meal costs half a months rent.  It's totally worth it though. Also, the waiters are great with the wine parings, I've had some of the best wine experiences of my life here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic restaurant!  I ate here about a year ago and it was wonderful.  Superb wine list.  Many local, farm fresh ingredients.  Tasty dishes.  Good atmosphere.  Fine dining.   Great service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner.  We decided to go to Bacaro on the Sunday of Labor Day weekend thinking it would be nice to avoid the crowds on a Friday or Saturday night.  It is a beautiful, modern looking restaurant.   When you walk in, there are two rooms -- the first room behind the hostess stand has more room and tables are further apart.  The second room to the right behind the hostess stand has the long bar in it and tables are very close together down the left side of the room (one long \"banquette\" sofa on one side of the tables).  The 3 or 4 tables in front of the window in this room were all taken already.    We had high hopes for the restaurant given the reviews we'd read / heard and that it has been open for quite a long time, would seem to be a tried and true restaurant.  (My hobby since high school 20+ years ago has been finding / going to good restaurants at home and travelling.)  But first strike happened right off the bat with the hostess.  Apparently they were not seating in the first room -- she showed us two tables, one not cleaned off in the middle of the seating on the left and the other in the very back corner next to an already occupied table.  Since it was a special night, we really didn't want to be shoved in a corner so we asked for the middle table.  Wonder why she wouldn't have cleaned off the table first and then asked us which one we would like?    The tables are uncomfortably close together -- a group of 3 was to our right.  No one was at the two tables next to us.  Second strike -- instead of trying to give people space that was available, the hostess set a couple right next to us instead of a table over.  We found out later that the next room did end up being used and we could have had a table with much more room / privacy.  It was awkward all evening being that close to two other tables.    Third strike -- it was apparent very quickly that the restaurant had only two waiters handling the whole restaurant.  I don't know if someone didn't show up or if it was poor planning.  Maybe they thought it would be a quiet night and that two would do it.  We could tell our waitress was harried from the moment she arrived at our table and as I watched her throughout the evening, she never stopping running from the kitchen throughout the room.  I'm sure she was one tired girl by the end of the evening.    Fourth strike -- we don't drink and ordered ice teas.  No sugar offered and she was so busy we hated to even bother her.  Finally at some point we managed to sneak in the ask.  But why did we have to ask.    Fifth strike -- three of the items I was interesting in choosing from for my entree had mint in them.  I am not a big fan of mint so when the waitress came to take our order -- I needed to know if I could have the kitchen hold the mint on whatever I ordered.  She said she could check but then waited to take our order which I really couldn't give until I knew the answer.  Awkward moment.  So after hem hawing a moment she finally headed to the kitchen to ask.  I felt bad because I knew she was harried and didn't need this (and I didn't want to make the chef(s) mad (i.e. \"soup nazi\"?!) but at the same time if I'm going to pay close to $100 for a dinner for two, surely I can ask?  (Later the lady at the table next to me also had a special request for the kitchen which made me feel better!)  Fortunately, they were able to accept my request.    The dinner started off with an amuse bouche of a tiny square of frittata.  It was cute, one of those fun things you get at nice restaurants but just okay.  I wished I had ordered the heirloom tomatoes as a starter but got flustered because of the above -- we both ended up ordering a salad w/ goat's cheese and peaches.  The peaches were heavenly, deliciously ripe, sweet, and juicy  -- my husband ate every last bite of his salad but mine had too many stemmed pieces of lettuce so I didn't do as well.    Sixth strike -- I had ordered the shrimp risotto and my husband had ordered chicken.  I noticed on the menu that it was $28 and thought hmm.....  Mine was fine, not blow-me-away good (which was too bad because risotto I had recently at Silvercreek was WAY better) but husband's chicken....... well, you know that credit card commercial on tv where the couple goes out for a nice dinner and they get so little food, they go out for sandwiches afterward?  That's the kind of dinner my husband had at Bacaro.  It arrived on a large white plate with nothing on it but a sliced chicken breast, a chicken leg, and essentially a chopped garnish of picked corn, bacon, etc.  And NOTHING else.  He was stil hungry after he ate it.  (He was already asking what would be for breakfast that night when we went to bed because he was still hungry.)  I read someone else's review on Yelp that also said $28 for chicken?!  (yelp says I'm out of space, will have to finish in another post.)"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G.  I'm originally from NY and was visiting the area.  This place blew my mind it was so good.  We chose to do the tasting menu which was about 6 courses, complete with a cheese course and dessert.  I paired it with the wines too. The wine list was definitely impressive.  Lots of interesting wines at very fair prices. They are considered a wine bar, so I was hoping for a good list.  But I was impressed with the prices, there were many bottles on the list for under $30 which is always great to me.  It's easy to fill a list with great expensive bottles, but it is indeed very difficult to pick a variety of great wines at reasonable prices. The wines paired perfectly with each dish, I was so happy.  About the food... I was just so impressed.  The octopus over german potato salad was unlike anything I've ever had, and just so delicious.  Yes, it does sound strange but it was so well done, and the octopus was cooked just perfectly, it was so tender.  I was so thrilled the chef has decided to include this as one of the courses.  We had a big scallop seared and served over corn salsa which was almost sweet but just delicious.  We also had braised rabbit, which again was tender and also quite flavorful sitting in a pool of broth, with some tomatoes, and homemade pasta.  The rib eye for the main course was flavorful and again very tender.  The cheese course was fun.  And I loved thin very rich slice of chocolate dessert.  To be honest, I was simply amazed at the quality of these dishes.  Sure it is a more expensive dinner out, but for the quality and caliber of the dishes, it is a steal!! This is easily one of my most memorable and favorite dining experiences.  Easily 5 stars for Bacaro!!"}
{"text":"I'm all for the fine dining experience but I agree with other reviewers - the portion sizes for some dishes are comically small. I'm giving it 4 stars with hopes the restaurant will increase portion sizes.... or embrace a tapas style menu with prices to match."}
{"text":"Went here for 1-year anniversary. Over-priced food where 50 and 60 year old townies and professors eat.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend's parents (who were paying!) and we loved it. The service was great and the food was amazing. I just personally could generally not afford to come here as a student."}
{"text":"Food was very good and presentation is excellent.   This is Champaign's version of  a Manhattan bistro."}
{"text":"The steak was excellent .  But I ordered  artichokes for the table and they were scrawny and there were only 2   Not much taste.  I had had them the night before at Radio Maria's and they were delish.  Also the price was way too high for this type of Italian food in downstate Illinois."}
{"text":"Meh. The bread was cold, the bean dip it's served with was cold, the mushroom dish that was described as served over risotto was served over cold orzo. Didn't knock my socks off."}
{"text":"The taste was great for sure; it's clear the chef knows what he's doing. The portions on the other hand... ridiculous. The only way we would've been full was if we spent over $200 or so each.  The service and atmosphere was nice, so if you've got a bunch of money to throw away, and want to lounge somewhere, it's a great place. Otherwise, there are restaurants that offer greater value and dining experience in Chambana.  Like others here, we got PO'ed at the portions and went to another restaurant to fill up right after."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the 7-course tasting menu and the wine pairing. The appetizer and main dishes were absolutely wonderful: Superbly layered flavors and beautiful presentation. I substituted the cucumber gazpacho for course #1 and it was amazing. Also wonderful: The prosciutto and melon, the red snapper, and the steak. The other courses were fair-to-good. The weakest was the White Russian milkshake, which tasted like refrigerator (not so fresh).   The wine pairings ($40 option) were well selected and generously poured. Very generously. I think I'd skip the wine pairing next time and just choose 1-2 glasses myself, but for someone who enjoys a lot of wine, the pairing option would truly enhance the experience."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Champaign-Urbana if you don't mind the price.  Sometimes the dishes \"try too hard\" to be unique and modern; I'm all for molecular gastronomy and modern cuisine (even tried some in my kitchen) but the combination has to work. Chocolate cake and bacon? Not as good as chocolate cake without bacon."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised. Great service, great atmosphere and amazing food! There were some trepidations from my party, as ingredients found at Bacaro were uncommon, but with the server's help we all were very pleased with our orders! Also a great wine selection topped off the evening- also ordered with the staff's assistance. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I can't help but feel this Restaurant has fooled many.   While I've read the food described as \"Authentic Italian,\" I felt it was anything but.  I've been to Italy, and this ISN'T Italian...  I suppose the entire visit was lackluster. The decor had a lot to be desired, but the wait staff were great.   However, once we ordered wine (and, by the old menu at least, were supposed to receive the standard 4oz glass) things went downhill. While we were savoring the tiny portion in our glasses, the bartender was doing his best to overfill the glasses of the pretty girls at the bar. When questioned, we were told \"they asked for doubles.\" Who orders a double Merlot?   We chose what appeared to be a special at the time: a smoked duck panini.   What arrived at the table was a glorified ham and cheese sandwich. No, I'm not complaining about the sandwich itself, but they had substituted ham instead of smoked duck, then claimed that I wouldn't know the difference.   I'm not sure if it was just this visit or the one that followed that biased me, but I'll never return."}
{"text":"Expensive food but quite delicious and well presented. Portions are a bit small, but if you're going with appetizers and dessert the amount of food will leave you full and happy without being too stuffed to leave your chair. The waitress made a great wine selection to go with our food. The restaurant isn't very big, the decor is modern. A good place to go on a date if you're willing to spend the $."}
{"text":"Our favorite date night restaurant in Champaign, though we can't go as often as we'd like since it is a splurge. The staff is always great: knowledgeable (ask them for recommendations and you will not be disappointed), but not stuffy at all. This is a restaurant that could be plopped into downtown Chicago and do well, but does not have downtown Chicago prices. It is on the high end for Champaign, but no more so than many of the other fine dining options and the food here is amazing. If you want a memorable dining experience in Champaign, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"For Champaign, this is the best food around.  I really appreciate what this restaurant is about: good local food presented in a sophisticated yet approachable way.  The Monday arket menu is a great price too.  The staff is not pretentious which is always nice to see.  This is a diamond in the C-U rough."}
{"text":"I am trying to think of what to add that hasn't been said...   I think this is one of the outstanding restaurants in Champaign-Urbana. I have had many meals there, most were superb, but this is reality, and once in a while I have been disappointed, as can be seen in some reviews. Overall, they rock.  This is not the typical \"american-italian\" restaurant. Perhaps it is more helpful to think of the Italian philosophy to place importance on food that is local, fresh, and in-season. As this would indicate, the menu changes frequently.  This is not an all-you-can eat for cheap place. Portions are human-sized, and thus smaller than what we have become used to having to carry out in a bag or leave on the plate. Prices reflect the cost of quality ingredients and a skilled staff.   There's a nice wine list that favors Italian varieties. The staff can make good recommendations.   One more thing that is not well-known - they are now open for lunch Tuesday-Friday.  And why do I compliment highly, acknowledging it is far above others in the region, yet gave 4/5 stars? I have to save a star; there are better restaurants in the world."}
{"text":"1st time here...for an appetizer we had the Burrata - roasted beets, chive, pistachio, beet green pesto, chili oil was. We also had the Peas and Carrots.  Very light and extremely tasty! For the main course, the Smoked Potato Gnocchi was AMAZING and the Wild Striped Bass was very flavorful! The wife enjoyed the bass thoroughly,  but we both agree the smoked potato gnocchi was the winner! Nice atmosphere and friendly staff!  We will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very well prepared food. Exceptional service. The roasted cauliflower is super delicious; my husband doesn't really like cauliflower but loved it.   He had the scallops which were perfectly cooked; they came with \"scalloped\" potatoes (mashed potatoes formed into sea scallop shapes) that were nicely crisped on the outside. I had the duck but I can't remember the sides, so maybe it wasn't so memorable.  They also make their ice creams in-house (as any restaurant of this caliber should).  Highly recommend Bacarro for a nice evening out or when you have guests used to finer dining."}
{"text":"Wine list was very good. Food was excellent. Service was great. Atmosphere was great.  Will go again. I wold recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"We went for the seven course with wine pairing on a weekday night as we found ourselves in Champaign and wanted a nice night out. The food was good for the most part but not spectacular. The final course was the equivalent of an ice cream cake and very anticlimactic. They had rushed us through seven courses and cafe in under 1.5 hours. The place wasn't full so it wasn't to free our table.  They should bring the wine pairings out and pour them in front of you giving you the opportunity to more fully examine the maker. The same could be said about explaining or detailing the origins of the food ingredients, which did indeed seem to be of high quality.   Server was very good, bar tender seemed a little disinterested.  As for price, I paid the same amount a few weeks ago at home in Rome at a well known neighborhood place where the food and wine were superior."}
{"text":"A little bit disappointed about the summer menu. Not many exciting dishes provided. Great service and good environment at least. Nice restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, and I have to say, it's gotten better in the year or two since it opened. Yes, they still pour meager glasses of wine, but the wine menu is great. And yes, the food isn't really *really* Italian, but it's pretty delicious, whatever you think it is. The first time I went, the risotto was mushy, too wet, and way to cheesy. But today, wow. Just ... wow. The ONLY place within 200 miles that serves burrata. Please order the burrata. What an outstanding cheese. My ribeye was also very good, seared and perfectly medium. Tender and fatty. Yum. My girlfriend's ravioli, topped with truffle, were also delicious.  Give them a try. I think especially in a town with very few fancy food options, this is a real treat."}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Saturday not really knowing what to expect. I would agree with other viewers that Bacaro is a fine dining restaurant, nice atmosphere and nice service. Overall, the food was very good, we enjoyed the dishes we tried. However portion sizes were quite small, making it very pricey for what you were served. For 3 of us our bill was over $150 and we did leave with our hunger not satisfied. If the prices correlated more with the portion sizes we would return. But sadly, I don't think we will."}
{"text":"Bacaro is very \"hit or miss\" -- there have been times I have loved my food, and other times where the food has been average (but has been expensive!).  Overall, it is a consistently good restaurant in terms of service.  However, there are certain dishes that are more tasty than others.  I would definitely recommend trying Bacaro at least twice in an attempt to determine the types of dishes you like and don't like."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is, by far the best restaurant in town, and one of the top 5 in the state.  I eat out a lot, and I always look forward to eating here.  I actually had the single best dish I have ever had in my entire life here, and same goes for the best dessert I have ever had. I also like that the menu is never the same twice.  While I do have a favorite dish a some places, I always know that it is going t be an intelligent, pleasing, and not over sized meal.  This is a place that I go to before I go out, and I like that you can eat and function after.  I like the decor.  I have read a few reviews that did not like it, and I do understand them, but I love the Danish modern look.  It was done tastefully, and with some thought. If I have one complaint it would be that when I am there I can't decide what to get.  Small menu, but you end up wanting everything on it.   I lived in Chicago for many years so I had a LOT of great food around me, and I always made a point of going there."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner in February 2011.  Extensive wine list, great service.  Food was not so great.  I had the duck dish for app and monkfish for my entree.  both were too salty. Maybe it was just that day?   Also kids who wail/scream should not come to wine lounges! (the rest of the crowd was fine, just these two kids who sat at the table next to us...)  I would probably go back here but just to try the other wines...and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"another great experience last night at Bacaro. Over the top with wine and interesting food. I did the chefs choice starting with an incredible assortment of meats everything from house cured proscuitto to blood sausage and veal sweetbreads. We moved on to a great salad of raddichio and goat cheese with hazelnuts, a few more really incredible plates-A great atmosphere with friendly and knowledgeable staff"}
{"text":"This restaurant is sort of hit and miss. I have had some really spectacular pasta with sea urchin. And some fairly mediocre short ribs. This is one of the best restaurants in the area but it wouldn't hold up too much competition elsewhere"}
{"text":"I felt decidedly underwhelmed and overcharged.  The chocolate cake was the only item that I consumed that lived up to the expectation or the quality implied by the pricing.  The soup was merely OK and the spaghetti completely underwhelming (bland, in a runny sauce) and a huge disappointment.  I also felt that I was missing a spoon to easier roll the spaghetti in, and I don't really see the point of being given a knife instead.  Finally the Malbec I ordered (by the glass) simply shouldn't be on the menu in a fine dining restaurant.  To complete my negative experience, everything on the menu was 2 to 4 dollars more expensive than the already high prices posted on their \"sample menu\" online.   To be fair, the service was fine (although not extraordinary) but obviously couldn't compensate for the rest."}
{"text":"Winter menu is very expensive and limited that's why I did not list bacaro as 5 stars.   The food was very good but over priced for the market value.  The pork chop came with rib and had good flavor, the seasoning gave the top a nice crisp and crunchy taste and feel.  The pork chop was accompanied by a few small Rosemary potatoes with a mix of arugula and a hint of olive oil.  The lasagna was not a traditional lasagna, this one had a zesty lemon grass sauce which wasn't too bad, but if you're expecting traditional, this one won't be for you.  Over the experience was great lots of wine to choose from and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"What one would consider fine dining - especially considering the fact we're talking about Champaign - Bacaro's boasts of an extensive wine selection and the best of traditional Italian cuisine.  We ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, and, because I wasn't feeling very adventurous, chose the oven roasted chicken as my entre.  Overall, I found both these dishes a little too salty (maybe the chef was just having an off night?).  The portions are modest, but you would probably expect a little more for the price you're paying.  They did have a decent cheesecake and the check came out with a couple yummy chocolate chip meringues, but overall I guess I was a little disappointed.  In consensus with what many others have said, service was very attentive, but I felt it was almost to the point of pretentiousness.  Based on this experience alone, I would most likely not recommend Bacaro's nor dine here again, but I really don't want to dislike this establishment and would like to come back again sometime in the future and give it another chance.  Until then, I say stick with Radio Maria."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Champaign, hands down the best food.  We ordered the tasting menu and were not disappointed.  Seven courses and all were expertly prepared.  Staff was friendly and courteous....  we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The atmosphere is great, but the food is too buttery and overpriced. I went there twice last year. I forget exactly what I ordered, but I definitely remember the food being greasy and overpriced."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the fuss is about. I lived in Chicago for many years so maybe I'm spoiled. I don't mind paying $27 for a steak but the steak I had was average at best and one of my friends had a rabbit dish that was just okay. Third friend had a seafood risotto that was the best of the three entrees. The entree selections were very limited and tried too hard to be different or unusual.  Waiter was nice but new I would guess because he seemed nervous.   Not rushing back any time soon."}
{"text":"7-course tasting menu. MUCH worse than expected. Not strictly following the menu. A lot of substitute items not notified. Overlapping ingredients between courses. Service was ok. I did not feel the warmness and passion from the servers. Wine pairing was great but not generous. I would pay more for a better experience in Chicago. Overall, do not recommend the tasting menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot to go if you want something a little more intimate and quiet. Good spot to bring a date. Menu changes with the seasons. It was a couple weeks ago since I've been. Server was Evan he was awesome, super knowledgable and cool personality. Good food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"My partner and I went here for our anniversary and got the chef's tasting menu + wine pairings. It was probably the best meal I've ever had. Every dish was perfect, and every pairing was perfect. I've never been for a normal dinner off the menu, but I probably will eventually. I'm happy and impressed that a restaurant this nice exists in this little town. One complaint, and not really their fault: A few times now I've walked past to see people in bright orange Illini sweatshirts and other \"lay-on-the-couch\" attire eating dinner. I can't believe someone would go to such a nice place dressed like that! Put on a tie, son! Or at least a button up shirt. Maybe Bacaro should have a dress code."}
{"text":"Just drank some wine there. The bartenders were very nice. The ambiance and atmosphere is very good. Planning to have a dinner or brunch there."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated like garbage at a pretentious overpriced \"whatever\" of a restaurant then go.  My recommendation is avoid because there is way too much attitude here.  We were greeted rudely when they learned we did not have a reservation.... On a freaking Thursday.... In a college town!  We walked out, so thankfully they did not get our money and we had a wonderful meal just two doors away."}
{"text":"Have eaten here MANY times over the years, from when it was just a panini joint to just the other day.  I think this place's most inventive time was its best time, about 3 years ago, maybe a little more.  Food items are less adventurous and price point has increased with time.  That said, the desserts under their pastry chef of the last year or two have been TOPS.  Service I have always found to be very good and knowledgeable, esp. about wine.  I am curious to see how the metamorphosis of the former Persimmon Grocery into a mozzarella bar (is CU ready?)/wine lounge/private dining salon will go."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I've only had dessert here but WOW it is amazing! I've even been here twice just for the desserts, once with my mom, and another time with my bf.  I first tried Bacaro when my mom and I stumbled upon it after a good saturday night dinner at Radio Maria, up the street, when their dessert menu didn't tempt us. At Bacaro we got blown away at how awesome the two desserts were. We tried the chocolate and red wine budino (Italian for pudding) and my personal favorite- the meyer lemon tart with super fresh fruit. Waitress was fast, and courteous. Another plus is they serve french press coffee!  My second dessert trip was also perfect. My bf is the type of guy who never dresses up to go out, and hates places where he cant wear jeans. Somehow i convinced him to put on some khakis and we went on a thursday night like 10pm. He loves chocolate, and hates lemon so he picked the budino and I had the tart again because I knew he wouldnt steal any! They were both perfection. What made our experience even better was how nice our waitress was, and the ambience within the restaurant.  So calming and chill! But according to my bf the highlight of his night was when he requested the bartender play some Radiohead and she happily obliged. (I wrote that there is a dj because im sure they would try to play your request for you if they have it!) The waitstaff all seems super nice, and well-informed about the menu. And the women's bathroom is super cute with real towels, and sweet smelling lotions! I want to try dinner here too but haven't been that adventurous. I'll update if i do!"}
{"text":"yeah... so what, I have only eaten here twice. Like there could be a bad meal from this spot. Staff is awesome, all of them. Front of house, back of house, big props. I have had food that I had never had (black truffle risotto) , and I have had things I have had before (grilled octopus and pork cheeks!) presentation, quantity, ambiance, vibe, wine, champagne. This is a comfortable yummy spot. When I get my duck in order, I will eat out a bit more often, and well... I can't wait. done shun"}
{"text":"There are not a lot of really nice dinning restaurants in Champaign.  The menu is seasonal and changes at least 4 times per year.  All made fresh, nothing frozen.  I would like to see more variety."}
{"text":"I ordered Duck and my boyfriend ordered the beef fillet. They were both very good. We also shared an appetizer, octopus salad. Service was awesome.  I made reservation in the morning. And it was full at dinner time.   Perfect restaurant for dates."}
{"text":"Best chef, wait staff and ambience in town, topped off by a menu with ample flexibility."}
{"text":"We tried the seven courses tasting menu here on our anniversary day and were very disappointed. The first three dishes were almost made with the same thing and tasted very plain. Main dish was fried chicken and neither juicy nor tasty at all! Bread were burnt too much. The only thing we like is just the chocolate cake dessert but nothing special. Not worth for the price! Won't come back for sure"}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend here on our first date, and I could not have asked for a better experience. Food was excellent and the atmosphere was very warm and pleasant. Portions were reasonable, but not huge. Wine is half price on Sundays by the way! Definitely a great dinner date location."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to stop in after a long day of visiting family and friends. Not too noisy,  good food, and any beverage you like. We didn't  order entrees just appetizers and salad. They still sent out an Amuse-Bouche and sliced baguette  with olive oil. Nice. We wish we would have been  hungry enough for a full dinner but we had been  eating all day long. Next time I think I will budget  my stomach space and leave some room for Bacaro.  You should too."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that I'd pick a place in Champaign for my 600th review!... Well, Bacaro certainly deserves it: I finally went there for dinner last night (after wanting to go for several months), and I was wowed. I'm still salivating thinking about it.  I went there with pretty high expectations (I'd heard great things about it from several friends and coworkers): that's usually not a good thing as it makes it easier to be disappointed, but Bacaro did not disappoint. In fact, I'm happy to say that my dinner there was on a par with my best dining experiences in NYC.  First and foremost: the food. My boyfriend and I decided to share a bunch of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the fresh mozzarella with heirloom tomatoes and pesto, as well as the roasted suckling pig with homemade sauerkraut: they were both absolutely delicious (don't miss the suckling pig!). We then shared one entree: we got the braised pork shank, which came with sauteed spinach, mushrooms, bacon, and fig sauce: soooo good! The portions are not huge, but two appetizers and one entree turned out to be enough food. For dessert, we got the panna cotta with fresh fruit: simple but just as outstanding. That was some seriously great food!!  As Bacaro is also a wine lounge, their wine selection is quite extensive. We got a sampler of three wines by the glass for $14, all of which were pretty good. Not to forget the 10yo port we got with our dessert (very generous pour...), which was good also.  Service was great, ambiance was great (although it's a shame that the place was so empty)... it was really a great dinner (sure, it was not cheap, but entirely worth it!). By far the restaurant in Champaign, in my opinion. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed our dinner at Bacaro for my fiancé's birthday. Both of us did the tasting menu with the wine pairings. Each course was very creatively designed and tasteful with excellent wine pairings. Two of our favorites were the black truffle risotto and the filet with butternut squash and chili butter. Our server, Paige, was very sweet and kind, and also very knowledgeable of the menu and wine. Thank you for helping us celebrate, as well as for exceptional service! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Menu is comprehensive. Atmosphere intimate and quiet. Service pleasant."}
{"text":"Bacaro serves refined, restrained, beautiful, absolutely delicious food. If you are looking for fine dining in Champaign, this is the place to go. I've never eaten anything there I didn't love, the servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and something about the atmosphere is soothing.  Thad Morrow is an asset to Champaign and this is a restaurant to be appreciated. I love the way they use their produce here and tend to gravitate toward the vegetable dishes. The staff definitely makes the effort to work with local, quality and seasonal ingredients when possible, and it pays off. The flavors are bright and fresh, and Bacaro completely honors the quality ingredients it sources. What more can you ask for in a restaurant?   The prix fixe Market Monday menus are always a treat. And when I can't splurge on a full dinner, I enjoy popping in to sit at the bar with a glass of wine and a small plate. I can't even name the Bacaro dishes I have enjoyed the most--everything I have eaten here, from the soups to the salads to the pastas to the entrees, has been a pure pleasure. The kind of food that makes you say \"ohhhh god\" after every bite. For Central Illinois it may be a splurge, but I'm telling you, eating here is worth 100 meals at Destihl or Radio Maria or Seven Saints or Guido's or any of those other totally mediocre downtown restaurants.  Bacaro also seems unpretentious. It's definitely upscale, but I feel completely comfortable going in there in jeans and moccasins and unbrushed hair. (...Or maybe I'm just an oblivious slob.) Oh, and maybe this is irrelevant for a restaurant review, but I have to mention that once I was there the night a guy proposed to his girlfriend, and the restaurant sent out glasses of champagne to every customer in there. You also get amuse bouches before dinner and little homemade dessert bites with your check. I love touches like that.  My one complaint is that it's harder than it used to be to get a good boozy cocktail here. There used to be some talented cocktail guys behind the bar. Recently I went in and ordered a Manhattan,  a totally standard cocktail, and the bartender had to look up the recipe in a book. So I stick to wine and resign myself to the fact that you really can't get a great whiskey cocktail anywhere in Champaign-Urbana.  For me the ultimate test is: If this restaurant were in Chicago, a city full of fine dining spots, how would I rate it? Without hesitation, Bacaro would get five stars."}
{"text":"A wonderful place to take a date. Romantic, quiet, and a wonderful wine selection. Over the weekend I took a date here for dinner. We both had the filet. It was wonderful!  Cooked to perfection, and melted in our mouths. Not to mention, we washed it down with a great Cabernet. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys an upscale experience."}
{"text":"My date secured us a reservation here for Valentines Day.  Pretentious. Server was snooty, bar man was snooty. The patrons also the same. Crammed seating.  It was crazy expensive, I understand local farm products, different menus, blah blah blah..but in Central Illinois? Seriously, $28 for a chicken leg? No thank you.   The prices were a turnoff and the food was OK, maybe we picked the wrong dishes.   The whole time my date and I were staring at this couple that did the at the time $98/person tasting menu...one YOUNG lady and a very old man... and they were a riot so I guess we had fun watching them. Other then that, Meh."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here the week after our wedding to treat ourselves to a nice meal.  The food was incredibly good.  The servers and bartenders were knowledgeable and attentive.  We were there on a Monday so we were able to enjoy the Market Monday tasting menu, and I have to say, each dish was delicious.  Each dish was seasonal and had a great blend of flavors; I couldn't pick a dish that I didn't like.  We opted for the wine pairing and each wine matched the dish it was served with very well.  Wine has been a hobby of mine for a number of years but my wife is just getting into it, and she was blown away by the taste difference the pairings made.  I think the reviews stating that this restaurant was 'snooty' or that the service was slow are from people who don't truly understand what this restaurant is.  We spent 2 hours eating our 5 course meal.  It's a place where dining is an experience.  Come here expecting that, and come hungry.  Any complaints about small portion sizes must be coming from people ordering a la carte.  We'll be back the next time we want to have a fancy date night, without question."}
{"text":"Bacaro has been through some subtle but incredibly effective changes. I am happy to say it has taken back it's rightful spot as both my favorite and simply the best restaurant in town... and one of the my favorite spots anywhere. As I mentioned previously the decor and staff are superb, but Chef Thad Morrow is now to be seen frequently in the dining room, and is doing a much better job of maintaining food standards than than the previous Maitre D'. Food is now flawless, and portion sizes have increased somewhat too, which for most was a welcome change. There is also a new Bar snack menu, which combines comfort-food with nouveau twists, like spicy homemade pork crackling! Bacaro could compete on a world stage, and do very well."}
{"text":"Whether you are interested in local, organic ingredients or simply enjoy delicious food, Bacaro will not disappoint.  5 of us had a fantastic time at this restaurant last night.  We shared a couple of appetizers and entrees and everyone loved every dish we had.  The resounding favorite was the octopus appetizer which was tender and flavor- full.   The beef tenderloin was charred nicely on the exterior and was cooked to a perfect pink.  The seared scallops with Myers Lemon were refreshing and light.  The gnocci was a showstopper as was the risotto with black truffles and the duck breast.  We asked Thad, the chef, to choose a bottle of wine based on our menu selections which enhanced the experience!  The entrees run between $25-$32 and makes a great choice for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal at Bacaro, but I have a hard time justifying the price.  On the whole, the food was very good, but the overall experience fell short of my expectations for other dinners of similar quality that I have had elsewhere.     First, the atmosphere of the restaurant, while nice, did not strike me as anything special.  That said, this could be a product of where I sat.   Even though I placed a reservation close to a week in advance, I found myself sitting at the table nearest to the kitchen with my date.  While she had a view of downtown Champaign and the restaurant's interior, my own view was of a row of temperature controlled wine racks and a junky-looking electrical socket near the kitchen's entrance.       For the appetizer, we had the pizzetta, which didn't strike me as anything special:  just bread, cheese, grape tomatoes, onion, and bacon.   Our entrees-- the braised rabbit and the grouper-- were better, but as others have mentioned, the portions were quite small, even for a restaurant focused on contemporary fine-dining.  Thanks to a bottle of wine and a second helping of bread, nobody left hungry, but with the final bill clocking in at close to $120, it was hard not to walk away with a sense that some of that money could be better spent elsewhere.           Ultimately, in giving Bacaro three stars, I am rating it in the context of other \"fine-dining\" establishments.  The restaurant's chefs clearly know how to cook, and their wait staff is very well trained, but I don't think that either the food nor the space warrants the price that they have set on it."}
{"text":"Overcooked fish and tough steak at fine dining prices.  I went two weeks ago with one dining companion.  I like to wait a couple of weeks before writing a review so I can see what was truly memorable about a place.    Overall the food was just ok, and for $150 (not incl. tip and wine) that makes for very bad value.  We wanted to taste a variety of things, so my companion and I wanted to order one tasting menu, and a few other dishes, and share everything.  We were told that if one person orders the tasting menu, everyone at the table has to order the tasting menu, no matter how many people are in the party, so that the kitchen could get the timing of the plates right.  For us this made no sense.  Since we were going to share everything anyway, the timing was irrelevant.  But no, we had to follow the rule, so we both ordered the tasting menu.  The first course was a cold soup.  It was decent, but uninspiring.  Although I have an excellent memory for food, I honestly don't even remember what was in this soup, which should tell you something.  The second course was a sea scallop grilled over cherry wood.  It was absolutely delicious.  This was the best dish of that night.  The third course was basically Roman-style spaghetti carbonara with pork jowl instead of belly bacon, and a few yellow peppers and tomatoes thrown in.  While it was very tasty, the truth is that it's a dish that's not hard to make.  I would compare it to getting a really good hamburger.  It's delicious, sure, but when you get it at a fine dining restaurant at $$$ prices, it's just not right.  The third course was grilled sea bass with sauteed Spanish chorizo and vegetables.  The fish was way overcooked, so it was dried out and unpleasant, and the flavor was annihilated by the strong chorizo.  The fourth course was steak.  It was allegedly a ribeye, but apparently they kept the delicious rib cap for themselves, because it was lean and tough.  Part of the problem was undoubtedly that they cooked it well done.  They never even asked us how we wanted it cooked (they probably have some rule about that too).  This steak course was just unforgivable.  I don't even want to think about it anymore.  The fifth course was a small slice of local goat brie and a berry compote.  It was good, but again not really special.  The sixth course was a beet/lemon mousse.  This was pretty good.  It was not overly sweet, which we liked.  Although it seemed like a neat idea, in practice the beet mousse did not have any beet flavor at all.  It was just sweet.  The lemon mousse was better though.  So overall we got two sea scallops, some good spaghetti, and some lemon mousse.  For $150.  Ridiculous.  Maybe the other reviewers are correct that this place can be amazing, and it's just inconsistent.  We'll never know, because why take a gamble at this sort of place?  If I'm paying fine dining prices, I expect consistently excellent food, and Bacaro clearly does not have it."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Champaign.  Service is great and very friendly (apart from one server we had last fall who has, thankfully, seemed to have left).  Food ranges from very good to amazing.  We've never had a bad meal at bacaro.  You can throw down a lot of money here, but you don't need to.  The bar is great, they have reasonable and interesting wines by the glass, and you can have a few appetizers or smaller courses and leave without spending too much and but still feeling like you had a special night out.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Rotating menu with wine recommendations. Large wine selection. Professional staff. Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This review is extra late. I came here with my friend when he was visiting from San Francisco. We came the Monday before Thanksgiving and had a reservation, although they were not busy. We had their Market Monday menu since it was Monday. It had a very Thanksgiving theme to it, but my favorite was the beet salad.   We also had wine pairings with each course and they were all pretty good, except for perhaps one of the wines. I don't remember which wine it was since this was so long ago.   Overall, a nice, quiet dining experience."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find this place and was not disappointed. Very good food and service meant for a great time. Will definitely go back when in Champaign again."}
{"text":"I always love Bacaro!  This was actually my second time here and it was such a nice evening in Champaign, that our party of 4 asked to sit outside even though our original reservation was for the inside and the staff was very accommodating.  The wine is half price on Sundays so I had 3 glasses. The Pinot Noir was delightful and the Cab Sauv was decent as well.  With wine, we had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses and plenty of bread.  For dinner, the risotto with rabbit was tasty.  Dessert was a red velvet ice cream cake.  It was okay.  Bacaro used to have a panna cotta that was memorable to the point where, it was the one item I truly wanted to have again when returning to this spot.  Oh well, maybe next time.  Overall, a great spot for good food and drink."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here last weekend, and, my god, it was amazing. We decided in the tasting menu and each got the wine pairing. There were seven courses on the tasting menu, including a dessert. They were small portions, but I was almost full by course 5, and completely full at the end, so there was plenty of food. It was pretty expensive, but we knew what we were getting into, so the over $300 bill didn't surprise us. The atmosphere was great. I was surprised to find this gem in CU."}
{"text":"Nice, elegant, cozy place to dine.  Nice menu with a good mix of local farm products (veggies) and very fresh menu.  The food was a little salty but very original and tasty.   Service was a tad slow and not timed well but it was very busy.  Service is the only reason it was rated a 3 but the food is a 4."}
{"text":"Good place for dates. The atmosphere is good and the service is excellent. I would say this is my favorite place in Champaign after being here for five years."}
{"text":"We ate there on a whim a while back.  We walked bye and the place was empty.  So we decided to give it a try rather than our initial option.  Staff was very snooty to us because didn't have reservstions.  At first they said they were booked.  Again, the place was completley empty.  Two tables total seated eating.  After 2 people  and much talking they sat us.  price was very high.  food was average.  service was extremely slow.  The place never got more than half full.  Not sure what they consider booked.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Hmmm, what to say, what to say.  I came here for dinner the other Sunday night, place was quiet but very nice in terms ambiance.  The menu was very nice.  The service was excellent.  The food would have been good, even excellent except the chef was very heavy with the salt, every dish was salty, excessively so.  Not enough to send it back but one more grain of salt and I would have refused to eat it.  My companion suffered the same fate.    The wine list was either very expensive, they did not have it or Slovenian, not sure what's up with that.  We ended up drinking beer because we could not find anything we liked.  I'd give the place one more try just to see if perhaps this was an off night.  To the other raves comparing this place to the top restaurants in NY or Chicago I would say \"oh please\"!  It was good, showed promise of things possibly greater but comparing it to a dozen places I could name off the top of my head in either city Bacaro was good but at these prices it should have been better."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  I've been wanting to go to Bacaro for awhile, but my husband and I have been too busy.  We finally made time last night.  Atmosphere: 5 stars.  Great atmosphere, dimly lit, very nice.  Service: 5 stars... we found the service to be extremely high caliber without being  snooty.  We ate at NOMI in Chicago a few weeks ago and the service was comparable.  Quality and Kind... just the kind of service we adore.  Food: PERFECT.  I'm not a \"foody\" but I adore good food.  The octopus was the best I've ever had.  The gnocchi was incredibly savory.  My husband tried the steak and I had the lamb special.  Both were FANTASTIC.    Wine suggestion: 4.5 Stars.  Wine was good, not great.  I'm not sure if we failed to describe what we wanted.  Would be nice to have some descriptions in the wine menu.  We've been to several nice restaurants in Chicago that provided descriptions of at least a subset of wine choices.  This is such a minor point though.  We did not eat dessert as we were stuffed.  I can't say enough good things about this very very special restaurant.  I'm just disappointed we took so long to finally get around to eating there.  We will be back... this is now my favorite restaurant in Champaign Urbana!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Champaign-Urbana. A little pricey, but worth every penny. Incredible wine selection and a staff that loves to help you find that perfect food and wine pairing."}
{"text":"Tranquil, calm and romantic Wine bar is pretty decent and deserts taste good."}
{"text":"We ordered spaghetti and meatballs. The \"pasta\" looked and tasted *exactly* like ramen. Straight up ramen. We were dumbfounded."}
{"text":"I will be upfront by saying that I have actually not dined yet at Bacaro (although it can highly recommended by several palettes I trust)... the reason for my 5 stars was that this place went above and beyond in their customer service. My group of 12 had a reservation there, but they experienced a utility issue and had to close. The owner Drew quickly made arrangements for us at another location and stayed in contact to make sure we were taken care of for the night. I cannot wait to get back to dine at Bacaro and fully validate the 5 star review! Cheers, and thank you again!"}
{"text":"Haha, came to review this place and realized I reviewed it four years ago, when I ate the admittedly boring student prix-fixe. Hopefully they don't do that anymore. Since then I move to Stockholm and then New York City. I was back in the area for a few days and decided to try Bacaro again. It was really very good. Yes, despite the fact that there is a lot of mediocre food in the area, it's not the area's fault. Champaign-Urbana has fantastic terroir. There are many producers nearby making food that is world-class and Bacaro uses these ingredients to great effect. I LOVED the goat cheese salad and my rich creamy risotto. Fried sweetbreads were luscious. My boyfriend's chicken with chicken liver was delicious.   I guess the only complaint is that the prices here are the same as in NYC..."}
{"text":"This place was top notch. Tried a couple of the \"interesting \" wines as well as a lovely Italian. Service was attentive and quick. Food was excellent and presented well. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I really liked Phils dish better than my own but the ambiance and the service was excellent, now off to The Molly!!! :)"}
{"text":"I can't complain about the prices.  The food was expensive; the food was good.  There was presentation to the entire experience, which is something I've found a little lacking since moving to Champaign. I wouldn't want to eat in the bar area on a Saturday night, and if the hostess hadn't been able to move us into the other room we would have had to leave.  My dad can't hear very well and his hearing is better than my lip reading.  The bar area is really nice and I'd love to eat there on a Tuesday, which I have. The good:  The food.  Three people, three different dishes, and everybody liked theirs.  I had the halibut and mom had the rabbit, and if you're going in there soon, I'd recommend either, and even more I'd recommend the vichyssoise with crab and asparagus.  If you're hardline vegetarian (I eat fish) then you'll have problems with the menu, but I believe the waitress at least implied that the chef would make allowances/prepare something else?  Either way you should call ahead and see.  I have no complaints about oversalting like other reviewers, perhaps they listened?  The malbec we drank with dinner was a nice random choice. The bad:  Our waitress was new.  At least I hope she was new.  The service was great but she wasn't as familiar with the menu or wine list as someone working at that caliber of restaurant should be. The manhattans were terrible.  I suspect Bacaro of being yet another restaurant who thinks they should have their own special manhattan, with exotic bitters and cherry juice and... do you think you're going to save me from scurvy or something?  I want bourbon, bitters, and sweet vermouth, and go easy on everything but the bourbon.  This is no time for creativity. The dessert menu is stupid.  Who follows octopus and rabbit with banana bread and ice cream?  Hire a dessert chef. I would totally recommend Bacaro if you need \"fancy dinner out.\" Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I have parents who need impressing."}
{"text":"First off, the chef's mortadella and creme fraiche didn't amuse my bouche. Second, my gnocchi tasted like it came out of a Bertolli bag in the frozen section at a supermarket and the sauce was inundated with salt. After trying some parmesan, which was freshly grated (about the only positive), and pepper flakes, I realized that nothing could save the dish. If you want to pay Chicago prices to impress a date, you can try Bocaro, but don't expect more than oversalted Champaign food."}
{"text":"Decent food, but not spectacular. The grilled watermelon salad sounded better than it actually was -- it was drenched with vinaigrette...  Anyway, I had the scallop dish, which was cooked nicely... but slightly bland.    I think the wine here is better. had a really awesome special pinot grigio with literally peaches floating around!!! It was so great. I have to come back here  to try more of their wines. I think it's probably better to come here just for wine than for dinner  And like what everyone else said, the service was great!"}
{"text":"I surprised my girlfriend (from northern Italy) on her birthday with dinner at Bacaro. The atmosphere is very nice and sophisticated. We were promptly seated (we had reservations) at a beautifully set table right by the window.   For starters I ordered a negroni and she had a glass of white wine. We then ordered our meal: pizzetta with zucchini and burrata as our antipasto, bucatini and fusili as our primi, and salmon and scallops as our secondi.   The appetizer was a little underwhelming, not enough burrata in my opinion. The first plates were very, very good and reminded us both of Italy. There was however, one issue: my girlfriend's plate of fusili came with a hair on it. We told the waitress and she immediately took care of it and was extremely apologetic - very professionally handled.    Our second plates were even better than the first. The salmon and scallops were cooked to perfection and left us both wanting more.  We finished the night with a caffè corretto (on the house). They also gave my girlfriend a birthday present of chocolate dipped biscotti which was very thoughtful and a nice finishing touch to a wonderful night.  The unfortunate fact that we got a hair on one of our plates and I am still leaving a 5 star review should speak volumes about this restaurant's quality of food and service."}
{"text":"For the price that this Central Illinois establishment charges, one would expect basic restaurant treatment.  I waited for 15 minutes even though I had a reservation.  The host was a snooty, inconsiderate person to which I told him, \"relax, this is Central Illinois, there's nothing to be snooty about.\" And most importantly, the food was over priced, did not taste good and the portions were small.  All in all, not the greatest."}
{"text":"I am from Dallas and in Champaign for business.  I looked at Yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and Bacaro seemed to be the place to go.  I thought it was great.  Unique tasty dishes!"}
{"text":"The food, service, and atmosphere were excellent.  Upscale dining for Champaign-Urbana area. Pricey, but worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I liked the experience at Bacaro.  The menu featured interesting foods and preparations, the service was excellent, and the wine list was good.  Coming from Chicago, I'm spoiled with the level of cuisine we can experience on a regular basis.  Although this restaurant wasn't quite on the level of Chicago, it was very, very good!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but did not have a great experience with waitress. Table of 8, we all ordered tasting menu with wine pairings.  Wine came out about 10 min after our food on a few courses which left us unable to experience the \"pairing\" as you should. We politely and discreetly asked her to bring wine out with or right before food and I think that ticked her  off. After that, she was aloof, barely explained the wine or the dishes we were being served. Water was slow to be refilled. The real kicker was the 20% automatic gratuity she added after tax on our bill! When we asked to speak to the manager, she told us \" he's busy dining with a client\". Say what??? I believe your customers are your priority! We asked a different waiter to see if he could find the manager and low and behold, out he came!  Tainted our experience and maybe our waitress was just having a bad day but when you are dropping that kind of money on dinner- you had better train your wait staff on how to properly serve and deal with customers.  It was a shame because from the chef end- he did a great job of making delicious and interesting food- it's just too bad no one explained it well or delivered it professionally.  Just wanted to post an update. We received a very kind letter from owner/ manager apologizing for our experience and gave us a generous gift certificate to try them again.  We definitely will give them another chance. Again- the food is amazing and we want to see them succeed."}
{"text":"Just a perfect dinning experience. We had two pasta dishes off the menu. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the flavors were excellent. The starter was the celery soup, which was also excelent. We paired it with a reasonably priced Chianti wine. Overall one of the best dinning experiences I have in recent memory. The only small blemish on the eveing was we were sitting at the bar for dinner and one of the bartenders grabbed that delicious celery soup from us before we were finished, would have loved to had that last spoonful."}
{"text":"My daughter took me here for Mother's weekend and it was an amazing experience.  I consider this restaurant to be the best of the Champaign area and want to go back the next time I visit U of I.  The service was attentive and the recommended Pinot Noir was perfect,.  We completely indulged in the delicious food offerings and got take home for my daughter who has to endure school food on a regular basis.  Be sure to check this restaurant out!"}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time at Bacaro.  Waitress (Daisy) did a great job but assumed that because we had not eaten at Bacaro before we wouldn't know what a \"tasting menu\" was about (not necessarily her fault - could be the result of patrons she deals with in this neck of the woods). We ordered the Roasted Beets and Scallops Mousseline for starters and the Sturgeon and Yellow Fin for dinner.  The tuna was really good and the sturgeon was excellent till the penultimate bite, when I ran in to a big chunk of salt.  That eliminated the last bite.  We did order a bottle of Pinot Noir and that was good as was the flour-less chocolate cake.  As for the appetizers, the scallops were really good; the beets were okay - didn't really taste anything but the beets; the truffle beet chips did taste good.  There was some confusion about our reservation but I think the confusion involved a new staff member.  Service (Daisy) was excellent.  It would be nice to experience the taste of some of the other ingredient in every dish coming through."}
{"text":"My only complaint was the waitress was a complete moron.   I am very forgiving of servers too, being a former one myself. She had no idea what was good on the menu and just kept saying \"Im a vegetarian.\" With that being said, in Champaign, I haven't had a better meal. I had the veal and it was wonderful. I can't recall much else but in a town without much choices other than the usual college fare, this ranks up there."}
{"text":"This place is one of our favorite places to eat!  The service is always spot on, the waitresses are always so knowledgeable about the food and extensive wine list!  We first started going here five years ago and we have the most amazing oatmeal cream pie with sea salt.  My husband remember how much I enjoy that dessert and called them and asked if they would make that dessert for my birthday.  It was so thoughtful and sweet!  It is hard to find a restaurant that cares this much about it customers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The food comes slow on purpose. Abandon any thought of 1 hour meal. We were there 2.5 hours. It was awesome. The proportions aren't \"Central Illinois\" they are regular heathy proportions.  Slow down and enjoy the experience. I had the best soup I've ever tasted. Bring your rich relatives or boss who will pay. Expensive."}
{"text":"Full confession. I have never been here for dinner, which is the main draw if this restaurant. I went on a Friday afternoon, when they simply have one item for a little lunch special. Well, sweet Jesus it was awesome! This particular day was the Ciabatta bread sandwich with fresh mozzarella, real garden tomatoes, pesto, and cucumber salad for side. $12 including a drink. So good! Get over there and give it a try."}
{"text":"After finding out our NYE reservations at another restaurant were botched on NYE (read my V. Picasso review), we went to our tried and true favorite; Bacaro. The staff was able to fit us in with zero notice on NYE (and they were obviously bus)y, and my wife and I were grateful.   As always, our dinning experience was phenomenal, as was the staff. We also enjoyed some wonderful drinks and ran into old friends.   Thank you Bacaro for setting the bar for fine dining in CU."}
{"text":"Second trip to Bacaro.  Prix fixe dinner for two with the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu.  $145  We left hungry, and shaking our heads.  Walked across the street to Esquire and had dinner again.  When McDonalds could have profitably sold me 145 hot hamburgers, don't let me actually leave hungry."}
{"text":"Upscale but relaxing and inviting environment. Visited on a Wednesday night around 7:30pm and the place was fairly dead. We were seated right away.  Started with caprese salad, which was a refreshing choice. Ordered a French 75, which had the right proportion of prosecco. I opted for the shrimp linguine and am happy I did. Perfect portion size so you don't overindulge and I was actually able to finish it.   Prices are fairly steep, especially for Champaign, but the quality is worth it. I'm sure this would be an excellent weekend date night spot."}
{"text":"Very expensive and not particularly large dishes.  If you're okay with this first statement, this place is a great place.  The food is really good and the interior is very stylish.  Also, the service is great.  This is a very professional place that you wouldn't expect to see in Champaign."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Beautiful ambience, beautiful waitress, beautiful food. Perfect amounts. Attentive. Just perfect."}
{"text":"Bacaro is one of the nicest restaurants in CU. I can honestly say I've never had better service than I did when my husband and I went here for our anniversary. Our waiter was extremely wine savvy (and I expect a sommelier in training at the very least), and brought out complimentary champagne when he learned it was our anniversary. So for the service, I give it 5 glowing stars.  Now for the food. I got the mushroom soup as my starter, and I can honestly say I've rarely had more disappointing soup in my life. It was loaded with sodium and void of any complexity. I couldn't finish it.  For my main dish, I ordered the vegetarian gnocchi - which was just okay, but presented in this odd little casserole dish that just did not fit the ambiance of a place like Bacaro.   For the price and quality of the food, I would not return. And that's a shame, because the service was some of the best I've ever received."}
{"text":"I'll confess that after nine years I never took the time to sit down in Bacaro for a meal before last night.  I always preferred Radio Maria, Escobar or some other place for a nice meal. So before we set out on a Friday night for Bacaro, I decided to Yelp it and I was (and still am) very suspicious of a few of the reviews.    Here was a place with lots of 1 & 2 star reviews and yet a couple of 5 star reviews, written in great length and gushing detail by Yelpers for whom this was their only review.  So who writes their first and only review in great length and never mentions anything they ordered, just summarizing it as an excellent restaurant, then never subsequently reviews any other restaurant?  I may be a cynic, but it raises red flags....  So, we set off to do our own independent research:  Three people on a Friday night.  The place is full, we get one of a couple of available tables, with no reservations.  The waitress was wonderful.  My first requirement to enjoy a restaurant experience is good service, and she was great.  She knew the menu, she was unequivocal when we asked her what she liked.  She kept her distance and watched us for cues, never interrupting a conversation and never rushing us nor ever making us wait.  The wine list is huge, the drink list is equally huge, but both are very pricey by Champaign standards. My wife's martini was a very full glass, all the way up to the \"c\" section as we Assembly Hall fans would say.  We had a risotto special with fish \"for the table\", one mixed green salad, and one fried pork belly starter.  The pork belly was $10 and was the size of a large marshmallow in the center of a 12 inch plate, humorous by its dinkyness. But good, like a chunk of fried bacon fat. Then we had three entrees, all were very good.  Mine was the grouper ($28) and frankly I don't recall my companion's meals because we also knocked down one martini and two bottles of Cote D' Rhone between the three of us.  The Cote D' Rhone was $28/bottle and the lowest price wine on the list.  Several other wines could be had in the high $30's, and then the rest of the list was north of $40. One apple pie ala mode later and the three of us were out of there for $192 before tip; and she was worth the $40 tip we left, so by the end of the day it approached $77 per person. So if you start a Yelp review at a three, this place gets one more star for having a great server, one star for being in DT Champaign and being beautiful inside & out, including cloth hand towels in the loo.  Then I'll knock one star off for being too pricey for the market, but if Yelp allowed half-stars I'd give Bacaro 4.5."}
{"text":"I rather enjoyed Bacaro.  It had a really nice atmosphere, quality food, and good wine.  I was impressed that time was taken to talk to my wife and I to find a wine to pair with both of our meals.  The pairing was correct and the wine went well with our meals.  It was somewhat amazing also the fact that it wasn't a very expensive wine that was suggested.  This is a very good place to eat in the Champaign area.  The reason I gave it 5/5 (instead of 4/5) is because even though the food is a little over priced in my mind, the service, atmosphere, and location lend to it receiving a 5/5."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best restaurant in Champaign right now.  I go frequently and will continue to go.  The food is consistently good, the service is consistently good and the atmosphere is very pleasant.  Way to go Bacaro!"}
{"text":"The menu was confusing, but overall the food was excellent.  My only complaint with Bacaro is the service.  Our waitress was attentive, but a complete airhead.  She couldn't effectively answer questions, and constantly interrupted conversation by rearranging items on the table."}
{"text":"All the entrees I've tried have been amazing. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. The chef knows what he/she is doing.  It's a bit pricey but well justified because the service is as good as the food."}
{"text":"Based strictly on the menu I was really hoping for a great dinner. However, I was really disappointed with the our dinner. We didn't go for the menu tasting but instead we ordered a couple of entrees. My wife had the chicken and I had the ribeye. Both were cooked very nicely and the unique ingredients made the meals slightly different, but for the prices they charge the taste of each was really just average. My steak wasn't very tender or all that flavorful. Her chicken was cooked decently enough but again the flavor was really just average. I thought maybe because we were there on the Sunday before Labor Day, that maybe it was an off night. But I just couldn't get past the fact that when a place must such a high price on their menu, there really shouldn't be such a thing as an \"Off Night\". The atmosphere and the waiter we had were very nice. So here is my take.  Wait staff 3-4 stars Atmosphere 4-5 stars Wine list 4-5 Stars Beer list 3-4 stars Menu 4-5 stars  Food 2-3 stars  I probably wouldn't go here again just because its priced to high to take a chance on a very average meal. There are a lot of places near by that you get exactly hat you pay for. Unfortunately Bacaro is not one of those places."}
{"text":"I only gave it five stars because I can only give five stars. I was in town for 24 hours, it probably will not return to Champaign again. I wish I could take this restaurant with me on the road. It was a pleasure to have this restaurant available in the middle of Illinois. The scallops and pork were delicious. The grilled octopus salad is a must. Portions are not huge, but adequate. In my party, one person have the ribeye. It was fantastic. The other person had the grilled salmon and it was equally good. All in all this restaurant must not be missed."}
{"text":"Bacaro (pronounced bah-kah-roh') is a trendy little ultra-modern wine bar.  The food is largely excellent, though portions are modest.  Bartenders and waiters are generally quite knowledgable about the huge selection of wines they have, which is a great plus.  And prices are rather reasonable, though not great.  Perching yourself at the bar for half-off wine and some dessert on Sunday night is a great way to enjoy the ambiance of this hip little place."}
{"text":"One of the few places in Champaign to test your palette.  next to cafe luna,  i would say this is the perfect place to escape for excellent wine, food, and dessert.  Thad is serious about his menu and you feel it when you experience his creations.  Libby always recommends the absolute perfect wine for every course...don't even bother trying to compete with her pairing knowledge.  The food is rather smart and inventive.  the interior is very reminiscent of blackbird in chicago."}
{"text":"I've had my second experience at this C-U gem and so far we are 2 for 2. Another comfortable street side table was provided for my daughter and I. A terrific wine by the glass accompanied our appetizer of flat bread with chorizo and cheese. She had a medallion if beef and I had scallops, cockles and"}
{"text":"This is a very very nice little gourmet restaurant that serves very good food at a little bit of a high price. The service was good and my friends and I did have a great time; I guess it could just be a little warmer for the tab. I would definitely get the Lamb Porchetta again and the Panna Cotta for sure."}
{"text":"The wine menu was large and the waiter was very attentive. The only issue was that the waiter used the exact same phrases with all of the table around us, so it seemed ungenuine.   I ordered a very good glass of Riesling. Which, wines are pricy, but it was probably about 4 oz for $7. Which is pricewise on the high side. They brought bread to our table with olive oil. The bread was very fresh and the oil was high grade.   My husband ordered house made gnocchi that came with pork. I ordered a ravioli stuffed with bacon and several fresh vegetables. Both meals were very good, but on the small side for $17 each. We didn't order dessert, as we aren't dessert people.  It was a good dinner, the ambiance was nice and we were seated at a table near the windows in the front.   I just am not super impressed with the portions or the prices."}
{"text":"High end restaurants like this are rarely a problem for getting a true GF meal and this was no exception.  We went for a market Monday tasting menu meal with wine pairings. We were worried as the first two courses came out because they were a bit small but each one got larger and more delicious. It was about a 2-hour event to get through the whole meal but we got to try so many different things (the theme of the night was wild bore) and even though some weren't our top choice, I really loved the set up of the tasting menu and the wines were a lovely addition!"}
{"text":"I had a lovely anniversary dinner here a few years back. I remember the pumpkin ravioli being delicious and the waiter service being great. Portions are relatively small, though.  I love that they use local ingredients and keep their menu small and creative. They are very active on FB as well, so follow them if you are interested in seeing their weekly specials in photo form. Because of the prices, we didn't go back, but if we made more money, we'd definitely have gone back at least a few more times!"}
{"text":"Wonderful combinations of local ingredients; menu evolves with availability. Quiet, stylish, atmopshere. Sunday  1/2 price wine by the glass is a great deal. You won't regret going to Bacaro. This place would do well in Chicago or any other \"foodie\" city."}
{"text":"Third time the charm.  Went again since everything in this city was closed by 10 pm and we had a late dinner.  Three and a half stars to average all my experiences out.  Great red wine from Italy.  Had the sweet potato gnocchi with uni sauce.. don't taste much of the uni but definitely the gnocchi was good.  Also had the scallop scarpetta which really surprised me.  The cauliflower tomato side was delightful and the slices of the scallop were delicious.  -------------------------------------- Tasting menu sucks.  Totally overpriced.  Tried several things:  -  Cauliflower soup:  It was okay.. very creamy and not too much cauliflower taste.  -------------------------------------- Two stars.  How did I never know anything about this place when I went to school here forever?  Maybe I came here once for a drink.. I can't remember anymore.  What a delightful spot with outdoor seating so you can enjoy the summer nights.  First.. Sunday is half priced wine days... yum!  The Pinot Noir was the favorite amongst the Syrah and Malbec.  Second.. the cheese plate was heaven.  How delicious!  You have to try their jam and the bread is pretty good.  We also tried a few things for dinner.. the risotto and pig cheek pasta dish.  The risotto was decent but the pig cheek dish was good with a hint of chili.  For dessert we tried the ice cream cake which was yummy but quite small.  I heard the panna cotte is heaven but they do not serve it anymore because it's been on the menu for a while.. WHAT?!!  I know...  Overall lovely experience.. I hope they put the pana cotte back on the menu.  This is definitely fine dining in downtown Champaign... it's growing up slowly but surely."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely great meal at Bacaros! We went all vegetarian but the mushrooms, beets, and prizetta were awesome!"}
{"text":"First, I love the extensive wine selection! Their bottle selection is really impressive. We had the pizzetta for an appetizer which has a great combination of flavors! I also loved the risotto, it was amazing! The overall ambiance is beautiful, altho it was a tad bit loud. The service was excellent. The prices seemed relatively fair, but on the more expensive side for restaurants in Champaign. Overall, definitely recommend it for a romantic date night."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Bacaro five stars. To be fair, there's a lot to like about it. The quality of the ingredients is high. The ambience is great too. The servers are among the most professional in the C-U area. The food is genuinely sophisticated. However Bacaro's commitment to local, seasonal ingredients, while being one of its strengths, is also one of its greatest weaknesses. The menu at Bacaro is constantly changing based on what ingredients they stock. This tends to result in inconsistent dishes whose preparations are constantly changing. Of three visits I've eaten some bad, ok and great meals.  Visit 1:  Had halibut with some kind of crust in a mint-gazpacho. The fish was fresh and of excellent quality. This was frustrating however because the fish was coated in a greasy crust that became soggy from the fish sitting in the mint gazpacho. The gazpacho was also greasy and was not pleasantly minty. What could have been a complex, herbaceous broth, wound up tasting like greasy mouthwash. Fantastic ingredients but badly executed prep.  Visit 2:  Valentine's Day prix-fixe. Three courses all of which were delicious. The appetizer was some kind mediterranean type salad if I recall with olives and I think preserved lemon. Delicious and fresh! My main was halibut again, with some kind of vanilla saffron sauce. The fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was complex and homey. My girlfriend got the steak and it was of great quality with a strong preparation to match. The dessert was a chocolate torte with blood orange sorbet- good flavors that were well-executed.  Visit 3:  Pork loin with mustard spaetzle. The spaetzle were delicious! I could eat that spaetzle every day. The pork however was DRY. Really, really dry. I was trying to conserve the mustard sauce on the plate in order to make sure there was enough to get on each slice of pork. It was that dry.   So in closing out of three, expensive visits, the food has been good maybe 1.5 times- with me being able to say I enjoyed one complete meal (valentine's day) and the side of one of my mains (the spaetzle). If the food was consistent, Bacaro would be an easy 5-stars. Hopefully they can strike a balance moving forward between rotating fresh, seasonal ingredients and maintaining a consistently-executed menu."}
{"text":"I was so incredibly disappointed.  I love gourmet food, and I thought I was going to get some pretty good, gourmet italian.  I had to wait over an hour for my reservation, our water was never refilled, and the food was very over-priced.  I paid almost $30 for the ribeye steak which was the worst ribeye I have ever had.  If you want ribeye, go to Jim Gould's.  Their mashed potatoes were very much like the kind you make from a box.  After I ate there, I went to kofusion for dessert.. it was THAT bad.  It is also so small.  There are not even 10 tables in that restaurant, and I can not even believe they are still in business.  I was so pissed after eating here, that this restaurant is the reason I made an account on yelp.. to tell you all that it sucked."}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff!! Can wait to go again and try more great food!! Truffle Fries were so fabulous!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good meal here. To start, I ordered the warm lobster and fennel \"salad.\" I put salad in quotes because it was more of a little appetizer than a salad. A good portion of lobster, some fennel, and a rich buttery sauce made for a good start to my dinner. The only catch is one small piece of my lobster tasted very ammonia like, so the freshness may have been a little questionable. It's never a good thing to get that waft of ammonia from eating seafood. For my entree, I ordered the duck with polenta and fried mushrooms. I have to say, this was a pretty excellent dish. The duck was cooked well, the polenta was creamy, the sauce was tasty, and the fried mushrooms were outstanding. They were crispy and chewy and added great texture and flavor to the dish. For dessert, we had the donuts and the chocolate truffles on the table. The donuts were good but a little dense and even with the sauce and the nuts I thought they still needed a little something. The truffles had incredibly strong chocolate flavor, topped with just a bit of flaky sea salt. Delicious, but not for the faint of heart. Overall, it's a bit pricey even for one of the few higher end restaurants in the area but the food is solid and the atmosphere is nice. I think it could be a 4 star meal if I didn't have that one bite of lobster that tasted like ammonia and if the desserts were a tiny bit better. However, I enjoyed Bacaro and would return for a special occasion dinner."}
{"text":"Flavors were generally ok, but the pork and rabbit were overcooked and the scallops weren't seared properly.  Also, the portion sizes were a bit large: we'd have preferred more quality and less quantity for the price.  Update: we returned a second time to a much better meal.  The lack of consistency should be a big concern for the owner, though."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a date night or a special occasion, but it does have some caveats.   We went for our first anniversary.  Staff were excellent - greeted us with free Prosecco, lots of happy anniversaries, and so on.  Staff are incredible, professional, courteous, knowledgeable, patient, responsive, and kind.  Really kudos there.   Portions are small - you probably would expect that in this sort of establishment.   We opted for a la carte options.  I don't mind paying top dollar for great food, but the total for two people prix fixe with wine substitution is $240 before tip.  Now again, I don't mind paying, but there are michelin starred restaurants in fabulous cities that are not -this- expensive.  This is Champaign, a small but charming place in central Illinois.    Wife and I had a bottle of wine, two pasta entrees, and two desserts to the tune of about $110 after a nice tip (20-25%) - You can eat reasonably here if you avoid the prix fixe menu.   The food was great.  Everything was jam packed with flavor, perfectly cooked, and elegantly presented.   Would definitely return for another 'date night' or special occasion.  Definitely not a place to go for dinner if you're looking for grub, though."}
{"text":"Dining in Champaign has come a long way since I went to school here. Food was amazing. Awesome service. Pricing and portions were more on par with Chicago so that was interesting.   Would definitely recommend and if I'm ever back in the area, I'd love to go back!"}
{"text":"I went for the first time on a Wednesday. I agree with the previous review that this is the place to go for fine dining in Champaign. The wine list was excellent and extensive, probably has the best wine selection in Champaign. Dinner was all-around great, as was the service. The food was fresh. Yes it may be a splurge for the area, but coming from Chicago, it was nice a very nice find."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a disappointment for me.  I was really excited to try it since I heard the chef was an apprentice of Iron Chef Mario Batali (yes, I love the Food network).  The service wasn't great, and even though it seemed fancy, the decor wasn't all that great either.  The food is expensive (which I was expecting), but the pasta that I got was pretty bad and for some reason tasted a lot like bacon (which I wasn't expecting).  Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, but not when it doesn't have bacon in it and isn't supposed to taste like that at all..  I definitely wouldn't go back here, but it was an interesting experience."}
{"text":"The finest dining restaurant anywhere around. The farm to table cousine is perfectly prepared. Our service is always fantastic and we bring our whole family--our children love the octopus. This is a prime example of \"you get what you pay for\". type of dining. Cocktails are consistently delicious and  the wine recommendations are excellent."}
{"text":"After many years of bringing friends and family here I will never return. Last night I had purchased two 7-course tasting menus with wine pairing. My guest and I were cut off of our wine pairing in a manner that could have been handled much better. My guest and I were by no standard misbehaving, so this came as a shock to us. I am very disappointed. Save your time and head up to Chicago for a restaurant with better management."}
{"text":"Hands-down one of the most interesting restaurants in Champaign, their wine selection is second to none, with food that confounds Midwestern cuisine expectations.  Though seating can be a challenge on weekend nights, it only speaks to the quality of what they offer."}
{"text":"Excellent service. They were very busy so the food was slow but they kept our mouths entertained with free bread and appetizers. Of course it is pricey but it is worth it. Food was excellent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Bacaro for an amazingly romantic dinner date.  I was impressed with the atmosphere, the knowledgable waitstaff, and flavorful. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I still can't decide whether this is a 2 or 3 star restaurant. If you put the restaurant together as a whole package including the ambiance, the uniqueness of the food, and culinary innovation you would get a 3 star restaurant, however the flip side is that the culinary flavors do not resemble anything like the gastronomic experience you get when you dine at Next in Chicago or Charlie Trotters when it was still open. You pay quite a premium for the dish that are notably small. Our dinner meeting was held at this location. There is plenty of meter parking, just remember to not go over or you will likely be ticketed. I started my meal with the wagyu beef stew which had smoked potato and a bone marrow crostini. I can honestly say the crostini was amazing with bone marrow that offered an amazing umami flavoring, however the actual stew was salty, the beef was not tender by any means sort of tasting like a dinty moore stew. This cost 13 dollars and the portion size was very small. My main entree for 33 dollars was the grilled lobster tail with kale, crispy black truffle polenta, and additional lobster claw and pieces of lobster on the side with a acidic lemon tasting sauce. Once again the portion size was quite small as you see from my picture. I don't believe you get the whole lobster tail as it looked like 1/2 of a lobster tail. There was a piece of claw meat on the side and the other side was shredded lobster meat. The lobster was cooked well, tender and well flavored with the black truffle polenta balancing the seafood, however the attempt at the different texture from the arugula/kale along with the soft polenta and the lobster did not work. Our meal ended with a flourless chocolate cake with blood orange champagne foam and pomegranate jelly. The grapefruit foam hit the spot, but again the cake was a sliver and for that cost you would think the portion would be bigger. Due to the long wait for the waiter to bring the dessert menu, I ended up getting my first parking ticket in Champaign. So I agree the flavors and small portion size at this price do not make this a place that I will frequent. As another yelper said, if you want to impress your date this maybe an interesting place to try, however I am going to try to find another culinary gem elsewhere.  Pros: local sustained food, changing menu  Cons: VERY expensive, small portion size- I left hungry, taste and texture just does not work for some dishes  Hidden deals: If you really want to impress your date, try the 7 course tasting menu at 85 dollars. I don' t know if that is a deal but at least you get to try everything for $$$"}
{"text":"I've been here over the years and it's been hit or miss. My most recent visit was very good. We had a party of 4 on a Sunday. We had the steak, fried lamb and gnocchi. The lamb was very good. The gnocchi was a bit bland. I personally had the steak. I ordered it mid rare, but it came rare. Which ended up being ok because it was a very nice cut of meat. The only issue was that it was on the salty side and being served on top of parm fries made it very salty. Overall very unique menus and flavors. Things are on the salty side it seems. The wine selection is the best in town no question and amazing service."}
{"text":"Awesome. I went here with my boyfriend on our 2 year anniversary and we totally spoiled ourselves. The food was interesting, nicely presented, perfectly portioned and delicious! We had the chef's tasting menu and I'm so happy we did. There were things that the waitress brought out that I would have never thought to order but ended up loving more than the others. I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Been here many times before and so had certain expectations. Food, service, and ambience always excellent. Well tonight things went quite differently. It was looking like a total disaster. Issues with food service reservations etc. Then Rose (asst mgr) came to the rescue. Within a few minutes everything was made right. Loved Bacaro before, love them even more now. Definitely will be back. Rose was simply amazing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me and took me here for my birthday and boy did he make a great choice. We each ordered the tasting menu and neither of us were disappointed. Everything we were served was amazing. We had things like drunken goat cheese and  several other things we had never tried before that we both just loved. I can usually find something I don't like when I go somewhere but with this restaurant I had not one issue. Everything from the staff to the atmosphere was just simply wonderful. I cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I had the 6 course tasting flight tonight at Bacaro and it was incredible.  My friend and I ate and drank wine for 3 hours, and I felt completely taken care of but not intruded upon by our totally awesome, knowledgeable, helpful waiter the entire time.    100 thousand props to said waiter, who didn't give the check to my male dining companion just because there were two of us and my male dining companion was male.  I can't agree with the other reviewers about the portions; I was FULL by the end of the third course and still had half a meal to go.  I think if I had even just ordered the linguini that was our 3rd course I still would have been full.  This is definitely a special occasion kind of restaurant, but I will certainly go back if I ever have a special enough occasion again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but a bit pricey for what you get. Compared to higher end restaurants in Chicago the food here isn't really that expensive and the quality is generally very good. However, there are many places in Champaign which both cook well and charge lower prices as well (usually ethnic food though).  Seating is limited and parking can be difficult to find but there's really no doubt that the food served here is the best in Champaign."}
