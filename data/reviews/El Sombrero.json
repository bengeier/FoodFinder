{"text":"Being a big fan of spicy fare I have tried all of the mexican restaurants in the city. This is the best one. But, but, but there is one caveat...you need to know the secret. 
The secret is hiding in the impossibly big menu. Get the MEXICANA COMBINATION!  That's it. It's huge, it comes out in a reasonable time, & it is the best Mexican meal in the city.  You will be very satisfied after this one.  I opt for the mole (pron: molay) over the tomato sauce as well.  For spice, throw on their red AND green El Yucatan habanero sauces that are sitting at the tables. Careful with these though, they are quite flavorful, but unforgivingly hot. Unless you have an iron stomach, go easy the first few times cowboys & girls.  You'll see what I mean. 
They also happen to have some very nice tequila kicking around ;)
I have gone here 2 nights in a row on several occasions.  (Just make sure you walk in & they see you when you first get there so you're seated right away.)"}
{"text":"Food ***** - Service *****- Ambience **

One of the best non fusion mexican places I have been to. Their wet burrito is Ammmaazing & MaSSSive. I find them a bit pricey but they do make up for it with their portion size and super friendly service. I have been a repeat customer to this place. 

Off late I have been going there specifically to buy their salsa. After I had their salsa, I stopped buying salsa from grocery stores. It is simply the best salsa I have ever tasted. 

Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken quesadilla and the wet burrito. Got complimentary nachos with salsa dip. 

The owner was kind enough to let us know that we ordered enough food when we were about to order a third item (since there were only 2 of us)

Good food. Little pricey for what it is.

You have to place the order at the counter and the food will be brought to your table then after the meal you'd pay at the counter. Hmmmmm ....."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is always fresh - I am not a big Mexican food fan, but their wet burritos are fantastic, Huge and filling !"}
{"text":"They have great Mexican food. I had the chicken quesadilla and it was very tasty. Seating outdoor under the grape vines was relaxing. Recommend this place"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after reading all the amazing reviews on here, and I couldn't agree with everyone else more. I had the Mex Burger, and it really was like a taco, chilli in the shape of a burger. It was unlike any burger I've ever had before, albeit it was a bit messy to eat with the chilli spilling out of the burger, but I believe the messiest burgers are always the most delicious. Also, who doesn't love some guac on their burger? The fries though were my complete favourite, they were crispy and had a sprinkle of what I believe were chipotle spice. The price isn't that pricey considering the quality of the food and the portion. I was full for another 6 hours after devouring that burger, definitely worth the price.

They also provided free nacho chips with salsa which were super good as well, the chips were crunchy and had a pinch of salt on it so it was tasty even without the salsa. I would definitely come here again if I'm ever in Mississauga..we definitely need a place like this in Toronto."}
{"text":"this place is the bomb. authentic Mexican which is hard to come by I  the gta. love it."}
{"text":"When a co worker told me about an authentic Mexican restaurant close to work I could not wait to go!! I was surprised and extremly satisfied with the food and the service :)

The atmosphere of the little restaurant is very pleasant and the you can smell the food from the parking lot. 

They have a wide selection of different Mexican dishes including burritos, tacos, enchiladas and a ton more. I decided to go with the chicken burrito with everything on it. They don't put the hot sauce directly into your food but give you a HUGE selection of different hot sauces that you can bring to your table. The burrito itself was MASSIVE and full of different fresh flavours. Everything tasted juicy and extremely fresh. The restaurant also has a full bar with a decent selection of wines, liquor and beer.

In total my bill came out to $14 and this included the huge burrito and a Dos Equis so it was a great price. I will definitely coming back here to try the different foods and all the different hot sauces!!!"}
{"text":"Service was prompt. Cute decor. Average food at best and definitely NOT authentic Mexican or even Texmex.  Having said that, most Mexican chains in Toronto aren't very good."}
{"text":"Always looking for new places to try, El Sombrero did not disappoint. I tried the Enchiladas topped with salsa and cheese, full of flavour and fresh, served with rice beans and queso fresco. Great food, service and price. Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"I recently went to this place.  Food is decent, however it's very expensive.  I ordered a Quesadilla and fries and it cost $16.  That's kinda expensive for a place like this.  Food is good, but not worth that kinda money.

I've been to the place twice before and it's been pretty empty both times.  They need to lower the prices a bit and they will be much busier than now."}
{"text":"Sign in window clearly indicated $11.99 for Monday-Tuesday special. The person  (owner?) inside refused to honour the deal, stating that the $11.99 special was for Wednesday (the sign did not indicate that and any reasonable person would read it as Monday-Tuesday special). 

The owner said that they'd give me the deal but they wouldn't include the measly can of Coke. Now, this is a warning sign: the owner would rather save the 30-50 cents (or less) he paid for the can of Coke than satisfy a customer due to an incorrect or unclear sign that they made. This makes me wonder what else they do behind the scenes to save money. Thus, I left. 

Lately their menu items are way overpriced anyway. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is as authentic a Mexican restaurant as you will find in this area of Mississauga.  Highlights include the fish tacos and the wet burrito.  The service is fast and if you eat in, includes complementary chips and salsa.  The staff is friendly and courteous.  Only drawback is that they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I will always recommend El Sombrero to anyone looking for good Mexican food in Calgary. We always eat well and love the authentic feel of the place. The live musician is always a treat as well. 

It's not perfect (a bit too loud and the menu could have more vegetarian options) but it's pretty darn good. 

I suggest you order the guacamole appetizer, the house special, and a glass of sangria. That'll make for a great evening out!"}
{"text":"Good, authentic Mexican food for a reasonable price on 17th Ave. 

El Sombrero is on the 2nd floor of the building, there is a different restaurant below it. 

Went on a Thursday night and the place was reasonably busy. The host/server quickly seated me. 

Ordered the house combination (the actual name was in Spanish but meant the same thing). For $20, received a beef burrito, a chicken taco, deep fried cheese pickles, re fried beans, guacamole, a platter of home made nacho chips, rice and some salad. 

Overall, each item on the dish had a distinct and good flavor. None of it was over-spicy, which is ok as they have various hot sauces on the table if that is your thing. 

The one negative I had was that the server was a little distant. This didnt affect the speed of service but it was a little odd. Overall a good experience and I will sure to be back with friends to start a 17th ave night."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food i have ever tried. Wet burrito is a must try. Little pricy. Online menu prices are not updated."}
{"text":"Finally, a good mexican joint in the west end!

This place serves up some authentic mexican grub, tacos, enchiladas, burritos. I've only tried the tacos, enchilada's and taquitos, boy they were absolutely fantastic! This is the best mexican I've ever had since moving to Mississauga 20 years ago. 

It's just a little eat-in/take out place in Mississauga, the same plaza as My Apartment. One reviewer was right, it does have a bar feel to it, but don't let that stop you from eating here. Homemade tortilla chips, salsa, and guacamole, can't beat that! Kind of pricey ($6.99 for 2 tacos, $13.99 for enchiladas), however if you've got a craving for Mexican, then it's definitely worth the extra bucks.

Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot!  I had the chicken burrito which was excellent. Very huge portions. Another in my party had the enchiladas. The only downside might be ordering at the counter, but don't let that fool you. The quality is excellent and the dining area makes it feel like a real restaurant experience.  My daughter ranked it higher than other burrito hotspots in the area too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I should state that this is only my 2nd time ever having Mexican food so I'm a noob and my review might not be most indicative of if this is a 'good' place for Mexican.

Went here for dinner with my partner on a Wednesday night.  The restaurant was quite busy but not full.  We were seated immediately and perused the menu which had some interesting sounding items on it.

We decided to order the special dinner menu which consists of:

- 2 beef chimichangas
- 2 chicken burritos
- 2 vegetable quesadillas (I think they were quesadillas)
- rice
- refried beans
- home-made corn chips with salsa

all for the awesome price of $28.  Note, you may have to ask for their dinner special.  We were only handed the regular menus when we were seated.

It was a lot of food for the 2 of us.  The corn chips were good and my partner liked the salsa but I thought it needed some more seasoning.  Then the entrees' came and we both had the chimichangas and burritos and were pretty full after that.  Both the chimichanga and the burrito were awesome, my favourite being the burrito.  They only had meat in them with nothing else and I especially liked the chicken.  The refried beans were surprisingly tasty to me as I don't usually like beans.  I also thought the rice needed a touch of salt.  The portion sizes were big enough that we went home with a doggy bag.

Overall for less than $30 I thought the meal was pretty good and definitely good value for money.  Service was okay but not great.  I liked the décor and atmosphere of the place and some of the food was really good.  I would probably go back again but this wouldn't be on top of my list."}
{"text":"Wow ; I was so hungry and had a wet burrito chicken all I can say it was amazing ! My friend share the other burrito it's a very good size ; 
The price did reflect the quality ! and it's really nice to give the guys tips! They work so hard -  you can't eat there without leaving tips- because they do serve you all the way ! 
highly recommend this place very good food you will love it  !"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. The service was fast and friendly the food spicy and delicious. Even my picky husband enjoyed his fajitas and rice. I had the burritos and loved every bite. 
The service was quick, the food was hot and the drinks cold.
Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Yelp pointed me to El Sombrero after leaving a client meeting in the commercial 401/Hurontario neighbourhood. As expected, I was not led astray.

I had a hard time choosing between the traditional options, but finally decided on enchiladas. Served with rice and beans it's a heart meal for lunch. I managed to eat all three delicious chicken enchiladas, but couldn't get through most of the sides.

Note that silverware is at the cash. I was left looking around like a goof until they were pointed out right in front of me.

If you're ever in the area this is a great, timeless hole-in-the-wall."}
{"text":"el sombrero is just across the street from where I work. The food is good and the owner is extremely nice and friendly. We've come here a few times already. This time one of our orders was forgotten but they rushed it out to us afterwards (made fresh), refunded the order (unnecessary but an extremely nice gesture), and even packaged it to go just incase we didn't have time; very considerate. The service is really good even though it is not your traditional dine in restaurant. Will come back."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican ever eaten.  I used to like to eat here.  Today my husband had the wet burrito and I had the nachos.  The nachos were burnt tasting and the pico de gallo was had so many onions it tasted bitter.  The meat tasted overcooked and burnt as well.  The cheese sauce had no flavor.  The only thing that tasted good was the guacamole.  I told the owner the chips were burnt tasting and that the nachos were terrible.  He basically just shrugged his shoulders.  My husband said he felt sick after eating his burrito and hopes he does not get sick tonight."}
{"text":"Didn't really mean to go here, but while looking for places to eat, accidentally clicked on it. Place exceeded expectations. Only tried their wet burrito and chili but they were really good."}
{"text":"I live in Brampton and that day I was craving Mexican food. Usually I would stay near the area and go to Bar Burrito or Burrito Boyz, but I believed I needed to expand beyond these two restaurants. Searched Yelp and El Sombrero came to mind. Walking in I was impressed by the interior to give that culture feel. You seat yourself and food is ordered behind the counter. My meal is very fulfilling and the complementary nachos was a nice add-on while they were preparing your food. Worth very penny and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is seriously awesome.  After going through withdrawal symptoms from stuffing my face with deliciousMexican food...in Mexico, I was plesantly surprised to find this place.  I have eaten there like 8 times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Hola!  Is this place authentic?  I don't know!  What I do know is this place is dang good!  

We asked for suggestions and they said \"For the senor, a wet burrito, for the lady a chicken quesadilla\".  I was hoping for chicken mole, or something more authentic, but whatever we went with the suggestions.  

Chips and salsa come complementary.  No thanks.  The chips were really stale.  The wet burrito was delicious-filled with CHUNKS of pork (not shredded) cilantro and rice, covered in a fresh tomato sauce and some cheese.  Quesadilla-pass. 

Next time, ask for a \"senor's\" meal and ask for the pork wet burrito....even if you're a lady."}
{"text":"It's been a while since last time we had burritos and quesadilla in Cancun. This is a very fast and tasty restaurant. Love it."}
{"text":"This place is well known by the locals who are in search for a good bite for lunch.

May we start with the food? I'll limit this only to the dishes that I've tried.  

First off, the burritos.  They are my mainstay staple whenever I visit and are simply amazing!  El Sombrero's burritto is different than that of the former Burrito Boyz found in Downtown Toronto on Peter but can easily standout on its own.

The other offerings I've tried? The quesadillas and fajitas are standouts and favourites among some of my co-workers.  Watch out for the chips that are on the counter for sampling - the spiciness doesn't quite hit you immediately and you'll soon find yourself searching for a drink!

As for the place itself, it's typical of a small restaurant - very clean, nice decor.  The only but - during the lunch rush, forget finding a seat unless you arrive early, and that's especially moreso as the weather warms up.  Summer opens up the patio, but then the popularity of the place draws more fans out of the woodwork."}
{"text":"We tried to dine here in Oct. 2013 and the place was shuttered. Their phone number is also no longer in service. Presumably they are no longer in business."}
{"text":"My sweet lil amigos & amigas...let me tempt you...
Chile Rellenos (deep-fried cheese stuffed poblano peppers).
Mole Chicken (breast with Mexican chocolate-based sauce).
Combinacion Platter (combo of a burrito, enchilada and a chile rellenos).
Real lime margaritas.
Home-made salsa.
Mexican fried ice-cream.
Convinced yet?
Would a strolling spanish guitarist, fun colourful decor and prime 17th Avenue location convince you further?

If not, you are muertos to me! :o)"}
{"text":"It's definitely tough to find good Mexican food this side of the border. Mississauga is just not known for that (although we have great Asian food). Or at least that's what I thought until I stumbled across this little gem. Hands down some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. It's more of a fast food place then a restaurant but everything was so delicious, with huge portion sizes, and the prices are reasonable too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Love the tacos, quesadillas, wet burrito and lentil soup. Great place for lunch or dinner. Wish they were open on Sunday's. When I get burritos elsewhere I'm usually disappointed they're not as good as El Sombrero. They might be a little more expensive but they're worth it."}
{"text":"Simple mom and pop restaurant with unique Spanish sodas. Quick and kind staff. Beautiful outdoor patio with flowers. The food itself was okay. Too much sauce on the taco bowl salad - but the flavor itself was good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food outside of Mexico. The staff is friendly, the food is fresh and there is always a line up at lunch during the weekdays.  I have been a loyal customer for almost 12 years.  The fish tacos, burrito, and chilli are my favourites and of course their Mexican pop."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!
Found it by accident, it's kind of hidden.  
The food is authentic and fresh.  Fair prices and cute interior.  There's also a patio which is a bonus.
They use real corn tortillas for the soft tacos instead of flour which I love, really Mexican.
The staff/owners are the real deal and very friendly.
Wish this place was close by, I'd be there every day!"}
{"text":"We orderd fish in the dish and veg.enchilladas. 
Positives: very friendly staff, free nachos and salsa, good quantity with suitable pricing
Negatives: The fish was hard, precooked and microwaved at the time of service.almost felt like chicken consistency 
God knows why they added feta cheese in our mexican dishes 
We went on a pleasant summer day hoping to enjoy the patio - but they aren't serving in the patio :("}
{"text":"This place is not bad but isn't super great either .. their tacos and burritos are just a little better than the average .. have been here once .. don't plan to go again"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat some grub around my work and I happen to see this here on yelp. Well worth it. I got the wet burrito and man I didn't expect it to be that filling. The sauce was great fresh toppings  could be a bit better if I put some hot sauce but I had a little time before my break ended. I would go back and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"This place is an underrated place for the best Mexican food in Mississauga!  The place is small and a bit of dated furniture.  I lived here for over 30 years and even with the newer Mexican franchises, nothing has compared to El Sombrero!  Rich flavours, huge portions, great value and the staff and owner make you feel so welcome!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I think the good comments here are fake. This place is NOT authentic and definitely not TexMex!!! The only time I visited I was told the owner was from Iraq  and the spices used are definitely not mexican! Ok you've been warned! Only thing mexican is the decor and music but definitely not the tacos or enchiladas etc etc."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, as is the authentic LA-style Mexican dishes. Delicious. Thank you El Sombrero at Financial Drive!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for a late lunch today. It was my first time so I just randomly selected the chicken torta off the menu board. It was a small chicken breast (probably a chicken breast sliced in half) on a nice soft bun with guacamole, mayo, and pico de gallo. I opted out of the cheese. The chicken sandwich was delicious, but the protein was a bit on the smaller side and I didn't get any of the \"complimentary\" nachos that other Yelpers have mentioned in their reviews. Perhaps they don't do that anymore. 

If you're not too hungry, the chicken torta is a nice-sized meal. If you're hungry, you'll need to order a side if they're not giving out complimentary nachos or ask if you can double up on the protein on your sandwich. 

I definitely want to come back to try out their burritos and tacos."}
{"text":"Great food! The setup is different - you order from a menu and then they bring it to you. I ordered chicken fajitas that came with black beans and rice. My coworkers had wet burritos and enchiladas and said they were good. There is a small bar but when one coworker asked for a margarita, the bartender said, \"Sir, I'm sorry, but we are just too busy\" (they didn't look too busy) and he ended up with a beer. There isn't a lot of indoor seating, so our party of 6 sat on the patio. I'm not sure where everyone would fit during cold winter months. Overall though, it was a nice little joint I'd return to!"}
{"text":"Service was fast- good was okay- I had the fajitas they were a bit dry and had very few accompaniments (no sour cream, guac, cheese on side- just a little on top).  Tortillas were really good."}
{"text":"Great location. Nice patios. Love the singers that come out and play guitar/sing for you while you eat.  I've heard people complain about the service, but I think it's great. The server I had was quick and attentive without the fake smile. He would do his job and take off. Me likey. The drinks are strong (yup! :) and the food is simple, delicious and authentic. Great price too. I went for dinner and had some salad and then beef fajitas. Everything was so filling that I didn't have room for dessert (this is rare for me as I live by the mantra of 'there's always room for dessert!'). 
Overall, I highly recommend this place. 
Es muy bueno ;)"}
{"text":"Much better than mucho burrito and all burrito joins I have tried. Quantity was normal. Not less not much.  Servers were friendly. Price is comparable to any burrito chain. I would visit again for sure. Never back to mucho now :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly people. Easy on the pocket. The options are as expected. Pretty standard and great."}
{"text":"Yo quiero El Sombrero!

Went here twice.

First time - I was on my own and ordered the Wet Burrito (chicken).  Big enough to leave me stuffed.  Very tasty and a nice alternative to the burrito joints springing up around town.

Second time - I was with my wife and I ordered the Enchiladas and my wife ordered the Burrito.  Service was not as good the second time (they made a few errors with the order, but were quick to fix it up).  Also tried the mexican fries with chili.  They have a nice seasoning salt on them, which made them yummy.

Overall, it's good, but it's not outstanding.  Nothing really blew me away (then again, nothing really does.)

However, in the words of Schwarzenegger \"I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Friday was my first visit to the relatively new location of this growing Mississauga Mexican food chain. The third location to open is now located on Tomken Rd just south of Eglington.

The potential of this location is great, with a large patio with music playing happily and what appears to be a covering for said patio, it would appear a Mexican fiesta is possible at any time of the year.

Given the time of day of my visit, it was empty (between meals) and I was greeted by the counter attendant within moments of arrival. Having never eaten at any of the El Sombrero locations, I asked for some recommendations which she happily provided and went through the menu items with me. Standout recommendations for me were the enchiladas, tacos and the burrito. I ended up going with the sauce covered 'wet' burrito made with chicken.

Be advised, compared to other burrito and taco spots, I felt their prices to be higher than the average. Almost $9 for 2 tacos, where I can get 3 of a kind at Gourmet Gringos in Aurora for a little more. Also, the price of their burritos is for that of a plain burrito with no meat, the price listed beneath the main price is the actual price if you're getting a meat option.

Once I was seated, I was treated to a basked of chips and salsa while I waited. It's a simple thing to offer (even in a takeaway style joint such as this) but an element of the service that many GTA Mexican places miss out on. Points to El Sombrero - I appreciated this.

The food turnaround time was questionably quick in my opinion. I'm happy to wait the 10 minutes as I do at Burrito Boyz for something that is cooked all the way through on the flat top, this was served up in little over 5 minutes, and in my opinion there were some gaffs that could be avoided.

1) Rice was overcooked (lots of water in it) and the burrito was more than 60% rice - no bueno
2) Burrito was not warmed up/cooked after being filled and wrapped - no bueno
3) Burrito was then sauced and shredded cheese tossed along the top and served (it should have at least been put under the salamander to melt the topping cheese down a bit - no bueno
4) Albeit well cooked and well seasoned, the chicken portion in my burrito was sparse - no bueno

Overall, an 'OK' experience in terms of service and taste, however I felt this to be more of a Mr Sub/Subway assembly style Mexican offering as opposed to \"Fine Mexican Food\" as their slogan would suggest. Some tweaks and I think they'll be on the right track.

Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I can't believed I missed this place and I live down the road from it. 
Will definitely be going back to try other items on the menu. 
I had the chicken enchilada."}
{"text":"be careful while ordering Salsa or Guac. they can rip you off by over charging.
corn chips can be very hard and hurt you.

Wet burrito is a safe choice"}
{"text":"Get the enchiladas!!! Their best dish likely. Great with guacamole too. Grab a beer and watch the World Cup...."}
{"text":"Good deals on tacos and a variety of meat options. Central location and clean. Staff is friendly and service is fast. Their sauces add a whole new dimension to their food"}
{"text":"This place should be called \"Nom nom Sombrero\" The food is amazing!!! It's a line up and order what you want kind of deal, and take your food to a table (either inside or out, they have a small patio) Fast service, reasonable prices, really large portions.  I had beef enchiladas it came with rice and black beans, everything was just so tasty, I ate it all!  I will definitely be back here to try out some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I am giving them 3 stars on their breakfast only, \"Huevos Ranchero\" it came with rice, black beans, two runny eggs, and little bit of salsa, I opted from the cheese option as I cannot do dairy.

it was just OK for me, am not going order that again, but I saw other customers ordering big salads and mammoth Burritos, next time I will give that a shot.

On the flip side, the customer service was great, they treat like you are at their \"Casa:\" and the coffee was really fresh and nice.

I also want to go there in a hot summer day for their patio. I guess I have to wait til next year.

Thanks for reading"}
{"text":"Today was our first time here!! And OMG this place is a gem!! We had the wet burrito and it was absolutely delicious..... And not to mention huge for $12.99 and you get a sample of tortilla chips which were good too! The owner and workers there were very pleasant and attentive! Be sure if your in the Mississauga area to visit this gem! We'll be back!! ( forgot to take pic... Was really hungry! Lol! )"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today for the first time, it was amazing! Got the enchiladas. Definitely will be coming back to try the other items!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good ambience, music playing but not blaring, friendly counter staff. Just ordered the nachos but there was no skimping of any ingredients. I can see why there's a steady stream of people...worth a try!"}
{"text":"Service: 5/5
Atmosphere 3.5/5
Food: 0/5

First of all, the service here was FANTASTIC! Server and owner were very nice and accommodating. The atmosphere is amazing as well. Has a nice vacation feel to it. The food unfortunately was destructively non-Mexican. We ordered Enchiladas, which were not enchiladas. What we received was a plate with wet black beans and feta cheese, rice with soggy jalapeños, and three \"enchiladas\". The \"enchiladas\" we're three tortillas stuffed with beef stew and cheese and topped off with a bit of cheese and ragu pasta sauce. The entire meal tasted like salty beef stew and not Mexican at all. Compared to Mexican restaurants like Don Tequila in Buffalo, NY or Viva Mexico in Canton, GA this place is embarrassingly bad. The food was pre cooked and reheated so it wasn't fresh. 

This place is NOT a Mexican restaurant. It is a fast food chain. We were provided with old chips and store bought salsa as complimentary appetizers as most Mexican restaurants do. 

Recommendations:

1. Do not use pasta sauce as enchilada sauce. 
2. Do not use chopped beef cooked in beef stew. I know it seems like a great idea to use slow cooked beef stew since it makes the meat tender, but it also makes it salty and well....taste like beef stew. Use ground beef with the appropriate seasonings. It's cheaper and more authentic. 
3. Black beans are soggy. Provide an option of refried as well. Also, lay off the feta cheese. 
4. Use dry fresh jalapeños. Not soggy ones. 
5. Where are the hot sauces? Provide hot sauce for sit in customers. Do not sell the entire bottles on their own. 
6. Take a trip to the southern United States and get a taste for how Mexican food should be. If you can't go too far, I recommend you drive down to Buffalo and visit Don Tequila in downtown Buffalo. They are authentic and have top quality food! 

Again, service is amazing and the atmosphere is welcoming and great! But our fast food meal cost us $50. Not acceptable."}
{"text":"I had a salmon burrito this time...last time I had a beef burrito.  I think it was just ok.  Nothing really to wow about.  Maybe if I do choose to try it next time I will get a wet burrito.  Although the hot sauce they have at the tables is pretty good."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend. Both of us ordered burritos ($8.99 for chicken, $7.99 for veggie), the portions were huge and delicious. Plus the owner (and staff) was very kind and helpful. Great little place with a cantina-ish ambience. While not super authentic (more Tex mex), I'd definitely recommend it and left satisfied."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp. Looking for a quick lunch with a possible twist. So picked out this restaurant by the positive reviews and claim of authenticity. 
In a strip mall with a patio, I walked in to find brown mud and bright yellow painted walls and ceiling. The ambiance was as standard as possible. The food also standard. A good burrito, but the tortilla tasted out of a package. I suppose the concept of grilling the burrito is not authentic, because after filling and folding, it was handed to me straight away on an otherwise empty plate. 
$9.50 for a burrito, I tend to agree with others about the price. $2.00 less seem reasonable for a predominantly rice filled burrito.
It was okay, that's it."}
{"text":"I've had two experiences at this location and will not be going back. Though everyone is friendly, the food does not seem to be fresh, the flavours are lacking and the seasoning is inconsistent."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food, all typical Mexican food can be found here, this is my first visit, tried shrimp burrito (wet), shrimp is freshly made, taste pretty good, I will come back to try other dishes.

Service: 5
Food quality: 5
Price: 3, you are expected to spend more than average for a lunch"}
{"text":"I've become a regular at this place now, always grabbing lunch and we love their chicken taco salad. 

I call ahead every time to let them know I'm coming and they remember me when I come in.

Great ppl and always a pleasant place to come in.  I want to try other stuff but I love the salad lol"}
{"text":"Have been eating at this location for years.  Love the Veggie Enchiladas with rice and black beans on the side.  Portions are always a great size.  The owners are always really friendly and welcoming.  And, the music is always  a great add on to the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're expecting a Mexican atmosphere. The music plays loudly out on the patio (it's-17 outside) not in the restaurant and it's an English radio station. The people who were running it don't speak spanish. You have to seat yourself and find your own cutlery and napkins which I had to figure on my own as no instruction or information was offered. Worst of all, They Don't Have Fresh Coffee! What Restaurant Doesn't Have Coffee? They offered us Instant Coffee can you believe that? Very Disappointed. The food came out quickly which was a plus but the tables were wobbly and the floor needs to be re-done. We ordered the Huevos Rancheros, what a disappointment. The beans tasted bland like they came out of a can and not home made with onion/garlic or any seasoning, the eggs were smothered with salsa and and cheese. The rice was so so and the corn tortillas were used as a base under all the food so by the time i got tothem it was a big mushy mess, Tortillas should be served on the side not under all the food. This is not Authentic Mexican, the only thing Mexican about this place is the decor. I don't think this place will be around long."}
{"text":"My husband and I couldn't decide where to have lunch, then I remembered my daughter mentioned this place and said we had to try it.
Wow, I'm really glad we listened to her.
When we entered we were greeted with a hello and a smile, and when the gentleman noticed we were having a hard time deciding he made a recommendation for the special of the day. 
We had the enchilada platter special, I had 1 beef and 1 chicken enchilada and it came with rice, black beans, salsa, cheese and sour cream. I was so satisfied with the flavors and the size of the portions, the price is on the high side of average.
Totally would recommend this place and Definitely going to go bac?.

{"text":"I was looking for a more authentic Mexican restaurant and found it here.  I had the enchiladas with black beans and rice.  It was so tasty with just the right amount of spice.  Big portions and nice presentation.  Just what I was looking for!"}
{"text":"I must admit that i am a bit of a newbie to mexican food but have developed a taste for it recently.  I stopped in to a plaza to grab something at another vendor when i spotted this place and decided to give it a go instead of grabing the usual sandwich to go.  So i went in, and was greeted by some nice people, decided i wanted the steak burito and had a seat while they prepared it.  I was pretty content sitting there watching the news and eating chips and salsa waiting for my burito to be prepared then i was asked to step up and pick what i wanted on my burito.  When i stepped up i was greeted by a massive burito full of mexican flavor, and the person was answering my question about each topping or garnish so i was sure to have a burito perfect for my palet.  Now that was pretty awesome.  So when it was all wrapped up on a plate this thing was massive.  I've had a few buritos, but not one the size of this thing.  Talk about man vs. food.  This time the burito won, I just couldnt finish it all.  I tried, the flavor was excellent, and everything was fresh and tasty, and i love the cheese they put in there.  But at the end of it all i had to admit defeat and the burito was more than i could handle.  Next time i think i should share one or get half to go or something like that.  It was well worth the price, and i would love to go again.  I noticed they have a patio too, so I'm looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"As far as Mississauga is from Mexico (though they both start with a \"M\"), this place is definitely one of the better places for Mexican food in the area, dare I say all of Toronto?

All their tortillas and ingredients are fresh, the guac is great, generous portions, chip and salsa, fried tortillas drizzled with chocolate and cinnamon for dessert, and some authentic mexican flair...  this little diner spot definitely beats the Mucho Burrito and Chipotle chains in Toronto. 

I usually get the wet burrito, which is about $11. It's heavy, filling and might put you to sleep, but it's oh-so-good.  

For a slightly healthier alternative, the also have a salad bowl which I've also tried  which comes in a (i think) made on premises crunchy tortillas bowl.  It's pretty good, but I'd stick with the burritos, enchildas, tacos, etc. etc., which are all great.

Being a fan of tex-mex, you can't really compare it to places in the US of A which has aweeeeesome tex-mex for dirt cheap... but for Toronto, this place is just awesome and satisfies the tex-mex cravings I get every so often."}
{"text":"I love this place.  So far its been an enjoyable experience every time, and to add to that, the portion is huge.  Nobody leaves hungry.  I dont get to this area very often but i would say its my preferred mexican eatery when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Was returning from the airport and looking for lunch. Yelp hooked me up with this place. It was definitely a great suggestion.

It is located in a strip mall at the corner of Brunel and Hurontario. You can spot it quite easily in the summer time as the patio has grape vines growing over the seating area creating shade.

The interior of the restaurant gets a huge plus. The colour, the music, the smell.... they had the garage door to the patio open and it was a warm day. I had to keep reminding myself that I was no in Cozumel. 

The staff was friendly. The only down side is there is no waitress. You pony up to the counter and order your food. The menu is not extensive. I think they have less than a dozen items. I had the burrito and a dos equis to drink. 

The burrito appeared within 5 minutes of ordering it and it was fantastic. It was large, fresh and very tasty. The complimentary nachos were very tasty as well.

I look forward to returning and encourage you to try it out too."}
{"text":"It seems there are a small handful of El Sombrero restaurants in the Mississauga area.  I know quite a few years ago I went to the location in the industrial area of Brunel and Hurontario.  This was so long ago it had to be close to a decade or even more.  

If I'm not mistaken that place was a sit down place and it was more of a full service restaurant.  This location near the south west intersection of Eglinton and Tomken seems to be a more casual place.  It's basically cafeteria style however they do bring the dishes to you.  You have to pay at the counter and the plates are brought you otherwise you're probably taking out.  The flatware, napkins etc are all at the end of the counter to the right as well as a variety of popular and recognizable hot sauces for you to help yourself.  There's even a self serve water dispenser with glasses at the end of the counter too.  I ended up taking a few take out menus to the table for us to decide before going up to the counter to decide.

The only area large enough to seat us (8 of us) was at the very end of the counter (the right side) near the patio entrance door.  Because of this door not necessarily being sealed it was rather chilly in that seating area because of a cool draft that was incessant.  Most of the other tables in the area are all 4 or 2 seaters.  

I ended up order two wet burritos, one steak and one chicken (12 bucks each) as well as a large guacamole to share (13 bucks) along with two bottled drinks.  After tax it came out to about 47 bucks.  It seemed like a lot but these burritos are pretty much as big and as stuffed as many you'd get just about anywhere else like Burrito Boyz or Fat Bastard.  The guacamole came in a styrofoam take out type container.  We ended up getting another container to split it so we could share at the other table.  We were given two nice servings of tasty crunchy and salted corn tortilla chips with it.  The guacamole was ok and had a bit of a tang but it seemed too liquefied for me.  I prefer guacamole to be more chunky.  

The burritos were quite filling.  They had a bit of a kick but I added some green chili sauce to adjust it just a tad.  I ended up eating three quarters of mine and giving a quarter to my wife.  She ended up only eating half of her chicken so we ended up taking that home.  Between both of us 3/4 of a wet burrito was enough to be full so yes, the servings are quite generous.  My brother ordered some of the fries and I have to say those were great.  They were sort of like KFC's / Taco Bell but with some sort of seasoned salt / dry spice that made them quite flavorful.  

We ended up getting some churros as well at the end and even though I was full I'll always make room for a churro because it's a fried dough stick!  The churros were good and cooked the way I like them, crunchy as opposed to soft, chewy or under cooked.

Overall this food is OK.  I wouldn't say it's anywhere near as good as what I can ever remember getting in California but this place is simply a casual cafeteria / take out type of establishment.  The people seemed friendly and overall the place seems well kept and clean.

It was rather too cold at the big table because of the draft coming in from the patio door which sort of made if uncomfortable for some.  Both burritos I had tried were both filling and decent but not overwhelming while the portions are a decent value.  The bottom line is that it's OK Mexican food for Mississauga for a casual type place."}
{"text":"Another stop on my Insauga Top 5 burrito stops. Here they recommend the Salmon Burrito and also to get the burrito wet. Which I did! I normally stick to chicken/steak in my burritos but that's what my whole thing is about atm, trying new things and experiancing the best of sauga. That being said I probably won't order a salmon burrito again  the salmon tasted great but I just don't feel it belonged with all the other flavors. I'll stick to land meat thank you! The rice in the burrito had the perfect bite and they were so generous with their rice portions! Holy grains! They only had refried beans which was a downer cause I like whole textured beans in my burrito. The tortilla itself was much more Doughy than other places and the sauce they smothered on top as way too tomato-based. It was like marinara sauce lol. Andddd....they disnt grill it. Even if i didnt order it wet it still doesnt come grilled, which should be considered sacroligious at this point of the burrito band wagon. Still was a big burrito and gotta give it to then for that  El Sombre, you were a one night stand. Was fun but we'll never cross again lol."}
{"text":"There service was okay. But the food was not I got there enchilada combo one beef and one chicken. They chicken was okay not great and then beef was just bad it taste like my Vietnamese beef stew I cook at home. And the bean were surpose to be refried beans. But instead it look like beans from out of a can which is easy for everybody to make. There was no salad. The rice was okay.i also ordered a chilli because it looks so good in their picture , which was horrible.  me and my boyfriend had the same combo and everything came up to $40+. I wouldn't mind if they food was good. But not for me I rather drive further and go to Lindo they are there best and then price is unbelievable fir all these food they give plus they have really fresh salad and Rhys ifans beans. That's what you call true Mexican food.  They open because they enjoy cooking not for profit like this place."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday afternoon for an early dinner. I had chicken enchilada while my husband had the wet burrito (beef). The servings are quite big and we had to bring home some leftovers. I really enjoyed the food. It was served warm and fresh. My enchiladas came with a side of beans and rice. It was delicious and so filling. It was also served with a couple of slices of jalapeños. I would like to return and try their other offerings. 

The restaurant reminded me of beachfront cafes in tropical countries. It opens to a patio. There's music and cable tv to keep patrons entertained. It makes me want to go to the beach!"}
{"text":"Wandered here after a late night and WOW this food is the best! My mouth waters at just the thought of those cheesy enchiladas dazzling my taste-buds with ecstasy! The food is priced excellently and the people that work there are super nice. There was one chick with brown curly hair that was super cool and probably would go back just because of her even if the food wasn't delicious! Seriously GO, that's all I can say!"}
{"text":"Impressive Mexican place! Service was outstanding, with chips and salsa to munch on while waiting. 

Lots to choosw from, huge burrito, and lots of hot sauces to choose from. 

The loud music on patio makes no sense tho."}
{"text":"I had the wet burrito and was  delicious, service was great, my decision to get there was base on the excellent reviews and believe me, I am not disappointed, I will be back to try different Mexican food"}
{"text":"Small dining room. There is outside seating. I got a chicken burrito for lunch. Very soggy and oily ingredients used. It was ok, I wouldn't say it was the best quality ingredients. I got the last scrapings of beans in a dried out container (thank you) asked if I wanted everything on it. I said sure.  Then she asked me if I wanted it \"wet\"! Perhaps explaining what \"wet\" is instead of just starring blankly at me I might has responded better! Paid $12.30 for my chicken burrito - There are better burrito places in Mississauga! Also, the debit machine makes you tip. They should really give you an option for no tip, after all, pressing 0% for tip on the POS is just as rude as asking for one!"}
{"text":"I love you Mex fries with cheese!

This little gem is an awesome Mexican place. Great food, great prices and it's just a comfy little food joint. 

Staff are all friendly as heck, the decor is wicked Mexican inspired with tiles and all. They have a great little patio and a small little bar if you want to order a drink and eat there. 

Burritos, fish tacos, regular tacos, chili con carne, taquitos... the menu isn't huge, and that's good - cause you can try everything on it at least once.  They also have a bunch of hot sauces that you can take to your table, AWESOME. Love it here :)"}
{"text":"Finally real TeX Mex in Mississauga.  I've passed by this place many times and always thought it would be dingy inside , but to my surprise the place had a cute Latin feel to it and felt very homey. Ordered a Mex Burger with fries and it was delicious.  It was like a burger, burrito, and chilli all in one.

It was a beef patty, topped with guacamole, salsa and chilli in between a bun.  So yummy. While the combo was a bit pricey at 10.99, it was reasonable to me because of the quality of the food.  

Verdict: will definitely visit again.

Ps. Free chips"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is authentic, the operators have styled a Canadian restaurant  with their culture modestly yet authentically. The patio is great to enjoy a meal in warm weather, again furnished with some plants and vines that reflect authentic influence. It's a pleasant unexpected nook in the surrounding industrial area. The staff and/or operators smile a lot and are friendly.

The chicken quesadilla is amazing. The burrito seemed a bit oddly aromatic when eating to me, but tasted good. The burger was garnished like a burrito, I found the burger pretty standard otherwise. The mex-fries are extremely salty."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. Got a taco salad with chicken, no dairy or dressing (dietary restrictions)  and the meat was seasoned nicely, guacamole was actually green (as opposed to brown at other burrito joints), and the taco bowl was yummy too. I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Found this place from Yelp. So hard to find good Mexican/Latin food unless you're in Toronto proper but this place does it!

Enchiladas were on special so I tried that and they were absolutely delicious. Lots of food too. Cute decor and the cashier (who I imagine may have been the owner) was super friendly and helpful.

It's a bit out of my way but it's worth it. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"To bring some review LOVE back into this day rather than the general gloominess, I visited El Sombrero on a weeknight recently.  It has the usual Sombrero'd decor you would expect from a place named as such.  I was offered a snack of Salsa & Tortilla Chips to savour prior to the Meal arriving while watching American News.

Wet Burrito($10.99)  -  Half Beef, half Pork protein choice went into the mix(Rice, Sour Cream, Cilantro, etc...) wrapped in a warm soft Tortilla then the WET stuff came slip sliding along(Salsa, Shredded Cheese).

Note: some items might take more time than others(Burgers).

Knife & Fork affair as they Salsa danced in unison to dip Mexican flavours in me.  Arriba!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in Calgary. It is never too busy, the margaritas are affordable and delicious, and the food is fresh.

I have tried several dishes on the menu and all are tasty and unique. Try the combination plate - a great way to check out a bit of everything!

Also there was this chicken-chocolate dish. I forget the name but it has a spicy chocolate sauce and is especially good.

Another nice thing about this place is it is family run. The owner has been there for over 17 years and still waits tables and cooks dishes. It is great to go to a place like that!"}
{"text":"Easily the best place in Mississauga for Mexican food, decent value and tastes great too. Tacos run about 8+tax for two, 9 for salmon, but I recommend the haddock tacos. I've tried fajitas here as well and can say theirs pretty good, but they are a bit stingy on the meat for the fajitas so I wouldn't recommend those, they cost about 14.99. The payment system is a bit unique, but it makes a more comfortable dining experience, you order at a counter and they give you a little tray of chips and salsa which is complementary with every meal, then you grab a drink, seat yourself, and the food comes to you and you pay at the register. Overall, really friendly folk here, decent value, and great tasting food. They also try to make the food look good too with their plating and presentation."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than it's the best Mexican food In the area. Cannot recommend it enough. The nachos are excellent, definitely made to share though. I'm a huge fan of their fish tacos, they can be a bit dry, but they are absolutely delicious. Their dessert fried and chocolate covered chips are excellent too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for true Mexican food do not eat here. Why do so many people put fake reviews. Either people never had good Mexican food or there lying trying to boost business. If you cross the border and eat at one of thousands of Mexican restaurants in the USA. They taste so good you will never eat this kind of whatever they call it again. (Because it's not Mexican). I came here before to quickly use the washroom and noticed it was gross. 
 But after having a craving for Mexican I thought let's try it and see. I ordered two steak tacos. Reheated ground beef was store bought chili. The steak was stew beef ( it's not the same thing !!) 
 It was very gross, with   cheap cheese ate half and waste of 10$ and I tossed it out"}
{"text":"Having never been here I was not to pumped to go. Once we walked in and I saw the Valentinos hot sauce on the tables I started to relax. I have been to Mexico a couple times and have always lived in small towns to stay away from tourist areas. The food there is something I miss and had not found in Calgary before. Well going here was like taking a plane to Mexico for dinner. The flavours, the methods, the style all reminiscent of the small places I ate in Tulum. I loved every bite and will certainly go back. The only negative was it got pretty busy and there was only one server working so he got bogged down at times. If you haven't tried the food go there and bring an appetite, it is hard to limit what you order. Or maybe that is just me!?"}
{"text":"this place is legit.

you order (cafeteria style), and they give you some free nachos and salsa as you're waiting for your food.

pricing is very reasonable.  good value for your money.

the owners are cool too.  from LA, and definitely know what they're doing.

everyone i have taken there loves it!  

great work el sombrero.  see you guys soon."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food! Tapatio on deck. I got the vegetarian enchiladas and it did not disappoint. Good portions."}
{"text":"Good Tex-Mex food. Got the burrito and quasedilla. Would have much preferred if they asked what we wanted in our quasedilla before putting a lot of toppings. Other than that it was good."}
{"text":"Tried the wet chicken the dry chicken burrito and the chicken enchiladas portion is very generous but its really generic tasting. The salsa was nearly frozen and its really more of a plated fast food.l. not a very good deal at all."}
{"text":"One of my favourite mexican places! I love the service here. They are always friendly. The food is always great! My favourite is the wet burrito. After going to Mexico I find its not as similar to the traditional stuff but it sure taste damn great!!! Lol they also have there liquor license!"}
{"text":"Brutal - we went to the other location and they didn't have churros. So since this location was on the way home we decided to stop in, especially since someone had said the churros are good here. We walked in and there was only two people seated, but the staff was snickering at each other, acting all stressed out. They were abrupt when taking our order and apparently their dishwasher was broken so everything came in to go containers. 
The churros came smothered in chocolate sauce and no whip, which we had to ask for. They tasted so freezer burnt and disgusting we only ate half (see photo). They literally tasted like frozen eggos smothered in cinnamon and chocolate. They should be embarrassed about serving that. 
Also there was no ambiance, no music playing, the TV was on pause or frozen, and the staff was freaking out like they were so busy with no customers in front of them. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome food... Looking for good Mexican food small family run business this is the place!"}
{"text":"They serve beer now so the great to have with a meal.   The portions are large so you can easily split one main dinner between two people if you're hungry. The food here is average nothing special but it's hard to find anything great in this area."}
{"text":"I believe this is the original location. As I've posted elsewhere, this is very good authentic Mexican food with prices that are fairly reasonable, but perhaps just a bit on the high side depending on what you order. My dish is is the enchilada platter. It's surprising that really good Mexican food is so hard to find in the western GTA but El Sombrero's got it!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. The price is fairly reasonable, eeking just a bit to the high side but not enough to deter. My favorite is the enchilada platter (my usual Mexican dish). Really good Mexican food is surprisingly hard to find in the western GTA so El Sombrero is a real gem!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Mexican restaurants I ever tried..quality of food is below average,and prices are ridiculously high for what you are getting!Tried Wet burrito..had two bites and it was in the garbage bin!!!SIMPLY awful and bland..never again!!!"}
{"text":"So I've been here twice now ,
And I'm totally enjoying it ! 
Great authentic Mexican food .
I recommend the churros for a little extra sweet after your burrito or whatever tasty savoury dish you try ! 
The staff owner are very nice and always kind and willing to help with questions .
Great service and food .
Place could use a light Reno but makes it kids feel like your in Mexico lol !!! 
Give em a try for sure !"}
{"text":"Maybe I've been ruined by Taco Bell, but I found this place to be quite good! Visited here for dinner with three friends and we ordered:
- Fish tacos (good value, but pan-fried VS deep-fried)
- Wet burrito (HUGE and packed full, lots of rice, cheese was not melted on top)
- Chicken Quesadilla (good choice)
- Chili fries (great, but overpriced)

Service is good and fairly quick, affordable prices, though atmosphere reminds me more of a diner than Mexican restaurant. No wow factor, but it's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the GTA, in my opinon.  Blows \"Burrito Boyz\" out of the water.  Burrito Boyz has a menu consisting of literally 2 items:  Burritos, and quesadillas.  Considering they can't cook meat properly for either of them, I really don't understand what they've got going for themselves.  At El Sombrero at least you can get the real deal Tex-Mex/Mexican foods.  Enchiladas, tacos, wet burritos, fajitas, they have it all.  Not to mention their fried-daily nacho chips, bunelos (chocolate tortilla dessert), and chicken tacquitos are all amazing.  I have yet to be disappointed by any of the food here.  I think you will like it too. 

My recommendations:  Burrito (chicken), Tacquitos (chicken), Enchiladas, and Bunelos for dessert

The guy who owns the place is very friendly too and has even thrown in some free extras from time to time for being a regular, so this is definitely the kind of small Mom & Pop establishment that I love to support"}
{"text":"My experience is solely based on the food order i got thru one of the delivery companies, ordered the chilli cheese fries along with a steak burrito! The fries were heavenly and the portion could feed 2 easily, the burrito  on the other hand was gigantic. Too bad the rice was 98% of the filling along with some hints of cilantro if you imagined it to be there, would've liked more, sour cream barely there, beef, well let's just say in half a burrito i ate i felt maybe 3 chunks! Order the fries they are good, piping hot and flavourful but the burrito go to other competitors .  Did not see the location's inside yet. Can't vouch for seating, service etc"}
{"text":"Good food but a little in the pricey side. Not quite sure about authenticity but Portions are huge and can be shared most of the time. Complimentary chips and salsa are a nice touch. Good, quick service from the owner and staff. Will be back

Should have been four stars if not for the prices."}
{"text":"This was a cute spot. Went to lunch with a few friends. The patio was still open. It was busy but the line moved quickly. The staff were so nice. The food was also good. I had a chicken burrito. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and big tasty portions. Order a Mexican beer and try the excellent tortilla chips and salsa while you're waiting for your main course to arrive.
No Wi-Fi though--guess I'm used to seeing that wherever I go."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for more than 7 years and I can honestly say their wet burrito is the best burrito I've ever had! Their food is very flavorful is always fresh and the owners are the sweetest people I've ever met! There fries are so delicious sometimes I just go there just for that and of course their hot sauce they have so many different selections of hot sauce I can she was with your food it's incredible I know it's just a little thing but hey it's a pretty big deal for them to do that. 

I highly recommend this place if you are craving some burritos or tacos or maybe just some french fries that you want to munch on I promise you it will be better than McDonald's for sure"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and I  must tell you it has one of the best burritos I've tried.  The employees,  environment,  everything is excellent. Me and my boyfriend go there quite often thay they know exactly what we want to get now! I will highly recommend to try this place.  We get the wet burrito and sometimes their fries.  Their food is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Surprising to find excellent Mexican in a 'big-box' plaza in Mississagua. Don't judge a book by it's facade, this place is very good and authentic as it gets!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Nice size portions but it's expensive. Burrito and drink almost $14. And then they charge if you want a side of salsa. 
I could eat it every day but too rich for my blood."}
{"text":"There was a time when this place served some of THE BEST Mexican food you could find in the area. Sadly this is no longer the case and the food they now serve is sub-par at best. 

I ordered a \"Wet\" Burrito (my go-to at this place) and over the last few times, the quality of the food gradually got worse and worse. At one point I even tried the Naked Burrito and that too wasn't necessarily the best. The food was served lukewarm/cold and when I brought it up I was told \"The sauces make it cold\"; perhaps the owner should've listened to himself say that. Needless to say I wouldn't really recommend going here as the food certainly isn't worth it. The only thing that keeps people coming back is the fact that they are LLBO. 

Only reason I am giving them a two-star is because they give free Chips and Salsa with your order."}
{"text":"I've really enjoyed all my visits to El Sombrero, as it is some of the best Mexican food in Calgary (but that's always the qualifier: In Calgary). It has a great location on 17th Avenue, and the restaurant is just darling. I love the colourful, authentic decor, and the food was very tasty. I recently went for a friend's birthday and it was soo good. I had the fajitas which were very tasty, and stole other peoples  food too (as far as my taste tests went, everything is delicious). The staff were very friendly, and it just made it a fun night all around."}
{"text":"The food quality and service doesn't justify the price. I'd rather go to teriyaki next door. Good complimentary chips though!"}
{"text":"Small little place that surprises with the portion and yummy taste! I had a veggie enchilada and it was lovely! 

My friend had a steak sandwich and he said it was the best sandwich he's ever had with those lovely flavours. 

Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. I happened upon it tonight. Had the chicken burrito with chips and guacamole. The guacamole was decent could have used more cilantro. Great patio and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not what I joint it would be. The food was interesting. I have it a 3 cause I can't decide if I liked the food or not. It didn't have much taste! I had the \"Wet Burrito\". Which was a GIANT burrito smothered in a pasta style sauce. It has rice/beans/sour cream/peppers & some spice that didn't do it for me. 

What j can say good is the staff were smiling & helpful. Other than that not much more to add."}
{"text":"I came here on two occasions, once for dine-in with friends and another time for a quick take-out.  While I found the service to be friendly while waiting for friends at the bar, the actual ordering process is quite rushed and impersonal.  What I was expecting based on reviews was an authentic experience, good food and laid back atmosphere.  What I got both times were rushed service and sub par Mexican food.

Let's not kid ourselves, this is Mexican food for the masses, and while it is a good option for lunch, it is nothing to write home about.  They serve their food cafeteria style, which means they can never have any of that crunchy deep fried fish or chicken tacos, they don't offer hot sauce unless asked, their guacamole serving is 1 tsp per order.  Their taco shells are dry and tastes like the generic ones sold at local grocery stores.  I would go so far to say that Chipotle is a better lunch option."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place based on other reviews I had read.  Maybe it was just a bad night? But we didnt have the greatest meal here.

The staff weren't overly friendly when we arrived.  They shoved a container of chips and salsa at us as we approached the counter (menu is up high - you order at the counter then take a seat).  When we mentioned it was our first time in the restaurant one of the gentlemen \"kindly\" let me know most women order the taco salad..... 

Well, ask my husband, I am not most women :)  So I ordered the web burrito. I had read many good reviews so figured it was a good place to start.  The one good thing I will say is they let you mix and match fillings - so I had  a beef/chicken combo.  But all of the food is already prepared - they just slap it together and \"re-heat\" it.  Very little condiments (a sprinkling of cheese, sour cream and quacamole) but they were generous with the rice and meat.  It made the burrito seem very dry - even with the tomato sauce poured on top.  The spicing was tasty - and seemed more authentic then most places I have been in the city.

My husband had beef tacos. Three open flat soft tacos with 2 chunks of stew beef on each, a dab of sour cream and sprinkling of rice ... More of an appetizer than a meal. For fun we also had Mexican fries. Again the spicing was fantastic, but the addition of Velveeta as the cheese sauce was a bit of a disappointment.  Hard to find real Queso dip in the burbs.

Overall we weren't too excited about our meals, and probably wont go back.

The ambiance is great though and I can see how in summer, when the patio is open it could be a great quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"Second stop on my search of mexican food in Mississauga. This place has me pleasantly surprised.  This place is delicious and tastes authentic. I came here twice in one day. I work up the street and Im always looking for new foods to try and this place is definitely going to be on my list of lunch options. 

This place is a little hard to notice if you're jus driving by but not hard to get to once you know where it is. I ordered a chicken burrito both times. Once cause I ate it in the car and the second time cause I ate it at work and couldn't go back to work covered in burrito. The burrito was large and they only have one size.

The burrito was filling and tastey. I had mine with rice, chicken, jalapeños, a little bit of salsa, sour cream, and hot sauce. The chicken and rice alone were very favourable. The tortilla bread was super tasty and not an el del passo tortilla bread. I like that they pre-grilled it as it was tasty. All the ingredients looked and tasted fresh. 

The place is clean and has a large bar and a huge outdoor patio if you want to stay a while. It was pretty busy on the patio when I went. All in all a great mexican gem in Mississauga.

I will come back and hope to try the wet burrito. This place is a must try if you're a fan of mexican food.

Adios Amigos,"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places! I always get the chicken burrito as it's a staple and their chips are always a must-have.

Have introduced this place to over 10 people who have all been impressed and love the atmosphere and staff!

El Sombrero you are my go-to :)"}
{"text":"I went again - with another set of friends - and this time I ordered the tacos (soft).  I was able to get 1 chicken, 1 beef.  I liked the chicken better and 2 of them, no sides, was just the right amount for a \"lighter\" lunch!

(I also tasted a bit of the quesadilla - which I normally don't order - and it was yummy.  How could you go wrong with melted cheese in between a flour tortilla??)

So don't feel like you just hafta get a burrito, if you don't have the room for it.  

Note:  They do have a lunch rush, so keep that in mind.  A table opened up at the last minute, otherwise, we'd hafta eat outside!"}
{"text":"I agree that the food here is on the pricier side, but nothing majorly overpriced or anything. The tables need a SERIOUS scrub down. The other location was worse. The tables were so sticky I didn't want my arms or hands near them. I grabbed a napkin to try and wipe some off, and black reside came off, but it didn't help. That was kind of a flag for me, but you can see the food prep area as you order and it looked clean enough.
I ordered taquitos and nachos. I never got my taquitos, unfortunately, but they also didn't charge me for them. We ordered, told them what toppings we wanted, then we sat down. A man who I presume to be the manager brought cutlery and napkins to our table, though I saw some yelp reviewers remind us not to forget to bring some. He brought us about 6 napkins each and we needed them!!! The nachos were amazing. I had the nachos with chili and the chili was definitely the highlight, soooo sooo good.
We also did get tortilla chips and salsa prior to our meal, complimentary. I agree with others that the chips didn't taste super fresh, which was kind of disappointing. I have gone to chain tex-mex places and gotten hot, fresh tortilla chips so I would kind of expect it from a so-called authentic hotspot like this. The salsa itself was good but nothing extraordinary. The guacamole was chunky but far too onion-y for my taste. I'll skip it next time.
I will return here, probably for nachos. I'd love to try some chili cheese fries after tasting the amazing chili.

Side note: my friend got the enchiladas and they were good too, big portion, but she said she'll be getting nachos next time!"}
{"text":"One word: nachos. The chili makes it because it really is good.
Nothing fancy and not a huge menu, but I haven't met anyone yet who doesn't like El Sombrero."}
{"text":"I like this place. Everything is good. Little hole in the wall hide away.
Chilli is awesome. Wet burritos are fantastic.
It's all good."}
{"text":"I always love a good Mexican place. When my boyfriend and I first walked in we were welcomed and offered a basket of chips n salsa. The menu had about 12 items on it and they offered a variety of bottled soft drinks on the side n water jugs on the side for water. 

I ordered fish tacos and my boyfriend got the tex Mex burger. The fish tacos were good but my boyfriend def enjoyed his burger.

{"text":"Visited this place on lunch.  Very busy, but I was completely turned off by the lack of personal hygiene.

For me, any place where someone is handling food they should be wearing gloves.  If not, this is completely unacceptable.

The person making the burritos had no gloves on and I saw her cough on her hands, wipe it on her shirt and continue to make someone's order.  Gross! 

I left and will never be returning here again."}
{"text":"It's too bad the service is lacking, because the food isn't half-bad... I had a wet burrito via UberEats, which was by no means authentic, but packed full of flavour.

But this place went wrong when they 1) did not include utensils (despite explicitly requesting them) - sending me on a scavenger hunt for cutlery and therefore defeating the purpose of ordering delivery (read: trying to save time), 2) took the liberty of substituting Muscle Milk for Gatorade (which is NOT the same thing - plus Muscle Milk tastes disgusting), and 3) substituting Pepsi for Ginger Ale."}
{"text":"It's a decent joint. The portions are good for the prices. We ordered the enchilada and wet burrito dish, along with the chili con carne. They tasted like how they should, just nothing mind blowing. I'd come back here, if I was around the area- not my go-to place though for burritos. The staff were really friendly and all smiles."}
{"text":"Thanks to the reviews below, I stopped by and had one of the wet burritos. Absolutely fantastic. Add to that a house margarita and I was stuffed."}
{"text":"Ok yes it's one of the more \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants around.  I found the taste to be good not great. What I don't like is that my burrito tortilla was pre grilled. I know they're busy but lets not cut corners el SOMBERO. Nothing outstanding with my wet burrito and at $12 I kinda felt shorted

Granted my wife's steak taco was delicious. 

Free chips no salsa. Maybe I should of asked. 

If I've never been to cancun, Chicago and San Francisco and tried \"real\" tacos I'd be more impressed. 

I'd tell them to lower their price but they were busy when I was there so obviously they're doing something right."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while staying in Brampton. It's an authentic Mexican place with a big menu. Everything we had was delicious and there was a great selection of hot sauces. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious Mexican food in Mississauga! 
Stopped by after a meeting with a few co-workers on a whim. I ordered the beef tacos. The ladies working the counter were very confident that there was no flour used in the meats, toppings, etc. The tortillas used for the tacos were corn. They were AMAZING! The beef tasted like shredded steak in the most delicious sauce, and it was topped with fresh salsa, guac, and sour cream. It the meal comes with two tacos for $7.99 and you leave feeling full (but not uncomfortably so) sleepy and satisfied! My idea of a good meal - though maybe not when I still have to work after, haha. 
I did get a gluten reaction, which was my own fault. The corn tortillas are heated on the same grill as the flour tortillas. This was my own stupidity and lack of knowledge of just how sensitive I am to gluten. Next time I'd just request my tortillas to not be warmed on the grill. Oh yes, there will be a next time!! 
One of my co-workers got the burrito and it was massive! She took half home for dinner that night. My other colleague got the chicken tacos and also enjoyed them immensely. 
Go here and eat your heart out! You won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican food in sauga!! If you are looking for some good ol' burritos, you've found the right place. The moment you walk in, you'd think that you would be at a fast food kind of restaurant, but the formats a little different. You pay after you consume your meal, which I found it a bit odd...but it seems to be the norm here.

We ordered the regular chicken burrito without beans and jalapeños and beef fajitas. We highly recommend the beef...the taste was just majestic. The flank steak they use is amazing. Perfectly marinated and juicy enough to know that you aren't getting some frozen packaged filling. The onions were a bit on the greasy side but rice was prepared perfectly and seasoned and so was the guacamole. 

I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken burrito and seriously think, this might be my new go-to for Mexican food around the west end of the GTA!!"}
{"text":"Ive been on the hunt for a good local fish taco and so far nothing.
I came to this place as its really close to work.
I ordered fish tacos..it was 10$ for two.
When ordering she did not tell me they use samon(frm a can) but i guess i should hve asked -_-
She asks if i want special sauce..i ask whats in it.its mustard ketchup and mayo mixed together ..what???
So i pick up the taco to eat it and its so soggy that the whole thing falls apart.
It has absolutely no flavor except the cilantro in my pico de gallo...
Worse food ever.
The place is quite dirty as well i should hve know better.
Definitely will not return!!!
Not sure how they got these ratings"}
{"text":"Our team at work continues to go out for lunch every Friday. This week, we headed over to El Sombrero.

It was the second week that we went to a Mexican eatery. My manager used a random generator to determine which restaurant we go to each week. Because we were doing Mexican again, only three of us said yes to going out.

I drove my colleague and manager over to the restaurant. It's in a fairly quiet strip mall. Getting there was fairly straightforward. I drove along Matheson Boulevard, and then turned north along Hurontario. I then turned onto Brunel Road and was there.

We got there at noon. It was busy. We lined up, with my reserving a table for us with my coat and hat. My colleague placed his scarf down on the table.

I had the enchiladas. I got to choose the type of meat and went with chicken. You get chunks of chicken. The lunch comes with black beans and rice. It was so filling and tasty. I think that the sodium could have been reduced and the beans didn't need feta cheese. The enchiladas were smothers in shredded cheese. The food was delicious.

My manager had the lentil soup and soft fish tacos. I love fish tacos that are grilled and are not fried in some batter. They looked good. The fish appeared to be salmon. He enjoyed his food.

My colleague got the Mex burger. I love burgers with guacamole. He liked his burger. He also let us have some of his fries. I normally don't like fries, but they were good. 

This restaurant is a nice family-run business. Everyone taking our orders and getting our food to us were helpful, hard-working, and friendly.

The restaurant is fairly small. There is a bar area. In the summertime, I am sure that there are more places to sit when the patio is open.

I will come back to sample more dishes. Perhaps I will do takeout one evening.

{"text":"So disappointed. Started out great - authentic hispanic people working there. Ended badly. Ordered the stuffed peppers w/cheese - ended up having CHICKEN in them. Was jazzed about \"homemade\" taco chips, but they were stale...the BF had a chicken mole which he said was alright. Both mains arrived barely lukewarm. We each received 1 drink and were never asked if we would like another...waited over 20 minutes to get our bill while the bartender just \"stood\" there. 

The food was sub-par Mexican, as far as authentic (read: Mexico) Mexican goes. Portions were large but the \"cooked veggies\" and \"salad\" sides were prepared too far in advance and were both limp and barely palatable. I noted everyone was waiting. 

Cute interior, decently friendly staff. Bad food, served cold and you couldn't get a buzz on in there if you tried. 

Really too bad."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I grew up in Mississauga and I didn't know about this place. I don't want to get ahead of myself because I only tried one thing on the menu but I feel it in my gut that this place has real promise! 

I was on my way home and craving a burrito. I remembered I booked marked this place on yelp so I decided to find it. When I walked through the front door the first thing I noticed was how delicious it smelled in there. I felt like I was at my friends house and their parents were in the middle of making dinner. I immediately got excited. The place is super cute (my kind of restaurant). Warm, welcoming and casual. 

I ordered the wet burrito and a mango jurrito to wash it down. The burrito is huge. I eat A LOT and even I couldn't finish it. It was filled with rice, cheese, sour cream, guacamole, chunks of seasoned beef, salsa and beans. They topped it with warm salsa and cheese. It was all seasoned to perfection. They have a variety of hot sauces to choose from if you like it spicy. My only complaint is there wasn't enough sour cream and guacamole for me. Next time I will order extra on the side. But overall good food! next time I go back I want to dine in."}
{"text":"It is probably unfair to come here shortly after my trip down to San Diego right on the Mexican border.  This is a mom and pop Tex Mex place that caters to the masses ... especially the commercial biz lunch crowd.  I've heard the place can go from nothing to insanely busy within a short time.  Late afternoon is a siesta pace.

The atmosphere is worn and weary in a bright splash of a reddish walls.  The menu is a tired looking huge poster hanging near the ordering area.  The prices are fair for the amount of food you get.  Sure it's more than your typical fast food place but the larger portions and better flavours make it a better value.

Like most mom and pop places, the food is homey and not necessarily good looking.  It looks barely beyond cafeteria food but I do give it props for using some good chunks of chicken in a Chicken Quesadilla.  The quesadilla was heated but not crisp... just an overall soft and warmish flattened burrito.  There was some decent amount of cheese and the salsa helped bring some flavour to this.  I did find the chicken to be dried out but at least it was good pieces of chopped chicken.  3.5/5

I wouldnt say this is good Tex Mex but for Mississauga, it might be the only option.  At least you wont go home hungry."}
{"text":"i wanted roti but they aren't open on weekends. coincidentally, i was sitting right in front of El Sombrero and knew it must've been fate.

there was a poster with enchiladas that was just making my mouth drool, but i ended up ordering burritos for myself and my coworker.

i ordered a chicken burrito and a beef burrito with all toppings. and it came to $22 and change.

we ended up cutting both burritos in half just so we cold try both chicken and beef.

these are some pretty big burritos, people. delicious, but big. i managed to scarf them down pretty quickly. and within moments of finishing my meal, i was ready to pass the f out.

i can't say i was very productive at work afterwards.

although it's quite pricey, i will go back and try some of the other menu items eventually."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, decent prices and awesome food...my coworkers turned me on here for lunch once and I've been back multiple times and friends I've brought in and moved away still crave their burritos."}
{"text":"Great customer service, very friendly staff. It was our first time there and the average interior didn't impress us at first but food was really good. We got a wet burrito and enchiladas as they were recommended by others, here on yelp. Both were awesome dishes and we definitely enjoyed it much more then expected. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price.  I like the ambiance and sometimes you get people singing.  Whenever I go I like to get the house special and get surprised as to what the special of the day is.  It has always been good.

The drinks are strong and they have arguably the best margaritas in town.

I would've given 5 stars if the washroom was a bit cleaner and/or they renovated a bit."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying if you want to run a restaurant you need to have quality and customer services as your main priority and this location has by far the worst customer service. 

Initially i called the store to see if they delivered or not the woman who answered the phone didnt know anything, she had to ask the rude store owner. she started off by saying they dont deliver for 2 people then passed the phone to the manager who was very rude and in a rush. i understand this was peak lunch time but the way he was speaking to me was beyond rude. His response to my question is \"minimum order must be $100, okay i cant talk now im busy bye..\" at this point i was already furious. I decided to go online and order my food and pick it up instead, i ordered and paid for the food online and when i got to the store which had a really long line up i checked my email and it said the order went through then a few minutes later another email that said your order was rejected. 
at this point i was furious and just left the restaurant to eat elsewhere. a few minutes later i called back the store to ask why my order was rejected and the same useless cashier that answered the phone didnt know why it got rejected and transferred me to the manger. I asked him why did you reject my order his response was exactly this \"i have the right to reject your order, i am really busy\" then i said but its not my problem if you are busy i made an order for a pick up and im not asking for a delivery? why would you reject my order??!! , i wasted my lunch break on this monkey i mean manager and this asshole had no good reason to reject my order. BUT WAIT THERES MORE! , after telling this guy off and making fun of his dirty mustache and his poor management skills i closed the phone. 30 seconds later he called me back and said \"sorry, i thought you were someone else, i thought you were the delivery company\" I told him this is how you deal with people?? im a customer and you just reject my order and im supposed to take your excuse ? this is bullshit, f*** you and your f**ked up restaurant, his stupid reply was \"come back in and have what ever you like its a mistake i thought you were someone else thats why i had to reject and we are really busy\" i told him i dont care what you thought thats not my f**ing problem you reject a customer from service before verifying who you were rejecting, im not coming back there dont waste my time\" and hung up the phone on his face. 

i understand there are peak times at restaurants and thats why i went through the trouble of picking up but never in my life did i have such poor customer service from a restaurant owner because hes too f**king stingy to hire another one or two workers. he chose to provide poor customer service. i hope this locations gets shut down. The food is amazing but the service is questionable. i don't recommend this location what so ever."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch during a business trip to the Mississauga area the other day and was very pleasantly surprised. A small, quaint, family run place serving up some amazingly good authentic Mexican food. The restaurant itself is not too big and nothing too special to look at, and when you get in it's a walk up and order, get your food, then sit down and eat type of deal. The prices are not overly outrages but not too cheap either. The portion sizes on the other hand are more than generous and massively big, I ordered a wet burrito and it was so big I could hardly eat it all, but oh man was it ever good. I mean we're talking the real deal Mexican here, the flavours were amazing and not to mention the homemade tortilla chips, they were so good that I just had to ask for a bag of them to take home with me! Great family run business serving up some great authentic Mexican in a plaza full of ethnic food choices, but if you have to choose one, I suggest you go to El Sombrero for some of the best food around."}
{"text":"As good as Buritto Boyz !! Maybe better !! 

I work very close to El Sombrero and constantly order to pick up from them. The Burittos are heavy and very very good. The people that work there are very friendly and the prices are not too bad. Guocamoli is probably the best I have had anywhere. I recommend the Steak Buritto and the garlic chips with Guoc. They also serve beer and have a small sized area to sit and eat. During the summer they have a patio that is nice to stop in and have a beer and buritto. I would have to say the difference between this and Buritto boyz isnt much about the same size and taste. But if your ever close to El Sombrero and hungry go grab some food ...it wont dissapoint. If you want something that is a little different but tastes amazing, try the Wet Burrito ...just amazing.

Everything that I have had from El Sombrero has been great. The Chili is amazing also. If I have a choice between Burrito Boyz and ElSombrero ....I will take El Sombrero any day of the week. 

By the way ...the Wet Burrito will put you to sleep, so be careful. LOL. This is my Favorite spot for Mexican food. So far nothing compares."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place often and I recalled some tasty meals here a few years back. 

Unfortunately my meal here two days ago was not as enjoyable as I recalled those previous ones to be.

I ordered chicken nachos for take out. I was shocked to discover later the cheese was the thick, goopy baseball stadium style processed cheese. Very disappointing they didn't use proper shredded cheese and stick it on the oven as with most restaurants. 

The \"fresh\" guacamole was haphazardly mixed leaving large uneven chunks of avocado. Feta cheese doesn't belong on nachos and the chicken was scarce. All in all the worst nachos I've had at a Mexican restaurant. 

On the positive side the staff is super friendly, prices are reasonable, it's licensed, and the other dishes looked more promising.

I'll go back but not for the nachos."}
{"text":"I like Mexican food very much, and I'm satisfied by this wet beef burrito"}
{"text":"Reminded us of Monterey. Mexican music in the background and perfectly complemented decor compensated for the lack of space inside. Food is really nice and fresh. We ordered the chicken quesadilla and wet burrito. They have a patio , I would like to visit in the Summer months if in the area."}
{"text":"El Sombrero is THE place to enjoy Mexican food in Calgary.

And I am saying here - enjoy, not \"get\". If you just drop in to grab some burritos from those foreign dudes, that's ok, but you will miss all the rest. Maybe you will even be annoyed by the lack of attention, but trust me - that is something completely reciprocal.

Let's imagine you are entering the place, looking at everyone top-down, expecting the staff to jump around you and give you the best... Hmmm you know, I guess that won't happen. They shouldn't necessary be rude, depending on your own attitude, but you won't enjoy, for sure.

Now let's imagine that you are dropping in with a bunch of friends, apparently knowing who's that gal on the photo, and why those funny ornaments and decorations on the walls, and smile cheerful, and greet the waiter, the kitchen dude, the bar dude - and overall embrace the whole place like it is your own home! Just don't be fake - believe in what you are doing, and you will be astounded by results.

How about getting a \"reserved\" table immediately freed especially for you and your friends, because it provides the most comfortable seating? Some free coffee? Bigger portions? Lots of smiles and lightning-fast and cheerful service? A guy with a guitar singing a song for you and your girlfriend? And all that for a price of a smile and mutual respect, not a tip (though a tip will be appreciated)?

You can get it all in El Sombrero, just open yourself and be a friend, not a customer. So easy for some of us, so difficult for many others... I guess that may be a great difference in releasing oneself from the boundaries of one culture to embrace another - and get twice more for your soul.

Just in case - the food is great and authentic. Yes you can get something more expensive and elaborated in some other places, but what you'll get served in El Sombrero is a real stuff, and really good. And Corona is not the only \"Mexican beer\" out there, feel free to check out the rest of them.

And smile. You will get smiles in return. :-)

Oh, and \"a guy with a guitar\" name is Rigoberto Carrabajal. Many of the songs you'll hear are his own compositions, and pretty cute - especially if you know Spanish."}
