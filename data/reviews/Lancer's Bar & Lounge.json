{"text":"We went there a few months ago on a visit to Cleveland.  We were told that across the street was where it used to be before the fire but I can't confirm the location.  I can tell u the fish was amazing! I just went somewhere and spent more than twice as much and it still didn't match it.  There was a calm classy atmosphere and a jukebox & bar."}
{"text":"Lancer's was the best and most memorable feature of a trip to Cleveland.  First, the cab driver refused to take us.  The concierge seconded the driver's assessment that Lancer's neighborhood was Sadr City redux.  You know the types: close-cropped hair and tight fitting skulls.  We arrived to find people driving Volvos and Jeeps.  Everyone at the restaurant (besides us) had on at least a jacket.  Tie clips and fedoras and porkpies in profusion.  No matter our sloppy attire.  We were served promptly and attentively.  We ordered two seafood specials.  The waitress had to rearrange our table and clear our bread plates to get everything to fit on the table.  We'd been served enough seafood, in other words, to fill the hold of a small trawler.  Thrown atop the golden mount of were two frog legs each.  After eating for about 11 hours, we'd made it to the point where we could nearly see the plate below.  The food was so delicious that we encouraged ourselves with false bravado that we might, in fact, finish.  When the waitress came to clear our plates (\"Not too hungry, Daddy?\"), we managed a few more bites.  I don't recall wanting to take food again until about 7:45 PM the next night.  What a fun place.  A great bar on one side.  Good steak and seafood in the dining room.  And a motor inn out back.  America used to excel at this genre."}
