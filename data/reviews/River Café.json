{"text":"We recently tried this place while visiting Calgary, for the ScotiaBank marathon.  ...I'll start on a positive note - the setting in Prince Island Park was beautiful! The menu/food and service....not so much.  I left the place starving, as there were limited options for a vegetarian palate.  I was hoping for a large, green salad (without meat, cheese or anything sugary).  The 'only' green salad option they offered was the Heritage Greens - which was a tiny bowl of ingredients that were 'fluffed' to almost nothing - for $14!  Since this item fell under the appetizer heading I had originally requested the restaurant to make this an entree-sized salad (of course charging me accordingly) to which the waiter replied 'no can do'.  ...After slowly chewing my way through this strange tasting bowl of fluff I was glad that I did receive an entree sized portion.  Maybe it was the bee pollen that offered the bitter and gritty flavor, but I would not order it again. I sat for a very long time with an empty water glass, until finally my husband decided to share his with me, hoping the waiter would be back soon to refresh our glasses (which did not happen for another long while) - until he came back to offer dessert options, which we declined. So it was really too late to be finally refreshing our water (especially mine) - as our check came soon-after. This presented another surprise - the other couple had ordered an appetizer, some raw bison thing - which obviously I did not eat, being vegetarian.  Well, without asking us, our waiter split the appetizer cost - adding half to our bill!  ...We were with friends, but we have not known them for long so this created a VERY awkward situation to say the least.  I think my husband may have had 1 small bite of this raw, meat-eaters appetizer, but was in no way planning to pay for half of the $18 appetizer, for that 1 taste.  ...It did get very awkward, but I asked aloud why we were being charged for half of the app, however the waiter dropped our checks off quickly, heading off to another table and didn't ask if the bills looked okay to us. Well our friend's wife awkwardly offered to give my husband cash.  ...Why couldn't the waiter ask first how we wanted the bill split up?  It would have saved a very awkward moment for us with our friends. Once we left, we ended up dropping the other couple off at our B&B and headed out to run some errands.  I told my husband, I know this probably sounds weird, but I really am hungry and would like to try and find a to-go salad while we are out.  He graciously understood, but I think it's terrible that we paid $14 for a tiny bowl of 'fluff' (and I do mean fluff) and I am still hungry. I did pick something up to eat & brought it back to our B&B and kind of again 'awkwardly' explained that I was still hungry.  I was surprised to hear from the other couple that they too were also hungry, even after having bread, an appetizer and full entrees!  ...Wow!  This shocked me and I said, if you guys are still hungry imagine how hungry I am. Sad to report that even with the beautiful setting at the River Cafe, I would NOT recommend this pricy place with little to no options for vegetarians, hit and miss service that caused us awkward times with our friends and every one of us leaving hungry. Try another restaurant!  ....You can always check out, walk & enjoy Prince Island Park for free, without handing over your hard-earned $$$ for this type of experience."}
{"text":"The perfect blend of river city view, wonderful food and a courteous and professional staff. We were fortunate to be out on the patio on a perfect summer evening, but they do have plenty of propane heaters and the view is very nice.  Nice casual dress is appropriate, although a formal dinner would work here too.  Pricey, but the fresh and creative menu is certainly worth the cost. Park or walk over the bridge from downtown. Lovely."}
{"text":"Great place in the middle of the park.  It's really good for brunch and it's probably a good idea to make a reservation ahead of time, especially for weekend brunches.  the homemade yogurt is really good!"}
{"text":"Regional cuisine in a lovely spot on Prince's Island. Sunday brunch delight: Fish & Game Board, including Duck Prosciutto, Candied Trout, Salt Cured Bison, Sylvan Star Gouda, Duck Paté, Ling Cod Lox, House Pickles, Brassica Mustard, House Made Crackers (serves 2)   Or, if you're having a miserable day, and the weather's a disappointment, sit inside looking out at the park, enjoying a glass of port or something new from their extensive wine list."}
{"text":"My first time at River Cafe, and the location is great. I had the beef special and apple cobbler for dessert. My companions all lived their choices which included the bison. I only had 1 concern. at the recommendation of our waitress we picked the organic Pinot noir which was awful, thankfully the manager allowed us to switch to a different wine, at no charge. Good was great as was the service, if you are willing to pay a few extra bucks for supper this is a good choice."}
{"text":"I'm new to Calgary, and I had to walk along Prince Island Park. I came in on the afternoon, by myself and perhaps a little underdressed. Casually.  They must've been busy because I felt neglected, I would ask for tea and no milk or sugar cane with it. I had to ask. Took 20 minutes for the server to come with milk and sugar. I asked for water, every table was asked for water except me. So I had to ask for water, and it took them another 20 minutes to get water. I wasn't checked up on, and had to wave the servers down.  I didn't feel welcomed. I feel like I shouldn't have come at all. The two stars are for the good weather and that the cake came at all."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  The service is always amazing but the food leaves a lot to be desired.  I would go back just because of the location."}
{"text":"We go back every year for our Anniversary.  This year we got a better seat (by the window near the fireplace) and it was really nice.  A lot less waiter/ess traffic.  The meal was good and the atmosphere / views are wonderful.  We will be back in 2016."}
{"text":"Very good food, Great Wine list, very nice location"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I came here on a beautiful evening and sat on the patio. It is in such a lovely area of the city.   We had scallops and oysters to start and both were so delicious and fresh tasting. For my entree, I had the tuna. BEST TUNA I HAVE EVER HAD! The meal was sooooooooo incredibly delicious with the perfect combination of flavours and the portion size was just right. This, along with a fresh Pimms to drink, made the entire experience so yummy!   The restaurant is definitely on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for and this place has some good quality food! I definitely recommend this for a date night or when you are wanting to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and myself have been here a few times but our last experience really impressed me. We had reservations and the restaurant was very busy so they took an extra few minutes to seat us, but it was worth it. We sat on the patio and had a beautiful view of the city as the sun set. The staff was very knowledgeable of their food and took an extra few moments to explain what everything was as the put it on the table. The waitress was very pleasant and attentive even though she had many other tables, as well as she surprised us with a small plate of hand rolled truffles to celebrate our anniversary that night. Over all, while pricey this place is worth it, delicious food, great atmosphere and wonderful staff, make this place a must try for anyone in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have been to Calgary so many times and I don't know how I missed enjoying the cuisine in this remarkable and unique restaurant. Located on an island in the middle of the Bow River and steps from downtown.  Fresh locally sourced products are combined into culinary treats that make you want to eat slowly and enjoy the food, drink, dessert, friendly and knowledgable service in an extremely comfortable environment. The menu is well thought out to be slightly different but using very familiar ingredients served picture perfect--and delicious. The wine and drink list is not overwhelming but more than adequate. Everything works and combines for a memorable evening not to be missed. We will be back."}
{"text":"Up The River... - River Cafe is perplexing, it has a wonderful location and setting. The cuisine is sometimes innovative and almost always very good. The service, however, is so inconsistent, leaning way more often toward bad than good. The servers there appear aloof and arrogant; as if it's YOUR PRIVILEGE to be SERVED BY THEM. Perhaps it is the uniqueness and solitary honor of being the only restaurant in Prince's Island Park that engenders this deplorable attitude. You'd think they were serving at Tavern On The Green in Central Park. That bastion of NYC dining, however, has even closed, so smarten up River Cafe or you may be headed for the same fate."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the River Café many times for special occasions (anniversaries, birthdays, etc).  For several years this restaurant has been one of our go-to places for a nice meal.  Unfortunately a recent experience has changed our opinion of the River Café.  We decided it would be a great idea to order one of the River Cafe's picnic baskets and have a picnic lunch in Prince's Island Park.  We ordered a day in advance (as required by the restaurant), and picked up our picnic basket a little after noon the following day.  We found a bench in the park and started in on our lunch (the food was great - I'll give credit where credit is due).  Unfortunately about 10 minutes after we sat down in the park, the weather took a turn.  The clouds rolled in, the wind picked up, and it got downright cold.  Not Calgary winter cold, but cold and windy enough that you wouldn't want to be sitting outside to eat your lunch.  We promptly packed up and headed back to the restaurant to ask if we could sit down at a table inside to enjoy the rest of our lunch.  I was shocked when we were told that we were not allowed in the restaurant.  We were told \"picnic baskets are for take-out only\".  If the restaurant had been full, I would have completely understood.  I estimate that the place was 20% full - there were plenty of empty tables, and the lunch rush was over by this time.  I also understand that having a picnic basket sitting on a table doesn't exactly scream \"high-end restaurant\", and that they are trying to uphold a certain image.  This seemed to be the main sticking point for them.  To resolve this, I asked if they could simply take the picnic basket to the kitchen and plate the food.  This seemed like an easy fix - arrange the food nicely on a couple plates, and the restaurant doesn't have to worry about an unsightly picnic basket on their table.  Furthermore, their customers get to stay warm and eat in comfort.  I was told this wouldn't be possible.  Needless to say we left the River Café absolutely fuming.  I understand that the picnic baskets are meant to be a take-out lunch, but management should use common sense when enforcing their policies around this program.  When a customer pays $70 for a take-out lunch and asks to come inside when the weather turns, they should be welcomed into the restaurant if there are available tables.  This whole experience has completely ruined our impression of the River Café.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try the River Cafe for a long time for their seasonal fare and the location.   The Good: The ambiance is phenomenal. It's like a little cottage nestled in the heart of the park and it's especially pretty with a winter/Christmas feel. You can't beat the location.   The food was also mostly quite good. We shared the fish and game board to start (24). The housemade crackers were a nice touch and they had a delicious buttery taste. For dinner I had the Noble Farms Duck Breast (42)  and my husband had the 'Bite' Beef Tenderloin (46). The dishes were all enjoyable and well-presented.   The service was average. A hint of pretension but attentive service overall. Waters were kept topped off and we didn't wait too long.  The Bad: It's the little details. Plates that are too big for the size of the tables so that every plate being delivered feels a bit treacherous (make sure you duck and get ready to move your cutlery). A miniscule pat of butter along with the bread to serve four people (is there a butter shortage I'm not aware of?) The Pecan Butter Tart (11) for dessert was really only so-so. It was overcooked and dry, I had a hard time breaking it into pieces with just my fork. (If you wish you had a knife, it's probably not a great tart). And finally, River Cafe, when I pay $180 for a two-person meal it'd be nice to have a mint or something along with the cheque. Even a tiny chocolate mint to sweeten the blow a little!   The Ugly: This one is entirely on me, but don't wear heels. There is no parking nearby and you will have to walk about ten minutes from your car to the restaurant itself in the park.   Overall, River Cafe is an experience worth having. Go with your sweetie or family for a special occasion and if the price tag is a bit much for you, skip appetizers, go for one of the delicious main meals and have a few housemade truffles (3 ea) with a hot beverage. Linger and soak up the atmosphere because it truly is a lovely restaurant with great surroundings."}
{"text":"This is my first trip to Calgary. I'm staying at the Sheraton Suites which is very close to this restaurant. This place is amazing and so good! I don't find Canadian food to be particularly creative but the menu on this place is so unique and good. The trout is great, so many flavors mixed that make it an amazing choice. I also had the rice pudding which is prepared with wild rice. Again, unique and different. This is a must place if you're planning a visit to Prince's Island Park."}
{"text":"WOW let me start by saying I absolutely love this place. I love the little walk through the park I took to get here. I love the outdoor landscaping I love the indoor ambiance. This place is somewhere I would come to chill and I haven't even gotten to the food!   The food WOW. The chef has taken the time to really express himself through the menu. It's fun to read it's exciting it makes your mouth water. Let me tell you I had a tough time deciding what to get! They have a great deal of local & wild meats on the menu but I decided to go vegetarian. I was not disappointed. I got the Heritage Grain 'Lasagna'. Deconstructed joy, a unique tasty dish packed with flavor. I like mushrooms I like tomatoes I like sorrel. The vegetables really shone in this dish perfectly cooked you can taste each individual flavor. This is nowhere near your typical lasagna (hence the quotation marks). There's no slop of tomato sauce and cheese. This is a very light healthy take on the dish. I really enjoyed it.   Because I liked my meal so much I decided to get dessert. (I only like really good desserts.) I ordered the Rhubarb and Mint Panna Cotta. Again WOW the presentation was so beautiful I did not want to eat it (but I did). Delicious ! The Panna Cotta was perfectly set, light and creamy. The Rhubarb shone through tangy and sweet & there was the slightest hint of mint. The hard caramel on top gave the dish a nice textured crunch.   Please enjoy with all your senses this beautiful place!"}
{"text":"Appetizers Smoked albacore tuna with Wildboar prosciutto, apple, citrus gel pumpkin seeds $14. Nice starter with a delicious mix of flavours.   White Gold Burrata - confit carrots, garlic cream, pickled garlic scape, Crostini $14. Enjoyed by my wife. Confit carrots were especially good.   Fish and game board -  Bison Breseola, candied salmon, steelhead lox, Wildboar Ciccioli, Bison chorizo, Wild boar prosciutto, Old West ranch buffalo mozzarella, chicken liver pate, Edgar farm asparagus, birch syrup marinated olives, house made crackers $30. Interesting starter but not my favourite. Candied salmon was very good.   Red lentils hummus - canola seed flatbread, roasted garlic, preserved tomato $14. The flatbread is fluffy similar to Naan bread. My favourite appetizer. The roasted garlic blended nicely with the fresh Hummus.   Grilled Humboldt squid and pork belly with kimchi Aioli, roast potato $21 The squid was moderate. It goes well with the kimchi aioli. The pork belly was very good. Broccolini was nicely cooked.   Small Wonder Squash with onion Brulée, Swiss chard, chanterelle and hazelnut $19 My wife thought it was pretty good, but not superb. The hazelnuts were nice. Good flavour to the squash.   Service Very good service.  Always attentive and happy to take our photo.   Value Fair value for the food or service."}
{"text":"My wife and I participated in the MS Walk and decided it was the perfect opportunity to give the famous River Cafe a try.  What a beautiful spot and a great ambience.  We were greeted by a couple friendly hostesses and shown to an indoor table as the patio was full.  We got a great spot by the window that opened, so a great compromise. The experience.  The menu did not have a lot of lunch options (brunch was the focus of the day) and the ones that were offered were somewhat difficult to figure out.  Frustrated I ordered the bison burger and my wife had the flatbread.  The food came quickly enough (wasn't busy) but that is where it all went awry.  The bison burger was small yet I could not finish it as there was a strange flavour to it that made it sickening after a while.  The potato salad that accompanied it was good. The flat bread was not good.  There must have been something wrong with it as it had a sweet but pungent smell (and taste) to it.  We are not ones to complain but when the server finally returned (no quality check, and did not see her until we were done with the place) my wife mentioned it was a little weird. The server did concur that something seemed off and promptly took the item off the bill which was appreciated, but also expected as it was not edible. Overall I am glad we went because we had been wondering about this place but I would be very hesitant to go back."}
{"text":"I'm a total foodie and love to indulge in a nice fine dining experience here and there.   I was pretty disappointed with my brunch experience at River Cafe.  I ordered the yogurt and granola and also the bison bacon Benedict.   The yogurt and granola was ok. I prefer greek yogurt to the soupy yogurt they served. The portion was tiny and the granola lacked the \"crunch\" I prefer. They served it with thinly sliced plum or nectarine wedges. It was hard to tell which because they were clearly under-ripe and very tart. Not adding a lot of sweetness to the plain yogurt. I prefer plain, unsweetened yogurt because I try to avoid sugar. However, I like to add fresh fruit...their underripe selections did little to offset the tartness.   The Benedict was interesting. It was served on a biscuit which I thought lacked tender, buttery flakiness that I look for. I can bake a better biscuit than I had here. The bacon was delicious. The hollandaise was delicious and tart from the lemon. The side of potatoes were un-browed and undercooked. They weren't hard...just lacking and crust and flavor punch. I asked to have them re-served and she got me a fresh plate of browned potato hash that WAS delicious....I just don't feel like I should have to ask. The eggs were poached and cooked medium. I wonder if they actually poach their eggs in boiling water or if they use some other device....not sure on that one. But I've had better poached eggs than that.   The coffee was TERRIBLE.....I could barely drink it.   Overall, overpriced, meh experience. Fine dining is expensive and I'm ok with that, but only if I eat food of unsurpassed quality. I felt the value, quality and attention to detail here was lacking. I won't be back.   Service was ok. Ambiance in the park is beautiful....but the interior chairs and tables leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"3 of us went for brunch ($90 with tip) and it was really nice.  The location is beautiful, it has a rustic feel like a cabin in the woods.  The service was good.  We each had something different, I had a fritata which was served with squash and chantrelle mushrooms on the side...I have to say I wasn't crazy about the mushrooms and the squash seemed quite basic.  I ordered a side of hashbrowns, they were very tasty but just barely warm.  My husband had the eggs benny with heirloom tomatoes and said they were good, but he wasn't very impressed with the house made ketchup.  My daughter had french toast, I think it had white chocolate and stewed plums...I had a taste and it was delicious!  However she did say that by the end the sweet factor was a bit much.  She also ordered a side of turkey sausage which was very good, but I was suprised to see that it was only one sausage.  I would like to try the River Cafe again, but I have to say that there is just something about being charged for water that really offends me.  Oh well..."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time and I can see why. It is consistently a great dining experience. My sweetie took me here for my birthday and as always it was a treat. Our server was friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents for father's day.  The restaurant was about three-quarters full. We ordered appetizers, including the beet salad and the duck risotto. Both appetizers were very good.  However, this is where things fell apart. After our appetizers were taken away, we waited over a full hour for the mains to be served. After 45 minutes, we started asking why it was taking so long and learned that apparently the kitchen was backed up. On father's day, with a less than full restaurant.   Things went from bad to worse. When the meal showed up, my mom's short rib was cold. I don't mean it was room temperature; the outside was, but the inside was the temperature of a refrigerator. Clearly, they had taken it out of the refrigerator, either not microwaved it long enough or simply forgot to cook it, and put it on the plate.   My dad had ordered the lamb tourtiere, which is essentially a meat pie. When it arrived, we noticed that the side of the pie facing up (not the top part, which was crusted as it should be) had totally dried out, parts of the meat were crunchy. Obviously, it had been sitting under the heat lamb for a very long period of time.  I had the salmon and it was quite good, so I guess that's one out of three.  Some caveats: our server was very nice and the restaurant did take steps to rectify the meal. Indeed, the service was actually quite good and managed to salvage the second star you see above.  Regardless, you don't expect to pay $45 for an entree to have meat straight out of a refrigerator or food that has dried out underneath a heat lamp; nor do you expect to wait 1 hour plus for this pleasure when the restaurant is not even full."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Our reservation was at 7:30pm but the table wasn't ready until 8:15pm. They comped our appetizer platter and drinks only after one member of our party suggested they do so. Our wine order took about 20 minutes to arrive to our table from the bar which was 2 feet away... I ordered the organic chicken breast meal. The chicken was delicious BUT the gnochi were burnt and the potatoes that came with the dish were undercooked and rock hard. I mentioned this to our waiter but unfortunately nothing was done about it and I was still charged for the meal. Definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"A truly \"Taste of Alberta\" restaurant.  This place is amazing with its fresh, local flavours and unique and wonderful combinations.  This is truly THE place to take visitors or simply come back to experience local tastes with a twist.  My mouth waters just thinking of this restaurant and the ambiance of the surroundings  is the cherry on top.  Adorable and comfortable decor and where else in Calgary can you dine in such a gorgeous park setting??? Nature envelopes you here as you nosh on the bounties of what it offers.  Don't miss this place!!   $$$$  is the only downside."}
{"text":"As for me?the price is a little high. However,  when I eat dinner was around by river, trees, sunshine and birds,etc. I believe that is fantastic, and I love it suddenly. Seasonal menu is a great method to attract customers. It is worth eating."}
{"text":"RC definitely isn't a Michelin-star restaurant but I do have to applaud them for using quality ingredients (YEAY!! for supporting local farmers) and for succeeding in creating an exceptional ambiance to dine in.     I personally like their baked goods. Maybe its the wood-fired oven ... So for those of you who are interested in what I thought of their dishes here's a summary of them. Don't know how useful they will be because RC does tend to change their menu occasionally.  -I love their flatbread & red lentil hummus dish. My favorite flatbread in town for sure.  -The quiche was good. The crust was perfectly cooked. love their herbed potato hash.  -Fish & Game platter is fun to try but I've had better. Great as an appetizer to share with someone.  -Arctic Char was good. Fish was fresh and well cooked.  -Noble Farm duck breast was yummy - flavors were perfectly balanced - Beef tenderloin was good too - I'm not a big fan of beef brisket though... so it was just okay for me. -Wild boar was on the menu last year but don't think it is anymore.  I really enjoyed it.  - Baked french toast is my favorite brunch item on the menu. creative and tasty dish. - farm eggs are also one of my favorite. yes, its just eggs but their scrambled eggs are cooked to perfection every time.  - not a big fan of the freshly baked goods - except for the fact that their croissant uses the house made butter , the danish and the muffins were fresh but boring.   - House made truffles are a must. I love them. Its not too filling and a perfect way to finish your meal.  - Creme brulee (which I prefer) and the ice creams are good too.   - Black current crush and their Wildberry iced tea is my favorite drinks for brunch. Coffee & tea is okay.     RC brings character to the dining community of Calgary and will be seeing more of me in the future!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times and every time I hope that it would blow me away,  but alas, not the case.  I went there for dinner the day before Valentine's Day.   We were seated by the window, which was kind of cold so I kept my jacket with me.  It took us a solid 5 mins to go through the wine binder and consult with the waiter before deciding on a gamay.  When it showed up, we were told the wine is a bit cold.  I had to warm it up in my hands.  Ordered the food, appetizers were promising, carrot soup and mussels, good stuff.  But sometimes its the little things that add up, like cold hard butter with bread.  They brought around candles for all the tables, so we warmed up the butter on a knife over the the open flame.  Main course, I ordered the roasted lamb medium, the meat was lukewarm, it had that dry look on top, like it had sat for some time and it was chewy.  Normally I would send it back, but I guess this being the 3rd time there, it just wasn't worth the hassle.  Ditto on the temperature for the beef striploin.  Dessert was ok, maple creme brule and apple pie with vanilla yogurt, cappucino and tea, nothing really crazy here, ok.  The thing that did it was overhearing a waiter tell another table that the special was shortribs at the end of our meal, I love short ribs and would have ordered it, if I had known there was a special.  I really have tried to like this place,  but there are just so many other restaurants I'd rather eat at, especially at this price."}
{"text":"Professional service every time, consistantly great food & great atmosphere. Love it. Eat here, you will have great memories of your brunch/lunch/dinner"}
{"text":"My husband told the restaurant well in advance when making a reservation that it was for our anniversary. They mentioned at the time they would make it special. When we arrived we were taken to all the way to the back of the restaurant, to a side table next to the washroom. We asked to be reseated as there were plenty of other seats in better locations in the main dining area that were still intimate. Witnessed a couple instances of racism when it came to seating guests. Food was mediocre. Waiter was not interested in his job, didn't even introduce himself. Nothing was done to make it a special night. I do not recommend this restaurant. Other suggestions for wonderful service and food include charbar, notable, Suzette's, and Bridgette bar."}
{"text":"Despite horrendous flood damage, River Cafe is back and is good as it ever was. Before the summer passes, get down there and dine on their patio.  Beautiful seafood creations like oysters on the half shell, calamari appetizers and halibut tempt the palate and glasses of Rose Cava keep it clean. Service is good and the staff are just getting back into the swing of things.   A worthy splurge.  Go back and support this fine Calgary business"}
{"text":"Ok, so I went to River Café in November... sorry i've got a lot of catching up to do.     The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because they force you to pay for water. If thats the case they should donate the funds from the water to a chairty organization, kind-of like Cibo does.  Anyway.... we took my mom there for a sunday brunch birthday celebration. Our waiter Chad was phenomenal. He was very attentive and wasn't overbearing or pushy. He was patient with my mom and her millions of questions and when we ordered was kind enough to make sure we knew exactly what we were in for.  My mom and I both had the Quiche. This was a traditional quiche which isn't supposed to be served hot like most other places do. It was creamy and had the right amount of flavour components, nothing overbearing. The side salad was fennel with gigantic slices of tomatoes. Im not the biggest fan of fennel but i happily ate the tomatoes.   My father had the  Hog wild peameal bacon and 64° egg. (for those of you that don't know-- a 64° egg is an egg slow cooked in the shell in a water bath (sous-vide most of the time) of 64 degrees Celsius and has a custard-like white and somewhat solid yolk). He loved it. No complaints or anything. He was really taken by the plate though, which was long and narrow, like it was meant to serve a fish on, and it was clear, Im pretty sure he spent more time talking about the plate then any part of his meal.  Boyfriend had the Elk Bacon eggs benny with brown butter hollandaise. It must have been awesome because he barely spoke the entire time we were there.   My mom later saw a student she once taught and went over to talk to them, I took this opportunity to go talk to chad about a surprise birthday dessert. He said i would have to pay for it which was no surprise and listed off the different desserts they had. I decided to go with the Maple crème brûlée withPecan Sugar Cookie and Candied Orange. Heaven! It was gone in less then 7 minutes.   I'd love to go back to River Café during the summer when the park is green and pretty and the weather is warm."}
{"text":"I've had dinner at the River Cafe twice.  Both times I've left thinking the place was just ok, but at the same time I'd recommend the place, mainly because of its setting.  The atmosphere is excellent.  The restaurant is set in Prince's Island Park, a picturesque park right off the downtown core.  We parked our vehicle in Kensington, a small community on the other side of the river and had a great walk along the river on our way to dinner.  The decor is rustic and hip, with shelves made out of canoes, snowshoes on the wall (I think), and tall ceilings with big wooden beams all through the restaurant.  It's very \"Canadian-chic,\" if that's even a term.  The menu - I'm not a big wine person, but from what I could tell the wine list was quite long.  Lots to choose from.  The food menu was a bit limited for me because I'm not a big seafood eater, but what we ordered was delicious (yummy steaks).  The service is where I found a couple of flaws.  My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and had made a reservation for the patio.  We had to wait about twenty minutes, which wasn't a huge deal, but it did make an impression on me.  As well, at the end of our meal we felt like the server forgot we were there.  Our plates sat in front of us for over a half an hour.  We decided to skip dessert because of the bad service and ended up going to another restaurant to finish celebrating.    I feel like they have some great servers on their staff, but they've also got some amateurs who, while they look the part, seem to have forgotten or never learned how to provide excellent service.  Just my two cents."}
{"text":"Went for an anniversary dinner and it was perfect. We got the chef's tasting which was 6 courses of local and fresh ingredients. While some would consider it costly it is a great experience and by the end of the meal the portion sizes proved to be perfect if not slightly too much.   The service was good, knowledgeable, and helpful. I would highly recommend this for couples or groups looking for a great food experience without being overly hipster."}
{"text":"Best bison I have ever had. Trust the chef and don't rewrite the menu to make your order. That's obnoxious for a place like this. Cook at home if you are that picky and weird."}
{"text":"Super.  Lots of local and sustainable meat options wonderfully prepared and oh so good.  Savoured every bite of my wild boar loin.  Still thinking about it a few days later.  Yum.  The setting is wonderful - in the middle of a park and right on the river - and service is great.  It's pricey (mains are $40+) but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I am writing this review for you out of towners, becaue I spend a lot of time away from home. Us Calgarians already know this place is good. The Chef,  Mr. Andrew Winfield is a serious professional and he knows what he is doing, and his staff know that they are doing. In my opinion this is the best resturant in the world. The food and the drinks are amazing."}
{"text":"I haven't been to River Cafe in years, so when a couple out of town guests suggested we go here for brunch I didn't object.  Lucky for us, the weather was nice so it literally was a \"walk in the park\" to get to the restaurant lol  It was quite busy but they had no troubles accommodating our large reso. Coffee and teas were poured, specials were read to us and orders were promptly taken. I love a good eggs benny and I wanted to try their bison bacon so that's what I settled on for brunch.  Everyone's food looked amazing, and I had a bite of my friend's brioche french toast which had the perfect amount of sweetness to it (white chocolate creme fraiche!)   Bison bacon is not as fatty as regular bacon, but it's definitely up there for savory flavor! And they didn't go with the usual english muffin, a fluffy biscuit soaked up the eggy and saucy goodness and brought the dish to a whole other level!  A brunch place that takes resos and serves quality food? Hard to come by in Calgary, but if you find it (River Cafe people!), take advantage of it!"}
{"text":"It's in beautiful part of this city. Really has the Calgary spirit. Great place for light brunch and just some overall great time"}
{"text":"We drove to Calgary over Labour Day weekend for a friends wedding and ended up here after a long day of driving. We ended up here mostly because it was close to the hotel and the only place that was open that wasn't fast food.  Like a lot of things in Calgary I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.  It fantastic to see a place that showcases Canadian ingredients in almost every dish. I don't remember exactly what I had, but I remember it being very good. I ended stealing a couple bites of my better half's plate and remarking that she may have won dinner.   Staff there is super friendly too. Very patient and willing to walk you though the menu, answer questions and make suggestions on drink pairings. Next time we're in Calgary, we'll be dining here."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for awhile (almost 5 years? LOL). I met up with someone here to talk about a business plan for brunch. We shared the fish and game platter-very unique and tasty. The rest of the menu and the plates I saw walk by over the course of the morning looked wonderful and require me to come back to try more menu items. The servers are highly professional which really does enhance the dining experience. The patio is beautiful and inside is rustic, cozy and charming.  The River Cafe has a simple elegance that makes it a great sport to lunch with friends, have a romantic meal or celebrate with family (oh and business brunches too). It isn't the cheapest but it is worth the little extra you pay. I think this will become a favourite spot for me and its a great place to bring visitors as well."}
{"text":"I shouldn't leave dinner still hungry but that's the feeling I walked out with. The food quality is high but don't expect large portions. My carrot \"3 ways\" appeared to be on a diet."}
{"text":"Tonight we had a great dinner at River Cafe.  I had the Tuna Takati & my wife had the Roasted Chicken.  The tuna was superbly prepared. But the chicken was by far the best grilled chicken we have had. Our server described how the chicken is brined, grilled and then roasted. These efforts payoff in a great tasting bird that is very juicy.  In addition to great food, the service was excellent. If we didn't live 3,000 miles to the SE, we would be weekly patrons."}
{"text":"I've never made it for dinner but the two times I've had lunch here all 3 courses have been outstanding.  Fresh ingredients, wild game, and interesting choices combines with a nice atmosphere and location make for one of the best experiences in Calgary.  The price isn't extravagant either, well worth what you get."}
{"text":"I have been here four times and it is consistently good. That's the mark of a great restaurant - consistency! I have tried several different appetizers and entrees - mostly fish - and have really enjoyed every morsel.   The atmosphere is charming and comfortable and the service is pleasant and attentive.   I particularly enjoy their own water. For $1 you can have unlimited still or sparkling water - their own - to help save on environmental issues from plastic or glass bottles.   Wish some other Calgary institutions would take a lesson from River Cafe."}
{"text":"This was a very romantic restaurant.  We completed our day of walking on the downtown Calgary trial with dinner at the restaurant.  It was pricey but the ambience and food were worth it."}
{"text":"I visited River Café for Big Taste this year. My cousin and I opted for the five course gourmet menu with the wine pairings so we could get the full experience. River Café did not disappoint! I loved every course. The champagne poached oyster was a real treat, my only wish is that you got more than one. I really loved the squid, and the chicken paté was delish. The price tag is as big as the taste, and 59274927 times larger than the portions. A worthy restaurant for a special occasion, if you want your fine dining to have a bit of a rustic edge -- this is totally a luxury winter cabin dining experience. I like it."}
{"text":"Fancy place with perfect atmosphere for special occasion. Menu change for a period, but the food is at average rate"}
{"text":"Yup, this is what I am talking about; cooked by real people with real ingredients; almost ordered an eggs benedict except that I had just had a mediocre breakfast up the street.  Went with a bison burger, ate some cheese, drank some wine-- had a wonderful time.  Great food cooked by people who think of themselves as real foodies.  A genuine joy.  I have heard that the duck breast is to die for, but that is second hand, though I trust the source.  Ummmmm.......  Currently, my favorite restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, nice decor and very cozy. The only thing is I didn't find my meal worth the price, Ill pay a pretty penny for delicious food but my flatbread was just ok, I wasn't blown away by the wild game platter either.  For dessert I did try one of their in house made truffles which were rich and wonderful paired with a nice cappuccino.  Service was great but the menu never seems to change so it starts to get boring after a few visits."}
{"text":"I was in for business from out of town, so I've only dined at River Cafe once.  I had just gotten out of a slightly stressful meeting and had a long drive, so I was tired and hungry.  After a very nice walk through the park, I was about to turn around and settle for some unremarkable food, when I happened upon River Cafe.  I didn't know anything about it, so I took a look at the menu.  It is very expensive, but I decided to treat myself after a rather rough day.  :)    I sat at the bar since I was dining alone.  I ordered the cauliflower soup, which was terrific and flavorful on a chilly day.  I loved the olive salt and crunchy croutons, which were such a nice contrast to the very smooth and delicate soup.  For my entree, I ordered the black cod.  Oh my, it was cooked to absolute perfection.   Black cod is probably my favorite fish ever.  It was accompanied by different colors of roasted cauliflower, which were delicious.  My only complaint was that the roasted potatoes were too salty, but that's ok--the fish and cauliflower were more than enough to eat.  The bread that they serve is absolutely fantastic and made in-house.  Yum.  I tried a sparkling wine from BC (Blue Mountain), which isn't exported to the US.  It was delightful.  Not like true champagne, of course, but very good in its own right.  I only regret that I was too stuffed to order dessert.  I guess I'm not a huge eater, but some folks have complained about small portions here.  I definitely did not find that at all.  I've certainly visited other fine dining places with miniscule portions, even for a smaller eater like me.  There was a good amount of food here!  Just wish the US dollar were stronger so that it wouldn't have been quite so pricey.  But still, I loved it.  The atmosphere is cozy and relaxed, which I absolutely loved.  The setting in the park is wonderful, of course.  The service was very professional and friendly.  As an aside, it just so happened that the two businessmen who were sitting next to me were from Illinois--one even lives in the town where I work!  Tiny world."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of the River Cafe, and was excited to try it.  Service was good, not obnoxious, just the right amount of checking in on us.  My husband and I shared the hummus and pita to start - very tasty.  I had the lobster and scallop dish, and my husband had the beef.  The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best, especially for the price.  We enjoy a nice meal, and don't mind paying for it, unfortunately, we just weren't super impressed.    Glad we got to try it, but won't be back - perhaps for brunch, but definitely not for dinner."}
{"text":"Took some USA guests to River Cafe on their last day, because I felt it was one of the more unique restaurants that showcase CALGARY! A cafe on an island, surrounded by the river--how cool! We sat outside on the patio for brunch. The food is on the pricier side, and the portion sizes are a bit smaller, but the smaller portion sizes stimulate your food craving! You just want more! Everything on the plate is very edible; often fancy restaurants may have garnishes and decoration that aren't very edible or enjoyable, but everything on the plate at River Cafe is always enticing. I also ate here for my friend's wedding, and even their decorative flowers are edible and delicious and nutritious!   For the brunch day, I ordered the Driview Farms Lamb Meatballs dish. It came with grains, tomatoes, and some other salady veggies. The meatballs were flavourful without being overtly gamey.   The only limitation I noticed that day was that the service was inconsistent. Our server gave us sparking water without asking our preference, and 3/4 of the table ended up switching to distilled. Also, the service often had long delays in service, and just the server's nonverbals showed some kind of frustration and unease. On the other hand, the server across our table appear fantastic; he was enthusiastic to guests and kneeling down to their level when speaking to them. I just wished that our guest service at our table matched the calibre of the food we ate!"}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Nice patio and decent food but not particularly memorable.  The location is certainly great to enjoy a lovely day.  The patio is mostly enshrouded by trees and bushes though, which is a bit of a pity considering its river-side location, if only I could've seen more of the river!  The menu for lunch is small and tries to be seasonal, with a good selection of sandwiches, a few daily specials and some regular entrees.  I tried their wood-grilled salmon.  Portion size was perfect, not overly filling.  The salmon was grilled to perfection, attaining a nicely crisp crust, the shards of pickled fennel and crisp haricot vert went well with the fatty fish and the creamy maitake mushrooms were a tasty and meaty side.  The potato cake was rather redundant.  Overall, I would say this place has good service, passable food and a nice patio."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday, Nov 28 2013. First of all, it was dark, snowy and cold, walking to the island. There were no signs that we could find (as newbies to Calgary we didn't really know where we were going) so we had to ask someone else who was walking and followed them, and the footbridge across the water was pitch black. If I was on my own I may not have crossed - seriously unsafe.  The restaurant is very cute - nice ambiance - I'd love to go there in the summer and sit outside on the patio for a light lunch.   As for my birthday dinner, I got the 'special' which was some kind of game meat, I think elk.  My review here is not specific, as it's been a while... but rather, it is to review the general feeling we had. It was very expensive, at $45-50 for each of our entrees, and we picked the cheapest bottle of wine which was still around $40. We're used to paying decent money for good food, but we were both a little disappointed in our meals... they were good, but not amazing, and the servings were small. Tiny little potatoes and a tiny amount of veggies. We had to eat two baskets of bread to get full. They brought me a nice dessert on the house with a sparkler in it for my birthday.  We did have a nice experience, but we won't go back for a fancy dinner as it was too much money for what it was (especially with the wine). We will however go back for a summer lunch and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"A great place to go for a special evening.  The River Cafe is a restaurant to go if you want to enjoy food. Expect to spend some more money but you will get delicious cuisine. Try the Rosemary Lemonade...  Affordable parking I available at Memorial Drive. Just cross the pedestrian bridge which is right at the parking lot - it is a 5 minute walk only."}
{"text":"just stopped in today for a late lunch on a gorgeous sunny day. i was dining alone, and there was just enough space on the deck to accomodate me.  the ambiance is beautiful. rustic, but not log-cabin-ny. my server definately knew the menu inside and out, including the wine menu.   i ended up going with the duck rilette sandwich served with the lightest homeade purple chips. oh man. everything is better with duck fat. this sandwich was eloquantly done with arugula, brie, a little bit of honey, and some in-house baked artisan bread. dang. i think they even brushed the inside of the bread with the duck fat, and let that puppy lightly toast on the wood grill.  would definately stop in again."}
{"text":"One of our favourite spots in Calgary. The food is truly local and imaginative, service is impeccable, and the location is one of a kind. We've been impressed every time and always look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Good for brunch. They use fresh ingredients and that definitely shows in the flavour of their food. The location is great for warm summer days and the service is outstanding"}
{"text":"Our hotel recommended this place. We wanted somewhere nice with atmosphere to celebrate my birthday.  We made reservations.  This restaraunt has great open windows and an outdoor seating area overlooking the river. However, reservations are worthless and they will seat you in the worst seats of the place. Making reservations is pointless and so Im giving 2 stars since it was a main reason I chose this place. I had no intention of sitting and making my child wait at a restaraunt, so we made reservations. Waits are one thing. Waits with reservations shouldn't be more then 10 minutes in my world. We haven't tried the food yet, but may have to give up sooner than later on the restaraunt. I'll update to a 3 star if the food makes up for the 2 stars.  When we finally sat down they are out of items on the menu. They don't have small child size options except cheese pizza.  Why would I go to a nice restaurant for pizza? Let me add that this isn't a pizza restaraunt. They have a shrimp appetizer but it's served only partially cooked. And I waitress was rude, unaccomadating with bad attidue. A restarauny of this scale should be able to provide a dish where they cook the shrimp done by request. And an attitude at any price is never necessary ."}
{"text":"Great setting, in the park.  Although we sat inside (at the extreme urging of the hostess) it is so open air that you get breezes if fresh air.  Food is good but not spectacular.  I had trout and loved it.  Other dishes in our party were sablefish, steak, pork... All 'ok'.   The panna cotta was excellent.   Rice pudding too rustic.    The location is a detriment if you're slow, my dad has a cane.  But I called and the allowed me to drive up for drop off.  This location is a real plus otherwise send we enjoyed strolling after."}
{"text":"Best place to go in Calgary for a special occasion. Cozy in the winter and lovely and bright in the summer. I would also take visiting friends and family here if they were looking for local fare."}
{"text":"We were celebrating a birthday and the server wasn't aware nor attentive to our table as she was serving us (6pax) plus another large table (10pax). She forgot my beverage, rang the wrong dish on an order, and was nowhere to be found when we needed service (had to actually wave down other servers more than once to get service).  We were shocked that the pastries we thought were complimentary (she offered them because our food would take longer due to the 10pax) were charged to my guests bills!! Food was delicious but that was the extent of the experience.  A frustrated guest of mine who arrived later with her boyfriend was sat at a smaller table. They wanted to get up and leave as the level of service by both the server and the manager felt unacceptable. Neither of them provided table service (although my guests were ready to order) for approx 10-15 mins until I waved her down (which is now the 5th time). The room isn't large and now there were only 3 other tables (2pax) in a different servers section. The poor service was a disappointment as we recently dined at the Deane House and knew they were sister restaurants (where service was superb!!) a couple of weeks before. Again, the food was fantastic, but the service was lacking. I was embarrassed for bringing my guests there."}
{"text":"Great spot in the park! Love the ambience, food, drinks, service ...everything. The host took care of us very well. Food arrived on a timely manner. Love the outdoor area.  Keep up good work!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner with another couple and sat outside. The setting is outstanding on the island and the patio is great on a warm evening. The service was prompt and professional.  We had the hummus as a starter and it was excellent. The ladies had the trout which was fair. I had the duck which was a little dry and an incredibly small portion. Although I enjoy the setting it's very expensive for what's served. I'll likely call in for a drink or lunch in the future but think there's far better value in Calgary. The bill was $430 for the four of us with one shared starter, mains and two bottles of wine."}
{"text":"The cellar has a great selection and the way the beef is prepared; so tender it can be cut with a fork. The service was just okay, did not feel it enhanced the fine dining experience. This was definately, the my highest bill to date for fine dining, which is okay as the food and ambience and time spent, met our expectation. Try to book a window seat so as to gaze out on Princess Island. (Do So in Winter/Sping and Fall.) I have been told that people say window seats are cold, we were warm.  During the summer season, your experience is more memorable if seated on the patio. Post meal, go for a skate on the canal or take a stroll through the park."}
{"text":"Great food, beautiful location and if the weather is nice, sitting on the patio is a must! This is a good pick if you want a romantic setting. It's a little pricier but it's fitting for a special meal."}
{"text":"Had an excellent early bird dinner on a relaxing Sunday night at this Calgary institution. Service was excellent even though I was a small check. Their complementary house made sourdough bread is exceptional. The hummus and flatbread was solid and had a unique twist unique lentils in place of chickpeas. The trout with peas, potatoes and buttermilk was delicious. All in all a highly recommended place in Calgary for anyone who loves great terroir driven cuisine"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been at least 10 times in the past few years. I love the walk out to the restaurant on Prince's Island Park (well, when it colder than -20, not so much). Love the Canadian island atmosphere. Love the view of the city. But I especially love the food - tasty interpretation of traditional foods done really well. River Cafe is pricey but for me the food and the atmosphere definitely make it worth it. Also, they make a great picnic for the nearby Shakespeare in the Park."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation at the River Cafe for Valentine's Day with the wife due to a recommendation from a friend. As we drove towards the restaurant I soon realized by looking on my maps that we would have to walk the last stretch of the trip to get to the restaurant. The walk turned out to be a pleasant surprise (Princess Island Park was all lit up and romantic-like). We showed up 30 minutes early for our reservation, the hostess assured us it wouldn't be a problem and quickly seated us by the window next to the fireplace (yet another pleasant surprise!). We ordered the fish and game plate to start off the meal which was very interesting. I quite like the variety of not so common meats, my wife was not as big of a fan however. My wife ordered the cut of naturally raised beef which she absolutely loved and I tried the lamb dish I forget the exact name but it also was delicious. After dinner we then ordered desert (espresso creme brûlée withe almond biscotti and some sort of chocolate tart with ice cream,topping the meal off perfectly) and shared a bench style seat right in front of the fireplace.  Overall a wonderful date night experience if you're willing to spend a few dollars (our meals with a bottle of wine and tip was 260 but could be done for 150). Will be returning and recommending to friends for sure"}
{"text":"was here for their annual \"big taste\" (foodie, pre fixe menu event) and loved every dish served. a lot of detail and a lot of very good food pairings. great selection of ingredients used and a lot of care put into every dish. loved the chicken pate with grapefruit. Also been here for their normal brunch menu and was very satisfied with their eggs benedict. a great spot on a small island downtown Calgary on the Bow River."}
{"text":"The River Cafe was recommended to us by a friend who used to live in Calgary, and we're thrilled we took the opportunity to check this place out.   The location itself is wonderful; being on the island in nice weather in early fall allowed us to sit on the patio for the evening, and take in the view as the sun began to set.   The River Cafe has just changed over the menu for fall, so things were new to both the servers and the customers, but what showed up on the plate was fantastic. I had the Pacific Cod with butternut gnocchi, and my BF had the wild boar chop with walnuts and blueberry. Both were amazing, and very satisfying.   The dessert menu has a number of tempting options, so I'd suggest you indulge. Don't miss the opportunity!"}
{"text":"Canadian Local Fare that emphasizes seasonal ingredients. It is now reopened! It has been open for a week now since the flooding and we went to show our support,  even if only for drinks. I am glad we only had drinks as I fear had we ordered any food, we would still be sitting there many hours later. *Service was terrible*. Unfriendly, super slow and it was not at all busy, even on the patio.  15 minutes to order a drink , half hour to get our drinks...zzzzzzzzzzzz.  Let's face it, you are paying for the amazing location, in the park, along the water. Such a nice spot. A martini is $11, a glass of wine is $10, beer is $6.75 and be aware, they lost their kegs for now so you can only have bottled beer at the moment (for all the draft beer drinkers). An average meal is $38-$48 for an entree. We may come back for a special occasion as the restaurant itself was adorable. Very cozy, rustic and clean. Would make for a great date-spot."}
{"text":"Allow me to paint you a picture... It is a crisp Saturday morning, not a lot of people are out, there is snow in Prince's Island Park, the sun is shining and I am enjoying the company of a new friend going for a walk.  Everything is lovely, despite the cold, so we decide to head to the River Cafe - now, I have never been here for brunch, so I am entirely unsure of what to expect, my new found friend has never been here, ever.  Let me fill in another part of the picture... a picturesque cafe, nestled in a lovely park, looks like a cabin, and is extremely homey... Until you tell them you are just enjoying coffee and pastries.  I know, I know, the River Cafe, coffee and pastries? Must be insane right? That was what our server thought, apparently. Service was fantastic at the start, we ordered coffee and their pastry basket... Out comes the lovely Kicking Horse organic coffee, out come the delightful pastries (I could have eaten ten of the fantastic apple cinnamon danishes); we talk, we laugh, we enjoy the coffee, the pastries and the atmosphere. As we finish up the pastries, our waitress looks positively puzzled as we say \"No, just some more coffee, thank you\"... She tops up our coffee and our bottomless water without leaving the second bottle (funny how that works), and proceeds to leave us to our conversation... For TWENTY minutes... Empty water glasses, empty coffee cups... We were ready to go anyway, but to wait 20 minutes, and to have the waitress presumptuously bring us the bill?  Apparently I was wrong about this place... They weren't at all busy, and I have never been pushed out the door when I have a big bill... Such disappointing service at the end. Oh, and I particularly loved the host NOT getting our jackets from the coat check for us. That was the icing on the cake.  All in all - good food, good service until they realize you are not dropping $100. I will NOT be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I used to love River Cafe, gorgeous location on the river and close to where I worked.   But the past two times I have gone, it has been sub-par. The last time we did brunch for the hubs birthday with my parents. The place wasn't busy, yet we barely saw our server. When we did see him, he repeatedly knocked over this metal bucket they had placed to collect water that was leaking from the roof. There was nothing gluten free, which surprised me, as they pride themselves on natural, local etc etc. And for the portion size, the prices were quite high.   Needless to say, it will be a long time for before I return."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful, quaint little restaurant is such a picturesque location. We found this place whilst staying at the Sheraton and I'm so glad we did. We decided to go for the weekend brunch as the menu sounded good. It was really busy on a Saturday late morning, we were lucky to get a table. They had an open fire which made it feel really cosy, it's very open so you can sit back and look out at the park. The food was delicious, slightly fine dining but the portions were a good size. Service was good, they offer you the choice of still or sparkling water which I thought was a nice touch. Overall it was a great experience and would definitely return if I was staying in the area."}
{"text":"River Café is my go-to place when I want to take someone to a nice meal. Whether it's family and friends or a business meeting it always gets a great response due to it's friendly atmosphere, great food, and awesome location. The food is fantastic. I don't think I've ever had something that I thought was less than mind-blowingly amazing. Would give 6 stars."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great- it smells wonderful in there too- I think they have a wood burning stove. The service is top notch. Our waiter was knowledgeable, attentive, and never in the way.   The food is pretty good. Not great though. My cauliflower soup was bland. And the flavors in my fish didn't complement each other as well as they should have. The hummus was ok- nothing to write home about. Almost everything could have used some lemon juice, some pepper or some vinegar. The dessert we ordered was fantastic though- a peach cobbler with ice cream.   For the price I was paying, I would say the food was not worth it. Each of us dropped $100 CAD on an entrée, an appetizer, some shared dessert and some wine. I've had cheaper and more delicious meals at comparable establishments in New York City. The huge windows overlooking the park and the river make it better though. In short- you seem to be paying more for the experience of eating in the park than for quality food."}
{"text":"You take one of the most gorgeous pieces of land in Calgary and then pair it with top notch local food, fine service, a lush patio and a strong dash of that classic Canadian cottage look and then you somehow can the kitsch and keep it tasteful,  - You've got yourself the River Café.  While the interior is really quite comfortable, warm with plenty of wood, log framed chairs and half-canoe shelves giving it and unmistakably Canadian feel, what really shines at the River Café is the patio. If you catch Calgary on that rare occasion where the ground isn't frozen, the wind isn't blowing, or the whole island isn't underwater (not to make light, I'm beyond impressed at your resilience, River Café, and I'm beyond happy to have you a part of Calgary again.) make sure you get a spot out side. Look around you! You're on an incredible island park in the middle of a skyscraper clad city and then you get to immerse yourself in the wild garden feel of a stone patio with log railings, plenty of plants and blankets ready for you if you get a chill.  Enjoy this inner-city wilderness retreat. Breathe. Sip some wine and savour the really top notch food.  I find the prices fair and the food worthy of any restaurant. While yes, the scenery is gorgeous, I believe River Café stands on its own. While yes, she's gorgeous, she's got the smarts and the personality to back it all up. River Café is one fine patio pick for corporate lunches, tourist expeditions and also for locals to meet up with good friends over a tasty meal.   I can't wait to show another person what they've got to offer. Check them out."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Sitting on the deck, cooling off with a nice ale, then digging into the pear flatbread was heaven. The trout entree was another winner, though just about everything on the menu had me salivating. I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"We love this place so much. Its the most amazing place in the summer for date night. Super romantic!"}
{"text":"The River Cafe is an attractive restaurant among a pretty Prince's Island. Walking here within Downtown Calgary is almost half the fun.   I dined here recently as part of a Business trip. This is a \"Local and Sustainable\" food place and it executes this well with very good food attractively presented. The wine list was interesting (albeit with a relatively limited selection of Canadian choices) and the service was friendly and attentive.   The River Cafe is not cheap, although it's sometimes hard to separate the factors of overall Calgary prices, the trendy factor, and a Loonie that is now worth more than the US Dollar. I would gladly come back as this is place I'd love to take Gayle and spend some quality date night time."}
{"text":"After a long hiatus because of the flooding at Prince's Island, my husband and I came here to attend a friend's wedding and dinner reception this past weekend.   We (and all the other guests) were greeted warmly by four servers at the door who were offering glasses of homemade lemonade and wine.        After the wedding ceremony on the patio, there was a raw oyster bar set up on the patio (which was not really my thing) and a huge fish and game board (bison prosciutto, pate, buffalo mozzarella, smoked trout, flatbreads).  The servers were also offering the guests wild boar meatball and gougere sliders (the boar was sooo juicy!), sausage with peach skewers (great combination), and halibut croquettes (flavorful with just the right amount of crunch).     Heirloom roasted tomato soup:  sweet and just the right temperature when it arrived at our table of ten. My salad was lightly seasoned and very tasty.  The crunch from the homemade cracker was a good contrast to the leafy greens. The seared Haida halibut with beets, corn, shaved fennel and chanterelles in a white bean puree was cooked to perfection.  The halibut was melting in your mouth and the vegetables and mushrooms complemented the fish perfectly. The panna cotta was amazingly light and the sliced plums, chocolate bark and oatmeal (unusual garnish, but it worked) on top was a perfect match.    We were extremely impressed with how the kitchen staff and the servers performed before, during, and after service (there were around 75 guests). The kitchen even went out of their way to create a vegetarian appetizer and main course for a guest who was sitting at our table. Our servers were attentive enough to describe each course as it came to our table and also took the time to check on how we liked our main courses.  Our wine and water glasses were constantly being filled and we were also promptly given coffee and/or tea after dessert.  River Cafe, you are better than ever before!"}
{"text":"I was able to visit this place on my Calgary, Canada trip with my family. This place is located in Prince's Island Park, which is a tourist site in Calgary . It's a bit of a walk to get to this restaurant, but well worth it.  I've never felt so warm and welcome in a place on vacation . As soon as we walked in , everyone was very nice . We did not have to wait long before we were seated .  FIrst of all, everything inside looks so natural, very rustic. A lot of wood furniture , but in a posh way .  Not to mention, you are near the beautiful water and flowers. So serene. I could definitely see this as a romantic outing with a loved one.   I ordered the Lobster Eggs Benedict . I seem to order Eggs Benedict everywhere I go.  It was very yummy and was served with biscuits instead of the usual english muffins .  I love when a different take is done on a dish.  The service was impeccable . They also had a pretty good wine list if you're in the mood for it .  If you haven't visited Calgary, when you do, be sure to make this a day of fun at Prince's Island and this fab establishment."}
{"text":"I love how this place looks in the middle of the park. Perfect for walking around before or after your meal.   I've only been for brunch and the food was pretty good. The little pastry basket was good for sharing. The eggs benedict was good, except that I asked for my egg to be soft and one came out completely hard. The server apologized though and service was amazing. Tiramisu was good but nothing amazing that I would go back for. The chocolate tart was good, and the fruit sorbet was so refreshing, I would recommend. The drinks were refreshing and nice on the patio, but nothing to write home about. Mixed feelings about the food depending on the dish, but I would definitely be willing to go back and try for dinner.  $2 parking underground at Eau Claire on the weekends if you are having trouble finding street parking for free :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a unique spot. I love how the restaurant is right in the middle of the park. So after you are finished enjoying the views you can literally have a picnic in the park. Such a smart idea.  It's interesting because I made a reservation on open table for Saturday brunch thinking it would be more busy. However, I was surprised to find that they had quite a few open tables.  Nonetheless, it was a great experience. They use all local products so you won't find anything not found in Canada on the menu.  Overall I enjoyed my food. I ordered the Pacific Ling Cod off of the weekend brunch menu. It was well seasoned and filling.  I also tried a bit of the bison burger. It was really savory and satisfying! The meat was soft and the bread was nice and flaky. If I ever go back I will get the bison burger instead."}
{"text":"Nice place. I have to agree with the popular consensus that it is a very romantic place. The location is just amazing. The view of the city is breath taking. The food is very good, but some of the dishes are a bit out of the norm. If you like some kind of 'wild game', then you will probably appreciate the menu more than most. The service was attentive and the host was hilarious. If you wanted to take someone out on a nice date, then River Cafe is the place to go, but don't expect it to be cheap."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a long time and came for a quick Valentine's Day lunch :) it was a romantic walk and the setting is adorable. Food was good but not mind blowing, service impeccable. Overall a wonderful date location :)"}
{"text":"Go for a stroll to get to this super romantic place for a special dinner with a love one.  Celebrated my husband's birthday here and it was the first time we tried this place.  It's very warm and rustic inside with the right amount of lighting.  What I liked was it wasn't too loud like many places so you can actually here the person in front of you.  The service was great.  It's seasonal cuisine so it's not an extensive menu.  We had appetizers to start, the bison tartare and the fish & game board.  Great combination of cured meat, sausage and fish.  The bison tartare was melt in your mouth and with the homemade sesame crackers, had great textures.  For dinner 3 of us had the wild hog boar striploin, delicious, cooked perfection.  My friend had the organic chicken and what can I say, it's chicken, nothing special other than the presentation."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had anywhere.  The cocktail menu was a little on the sweet side for my taste but the food was awesome.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"B-List overall. A - List For The Patio. Rating 3 to 4. Go for specific food choices, ambiance and service. The location is among the best in the city. The patio (with heat lamps) is superb from late spring to the golden views of fall. The chefs do a very good to outstanding job of their signature dishes. Some of the appetizers (game platter as an example) are surprisingly unimpressive. The drinks vary. The wine and specialty drinks tend to be very good. The beer I experienced was good and in smaller glasses. Better, colder beer can be found elsewhere. This would be a great place to take out-of-town guests, celebrate a special occasion or just to get away from the feeling of being in a major city. And what could be better than strolling Prince's Island Park as part of your lunch or dinner experience at the River Cafe. Expen$$$ive."}
{"text":"Went in there for dessert, horrible service, food quality was okay. I think server let restaurants reputation gone to it's head ......  There was no greeting, not even water were served to us. We asked him question and he never answer them, just said he will go check then we found him happily serving table of 6 besides us...  The next time we saw him was when he passed us the bill, not a thank you or how was the food....  Wow...."}
{"text":"The ambience here is perfect: Set in Prince's Island Park with a water view and surrounded by gardens.  I love getting a table on the patio.  It's so rustic and beautiful.  Great for date night!  The staff are friendly and welcoming.    The food is seasonable and local.  The red lentil hummus is very good; although the flatbread that accompanied the hummus plus the bread that came with the meal was in all a bit too carb-y for me.  But the salted butter was so good that I couldn't resist the bread!  I had the pickeral as my main and it was very good while hubby had the bison striploin and loved every bite of it.  We were too stuffed for dessert (bread overload!) but would love to come back to try it in the future."}
{"text":"I will give them five stars if they fix the wooden chairs at the tables so that they don't feel like torcher chambers. It's the only complaint that Colin and I had. The food had delicate and complimentary flavors that seemed near perfection to me. They use only local ingredients and in the summer grow their own herbs and other fresh items in the back behind the restaurant. The first time we went I had a duck procuitto that had a strong but not overpowering smoky flavor unlike any procuitto I've ever tasted. It came with a berry side that went perfectly. My favorite desert is creme brûlée and the best I ever had was at the river cafe. It was a camomile honey, creme brûlée. The menu was different every time we went which is good in some ways but bad in that you can't have your favorite again. This is a perfect date restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here more times than I would have liked. It is such a nice venue, but consistently the poorest service and over priced food.   It takes 20 mins to get a drink and it seems like there are waiters standing around everywhere and yet no one is attending to you.  I have never been there once without having to get up from my table and ask for a waiter.   The food, once you get it is OK but not worth the price they charge.  It's so sad.  We kept going back because we love the island, but not sure I can justify it anymore.  I assume they survive on tourists who don't know the difference and people who just don't mind sitting for hours.   If u do go, and have a few hours and a few hundred bucks and lots of patience, order the hummus and the bison burger."}
{"text":"It's beautiful, inner decoration and also the snow view outside in the park. Food was gorgeous. Service perfect."}
{"text":"Dinner at 830 Saturday evening 06 Aug 2011, and once again we were not disappointed. To start, we shared the fish and game board, which in this month's version included boar paté and bison prosciutto; for mains my son ordered the pork chop, my wife chose the sablefish, and I asked for the steelhead trout. For desserts we tried the apricot cake (wife), panna cotta (me), and fresh peaches on vanilla bean gelato (son). All good. Our server suggested a wine we'd never had before, a biodynamically-grown chenin blanc from the Loire -- 2009 sec Domaine Huet Vouvray Le Haut Lieu, which paired well with the sablefish and trout -- starting off-dry and trailing with a subtle acidity. River Cafe previously introduced us to wines that have become some of our favourites -- another reason we love the place so. Yes, it's on the spendy side, but we were (belatedly) celebrating our anniversary. Worth it."}
{"text":"Breakfast was so delicious and creative. I really admire the chef , his braveness and talent. I also liked the service and servers. I ll definitely will go there again whenever I go to Calgary. Don't miss the river view in river cafe."}
{"text":"What a lovely place for a classy lunch. I felt like I escaped the madness of downtown for a few hours and did not want to leave the River Cafe to go back to work. A super high end venue filled with rustic charm and a cozy atmosphere to match the wonderful menu and wine list. I've lived in calgary for 5 years and finally made it to this gem of a resto. I can't stop telling my friends about this place, you should go asap."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Calgary. Great service, great ambiance and great food w excellent plating! Every dish was an art piece. I had their Wild Ramp Mignonette Oysters, Gamay Noir Red Wine and High Country Bison Striploim. The oysters were fresh and juicy, the gamay was medium bodied w an earthy finish and the bison tasted like a leaner file mignon. On top of my meal, I was working on a dead line that evening. The waitress took notice and mentioned for me to stay as late as I needed and insisted that I get whatever I need to get done. I was floored. I tried not to stay too late and left close to 11pm and they were hospitable down to the last minute I was there. Genuine folks that really take care of you without any pretention."}
{"text":"Creative culinary options, great service, and a setting that transports.  This must be a special occasion spot for locals as I'd be shocked to see this price point draw in the masses.  The walk here in itself is a great opening to a wonderful evening of dining."}
{"text":"Overpriced in our opinion. 21 dollars for a burger with a greasy bun and soggy lettuce and a very dry crouton side dish......what was that? Four dollars for a side of syrup for the French toast and a dollar for water.  I don't mind paying for great food, but this was average at best.  Won't return for weekend lunch/brunch."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try River Café for a looooooong time. Located right in the middle of Prince's Island Park, it's the perfect spot to drop by after a nice, leisurely walk around the park. When I saw their menu on Big Taste, I was even more intrigued and knew I had to try them out.  I met up with my friend A, who booked us a reservation for 2pm, and the rest is history. There's lots of parking nearby but just make sure you give yourself a couple extra minutes as you'll have to park and walk to River Café. We might have been a bit late but we called to let them know and they were very accommodating. For a Sunday, the place was bustling with people. The décor has a very rustic, cabin feel to it but still maintains a modern, contemporary feel to it. Just gorgeous. Perfect spot to bring a date.  While the brunch/lunch menu sounded tempting, we couldn't resist the Big Taste three course lunch tasting menu, which was an absolute STEAL at $15.00! You could even get wine pairings for an additional $14.00 (pretty dang reasonable) but we opted out this time.  - Driview Farms lamb - Beck Farms carrot emulsion, coriander, Lyalta watercress, Three Farmers camelina oil and pumpkin seed. The fact that they gave us something unique as an appetizer over your typical soup/salad dish was a win in my book. The lamb was absolutely delicious! A nice mix of wild, earthy root vegetables and this crumbly texture (from the pumpkin seed?) was a delight. Plating and presentation was also absolutely breathtaking.  - Wood grilled albacore tuna and soft poached egg - Venturi Schulze verjus, brown butter roasted parsnips, smoked Poplar Bluff potato purée and preserved pear. The potato puree, think elegant mashed potatoes, was the best I've ever had so far in my life. The tuna was perfectly cooked with just enough sear to it. I'm not a big egg fan but this one was a delight - perfectly poached and soft to a tee.  - Highwood Crossing oatmeal and maple syrup cookies - so cute. Two cookies to end our meal that came in a to go brown bag. We couldn't wait and ate them right then and there. Nice crunch and not too sweet.  River Café is bomb. Everything was top notch, from the service to the food. There's a reason they were voted #67 on Canada's 100 Best Restaurants for 2016. Definitely a must for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Make a reservation. You will need to park across the river and walk onto the island. The atmosphere is straight out of a wintry wonderland. The food is excellent. We had the pear flat bread and it was amazing. My favorite is the squash gnocchi. The burgers are huge, juicy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Every time I have visited Calgary, I have always wondered about River Cafe. This long weekend we decided to give it a try. After our experience I wonder why I haven't tried it any sooner! Impeccable service and food. I DEFINITELY recommend!! Try out the Red Pepper Hummus. It's delicious. This is one of my new favourite spots in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Very expensive, but always a memorable meal and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous lunch on the patio at the River Café. What a great location, patio, staff - winner all the way around. The food is really nicely presented and the flavors are delicious.  I took the waiter's suggestion of the pot pie and it was so flavorful! A nice grainy mustard based stew filled with chicken, pork belly, potatoes and veggies all topped with a crispy fried crust.  Very filling. And the prices here are pretty good, including for bottled beer - they rival any brewhouse or chain restaurant for beer prices for sure and they have an awesome selection.  No Molson here! Thanks for a great afternoon RC!"}
{"text":"You cannot get a better location for fine dinning in Calgary. Right next to the turquoise Bow River on Prince's Island Park, you are nestled right in beautiful picturesque Calgary landscape - and Calgary is not the prettiest of cities to visit in Canada. So come here if you are a tourist if you're wanting to experience the best of Calgary!  I've dined here a couple times now. After perusing Instagram for the best brunch spots in Calgary, I decided to come here for their weekend brunch this time. I ordered their hog wild boar ham, which is a poached duck egg dish accompanied by asparagus, and a large portion of boar ham. A nice exotic twist on a traditional dish. The cuisine here is generally pretty creative.   Everything I have tried here is yummy. If you're a foodie definitely bookmark this place and visit for on a nice snowy or sunny day (sit on their patio). You'll feel super outdoorsy and fancy at the same time."}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person who would normally write a bad review online (this is my first negative review that I've ever written). However, I felt compelled to write one about River Café after my most recent experience at the restaurant. My fiance and I had made a tradition out of going to River Café for our anniversary. The first two years were excellent, this time not so much. We made a reservation but when we arrived we were told \"we don't have a table for you, you can grab a seat at the bar while you wait\". There was no apology and after waiting at the bar for 40 minutes, we were finally seated at our table (again with zero apology). We ordered the Chefs tasting menu with wine pairings and what ensued was truly a bizarre dining experience. When you order from the tasting menu, you don't necessarily know what you're going to receive and it's the responsibility of the server to ensure that each dish/wine is explained. We had several different people deliver the food to our table, one of whom was a busser that said \"this is the lamb but I don't know what else is with it\". During another instance, our server dropped off a glass of wine and said \"this is a Chardonnay\" with no other descriptor. I'm aware that it might sound snobby but you'd expect the service to be MUCH sharper than this at a restaurant with a reputation like the River Café. As per usual, the food was delicious but it was definitely odd not really knowing what were were eating for large portions of the meal.   A few days later I sent an email explaining that that our experience was disappointing and asking why the service had missed the mark that night when we'd always had a fabulous time there in the past. I never received a response... I think that's more disappointing than the poor dining experience itself. All of these might seem like small details but it definitely put a damper on our special evening because it felt like we weren't valued as customers. River Café used to be one of our favourite restaurants in Calgary but unfortunately we will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Went to dinner with friends and was happy to find this restaurant.  It is a nice walk to the restaurant and well worth the trek."}
{"text":"A classy establishment in the middle of the Prince Island park. go enjoy the patio during summer days, or dress up and go there for a date at night. You will enjoy, trust me!"}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service!  The bison burger was the best I've ever had.  The ambiance was spectacular.  Upscale gourmet with prices to match but well worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely FANTASTIC experience here!  After wanting to try River Cafe for ages, I finally had the opportunity last weekend to celebrate my sister in law's birthday. Little did I know, it was actually a food & wine pairing, which I had never done before. Needless to say I was excited, considering how much I love both of those things!  The restaurant itself is gorgeous, but that goes without saying. Situated in the middle of Prince's Island Park, you can either park near the Eau Claire shopping centre, or across Memorial in the lot. Our reservation was for 5pm, so the sun was still shining through the big, open windows and the breeze flowed through beautifully. The decor is simple, yet classy and feels upscale but not pretentious. The overall feeling is warm & cozy, as evidenced by the beautiful throw blankets set aside for guests who get chilly. Love it already!  Once we arrived we were tended to by a wonderful server. I missed his name but he was fabulous - and 10 steps ahead of all of us. When someone dropped a napkin, he was there to pick it up before you even realized it fell. When you ran out of water, he was topping it up before you had the chance to ask. He was extremely polite, friendly, and knowledgeable about everything we were being served. He informed us that we would be going through 9 courses, so thank goodness I was starving! We ordered cocktails to start, I had the River Ice and it was fabulous! Light & refreshing and exactly what I was looking for.  I know I won't remember any of the wines we were paired, all I know is that I had never given it much thought until this meal. The way the wine complimented every flavor in each dish was exquisite! We started with a soup - pureed vegetables with fresh cream and a piece of prosciutto on top. It was very tasty, albeit not as hot as I would prefer. Our next course was a lovely crab salad with asparagus & yellow and red tomatoes.  Ahhh perfection. Next we had eggplant with vine ripened tomatoes and cheese (the kind escapes me, it WAS a wine pairing after all). Once that was finished we had squid with a side of greens & toasted chickpeas. It was so delicious! When the lamb came out I was thrilled (ohgodsodamngood) it was paired with a small onion, asparagus, and crusted pork belly - mmmmm. Next was a bison tenderloin which was easily my favourite. At this point I was getting full and drunk! The desserts started coming, the first of which was a delicious ice cream sandwich with cookies, vanilla ice cream, and a delicious raspberry jam/drizzle! We finished that off with a small cheese board and finally, chocolate truffles. The presentation of each dish was well thought out and beautiful, and the wine pairings were truly beautiful and complimentary.  I won't lie I loved every single thing we had and I ate everything off each plate. It was decadent and everyone in the group really loved it - not just the food, but the entire experience. It was such a special evening and one I wont soon forget. The food along with the amazing service ensured I will DEFINITELY be back, and I can't wait - that beautiful patio is a must!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here. Its as if you are on a small island/ town and you are dining at a very warm Canadian restaurant. Kind of give you that family style feeling. Its nice and bright inside. So when you look out you have a nice few of lots of green and you might even see the Bow river. You must make a reservation to dine here. They do get quite busy.   So came and ordered the smoked halibut eggs benedict for $19. My sister ordered the same thing. She loved it. For me, I loved it too. But I did find the halibut a bit too salty. The potatoes were really good. Best part is their in house ketchup which look like tomatoe paste. Their ketchup was really good.   One thing here is that they charge for water. $1 per person for water and its really just normal water (nothing special).  Food is definitely on the pricier side. Overall, it was good. The poached egg was cooked perfectly (which is the hardest part).   Overall, I did like the food. If the halibut wasn't that salty it would be perfect for me.  Definitely a place that tourist should visit."}
{"text":"Don't wear sky-high heels, as it's a bit of a hike from wherever you parked.   The food here is \"fusion\" so it's a bit interesting. But good! It's probably not for people who just want hamburgers, which is usually me.  I ordered the \"Blini,\" which was a fluffy pancake with peaches on top. I liked it, but didn't end up SUPER stuffed afterwards.   It's a little pricier, so I don't recommend just \"popping in\" here. The dress code seemed to be dressy casual.  The staff here are EXCELLENT. This is how service should be performed. Our server was genuinely nice and knew everything about the menu and had great recommendations.     My friend went to the washroom and a server unrelated to our table stopped and folded her napkin on her chair and continued on his way. Great great service makes all the difference!"}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous. Rustic, homey and quintessentially Canadian.  The issue that I find with a lot of restaurants set in nice locations is that their food is mediocre given that they are riding on their nice location to bring customers in.  Not so with River Cafe.  We came by after the lunch hour on a weekend and were situated in a perfect spot next to the windows. My girlfriend ordered the french toast, which was perfectly fluffy and delicious. I ordered the Bison burger, which was equally as tasty.  Can't wait to be back again.  Maybe for desserts or even on a patio as Dale E. had suggested."}
{"text":"Looking at this place online explains itself. Beautiful decor, great staff and although it's pricey, the food is very good. I had lamb and was not disappointed. The portions feel small initially however they serve the perfect amount of food to make you leave very satisfied. Great date place or nice dinner out!"}
{"text":"We were invited by friends to celebrate a special anniversary with them at the River Café in December and it was really nice.  We had a great dinner evening and the restaurant was done in twinkly mini white lights and felt very cozy and special.  We have dined here before and found the service and food was exceptional.  We would come back here to celebrate special occasions and it was really nice when we walked over the bridge to the island.  There was an area where music was playing and people skating on a special pond area under the evening lights.  This restaurant is really nice in the summer when everything is green and sometimes you see Canada geese in the park.  Very enjoyable !"}
{"text":"Totally smitten with this place. Stunning location combined with a thoughtful and interesting menu. Had the big taste lunch menu and was so impressed with the quality, presentation, and flavor of the food. Super romantic for date night or bring in the in laws for brunch and beautiful views of prince's island. Definitely stands out in the Calgary restaurant scene, no wonder it's got as much hype as it does."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting on an island in the Bow River. Go early and walk around the island park. Dinner was great. Wife and I sat outside on the patio overlooking the Bow River. Good service and very good food. They try to use locally source food items whenever possible. Also try their other restaurant, Deane House."}
{"text":"The place is outstanding - fresh seasonal locally sourced food, perfectly prepared in an unpretentious environment. What more could you want?!  The interior is warm, cozy, and spotlessly clean. The view of the park is very nice. Waitstaff were slow and a bit bland, but, they got the job done so I cannot complain.  I had the bison burger with bacon - a fine example of a high end artisan burger able to stand up to anything NYC's best burger joints have to offer.   River Cafe is a gem in Calgary and the locals should be proud."}
{"text":"Worst service and food I've had in a long time! Waited at the hostess stand for ages with a wriggling toddler in hand. Waited ages for the waitress to tend the table. Food tasted awful. Over salted cabbage soup, and a \"flatbread\" that looked like a frozen kids pizza.-coming from a chef. .... still waiting for the waitress to bring the check... I'll be here..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the epitome of comfortable upscale dining. I have never felt uncomfortable while dining here and the food sets the bar very high. The staff at the River Cafe are meticulous and dedicated to customer satisfaction.  The flavours are very savoury. Each time I visit, I order the fish and I am never disappointed. The flavours are rich and balanced, and my tastebuds are left tantalized. I always walk away satisfied, full and ready to go back soon after.    The atmosphere is quiet and formal, which I appreciate after a long day. You never see children, so this is a suitable place for a mom and dad's night out or a date night for young adults. I always recommend this restaurant as a dining experience for friends who are visiting from out of country or even out of town.   The resilience of the restaurant and staff shown after the horrendous flooding of the Bow River in 2013 is just a true show of what a strong competitiveness is held here. This establishment is respected for a reason, and will always have me as a returning customer."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday. I ordered the Fish and Game Board and it gives you a selection of different meats. The environment was very soothing. Would recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio and service was nice, so those earn stars. Now for the unfortunate food: the bison burger was a bust ... lots of awkward ingredients meshed together with the stinkiest cheese you'll ever smell (and I mean stop the conversation level stink). Just disappointing and overpriced for lunch. The fish was descent but served at room temp. Why can't I find hot food in this city? Anyway, that's a different story. Also wish they served warm (instead of cold) bread. All in all, not worth the hype that precedes this Calgary 'institution'."}
{"text":"Ok, I'd like to give this place a better review.  Hell, for awhile, this WAS my go-impress-the-gal resto that I would bring a first date to as my way of impressing her.  One of my co-workers actually created the memorable ad campaign that River Cafe has used for the last 8 years.  It's still one of the better places to go for wild game cuisine, and it's well rated for the food.  Boar and Bison figure highly in the menu, and it's imaginative and unique. The wine selection is absolutely wonderful and various, but more importantly, the decor and atmosphere is absolutely romantic and intimate.   But... while I can see why most people would rate this all as a 4 and 5 star, I just can't.  Food that is supposed to not only wow, shock and awe.  But somehow, it just doesn't have that especial touch that I experienced at Rouge or Charcut.  I'm just not wowed at all as the flavour is decent, but just not dreamy and stunning.    So I would say this is more of a 3.5 rating, for the place itself, but as I am not overly impressed despite the game meat elements, it's worth it for an good impression I suppose, but not necessarily a stunning one.  The only other resto in town I would say the same about where the environment trumps the food would probably be Sky360 on top of the Calgary Tower."}
{"text":"My first time ever trying The River Cafe and I must say I was not happy. I wasn't displeased, I just wasn't completely satisfied. The restaurant itself is beautiful, love the setting a definite 5 stars. The service started off so great, our server was helpful and informational but then he sort of stop coming by and I hate having to flag down servers when you need them. So for service I would say 3, I couldn't help but feel like the people that work there are too good to serve you. And for the food I would have to give them 2.5 stars. The main reasons are the food is way overpriced, just way way overpriced. I waited an hour for my entree dish and then when you get it your just expecting something spectacular, a burst of flavour and awesomeness in your mouth. And I did not get that at all. I've have better at cheaper prices. The River Cafe, a good place to try at least once, definitely. But once is good enough."}
{"text":"Excellent location, delicious food, and good service... What else would you like?... We had the risotto as an appetizer and the duck and pork chops as main dish... I still don't know which one was better!!.. The dessert was really good as well and the wine was great!... There was not one thing that do not deserve the 5 stars. I think this should be one of the top 5 restaurants in Calgary!"}
{"text":"It's certainly expensive and not always beyond astonishing service. However, that being said I've also had amazing service at river cafe. The simple truth is, though, that it's amazing food that's very well made and thought up. Worth the splurge."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch and it was fabulous! Service was great and food was amazing! Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Really nice food! We came as a group and the meal was set, but it was very good. The mixed greens salad was excellent, and the bison was outstanding.  The desert was not bad (it was a meringue fruit dish).  Some of my colleagues had the tuna albacore, which they enjoyed.  Others found the duck to be a bit dry.  It's a very nice restaurant in a nice area of the city."}
{"text":"Great quality, but service can be a bit patchy. Walked out on them this past summer after sitting at the table we were shown to for 20 mins being ignored by various wait staff. Maybe we were in some no-man's land between table allocations."}
{"text":"For those of you who have never been to Calgary, it is a city of about 1 million people. It is a very clean and modern city of technology and oil, it is within Alberta in Canada. The wonderful thing about Canada, is it's clean untouched beauty and if you're coming from California you'll notice the water.   Calgary doesn't EVEN have places with only beer and wine (this annoys me to no end here), if they have a liqor license, that means they serve it all, no restrictions.   In Calgary you can find The Bow River heading through the city. The Bow has an island and it's called Prince's Island not to be confused with Princess (which many locals erroneously say).   On that island are cultural or even things like lilac festivals or music concerts and all kinds of amazing things. You can roller blade or bike ride along the path and you'll no doubt share them with some Canada geese (Not Canadian Geese that would be technically wrong) and ducks, but in your exploring you also may find the River Cafe.  The River Cafe is a beautiful spot to stop, it could be while you're bike riding just for a tea, or it could be dinner or lunch. The style is rustic and not fast food, but I should mention you're welcome there no matter what your attire is.         Once upon a time my attire was a bridal gown, and I got married there. It was a very special day, and it's a very special place. If you ever have the chance to dine or just sit and listen to Ella Fitzgerald on the patio there, do take it in, it's absolutely lovely.

{"text":"I was lucky enough to be taken to River Cafe on my birthday.  It was a wonderful birthday lunch with delicious food and a gorgeous setting.  They have a lovely patio which lets you really enjoy all the beauty of Prince's Island Park.  The inside is just as nice as the outside and has the perfect ambiance for this upscale restaurant.  The staff members are all very professional and meet the standards of this posh restaurant.  The service is fast and memorable.  Our waiter was patient with us while we made our decisions and even made a few recommendations for us obvious newbie's!  I don't think I would visit here on a regular basis, but was happy to be taken on my birthday.  River Cafe seems to be a place for special occasions... or for the rich.  Their menu items are actually quite pricey.  That being said, they quality of food meets its price.  It's delicious and different.  I enjoyed a platter of many different meats including salmon and rabbit.  I was unsure about the rabbit at first, but it was actually quite tasty, and I would definitely try it again!  River Cafe is a great way to spend an afternoon.  It meets the expectations of a high class restaurant, but is sure to put a dent in your bank account."}
{"text":"I go to this restaurant not really for the food but for the ambience.  It's always worth a try if you're into a good space to be in.  Gorgeous place for a special supper."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great, location is amazing. It's a lovely bright spot with great food. The service was the only minor drawback. Our server always found a really inopportune moment to come by and repeatedly interrupted us mid-conversation without waiting even a second, making strange remarks on several occasions. It was a bit much. Other than that, it was a very nice meal.  I'm sure that had we had a server with better manners, it would have been a perfect brunch. I would return."}
{"text":"Why have we never been there? I'm a bit cautious about telling you our experience, because we want to be able to get a table. (Sorry, that's selfish...)  Wow, was this a great time! The restaurant is in Princess Island Park. The building is beautiful and rustic. The tables on the patio DON'T WOBBLE! (They pay attention to detail.) The food? Loved it! We had the red lentil hummus as an appy and the halibut as our entrees. When you go, you'll be able to explore their extensive wine list. The flavors are fantastic.  Say hi to Jen for us."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star experience! Most memorable dish was the red lentil hummus starter with toasted pita---delicious!!  Wild Boar and Duck Breast also very good, not stupendous and the service was a bit slow so can't give that 5th star but a very good dinner for sure and the ambiance is definitely a big plus!  Check it out, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful place to dine (especially for brunch). Being in the middle of the park, surrounded by the trees, river & beautiful scenery is enough on its own! But aside from the wonderful ambiance, the restaurant is lovely. Very cozy yet Canadian chic.   The service was wonderful and the ingredients used for the meal were extremely fresh and well cooked. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Fine dinning . . . . I'm still not tasting it.    We've been here a few and so far they seem to be lacking something. For these kind of prices the food should be something that makes me want to keep going back. Something so tasty I don't mind spending the extra money. It's not happening.   Come on; 21 dollars for a bison burger and a salad! It should be a spectacular burger and salad for that much, but it's not.  The service could be better too, the wait staff are fairly arrogant probably because the restaurant is so full of itself. Try a little humility.  Can't beat the location too bad about the situation."}
{"text":"I love the location.  Many people don't realize it's also open in the winter.  Definitely try it year round: in the winter it's very cozy with the fireplace roaring.  I love their seasonal menus, and the staff is tip top.  I've gone for full dinners, brunch, lunch, and even just to have a hot chocolate, and all times they've treated me just as well regardless of how little or how much I've spent.  One of my favorite places in Calgary to eat."}
