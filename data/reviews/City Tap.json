{"text":"Extremely disappointed in service. I've been here a few times before and sat at the bar and service was great. This time we decided to sit at the table. We get greeted fairly quickly, but she just threw menus at us. She didn't introduce herself. I asked her for the beer list (because obviously they're known for having great beers) and she gave me a sigh and went and got one. After 5 minutes she never came back so I ordered a drink from the bar, paid, and sat back down at my table.  Twenty minutes go by and we've been ready to order. Our server had 3 other tables (which I know you can handle if you're a good server, coming from an experienced bartender/server myself) and she not once acknowledged that we were ready to order. All of the other tables got their good and we hadn't even ordered yet. I saw her back in the kitchen flirting with the cooks and eating leftover fries.  At this time I grew impatient. I went up to the bar and asked if we could get waited on. The same server comes back and apologizes, since she thought we ordered food from the bar. I'm sorry, but, why would I order good from the bar and go sit back down at the table. That is just horrible communication.   Server took our order, didn't write anything down, so I knew everything was going to be messed up. And sure enough, nothing was cooked right, sides were wrong, but I was so hungry I forced myself to eat it. Probably won't go back. And if I do, I will request not to be served by the black girl with dreads (since she never told is her name, that's all I can say about her)"}
{"text":"Great beer selection at good prices. The food is nothing special but it is quick and easy if you're stopping somewhere before a game.   Try a pumpkin bomb if they have them!"}
{"text":"Decent beer selection on tap, however, the quesadillas gave me and my wife extreme stomach pain"}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. The food is inconsistent and the service is poor. I am done with this place due to the poor and unfriendly service."}
{"text":"Strolled in here last night. Power Hour from 8pm-9pm ($2 for any pint) Wow! Got a Fatheads and Loose Cannon for $4. Also, always a nice place to watch the game."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here for a quick bite and a beer before the Indian's game one night, and highly regret this decision.  Granted, it was a Saturday night before the game, but we arrived at 5:15 and missed the first pitch two hours later.  Our waitress we could tell was so stressed because she was so overworked.  How could you not have enough staff working on a night like that?  That was only the start of our problem.  When we complained after an hour of our food not coming, she kept reassuring us that it would be out soon.  Another half hour later, our food was brought out by the MANAGER without even a hint at an apology.  When the waitress came back, we asked to speak to the manager again to complain.  His response was that the ticket was in only 40 minutes earlier, so his staff was not at fault and that we would make it to the game on time (obviously not).  Out of the \"kindness of his heart\" he said he would give us free drinks and a 10% discount.  Seriously?!?!  When we said that there was no way we would make it to the game on time, he then said his final offer was to take 25% off, which we settled for.  We later realized he put the drinks BACK ON and took 25% off, so we would've been better off the first time!  Not wanting to miss the entire game at this point, we just decided to pay and leave.  Will be going to the Winking Lizard next game, stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"charged me an extra $2.00 for ice in my drink...are you kidding me?? jack on the rocks and a $2 surcharge for \"on the rocks\""}
{"text":"40 beers on tap and the selection changes. A nice relaxed atmosphere especially around Cavs and Indians games. Have a $3 beer of the day and $1 off during happy hour."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer before or after an Indians or Cavs game. Large selection that changes so never boring. They serve decent bar food but go for the beer!"}
{"text":"Come in during power and struggled the entire time to get a drink. They post a sign that says \"all beers under $6 are $2\" but apparently this is not true and you they will not tell you this till after you order."}
{"text":"Good spot in cleveland, the decor behind the bar is pretty nice too. There's empty liquor bottles with bright LED lights behind them. My first impression was on a busy night so it's hard to review the service. BUT...  However, i would NOT eat here. From stools me and my friends were sitting at we could completely see behind the kitchen. it made me sick to see the \"cooks\" wearing no gloves going from touching their cell phones, to the fryer, to the other workers, to someones plate and then continuing to touch THE FOOD all without gloves. Kitchen looked dirty all around.   Nice bar, good decor, just DONT eat there."}
{"text":"Went here for the end of a tribe game and had a great experience. For some reason craft beers were only $3 that night. Great deal and great service from the bartender.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We were walking around downtown on a Saturday night, trying to find a unique place to enjoy a fun time. We stumbled upon City Tap, and they were airing the UFC ppv for free.   They were really busy, and we were waited on accordingly. It wouldn't have hurt to employ a few more workers, but hey, beggars can't be choosers, right?   The beer selection was amazing. While we just went there for drinks, the food smelled delicious.   Sidenote: Cleveland had a really bad storm that night. It down poured for 45 minutes. The City Tap must have direct TV because I cut out during the main event and didn't come back on, at all."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are decent, which is unfortunate considering how horrendous the service is. If you feel like being ignored, but still having to pay money for being here, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We tried City Tap before a Monsters game for dinner and drinks. The renovations to the place are great and the beer selection is to notch. Unfortunately, that doesn't compensate for the service.  With the new look amd name came a new menu and we ordered a variety of wings and burgers. About an hour later, on a slow Tuesday night we finally received our order. You'd think we would be ecstatic to receive our food but when the food came out I would have rather eaten the menu I ordered it from. The 7 chicken wings received didn't quite meet the 10 ordered because the parmesean garlic sauce on them was borderline inedible. What left an even more sour taste in my mouth was we were charged full price when it was wing night. A sad part of the renovation is they didn't fix the hood in the kitchen leaving you with a stench of fried food for the remainder of the night.  PROS Beer selection Location  CONS Service Food Prices"}
{"text":"I have yet to eat here, good place to go for drinks.  Great draft beer selection, and their power hour is a deal. They had a Revolution Brewing beer on tap the past two times I've been there. One of my favorite places to go around the Gateway District."}
{"text":"Spotty service but the music was good. Very good beer selection."}
{"text":"Went to city tap before last nights cavs game to check it out. I love good beer and with 40 taps and the name city tap i figured it would be a place i would enjoy. The beer selections was decent but didn't understand why a craft beer bar would have bud light and miller light signs everywhere. Service was extremely slow. When i got my food the fries were under cooked and my burger was over cooked. Not a great experience. The layout is nice and with 40 taps this place could be great. There was no manager presence and basically service was a free for all. I hope they work out the kinks because if they re not careful they will be closing just like the other 5 bars have in that same location."}
{"text":"I just arrived in Cleveland and this was the closest place to walk for dinner.   If I were a big beer connoisseur I'm sure I'd love it but since I'm not, nor am I a Browns fan, this wasn't the place for me.   My waitress was attentive and polite, in between shots. The food was good though the fries were cold and it was a loud party type atmosphere."}
{"text":"Walked in on a fairly busy saturday. Took 25 minutes to get our first drink in our hands after sitting at the bar, which was a bad sign. We went to stake out a bar to watch the MLB playoffs, and asked if they'd put the sound on before we went in and had the rest of our party meet us. They did put the game on the TV, but another guy came after we already had ordered food/drinks and decided that they weren't putting sound on unless it was the world series.   Would have been nicer to know before we had our 20 person party on their way to the bar - and there was another group of at least 10 that were watching the game too - sounds like putting the volume on would have been a better business decision. Found a bar down the street that we collectively spent over $2500 at during the course of the next 6 hours who happily catered to the request of sound. Perhaps they should re-consider calling themselves a sports bar if they'd rather have kid rock on the juke box all day.   Pros: Wings were great, pulled pork tacos were good, bar back with the dreads was a nice dude and was working hard  Cons: Stupid wait times, poor planning to have 1 bartender."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome beer selection! Service is terrible. Doesn't matter if there's a game downtown or the place is completely empty.   I'd grab a beer here but don't plan to stick around."}
{"text":"Overall decent.  Amazing beer selection, with 40+ on draft.  Have had the burger before, which was great.  Grilled chicken sandwich leaves something to be desired, the meat tastes like it had been microwaved instead of grilled.  Ample bar space, with an outdoor seating area as well.  Servers are attentive, without being annoyingly in your face every couple seconds."}
{"text":"Great place to stop before a Tribe game! $6 beer sampler and the buffalo flatbread was excellent."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Gateway. Huge number of beers on tap, quick service, and great prices. They have great specials like the Power Hour. A must stop before an Indians or Cavs game."}
{"text":"I've been to City Tap a couple of times, generally when I'm in the downtown area for an event. I am definitely impressed by their beer selection. Like, WOW. I actually had a hard time deciding which one to pick because there were so many choices.  Standard pub-fare food. I generally get burgers at sports bars, and this time was no exception. Interesting choices though, I seem to remember getting something with a fried egg on it...  Service was pretty good, even when it was busy. Which, to be honest, it wasn't as busy as I expected it to be. Regardless, our server was attentive but not a hoverer.   I find it a little weird that people can just walk through a restaurant, and I'm pretty sure I saw a few homeless people wander into the bathrooms, but whatever. I wish there was more seating available for large groups as well, because every time I've been there a huge group has been blocking the bar area. The rest of the place could be empty, but there they are...  Overall, not a bad place. I'm sure we will go again the next time we're downtown."}
{"text":"This is your average bar to hang out at before or after a game or concert downtown. The service isn't so good but the beer selection is large and the Viking burger I ordered was delicious even though it was overcooked. The wings are over sauced so if you are like me and don't need them slathered, ask for the sauce on the side.   The upside they have power hour every weekday from 8-9pm which is $2 for all drafts and bottles!"}
{"text":"City Tap is most definitely a sports bar with a heavy \"bro\" vibe. When the Black Dog disappointed far too many times, this became the \"after work beer\" spot, which is acceptable, but annoying. Sometimes it's a fight just to get through the door, then there are no bar spots available, so you end up standing around, chugging your beer instead of wallowing while sitting at the bar. Not ideal for a \"my job is stressing me out\" drink.   As far as service goes, it gets a little disappointing, but that also can be credited to the fact that this place tends to be a nuthouse. The selection of beer is great and the prices are pretty standard, so I certainly can't complain about that.   Problem: the bathroom is UPSTAIRS. Difficult for a variety of reasons. And when I finally got up there, some lady was hogging the space, yelling about child support and shootings with some poor soul on the other end of the phone line.   Summary: It's OK when in a pinch, but not my favorite place."}
{"text":"2 stars...1 for the beer selection and 1 for the waitresses/bartender.  DON'T come here if you want to eat.  Food is just plain nasty.  They advertise the \"hand crafted\" burgers as the main draw.  Well even if they got my burger order right (WHICH THEY DIDN'T) in my opinion the burger quality is not something I would advertise.  Edible, but not good.  Fries were greasy AND soggy, same with the onion rings.  They also tasted like they needed to change the fry oil...blah.  Beer was good and the server was nice and discounted the bill."}
{"text":"Decent draft list. Service was decent. $7.50 for a Jose on the rocks and $9.50 for an angels envy on the rocks. Didn't try the food, but the kitchen is located right behind the bar and open. Not a bad experience but probably wouldn't make a special trip back here."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town. I spent 3 hours at this bar. IT'S EXCELLENT. Let me tell you why.   Okay, so, the 40 taps are awesome. I'm a beer nerd from Boston so being in a new city and a new state, I like to try as many local beers as possible. They had two local beers - Great Lakes and Fathead - as well as some other beers not distributed to Boston. Now, Boston doesn't do happy hour so when I walked in, grabbed a stool with a great view of the Bruins-Blackhawks game and they then told me from 8-9pm that all drafts were nearly $2, I nearly wept. When I walked in the bar was pretty crowded for some March Madness/after work stress release. I could see this place being an absolute ZOO during Tribe season.  I was also pretty hungry so I grabbed their Black Swamp burger, medium rare. Told em to forget about the bun (I'm a bit health conscious/carb avoidant...I save the carbs for the beer) and sub in sweet potato fries (for a $1). So, the burger is ridiculously delicious, perfectly cooked, totally awesome. Then we get to the sweet potato fries - now, maybe it's because I just spent 2.5 months in SC at Basic Combat Training for the US Army and I am unaccustomed to anything that remotely tastes good, but these SP fries were OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD. The fries themselves were amazing, but they came with some sort of maple flavored mayo/butter/I don't know what concoction that made me eat said fries like I haven't eaten in three weeks. I asked for an extra container of whatever that magic elixir was and I'm not a big condiment person whatsoever. That shit was like crack.  So, when the beers aren't being $2, they're very reasonably priced - lots of options under $4. My only complaint is that you have to walk up to their (very large) tap board behind the bar to get a full sense of their taps. They do have a printed menu for about half their taps, but I like knowing where they're made, the style, the ABV, etc without having to awkwardly hover next to some people trying to get their drink on as well. That being said, I could pretty much see the whole tap board from my seat so it wasn't really that bad.   **This is the part I most want to share with Yelp. THE STAFF. WAS. AWESOME. So attentive, so friendly, so accommodating. I have found all of Cleveland to be exceptionally nice (I'm from NJ and we are actually a very nice and friendly species; Boston is cold and rude and unforgiving sometimes so I think I'm just used to my waitstaff and bartenders being arrogant pricks) but the two servers that took care of me (and the random couple from KY that happened to sit down next to me, they were awesome too) were crazy great. Always asking me if I needed another beer or water or anything, made sure I got to watch the Bruins, and when I did order another beer it got there in about 2 minutes. Like, zero wait time. Like, City Tap, if you're reading this...give your servers a high five. Or a bonus. Everyone kicked ass. Or bring them to Boston, I will give y'all the hook up.  Upstairs area has more seating and a pool table which I did not get to partake in but I am in Cleveland through Saturday so there is still time to change that.   Basically, this bar is 2 feet from my hotel and I could not be any more pleased about it. I will send everyone I know to this bar and when we come back, I will absolutely, I mean ABSOLUTELY be back."}
{"text":"Best beer place we found in Cleveland.  Wonderful selection, though they really should take down the signs of beer that they are out of.    We stopped in around 5 in the afternoon and the bar was packed.  Came back after the Indians game and we found a spot at the bar but the tables were packed.    We shared an order of the wings with the Guinness BBQ.  They were quite good but not at all spicy.  We also shared the hummus with veggies.  It was a little weird because along with the broccoli, carrots and celery there were untypical dipping veggies like cucumber and tomato.  They were good, we just had to use a fork!  All in all, our favorite bar in Cleveland.  The only problem, the staff seemed completely uninterested in serving customers.  At first I thought that it was just us because we were obviously tourist and a little older than the rest of the crowd, but after watching for a while it became apparent that whatever sports were on was far more interesting than the paying guests."}
{"text":"Great place to watch an away Indians game.  Bar service is very good even when it gets crowded.  The bartenders are quick to start you a tab or have you close out with cash as you go.  They must have a lot of people who ditch put on bar tabs... Food here is mediocre at best.  Skip it.  Home Browns games do not draw a large crowd so if you are looking for a bar downtown to watch a non-Browns game it is a good option.  Lots of drinks on tap."}
{"text":"I came here on a week night for drinks after dinner, so we didn't eat here. I spotted it while driving through downtown earlier that day and through the window all I saw was beer taps on taps on taps. That's all it takes to get me into a place!  They have a lot of deals, so follow them on Twitter because thats where they announce daily specials. I went for the 3 different 6 oz. beers for $6 special, which was perfect. You can try a bunch of different beers for pretty cheap this way.  The bar is decorated pretty cool. The upper level has beer taps all around the bottom and the beer tap list is really big and central on the wall, which is great because we don't have to worry about menus at all!  The manager was cool too. It wasn't too busy so we talked with him a bit. I'm psyched to go back here!"}
{"text":"Would somebody tie my shoes!! This place is cool!! The A/C is on a lil too high for my tasting. And fortunately today that taste ain't chicken. I mealed there yesterday and I would say the service is a 3 and the meals and pricing is a 4 (rounding down). The perfect way to say this next sentence is that the pork and fish tacos taste fantastic. -_- YELP!"}
{"text":"Part of a self-directed Pub Crawl in the Gateway District, City Tap has a great beer selection.  It was quiet when I was there and the bartender was right on me when I sat down.  This is another permanent stop on the Cleveland Pub Crawl Olympics (I made that name up to justify anything stupid I might do on the pub crawl).  Anyway, this is a very comfortable, clean and interesting place.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"My go-to bar! Great beer selection, awesome food, clean atmosphere and excellent service! Not to mention who can beat $2 draft and bottled beer M-F from 8-9 p.m?"}
{"text":"Aaron is a competent bartender.  I ordered the shrimp tacos which are extremely tasty.  However I didn't receive my side of Skittles so... 4 stars."}
{"text":"Caesar Salad & Bang Bang Shrimp tacos were good. Lots of beer choices, and great sports decor."}
{"text":"This is my local watering hole, my go-to sports bar, and my favorite happy hour for craft beers. With a deal called \"power hour\" where ALL bottles and drafts are $2 from 8-9pm M-F, it is hard to go anywhere else! Very attentive servers/bartenders and a second floor balcony upstairs with a pool table. I love this chill atmosphere and the location is perfect before/after games. I'm giving it 5 stars because as a regular, I have had a lot of amazing times here!"}
{"text":"3.25-3.5 stars: It's definitely a sports bar crowd and a sports bar atmosphere.  It nice that they have so many tv screens and bar seats.  They also have a few pool tables upstairs, which gives it the ultimate dive bar feel.      The service is pretty attentive and they have pretty good happy hour deals (2.00 drafts and well drinks!).  I can't say that I am super impressed with their selection, but its decently stocked.    I came in during an OSU game, definitely a busy night and jam-packed to where you can't even move.  Can we say fire hazard? Despite, how busy it was, our waitress always kept our drinks full.  They have a very typical bar food selection (wings, sandwiches, etc).  It's good if you are close by and are too lazy to go anywhere special."}
{"text":"Had a party of six Saturday night great service and a great selection of draft beer appetizers were great staff was great and very friendly keep up the great work ."}
{"text":"If you don't like sitting at bars I have two things to tell you: 1) stop going to bars if you don't like sitting at them and 2) good luck in this place because it's basically one huge bar setup.   The beer selection is HUGE. Usually large beer selections overwhelm me, but the humongous board that details all their offerings was interesting. I also dig the way they showcase their liquor - very neat.   Anywho, my dad and I saddled up to the bar and ordered some Great Lakes and grub. We both ordered burgers and sweet potato fries and were pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't consider myself a connoisseur of burgers by any means, but I do have a tendency to dislike them. I gravitate toward build your own burger menus simply because I enjoy topping burgers with ridiculous amounts of extras...I will now note that I never order burgers with burger lovers because I know my habits would deeply offend them. The pretzel bun that I received is what made it I believe; I have a soft spot for really, really good bread.   Overall there was nothing that made this place memorable, but there was nothing that set me off either. A solid experience, and I may come back the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Been through most of the changes from Fish Bones to the now City Tap. Luv the new layout. The new design makes it feel very open.I Especially luv that all 40 taps are back. Great selection of beers and drinks. The bartenders are awesome. If your undecided they'll hook you up with something good. Great place for Happy Hour, before the game or just for hanging out."}
{"text":"I came in last night after work with a few coworkers, and we had an awesome time! Eric took care of us, and was more than happy to describe and suggest beer. He was very friendly, and a super hard worker! There were a few times I was about to ask for something, and he had already anticipated my needs. I was really blown away by the amazing service he gave every person that walked through the door! Thanks for the fun night, and the awesome sour ale suggestion Eric!"}
{"text":"I went to City Taps after an Indian Game! Now the bartenders were nice. They seem to have a nice selection of beer.  Their late night menu is grease city. I guess what do I expect from a bar. I had never been there and I asked one of the members of the kitchen staff where I ordered food ( wasn't sure if a waitress came along) he goes very rudely the bar.  I ordered the tator tots which were three bucks. Then I ordered cheese and bacon for an additional three bucks and there was hardly any cheese.  I wouldn't mind stopping in there for a few brews but would never eat there again!"}
{"text":"Ok, it had a good beer selection, the food was fine, it was relatively inexpensive, and they have tvs.   But the real entertainment was the clientele.    On one side of us, there was a guy watching baseball who was taking the game way too personally.  Kind of to the point, that I'm sure he could be arrested if the cops saw what he keeps in his fridge.  Then there was this guy who had an appreciation night for his employees (classy guy who takes his employees to City Tap), and I'm pretty sure only half were over 21 and the other half must have had passable fake IDs.  And the creepy guy who was trying to get his underage employees drunk was the drunkest one in the group.    The best drunk guy was the one who asked if the bar takes credit cards before he ordered 2 more beers.  Yeah, you've already bought drinks because you're obviously loaded, so I'm sure they haven't changed the rules in the past 10 minutes.  Then it took him about 7 minutes (and I think that's a conservative estimate) to sign his bill.  When he put it back on the bar and left, his tip and signature looked like a seismology graph.  Plus he forgot to take his credit card.  In the corner was the most depressing bachelorette party ever that took a TABLE in a section by themselves.  Lucky guy.  I wouldn't go back for 2 reasons: I don't live in Cleveland and I don't expect to ever be there again; and I want to quit while I'm ahead."}
{"text":"3.5 stars A sports bar that sports a rather fun layout.  Many screens, spread out amongst 2 floors with multiple terraces makes for a fun space to interact with others.  Beer selection is mediocre-decent, and food selection is also solid.  As a culinary experience, the venue is average, but as a place to hold a party or meet up with friends, it's decent.  Pricing is average."}
{"text":"A group of us were happy to stumble upon this place on a Thursday night. This was the only place alive!! We went to two other bars before that were completely dead! If you are going to go out during the week I highly recommend parking your keister right here. There were a lot of people there that seemed like regulars. Everyone was very friendly. The prices are affordable and the atmosphere is just cool. You will know what I mean when you check it out!"}
{"text":"Great bar downtown.  For sure, the power hour they offer is one of the best deals in Cleveland.  The staff is great, and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos, chicken wings, grapefruit traveller beer, victory moonglow = super awesome!!"}
{"text":"Amazing list of craft brews on tap! I tried a Thirsty Dog Siberian Night Imperial Stout.  The bartender was very cool & was pleased that I ordered a bowl of Guinness Chilli which is homemade.  The chilli has a spicy bite but the imperial stout takes the edge off.   All in all this is a great bar restaurant & I plan to return.  I'm here at the lunch hour on a Saturday so just a few patrons around.  TVs all around:  this is a great bar restaurant !"}
{"text":"Friendly and efficient staff, they have an extensive beer selection, pricing is very fair and they have the only late night menu in the area and their food rocks your socks for your traditional bar food, etc I have been here a hundred times and never a bad experience!"}
{"text":"Checked out City Tap after a Saturday night Monster's game.  I'm not a huge beer fan so I can't speak about those although the selection seems large and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Walked in dinner time and got a seat right away. The waitress helped us pick our beers out because we were not familiar with a bunch of the craft beers they had. She was great and got us our beers quick. We ordered our food and that came out fast as well. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and it was pretty good with a great rosemary mayo dressing.  My friend had the shrimp tacos and he was very happy.  If I go back to Cleveland I will be back. Very reasonable priced and they have good happy hour drink specials."}
{"text":"In a city where hardly any food options are available after 10pm, City Tap is still a horrible option. I would have been better off getting something from the vending machine at my hotel or from the grocery section of the downtown CVS pharmacy. Bartenders were clueless, and more interested in stacking glasses than serving patrons. Menu options were no better than a McDonalds. A place like this has such a great opportunity to fill a niche and create something cool. Instead, they settle for merely being open until 2:00.   Cleveland rocks?  Not after 10pm..."}
{"text":"Man what a saving grace this place existed during the RNC. What I'd call something like a dive bro bar, City Tap offers a good selection of beer and a wide array of bar type food options. The service was outstanding and friendly. I stopped in here every day during the conventions and it felt like home. Will be back if I ever go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good place to get cheap good food and beers before a game.  Great selection of local brews on tap."}
{"text":"Food is good, staff is friendly but management is not present. Watched kitchen staff chill with their friends? Family? Eating Chinese food with their hands and screaming throughout our 20 mins there. And thats after bringing this to staff & management attn. Needless to say we won't be back. Too bad, Viking burger rocks."}
{"text":"Food, ok Service, awful on my visit  I visited recently with coworkers. We sat at the bar, the service was slow    .  I wouldn't complain if there weren't three bartenders and about a third of the bar seats empty.   Food and drink were fine.  The bar itself is pretty cool. Just don't try to use the men's room and expect privacy.  The door opens right out to the bar so any other patron can see you inside.  Additionally, the men's room lacked a stall, it was all urinals.  Apparently there is a regular restroom, but it was locked."}
{"text":"The wings and beer selection is pretty good, but a fair experience went to awful because of a lunatic employee. I was visiting from out of town, and not my first time. I asked to pick up two tabs and the bartender said no; I found this odd.  I would assume any establishment would want to make $$.    I waited for another 20 min at the bar to pay my own tab.  I mentioned how poorly I thought the service was from this specific employee and he confronted me for a fight!!!  I was forced out of the establishment, which is nuts since I was literally a regular patron and paying!!  Speechless...  Post-Apocalyptic even.. literally no humanity from this rogue employee....    Never have I ever experienced treatment from any employee/establishment like I did at this place that I used to like..  Go to the Winking Lizard..  I've been there.  In comparison its better.  Include my experience and its just safer.  City Tap is not a friendly place."}
{"text":"I was truly looking forward to visiting the city of Cleveland one day because I'm a huge LeBron James fan and all about the revival of the city( I come from a city hurting for a revival as well, St.Louis, MO) as well as bringing a Championship home to Northeast Ohio. After hearing about my brother's experience at this  joke of an exablishment I have rethought my whole view on the city and plans to visit it. Why would I want to bring my business and money to a city who treats their of visitors like trash, this is not how we act here in the Lou. Thanks for setting a great example for the city of Cleveland!! I'm sure the whole city is not like this but I will be staying far from your establishment. By the way I read through all your reviews and it seems that your women bartenders being extremely rude is a trend..... I think a word to the wise would be to get rid of these wanna be punk rock girls to help your business. I saw you posted a verbal apology to my brother finally today only after the reflux of social media reviews, there was no sincereness to it, it was simply an attempt to protect your business. Hope this incident really makes you rethink how you run your establishment, because this horror story is completely unacceptable and something no one should ever have to go through."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and they have \"power hour\" where beers are $2. Really happy to see a Belgium Triple on the menu"}
{"text":"Came here after a disappointing Cavs game to unwind. The bar was filled with people eager to watch the NCAA March Madness games. This place is narrow so it's basically a long bar with a few small tables alongside. The wall behind the bar is decorated with bottles of liquor lit by colored LEDs, pretty cool look that is not overly done. They have quite a selection on draft and they feature $2 beers during their power hour (M-F 8-9pm), will need to come back for this sometime.   I ordered the honey siracha chicken sandwich along with fries and a head hunter IPA. The food arrived quickly and hot. The chicken breast was cooked well, the marinades and sauce went really well together. The siracha added a nice kick while the honey gives it a calming after taste. Overall a pretty good sandwich for less than 8 bucks."}
{"text":"Large and interesting beer selection, but the positives ended there. A few of the beers we sampled were stale tasting, and the food didn't achieve mediocrity, with a burger cooked to the consistency of a Kingsford briquette and fries that were limp with grease and ice cold. Good for a pregame beer but much better dining options nearby."}
{"text":"Good place to watch a UFC fight - food and service is ok - lots of tvs - gets crowded - pizza burger was cooked perfectly so good job chef"}
{"text":"We were in Cleveland visiting for my cousins wedding and luckily for us it overlapped the weekend of the Cavs/Hawks series in Cleveland. Since we knew getting tickets to the actual game was out of the budget, since we are huge sports fans, we wanted to be around the locals! Our hotel was walking distance from 'The Q' as they call it and right in front is what I like to coin as the 'Bar District.' LOL!  City Tap is right outside of the Q and perfect for watching sports, grabbing some bar food and tasting some pretty awesome beers. They have over 100 beers on tap, they don't keep a menu though because the beers change frequently. The atmosphere was just what we wanted: Cavs shirts and jerseys everywhere, lots of beer and ESPN on every TV. #Love.   We ordered loaded fries for an appetizer, my husband ordered the Barnyard Burger and I opted for the CLE BLT. All were GREAT. We got our appetizer with our food which kinda sucked but it was super busy and we got our food in good time so I won't complain about that. Our server was great and did all that he could to continue to check on us and other patrons as well. Good job for that because the place was PACKED.   The food was great, I loved the tomato & rosemary-bacon infused mayo that came on my CLE BLT. *drools a little bit* That was the highlight and it was just what I wanted!   Thank you City Tap for hosting non-Cleveland fans but sports fans without making us feel like we were traitors (take note Philly)."}
{"text":"Good food but inconsistent sometimes - especially with the barbecue sauce. It's so random. Great service. Good people."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times but up until my last two visits it's only been for drinks. They have a power hour from 8-9 where drinks are $2. Outside of the power hour they have a $3 beer of the day. But a couple weeks ago I had food for the first time here and o. m. g. !!! I had The Viking burger and its the best burger I believe I've ever had. I craved it for weeks and finally went back last night. Cooked how you like in their garlic parm wing sauce then topped with Swiss cheese, guac, mayo and scallions. I swear this burger melts in your mouth! The fries are awesome as well!   If I can force myself to not eat The Viking I think The Godfather will be my next choice.   The service is nice and pretty quick!  If you're in downtown cle and looking for a burger and/or some good bar food this place is definitely a place to go!"}
{"text":"If you love beer and you are downtown, then this is the place to go. I'm  not sure how many they have on tap but at least 30. They also have a bunch of bottled micro brews. I had Shock Top raspberry wheat and it was one of the best fruit beers I have ever had.. The folks slinging beer were real good about answering questions. Atmosphere was great, lots of people after work on a weeknight, definitely a great place downtown. I will be back"}
{"text":"What can I say about City Tap... hmmmm...  Well, let's start by sharing a little story of how I came to be here on a Saturday night.   We were hanging out with my friend who lives over on the extension of Huron, it was getting late and we wanted to go to a bar. The stipulation was that it was cold, snowy and none of us lazy asses wanted to walk very far. And then there was... you guessed it: City Tap.   After we scurried up the street, chatted with a crazy, homeless man screaming through the streets of Cleveland and waved to some cops watching him, we walked into this newish bar on the Euclid side.    As we opened the door, the strong smell of crab cakes hit us like a tidal wave. Not the first impression I was hoping for, but it got better after that at least. As we walked back through this long, skinny bar I started to notice the fun decor. It wasn't anything earth-shattering, but hip, cool and just fine for a sports bar. We found a table to hang at, dropped our coats off and headed for the bar.   Pleasant surprise #1: Yes, I realize this place is called \"City Tap\", but holy beer selection. This place isn't messing around. Granted, I had vodka, but if I were in a beer mood that night, that would have been a pretty convenient place to land.   Pleasant surprise #2: It wasn't super busy, but there was a bit of a crowd with only two bartenders that I could see. There was not one point in the entire night when I had to wait for service at the bar. None. Zip. Zero. Those 'tenders were quick, kind and on their game. For a sports bar with mostly beers and simply made cocktails, this is great. If you're looking for a hand-crafted cocktail, go somewhere else. (Duh)  Pleasant surprise #3: I paid for two people all night, plus some lingering cocktails for other friends periodically. I was expecting a ginormous tab, but was happy to see they were not asking for my left leg and first born child. Hmmm... me likey.   Overall, this is a sports bar--a nice, clean, new sports bar with pub grub and a huge beer selection. And for that purpose, it's a great place to check out. I didn't eat, so I can't comment on the food, but the time had there wasn't half bad. I wouldn't mind returning at some point, although I don't know if it would stick out in my mind as someplace I'd want to frequent.   Some things I could see being a problem in the future: parking. But that's the problem with all those places over there. Summer isn't so bad, but Cleveland winters are unforgiving on poor pedestrians."}
{"text":"Came here last night & Ordered the nachos and omg delicious!!! My favorite! They give u plenty too. Always great service."}
{"text":"A typical burger and beer joint that brings young and older crowds (The only restaurant that close later than 11pm in the area, so where else do you if you do not want to walk far or über). The food was okay. They have good happy hours prices and a heavy beer selection. The customer service is not that good, the bartenders attitude was off (Okay lets empathize, it's August and a lunch shift she probably dreaded) but a clear difference in how she interacted with her regulars, which seemed pretty personable and friendly. Considering the fact that this restaurant is near a tourist destination, you'd expect them to be a little more welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is right by the Quicken Loans Arena. I stopped in after having difficulty finding a place to eat after I attended an event at the Q. This place did not disappoint.  It is a nice size and the food was delicious. I ordered the Godfather Burger, which I highly recommend.  It was delicious.  The drink were also pretty good and they have a large selection.  The service was  also exceptional, which sets this bar apart from all the other bars on the block. This place has many TVs where you can catch sports and I highly recommend this place as a pregame to an event at the Q."}
{"text":"The place was welcoming. Great service and cold beer. I had chili and funnel cake fries. All in all a nice visit. We will come here again.  Check out the good variety of beers."}
{"text":"Great sports bar, MANY good and fresh beers on tap, and the food is not bad for bar food. Great atmosphere, lots of TV's and friendly service. Happy Hour prices are great on both beers and food, it's worth going a little early. All in all a great sports bar either after the game or any time!"}
{"text":"Imagine the scene.. a Trio of guys heading to a hockey game.. starving, and finding a 45 minute wait at a certain reptile nearby... So we wandered down the street to see what else might be nearby.   and found this gem. We were able to grab a spot very quickly, didn't need to worry about waiting and missing the beginning of the game.  The menu wasn't huge but still enough that 2 vegies and a meateater were all happy.   The drink menu looks pretty extensive.. I noticed that they have a beer of the day for a cheap price.. can't remember exactly what it was.. but I like that!    The burger menu is pretty awesome and what I enjoyed."}
{"text":"Our first time at City Tap and loved it! Plenty of beer choices to pick from and a lively atmosphere. We ordered lunch and we were quite impressed. The soup of the day was a tomato soup, so naturally I then had to order a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon! Throw some fresh cut fries on there and hello ... delicious! We also ordered the bang bang shrimp tacos and they were fantastic. Great first experience. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place is so fun, with a very socially  upbeat crowd ...its edgy its noisy  but A cool place to be seen and get your eat on....I ordered the Westside burger its like so good it had a rich  buttery parmesean sauce that the burger was sautéed  in OMG !!! So juicy perfectly cooked with fresh avacodo and white cheese had good bun too. I could eat this burger and those hand cut seasoned to perfection  fries everyday."}
{"text":"City Tap is my go-to for garlic Parmesan chicken wings. They are breaded little bites of heaven. Yesterday, we changed it up and got some loaded tater tots. Turned out to be a great and delicious choice. The beer selection here is one of the best. You walk in and see the large chalkboard with at least 30 beers on tap. The space itself is really narrow, so I wouldn't try going with a large group on a game day. There are two levels and the second level has some pool so you can get your game on! All in all, I frequent this place a lot, because I live close, but I think even if I didn't live near by, I would make this a standard stop on my way to a ball game!"}
{"text":"Expected much more given the prices and location.  The cheeseburger on the late night menu tasted like it'd been dipped in saltwater.  Which is a shame since the fries were quite nice.  Service was slow and ineffective (when we asked basic questions), and each person I interacted with thought that he or she is cooler than I am.  Which may be true...I'm not so cool...but isn't part of any training I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"Stopped here after the frozen diamond faceoff at progressive field. The place was packed, but that still doesn't excuse poor service. The waitress avoided our table for quite some time and after making eye contact with more than one member of our party. The food was typical bar grub. The beer selection was vast and decor was great. We chose this bar because of the convenient location to the venue and our hotel. Not bad, but nothing special. Service needs improvement."}
{"text":"I came here for some after dinner drinks on an off night (wednesday I think?) to check out how they re-did the place. I love the design, and they have an amazing collection of tap handles sprinkled around the place. The beer menu is extensive and they do probably the best job of any establishment of displaying it. All the beers are on huge signs shown large and proud above the bar, which makes picking beers easy.   However, by far the best part, is the deal where you can try 6 oz. of 3 beers for only 6 bucks. There's almost guaranteed to be a couple things you haven't tried before, and that's a solid price to sample many different things.   The staff was friendly and welcoming, and when I asked for a water to go the manager said he couldn't find any to-go cups so he just gave me a bottle of water on the house. Looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"We visited this venue twice yesterday! The first time we arrived we sat at a table by the bar and had a very sweet and attentive waitress. I didn't catch her name, but she was a young African American woman with long hair that was braided. She got our order right away and brought us our beer immediately. We each tried the Southern Tier Pumking beer and it was delicious! We split the loaded chicken nachos and they were ridiculously good. We were just stopping in on our way to a concert and it was a perfect shareable appetizer. The portion size was huge and the chicken was cooked perfectly.    While their beer menu is very extensive (40 beers on tap), it is easy to read and in large font above the bar. You are also provided with a printed menu upon request. The selection was very nice.  We returned after the concert we attended later that evening because most places seemed to be closing a bit early. We sat at the actual bar when we came back and the bartender, Laura M., was an absolute doll. Very sweet and checked on us often! We had the bang bang shrimp tacos and the cheeseburger which were on the late night menu. WE HAVE NEVER HAD A CHEESEBURGER THAT WAS COOKED MORE PERFECTLY. We were so impressed with this bar food. The bang bang shrimp tacos were spicy, crispy, and so, so great. If we're ever back in Cleveland, we will surely return.  *this place is also crazy cheap for the high quality of booze, staff, and food that you receive!"}
{"text":"Cleveland is a funny town. Has these bizzare rules that would make your head explode. Such as \"it is illegal in the state of OH to give samples out\". Ok fine, comply with it. Issue is that it started being legal to give samples in May of 2014. I thought it was such a rediculous rule that I decided to google it and thats how I found out it not illegal anymore. So either City Tap doesn't know or loves ripping its customers off and charging 2 dollar to sample 1 oz of beer.   I won't return to the joint again. I was generous with the star because I loved the amount of beers on tap as well as the decor of the place. I visit CLE alot but I think that there are better and more honest places around."}
{"text":"Staff very nice. Beer selection and prices great! Food.....not so good....even for \"bar food\" very under par.  We got wings and a quesadilla, chicken was rubbery in both...they were pretty bad."}
{"text":"Stopped in to City Tap after a long night out elsewhere in search of late night bar food.  Who knew it was so difficult to find drunk food in the wee hours of the morning in downtown Cleveland?  Had an order of the fried pickles and a few large glasses of water.  Can't say the food was anything spectacular, but it did the trick.  The thing that seemed odd to me was how bright the bar was.  Granted, I'd been in a dimly lit setting for most of the night, but holy retail store lighting, batman!  Not sure anyone should be in that kind of lighting so late at night.  Not sure I'd make a trip to specifically go to City Tap but it's a decent place to stop if you need some late night grub."}
{"text":"Bar wise, they have a very impressive selection. In fact I would give it 4.5 stars for the drinking portion. The reason for 3 stars was the food was terrible. It's very hard to screw up grilled cheese. The sandwich was very dry and lacked flavor. The fries looked like they could have been good but were almost burned. I didn't finish either, it was that bad. I'd give the food 1 star. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was enjoyable and the drinks ma were good which is why I gave them 3 stars"}
{"text":"I was only there for the \"power hour\", so that tempers my review. Monday-Friday they have ALL drafts and bottled (under $6) for $2 from 8-9pm. This is an amazing deal, undoubtedly. We managed to arrive at 8:30 and miraculously get in 2 beers each- I say miraculously because it was so busy and there were only 2 bartenders. We sat at the bar and understandably had a hard time flagging down the bartender. But for $8 for 4 craft beers of your choice, it's easy to overlook having to wait and other complaints. The draft selection is honestly really really good- but I would definitely not go there as a destination, as the regular prices were pretty steep. Overall the environment was not my style and I would probably only go to take advantage of the power hour offer. It was too loud, sports-centric, and full of bros for my taste."}
{"text":"Big drinks and open late, what more can you ask for?  Nice late night menu.  Had the grilled chicken sliders.  They were just ok...somewhat on the bland side.  Great beer selection and reasonable prices on food and beverages.  It was very packed when I got there and the service wasn't that great.  I think the bar tender was on the verge of a meltdown.  It was a Sunday night and most of the other restaurants or bars were either closed or stopped serving food.  City Tap was the only game in town for me that night.  The burgers looked great and so did the burrito plate...I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Was our first visit before heading to progressive field for the Indians game, we really enjoyed our food, was a good first visit, plus we loved the wall of bottles behind the bar! Only downside is, were out of the appetizer we wanted and my fries came out a little cold, plus out waitress sat  outside in between checking on us and the other table.. All in all good food."}
{"text":"Rude service, okay food. Bartender was so unfriendly and short with us. There were only 3 other people at the bar (and at the restaurant in total) because it was around 2 pm on Saturday but she was more interested in telling another patron about her new girlfriend not being a crack head. Seriously, exact words were \"and she's not a crackhead!\" I don't mind eclectic people and places but come on! Not at work."}
{"text":"I was skeptical.  I do tend to be a bit of a Pollyanna when it comes to bars and restaurants, but this place did exceed expectations.  I'd heard about it vaguely from a friend who did a good amount of boozing there;  apart from knowing someone who'd get lit there, the place was a mystery, but one that I didn't think all that much of.  One evening, a friend and I decided to check it out.    The decor is fitting.  Sure, there are Miller and Bud Light signs everywhere, but sometimes I think bars get too wrapped up in showing off what craft beers they have.  That being said, their beer selection is some of the best downtown, and if you hit happy hour in the evening, it's all dirt cheap.  There's a beer of the day, too.    Side note;  I think the backlit bottles behind the bar are actually pretty cool.    The service was alright.  Nothing to write home about.  They were friendly, brought me drinks, didn't hover, and were responsive.    The food bumped this up to the 4-star.  While I might just be sheltered, the chicken wings here are some of the best I've had in Cleveland.  They're not huge, but what they lack in size they pack in flavor and texture.  The skin is crisp, the meat is moist, tender, and comes off the bone with an obscenely small amount of effort.  I'm a fan of the dry rub, but the sauces are great.  I appreciate that they don't drown their wings in sauce, too.    What I expected was something totally unremarkable, desperately trendy, and disappointingly overpriced, but I ended up with a pleasant surprise.  I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"After my first post an owner p.messaged me and explained they had done some re training and now that I'm Back again for another UFC fight since the tilted kilt stopped showing them, im happy to report that it totally worked! As soon as we sat down a server came over to take our order, she's been around a million times since and the uniforms make it way easier to spot them! Thanks for listening...we'll be back !"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a cold Saturday night.  No wait, fast friendly service.  The food was good.  I had the bang bang shrimp tacos and a stout beer on recommendation.  Both were really good.  My husband had a burger and fries.  He commented on the fresh cut fries.  Very comfortable vibe."}
{"text":"My very first Yelp review ever!! I just had to compliment the bartender they have, with the baseball cap. I believe his name is Eric.(soooo not sure lol) super hard worker, really nice guy. I've been here twice late night, and he got me everything before I could even finish putting in my order. Literally pouring my shot, while getting my beer. Got my wings within 5 minutes. Pineapple habanero, I prefer very spicy food, but these were not hot at all. They were very good either way. Great overall experience, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Ridiculously long wait. Over an hour for a burger...a good 20 plus minutes for even a chance to order, and they aren't that busy. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I love sports. I love beer. I love places that I don't have to walk far to get to after work or after a baseball game. I love City Tap.  It's not perfect, but it does what it needs to do. The later you're there, obviously the more difficult it will be to navigate, and the louder it will be - if you're looking for a casual beer after work to just kick back with some coworkers, it's a great place at 5 p.m. At 10 p.m., it's a bar of sports bros taking up most of the space. Pick your battles. It's a narrow bar, making it hard to navigate. Not a great place if you're claustrophobic or hate people. I'm fine with either setting, but it's not for everyone. it's not always fun to yell to your friends sitting right next to you, but it's to be expected on a weekend night.  The beer selection is vast, which I love. It gives me the opportunity to try out something new, but I can also always fall back on my old favorites if I'm not feeling too adventurous. I've never tried their food, but friends have eaten while we're there and no one has complained about their meals, so I'll go by their silence that the food isn't bad.  The staff is decent. Normally I'm at the bar, and the bartenders are neither overly friendly nor overly rude - they're there to serve you your drinks. We were at a table last weekend, and had the most wonderful server ever - she responded to our group's weird sense of humor and, when asked to \"surprise\" members of our party with beers they might like, she made good selections every time. My friend and I liked her so much, we wanted to ask for her phone number to hang out sometime!  Problem: Bathroom is upstairs, which is not always fun to navigate. Stairs are also never a great idea if you've been here for a few hours. The bathroom is small, and I've been privy to a few way-too-personal conversations about child support and custody battles while trying to get in and out.  They have good Happy Hour deals ($1 off drafts, $3 well drinks, $5 apps), and also have a power hour M-F from 8-9, when all drafts and bottles are $2. I haven't been able to experience that for myself yet, but it's on my list."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and safe to say the food was alright but just alright. Our drinks were great and also our bill was decent. The only complaint was our server wasn't consistent. She took forever to check on us when the whole restaurant had nothing but 5 customer there including me and my company. She also took forever to come refill our waters. Probably won't come here again if I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab a beer downtown. The food is pretty good but the beer selection and prices are why I go back."}
{"text":"Ahhhh.....change IS good.  This place has went through some pretty major changes since its Forti's days and its nothing but for the better.  All taps are filled, bathrooms have been thoroughly cleaned, floors have been sanded, the entire bar has been redecorated, and its a whole new staff.  I really enjoyed my time talking with what appeared to be the wife of the owner (or co-owner).  She was very nice, my friend thought she was beautiful...ha.    As I only went in for a drink after a Monsters game, I was pleasantly surprised by the brightness in here.  I love the list of beers and their prices on the beer wall, all are reasonably priced.  I would say that this place is going to hang on especially now that RJ Bolands has sunk their ship, leaving City Tab prime pickings for those heading over to and after the game.    I did check out the menu and liked what I seen.  Problem I had with Forti's was that their kitchen was junk.  By junk I mean dirty, in every aspect, so go ahead and use your imagination.  Not any more, thank you City Tap for cleaning up that eye sore.  I did see what appeared to be fresh, local buns lined up which would be perfect with all the lovely treats on the menu.  I did see a few plates come out and all looked good.  I will definitely be back for happy hour and to try the food.  If their food is good and I get the same service as last visit, I will be jumping this up to a 4 star review.  I hate to see bad reviews for any place and I did mention this in conversation with the owner.  He stated that they just opened 1 month ago and they did have some software issues and about a 2 week 'menu adjustment' but finally getting into the swing of things.  This was really reassuring and helped me ignore the first couple reviews for City Tap, I hope you consider mine when stopping in.  I really think you should give this place a chance.  Beer I tried: Bell's Winter Ale.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Freshly styled inside, great easy going atmosphere. Lighted bottles behind the bar are def a nice touch and conversation piece. Beer selection is awesome and their sampler pack thing is a great idea if you hadn't tried a beer before and are afraid to order and be stuck paying the full price for something you hate. It's refreshing to see a place like this downtown."}
{"text":"Best beer selection downtown. Their power hour is one of the best deals you'll find - $3 for any draft usually under $7. Wish it was longer than an hour though! Their bar tenders are fast and knowledgeable.   Underrated part of city tap is the food. Great sandwiches, amazing pretzel bites, and fantastic wings. I'm a regular here for a reason!"}
{"text":"This place is as yelp says it \"as good as it gets\" for a sports bar.  I love going to City Tap before Indians, cavs games, or before concerts at the Q because of its super close proximity to everything. Their happy hour is pretty great! From 3 to 7 pm you can get 1 dollar off all drafts, 3 dollar well drinks and 5 dollar appetizers! I always seem to end up getting one because they are so delicious and such a good deal. I really like the pretzel sticks because they are served with a seriously yummy cinnamon butter. The chicken quesadilla is also a favorite.  If you can't get there by happy hour, stop in Monday through Friday from 8 to 9 for power hour! The deal is two dollars drafts!! The power hour specials and happy hour specials only apply to drafts under six dollars.  The wall behind the bar has their extensive list of beer on draft including prices and alcohol percentage. They have a seriously huge beer selection and it could take awhile to get through them all. This place is a favorite of mine and I will continue to return"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the heart of CLE. Great happy hour specials and a weekly power hour Friday's @ 8. They also have some of the best bar food you will find downtown. Inexpensive and always hits the spot on game days!"}
{"text":"Go here. Do it. Great fries, burgers, and beer. Vast beer selection. Again, come here."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. I like to come here before and/or after games at Progressive Field and the Q. We also got a snack (buffalo chicken dip) which was good. Not too spicy but still flavorful and chips not too salty. Happy hour specials help too."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to live in Ohio city, and ate city tap wraps on a monthly basis. Their southwest chicken wrap was by far our favorite. Since we moved to the burbs we had been craving it for a long time. I wanted to surprise him and picked up a to go order of the southwest and buffalo chicken wraps while I was downtown. Both wraps were very small and the buffalo wrap was smothered in buffalo with barely any chicken and barely any veggies... Might as well call it a buffalo sauce wrap. And the southwest wrap was all lettuce with barely any southwest dressing or chicken. It was so disappointing. I still love the atmosphere at city tap... the drinks, location and decor, staff was good... but they are cutting corners on quality and quantity with their food and it shows..."}
{"text":"This place is an absolutel disgrace. Came from St. Louis, MO to see my first NBA basketball as a fan of Lebron since he entered the league. Decided to try this place as it was nearby the stadium. The bartender (didn't catch her name but she looked like a mix between Pink and Avril Lavine) was incredibly rude. She asked for my ID and after examining for less than 5 seconds, proceeded to tell me it was fake. Keep in mind that I have a Missouri ID and I am 26 years old. Rather than asking me for a second form or trying to handle the situation like a professional, she proceeded to completely bend my ID in half claiming that it was fake. I presented her with 7 forms of identification. 4 credit cards, my ID, my fishing license with my birthday on it and my University of Missouri Student ID with my picture on it. She proceeded to laugh in my face and tell me it all wasn't real (while continuing to bend my ID in half). Only when I told her I had to fly back to St. Louis today and NEEDED my ID did she realize this wasn't a big joke. I also threatened to have the cops come to get her to hand me my ID as she continued to hold it hostage. After much back and forth, she finally handed me my ID back, looked me in the eyes and said \"We don't need/want your business anyways.\"   My jaw about dropped to the floor. Not only was I ridiculed and embarrassed for trying to give the establishment business, but I was also told that they didn't even want my business. Seems like a very \"consumer friendly\" place. I will be calling the manager at 11am sharp today to politely request that he gives me the funds for a new ID. I feel as if it is the least they can do.   I will attempt to attach the ID picture for those that like visual evidence..."}
{"text":"If you are a beer drinker - then you have to love this place.  Tons of beer on tap ranging in style and tastes.  Do the power hour from 8-9pm for very cheap drafts. Kinda wired on the food service though - no table service for drinks or food during power hour."}
{"text":"Eric is the best!!!! He listens to what his customers like and makes the perfect drink for whatever you are in the mood for. Great service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to grab or drink or food before or after a game or maybe even a workout (proud of you if you can pull that off to my fellow athletes)? Or, hey, maybe a friend wants to go out for happy hour, which they have, and you need a cool spot to go to. Well, come on down to City Tap!  With a diverse beer menu, and full bar, you can find anything your heart desires on this menu. I personally love coming her during the summer because you can sit outside on the patio; even though it is not big, it is better than nothing. In addition to this, the typical \"bar food\" you see at other places is here, but they take more time and pride in how the food is served, than their local competitors.   Luckily, there is street parking and a lot for you to park your car at. If you are lucky enough to walk, do this. If you park on East 4, buy a drink there and then get your ticket validated, you will only have to pay 8 dollars. After that first drink, then come here because they prices are much cheaper than East 4."}
{"text":"Spent a few hours here on a Friday night with a group of friends. The music isn't loud enough, you can hear it just enough to figure out which song is playing. The bartender didn't seem to care much about service, one of my friends waited 10, 15 minutes at the bar to try to buy a drink (standing with her card out) and other people were getting served within a minute or two. We got the chicken tenders to share, which were good, but not worth the price, especially because it didn't even come with fries."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on business and the valet pointed this place out. In a town that rolls up the sidewalks after 9:00, it was nice that I could not only get a great beer selection, but some decent eats as well.  The bar is very narrow and I'm sure it's tough to get around if crowded. I had no problems with service. As much as the bartenders had to deal with some of the meatball crowd, they were cool and had good suggestions on beers to try.  In any case, great place if you want a late night beer or grub. My impression is that it could get a bit out of hand, so I would avoid when the local teams are playing at home."}
{"text":"Pre and Post Cavs games have been my only trips to City Tap.    Very busy, but with good table service.  Many choices on the menu for food, and you kind of have to get something because the kitchen aisle is the same as the table aisle and bar aisle.  Free smells all night long.    Interesting layout, but they do what they can.  Upstairs is kind of a cool area for people watching and smelling the bathrooms.  Chances you will knock into someone spilling all of their drinks: 85%"}
{"text":"I live downtown and this joint is just a great place to hang out with friends and watch any sport game. Bar Started in bowling green ohio(shout out to bgsu)   But tricks of the trade from a local:  Monday - Friday 8pm to 9pm power hour! 2 dollar beers for any tap expect the crazy expensive ones (6-7 dollar) Great deal I recommend it.   It's called city tap... get a beer!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ate here or been in this establishment and I'm very impressed with the service ,food and the atmosphere! I had a server named Lindsey very nice lady she quickly pointed out the Cleveland crunch burger when I asked her which one to choose it was very tasty they season their meat and it wasn't blan tasting. I was on break for work so I couldn't indulge in the Mecca of beers this place has holy moly ! I recommend very much the price was very reasonable. I also ordered the honey Siracha wings excellent and they don't charge you for celery and ranch ! Kudos City Tap I will be back to try some beers!"}
{"text":"I was in town for the NCAA Wrestling Tournament last weekend and stopped into City Tap to meet up with a few of my New York friends who had been here the night before. Had a pretty good time and got pretty quick service for as busy as they were.  They had a good crowd so it took ten minutes or so to get in but I got a drink in less than five minutes so I had no complaints. Though I didn't eat here they have a kitchen and offer a nice selection of your typical bar foods at pretty decent prices. I was impressed by their selection of beers on tap and in the bottle and I don't think they are going to run out of liquor anytime soon.  I come up for five or six Indians games and a couple Browns games every year and I will most definitely be back this summer. The service was fast, friendly, and efficient; the prices were fair; and the place had a really good vibe or atmosphere. I would have no problem recommending this place to anyone working downtown, attending a game or event at the Q, or catching a game at the Jake.   (yes I know I am suppose to be Progressive, but it will always be Jacobs Field to me.)"}
{"text":"Detroiter here stopped in before Indians/Tigers game. Belly up to the bar. Friendly patrons even though I am the enemy. Bartender attentive and kind and smiling (cute too). A smile goes a long way. I picked the right place! Go Tigers."}
{"text":"Woah...I walked in on the Power Hour 8pm-9pm(Mon-Fri) $2 on almost all drafts and bottles. Plus their beer list is cramazing! Currently I am having a local brew from Platform, Speed Merchant. Undoubtedly AWESOME!. Now only if this bar is in Milwaukee. :-("}
{"text":"Draft beer list is great and food is good. The service is terrible. We have walked out multiple times because we couldn't get service. We even got ignored when we politely tried to ask for service.   Grab a beer - don't stay."}
{"text":"This place is HOME to me. I absolutely love the staff, the food is good and the patrons aren't too bad either. In all honesty, I come here to see Brandi and sometimes Eric. No matter, I will choose this place over some E4th bar any day."}
{"text":"Such a fun bar! They have an amazing power hour Monday through Friday 7-8 which is $2 all drafts!! The food is good for bar food and their pretzel sticks are my favorite. Definitely a good spot to hangout before or after Cleveland sports games when you are downtown!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Great bar food. If you're down to share, I highly recommend the loaded tots and the loaded nachos. Also their wings are very very yummy! Juicy and crispy that the same time. My fav flavors are honey sriracha and garlic parmesan. Also highly recommend the southwestern chicken wrap!!!"}
{"text":"It was daylight savings time night and we had maybe about a half hour to find a bar to let us in and hopefully extend our night of fun. We ended up coming here not knowing what to expect but not really caring either.   Place has a narrow bar area with a cool little food kitchen Im assuming that serves pizza? I couldnt really tell but it was close to the bar and smelt great.  The bar walls are decorated in empty alcohol bottles that reach near the ceiling, lit up with florescent lights, it was pretty impressive to the drunk eye.   We headed upstairs after collecting like 10 beers. Upstairs has a nice view of the bar below and all the lit bottles on the walls as well as more flat screens playing sports, and theres a pool table. We shot half a game of pool and heard that last call was being shouted out, so we wrapped things up as quickly as possible and headed out.   Clean place, decorated really cool. Would return"}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Would have eaten if offered a menu and more than one beer but bartender was too busy talking to coworkers and texting to even care. I love beer but it doesn't matter how many beers you have on tap if no one is there to ask if you want another.  I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This place was cursed.  Nothing stuck.  It was always dead.  Then there came the City Tap.  Sure, it's not exactly busy all the time - but check it out after a Cav's or Indian's game and you're guaranteed to run into someone you know.  Overall - I really like this bar!    They have a $3 beer of the day which is always a step-above and everything that I've ever ordered from the menu was exactly what I was looking for (c'mo...it's bar food...but hey - it's not bad!) and well priced.  If they installed more TV's, I'd be there even more!"}
{"text":"Best Fried Pickles in Town!  And a great menu, with tons of choices. The reuben was pretty good, and on marble rye. Nice touch.   The best time to enjoy City Tap is weekday and on Mondays.  It's their $3 craft beer night.  And they have a great selection. Also, they have a \"Power Hour\", when draft beers are discounted down.     Casual atmosphere with a good mixed crowd. And I'm sure it is packed to the gills when the Tribe plays.  But if you want a good bite, and cheap beer on a Monday, check it out."}
{"text":"We stopped for a couple of pregame beverages before the White Sox Indians game. It was a good choice. The mini corn dogs and mozzarella sticks were really good and cheap and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Went here after an Indians game and I am so glad that I did.  I have just two words to say about this place... shrimp tacos.  3 good sized tacos with a side for $7?  I was expecting small corn tortillas with minature shrimp to be honest... but no they were flour tortillas with 2 large shrimp per taco.  Also, the spicy and sweet combination with the sauce was really just perfect.  As long as these are on the menu, I will keep coming back.  The tap selection is quite good, which you would expect from a place named City Tap.  They also have some pretty insane happy hour deals like the $2 power hour.  The recommended berry weiss mixed with the summer shandy to make a strawberry lemonade tasting beer was right on.  City Tap might just be my new go to place for a downtown drinking establishment."}
