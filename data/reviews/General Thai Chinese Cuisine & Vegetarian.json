{"text":"Vegetarians rejoice! General Thai Chinese and vegetarian food has only been open for a few weeks but is exactly what Aurora needed. The vegetarian food is fantastic without the need to drive out of the city, and so tasty that my meat eating partner even requests take out from here. She stopped ordering the meat dishes because the veggie ones are better.  Seventy percent if the menu is non vegetarian which is odd because there is a lot of competition in this field and the chef told me he comes from 14 years in a vegetarian kitchen and it shows in his amazing cooking.  Recommendations:   Tofu and veggie beef soup Cedar veggie beef fried rice Crispy veggie chicken Veggie steak and potatoes with black pepper sauce  One of the best places to eat in Aurora and currently 10 percent off for the grand opening."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good, definitely coming back.  I'm vegetarian so I'm always excited when I get to order \"meat dishes\". According to my non-vegetarian boyfriend, he didn't miss the meat at all.  We ordered: Veggie chicken with sweet and sour sauce Eggplant with veggie beef in garlic sauce Veggie pork ketchup fried rice Mini spring rolls  This is the type of food where you keep eating not because you're hungry, but because it tastes so good.  Highly recommend the first 3 items, but the mini spring rolls were pretty meh. I thought it would be a mini vegetable filled spring rolls but it was crispy pumpkin floss? I think?  It wasn't what I was expecting so maybe it's just me.    Will definitely order here again. Very friendly owners too!"}
{"text":"We tried out this place accidentally because the takeout place we wanted to order from was closed that day. So very glad that we did. This place is easy to miss, as it's only a order counter, but it's the best Chinese take out that we've had in the area. We ordered the General Tao Chicken, the House special fried rice, the Cantonese Chow Mein and the beef with broccoli. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I don't know what they're doing but this place is producing some of the best fusion thai/chinese/western dishes in the area!  Definite go-to for ordering Thai/Chinese.  Let me take it a step back and clarify fusion - I'm not saying they're going all food network challenge, and producing any insane combinations, but the food they serve isn't perfectly in the realm of classic either.  The Pad Thai is better than any place I've tried outside of Toronto core, but it's not a perfect Pad Thai, it feels like a chinese noodle cook's version of Pad Thai - and whether that's a Thai cook trained in Chinese style or a Chinese cook trained in Thai; it works!  The green curry, another great example; tastes like a good Thai green curry, served with a vegetable selection that reminds me of Chinese yellow curry - not so much that it's just a sauce swap, but enough for you to notice.  Overall this is my favourite take-out place in Newmarket/Aurora."}
{"text":"They have replaced the four Seasons  restaurant. The prices are somewhat higher and the result is not  up to standard. I have had better and I've had worse. I will look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here & was pleasantly surprised :) this Place was great! Reasonably priced and came much quicker then they said it would"}
{"text":"Staff are very very friendly, and welcoming. So when I entered immediately it felt like a great first experience.  It's very small inside, only room for about 5 people to eat. But they mostly cater to delivery and take away.  Shrimp Wonton soup was good, broth was flavourful and the wontons were good. Not the best shrimp wontons I've ever had, but they were still pretty tasty.  The fried rice was awesome, lots of flavour and not dry. I hate when they serve fried rice and it's dry, but here it was probably the best fried rice I've had in a while.  The General Tso's chicken was delicious! Not too battered, lots of chicken and the right amount of spice.  I have to say the reason for the 3 stars are for the following reasons. The spring roll was so oily, I had to use two thick napkins to soak up the oil. They didn't let the spring roll sit and allow excess oil to drip off so it was too oily. But after getting most of the oil off it was good! The chicken pad sew was so disappointing. It didn't taste like pad sew at all. It just tasted like chowmein with all the pad sew ingredients. It seemed pretty clear they don't know what sauces are used for pad sew. It's one of my fave thai dishes and I just couldn't eat it.   Overall, I probably won't try the pad sew again, but I will go back to try other foods. Their Chinese foods seem to be pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Awesome food as compare to other Resteurent in Newmarket and  aurora.Quality and quantity of food is gr8...Soup ,Special fried rice etc Must try."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!  The vegetarian is excellent as is the non-vegetarian. I had difficulty keeping my meat eaters away from my bounty of scrumptious veg food. The meat eaters loved theirs too.  A wonderful spot for all.  Thank you General Thai in Aurora - we are a happy blended family tonight. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This the best available in Aurora and surrounding area. Varied menu offering vegetarian, Thai, and other choices. Food is high quality. Can't go wrong Only downside not enough room to set up indoor dining."}
{"text":"First time here and pleasantly surprised! The next time I have a hankering for Chinese takeout, i'll go back for sure. We picked up two of the combo dinners, general tao and beef with black pepper - plenty of meat, not filled with the cheap veggies (celery, onions, green peppers and carrots that so many places like to fill their \"meat\" dishes with). The sauces were flavourful, but NOT salty (i find everything's salty) and it wasn't greasy. YAY!!  Even the person who took our order was super polite.I wish i knew about this place before!"}
{"text":"It's alright. The owners are really nice.   The food is okay, its not bad but at the same time I've had better.   Still, their prices are reasonable and the food is decent, so if you're rushed for time it's an okay place to go."}
