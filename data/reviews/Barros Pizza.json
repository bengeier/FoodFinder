{"text":"I stopped into this location for a quick lunch today.  Restaurant was pretty busy.    Upon arriving at 12:35 Pm the tables that were not taken with people sitting at them had dirty dishes on them.  After I ordered and went to sit down I asked the cashier if she could wipe the table, she didn't come over so I just put the dirty dish from the table on the counter next to the register.  I had a salad bar salad and piece of pizza.  By the time I was finished lunch at 12:55 NONE of the tables had been bussed or cleaned and my plate was still sitting by the register untouched.  I was very disappointed in the atmosphere not being clean and only can think about if your dining area is that dirty how dirty is your kitchen?"}
{"text":"This is a GOOD neighborhood pizza joint. When I'm in a \"Pizza Hut\" (but better) mood this is where I come for a hearty pizza, nothing fancy like Oregano's or Grimaldi's, but amongst the best local \"regular\" pizza in town. I really like their traditional/regular crust. I think it has a unique flavor. I also enjoy their thin crust, which still gives you the satisfaction of eating a real pizza...Not so thin you feel you're eating an overgrown potato chip with cheese and sauce on top. Our favorite is the Barro's Special. Replace the green peppers with the jalapeños if you like heat. The place is also very kid friendly. Their cheese pizza is a staple at toddler birthday parties. Their decor is very informal, but comfortable. Not so fancy you feel guilty when your kids spill. The staff is mostly part time high schoolers wearing the Barro's uniform. They are friendly and mean well, though they make the occasional high schoolish mistake, which management is quick to fix. Pricing is very reasonable and they have great specials such as 2 larges, 1topping each for $19.99. We've picked up or dined in more times than I can count and we will continue to do so."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting AZ & from last time I was here, I have been craving Barros. Finally got some last night & it was as bomb as EVER. I just love that they're not stingy with the toppings & the pricing is not bad for it. The only thing that could make it better would be if it was available in my city (Las Vegas)"}
{"text":"This Barros sucks! Been there 3 times and every time the pizza was soggy and the wings were gamey or raw. Hence everything you get there is undercooked unless it's the Meatball sub which comes out over cooked and dry."}
{"text":"I was visiting some family in Scottsdale and we stopped in here for lunch...gotta say - solid pizza! Got the thin crust with salami and mushrooms. Great price and the crust was nice and crunchy fresh out of the oven. Good tasting sauce and the sauce to cheese ratio was spot on for me. Beer selection is a little lacking if you're into craft beer, but hopefully they'll bring in some local stuff on tap. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I have never dined in   This is one of my go to.  Food to go places.    Great pizza. And they know how to cook a pizza. Great sauce.   And the best thing about barros... very reasonable prices on pizza and sandwiches"}
{"text":"First time eating their pizza....excellent Meat also the Hawaiian. It was all good down to the crust it was like a soft bread. Right around the back door corner of the Barrett Jackson auction. Glad we tried it will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place and how extremely careful they are with allergens. My daughter has a glutten, dairy, and cheese allergy and this place has been so helpful making sure our order is done right every time. Every time I order from them they prompt.  Also, when ordering the delivery is timely. Thank goodness for them and their team!"}
{"text":"Late by 15 minutes or more every single time... An hour plus for pizza up the street... No apology (update:  we were given the wrong time apparently. They credited us a free pizza. Thank you)"}
{"text":"Ryssa u r wonderful!!!! Thank u for your Customer Service  u have always takin great care of our family. I Love Barros best sit down pizza around!! Just an update to my earlier post this Barros is still wonderful the Manager Ryssa is the best customer service manager ever thank u Ryssa for always takin care of my family!!"}
{"text":"Had a thin crust mixed meat topping opening night.  Topping was great; however the bottom crust was like a piece paper had been soaking in water.  Impossible to to pickup the pieces. Had to use a fork.  Hopefully they figure out the soggy crust issue."}
{"text":"First time ordering from this location - Online order showed up 25 minutes before websites predicted time.  Delivery guy was friendly, and order was perfect - exactly as placed, and hot!"}
{"text":"Came in at 3:30 for the lunch special that ends at 4. I asked for multiple slices of pepperoni and was told they weren't going to make any more (no other Barros would do that so early). Multiple customers came in afterwards looking for cheese which they were also out of and they offered to make them. The pizza I was given had clearly been sitting for a while and it seemed like they were trying to get rid of those slices. Rather odd service for a chain of restaurants that does so well with lunch slices."}
{"text":"Barros on 24th St and Baseline is the worst! I cannot express how disappointing it is EVERY SINGLE TIME we get our orders. 95 percent of the time our orders are wrong. I ask for very basic mods on the orders... don't add mustard on a sandwich or don't add peppers on a salad... and for some reason the employees at this location cannot get it correct. Do they not know how to read an order ticket? How does this happen so often???And not to mention 9 times out of 10 they don't remember to bring something. They will forget to bring our sauces or soda or something. It never fails. It is already frustrating enough to typically wait an hour to receive our orders. Then on top of it all I have to call back in and wait even longer for them to bring our correct order. PLEASE PLEASE train your staff. If Dominos can get it right.... then so can you."}
{"text":"First time coming to this new location and I ordered 12 wings, and when I picked up my order came home and everything was wrong. They gave my honey hot and I asked for \"hot\" with extra hot sauce on the wings"}
{"text":"My first time at this one and it was nice. :) $21 for a large half n half pizza, cheese garlic bread, and 3 drinks, not bad at all. :) They have a nice kid section for the little ones and the seating was clean and not cramped. Overall service was nice and it wasn't noisy. Just a neutral atmosphere with yummy food. :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this barros for a few weeks now. They have a very affordable lunch special with a different pizza of the day. I have had nothing but a good experience when I dine in or take out. I would highly recommend barros to anyone looking for an affordable lunch."}
{"text":"On this visit it wasn't too busy and received quick service for lunch. I had a 2 slice lunch and drink special. Food was at a decent temp and very tasty (as always). What I didn't care for was that the employee taking orders, handling cash and cleaning up tables that weren't cleared from the lunch rush was serving food without washing her hands in between actions."}
{"text":"I've always ordered NYPD Pizza, but their prices are getting high. Tried Barro's and love their pizza...you get alot for your money, and they offer XL size pizza.  Tastes great!!"}
{"text":"Don't call what you have delivery. It's not. At best, it's like curbside pickup. Smh"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this Barros but today Kaitlyn was extremely rude my husband called to order a pizza and when she asked for his number she said he was (mumbling) being in customer service that is not the way you talk to customers! You ask them sir I can't hear you may you repeat that. Point blank she obviously needs more training on how to be polite... or find a different job if you're not happy!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, flavorful and filling.  Wings are ok.  More expensive than a Domino's Pizza but worth paying a little extra once in a while. Order is always ready when I come pick it up."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a slice for lunch under $5 for slice salad and soda. I dined in on Saturday afternoon and the first thing I noticed was how nice the staff were. Every person working this day smiled and double checked we had everything we needed. Dining is relaxed with no frills but the staff were constantly keeping busy and cleaning counters. Nice to have Barros in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Our pizza was delicious! Our service great even though we arrived close to closing time. The waitress made us feel welcome. Thank you! Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"They came through with my request glad to have Barros in the neighborhood great staff"}
{"text":"This location seems to have gotten it's act together after some speed bumps associated with their grand opening. The wife and I have dined in several times with no issues (and great service)."}
{"text":"Not too many pizza options with delivery in the area.  Tried this chain not expecting much.  Got the order partially wrong.  Wasn't anything special, and really no different than Dominoes or Pizza Hut.  Not much sauce.  Wouldn't eat here again and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the closest Barro's to me. I have celiac disease and order the gluten-free pizza every time. More than once, there was no parchment paper under my pizza, so the pizza touched the oven where gluten pizzas are made. Don't claim to be gluten-free if you're not going to attempt to prevent cross-contamination. If it touches a normal oven, people with celiac will have a reaction. This isn't a fad diet, Barro's - you're being negligent when it comes to allergies. I'm not giving them 1 star because of the fact that I *do* appreciate them offering GF pizza at all.   I also ordered delivery tonight, and ordered a 2 liter of soda with my pizza. They brought a warm 2 liter. What's the point?"}
{"text":"We go to Phoenix for a hockey tournament every year and we always get pizza from this place at least once during our stay.  Sometimes we dine in and other times it's to go.  Great pizza's and salads and would recommend this place.    This year we catered from them for a Team Dinner and they had the food delivered to our location right on time and the food was all hot.  Pizza, appetizers, pasta dishes, etc.   Thanks."}
{"text":"I am disappointed Barros does not have a direct contact link on their website. Last night I ordered pizza for takeout  from this new location. Unfortunately, I ordered a well-done pie, and the crust was soft and limp. This new staff needs to learn how to do it right, because everything else was good."}
{"text":"Ordered on line, everything went very smooth using the Barro's app. The medium pizza on original crust was hot and delicious, very generous with the toppings and the driver got to our house in 30 minutes. Highly recommend Barro's Pizza, very satisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered take out $56 for 3 pizzas and 12 wings. Pizzas were good but they gave us one spoon full of sauce on the wings. Always check your orders before leaving."}
{"text":"I see that a healthy percentile of yelp users are avidly posting negative reviews on establishments that have served and nourished me very well. This Barros has been nothing less than excellent on several occasions from dining in to picking up. Don't let the pessimists discourage you on your choice to give this place a go.   Cheers :)"}
{"text":"Here's the thing, I like Barro's Pizza. The one in Cave Creek was awesome. We use this one to order for our employees, so I order from this place alot, and this has to be the worst Barro's there is. I literally have to spell the order out for them every time. \"Make sure the pizza is cooked throughout.\"  Because I have gotten undercooked pizza at least 3 times from this place.  Then there was the day they were \"short staffed\". It took nearly 30 minutes to place the order. Then when they said it would take 1hour, it took 2hrs.   Today was the final straw. Hot Wing Pizza from every other Barros includes Ranch, these guys seem to always forget that EACH time. So today, I asked to make sure they don't forget it. \"Um Sir, that's extra.\"What! Wow. So they literally had to get \"manager's approval\" to give me a ranch for a hot wing pizza, where it should be included."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here, we were not very hungry so we just ordered an order of cheese ravioli and chose to add meatballs to the order.  It took 25 minutes to get our order, which was ok but we saw a few other people come in after us with much larger orders and they received their food pretty fast compared to the time we waited.  When our food arrived it was worth the wait. The ravioli was very tasty and my wife really enjoyed the meatballs.  The order also came with garlic bread which was very good. Overall the portion was perfect size for two people who were not starving, but just wanted to have a light dinner."}
{"text":"I am a long time fan of Barros pizza. In my opinion they have the best pizza in Arizona. If you want a mom and pop shop that's got great pizza Barros is it. I love this new location too!"}
{"text":"We are always looking for less expensive places in Scottsdale to eat with our kids and Barros delivered! (Not literally... We ate in the restaurant :)) We had lunch specials; Kids eating pizza and us having the salad bar.  The kids loved the pizza and other than the lettuce being a bit brown (hence the lack of 5 stars) the salad bar was small, but had everything we were looking for.  Not to mention it was very clean and nicely decorated. Great portions and a great price!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite because I was working this weekend.  The food seem to take a while to make it to my table.  I just ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  The food was good and the garlic break was tasty.  I like it and will be back."}
{"text":"Please clean this place up. This location recently opened and it is filthy. Wings, veggies, pizza, straws, and trash on the floor. Has the health dept. visited this place? I doubt it but somebody should inspect it for cleanliness. I'm not eating this pizza because I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"Called in my order. Was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived 15-20 minutes later. And then waited another 20 minutes. Pizza was ready 38 minutes after I placed my call. But hey the pizza was good."}
{"text":"I've always had great service here. And if something is wrong they correct it right away. I have read threw a lot of review of bad experiences and I am sorry for that. When it was new they were trying to gain there feet. Now it's better then before. But one review said something about there Caesar salad not being great. They DON'T have Caesar salad. But I have posted several photos of my food and it's nothing less then amazing. Great job guys. Keep it up"}
{"text":"I really loved coming here but tonight put me off! I love the fact that they're open late as I work late.  Ordered my usual honey hot wings to be told they're out of honey hot sauce, ok no problem. Proceeded to order mozzarella stix, and the garden salad with Italian dressing.  Go to pick up my order and they're  out of marinara sauce??? Ummm hello what are you going to put on the rest of your pizzas for the night? Ok the kicker is I get home and they didn't even give me my salad dressing! This isn't the first time this has happened and it's super frustrating to get home and have things wrong! Just be aware they mess up orders frequently. Don't think I'll be back which is a shame Bc I enjoyed them."}
{"text":"This last Sunday, I made order close to $100 worth of food order pizza and wings. Which they are limited to the ranch they provide. But this time I was so upset as soon as I got home and saw onlu two dam ugly celery sticks? Really?? I think they even should even put those in my food. Really good pizza put was disappointed on them"}
{"text":"This location seemed a bit crowded and unprepared for the arrival of human beings to eat pizza. There were several of us staring at our receipts and waiting for our pies long after we were told to pick up the pizza. One huge order never got plugged in due to computer issues and that may have slowed everything else down. I only had to wait five extra minutes, but the pies (two for $22) did not have the same taste as other Barro's locations. The teens at the counter were chewing gum, but generally good customer service up front, but the back of the house had issues that day and it appears on many other days as well. See you again in about four months after you work out those famous opening \"kinks\""}
{"text":"Good stuff, Man! We always get The Barros Special, which is a really great pie. Antipasta salad is always fresh and good, and the sides (cheese bread, mozzarella sticks, etc.) are always pretty delish. Delivery is consistent and punctual."}
{"text":"The pizza from here seems to taste better than the other Barros restaurants. Staff is nice, plenty of TVs to watch a game. We enjoy eating here"}
{"text":"The location is close to our house. Tried the pizza and its sooo freaking good. Better than other places. So if you looking do a really yum pizza spot try this place. I'm a pizza guy so I recommend the pepperoni pizza with think crust."}
{"text":"Maybe it was because it was noon on Saturday and they hadn't quite sold all the pizza slices from the night before. I had two slices of pizza that were definitely stale and tough to chew. Next time I'll ask if the slices I want are fresh. Normally the food is fresh and fantastic. This time not so much."}
{"text":"So update, Had a credit of an xl pizza called in a pick up it was around 3:30pm  asked if I could change to a large guy said no problem but charged for the extra topping ? I ordered ham snd pineapple im like ok and crispy wings. Good service waited at the counter a bit maybe because it was empty  Got home the pizza was awlful it was so heavy like they put 3x the cheese snd the wings well they needed a life jacket from all the sauce and were not crispy. I gave the pizza away and threw the wings out. Shame I really enjoyed the pizza before they are never consistent anymore will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place needs to learn a bunch feom the other Barros. I called an order on for pickup and i had to repeat my order multiple times because she was to paying attention to the order.    There are three girls working the front counter and they have a real hard time answering the phone and helping customers.  Every time i have been here their ice tea was out.  This is a great example of why minimum wage does not need to be raised."}
{"text":"I would usually give more stars as I pick up frequently and always have good results. However I had a pizza delivered last Friday, it was a serious disappointment. I paid almost 30.00 for a large pizza fees and tip included. The pizza was destroyed. All the toppings had cascaded to one side, the cheese was fused to the box. It was soaking wet so the crust was wet and falling apart. I tried to salvage it by putting it in the over, but it just fell apart in a big slop, individual pieces barely discernible. I ended up with a pizza casserole wetness that was barely edible. The dogs loved it. Will NEVER order delivery again."}
{"text":"Food is Good but for delivery or even pick up that always get my order wrong frustrated !!"}
{"text":"Love this place for take out!  The staff is always friendly and helpful, even at the busiest of hours.  Their prices are really great - we recently ordered a large specialty pizza, extra large one topping, and large salad which came to just over $30.    When dining in at this location, it is nice that they offer beers, but it's definitely not the type of place that I'd go and sit for a few hours on game day or bring a large group in."}
{"text":"Just opened and still rough around the edges so I will give 4 stars despite needed some major work on service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"Good pizza and staff are friendly! Ordered the mega meat which was delicious and really hot when I picked it up. All and all a good pizza. I have never sat inside of the restaurant so I can't comment on the service inside but the staff looked like they were working hard to meet people's needs."}
{"text":"Was in town great pizza, I could see from the pics that the pizza was a little too saucy for my liking so I ordered with light sauce- so cheesy and yummy bread! Girls at the front were all really nice and sweet!"}
{"text":"Barros is the new kid on the block.   Clearly there's no shortage of pizza places in our area, including one just 100 feet across the parking lot. LOL  But we came away last night wondering how the old Redendo/NY 51 would fair in this location.  The setup for Barros is a large expansive warehouse type space, where you order at a cashier as you come in. Just next to the cashier is a small iceberg lettuce salad bar, where you can make your own.   After paying, they hand you a drink cup, salad bowls, and number for your table. Off to side there's a 50\" flat screen and several booths along the wall with maybe a dozen or so tables for seating.   We ordered two salads for $3.49 each, along with two drinks ($1.50) and a large 14\" pizza (half cheese and half sausage/pepperoni) for a great price of $11.01. Hands down, probably the best price for a pie west of the parking lot and Rustic.  We had high hopes for Barros Pizza, but.... our pie came covered in oil, see photo. It took nearly three napkins to get it all. At home, I'll drizzle a little on top for flavor, but here they went all out.   As I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of choices for your pizza dollars nearby. Spinato's further down FLW; Corleone's, Ray's, NYPD or Fired Pie on Northsight, even Rustic across the parking; all make better, yet very different pies.  Btw, what's with all the servers coming over one by one and asking \"how was our meal?\" It's a nice touch, but somewhat over the top and disingenuous after the seventh one. I believe the only one who missed us was the guy making the pies. LOL  There's a great deal of potential here. Our bill came in at $21.49 before taxes. We came away feeling that Barros was a decent sit down place for an inexpensive meal, but left wanting more.   So two and a half Stars, rounded up to three."}
{"text":"Customer service is ok. The food is just really bad. If you are from the tri- state area, eating this pizza is like eating salted cardboard. The McDonald's equivalent of pizza. Just horrible. Nothing Italian about this. Fast food quality, bland dough, salty sauce and chewy cheap cheese. Even the wings were gross."}
{"text":"Just ordered this and the delivery person dropped the ball!  All of the pizza was smushed and cheese was all over the top of the box! This is not ok!  A few months ago I ordered some delivery and I asked for some wings bone in and they gave me boneless.  I may not be going back here.  The pizza is great though, that is if the cheese doesn't all get stuck to the box!"}
{"text":"I dined in and the pizza arrived in a timely fashion, the girls were polite and there were no issues. The pizza is just average though. I got the thin crust which is still a hand tossed dough and not thin and crispy as I usually expect thin to be. Pizza is definitely a preference thing depending on where you grew up so if you're from IL this is probably not the place for you.  Edit: bumping it up a star as it turns out if you reheat it in the oven with a non-stick spray on the pan it actually makes the crust much crispier."}
{"text":"Sorry  Barro's, the tomato in our antipasto salad still had a label on it, good thing I looked before I ate! Do you wash your raw salad fixins before you use them?   Pizza was cold to the point where cheese was set. I live less than half a mile from you, step up your plates if you want to stay in business."}
{"text":"Soggy pizza soggy wings....again. One hour delivery time in the middle of the afternoon on a Monday. Time to move on from this place."}
{"text":"We ordered then they came out and told me that they had no spaghetti and offered Penne. Then a guy came out and said they had no Penne either. I ended up with a small very greasy Pepperoni Pizza. The salad consisted of lettuce and tomato and a sprinkle of cheese no carrots , no cukes , no onions nothing. My wife's Cheese Ravioli was obviously frozen and not even hot . The So called Marinara sauce looked like it came from a jar.But at least that was warm. She was nearly done when they brought out her Garlic bread which was likeable. I would never eat here again or recommend anyone else to. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Very juvenile acting staff. At least they were having a good time."}
{"text":"We have had 5 star experiences and 3 star experiences, thus I am giving them 4 stars. We love coming to this great family friendly restaurant. The best part is the kid's play area. My husband and I love sitting back there, enjoying conversation, and letting our toddler play with their play kitchen, legos, and watch Disney Junior. It is just perfect. To top it all of they have delicious pizza, decent wings, and great prices on their pitchers of beer (with some great local options!). Their prices are great and you just cannot beat the play area. If you want to go somewhere where everyone in the family will enjoy it, I highly recommend Barro's. I just hope you go on a day when the staff is on it. The main issue we have (when it is a 3 star visit) is the inability to ever understand how to apply their own coupons and not say anything about it. The only reason you know is because when you look at your receipt later, it is not applied! At least ask a manager how to do it or something. The staff is also not very helpful, they take your order and deliver your food to your table and that is literally it."}
{"text":"I couldn't tell you if this is \"authentic\" Chicago style pizza, but it is damn good pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered 5 pizzas and an order of 24 wings for delivery for a party. We were told it would be 40-45 minutes. Well...an hour and fifteen minutes later my wife called and was told that they had gotten busy unexpectedly and that they were working on it. On the second call they assured us that it was on its way.   About an hour and forty minutes after we ordered  lukewarm pizzas and ice cold wings finally arrived - yes, not just room temperature wings that had been sitting too long but wings that were so cold that they had to still be refrigerated.  The wings were fully cooked, just ice cold. So, do they serve frozen fully cooked wings instead of making them fresh? That would certainly appear to be the case based on what was delivered to us.   When my wife called a third time to tell them that the wings were still ice cold they offered a store credit for the price if the wings.  Like we are going to go back there again after this experience.  If I want frozen wings I can buy them from the freezer section and cook them myself.   This was probably the most incompetent pizza order I have experienced.  To be fair, my wife and son had eaten there in-store once previously and their experience wasn't as lousy as this one. But to have a house full of people waiting for dinner to arrive tonight - and then for the pizza to be lukewarm and the wings to be ice cold - wasn't fun."}
{"text":"Finally a solid option in my neck of the woods. I've never been to a Barro's Pizza until a few weeks ago when they opened up one a couple of miles from my house.  They have a spacious dining room with a self serve soda machine, including Diet Dr. Pepper, and one flat screen TV in one corner of the room. They might want to consider getting another TV. You order at the cashier and they bring your food to you. My wife and I go here when we don't feel like cooking.  Major kudos to Barro's Pizza for not price gouging on pasta like a lot of places. Seriously, I've been to casual restaurants that want to charge $10-$12 dollars for penne with meatballs. At Barro's, you can get a small plate for less than $4 dollars. And that's plenty to fill an adult up at lunch. I tried their Calzone for $8.95. It was okay, nothing to write home about. It included a couple of toppings. They certainly don't make the world's greatest pizza but it's decent and very economically priced. My wife loves the garlic bread, but it's a bit too garlicky for my taste. Note to management, start serving artichokes for pizza and don't chop those onions so small.  Most of the time my wife and I spend about $7-$12 dollars to eat here unless we order a pizza. They have sandwiches which I haven't tried yet. I am eating my way thru their entire menu so I'll eventually try all their offerings."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Got a pepperoni with black olives bell peppers and jalapeños.. Mmmmmm. It was good. And the crust nice and toasty. Yummy."}
{"text":"Love the Barro's Pizza but really for some reason the one at Pavillion's seems more generous on the toppings and more seasoning in Sauce.  We live closer to the New one, but sometimes go to the Pavillion's and so we get a Pizza to go . . .Tell the owners to work out the differences as we really like the CRUST, but love the flavor & like to be able to count on same thing at ALL locations."}
{"text":"Welcoming atmosphere, service was fast and food was good. Beat the lunch hour so the waiting time was 0. Got the Wednesday special BBQ chicken pizza and 12 hot honey wings. Try them, i think you will like them."}
{"text":"Second Barro's pizza we visited while in Tempe on vacation recently. We were very happy with the food quality, the friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the restaurant.  Having visited often when I used to come to town for business, it was nice to once again enjoy a Barro's white pizza. I asked them to skip the ricotta and the chopped tomatoes on top and add pepperoni, which they did. It was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered an extra large pepperoni, sausage, meatball, bacon, onion, and green pepper pizza for pickup as I left work. I was told it would be 15 to 20 minutes. I arrived, it was ready, took it home ----hot and delicious. Always nice staff when I go in."}
{"text":"Barro's is basically a Chuck e Cheese kind of place, only without the animatronics, less arcade games, more adult friendly and WAY better food.  I was very pleased with both the thin crust pizza and wings, both very good.  The environment is a bit lacking, but it's ok if you want a quick bite and unlimited soda refills.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Just tried Barron's Pizza. Will definitely be back. Best pizza have found in area. Tried oreganos, rays, 24thstreet, . First 2 mentioned were just ok. Barros is better by far  Tried again disappointed order was incorrect and skimpy on toppings. Asked for thin crust and was regular . First time ordered was much better , will try different location"}
{"text":"Disappointed as we were excited that a barros was opening up across the street. Today was our first time ordering from this location and probably the last. I asked for light cheese got what looks like 2x the extra cheese and when the girl at the counter asked the manager he quickly looked and said yeah thats light cheese. It was also warm not out the oven hot pizza. The wings were barely sauced. I guess we will continue to make the drive to the anthem store."}
{"text":"Went back on Sunday, 11/26/2017 to give this place one more try (perhaps the bugs had been worked out) and the 24 traditional chicken wings came with little or no sauce on them and were half naked.  We had to actually pour sauce on over half of the wings when we got home. They were tough and overcooked - PASS!  Ordered a large traditional pepperoni pizza and a small cheese which tasted good once you could actually get it into your mouth.  The dough was so under cooked on both pizzas that when you picked up a piece of pizza, it fell over limp, not how pizza should be cooked.  We collectively agreed as a family of 5 NEVER to go to this Barros ever again.  :-("}
{"text":"Every time we go to Phoenix we get Barros the pizza is amazing and the wings are good too. Don't forget the Blue cheese"}
{"text":"Lied they always tell you 25 minutes you show up next thing you know you have to wait and other 25 minutes just tell me the f...... Truth I hate this place don't get me wrong I love this pizza and wings but never again this location sucks"}
{"text":"I usually like Barros but the young lady working the counter was so rude. First I waited almost 5 minutes before she came to counter with no apology for the wait (she was on her cell phone). She took my order and it seemed like I was bugging her, Next I ask for a side of marinara sauce, she comes back from the back and says it's .55¢. Told her it's fine cuz I didn't want to run my card again. She then just threw it away. No need to be a little b-word."}
{"text":"Called in a carry out order of thin crust with cheese, black olives and green pepper.  Husband told store that crust was undercooked last time and to please make sure crust/ pizza was cooked properly.  Picked up pizza, brought it home which wasn't far away.  Pizza was tasty, but crust was soft, not quite soggy.  More like a pie crust, not a pizza crust."}
{"text":"Stop by on Friday for lunch and hit up their lunch special. For only $4 you get two slices and a drink. Works for me. I just beat the lunch crowd who seemed to be going after the same special. As busy as they were, ordering and service was pretty quick. I enjoyed the Hawaiian and pepperoni and both were good. My brother and I added a few honey hot wings, extra crispy and they were as good as always. All in all, who can complain in a $4 lunch. Not this guy."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch and were pleasantly surprised. The kids had cheese pizza that was fresh and will cooked. The Hawaiian pizza was delicious also. Lunch prices were very reasonable.   We ordered a take out pizza a few days later. We ordered a half cheese and half pepperoni. The pizza was perfectly cooked and the two sides were even. There was a lot of pepperoni.  Again the price was reasonable.   We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. They not only catered to our allergies but when they brought out a pizza with a missing topping, they not only made a new one but gave us the other one for free"}
{"text":"Barros delivered on time during the super bowl, and the vegetarian was loaded with fresh vegetables."}
{"text":"Just stumbled in with a couple roommates of mine we are always on the hunt for some amazing hot wings and i have to say these are the best we had sauce was very flavorful and the wings had a nice crunch to them forsure going back soon chairs were very comfortable customer service was great and the places just had a great vibe to it"}
{"text":"Cannot go wrong with the Kona Specialty Pizza. Have been in love with barros since it opened up in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I think we lucked out with this location judging by the reviews, however, I prefer the Tempe Kyrene location. The pizzas on the two occasions have been fine. The wings are not quite the same as the other location I am used to. They don't seem as hot and were soggy. This is a great pizza place if you are looking for a more dense hand tossed type of pizza with lots of cheese and meats.  If you are crazy about meat, try the Mega Meat pizza. It's insane how much meat they put on that pizza. It has Pepperoni, Ham, Sausage, Bacon, and Meatball. Hence the mega meat title. It's almost like they put a pound of meat on that baby. The service is good, I think a better time to come is early evening when they are not so slammed at this popular location."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and the breadsticks with cheese are the best we've had. Tonight we called in an order for pickup. It was ready right on time, but I had made a mistake and ordered bread with cheese when I meant to order breadsticks with cheese. The personable employee at pickup said no problem and an order of breadsticks would be ready in a few minutes. When we tried to pay for the more expensive breadsticks, she said there would be no additional charge! Now this is super customer service and you can be sure this Barro's is now on our favorites list."}
{"text":"Barros has always been one of my favorite pizza's. Don't call this location for delivery. The girl who took my order stated delivery would be 45 minutes. More like 1 1/2 hours. When I called back to see why it was taking so long she changed the delivery time and said the deliveries were going to take longer. If she had told me an accurate time when I called in the order I would have placed my order with a different location.I will call the Indian Bend location next time."}
{"text":"So glad they have a Barro's down in SW Phoenix. Pizza is great, customer service is awesome."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and the staff is friendly; however, don't count on them honoring their 2 large 1 topping pizza special. I've tried ordering it 3 times in the past using their phone app or website and never get the special. It's always higher when the charge goes through. I consider it false advertising and misleading. Tonight I ordered over the phone and specifically asked for the $20.99 deal. If I get charged more, it will be my last time ordering from them. Good pizza yes, but if you offer a special, you need to honor it. If you can't, I won't honor you with my business.  Thanks for the reply about ordering to get a deal. I've tried your button online and it appears to be a dead link. Doesn't show up in your phone app either. I'd check your site hyperlinks and perhaps add your deals section to your phone app. The only way I've been able to get the deal is to phone in an order. FYI: I've used a computer Google Chrome browser and Apple Safari browser and found the deals link to go nowhere, I haven't tried Internet Explorer. I really love your pizza, but not having the deals work without calling should be a simple fix. Hope you can fix this and I'll be able to make a simple order and not need to call your really friendly employees."}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes, this isn't the best I've had, but it's not the worst either. Ordered takeout for a quick weeknight dinner and it got the job done.   The Barros Special had a decent amount of toppings, but according to my dad, who had been coming here since they opened, they've actually started cutting back on the toppings in recent months. So that's a bummer. The pizza was definitely on the saltier side, so much so that after one slice I was done.  Phone service was quick and friendly, hardly any hold time - maybe 1-2 minutes. The prices here are on par with competitors like Domino's. Overall it's a decent chain pizza joint, just not my personal preference in terms of taste. Will update if and when I go inside."}
{"text":"This is your typical (in every good way) local greasy pizza joint but the wings are amazing!!!! We get Barros like, more than we should admit and live dangerously close but it's soooooo good. They also do pizza by the slice lunch specials that can't be beat. I love this place. Wings come in boneless or regular and tons of different sauces."}
{"text":"Needing to eat gluten free, I always have to pay more. And I am okay with it as long as my food is good. But today the quality of food I received was not up to par to what I paid. My pizza was missing ingredients that I had paid for, there was so much cheese that my pizza was super soggy. Every time I tried to get a slice, my pizza slices would fall apart in pieces. My wings were disgusting, half my to go box was nothing but sauce and trying to eat was a mess.  Barros is usually my got to place for pizza, but I think this location is not for me."}
{"text":"I ordered this pizza for delivery. It was on time, but it showed up with the cheese and toppings completely fallen off to the side (see photo). It's a shame because it seemed like it would have tasted really good if it was intact. Wouldn't recommend for home delivery."}
{"text":"Finally! A decent pizza place in the neighborhood that has indoor seating! After being disappointed by the area pizza joints, I had given up on hoping I could find a place to go without driving 20 minutes for eat-in pizza.  Of course, Rustic pizza is in the same shopping center, but good luck finding a spot to sit down.   Barro's Pizza has a roomy interior, with plenty of seating. Parmesean and hot flakes are at each table, and a meager but tasty salad bar up front to help you stave off your hunger until the pie is finished.  I went in and ordered a personal small pepperoni pizza, salad, and drink. I was given a salad bowl and helped myself to the salad bar, a drink, and then sat down and ate until my pizza was delivered tableside.  The pizza was hot. Really hot. Right out of the oven hot. That made me feel really good -- I hate cold, warm, or reheated-tasting pizza. This was FRESH. The pepperoni was really spicy, and crisped on the edges the way pepperoni is supposed to be!  The crust was dry, with a nice coating of corn meal on the outside, nearly perfect (If I had to really nitpick, the crust was slightly too bready). The moz cheese was good quality and it was everything I was missing from our local pizza places.  I would like to see a better salad bar, with more options. It's pretty sparse and there's a lot of room for improvement.  They also have subs and pasta, which I intend to try in the (very near) future"}
{"text":"I'm not pizza person but my son asked me to come here for pizza after Tae Kwon Do, he loved it!  The young man who was taking the order was very nice and friendly and the pizza came freshly in few minutes, was all good."}
{"text":"Did an XL Original White Pizza + Meatball + Pepperoni, a dozen Garlic Parmesan boneless, a dozen Spicy BBQ boneless and a large Garden Salad.    Delivery was 30-40 minutes, the delivery driver was very friendly and personable, and the food was still very hot when it arrived.  Hot enough that we didn't need to throw it in the oven like we usually do when pizza places deliver.  A+ for delivery and freshness of our order!  The pizza itself was massive, original crust.   I thought it was OK but I didn't think it was great.  Did I say massive?  3 of us finished less than half the pizza, and on the 2nd night I slathered it with Red Hot and ranch which was magical.  The boneless wings were the winners for me.  The chicken was tender and I like the flavor of their garlic Parmesan wings dipped in Red Hot.  Their hot BBQ wing sauce is also good.  Also, unlike most places, they will give you extra wing sauces and ranch dressings on the side at no charge.  Most places skimp on the sauces these days, so kudos to Barro's for that.   The garden salad was good, greens seemed fresh and the honey mustard dressing on the side was also good.    I would order from Barro's again and look forward to trying the thin crust."}
{"text":"We loved our take out pizzas from this Barro's location. The crust was amazing, toppings were just right in proportion.... Well done guys."}
{"text":"How hard is it on order of wings to split it into two different sauces?  They will only make it in one flavor.  Other places do it. My wife got she wanted and I got nothing. Never coming back."}
{"text":"So happy they opened a new Barros across the street from my place. My kids love the food. They have good daily lunch specials. Any time the order has been wrong, which is very few and far between, they have always been really cool about it.  But again, few and far between. Maybe 2 times since 2004"}
{"text":"I want to give this location three stars, but I'm trying to be nice in hopes they improve upon being the Barros I know and love. I've loved Barros since they put a location in at the Pavilions in Scottsdale. That location has always been amazing and very well priced. Now that they put one in my neck of the woods, I was very excited to try this new location and also introduce my boyfriend to Barros. I have to say I was a bit disappointed.  The only thing we ordered was a 12\" pizza. yup, a small one for us to split. Pizza's don't take that long to cook to begin with.  Finally after 30 minutes of waiting (yes, I timed it), I go up to talk to someone and the girl sweeping helps me out. mind you, it's not busy at all. There's maybe five tables occupied if you count ours, too. She goes to check on it and brings out the pizza. Tells us that they're sorry, they messed up on the first pizza (which could be avoided by following orders) so they had to make another one. Good customer service would mean coming to tell us 15 minutes prior that they made a mistake and it's going to be a little bit for them to remake a pizza. We would have been totally fine if someone would have said something. Here we are thinking they just forgot about us.   The pizza itself was completely unlike the one at the other Scottsdale location. When I think of Barros, I think of crust and how they have the best crust. Very bummed that it wasn't it's usual fluffy cust, but flat and barely anything there. Funny thing, as we finished our pizza, the people that had been sitting next to us for quite a while had an employee ask them if they got their pizza yet and they said, \"no\".  The pros of this visit are that they have oregano you can use yourself, self-serve fountain drinks and  They did let us keep the pizza they messed up on. At least my boyfriend said he enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for pizza. We love their cheese and always order extra. Just wish it wasn't so pricey."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I know it's a chain but this location rocks! I come at least once a week.  I got my usual, the half meatball sub with chips for only $3.50!  Be sure to check out the salad bar. The service is friendly and food is ready to pick up when promised."}
{"text":"Our family loves Barros! Their pizza is by far our favorite. A couple of weeks ago we ordered a pizza, for delivery, after over 75 minutes and no pizza we contacted them. A young girl answered the phone and said the driver had gotten lost, she apologized but essentially said \"nothing I can do.\" Our pizza finally arrived, it was so cold :( My husband was so upset, he called back and asked to speak with the manager. Again he apologized but also followed with \"what do you want me to do.\" His demeanor lacked consideration for our position. We did finally have another pizza delivered to replace the cold one. We gave them another shot just yesterday. Ordered a pizza, sadly again when it arrived it was ridiculously cold. This time though we didn't even bother to call. Lesson learned, simply not ordering from there again. Sad face."}
{"text":"I was visiting my husband's family and they decided to pick up some pizza from here. I'm normally a thin crust lover but found that their pizza was quite satisfying for a medium crust. The pizza was cheesy and still stringy because it was still hot. It had a moderate amount of sauce (and I'm the type that likes lightly sauced pie) yet it was still good. Sauce was not overwhelming and not too sweet or overly seasoned. The dough is soft and not crisp on the bottom of the pie which is fine by me. The pepperoni was crisp on the edges.   I would return!"}
{"text":"I usually love Barros but this location is horrible! Staff are a bunch of either HS or just out of HS girls. We dined in and these girls were literally joking and screaming right next to our table. Our order came out at different times and didn't even get out salad. The food was ehh not worth was we paid. I gave 1 star because of the staff mainly and the cleanliness of the facility. Won't be coming back even though it is literally 5 mins from my house.. Super disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my family's go to pizza place. Thin crust cheese pizza is the usual since it's my son's favorite but if the parents get the chance, we always go for Barro's best. And always, it's with chicken wings, any flavor just not spicy."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now. I love that it's so close to home and I don't have to venture into Tempe for a decent piece of pizza. Everything has always came out really good and when I order for pick up its ready when I get there no waiting or anything."}
{"text":"Okay, first I will say they have awesome lunch specials. Super cheap and a lot of food. The salad bar is great with a lot of options. This place seems to have a Chicago theme going on, however, this is not anything like Chicago pizza. The pizza isn't bad, just not that good. I prefer thinner crust with less cheese. I would say this pizza in along the lines of little ceasers or Pizza Hut. However, it is still is a great deal and not bad."}
{"text":"I used to receive delivery orders from the Anthem location about thirty minutes faster than I receive orders from this new location, that is 0.4 miles away.  Even if you include a large tip with the hopes that your food will arrive soon and warm; nope."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite pizza places. The food is great, the owners are friendly, and the atmosphere is clean.   This new location is setup very similar to others I've been to, so there's a familiarity when walking in the front door. The quality of their food is incredible. On this occasion I tried, for the first time, their 6\" Club sandwich. It was almost too much and I almost wish I hadn't ordered boneless wings as well. Almost.   Can't leave out their pizza. I haven't found better pizza anywhere and I've tried. I highly recommend this location, or any Barro's for that matter."}
{"text":"Solid pizza place! The prices are good and the pizza was great. The staff is very friendly as well, it could use a couple more TV's but one of my new favorite spots."}
{"text":"Just don't do it if you're from out of town.   The pizza girl who takes your order for delivery says 40 minutes... guess that's code for 70 minutes.   It really wasn't a huge order and the delivery driver said they got busy on the reason for being late.   I understand locals dollars mean more than a semi annual guest.   Even if you have a whim for random greasy pizza... Don't do it... Please...just don't.   You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad, but I ordered a meal online, came 5 minutes after my suggested pickup time and when I was finally helped, they couldn't find my order and tried to convince me that I ordered from a different varroa before I showed them my screenshot of the online order for THEIR location.  Then she went back and mysteriously found my order slip and told me it would be another 3-5 minutes.  It was more like 15 minutes meaning they didn't actually start to make my pasta and meatball sandwich until 10 minutes after I arrived.  And once it was ready, they didn't tell me, rather just tossed it on the counter while I sat on the other side of the room.  If you're going to order from here, call it in."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Barros I am happy! I always get their pizza and wings special. Food is amazing and service is great."}
{"text":"Worst experience. I called to ask about a special order that I have gotten before at the Peoria location, and I spoke to a girl named Jen on the phone. She was so rude literally laughing at me on the phone then I asked to speak to the manager and she said he's to busy to speak to me and if I want to then I need to call back later! I said forget it, her tone was rude and before she even asked if they could do it laughed and said probably not and I actually had to say we'll go ask... don't just guess. The Peoria store are fantastic! I have never had a complaint but someone dropped the ball on training Scottsdale! I will be going to Rays pizza... never coming back"}
{"text":"Barros has the best subs, and salads.  They are inexpensive, and filling.  The spaghetti and meatballs are very tasty too.  :-).  I always get delivery.   They say 45 minutes but it never takes that long.   Great service when I call for delivery.  Food is always on point.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Stay away. Their pizza always comes undercooked and management is unwilling to do anything about it."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in town!  Their ranch is really good.  Crust is fluffy and chewy.  They deliver.  It is Pricey for pizza and wings though.  Wish they had canolis for dessert!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza but they have an awesome lunch special you can get two slices for under five bucks which is just amazing I recommend this to anybody looking for a cheap bite to eat with awesome flavor"}
{"text":"They changed their pizza and it taste better...also you can ask for thin crust now when I couldn't before!! Great job!! Will always be back!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer at Barro's for almost 25 years and I am sorry to say the new Scottsdale location on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. gets a one star from us. On our 2nd. visit ( Our mistake) we again were very disappointed to say the least. We ordered a thin crust pizza and a dozen wings. The crust on the pizza was soggy at best and the celery  that came with the wings looked like a truck had run it over which was also how it was on our first visit. How can you screw up celery? We will revert back to the Pavillions  location where there never seems to be a problem. I doubt the F.L.R. location will be around long as again like our first visit we were the only two in the place at 6:30 PM. I guess that should have been a warning to us."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff here is so super sweet, it is always a quick in and out experience.  Delicious pizza and mozzarella sticks."}
{"text":"The staff here goes above and beyond on a consistent basis. Never have I been so impressed with a waitstaff especially since its counter service style. They are always friendly, welcoming and stay busy whether its helping guests, or cleaning up the dining room. Food is always amazing and consistent for the always cheap prices. I love the patio and that you can get a pitcher of beer! Kudos to the management for creating such a great environment for their staff to thrive in, seems like everyone is happy to work there and you can tell through the great job performances and guest engagement. Thanks for always taking care of us! We love this Barros staff!"}
{"text":"For the price point of this restaurant, I'll give it 5 stars.  The lunch slice deals are cheap, the pizza in general is priced very low, they actually have some good beers on draft and bottle, and the quality of the pizza (for the price range) is good.  Glad to have them in the neighborhood.  Staff is always nice and pleasant, too."}
{"text":"My family is a fan of Barro's so we were happy to hear that this location delivered to our houses. Got the pizza last night. Delivery took around an hour. The pizza came hot. It was in good shape, not too greasy, well cooked. Yum!"}
{"text":"Newest Barros in our area. The restaurant is very clean. The employees are nice too. Always have great hot slices. For 2 slices of pizza and a drink you pay under 5 bucks!  They also have the best ranch dressing ever."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and the staff is nice.  The atmosphere is lacking though.  They don't play any music and they only have one TV in the back.  They are usually dead around dinner time so I am guessing they do a better lunch.  We noticed the same thing at their Grayhawk location.  More tv's with sports and play some classic rock.  That would make the experience 100 times better.  Oh, and every table in the place was dirty.  That's not good!"}
{"text":"I have seven kids we spend a few hundred dollars a month at Barros Pizza always take out. I have always seen the salad bar but never had time to get it. I love salad bars especially at a pizza joint. Well finally I was able to go and get that delicious looking salad bar. Needless to say I didn't get the salad bar because they wanted $7 and change for a large bowl that you could only fill once...wow. Because of them being so cheap we will never eat at Barros ever again. I wanted that salad bar for so long, what a disappointment."}
{"text":"I love Barros. This place makes great pizza like the rest. The restaurant always seems quiet and it looks like a great place for a party."}
{"text":"Waited almost an hour for a sandwich on a Wednesday night. Then the sandwich I got was the wrong one and only had bread and meat/ cheese. Now I've waited another 15 mins for the correct sandwich. Not even busy here tonight. Watched a few customers who came in a half hour after me get their food. Food might be good but I don't know I still waiting for my food. The LA Dodgers will loose the World Series before I eat. I guess it's rays pizza next time."}
{"text":"First time to order take out, sausage pizza is scrumptious, the help is grand; pizza and a self-built salad, made for perfect evening at home to watch Cardinals lose....despite Cardinals lackluster, the dining was tops."}
{"text":"Fastest delivery ever. My pizza is always perfect and I'm always satisfied with their service."}
{"text":"My go-to for lunch.  I visit this location 1-2 times a week for their lunch (2 big slices and a drink under $5. Cant beat it)  The front desk girls are awesome and always friendly with me - nice they always remember my order haha.   I sometimes order out the breadsticks with cheese - amazing as well."}
{"text":"Hopefully this will go passed the manager and to the owners of this place. First off. Waited 20 minutes for a salad and had asked for it twice. Finally had to go up there and wait for the salad. When the girl delivered my wings she just dropped them and left didn't ask if I needed anything just walked away. Then the second order of wings came out for my mother and same thing dropped them and left. Finally they brought the meatball sub we had to stop the girl to ask for napkins and a fork. Finally we get to the end of our meal and I need a box. So instead of waiting for someone because I knew that was going to take awhile. I go to the front and ask one of the girls for a box who had I guess just put food in her mouth. If you're going to eat something eat it in the back not in front of your customers. I'm in the industry and this honestly upsets me."}
{"text":"So I'm here for training in Phoenix and we are staying at a hotel. We called to order food because it said we were 2.7miles away from this location. We were ready to order a couple of pizzas, chicken wings, and breadsticks. We were told they couldn't deliver because we are out of their zone to deliver.  However, when I called back to ask about their delivery radius they didn't have an answer. They asked if I was at the address I just gave the call before, I heard some whispering and then she came on again saying, \"yeah, sorry, we don't deliver there.\"  No answer to my question. We were really excited to order from them but now... they have lost my business and I will continue to let others know about their customer service.  It's not about being able to deliver but the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible service phone orders always get delivered wrong an not the way u want ur pizza cuz that girl who takes the orders is very rude an unprofessional  an does not lisen what u need to order she hengs up the phone on u when u tell her can u plz confirm my order wont be calling here again !!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was better then a lot of pizza I've had because the sause had great flavor to top it.i feep alotbof the pizza places here lack of good flavor. the staff is extremely friendly.its no NY pizzza but its doughy yet tasty the doughy ness is why I'm only giving 4 stars the dough lacks flavor .but ay its not ny"}
{"text":"Ordered food at 4:19pm on a Sunday, not that busy of a time. Another phone call and an hour and 15 minutes later it arrived. A nice young man noted he was the only driver today. He took care of our order, it was accurate and hot. The meatball sub we ordered was awesome, the salad, very fresh."}
{"text":"Well, it's edible. That's the nicest thing I can say. We ordered two gluten-free pizzas for delivery and they showed up only partially cooked. I had to bake them for another 10 minutes in the oven. Even still, the cheese was really gloppy and gross. It must've been okay, I suppose, because I did eat it. My kids, however, did not. I had to make them a separate dinner. The Caesar salad was decent and the ranch dressing pretty good. There are many other pizza places in town - choose one of them instead."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Barro's pizza, and I have to say, this location is back!  They made a couple of changes to the way they make their meatballs and its spot on!  Fantastic customer service, great managers, and nothing less than the best pizza anywhere!  If you haven't tried Barro's pizza, do yourself a favor and place an order tonight!  Thank you again Barro's - one very happy and loyal customer!"}
{"text":"After waiting 2 hours for a Dominos pizza that was never delivered and being hung up on by the Dominos manager, my wife and I still really wanted pizza. It was 9:55 pm and Barros closed at 10 pm but I gave them a call anyways not expecting to be able to order. I was pleasantly surprised that they took my order and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes so I headed over to pick it up. When I got there I was greeted by Nick who was in the back and came right up, apologizing that he was in the back helping train some new employees. He reviewed my order and realized it was slightly incorrect and immediately headed back and fixed my pizza that had just been put in the oven. After only 2-3 mins he came back up, apologized and then proceeded to give me a discount for having to wait on him...I was so happy that I was even able to order 5 minutes before closing I would have taken any pizza no problem, but Nick made the whole experience exceptional. After having such a poor experience with another pizza chain it was such a relief to come in here and be treated with such respect and service that was above and beyond. I would highly recommend this place! Excellent job Nick and keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their pizza and wings are so delicious, I would much rather this over any other pizza place around! It is seriously the perfect consistency of cheese to crust! Aaah! My mouth just waters thinking of it. They have an amazing lunch menu that is Monday - Sunday! I know all week long you can get a good slice of pizza and a drink for $4! Amazing, I know!! Anyways if you're near a barros get yourself some pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"Was quick and convenient. You pretty much get what you pay for. I got a drink, salad and slice of pizza for about $5. Salad was decent sized except the lettuce was hardly cut up, leaving huge chunks to contend with, being they didn't give me a knife. Pizza tastes pretty good, unfortunately the top of it slid off the dough :(. They have plenty of seating and outdoor patio. Lots of tvs on which all play sports, so I was pretty happy about that. I'll give it another try but have mild expectations next time. Fast American/Italian I suppose."}
{"text":"Not sure if we came in on an off night or what happened. We called in and ordered a large pizza and 24 wings and were told it would be ready in about 25 minutes. Ok, no problem. I get there about 30 minutes later and am told it's going to be a wait for the wings, but the pizza is ready to go. That's fine, as long as they're fresh, right? Nearly 20 minutes go by and I'm assured \"they're almost out, maybe 3 minutes for your wings\". At this point I'm frustrated at why it's taking so long for chicken wings. Finally we get our food and I ask for marinara and some ranch, the girl goes to the back to grab it. I didn't realize this was another inconvenience because it took her another 5 minutes to grab two cups of sauce. Right after, she goes straight to texting on her phone along with everyone else working tonight. Once we get home, we come to find out that our \"fresh\" wings are cold and the pizza is spotted in dough bubbles. Ridiculous.   We spent over $30 on a disappointing dinner. We'll think about Rosati's across the street next time, because this Barro's has lost our business."}
