{"text":"How very disappointing.  My husband dropped by to get take out for our Friday night dinner.  He ordered the Tom Yum soup, Singapore noodle (chicken), spring rolls, and finally, a beef curry dish.  All, except for the spring rolls, tasted horrible.  Having lived in Bangkok for 2 years never have I seen Tom Yum soup that had noodles in it. The chicken Singapore noodles lacked flavour and to my surprise had huge chunks of broccoli and red pepper in it.  The beef curry was bland as well.  The whole meal was  a little over $50...wouldn't mind paying this amount had the food tasted like it should. What a shame and a waste of money.  Will order pizza next time at our local pizzeria.   Dissatisfied customer"}
{"text":"Worst Thai food ever. The Tom Yum soup was so bland and tasteless and there are very limited vegetarian options; only three things for the main course (salad, tofu fried rice and tofu teriyaki). We came here twice. The first time the waitress didn't understand english well and she said we can order dishes without fish and oyster sauce, but that's not true. Almost every sauce is pre-made and not vegetarian friendly. If you are a vegetarian, this place is not worth considering. I had the veggie salad the second time and it was pretty good. The salad is the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars... Without it, this place is not worth visiting."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED. The food is Okay, get the general tao, pad tai or some of the salads. The price you are paying is  for the location since the food is only passable at best but the decor and atmosphere is nice"}
{"text":"Open Sesame  I went here for lunch and was somewhat put off by the fact that my sister and I were the only customers at the time.  This made us a bit weary, but the time constraint and our love of szechuan convinced us to stay.  For starters, the lunch menu offers a soup, main and dessert for $20.  Not too shabby.  I had the spicy Thaie Coco, the Crispy beef and green tea ice cream as a dessert.  All in all the quality of the food was good, the vegetables fresh, and the portions fair.   The service however was a bit slow considering we were the only ones there, but the waitress was very polite and friendly.  They also do Dim Sum and sushi.  I'd go back, this time to try their General Tao poutine.  Fuggedaboutit'"}
{"text":"Excellent! We were five and hade a bit of every thing spring rolls , dim sum, Singapore noodles, beef red curry , won ton soup and the Thai coco soup. They were all very good however the noodles were average. The red curry and coco soup I thought were excellent. We had one desert the molten lava cake which was tasty. We went on a Friday night and it was not very busy. The service was very friendly and good. To drink we had a tea , a beer and a large sparkling water and the bill was $150.00 which I think was well worth it."}
{"text":"Horrendous experience a couple weeks ago here at this restaurant.  Sat down at the table for almost 30 minutes waiting for someone.  When we finally got our food, all THREE orders were wrong.  Not even a simple apology was given to us. If your touring the area, go somewhere else.  If you're a local, they'll probably treat you better."}
{"text":"Lunch time review, good food fast cafeteria like service.  Had the general Tao poutine = amazing 5/5 would eat again."}
{"text":"I had a fabulous experience there. The staff were extremely friendly, it seemed like a family owned atmosphere. It's difficult to find quick food to go in that location after 5. The food was great. Large selection of anything Asian. They gave me some free salad rolls to go that were excellent."}
{"text":"This is an overpriced lunch restaurant serving dinner and it's still overpriced. The service was more than lackluster (we had to beg for our water glasses to be refilled.) The spring roll was loosely and nothing special. The \"dim sum\" was doughy and the sauce wasn't very good. The main course with shrimp had *5* shrimp and the other main course is better produced by fast food chains.   This is dinner, folks, the menu needs to be better. The food more interesting and more authentic, of it's not authentic then at least interesting. And seriously, you can't manage to fill a glass of water without prompting?  Beautiful decor. Should have saved up for a chef."}
{"text":"I'd rate Sesame a 3.5 stars if that were an option. I ate there last night for the first time after a recommendation from a friend. We had: - vege dumplings (nothing special) - shrimp dumplings (very tasty) - salmon tartar (nice presentation and quite good) - grilled eel maki roll (standard) - General Tao tofu (great)  Overall food was good quality and good value for the price, the service was good and the atmosphere was fun. I would definitely go back.   Although we didn't try it one thing of note on the menu is the General Tao Poutine, this sounds so dirty yet potentially so tasty. Would love to hear from anyone who tried it."}
{"text":"Tried the orange General Tso chicken entree and found the flavor...confusing. Maybe it should either be General Tso or orange chicken, not both? Also on the expensive side for what you get.   Otherwise convenient location and easy take out option."}
{"text":"Les prix son vraiment bas et la nourriture est vraiment bonne, le restaurant est vraiment beau, mais on nous a accrocher sur le tippage à la fin et sa C bien quelque chose qui m'agace, mais j'y retournerais son aucun problème"}
{"text":"We ordered: - Chicken pad thai - General Tso Tofu - Imperial Rolls  TLDR: Over priced food court quality food  The pad thai was slimy, poorly spiced, and contained giant pieces of celery that I took out because they didn't look appealing to eat.  The general tso's tofu was definitely frozen (shipped in from somewhere) and fried, then coated in bland sauce. The only nice thing about it was the sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  The imperial rolls were bland and also obviously frozen.  Would not recommend this place. Do yourself a favor and walk to chinatown and get good asian food."}
{"text":"What a terrible restaurant. Came here tonight with my boyfriend and we both were pissed we wasted money here. The service was terrible and the food was just as bad. My phone was dead but this place has taught me a valuable lesson: check yelp reviews first. The decor here is wonderful and has a really great atmosphere. Although I thought the tables were really close together.  They have a small and strange menu. Its fusion Asian food including different Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese dishes, ie. pho, Thai curries, general tso's chicken, dim sum etc. Also for whatever reason they have Asian fusion poutines. They also have a huge selection of teas and wine I opted for the peanut chicken and my boyfriend opted for the general tso's tofu, he also got an order of Imperial rolls, it wasn't clear on the menu what they were. My boyfriend asked the waitress if they were vegan and stressed he doesn't eat any animal products very politely. She assured him they were fine.  The imperial rolls came out fairly quickly, there was 2 in a serving and they were fairly big. But they came with fish sauce. Thanks waitress. Unfortunately the waitress was so hard to find we weren't able to ask for a different type of sauce. We waited a ridiculously long time for our food. There were people who came in way after us being served ahead of us. The server wasn't friendly and we asked 3 times for water before getting any.   To finally get to the food, both me and my boyfriend thought it was terrible. Mine had no flavor at all. None. I had to add a bunch of rooster sauce and soya sauce for it to have some sort of flavor. My boyfriend also had to add a bunch of rooster sauce, and also agreed it was bland. Neither general tso's or peanut sauce chicken should be flavorless. Perhaps the only good thing I can mention about the meal was the fact that my boyfriend's tofu was crispy, which doesn't happen often with tofu sadly. The meal came to about $20 each, for really shitty food. Not worth it at all. Definitely won't be back here."}
{"text":"I had lunch there and it was absolutely delicious!  Plus the price was only $15 for a chicken basil stir fry and rice.  Fantastic!  But really more of a fast food type joint so I wouldn't go there for dinner even though it's supposedly a sit-down resto at night."}
{"text":"Stopped by here because the place we were planning to go was closed. I'm glad we wound up here. I had the General Tao Tofu Poutine. Surprisingly delicious. My sister had the Vege salad, which was also great, and my dad had the Won Ton soup, which he loved. We split the black sesame ice cream for dessert, which I recommend. It was sort of nutty, and tasted vaguely like peanut butter ice cream. I thought it was the perfect amount to split between two or three people to cap our meal."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé un plat de Hunan. Portion particulièrement petite mais délicieux. J'ai pu piquer dans l'assiette de la personne qui m'accompagnait. Sa poutine au Général Tao était délicieuse, vraiment  Assez abordable.  45$ pour 2, 1 bière chaque, pourboire inclus.  Excellent service"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment, so I won't even bother writing the rest of this review in full sentences.  - Everything tastes like teriyaki sauce, as my friend put it. - Poutine was blah, same issue as above. - Wine was not bad - Ordered basil beef, but I didn't taste basil"}
{"text":"Fresh and good portions.  Nice Atmosphere.  But for anyone that is used to authentic Asian, this will fall short and is a bit bland."}
{"text":"Ce n'est pas le meilleur thaï à Montréal, mais ça dépanne très bien quand vous êtes dans l'ouest du Vieux-Montréal."}
{"text":"Terrible lunch.   Their chicken was exceptionally dry, and when I complained about it I was told their chickens have lots of extra protein so this is normal.  Huh?  On a positive note, they swapped my dish for another, which unfortunately was a sub-par pad Thai.   Meh - at least they had tall-boy Sapporo cans to wash it down with.  That, and they're on OpenTable so you'll get some points for a reservation."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. Service was great. Highly recommend the fresh spring rolls, dumplings, pad thai and general Tao chicken."}
{"text":"I wouldn't order their Pad thai again. It lacked flavour."}
{"text":"Agreed with Susan W.  Disappointing.  It took 5-10 minutes to be acknowledged by the wait staff.  It was the first Thursday of Jazz Festival, however the restaurant was not even close to full capacity, in fact, it only had a few tables when I arrived.  I ordered a Sapporo beer and a Crevettes Cary Rouge (Shrimp - Red Curry).  The sauce was okay, but the dish was average at best."}
{"text":"Nous avons mangé à deux dans ce restaurent. Suite à une erreur de la cuisine, nous avons reçu un plat en erreur. Le gérant, Sebastien Harnois s'est par la suite brutalement précipité pour nous empêcher de manger la salade que nous pensions avoir reçu en entré de la formule. Nous avons été traité par la suite comme des voleurs alors que l'erreur venait de la cuisine!!!! Merci du Service et bravo le professionnalisme !!!"}
{"text":"One word:  amazing.  My husband and I have been lucky enough to live in/near places known for their Chinese food (San Fran, Philly, NYC) and Sesame completely caught us off guard.  My husband had General Tso chicken and said it was the best he's ever had--anywhere in the world.  I had chicken stir fry in a peanut sauce which was also delicious.  The rice side wasn't great and the won-ton soup was a bit different.  They also had some unique drinks that I was excited about.  I had a ginger juice that I've never seen anywhere else.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Première fois à ce resto asiatique de type fusion. Après avoir regardé le menu sur le net je me préparais à commander du tartare de saumon et une salade. Arrivé sur place, tout semblait bon. Le général tao semble être leur spécialité, en plus, ils ont concocté une poutine au général Tao. Pourquoi pas essayer...? Une très bonne portion avec de gros morceaux de poulet de général tao sur de bonnes frites croustillantes et du fromage. Bien que l'idée peut sembler étrange le résultat était très bon. Les prix sont abordables, malgré que leur heure de pointe est le midi, j'ai pu dîner en 1h et rapidement retourner au bureau."}
{"text":"Endroit très fréquenté durant la pause de midi il vaut mieux arriver de bonne heure, néanmoins le placement aux tables est très efficace durant l'heure de pointe.  Un concept bon marché et rapide comparativement à d'autres restos dans le coin.  La salle est grande et la nourriture est correcte et diversifiée, c'en est devenu une chaîne avec 5 établissements au Québec, ne vous attendez pas non plus à du 3 étoiles.  En ce qui concerne le tip, on fait la file, se sert sur un plateau et le repose une fois terminé donc, service non compris = tip non additionné, logique."}
{"text":"Nice place to go to for asian cuisine. I would recommend their vietnamese spring roll - it comes with a warm peanut sauce that is really great. They had a decent array of vegetarian options which is always delightful.   The service was actually great - maybe we went on a down time but I was surprised to read other reviews saying it was bad. The waitress was really friendly and gave good recommendations.   The ambience is nice, the location is charming, the food is average at best but much nicer than your typical asian cuisine joint."}
{"text":"I went here because it was on my way back to hotel and I ended up going there 3 nights in a row! The poke bowls are great! And the staff is very friendly! I would like to go there again and eat there because the place is really nice! Try Bangkok Cheesecake cause its awesome!!"}
{"text":"Cuisine asiatique pour emporter ou déguster sur place excellente pour le lunch. Le prix est un cher mais le goût est excellent! Le pad thai est à essayer! Si vous aller sur place, soyez y vers 11:30... Après c'est bien trop long! Victime de son succès?"}
{"text":"Small joint but I walked in on a Saturday night and had no problem getting a table. Serves a mixture of Asian styles, Thai, Chinese, etc. in a modern trendy setting. The wonton soup I ordered had a very good flavour. The Stir fry wasn't anything mind blowing but was flavorful and a decent size. Wait staff were friendly. I'm sure you could find more authentic specific Asian cuisine, but the location was good right on Place des Arts and the food was tasty and ambiance pretty good ."}
{"text":"This place is not 'real' Asian cuisine but I guess that's obvious once you see whose cooking. It's more like fusion hippified old Montreal version of Asian food. I've had the pad Thai here, my reaction is- meh. It's really heavy on the pad Thai sauce. I've also had the general tao poutine which I was so excited about because I love poutine and general tao is sometimes a guilty pleasure but the execution failed. The fries were not up to par. They were stingy on the cheese. The general tao was also wanting. However, I did come here once with a friend and they ordered a salmon salad that looked awesome. Full of quality veggies and a big piece of salmon. My friend says it was good. I might give that one a go next time. Prices are good by old Montreal standards. I imagine that's partly why they're so busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Lumière tamisée et d'excellent cocktails. L'accueil à ete excellent et l'exotisme du menu donne l'appétit. Qualité standard mais l'alchimie de l'ensemble fait passer une bonne soirée. Le concept est bon et pour avoir tenté une expérience dans le sesame de sainte Catherine, Ma préférence reste de loin dans celui de St Jacques. bon app ;)"}
{"text":"What a terrible experience! First the cashier was in a rush for her lunch,then hey mixed up our order. And when the manager (Gerard) found out that it's been a mistake he blamed us of not letting them know, he grabbed my husband's dish and literally throw his first order on the table.the food was awful,the salmon tasted their refrigerator and it was dry. Very very expensive.the imperial roll was too greasy and full of potato !!! Very heavy. ..that was our first and last time there. Worst service and food I 've ever had.i wish we could try Thaii express instead that would be much better."}
{"text":"Das Abendessen war okay (Pad Thai Menü mit Frühlingsrollen, Dessert und Kaffee), solide drei Sterne. Da die Bedienung zudem aufmerksam und freundlich war und die Preis-Leistung stimmte (grosse Hauptgangportion), sind vier Sterne angemessen."}
{"text":"J'ai passé un bon moment ici, belle deco , assez spacieux, bon service. Comme dessert il y a un genre de creme glacé frite que j'ai oublié le nom , cochon mmmm"}
