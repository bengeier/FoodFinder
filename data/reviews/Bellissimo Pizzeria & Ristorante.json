{"text":"This place isn't fancy, by any stretch. But if you're looking for a local neighborhood restaurant that's affordable, look no further. They have a good selection of decent Italian food, and cheap pitchers of beer. 

Their take-away special can't be beat - $9 tax in for a medium 3-topping pizza."}
{"text":"Used to like this local place, but went to cash in our \"Free\" medium pizza after 10 orders, only to be told that it includes only 1 item - NOTHING on the stubs collected. What a rip! Gotta find something else!  For extra $5-6, you lost a customer that had been there over 20 times!"}
{"text":"Disappointed every time. 

Food is really not good at all I am disappointed every time I try this place. I really want to like this place but I am let down every time because the food is just terrible. The atmosphere is old and tacky and the servers seem really rude."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the neighborhood - always consistent, tasty, full of toppings and fast! Local delivery is free. I wouldn't go anywhere else for a  take-out pizza! Forget pizza-pizza, pizza hut and all the other big names - Bellissimo beats them on all levels!"}
{"text":"The complaints some have about service are partially why I like this place. It's a no nonsense type of place. The pizza is great. Get a side of the BBQ sauce to put on it, it has a really nice spice. The mediums that I've had delivered honestly seem like larges. And yeah the walk in deals are good I thinks it's a medium 3 topping for $7 and a large for $10 they also don't charge delivery so I happily tip. The pizza it's true may not be 'the best' but to me it's just right, especially cold it's tasty. Haven't tried anything other than the pizza."}
{"text":"This is truly a neighbourhood pizza place. The pizza is cheap & good, the booze is cheap and the service is quick. Since this is a neighbourhood place, there is never a dull moment. We have seen many things at this place that have spurred many funny party stories. 

They also have a covered patio at the front of the restaurant. I'm giving them 3 stars because their washroom is gross. 

**They have a cheap pizza takeaway deal AND if you save 10 receipts, they give you a free pizza. **"}
{"text":"The service leaves a lot to be desired. The people who work here are rude and very combative if there's any misunderstanding. The only employees that provide good service are the delivery guys...aside from that, I would avoid this place by all means. Not to mention, the food is subpar and their main offerings are unhealthy and greasy."}
{"text":"Delicious food but EVERY single time I call for delivery, my boyfriend has to call back because the woman on the phone will  hang up before you finish your order, or before you can give your address. 
Horrible phone customer service. The woman on the phone is so abominably rude and disrespectful. Literally there is no way this woman isn't related in some way to the owner of Bellissimo's because there is NO WAY in hell that this woman could ever get an actual job.... Ever. 
BELLISSIMO'S YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO YOUR CUSTOMERS. The fact that there are several reviews about this specific person and nothing has been done about it is disgusting. Clearly, they have lost many customers over this issue and its something that needs to be addressed immediately."}
{"text":"Pizza with the soul sucked out of it.
I feel a little mean saying that, but if you are looking for something volume that will fill you up and for a cheap price, THIS IS THE PLACE. Two stars instead of one for the price and the friendly delivery driver, free delivery. 

But even a cheapie like me wouldn't order from here again. Tasteless sauce and cheese, the texture is great though. Adding salt wasn't enough to make this pizza unfortunately. 
Trust me when I say you can pass on this one and might have better luck at pizza pizza."}
{"text":"What a jewel in my Neighbourhood. In the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, we have a lot of dining choices, but this place deserves a special mention. First, no white tablecloths or Jazz Bands, just your bare-to-the-bones local joint, where just about anyone in the hood can afford to eat and it seems that everyone does. The Pizza is superb from every aspect. The crust is crunchy and toppings are fresh. The pasta dishes are comparable to Casa De Giorgio Restaurants, but much more affordable. It helps that the owner at one time was a cook at Casa D G. 
If you come by car, use a parking lot as the ticket guys are trying out for the ticket Olympics in this neighbourhood, or so it seems."}
{"text":"Cute little pizza place downtown that's a refreshing change from the more common chain restaurants and fancy dining options.  

While you shouldn't come here expecting a great aesthetic experience, do expect a very decent pizza with a variety of toppings available and large pizza sizes (even the mini portion made a sufficient dinner).

We're glad we stopped in and tried it.  There is also a nice seating area outside if that's what you prefer."}
{"text":"I live around the corner and love pizza, so naturally I had to try this place out. The pizza is on the inexpensive side and the environment is great (mostly families, teens, the elderly). Pitchers of beer will run you about $12. 

They don't have a wide array of toppings (don't look for goat cheese or artichoke here!), but what they do have is fresh and delicious. I recommend the sausage & pineapple. They bring out the pizzas on silver stands, which is a great touch.

Don't bother exploring the rest of the menu, though. The garlic bread sucks. I mean, it's laughably bad. And the pasta dishes aren't great either. So stick with the pizza! It's good.

The service is lax, but you're not here for fine dining anyway. It's a casual, neighbourhood joint and it's not trying to be anything more than that."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant located very close to downtown Toronto. The restaurant has a real 'neighbourhood' feel to it. 

I ordered their pizza and was not disappointed. The crust was the perfect thickness and remained crispy even with the topping I chose. The dough they used had a hint of sweetness to it and the ingredients they used were fresh. They have take-out specials, so watch for them. 

Like Arnold used to say,\"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"When I lived in the neighbourhood, I got lots of take out from this place, pretty good, nothing outstanding - but convenient and priced fairly.

There used to be a waitress who looked like a persian female David Lee Roth.... all the \"regulars\" at the bar loved her. It was funny watching the drunks try and pick her up."}
{"text":"Went to the store July 15th 2017 at 9:20. I had the worst customer service from a short female server the absolute worst experience I've ever had from there. I went in looking to get take out. I was debating whether I should get a poutine or chicken wings (half a dozen) so I just asked how big the chicken wings were because I've never had wings just pizza from that place. She seemed very annoyed to stop texting and get off her cell to answer me. She replied \"I don't know they're chicken wings\" she than walked off around the pillar to the bar and started complaining to her co worker and other customers. \"Some idiot just asked how big the chicken wings are, wtf they're chicken wings how the f**k am I supposed to know, they're f**king chicken wings\". I than confronted her about her complaining about my simple question. I told her she didn't have to be rude and complain about such a simple question or to even swear about it. All I got back was \"wtvr sorry\". It even looked as if the manager on duty witnessed what happened and did not say anything to his hostess. I work in customer service in food and beverage, by far that is one of the worst experience I've had or read about in email complaints at work about customer experience. Not only was there bad service in front of a manager, there were also numerous food safety violations, cases of can pop and food products directly on the floor not 6 inches off the floor beside the sink, staff eating in the kitchen of top of food prep table and grill. All this visible at the first point of interaction. Clearly they need to have a random food safety audit to see if they're complying food safety regulations."}
{"text":"This pizza joint came highly recommended by two coworkers of mine, so I decided to give it a whirl and ordered it for delivery.

Toppings were copious and cheese was plentiful but the pizza was very soggy and the toppings fell off in large chunks. The closest comparison would be a grocery store made pizza which you have to take home and bake yourself. The pizza crust was thick like texas toast and the sauce was absent of flavour.

My coworker demanded I give it a second try, so he brought left over pizza to the office. I warmed up my slice in the toaster oven and chowed down. The pizza was less soggy this time but I felt like it was inferior to frozen pizza. 

Don't think I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service. Just called to order a pizza and the wicked witch that answered the phone was beyond rude. The level of attitude, disrespect, and rudeness was... just wow, she was so condescending. I told her I would not be ordering from there and she very mockingly said \"take care\" and hung up on me!!

Very disappointed as this place was \"highly recommended\" by a colleague. 

1 star only because there's no option to give 0. 

Never again."}
{"text":"We ordered $100+ of pizza and wings from here for delivery.  From what I can remember, I think it came pretty fast and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  Granted, we were drinking quite a bit so any food would've probably been good but I distinctively remember the wings being amazing.  Would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"great nothing fancy just come as you are great place.. I really like their pizza. I have to wounder about what they call Greek salad... since when does Greek salad have lettuce in it?? and their lasagna tastes a bit like ravioli out of the can.. but still great pizza and cheap beer, cant go wrong."}
{"text":"This review is negative because whomever the girl/lady on the phone i ordered from was ridiculously rude. Like come on, you want return customers why don't you show some politeness on the phone. Seriously need to reassess who you put on the phone tonight, that girl has horrible customer service skills ... just wow."}
{"text":"Fought traffic for a hour leaving the Toronto FC Game on a empty gas tank  in order to come and eat at this establishment....the service was absolutely horrible.  One lady doing the bartending and waiting of the tables.  Almost choked of thirst on numerous occasions.  The food we ordered tasted like a$$ and smelled like my knee pad and batting gloves Chalk up another one in the bouts column ... THIS PLACE IS FOR THE BOUTS... I won't be coming here again"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for YEARS. I used to come here all the time for lunch when I was in elementary school, so I am used to the attitude from the employees at times but overall they can be nice especially if you are a regular. We used to order the poutine all
the time at lunch, it's decent and it went along way especially when you are given only 5 bucks a day for lunch money. Anyway I'm all grown up now! and I just wish that they would evenly distribute the gravy so that it evenly flows to the bottom of the container because their poutine tends to be dry as you get to the bottom. Also, I love their fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp, spaghetti with meat sauce, chicken salad and chicken wings with their suicide sauce. Their pizza is not bad but I don't think it's the greatest. I would rather go to pizza Nova down the street (which I've been going to for years also). Unfortunately over the years I must admit , the quality of the food has gone down hill,because it's not as tasty and well prepared as it used to be, the new cooks that they have, don't execute the dishes as nicely as it has been in the past. Also, another thing that has stopped me from coming here is that as I got older, I realized this place does not have the highest standards in terms of cleanliness.  One day a couple years ago, I witnessed the owner leave the waiting area to go back to the kitchen to prepare someone's order for take out. But he did NOT wash his hands upon returning to the kitchen. I could be wrong, but it's my understanding that if you leave the area where food is being prepared and you return, you need to wash your hands before you touch anything!!!. Also, one day the bartender/waitress/cashier used her bare hands to grab the bread that comes with my order. Seriously! After you just handled money!! So be careful when you get your bread, watch her carefully. Also, they are in serious need of renovation!! The place looks very outdated and not in a charming way."}
{"text":"Our pizza showed up quickly and was delicious. The crust was flaky and the cheese was perfectly stringy! It was also super affordable - 23 bucks all in for a large with delivery.

Our pizza delivery man, Jim, was also an excellent sport and was pretty stoked on our holiday cheer (see attached photo). All in all, terrific experience."}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place many times, and they are very consistent, I only ever order the pizza but its always cooked perfectly (I order well done) and the toppings are generous and the mozzarella is fresh and chewy, I love it. The best part about this place is they have really fairly priced food and delivery, $15 for a medium 8 slice with 3 toppings, delivered! 

I mean sure there is probably better pizza out there, cooked in a wood oven imported from Italy, but lets face it, those pizza's, as delicious as they are, are always tiny and usually run you about $17+ for a dinner plate sized pizza. Bellissimo's has very good pizza, as well as great service with a very funny and friendly delivery guy. I love ordering from this place and would do it again and again. 

For those of you with soggy pizza complaints, try ordering well done, and maybe don't overwhelm the pizza with tons of watery veggies, as I've honestly never had a soggy pizza from them in the many years I've been patronizing this place."}
{"text":"Favourite local pizza delivery! Pick up specials are great and we also really like the wings! Collect 10 receipts and get a free pizza ;)"}
{"text":"Yummy, awesome and, uh, yummy. Friendly service, tons of choice, and delicious pizza. I can also recommend the burgers and poutine. Thumbs up for the fries. One star off because the food isn't orgasmically outstanding, but is fantastic for the price and convenience. Busy but cosy place located just a short distance from St Lawrence Market, but frequented mostly by locals. Seven thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Terrible phone demeanour from staff! I ordered food for delivery for the first time and the lady on the phone was very standoffish. She definitely had a negative attitude, it felt like she didn't want us to order food in the first place. Whoever was working the phones on Sunday evening February 11th should be reprimanded or be provided extra training in customer service."}
{"text":"I recently moved to this area and I really wanted to love this place.  It is a neighbourhood spot but it is just so sad that I don't think I will be coming back to this place.  I had the vegetarian pizza, which was passable and my boyfriend had the chicken cacciatore, which was delicious except he unfortunately almost swallowed a fantastically long hair that was on his food.  After that we were just not so hungry anymore.  We are not finicky people by any stretch but after an experience as that, it is just very hard to find love or appetite for your food.  This may have been an exception but I work hard for my money and I think I should spend it on establishments that make me feel good after a meal and not queasy and guilty.  If you ever go tot his place, I wish you luck that you will have a better meal experience than I did.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Great tasting, authentic pizza and pasta are the trademark of Bellissimo Pizzeria.  Popular with many corporate clients (especially for large group orders during lunch), the pizza here is great and has a rich authentic taste unlike Domino's or Pizza Hut.  Price is higher than what you'll pay at one of these chains, but the food is worth it.  Pasta is great and so are the salads (advise them not to drown your food in dressing beforehand). Delivery is free for orders $10 up, but be aware that driver in the past is a bit lazy and won't help you transport large orders into a building as he is in a rush to deliver his next pizza and receive another tip.  I have had the minor inconvenience in the past and that was the only minor thing wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I met some friends here for lunch this week and was pleasantly surprised. I had no idea this place even existed but I had heard that their pizza was pretty good so I opted for a mini 2 topping and I wasn't disappointed! The crust had just enough crunch and the cheese was perfectly gooey. 

The place itself isn't too big, but the waitstaff is more than accommodating and I had no problem wheeling my stroller in or even changing the baby out in the open. 

Also - kudos for record speed of your food out of the kitchen. I'm not sure if that is exactly a good thing, but when you're visiting co-workers who only have an hour to spare it was appreciated!"}
{"text":"I live across the street from this place and I've dined-in once and ordered take-out a few times. I went today for the chicken souvlaki dinner because I just didn't feel like cooking. It comes with rice, potatoes, salad and tazitki. It comes up to around $12.50 and the portion size was good. 

Chicken: white meat was nicely charged, but slightly overcooked

Rice and potatoes: cooked well, but nothing to write home about

Salad: ice berg lettuce, tomatoes, onion, green peppers, olives, feta and WAY TOO MUCH dressing - ask for it on the side.

Tazitki: good thick consistency and pretty mild on the garlic

It's not my go-to place, but I'm sure I'll be ordering from them again.

Side note: I was surprised that the dining room was 3/4 full on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Close to being the ONLY take out that most resembles frozen grocery store pizza.
This joint is first and foremost a SPORTS bar. Pizza is an singular disaster.
Choke Choke Choke
Absolute crap is being kind!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering from this place for years - the pizza is good, but the pastas are mediocre and expensive for what you get.  The reason for the poor review is that our past few phone orders have been taken by a really obnoxious person who sounds annoyed that we were calling and giving her more work.  When they are busy, the delivery time can be over an hour and the food arrives cold.  We dared to call back to ask for a status update after an hour and again, the rudeness was unbearable.  There are other pizza places that won't make you feel like you are bothering them so will be going somewhere else from now on."}
{"text":"THE PIZZA is better ELSEWHERE. SERVICE IS AWFUL.

I this place was highly recommended by one of my boyfriend's coworkers as being the best pizza in downtown. So naturally we were excited that we lived so close by.  We decided to order in since they offer free delivery. What a BIG MISTAKE.

After being called back by the restaurant to give my address for the second time I went further and stated the name of the building to help out. 

I get a second call from an angry delivery guy who is lost and at the wrong building. He continued to yell at me and accuse me of giving the wrong address to my own place. BS! 

To boot the pizza leaves something to be desired. I rather go to Pizza Pizza."}
{"text":"best value pizza anywhere! Medium size with 3 ingredients and authentic real pizza taste less than $11.00!! It should be top of the Yelp list."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a late dinner with some friends on our way home. 

I got the poutine and the cannelloni. I'll never say that thin cut fries are ever the best for a poutine, adding in the fact that it was a bit too salty for my tastes (although I personal avoid adding salt where possible, so this is probably different for those who have more salt that I do on average), it wasn't the greatest I've ever had. This was the first time I've ever had cannelloni and despite the the overdone ends I thought the majority of it tasted really great. 

Everyone else seemed to think the food was alright overall but nothing amazing.

There isn't too much to say about the service, it was decent, they had some trouble with splitting the bill even when we all explained what should go to each individual."}
{"text":"So I ordered banquet burger with Mediterranean fries as a combo as it's my regular order... but this time whoever made it put all the toppings on the bottom and got really soggy by the time I opened the container.

They give you a good amount of fries, and I'm pretty happy with the amount of feta and sauce they use. The burger is also good.
I'm pretty satisfied with the combo for the price 
I usually don't dine in, prefer take home and eat.. one tip- call ahead and order for pickup they are pretty fast in getting your order.

Also save your reciept that they staple on the paper bag, once you have 10 you can get a free medium pizza!"}
{"text":"When I moved into the area I immediately tried to stake out a good local go-to pizza place. Bellissimo's fits the bill! It's better quality pizza than chains like Pizza Pizza or Pizza Nova. The crust (which is arguably the most important component of a good pizza) is crunchy and satisfying so you don't need those disgusting mayo-laden dipping sauces to make it palatable!  

If you are ordering your pizza to go I highly suggest taking advantage of their pick-up specials. You can get a medium 3 topping pizza for 9 dollars (tax included!). They also deliver, but I haven't ever used their delivery service due to the close proximity."}
{"text":"Holy Hell. Just called to order delivery and got total attitude from the gargoyle answering the phone! You know who you are, we asked for delivery, not take-out and you can take your \"whatever\" and shove it down your miserable little throat...terrible customer service - I hope your boss reads this. Too bad because I'm new in the area and was looking for something against the grain but you totally ruined any chance in hell of me ever ordering anything at your little establishment...seriously, quit and find something that erases the a-hole factor in your life or become a prison guard or something..."}
{"text":"Old school pizza at its finest.  This place is the classic neighbourhood pizza joint.  A large 3 topping pizza for $11 for pickup?  The best!  Greek owned so you know it's good."}
{"text":"It's a family run place in St Lawrence neighbourhood which has a very homely feel. It seemed like everyone coming there were regularities. The management knew them by names, chatted with them. We saw a lot of people do takeaways from there and huge turnout in groups and families. To talk about food, it tasted homely. Breads served tasted well.. Pizza was crispy and good.. Lasagna was decent.. we enjoyed our evening"}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite place. We order from here almost 4 times a week.. I have never had any problems with my order. Food is always hot and delicious. And delivery is so fast and the driver is always so courteous. Everything from the pizza to the soulvaki dinner to the burgers are so flavourful.. Keep up the amazing work!"}
{"text":"Go to delivery pizza spot in the area. Food comes quickly even with large orders. My friends and I always order the calabrese, Bellissimo, chicken gourmet and Mediterranean pizza. The mild and hot wings are fairly large and delicious as well. 

Expect a 30-45 min wait tops for food to come to your door step. Very pleased with our service every time we order from here"}
{"text":"I must be missing something. I read the reviews and thought it would be good. Thin crust was really soggy and the pizza had way too much cheese, and not nearly enough other toppings. I don't think I wouldn't order from here again. Pizza is cheap for a reason. Maybe the dine in option is better."}
{"text":"Great waitress. Other than that, the pizza is wretched. The restaurant reminds me of something that would be on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. The owner is extremely creepy and likes to aimlessly  wander, even though he looks like he's constantly judging and observing customers, in an intrusive manner. He also seems more concerned about selling beer than quality food.  Truthfully, 1* at best."}
{"text":"The pizza is cheap and good! I don't know why people would think its soggy. I order a pizza with Greek salad and it was under $15 with delivery. It is a nice ready made meal to pick up after work."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Good service.
Got the cheese garlic bread, it was just okay. Would go there again"}
{"text":"I've had Bellissimo delivered to a boat three times now, so I must update this review. Within 30 minutes these people can get six pizzas and three salads to a boat, piping hot and delicious without missing a beat. Pizza blessings for all."}
{"text":"Best local Italian pizza in Toronto! Their pasta is so delicious and the atmosphere of place is like your special local restaurant, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good quality pizza had a Hawaiian pizza which was cooked to perfection great service and really nice waitress there. Good place for Italian pizza."}
