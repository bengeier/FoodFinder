{"text":"This place is awesome and I can say that because I am one of the owners daughters.  My mom puts her whole heart and soul into every meal that is prepared.  My dad is a class act he loves people and they love him.  From the time you enter the door everyone becomes family to us.  I truely believe this place is one of the best kept secrets in the Pittsburgh area.  If your looking for a place with old fashioned, homemade meals that are made to order this is the place to go.  I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Upon entering the front door of T & D's Pub & Grub my mother and I were immediately greeted by a friendly gentleman named Tom. I told Tom that this was our first trip to T & D's Pub & Grub and that we were here for a fish sandwich. Tom introduced himself as the owner of T & D's and welcomed us in.  We were immediately shown to our table and seated.  My mother and I both order fish dinners. The fish dinner came with cole slaw, and your choice of french fries, vegetable or mac n' cheese.  Upon arrival of our fish dinners and to our amazement, the portion of fish atop the sandwich was one of the largest I've ever seen! Upon taking the first bite I soon realized it was one of the best tasting fish sandwiches I've ever had as well.  The mac n' cheese and french fries were also very delicious and very generous in portion size. For a price of under $10 dollars for one fish dinner, my mother and I could not of been happier with what we paid for! It's important to point out that the fish and french fries were NOT the least bit greasy. This fish sandwich was VERY well prepared!  Mid way thorough dinner, Tom, the owner, stopped by our table to ask us if everything was to our liking.  It was! It's also important to point out that our server, a young lady who Tom introduced as his grand daughter was very attentive to our need throughout our entire dinner. I'm excited to return to T & D's Pub & Grub not only for another delicious fish sandwich, but to try other menu items as well.   Thank you T & D's for a great dinner and friendly service during our trip!"}
{"text":"For real one of the best burgers...and for the price?? 4.95. Slice onion is a must. Paper thin and fresh. Hand pressed burger. 
Beer is cheap. 
This a home style place. Homemade spaghetti and meatballs on Thursdays. This has a big following. The meatballs are great as well as the meatball sub. 
They have a fried dough appetizer that is pretty decent. It's a savory and sweet taste. Has basil in the dough. 
A friend had the fish sandwich and it's a Pittsburgh style with large portion on a soft bun. Looked good. 
Not crazy about the onion rings or fries. 

The service is great here. Tom is the owner and often the bartender. Very welcoming and makes the experience enjoyable. 


Six packs to go. 

I try to choose other things on the menu but the burger is just so good!"}
