{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after seeing them in mtlblog. They seemed to be getting a lot of orders by phone for delivery or takeout the prices seemed reasonable. For example a twelve inch pizza with several toppings for fifteen dollars. Their muffins are three dollars. Not cheap but trust me they are excellent. I ordered two pizzas: the traditional with \"cheese\" and mauresque. Both pizzas were very good. The girl who served me was friendly and helpful.  There are a few negative things to say about this place. The place is too small and it can only accommodate 14 people. They are also understaffed. Orders and tasks such as clearing tables take longer than they should. The pizza dough on the traditional lacked consistency. A couple of slices had to be eaten by fork and knife because the dough was too soggy. Other slices could be eaten by hand.   I hope they can succeed and solve the problems mentioned above. They will need support and understanding from the vegan community. My rating is going to be a five but at the moment they are actually a three for the pizza, a three for the service, a two for the physical attributes ( size, layout, location ). I will be back."}
{"text":"Cute little vegan fast-food place in NDG. I've eaten there in-store and had delivery. Delivery pizza was a little slow (within their range) so factor that in when ordering. It's good pizza, and fresh and vegan - a nice option to have when frozen is usually easier to get! I loved the vegan soft serve ice cream and will stop by again."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very friendly staff! I'm not vegan, but I just keep going back because I LOVE their deluxe burger! They are the proof that vegan food can be absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I called in for delivery and confirmed I was in the delivery area. After waiting an hour and a half for my meal, I called to see wha the holdup was. I had read in previous reviews that delivery was slow so that's why I didn't call sooner. When I called they told me that I was actually outside the delivery area and they had a rush of people and were unable to call me to let me know. But they offered me a 20% discount off my next meal, which was a total insult.  They blamed this misunderstanding on a new employee and should have delivered to me anyways as it was their error. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"During a visit to Montreal a friend of mine took us to this newer location for Vegan Rapide. It wasn't super busy when we arrived because it was just after they opened at 12.  The service was amazing! Most of our table spoke very little French but our server (who also seemed to be management / potentially the owner?) was super patient with us and double checked our order to make sure everything was how we wanted it. She was really apologetic about not being able to offer gluten free pizza crust at this time (but did say she's working to get it back on the menu) and was happy to go through some gluten free options for one member of our table.   The food was also fantastic. I'm not vegan myself but their pizza was just as delicious as a non-vegan one! I managed to demolish the whole thing in one sitting and ended up very, very full. I would definitely go back and try some of their other options. Their menu definitely goes to show that eating vegan doesn't have to mean just eating salads all the time."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal here at Vegan Rapide. Food came pretty fast, and the workers were really nice! We ordered the Napoleon Pizza, and the Orbit Poutine. The pizza came out first and my boyfriend and I finished it up really quick. The cheese did not taste like vegan cheese usually does, it wasn't too heavy and I really think anyone, vegan or not, would enjoy it! Next time, I'd want to try the cheese stuffed crust, although it costs a few extra dollars. Then, the poutine came out and it looked beautiful. It had caramelized onion, seitan bits, cubed vegan cheese, and gravy on top of fries. The fries were so fresh and perfectly fried, and the gravy did not taste like any other vegan gravy I've ever tried! It was definitely the best poutine I've ever had. If you ever get the chance to eat here, GET A POUTINE! Will definitely be coming back, Thank you!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in here - grabbed lunch for me (not a vegetarian or vegan at all) and for my daughter (a vegetarian who is pretty close to being vegan). We both enjoyed our sandwiches.    They are all about $9 each and come with a side of coleslaw. Staff smiles all the time and is very friendly. The place had people coming in and out the entire time and I was there at around 3:30 pm (not a rush time at all) so I'm guessing it's really popular. I'd go back, food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Bonne nourriture, mais service laissant grandement à désirer. J'y ai mangé le meilleur sandwich végé que j'ai jamais essayé (bacon de noix de coco), mais je ne peux pas laisser 5 étoiles tant que le service ne gagne pas en rapidité, courtoisie et efficacité. Les deux fois où j'ai essayé le commerce, j'ai été surpris par la nourriture et déçu par l'accueil. Les pizzas ne sont pas à se jeter par terre, je les éviterais si j'étais vous."}
{"text":"If you want to eat something simple, quick and easy, this is your place. Don't look for fancy, flavour bursting dishes, what you get here is comfort food. I am only giving them 3-stars because with just a few more ingredients their sandwich are other dishes could be spectacular. But, you know what, simple is all you need sometimes :)"}
{"text":"This place is a blessing. I've only ever ordered the burgers and the poutines and they're both perfect. I usually don't like Daiya cheese but I don't mind it in their stuff."}
{"text":"I had high hopes but this place was a miss for me. I got a gyro and a soup. My girlfriend got the Buddha wrap and it was missing avacado. They replaced that to their credit. My soup was clearly burnt with small black specks of the pot it was cooked in floating on top. I returned that. My gyro was just seitan, runny flavorless vegan tzatziki sauce, and poor looking lettuce with old tomatoes as well. I don't get the feeling that there is much culinary thought put into the items and the produce is lacking freshness and quality. Even if the soup hadn't been burnt it was just water consistency."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious and so healthy! I am so grateful for this business! Prices are great too! I have not tried the pizza yet, but they look good."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to eat at Vegan Rapide when I visited Montréal. The food was super fresh, delicious, and the staff was warm and kind. When the time comes for me to visit again, I will definitely be back. Many thanks for making me feel at home!"}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious I crave it often. You don't have to be vegan to fall in love with this fast food joint. You just need to have taste buds. Just miam!"}
{"text":"Really good food! My recommendation: the Deluxe burger and the poutine! the desserts are unfortunately not their strong suit, however, they are very friendly.   I would love if they could lower down the music volume, and probably change the music style as well. The place need redecorating, I find the art on the walls quite disturbing and the place very depressing in general."}
{"text":"Au cas où vous en douteriez encore, Vegan Rapide prouve que la bouffe végane n'est pas que des salades. En fait, ici, c'est plutôt le contraire: il n'y a que 2 salades au menu contre 6 pizzas (la plus grande sélection végane à Montréal!), 6 burgers, 8 sandwichs et au moins 4 desserts! En été, de la crème glacée molle est également disponible. Dépendant de vos goûts et préférences, plusieurs options sont également offertes (sauces variées, croûte au fromage pour les pizzas, etc.). Notez aussi que le fromage sur la pizza est compté en extra. J'irais presque jusqu'à dire que Vegan Rapide illustre bien ce qu'est la vegan junk food mais, au final, les plats sont préparés maison (comme les boulettes de tofu des burgers), plusieurs comprennent une bonne quantité de légumes frais et il n'y pas tant d'huile ni de friture. Bref, si vous avez un craving du genre et préférez (à raison!) éviter les produits d'origine animale, Vegan Rapide aura de quoi vous satisfaire. J'aimerais quand même un menu plus étoffé: à part les pizzas et quelques burgers, les autres plats sont assez classiques. L'établissement est plus connu pour son service de livraison et, lorsqu'on pénètre dans le restaurant, on comprend pourquoi. Il n'y a que peu de places (environ une quinzaine). La décoration est sobre (peinture beige, quelques tableaux au mur). Il n'y a qu'un toilette et l'espace est partagé avec la serpillière et d'autres produits de nettoyage. En fait, Vegan Rapide n'a pas de \"charme\" particulier. Je ne vous suggère pas de vous déplacer seulement pour Vegan Rapide mais, si vous êtes dans le coin et recherchez un endroit pour une quick bite, ce n'est pas dérangeant. J'apprécie toutefois que, quand on consomme sur place, les plats soient servis avec des vrais ustensiles et assiettes. Les restaurants du genre ont tendance à favoriser le plastique et le carton pour éviter la vaisselle et gagner du temps: bravo à Vegan Rapide de limiter les déchets! Dans tous les cas, que ce soit pour une livraison ou sur place, le service global est assez lent (les tables ne sont pas nettoyées rapidement, le temps d'attente lorsqu'il y a plusieurs commandes en même temps tend à s'allonger, etc.). Planifiez en conséquence si vous voulez avoir votre bouffe à l'heure! Vegan Rapide se dit être l'\"évolution de la restauration rapide\". Même si je crois que ce n'est pas encore le cas (malheureusement!), c'est positif que Montréal profite d'une place du genre. J'espère juste un menu davantage diversifié (de nouvelles pizzas!), plus de staff à l'uvre et un peu plus d'amour apporté à la marque et au restaurant."}
{"text":"Quick, simple, & yummy. This place is for you if you're looking for a quick, cheap, vegan meal. This is NOT the place for a romantic date or a dish served  with truffle oil. Anyhow, we had the soup, cheeseburger, and Buddha sandwich. The soup was spinach mushroom, although it tasted more like a spinach juice. A bit too oily, but overall hearty and tasty. The cheeseburger was amazing. So good. Like a real burger but much better. The Buddha sandwich was good, although just a basic seitan, avocado, lettuce, tomato, etc sandwich. The portions are small however; one sandwich is like one pita pocket served with a half cup of cole slaw. Relatively cheap too at only about $10 CAD. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"With vegan pizza, burgers, and even soft serve ice cream, there is so much to love about this place. It was crazy hot in there, but this small restaurant is a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan food!  Buddha sandwich is my all time favorite, and all their pizzas are delicious. Everything tastes very fresh and the waitstaff are friendly.  If you're a vegan, or if you just like delicious healthy food, this place is a godsend."}
