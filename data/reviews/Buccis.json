{"text":"I recently went to Bucci's Restuarant for the first time hoping to have a great experience. We were celebrating mothers day and I just wanted a good meal. Unfortunately I did not have one. I ordered the salmon which was a whopping $21. It came out so overcooked it looked like orange painted chicken. Our server never checked back to see how everything tasted so i slid the salmon off of my plate to try and get her attention. When she came over she finally took notice, a bit too late everyone else was finishing up, I explained to her the salmon was super well done and if possible would like a piece cooked medium. When the new salmon came out it was still cooked well done but not as crispy. A manager never came to the table! I was starving so I ate as much as I could. One reason we picked this place was because it was listed as kid friendly, however, I had to ask for crayons, get someones attention for a booster seat, and never was given a childrens menu. The few questions I did ask the server she couldn't answer and never asked a manager to get me an answer. Our server wasn't very friendly and never smiled. Dont waste your money!!"}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland on business. My local rep took me to this very quaint Italian restaurant. We sat in the bar area as it appeared the main dining room was closed. Either that or it was not their dining room. 

The restaurant had an older vibe to it in that the furniture was dated. But it was a comfortable feeling. We sat down immediately and the wait staff wasted no time in welcoming us and taking our drink orders. Drinks were well prepared but a little expensive. I had a grey goose martini and it was $8.50. 

The menu had a variety of options but was not very large, just two pages. I had the strawberry salad and the gnocchi. Both were prepared well and met my expectations. The sauce on the gnocchi was excellent, not too sweet, more on the zesty side.

Diner and drinks for two was $63, not a bad deal considering the portion sizes were large. I ordered a half size of the salad and still did not eat it all. the gnocchi was good but again so large I could not eat it all.

All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Place was stuffy and felt like I walked into grandma's house.  Probably great for an older crowd.  Food was average.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Seems it's trending down from my last review sorry to say if your staying at the hotel and you don't want to drive a few miles then maybe. :-("}
{"text":"This is the place you have your parents take you when they come to town as a B-W student. It is also a popular place to have a nice graduation lunch. The food is tastey and there is a classy feel to the place. 

My graduation lunch was here, and the spotlight was quickly stolen as it turned into my sister's engagement lunch. 

weeeeeep wommmmmmmmmmmmmp."}
{"text":"Staff is nice. I had the soup/salad combo topped with salmon, and the lobster bisque. I wasn't impressed. The salmon was burned so they comped it and I didnt eat it. The lobster bisque was on the sweet side which I didn't care for."}
{"text":"Both the food and service were good.  I had the lasagna based on one of
the yelpers.  He was right!!  Deee-licious.

Wrong time for me to be on a no-beef diet :-)  Everything was great.  Had extra
to take home.

Wine was kinda expensive at $6 a glass."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this hotel restaurant. The food was incredible. I had the ziti with meat sauce and added meatballs and Italian sausage. A perfect end to my long day."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of hosting my son's wedding reception dinner recently. I shopped around at quite a few restaurants and found most party menus to be unimaginative and over priced. A friend of mine who is well versed in good food, gave a strong recommendation to try Bucci's in Berea.

I have to admit I was a bit reluctant at first glance because the decor, while clean, comfortable and attractive, needs some updating. The party room seemed a tad on the small side, but was comfortable and large enough to handle the party of 40 that I had planned. 

The party menu looked great and was reasonably priced. I was concerned about food quality because I wanted a buffet style service to keep costs down, but find most buffet served foods to be very rubbery and bland. The party planners were very helpful in selecting menu items and assured me that the food would be delicious, pointing out that everything served from the buffet menu was fresh, cooked to order, and that it was the same recipes from their restaurant menu.

I could not have been more delighted with the results. 

The food was delicious. The Chicken Marsala was absolutely the best I have had, and I assure you I have had plenty. The roasted sirlion was cooked perfectly, very moist and tender...almost melt in your mouth. The green beans agli e olio were delicious and tender (not rubbery like most buffet green beans), and the rigatoni marinara was a very good. Somehow they managed to keep the pasta al dente in spite of the buffet service, which was impressive to me. And the homemade garlic butter for the fresh bread, was to die for...truly worth the price of admission. The deserts were a little on the skimpy side, but very yummy. 

Why a couple other reviewers commented that the food is good or solid, but not great is beyond me. I travel on business all over the country and when I look for a restaurant, I invariably wind up at an Italian one, so I have eaten at a lot of them. While I don't consider myself to be some foodie-snob, I do know what tastes good and what does not. I can tell you that Bucci's is some of the best tasting Italian comfort food I have had, and reasonably priced to boot.

My guests are still talking about the delicious foods there. In fact, the bride told me that she wished the food at her reception (at another location) was half as good as Bucci's. I will definitely be coming back again for dinners in the future, as I am now a fan."}
{"text":"So we were in Cleveland for a family get together.  We decided to stay at the Courtyard by Marriott across the street. Being bored and searching for happy hour, I found Bucci's and decided to walk over for a beer.  What I found was half price drinks, and good selection of beers at that, especially for a hotel bar.  Put it this way, the Courtyard bar was terrible and extremely over priced.  Anyway, we were supposed to have dinner that night at the Olive Garden, but upon arriving there was a fairly long wait.  We decides to return to Bucci's and try it out.  It was an excellent choice.  I had the chicken parm, my wife and her sister both had a shrimp dish.  Both were very good and the service was friendly and attentive.  We had chocolate ice cream and cheesecake for dessert.  I would definitely recommend this place.  Skip the chain restaurant around the corner."}
{"text":"Excellent menu options, great service, romantic lighting, huge portions, and all around great atmosphere. It is a little pricey but worth it. I used to take nice dates there to impress them lol. It is perfect for a romantic diner. I usually get Chicken Marsala and it is amazing, plus you get two full chicken breasts! One of the better Italian places i have been to!"}
{"text":"Sausage stuffed peppers were great. Large portions. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last week to take advantage of the happy hour bar specials.  Drinks and food were solid, but not great.  We have eaten here before and enjoyed ourselves, and there was nothing off-putting whatsoever on this visit.  I will say the regular dinner menu is pricy for standard Italian fare, however."}
{"text":"Not exactly the most modern restaurant.. ok so it's probably the least modern.. but it's freaking delish!  

I've been going to Bucci's for about a  year now since I was turned onto it by my significant other.. We've gone a few times, one with other people a few, and have NEVER had a bad dish.  

The dishes we have are usually some type of Pasta (ravoli, lasgna, chicken parm) and a delicious cut of steak.  I'm not really the steak eater, so I can't comment but he never complains.  I always love my pasta, the sauce is delicious, the bread is yummy (that garlic butter is life changing), and the service is attentive.  

The only negative's we have are the somewhat lacking options for the bar (we've got some specific vodkas we like that they don't stock), and sadly I wish it were more updated."}
{"text":"We went for lunch, so we don't know what dinner is like yet.

The food was very enjoyable, the service was prompt and friendly. The menu lacks child-friendly selections (one of our boys wants Macaroni and Cheese everywhere!), but the kids were still satisfied with what they ended up getting... though, it was expensive feeding the boys (ages 5 & 8) from an adult-priced menu.

I agree with Laurie A.'s assessment that the food is more comfort food than gourmet, but that is exactly what our family prefers!"}
{"text":"Another diamond in the rough amongst the not so great cusine of the Cleveland area. We enjoyed the atmosphere, fast & friendly service, and exquisite Italian food. I am full blooded Italian from a very traditional family who has secret passed down recipies of their own. So I KNOW good Italian when I taste it. After being not so impressed with a few tries of the overpriced \"commercial\" Italian food now served in Little Italy I decided to give it one more shot here and we finally found a winner.

I literally cannot stop ordering the lasagna here. It's better than my moms and that's saying quite a bit! Every time I walk in the door with the intention of trying something else on the menu... then I smell the lasagna or see someone else ordering it and that's all she wrote.

A few negatives for example the deserts are a tad on the small side and are very unremarkable despite having a variety of them to choose from. Also the very first time we went there the waitress spilled an entire glass of ice cold water directly on my crotch. NOT ENOUGH to prevent me from enjoying that world class lasagna though! A++"}
{"text":"For the price - I'll take it.

For my quick overnight purposes, I was pleased to find it was clean, they offered free wifi (although super slow), and it was incredibly easy to get to and from given its location to the freeway. You could tell this hotel has been around the block though: It's ceilings were starting to crumble! You have yourself a suitable place to stay considering the price. As long as you don't go on assuming it's the downtown Hilton, you'll be in good shape."}
{"text":"I won't go back. The dinner salad was so drenched in commercial dressing that I couldn't eat it and I had a difficult time finding the eggplant in my eggplant parmigiana dinner. There was too much cheese and sauce and the whole thing was greasy. The side dish of pasta was so undercooked that it was inedible. My dining companion enjoyed his angel hair with shrimp but only the shrimp. The angel hair was over cooked. So there you have it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this restaurant and support a local place but why bother. If you want caprese salad you can only have it a happy hour. Instead of trying to please a customer and accommodating me they argued and said bruschetta was just as good. Caprese salad and bruschetta are two different things. Save the trouble and go to Bucca Di Beppo or Olive Garden and get what you want when you want it. I'm irritated by the fact they were so willing to accommodate me."}
{"text":"Good Eye-talian comfort food in cute downtown Berea. Pasta and entrees are pretty standard: you'll find gnocchi, spaghetti, cavatelli, and some assorted meat and fish dishes, all solid. Portions are huge- bring a suitcase for your leftovers. Ambiance is dark and cozy and felt nice on a cold winter night."}
{"text":"i only had the complimentary breakfast here so the only review i can give is for the breakfast. The staff was super friendly and attentive, food was decent, that about it"}
{"text":"I recently was housesitting for a friend in Berea. I have been to the Bucci's on Hilliard in Rocky River a few times and the pizza shop in Middleburg. I trust the Bucci family recipes. Before my friend and his wife left for California, they took me to dinner at Bucci's in Berea. The complimentary bread and garlic herb butter is good. I ordered the chicken parm and it had two big breasts of chcken. They were cooked to perfection. It is the best chicken parm in Cleveland, in my humble estimation. The sauce here is terrific, and reminds me of my Tancredi family recipe (slightly altered by my mother). My friend ordered the gnocchi and I can't remember what his wife had! Everyone enjoyed their meals very much. My father came into town for Christmas and on his last night I took him out to Bucci's for his farewell sendoff. He usually orders veal parmesan at Italian restaurants. He said that he prefers this to the dish of the same name, but prepared at the Hilliard restaurant. In an email to me he wrote, \"Bucci's Berea...supplied the best veal parm I've had\". This restaurant is probably my favorite Italian restaurant in the Cleveland area. The service is some of the best service that I have experienced recently."}
{"text":"Buccis At The Crowne Plaza has a chef in there that belongs in San Francisco or The Gramercy Tavern.  I have not had a decent veal parmesan since Little Joe's in SF in 1977.  The sauce is real family Italien - excellent.  I count this as a real find.  Live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"I have to say that my meal, though pricey, was extremely good. They have fantastic bread and butter for the table and their menu seems to have a little something for everyone (more so during lunch).
However, there were a couple set backs. Granted, we did visit towards the end of a Saturday night.... We did not find the place in the best of shape. 

- They were out of several of the menu items ... (Which would normally be totally fine, however their dinner menu is not all that large... It did not leave us too many things for us to choose from.)
- They were out of a number of the liquors any normal bar would be fully stock with. (Bombay and good bourbon for example.)
- We were surrounded by dirty tables the entire 1.5-2 hours we were there. The same dirty tables!! They were never touched. And frankly, they were not nearly busy enough (4 tables) for the place to stay trashed our entire visit. 
- Lastly, the women's bathrooms were gross. I would say 7 of the 10 they had to offer were graphically clogged. 

Sorry guys. Good food, bad presentation...."}
