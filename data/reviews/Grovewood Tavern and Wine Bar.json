{"text":"Had a fantastic dinner at the Grovewood tavern and wine bar with my coworkers. The waitress was a little behind in keeping up with our table, however we enjoyed the abundance of this location along with the freshly made bread that was delicious. Everyone had the opportunity to try something different for dinner- I ordered the Bison brisket and it along with the other entrees were delicious. Great wine selection and deserts rounded out our evening.   I was very happy with this recommendation."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent happy hour, within walking distance from our house and the Beachland.  What more could one ask for in a wine bar and tavern?  My fiancé and I come here regularly for the happy hour and to grab a bite to eat.  We have tried almost every dish on the happy hour menu, except for the two seafood selections, and have enjoyed them all.  The duck burger sliders are delicious and well seasoned.  The grilled flatbread with arugula pesto and a fried egg is very good, too.  Our favorite happy hour dish is the spicy soba noodles.  They're extremely spicy and go well with an IPA.  They also make excellent burgers, fries, pasta, and a variety of other dishes.  After your meal you have to try the tiramisu.  It is possibly the best tiramisu I have tasted in my life.  We have never been disappointed with anything we have ordered from either the happy hour or regular menu.  The beer, wine, and booze selection is a dream.  They have a rotating selection of good beers on tap.  The variety often includes at least one IPA, a dark beer, and some sort of barleywine or strong beer.  The Grovewood has a nice range of booze and they make an excellent margarita.  The staff are friendly and attentive.  Once you have been in the Grovewood a few times they will know your name, where you like to sit, and what you like to drink.  The friendly staff and owners are knowledgable about the food, wine, and beer.  I think the staff may be the best part about the Grovewood, if not a close second behind the tiramisu.  Street parking is easy in the area for people who are coming from across town.  Also, I can't help but noticing when reading other people's reviews how much the word ghetto comes up.  If you think the Grovewood is ghetto then you better drive back out to the suburb you came in from.  The residents of North Collinwood don't need you in our neighborhood if you don't appreciate our funky, artsy hood."}
{"text":"Seems like every dish has red pepper in it. Great if you're a fan of red peppers. Sometimes the sauces are too heavy. Service is always great. Good beverage selection. Nice lil neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The specials are spectacular and the menu is original yet classic all at the same time. This restaurant may seem nondescript from the outside but on the inside it is intimate and elegant.  Ask for Rob-he is one of the best waiters in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome, creative food that is interesting without trying too hard.  Nice wine list, and good service!  comfortable, casual classy without the pretension.  the brûlée was amazing!  an experience worth repeating several times."}
{"text":"Eh. The wine list is impressive but the food was not worth the price. What they think they are is definitely too elevated for what we got. I ordered duck confi which was slightly dry, no substantial sides, and not filling at $26. It was basically two duck breasts and some salad with an orange slice. If the duck was cooked better I could justify the cost. Atmosphere was nice but overall I would just get drinks here. And even that is pushing it."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience at this hidden gem of a bar and restaurant!  We were road tripping from Boston to Chicago and staying at an AirBnB. Our host recommended this place and I am so glad she did. It's a quiet little place and the outside looks like a very cute and cozy house so could be easily mistaken for a residence. Inside was very welcoming. Essentially, I'd classify this as an amazing gourmet restaurant disguised as a friendly relaxed home. My boyfriend had the bison sandwich (our first time trying bison!) and it was delicious!  The homemade ketchup has 15 ingredients and it was superb.  I had the appetizer crepe as my main course. I'll just say that I was in Paris last summer and it tasted like something I would eat in France. Delicate white cheese sauce and ham bundled into a crepe. Great service and excellent beer and wine list as well. Would highly recommend for anyone visiting Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Cleveland but I don't live there any more. I still have family there so I go back once or twice and year. This recent visit I decided that it was time for me, my mom, and my 3 sibs to hit the town and have a nice meal together (instead of the delicious but not exactly healthy fried fish and polish boys we usually get). I was looking around for a restaurant that did fish and steak and wasn't too far away. I didn't want to go into the chichi suburbs either since you never know what kind of reception you'll get (yep, that's what I mean).   I did some Yelping and came up with this place. I didn't bother looking at reviews, just went to the website, verified the menu looked good (and it looked AWESOME), and decided that's where we would go. As soon as I told my sibs I got some funny looks. My brother, a young kid who knows \"the streets\", told me \"You don't want to go there; it's not a nice place\" as in, it's not fancy enough. He's apparently driven by it, which meant that it was along his route, which meant it was in \"the hood\". My sister told me that her friend, upon hearing of our plans, had also advised her that it was not a good place to go because it was in a bad part of town. This made me go back to Yelp because surely I had misunderstood something. However, reading the reviews below I finally got the picture.   Collinwood is the hood. It's been the hood since I was a kid in Cleveland. I didn't realize this place was in Collinwood, and in fact was less than 10 minutes from where my mom lives, which is also the hood. I'm talking dudes in white tees on the corner, boarded-up houses...the hood. So it made sense that people who know of the restaurant's location would be less than convinced that this was a good place to go for the kind of experience I was looking for. I trusted my fellow Yelpers though and told my fam to shove their assumptions: we're going!  I'm glad I stuck to it. The outside is unassuming and doesn't do anything to dispel the feeling that you're in the wrong place, but as soon as you step inside and the smells from the open kitchen (right by the front door) hit the olfactory, you know you did well.   The atmosphere was dark, intimate, cozy. I really liked the Christmas tree lights that hung around the ceiling, although they kept dimming/flickering during the night which was distracting. The tables were a little small so the 5 of us were kinda cramped at the round one at which we were seated, but we made do.   The warm bread and olive oil with roasted garlic that they serve you was delicious! They also kept it coming as my fam devoured a few servings of it. I had the beef medallions, rare. It was cooked perfectly, and was just an excellent cut of meat. Every one else got the shrimp and beef combination. They didn't say much about it but it disappeared from their plates so I'm assuming... They also served the largest pieces of broccoli I have ever seen in my life.   The drink selection was fantastic too. They had Seven Deadly Zins! I find it unfortunate that a lot of restaurants don't even have a good Zinfandel on the menu (unless it's that fake white Zin), let alone one that I actually recognize and like. As an added bonus, they also had Magic Hat #9! This is a delicious beer that I thought you could only find in New England and man, if I hadn't been driving I would have kicked back a number of those in addition to my wine.   We didn't have time for dessert so I can't comment on that. I do know that the next time I'm in Cleveland I will definitely be making a stop here. I've found a gem that's not far from my mom's home. And I had no idea that they'd been there for so long! I think a sign I saw said 13 years? WTH?"}
{"text":"We have been dining here for many years. Never have had a bad thing to say about this place however during our last visit we noticed a change.   Apparently we were told they have a new chef  working there and although our meal was not horrible you can definitely notice a change. The bread is different. It's a sun dried tomato  bread with big chunks of dried tomatoes. Wasn't such a fan.   Secondly, their famous ahi tuna dish with sesame noodles tasted a little more spicy than usual. They also took out the shrimp chips and changed the seaweed salad which was a huge disappointment.  We also noticed the appetizer portions are a lot smaller. We ordered 2 different appetizers and they were very small plates. In the past they have served a nice size portion for apps.   Lastly, our desert was awful. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake and it was very dry.   Overall I am not only disappointed but saddened. This comfy little spot has been one of our favorite hidden gems and now I'm a little nervous to go back."}
{"text":"great restaurant! good service and one of the best steak I ever have!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the jewel of Collinwood. The menu often changes and the food is always good. The staff are always friendly and knowledgable. Great wine selection. I would definitely urge people to sit at the bar. Very cool jukebox."}
{"text":"yum yum, get in my belly!  I have to hand it to the Grovewood for being consistently wonderful every time I am here.... I think the menu, the area & the staff oozes what the Gwood is all about - relax, just chill and you'll enjoy it all.... Some people don't like the neighborhood, but I can say I have never once felt like it was an issue.  Reservations, you need them. We popped in on a Friday early evening, and it was packed. Which is awesome. We were lucky enough to get 2 bar seats - and this is a bar where it is fun to eat. We usually try to get a table in the bar anyway.  First, wine list. First rate, and really reasonable. I love the labels under the glass on the bar cuz i can just sit there and drool, or remember this or that bottle. Ordered the Kenwood Jack London - always one of my favorites.  Second, food.Grilled ceaser. YUM. Decontstructed grilled cheese, YUM. The Ohio City pasta was a goat cheese ravioli in a delectable garlic cream sauce...oh my.  We ordered a bunch of stuff and shared, and drank and rolled into a happy little food and wine coma. No complaints what so ever.... and all around us people were dropping into their own little food coma's too.  So thanks to the Grovewood for being a great staple in an underdeveloped area.  We love you!"}
{"text":"Recently,  the Mister and I had dinner with two of our two dear friends. This dinner was important for two reasons: 1.) we hadn't made a date with them in AGES; 2.) It had been way too long (almost a year!) since we had eaten at The Grovewood Tavern.   From the Website:  \"The Grovewood Tavern & Wine Bar offers an atmosphere that is clean, friendly and relaxed. Customers can socialize with friends and new acquaintances in an easy-going atmosphere while choosing from our wide selection of fine wines; domestic, imported and micro-brewed beer; and select liquors. The patrons of the Grovewood Tavern & Wine bar are a diverse and friendly bunch, who come to enjoy fine beverages, fine food, and, of course, fine company.  Our menu features \"familiar-exotic\" foods from around the world at down-to-Earth prices. We present weekly specials along with customer favorites, so you're sure to find something to please!\"  I really love the Grovewood Tavern's laid-back kitschy look. It's cozy and inviting, making you want to stay for hours (too bad we couldn't - but more on that later).  Upon being seated, each table is given a plate of freshly baked bread and garlic dipping oil - I could just stop there and be pleased - the oil is delicious ;)  Having a considerable amount of time to scan the menu (I did my research online  ), I already knew what I was going to order. Moroccan Mahi-Mahi: Grilled and served with artisinal lemon oil, with roasted spaghetti squash and lentil salad.   This was delicious - exactly what I was hoping for. The Mahi Mahi was cooked quite well and the lemon oil infused the entire fillet with mouth-watering, fresh flavor. The lentil salad was incredibly refreshing. Crisp and tangy, it did a great job of cleansing the palette. But my favorite bites were spent on the spaghetti squash! This was cooked to the perfect consistency and seasoned with something sweet (maple syrup, perhaps?) but balanced with subtle spices.  Everyone else really enjoyed their meals, as well. Great food...better company...fabulous evening!  UNTIL...  Now, let me give you a bit of context. While the Grovewood looks super laid-back and comfortable, the prices are not. The Mister and I spent more than $50 total for just two entrees (no drinks!). That being said, I don't mind splurging for a good meal and an opportunity to relax and chat with good friends. What I do mind is being PUSHED OUT.  Allow me to give you the run down. We had just finished our meals and paid the bill. The Mister was in the middle of a story and we were all having a really great conversation. Note: other patrons were doing the same -- i.e. enjoying each-other's company after finishing their meal. But they must have had an \"in\" with the manager or something, because what happened next was simply not cool. Dear Grovewood Tavern, perhaps KICKING patrons out of your restaurant isn't the best way of getting them to come back. This is simple customer service, people. I understand if we lingered for an extra 30 minutes...but it had been 5 (tops).  The \"manager\" (or bus boy with a huge ego) came to our table and said the following: \"Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed your meal. As you can see we are kind of busy and I could use the table, so....yea....\" --AWKWARD SILENCE --   Dude, are you kidding me? This has never, EVER happened to me before. I was actually a bit in shock - we all were! The thing that REALLY put me over the edge, though, was the fact that I had seen this \"manager\" making the rounds to other tables to \"welcome them\" and ask them about their meals. We were never \"welcomed,\" just \"goodbye-d.\" And we're cool people - totally approachable! Grovewood Tavern, I MIGHT give you one more chance, but if you pull these shenanigans again, I might need to add you to my Black List -- even if your food is spectacular. Because what's the point of having an amazing meal if the whole experience leaves a bitter taste in your mouth?  Moral of the story: if you go to Grovewood Tavern -- ORDER DESSERT -- because $8 is definitely worth being able to enjoy an extra few minutes of conversation with your friends."}
{"text":"Cleveland's Best!!! Entrees usually cooked one at a time and they put thought and care into each and every dish served.  Best scallops appetizer in Cleveland / their yakitori dishes are amazing / they know how to cook duck (understatement) / wisely chosen beer selection.  All of their servers know what they are talking about and they help make the experience.  Maybe I will expand on this review, but the Grovewood is an absolute must for people who enjoy intimate and casual fine dining."}
{"text":"Went here one evening for a late dinner. I got the Baby Spinach salad and the half order of the grilled cheese. The spinach salad is a decent size, it's an appetizer but I think could work if you're looking for a small dinner. The salad was very good. I liked the grilled cheese as well. I would get both again. Our waitress was very friendly and service was very good."}
{"text":"Amazing food, all dishes here are top-notch. Their scotch pairing dinners are impeccable. I had never had scotch before and was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Our waitress was hilarious and very well trained when it came to suggesting items off the menu. We got the zucchini frites as an app which were delish, I got the steak salad and my fiancé got the French dip. Both would be repeat dinner entrees for us! We were out celebrating too and the waitress overheard and brought us 2 glasses of champagne on the house....went a long way with us! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Wow!  I hate using yelp cliches like \"hidden gem\" but, in my opinion, this is what Grovewood Tavern is.  I saw a show at Beachland last night for the first time, and had never been to this particular area of Cleveland. I did a bit of research and came across this place. The menu looked great--with its share of interesting and inspired dishes as well as standard pub fare. We decided to give it a try.  The \"feel\" of this bar/restaurant kind of reminds me of Prosperity in Tremont: a bunch of regulars acting normal in a low-key, friendly environment. The dining area was actually very nice and spacious. Our waitress was great. I drooled at several menu items before deciding on a caesar salad to start, followed by the bruschetta appetizer as a \"main\" dish. They were indescribably delicious. I can't believe I'm saying that about a caesar salad. The one thing I can pinpoint about why that salad was so great is that they left half a head of romaine intact and grilled it a little. The dressing was delicious. OH, I almost forgot the bread they gave us, with olive oil/balsamic/garlic/red pepper flaked dipping sauce. That was awesome too.  The bruschetta was served in a little bowl with crostini on the side, so they wouldn't get soggy. Smart! The tomatoes (heirloom) were heavenly, and it, too, had a lot of garlic in there, which is always a plus in my book. Although it was just an appetizer, it was large, and I couldn't finish it.  My husband had the pulled bison sandwich. He loved it. The fries were also perfectly seasoned.  I was totally jealous of the fact that they host a \"beer dinner\" and a \"wine dinner\" here, where they pair a bunch of courses with beer (or wine) for an affordable price. Also, I was intrigued by this \"Christmas in July\" thing they were talking about - they apparently have extra Great Lakes Christmas Ale and possibly some others too, that they still serve.  Overall, a wonderful meal. Can't wait to come back to try dessert!"}
{"text":"Grovewood Tavern and Wine Bar: sketchy, delicious, gathering  *Shredded Bison Sandwich. 6 oz. of lean, braised bison, served with caramelized onions and cheddar cheese, accompanied by seasoned fries and herbed mayo."}
{"text":"I first stumbled upon the Grovewood while in Cleveland for business in 2008. I quickly fell in love with the ambiance. It has all of the appeal of a 100yr old building with exposed wood, and just the right amount of whimsy to make it truly enjoyable without coming off as trying too hard to be trendy or pandering to hipsters. My favorite dish is the Quack-itori, easily a (10/10). I love the seared duck, the chilled spicy noodles are fantastic and the presentation is superb. As an appetizer, you can't go wrong with the calamari or the bay scallops (9/10) The cheese cheese flight is another great way to get things started. The house bread with EVOO makes an excellent pair with the cheese selection.  I've only had the opportunity to attend one pairing dinner (wine), but it was nothing less than a \"dining experience\"."}
{"text":"The first thing you need to know is that this gem of a place is seriously not near anything else. I mean you're going to be thinking 'Ghetto', 'This can't be right' and 'Man... what were they thinking?!' But once you enter the place... none of that matter any more.   Simply put, they have abso-friggingly delicious food! Had a cheese fondue ($16) for an app... it was oh-so-good! Much better than the metling pot or any other place in the Cleveland area.  This was followed by a fresh homemade linguine and a curried butternut pasta. The linguine was divine! Absolutely light and delicious! The curried butternut squash, however, was... um... interesting. It kind of was a mix of butternut squash, thai curry and alfredo sauce, all with some lemon. The first bite was alright, but it really grew on you - I ended up cleaning the plate out!  And then, finally, for dessert, a Chocolate Lava Cake. Now, I could probably write a book on what the perfect lava cake should be, but the summary of it is as follows: Dark chocolate semi-molten interior (the lava) - needs to be decadent Light fluffy cake surrounding it at a cooler temp (if it is made correct, the different densities will mean the inside remains hotter and the outside cools up quicker). This needs to not be soggy or uber dense, yet be rich. Vanilla Icecream on top.  And by god, this place perfected it. And all this with great service to boot!  The only reason this place did not get a 5 star is I found the butternut pasta to be 'eh'.. But don't be fooled... I shall be re-visitng this place soon!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have dined at Grovewood on several occasions and we have had an awesome experience every time. The wait staff is very friendly as well as knowledgeable. The food is always terrific, I always love the Ohio City Pasta specials they offer. My fiance is a big fan of the short ribs and the \"steak and cake\". The wine selection is very large and  accommodates all price ranges. After dinner we usually head to the bar for a nightcap. We really enjoy this restaurant and always refer our own bar patrons and friends to enjoy dinner here.  It's definitely one of Cleveland's best kept secrets."}
{"text":"Food: delicious, well developed, creative, and interesting. Wine: great selection. Service: attentive and knowledgeable but not annoying. Ambiance: beautiful in the dining room, very casual in the bar area. Location: kind of creepy, but safe. I am so glad I tried this place out. I can't wait to go back again for their gourmet food that my not-so-gourmet-man is willing to try! Everything was decadent and intriguing. There were so many delicious sounding things on the menu that I am not worried I didn't get to try more... it's a \"WHEN I come back\", not at all \"IF I come back\"!!"}
{"text":"I apparently at here in 2012, so I'm not sure if this still relevant (I'm catching up on reviews).   That said, I was impressed with the wine selection apparently.  Sad to see they're closed."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a birthday and though going during Restaurant week would give us the variety we don't normally get and things would be top notch. Sadly this wasn't the case.  The duck sliders were dry on rolls that were average at best. No dressing/sauce anywhere in sight. A real disappointment. The pasta was average. The steak medallions were cooked well and very tender with great mashed potatoes! Dessert was again, average.  Now I don't mind average BUT when you are paying over $30 per person I was really hoping for more.  Parking is terrible.  Service was fantastic though!!!"}
{"text":"So I've decided I write too many negative reviews and so I should try to write a positive one for each negative review.  This is any easy choice.   The drink list is very nice, the service is always attentive, but the menu is the main event.  It seems to evolve regularly with new items and specials as well as seasonally.  My last visit we had fish tacos as an app and they were very good.  I ordered the tuna yakatori which was served with an noodle salad dish.  The fish was perfectly seared and the noodles were a nice compliment. I love this place. Yes its convenient before a show at the beachland, but I like it so well I've made the 30 min trip just to dine here."}
{"text":"I definitely enjoyed myself at Grovewood. Like others have written, it's a little gem in the middle of a residential east side urban neighborhood. (Collinwood/Euclid)  I came for a special event in the early afternoon (closed to the public) and it essentially was the brunch menu. Everything sounded and WAS delicious. I ordered the south by southwest with mushroom gravy, and it was completely satisfying. I was also eyeing my friend's scallops and grits. Definitely going for that next time - the portions were quite generous!   The drinks are well made and strong. The good morning grovewood drink was a little strong for the morning! Haha..  The servers went the extra mile to make sure we were all accommodated. It got confusing at times, but it was a large group so it was totally understandable. Hopefully they got more practice with us!   My only gripe is that the interior didn't do it for me. You could think of it as a rustic, cottage feel (outside and inside), or you could think of it as 70s wood paneled neighborhood bar (complete with stained glass hanging lamps). Food is great, but their aesthetics need an update."}
{"text":"The menu has been pared down a bit to move into a \"farm to fork\" idea. The Cheese Flight is gone, which is sad. There is still a cheese menu, but we opted for the ham and cheese flatbread. Delicious.   I got the perch sandwich and my husband got the bahn mí. We both liked the perch sandwich better. We've both had bahn mí sandwiches before and in the past they've just had more going on flavor-wise. Not bad at all, but not what we were expecting.   Of course the beer selection is great and the service is awesome too. Don't be scared about the trimmed-down menu, some of the old favorites are still there, and the execution and overall quality are still commendable."}
{"text":"One word: BRUNCH! Holy Moly the brunch is fantastic!  Lots of vegetarian/vegan options (and meat-based ones too...if you're into that sorta thing). The biscuits and wild mushroom gravy is incredible!! YUMMY!"}
{"text":"A warm and inviting place to be...  THE UP-SIDE:  No matter how many times I eat and drink at the Grovewood, it always feels like I'm in on a big secret.  The place is sorta non-descript and in a pretty, crowded, older residential area.  However, step inside and you are greeted with a cozy, warm and friendly atmosphere.  The food is good and the wine list is fantastic.  This place is a keeper.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  On certain nights the Grovewood features live music.  Avoid these nights!  The place is too small for live music and it absolutely rapes the place of it's cozy, homey charm.  THE SUM-IT-UP: If you're looking for a cool, hip, little place with a cozy sorta vibe, try the Grovewood.  ...just stay away from the live music nights."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Grovewood for several years now, usually special occasions, a few times for NYE.  On a whole, I really have nothing bad to say about the Grovewood.  A lot of people seem to complain about the neighborhood or the restaurant interior, but honestly, those are a few reasons I love the Grovewood.  It's classy food without the pretentiousness.  It's in an urban setting, and honestly, if you live in Cleveland and make the most of your time, you realize that many gems are nestled in the diverse neighborhoods that make up our city.  As for food, the steaks and seafood are fantastic.  It's become our go to stop for NYE because even though it's busy, we always get good service and get out in time to celebrate.  I highly recommend it for birthdays or any event you want something a bit nicer and low key."}
{"text":"Amazing food! A good friend and coworker has been urging... Pushing... Coercing... Blackmailing... (you get the picture) me to go here. Finally she made reservations; invited me and my significant other as well as some friends for dinner and drinks.   Suffice it to say i have a new favorite place on the east side that I will be finding many excuses to end up here for at least a drink and app if not my evening meal. I had maple-adobo pork shank with spaetzle. Slight kick and tasted a bit like breakfast with the maple glaze. Jessica had the Zinfandel short ribs (melt in your mouh and big flavor), Rachel had the \"Quackitori\" ... Their signature item ... A yakitori with Asian BBQ duck breast served with soba noodles, seaweed salad and shrimp chips. It was too good! Oops ... I went straight to dinner and skipped apps. Cheese board with smoked Gouda (really smokey), some kind of Swiss, and a moody Blue. Crab cakes that were flavorful and cooked perfectly.   The cocktail menu was full and even had some interesting specials including their own take on a moscow mule. Beer selection is good and very seasonal from a micro standpoint. The wines I had heard were very exceptional. They actually opened a bottle of vien and poured us a couple glasses ... Usually sold by the bottle in every other place I've ever seen it at.   All in all the tavern is quite the treat tucked away on a neighborhood street in Collinwood. On the pricier side but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Had not been to the Grovewood in quite a while but visited last night and hate to say that I was very disappointed.  At 7 PM on a Monday, 2 of the entrees were already un- available.  As there were very few diners in the restaurant, I say  unavailable as they could not have been \"sold out\".   Only one of us ordered soup, but that was still barley touched when our dinner entrees arrived at the table.  Our server remarked \"sorry it came out so quick\".  Rather than that useless comment, she could have kept it warm in the kitchen. My ribs were dry and tasteless.  The Mahi - Mahi better than the ribs, but nothing exceptional. If Grovewood wants to compete with the many exciting dining options that Cleveland now offers on all parts of town, they need to step up and do a much better job."}
{"text":"I brought my new boy, an out-of-towner, here last week because the Grove is one of my favorite local spots and I wanted him to check it out. We sat at the bar as we were only getting drinks before a show at the Beachland.   The bartendress was pretty damn rude. I've been here dozens and dozens of times and never have I experienced such an awful attitude from any of the staff. Quite the opposite, normally. She was rude to us right away, before we even asked for anything. She looked at us as if we were putting her out just because we walked in the door. \"I'll be with you guys when I get a minute\", she snapped. And she kept huffing and puffing as if everyone in the whole place was out to get her, getting snippy with her coworkers (which is extremely negative and just spreads bad energy everywhere, IMHO).   After we had one beer each, we decided we wanted a cocktail. My boy was sick and so he asked VERY POLITELY if one of their cider drinks could be heated up. She looked at him as if he had sprouted a second head. \"Umm... well.... I'm not sure how I would do that... I would need to find a vessel to put the cider in...\" Again, in a pretty rude tone.   *boggle*   We both thought: A VESSEL. This is a restaurant. There is glassware everywhere. Find a fucking mug and heat it up in the microwave? This is not rocket science, chick.  A fucking vessel.   If I were her, I would have done almost anything to make a customer happy. Especially in a place like this. It's not a dive. Take care of your customers. It's not like he was asking for much. And since this was his first Grovewood experience, I'm not so sure he'll want to come back. (sad face for me)   I guess she didn't want any tips that night. She did get one from us though. 25 cents."}
{"text":"You must use the door to the Left to Enter the Restaurant which wasn't clear. We ate here Fri 2/13/2015 and we both ordered the Bison pot roast. While we waited for our entree we were served fresh bread with dipping oil which was good.. The bread had good flavor, though it was too salty.  Maybe its made that way to make you buy more alcohol. Our server was good and she brought me 3 Reisling wine samples. All 3 samples went well with the fresh bread.  Our Bison pot roast was disappointing. It had way too much chilli spices and other spices that we could not taste the Bison. It was served with cornbread, vegetables and mashed potatoes.  Later that night we had the worst Heartburn of our life"}
{"text":"This is one of the best brunches my friends and I have had!! Everyone loved their food and everything was absolutely delicious!  This is definitely a hidden gem for brunch. The menu isn't huge but it is perfect due to the scrumptious offerings. I highly recommend this quaint little place. Totally worth a try!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here with a group of 20 on New Years Eve. The menu was set with a few different options for entrees etc. I shared the Calamari with the table, it was excellent! I had the 12 oz. ribeye for my meal. It was cooked perfectly medium rare (surprises me how often places mess temps. up) Everyone seemed to enjoy their food as much as I did! I've been saying for months that we need to stop back in!  My only complaint was the service was a bit slow. Yes their were 20 of us and it was New Years but we had made our reservation in advance. We should have had two servers instead of one. And we were seated in the event room upstais/nextdoor but no one seemed to be expecting us when we arrived. We weren't greeted for nearly 15 mins. But it was New years and we were all in a spirited mood no one seemed to mind too much. Had this been another night or a more significant event I would have probably been perturbed.  Overall, excellent food and experience!"}
{"text":"For being off the beaten track...the website or the area does not do Grovewood justice! This restaurant is amazing! The food delicious and wine list extremely tempting. I was finally able to experience it for myself this last fall. A group of 10 of us went for a surprise 30th...each ordering something different and each cleaning our plates!   Started with a glass of wine and the Baby Spinach Salad...delicious. Then ordered the Grovewood Chicken Sandwich. YUM! Around me and easily reachable with my fork was a sampling of the Yakatori-Japanese BBQ-over their spicy sesame noodles (already one of my favorite sides), the Pork Tenderloin and their Lasagna. All delicious.   I have since given gift certificates to friends and family who have all grown to love this little gem! Next up-is the after work happy hour mix n match menu..."}
{"text":"I've been here many, many times for brunch, dinner and happy hour and I've never had a bad meal, but last night's meal was the BEST that I've ever had at Grovewood.  I started with the seasonal salad which consisted of torn butter lettuce topped with pepitas and tossed with a shallot viniagrette.  For my entree, I chose the fried chicken and OMG was it good!   The portion was huge, 4 pieces of chicken that had been marinated and deep-fried to crispy/crunchy/juicy perfection and then drizzled with a honey/chile glaze, which was equally tasty.  The chicken was accompanied by an order of braised collard greens which were seasoned perfectly and an ample portion of mac & cheese.  The entree also featured a HUGE cheddar scallion biscuit. The mac&cheese could have been served just a bit warmer and maybe a bit creamer, but it was still tasty.  Hubby ordered the Lake Erie perch dinner with fries and housemade slaw, which he enjoyed.  The only downside was that our server was a bit rough around the edges, but other than that we left Grovewood Tavern, very full and very happy!"}
{"text":"the best meal i have had in cleveland. no joke. went for sunday brunch.  bloody geisha - really tasty if you like pickled ginger. it's a little sweeter than most bloody mary's, which is just how i like it. good morning, collinwood! - my favorite drink out of the three. oh tasty whiskey and just the right level of fruity. bloody irishman - maybe it was the horseradish, this just tasted a little odd to me Cleveland Mimosa - nice and fresh South by Southwest - the poached eggs were a little overcooked (ie the insides weren't runny) but i'm always ok with that bc i don't like a lot of runny yolk. the biscuits were delicious, as was the mushroom gravy. def wanted more gravy, like another cup full. Orange Cardamom French Toast with Ohio Maple Syrup - the bread was so light and fluffy, just a hint of the orange, overall not too sweet. with the cream and syrup it was perfect. this also came with some sort of kale and sweet potato salad that was really tasty. Breakfast Potatoes - i don't like just potatoes but the sweet potatoes were really good.  yeah, my friend and i kind of had a lot of food and drinks. our bill came out to about 30 each plus tip. for the best meal in the cleveland, i was pretty happy with that. i will be back for dinner very soon!"}
{"text":"I have been to Grovewood more times than I can count over the last four years.  The service is always excellent.  The food is always high quality, but without paying insane amounts for the dishes.  Their beer and wine menu is also excellent.  Most recently, we went there to have desert and wine after dinner.  The ice wine was excellent.  The desert, the Vanilla Creme Bruele(sp?), was probably one of the best deserves I've ever eaten.  Bravo, cannot wait till my next visit."}
{"text":"Like everyone says rough on the outside, cute and cuddly on the inside. I've been to GTW two times. The first time I loved it, the 2nd time was just eh. What changed you wonder, let me tell you.  The first time we were just chillin', having some drinks, eating delicious burgers and partaking of the amazing golden yukon fries. My friend approved of the beer on tap selection said it was \"varied and full-bodied,\" whatever that means. I hate beer. I did enjoy my white cosmo(s), a fun twist on the regular. Another friend liked the wine selection said it was \"pleasing to the palette.\" Overall it was an easy and low key experience in a fun, Christmas-lighted atmosphere.   We went back on New Year's Eve and service was eh, food was eh and we were rushed. I had the pasta bolognese with Ohio City noodles and a trifecta of meat sauce (veal, sausage and beef). Other friends tried the chicken marsala, calamari, mushroom lasagna, shrimp bisque soup, etc. My pasta was ok, but the sauce wasn't super flavorful. Didn't melt in my mouth. The mushroom lasagna was interesting, my friend who LOVES mushrooms enjoyed it. The best order was the chicken marsala. It was awesome! Juicy chicken, fluffy mashed potatoes and crispy green beans.   So what made NYE less stellar than the first visit: waited 25 minutes for our reservation, service was spotty and yet rushed, which is a tough combination to achieve. Yes it was busy, yes they were crowded, but still would have been nice to have some of the \"chill\" factor back. Then they charged us 20% gratuity to split our bill, which they did not share until after they did it. We weren't a large group (4), we would have tipped her well anyway just because it was NYE, but that took some of the fun out of it.  Everything everyone has said about the location is correct. One of our friends said he used to score drugs in this neighborhood back in the day, how far back, not sure. But it is worth a trip for an upscale dining experience on a regular day. I'm convinced NYE amps everything up for disappointment, which is why I am sticking with four stars."}
{"text":"I see lots of nice reviews but my experience was rather bad. On arrival not that busy and yet no silverware at any of the outside tables. Ordered drinks (draft beer and a mixed drink, a Take Me Away, pretty good drink). Ordered Koldunai (little mushroom perogis) and beet salad. Beet salad did not come out with other app. I had a grovewood burger (medium) and my mother in law had the same but no onion jam (medium-well), wife had the bean and kale burger and son had the kid's fried chicken. My burger come out medium-rare, mother in laws came out rare and with the jam. She sent hers back and they said they'd take it off the bill, great. I just ate mine. Burger was very tasty just not as ordered. Wife's bean and kale burger also tasty. Son decided his chicken wasn't mcnuggety enough so he had to order another burger (no fault of restaurant). I had a moscow mule which was fine once i got over the taste of the copper cup, both mixed drinks were strong, too (hooray).  Dessert: MIL had the cheesecake (which sure tasted like it had lemon cake batter in it) the wife had flourless chocolate cake which was again pretty good. Bill comes.. ding dong waitress didn't take the burger off like she said. I hate to say it but I am tired of these locally sourced places and their hipster idiot wait-staff go headhunt the wait-staff from Bravo or something. It was a friday night for pete's sake! Anyway food was great but the service F-."}
{"text":"The place...I wish you could take the employees and the food  and put them in a building that isn't in the ghetto.  Parking is a challenge; there is NO handicap parking (I'm on crutches for a broken ankle so that stuff is important to me now).  The entrance is weird to locate, there are three front doors.  But as soon as you walk in you see this small yet efficient kitchen.  Amazed at the food that they turn out from that.  It gets a little tight as the host station and the food runners occupy the same space as the customers.  Our first table I sat on a chair that had a screw sticking up thru the seat pad...ouch.  But they moved us to a back table which suited us fine.  The server was knowledgeable, and gave us ample time to order, get drinks.  He's a smoker and his cig breaks were pretty obvious from the stench that followed him back inside.  We had a bottle of wine and the cheese flight.  Great pairings!  My friend didn't care for the grilled salad.  I had the filet medallions with mashers and veg of the day (snow peas, carrots and kale sauteed).  Filet was per--fect.  Perfect.  I have dreams about this meal.  Perfectly aged, seasoned, grilled.  Mashed pots were disappointingly devoid of seasoning...needed salt, garlic, pepper.  Veg were a little oily, were sauteed in butter, would have preferred evoo.  Dessert was tiramisu...again perfect.  Had some coffee which was surprisingly good.  Now the not so good.  The place is one huge code violation and a fire inspectors dream/nightmare...the fire door in the back of the restaurant was BLOCKED by a partition.  Nobody could get out should there be a fire....which brings me to the electrical nightmare portion..the lighting is daisychained together via extension cords, electrical taped in some cases where the cords frayed.  The lights were constantly dimming and this concerned me.  The restrooms (male) were exceptionally small.  I was on crutches and getting into the restroom was almost not possible...it's that small.  Once in you get to experience one urinal and one toilet, (it's a one person restroom) and pee all over the floor.  One light on the ceiling; poorly lit with a 1960's sink and hardware. My belief is that the kitchen is in the same condition as the restrooms.    If you were in a wheelchair...forget it.  You're not getting in.  Overall, the place is full of character, awesome food and great employees...in a building that has been grandfathered of code compliance.    Next time I'll get take out."}
{"text":"The Grovewood Tavern in Cleveland's Collinwood neighborhood is, as many before me have already said, a bit of an anomaly. It's out of the way, tucked into the enclave of a post-war boomerville in one of Cleveland's older sections and it's a bit of a mystery to outsiders. I won't bore you with my attempts at pigeon-holing this local favorite. It's an eatery that defies categorization. Leave it at that.  It's hard to tell much of anything about the Grovewood from the outside. I don't know what the space was before they took over, probably another vacant blight on the city, but once you walk in you're transported to a cozy, kitschy, realm that at once a VFW lodge and a dressed down fine dining establishment. I don't know how else to describe it. Local art on the walls, a jukebox that plays everything, and I mean everything, from classic rock to Bat mitzvah classics. It's dark, there are string lights dangling and Tiffany-esque lights overhead and white tablecloths, just so you know they're not messing around. Bar up front dining area to the right.  Speaking of beer, while GT markets themselves as a wine bar that doesn't mean they've given their beer selection short shrift. They don't have a massive selection but what they do have is carefully curated and regularly rotated. On the eve of our visit they were serving several great draught beers including Jackie O's (Athens, OH) java the Stout and their bottle selection has some wonderful surprises, both domestic and imported, like Schweinsbräu Dunkel and Schlenkerla Märzen Rauchbier alongside Bell's Oberon and Heavy Seas Loose Cannon.  We selected a table in the bar area. Seemed like it felt right to be a part of the goings on up front. The kitchen's right out front so you can watch them busily creating your meal. Good entertainment. Our service was excellent. Waters were brought immediately and constantly refilled, and our server was never too far away just in case. Attentive but not overbearing.  It was the tail-end of happy hour when we arrived so we took advantage of a couple of the specials on the HH menu:  Housemade Bread: Herbed crust, chewy innards and crispy outside with roasted garlic and balsamic dipping oil. The bread was fresh, warm and delicious. The dipping oil was a bit of a letdown. It separated making it difficult for really get any of the balsamic on the bread when you dipped.  Mushroom Flatbread: The crust on this delicious morsel was both chewy and crispy, as it should be, and the earthy sautéed mushrooms and shaved parmesan loved the swim in the fried egg's yolk and porcini oil.  Empanada of the Day: Today's selection, duck confit served with a side of cheery aioli. The pair of fried dough pockets was cooked a perfect crispy golden brown, not oily, and the duck paired wonderfully with the sweetness of the cherries in the fatty aioli.   For our dinner, we decided to go rich and hearty. After all, it was barely 10F outside so it just seemed fitting.  Grovewood Tavern Salad: We both opted for this classic. The mixed greens were fresh and the candied walnuts and Gorgonzola cheese are always a welcome match. Dressed in just the right amount of white balsamic vinaigrette, it made a nice palate cleanser and entre into the mains.  Bison Pot Roast: As soon as I saw this I knew I had to have it. The lean bison was juicy, slightly gamey (in a good way)and so tender it started to fall apart as soon as it saw the fork. Delicious and filling. The gnocchi were soft and pillowy potato goodness while the root veg accompanying the dish was the lone disappointment. I expect vegetables served with pot roast to be fork tender, almost soft, these, a combination of carrots and parsnips, were still crunchy.  Zinfandel Short Ribs: You can never go wrong with short ribs braised forever in wine. This dish was near perfection. The boneless, Angus beef short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender and slightly sweet from the cranberries used in the cooking process. The whipped potatoes were velvety smooth and perfectly seasoned as were the accompanying sliced carrots and haricot vert.   Caramel Pecan Cake: Moist and warm pecan cake topped with chopped pecans, a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with sea salt caramel sauce. The cake was wonderfully light and not overly sweet and the more the ice cream melted into it the better it got. I could have eaten a tub of the caramel sauce.  We knew as soon as we left the beer dinner that marked our first visit to Grovewood Tavern that we'd be back. Their menu is full of dishes that not only look good on paper, but translate well into the real thing. Their food is well prepared and delicious, the service is excellent and the atmosphere a mix of corner bar and urban bistro. As others have mentioned, it is expensive. But expensive compared to what? Applebee's? Our meal, without tip and discount from our coupon, was nearly $100. We were happy to pay it and will be back to do it all again."}
{"text":"One of the coolest places I've ever been.  Excellant quality medium to high end menu you would not expect from the outside.  Food and desserts are outstanding.  Extensive beer and wine list.   Try the Grilled Ceasar salad with roasted garlic chips.  They use a salad shooter to make garlic slices shoot right into hot oil, making them crispy and sweet.  Romaine lettuce is grill kissed.  Amazing.  I have it every time I visit Grovewood Tavern.  One of the best jukeboxes you'll ever find.  Wood paneled walls like you're in 'That 70's Show'.  Cool, comfortable and awesome.  Interesting people.  Grovewood Tavern is really one of Cleveland's great treasures.  @Stefanie C. I am also shocked there have only been 5 reviews of Grovewood."}
{"text":"A neighborhood restaurant serving excellent food.  My old college roommate introduced me to this place a year ago and we've been back every time I'm in town since.  So far we haven't actually had an entrée, preferring instead to order several appetizers and maybe a salad to share.  The scallops, seared tuna, calamari, and special house salad are all especially memorable.  It's definitely out of the way, but worth the effort.  A wonderful and unpretentious restaurant!"}
{"text":"Oh, lovely indeed. If you didn't know it was there, you would NEVER know it was there. Tucked in a neighborhood along 90, the dark wood and warm glow are inviting, as is the lovely wine list. Accessible and easy to understand, the list has something for even the most intimidated wine novice. The beer list ain't to shabby either (even though they were out of oatmeal stout, boo). Add to that the They Might Be Giants playing overhead, Grovewood combines little old school neighborhood bar with upscale tastebuds' requests. Very much looking forward to a return."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch with friends. I drove all the way from Lorain county and wouldn't hesitate to drive out there again! The food was so good and our waitress was wonderful. It had a great atmosphere, and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to have dinner in Cleveland.  I love that this place was built right in the heart of Collinwood, and has the feeling of the old neighborhood bar I'm sure it once was.  But then you go into the wood paneled dining room with all the white lights...It just feels Cleveland-y and romantic and nice.  The food...well....it is just phenomenal.  I've always loved the pork there, my favorite meal included a pork chop with some sort of combination of apple and sage-but then there was the sauce-some sort of smokey maple syrup sauce-that was one of the best things I've ever tasted.  In any event, the pork there was amazing, not overcooked like a lot of places do.  The chorizo cheddar mashed potatoes are also almost a religious experience.  I've never had anything but an excellent meal there, their service is always good and friendly, and they have a great wine list.  This is a great spot to go to if you are going to be hitting a show at the Beachland Ballroom, but it is worth a trip to the up and coming Collinwood neighborhood just to have dinner here!  Not only is the food great, but it embodies what Cleveland is about by taking a chance on putting an upscale restaurant right in the middle of an old slightly rundown neighborhood.  I'm sure I will be enjoying many more meals here in the future."}
{"text":"The place is great. My wife and I dine here regularly. Awesome food with a wide selection of options and great beers. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Table and bar service excellent. Food tasted good, but for a brunch, portions were disappointingly small. It wasn't that we came late in the day either, where they might have run out of their brunch options."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Very good. I had been ogling the menu online for a couple days before we finally went and still had trouble picking because every description sounded amazing. I settled on the Zinfandel short ribs and they did not disappoint-  so soft and packed with flavor.  My BF got the Blackened Scallops and they were done really well too- as were his cheesy chorizo filled mashed potatoes that I swooped in on.  Our Tuna Bites appetizer was a bit underwhelming (3 small slices of mediocre tuna for $13.. meh), but the tiramisu for dessert was great. Wine selection is great too and complemented our meal perfectly.  So why the 3 stars??  When we got in, we stood at the hostess' table waiting for someone to take our names, tell us table availability, etc.  The bartender, cooks, and waitresses (3 of them) all were right there a foot or two away from us, looked at us, tried not to make eye contact, and shuffled away. Not one person managed to acknowledge our existence. For 15 minutes. After we asked to be helped 3 times. We were about to walk out when finally one of the waiters came by and mentioned they were really busy and he'd be with us soon. They made up for this with good service the rest of the time but this put a terrible start on the night.  Besides, the dining room had about 5 tables seated, and 3 waiters working- they should be able to handle that pretty easily. We didn't need to be seated right away, but at the very least they should know to ASK if customers have been helped, mention they're shortstaffed but will be there in a minute to take down a name, etc. Anything! Don't look at us and scuffle away. Poor form."}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour. $5 flatbreads and other appetizers. I'm partial to the mushroom flatbread. And I loved my pomegranate cosmopolitan. My coworkers enjoyed the gin-based Pimm's Cup."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero, I would. I was visiting from LA. They double charged my credit card for over 100 extra dollars and still haven't credited it, despite several phone call attempts. The person who answers their phone keeps telling me that he will refund it, but I have waited more than 7 weeks and spent way too much time. Clevelanders might not know better but this stuff doesn't fly in larger cities! Also, the double charge was an admitted error on their part after an entirely botched meal in the first place, for which I regret ever eating there. Luckily my credit card company is taking care of the extra charge matter. All I can do us warn others to of the poor management  here. Everyone in my party was double charged and is having to deal with a slow and not helpful manager!  Beware.  Reflects poorly on Cleveland."}
{"text":"This place is really hard to beat. It is a place where the guys from the hood can go have a beer or the couple from Chagrin Falls can meet their friends for dinner and everyone will walk away happy. First of all, their wine and beer selections are excellent!! They may not have the most but they definately have some of the best. Then there is their food. It is just plain great. There is something for anybody there and it is all good. They do a particularly good job with their meat dishes (buffalo short ribs!!) but their seafood is also really tasty. Finally, serious props to our server, James. He always makes you feel special."}
{"text":"Grovewood was picked as a pre-concert dinner spot for a big group of us, and I'm really glad, because I never would have found this little treasure on my own. Don't be deceived by the appearance of this restaurant. From the outside it says \"friendly neighborhood bar food,\" but inside you'll find a fascinating menu that is far from the usual deep-fried food meant to accompany pitchers of beer.  Instead, you will find things like bison pot roast, blackened scallops, seared tuna, cherry duck. You'll find a drink menu featuring White Cosmopolitans.   You will find yourself in a room full of folks in jeans and sweatshirts eating upscale food.  This is one of the things I love about the eating scene in Cleveland. We are blessed with so much good food here that we get it in our bars.   I had the empanadas of the day, pulled pork with apples and apple creme fraiche. Definitely not for everyone, but I thought it was delicious. My husband had the bison pot roast, which arrived with the tastiest gnocchi I've experienced. He hardly got any of them because the rest of us kept stealing them.  The service was outstanding. When we arrived our table was not only set, but water had been poured for all of us. We told the server that we were in a hurry to get the concert at the Beachland Ballroom, and he made sure that we were served quickly and efficiently. The noise level was low, making it easy to enjoy conversation at our table.  There were many other items I want to try on this menu. It's out of the way for us, but we will definitely be going back. It's a bit pricey for bar food, but reasonable for the quality of food served."}
{"text":"So I've heard about this little place before and then I saw a Groupon deal, and of course this gave me more reason to try. And spoiler alert- I was disappointed.   It's in the ghetto so lock your car doors and leave your junk in the trunk. When you walk up, you can see some guys cooking through the front window which is a nice little feature. The inside of this place makes it feel like a comfy little neighborhood joint. It's got christmas lights and cool pictures everywhere. I like the atmosphere.   Service was great. The staff are very friendly. The food, however, I found to be mediocre.   I ordered the Quackatori which was recommended by several people. The duck breast itself was good and flavorful. It comes with a side of cold peanut noodles and to be honest, it was kinda gross. It was too peanut buttery so the noodles were kind of a huge clump and all stuck together. And pasty. I was hoping it would be a little lighter, less clumpy, and well, the opposite of what it was. It sounded good on the menu. Oh well. The side of seaweed salad was refreshing. And it came with a side of shrimp chips (the kind you get when you go to a Chinese restaurant and get peking duck).   I might go back to try something else...a lot of the items sound interesting. If nothing else, would be a good place to have a beer or 2 as they have a nice little selection."}
{"text":"Like so many others, I found the Grovewood while yelping for a pre-Beachland concert meal and I'm so glad I did!    Despite my being late in making a reservation (I called at 5pm on a Friday asking for a 6:45-7 time-slot) they stated they could accommodate my request of seating for two in the bar area.  The tavern wasn't too difficult to find and we were able to easily locate parking close by on a side street.  It is a residential area others have described as 'sketchy', but I never felt unsafe.    When we arrived, we were promptly seated at a comfortable high top table in the bar section.  Service was extremely friendly and fast (really fast!)  I never felt rushed but could tell they prefer a quick turn-around due to the constant influx of customers.   We each selected a beer from their micro-brew selection, both delicious, and just had to try that pulled bison sandwich. Despite not usually being offered with sandwich orders, our waitress brought us some of their bread and olive oil, balsamic and garlic dip which was so wonderfully flavorful I think I could just make a meal of it.    Our sandwiches arrived quickly and boy were they tasty!  The bison was oh so tender, flavorful and complemented well by the garlic-butter brioche bun and homemade herbed mayo.  The fries were deliciously seasoned as other reviewers have mentioned, offset with their Bourbon BBQ.    All in all I couldn't be happier with my experience - both the food and service were just wonderful.  I'm hoping I'll find another opportunity to visit again!!"}
{"text":"I had blackened salmon with mango sauce, excellent. My wife is had chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables. Chicken was OK but not as tender or tasty as we would expect.  Some vegis hard but otherwise very good. Great mashed potatoes. Overall rather pricey and  inconsistent with some excellent dishes. Draft beer very good."}
{"text":"What a random-ass cool little place. I say \"random-ass\" because this thoroughly charming restaurant and bar sits smack-dab in the middle of a dumpy little residential neighborhood. I couldn't imagine ever coming across this place by accident; it was suggested by a first date (who later confided that she had been turned down for a job at the place weeks earlier...awkward to say the least).   ANYWAY, we ate at the bar. By the looks of the outside of the joint, I would have thought maybe all they had to eat were hot dogs and Miller High Life, but their menu selection rivaled way bigger places around town. We both got appetizers, and they were dee-lish. Normal American tasty pub fare. Good beer selection, too. As another reviewer mentioned, this would be a great place to grab dinner before a show at the Beachland Ballroom. It was near-deserted on a Tuesday night, but I hear they get crazy packed on the weekends. Funk yeah."}
{"text":"We have been going here for at least five years and have never had bad food or service. My usual is the ahi tuna or the filet - always amazing. The spicy tuna noodles are my absolute favorite. My husband always tries a new game meat and is always happy w/his choice.  It recently changed management and chefs and therefor there have been menu changes. Understandable, but yesterday was our first time since the change. There was a definite difference in service. Waitress forgot our appetizer and food service was slower than normal. Wasn't crazy about the new menu (no more filet mignon). There was a complete turnover in staff (we always saw the same waitresses/waiters in five years and they were sooo awesome).   Overall, we won't write it off our list, but sad that our favorite place is not what it used to be. Food was still good (ahi tuna and venison), but just sad to see it change."}
{"text":"I love Grovewood tavern! I have been going to the restaurant for 5years now. I have never had a bad meal. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menus and wines. I have a gluten allergy & I'm lactose intolerant and they always can find something delish on the menu for me.  The best!"}
{"text":"Now serving brunch!  I had dinner a few years back at Grovewood Tavern and remember it being pretty solid. But that was in my pre-vegan days. Now? I'm a pickier eater and it's harder to find decent vegan breakfast eats on the east side. Through the power of social media, I learned that Grovewood Tavern is now serving Sunday brunch (10 am - 2 pm) so my boyfriend and I checked it out and had an amazing meal.  Things that stood out to me? - Multiple vegan and vegetarian options on the menu (clearly labeled, too) - Locally sourced eggs, meats, and more - An extensive brunch booze menu - Really kick ass grub  I ordered a tofu scramble. I generally like tofu scrambles, but...they can be a little lacking in flavor sometimes. Not this scramble! There were peppers, and onions, and kale, and peppers, and crispy breakfast potatoes all jumbled up together in a delicious heap. On the side, I got toast with a side of house made fig jam. I'm not even the biggest fig fan, but this jam was pretty incredible.  My boyfriend ordered the breakfast biscuit. Clearly, with sausage, eggs, and a cheesy biscuit, it ain't my cup of tea, but he said that his meal was one of the best brunch meals he's ever had. Hands down. Also important to note, he was a big fan of their coffee. I would have liked a cup, too, but they don't have any soy/almond/etc. milk to use as creamer. Weep womp. (maybe next time?)  This brunch spot is definitely worth checking out. Not into brunch? Check them out for dinner. They have a pretty extensive menu with options for vegans, vegetarians, and your most hardcore carnivore."}
{"text":"This place is always a favorite when I'm home! Killer cocktails, great selection of beer and wine, and the food is fantastic! the bison pot roast is DELICIOUS. I got it to share, and immediately wanted to keep it all for myself! The maple adobo pork shank is also very tasty, and has a lot of meat! they change their menu fairly regularly and are always putting new season items on the menu that sound exciting."}
{"text":"Great food options, nice presentation, small and comfortable environment."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places in the entire state to eat. I've been here over 10 times and every time I've been here it's been beyond great. If I was on death row this would be my final meal request. The Duck is unbelievable and their steaks are second to none. I love their local inspired menu and awesome specials. The service is better than most and they always keep your drink full. It can sometimes get a little loud in the dining room on the weekends and I suggest you make reservations if you have a chance because it's not a large place and they are always busy. The spicy noodles are a must. I was scared to try them at first but now I get them every time I go here. I can't say enough about this place, I'm pretty sure it's one of my favorite places of all time."}
{"text":"Grovewood Tavern is a small restaurant/bar hidden in a quiet neighborhood in northeast Cleveland.  I had never heard of it before being given a strong recommendation from a co-worker.  After going there for dinner, I'm surprised that more people don't talk about it.  The dining room is relatively small and the wine selection is large. The menu is moderately priced ($20-$30 for a dinner entree) and there is quite a variety of entrees to choose from. Some of the more unique menu choices are the bison sandwich and a duck entree prepared with a cherry sauce.  I ordered the blackened diver scallops, which were perfectly cooked in a delicious cream sauce.  I thought the side of cheddar mashed potatoes mixed with chorizo sausage was a good complement to the tender and tasty scallops.  The lava chocolate cake was a great way to finish the meal.  If you drive on I-90 through northeast Cleveland, stop by this place sometime.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food was incredible. Had a cleveland mimosa and bison potroast hash for brunch. The bison was so tender it melts in your mouth. Seating was a bit hectic but it was very busy. We will definitely go back to try the dinners."}
{"text":"I had a really great experience at Grovewood Tavern.  A co-worker recommended this place as a nice spot to dine in Cleveland and I really enjoyed it.  Upon approaching the building, I wasn't sure what the inside would be like but was pleasantly surprised by the welcoming environment.  I was happy to see some very unique items on the menu and was double happy to see that they serve Rose'.  I started with a glass of that with the delicious focacia bread with balsamic dipping sauce.  For my main course I had a special:  scallops with cheese grits and asparagus.  It was very good.  Everyone at my table enjoyed the items that they ordered (especially the mac n cheese).  The creme brulee dessert was to die for.  This was a unique dining experience and a good meal to enjoy on a cold Cleveland night!"}
{"text":"I have to give this restaurant a 5 for a few reasons.  1) How brave!  They are nestled on a side street of a not so friendly neighborhood but thrive.  There has always been a police officer there on the weekends and select weekdays when I go.    2) Kitchen masters.  Sit at the bar and watch the chef's/cook's at work towards the end of the bar.  I understand that there is another kitchen doing most of the prep but there is still 90%+ of all cooking done in this area during dinner and do they fly the food out.  3) Wine assortment and beer options.  They even do dinner matching with each during all months throughout the year.  How fun.    4) Food.  This is where they exceed given the other options within a 5 mile radius (exception of Bistro 185).  I suggest the mussels, fondue, or tuna as a sharing app, or even a salad.  I always go for the special based on food service knowledge that it tends to be whats freshest.  Don't be afraid to ask though, they will be happy to match your dinner entree to your taste buds.    Con - I am not particularly a fan of the Yacatori (spelling?) but they sell A LOT of it so I'll leave that review up to you.    Just go, have fun, sit at a high top in the bar, and just order away.  BIG PLUS is to check www.restaurant.com, they just joined.  I bought 4 the first day and have used 2 already."}
{"text":"YES! A great find that even a lot of locals don't know about. We have some friends who've lived in Cleveland forever so they always know about these lesser-known spots. On their advice we went for the first time on my birthday and have since been back once. Wow! This place was so unique and we really had a great experience both times.  On our first visit, we arrived before the rest of our group and I was starving so we sat at the bar and had a beer and tried the potstickers. Service at the bar was super-friendly and the potstickers were great.  For dinner I had surf and turf - perfectly cooked and delicious. Sean has gotten the 'quackitori' both times and loved it. Really, the duck is so tender and well seasoned.  The other night I had probably one of the top 5 pasta dishes I've ever had. Yes, at the Grovewood! It was the pasta of the day special - Ohio City whole wheat fettuccine carbonara. WOW was it fantastic! I've been raving about it ever since to anyone who'll listen. We also shared a cheese plate and there was plenty for the 4 of us and was very good and reasonably priced.  The Grovewood reminds me of the good ol' Wisconsin supper clubs that my grandparents took us to for special occassions. Very low-key atmosphere and great food every time. The Grovewood has lots of nightly specials, a big wine list, and we've had great service.  After these two experiences, Grovewood is solidly in our rotation for great local places to take out of town guests - and of course to hang with our local peeps too.   Definitely give this place a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very quaint little restaurant with some exquisite dishes and a well rounded wine selection.    This small tavern just north of I-90 on the East side might be easy to miss (looks like a home), but it's one you should not miss.  The menu has a huge selection, and the four of us thorough enjoyed our meal.  I had sesame crusted seared tuna served with pasta.  The dish was beautifully plated, and the accompanying sauces and shaved ginger brought out tremendous flavor.  One of the others memorable entrees was the \"Cake and Steak\" (crab cakes with beef tenderloin).  I also enjoyed a smooth and rich bowl of butternut squash soup.    The server recommended a few delicious wine options.  Robust cab and titillating Riesling  both matched dishes very well.  The server was just attentive enough - there when we needed her, but not hovering.    The restaurant was cozy and warm, and the folks at the bar were friendly and easy going.    I will return to sample other menu items (lots of others caught my attention)."}
{"text":"An earlier review said this place was a diamond in the rough. I definitely agree. From the appetizer to dessert, this restaurant was fantastic. I had the cake and steak, which was crab cakes and steak medallions. The crab cakes are very tasty. The chocolate lava cake is amazing! If you like chocolate, this dessert is the way to go.   We live in Cleveland, and would never have known it was there if it weren't for Yelp.  Great place! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the best meal in a long time. Hard to find good places that are open on a Sunday. Jim our waiter was excellent and had us try wine that would pair nicely with our dinners!! He was spot on!!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. I had the pasta dish with chicken and thought it was average. The main reason for my discontent is the rude customer service. Our group was asked to leave after about 1.5hrs even though we had already paid our bill and wrapping up our conversation anyways. I have never experienced this at any restaurant before and I'm very well travelled (Dubai, NYC, Paris, Toronto just to name a few). Worst case scenario restaurants ask u multiple times if you want anything else after sitting around for 3+ hrs. My first and last time at GWT. Very awful feeling!"}
{"text":"Was there the other night - the Quackitori (Yakitori with seared duck breast, chilled, spicy, sesame noodles and seaweed salad was fantastic as usual!  Not your typical menu!  Great selection! Also always something new and interesting on tap, and extensive wine selection!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times for dinner and drinks, but never on New Year's Eve!   So this year we decided to ring in the new year at Grovewood Tavern and what a wonderful experience to begin and end the year with.  As always the cuisine, waitstaff and overall ambience and experience was spectacular.   I typically default to the shrimp yakitori but this evening I was swayed by our waitress who suggested the ribeye. Arguably one of the best steaks I have ever had.  The atmosphere is quaint and kitschy, the bar inventory is amazing with many microbrew and great wines available. Plus also on our waitresses suggestion I tried a new Polish potato vodka that I have never had before and from what I remember it was great!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a relaxing dinner with three other ladies here on 5/8/14. It was my fourth visit, and I will definitely eat at Grovewood Tavern and Wine Bar again. It's very quaint, with interior string lights that lend a very warm ambiance to the space. The tables were nicely laid out, and the chairs were comfortable. I started with a glass of diLenardo Pinot Grigio, which I found to be extremely smooth. For an appetizer I had the tavern salad. It consisted of fresh mesclun greens and spinach with some nice gorgonzola,, toasted walnuts, and a vinaigrette dressing. It was a  good, simple salad. For my entree I had the Polenta Bolognese. The portion was enough for two days, and they happily gave me  a box for my leftovers. For dessert I had the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream. It was far too much for one person, and I couldn't finish it. It was however, very good. The service was very good. We were attended to, but the server wasn't intrusive. They gladly split our checks for us, and gratuity was not added. I loved the wine so much that I asked the server to write down the name for me. She gave me a copy of the drinks list with the wine highlighted. One final note: they do have options for vegetarians, vegans, and those on a gluten-free diet. There aren't as many as you might find at other restaurants, but you won't find yourself limited to salad."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a nice dinner.  Now, I haven't sat down here for any event other than a beer or wine dinner, but these are always wonderful (and very reasonably priced).  The atmosphere is soft and inviting, and I really like the set-up of the joint.  It is basically two long rooms, one with tables for seating, and the other the beer/wine bar.  It is really a great place to just come and enjoy an evening, especially if you are out in that area, right off E. 185th Street.  My suggestion is to go to one of the beer or wine dinners that are so often a part of Grovewood's plans.  They do a great job with the food and the pairings, and as I said, it is very reasonably priced for the quality and amount of food, paired with a beautiful atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  What a cool place in the middle of who knows where. My friend showed me this great place, claiming it was one of the best of Cleveland's dining. And he was right.  We went during happy hour and sat at the bar. It's a cozy bar/restaurant, one where you'll find locals hanging out at. They have quite the selection of brews (I learned there was an Ohio Brewing Company? Never knew that before...), and the appetizers were cheap during happy hour....and GOOD.  We ordered the mussels, the stuffed peppers, and the crabcakes. OMG, the mussels were great! They were big, fresh, and super super tasty. All for $5. The plate was huge for that price...and the mussels were really tasty. The stuffed peppers were good as well- they were banana peppers stuffed with some type of sausage/chorizo mixture...definitely was on the spicy side but good as well. The crabcake was a good amount....I think I've had better crabcakes elsewhere, but it was still overall, pretty good.  Big thumbs up for this local bar/restaurant.  Definitely a cool picture of Cleveland. I'm going to have to try dinner there sometime again..."}
{"text":"Truly one of my favorite places in all of Cleveland.  I know -- it can be a bit of a drive for most folks. I promise it is worth it.    The wine list is always so much better than other area restaurants.  Great French and cool Washington state reds. The food always blows me away, as well. Happy hour can't be beat, but really anything on the dinner menu is delicious.  I especially love that they've started doing brunch -- the South by Southwest (cheddar biscuits with chorizo gravy) are  SO GOOD. OMG.  One of my favorite things that they do are the monthly wine dinners.  If you ever get a chance to go to one, do not pass on it.  So worth every penny.  Absolutely perfect pairings -- you leave stuffed, happy and mayyyybe a little buzzed..."}
{"text":"An amazing brunch. There was no one here though - we were the only people seated outside and inside there was only one other table. Why does no one go here? Try it out, Yelpers! It is not on the main drag of the Waterloo area, but it is one minute away in a quiet residential neighborhood. There is street parking right out from of the patio and plenty of it.   The drinks are amazing. I don't normally like Bloody Mary's ($8.50) but the one here is amazing. The bartender told us that just the Sunday morning we were there she had made her own pepper vodka by infusing five types of fresh hot peppers into Vodka. It made the drink amazing. The Fresh Fruit Mojito drink is also amazing - very light and refreshing. The fruit flavor changes. It was elderberry the morning I had it ($8). Many of the drinks, including these two, can be made non-alcoholic too.   For brunch I got the South by Southwest ($13) which comes with a homemade cheddar scallion biscuit topped with one poached egg on each of the two biscuits. You get to pick either chorizo or mushroom gravy (I chose chorizo) to have poured on top that plus a side of fruit, and grits or breakfast potatoes (my choice). The chorizo gravy was amazing! You should get a side of it to go with whatever you order! My friend ordered the chicken and waffles (Fried Chicken and Johnnycakes - $13) and a side of the chorizo gravy after tasting mine. The dish came with braised greens & the johnnycakes were clearly homemade as well. Many of the dishes are also already gluten free or have a gluten free option - same for vegan.  For friendly service, a quiet atmosphere, and amazing - homemade - drinks and food definitely visit Grovewood."}
{"text":"Went here on a double date.  The group was seated promptly at this no-frills tavern.  I wouldn't quite call it a wine bar... but they do have a respectable list of options for drinks.  The bf and I ordered the short rib - which I would rate a 4 on food alone, and the bison pot roast - which unfortunately earns a 2.5 on food alone.  Maybe I had my expectations set to high based on reviews, but nobody in the party was overly happy with the food.  I would say the short rib was by far the favorite.  I think it's a possible option for some decent food in a casual atmosphere if you're near by.  But for us, it was a bit of a drive and an effort that unfortunately is unlikely to be repeated.  ----------------------------------- Explanation of my rating system - 5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back 4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category 3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either. 2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it. 1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
