{"text":"Best Mexican food I have found in the South Charlotte area. Service was quick and attentive throughout our evening.  My chili relleno and enchilada was wonderful. Others in my party found the soup to be too salty. This would have been a five star rating except for the temperature of the building. Staff apologized, saying while the AC worked, its size was not large enough to cool their restaurant in this hot weather. They had fans throughout, making the temp barely acceptable. Blame the owner of the building, not the restaurant. We'll be back as soon as the weather cools a little bit."}
{"text":"I am a local, and was excited when this place opened, I have been to don julios twice, and never again. Today my workers and I had to seat ourselves, with only four tables being used, then we waited, and waited, to have someone ask us about drinks, although both waiters were talking beside the drink machine, and finally we.got to order, but still no drinks, or menus, so we asked for them, then the meal came, one order had two hairs in it, and my steak fajitas had two pcs of steak on the platter, so yes we just wanted to pay and get out of there, to never return, but it gets better, they didnt have  change for a $100, so I waited for 15 minutes on a $9.00 bill, but I had $7.75 on me, but no they preferred to keep me waiting and go door to door to get change, instead of taking a little over a dollar off!  needless to say, never coming back, I had high hopes, but was let down completely..."}
{"text":"Updated - not so great anymore.  service is really lacking, staff doesn't know the menu."}
{"text":"Paid $50.00 for 3 plates of slop and a bowl of cheese dip. Service was good, but food was terrible and the place is dirty. There was food all over the floor and had a 91.5 sanitation grade. Tried , but will not be going back."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable dinner, while being very well tended too. Much appreciated! It is family owned and operated, which we like supporting, so we will go again when we are feeling for some good Mexican food. We wish them the very best."}
{"text":"Authentic really good Mexican, reasonably priced, good margaritas, fresh chips and salsa. Give it a try."}
{"text":"I've lived all over the country  (West coast to East coast) and this is some of the best mexican food I've ever had. The salsa is AMAZING, the chips were perfect, the street tacos came with a whole grilled onion and jalapeno that tasted SO good and were a nice touch. The enchiladas were good also. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Meh, it is what it is and what it is IS something I don't want to try again. I read on my neighborhood Facebook page that we had a new hot spot in the area and I kept blowing pass the post as I enjoy eating in other areas. This one night we decided to go out for dinner and we were all tired and not interested in driving far so we ended up here. Upon entry we were greeted and sat immediately. I noticed off back that the ventilation wasn't good as there was thick clouds of smoke. Good smelling smoke hit very thick which made it hard to breathe deeply.  Once seated, we ordered the appetizer guac. It came out quickly but looked like a pile of SLIMMER from old school Ghost Busters. I ignored the appearance and we dug in. It was the most bland guac I've ever tasted. I notified our waitress and let her know that it was bland and that we didn't want it.  A short while later the guac is replaced on the table. So basically we were forced to eat it after they took it back and remixed it with salt or something (insert ARE YOU KIDDING face).  The only edible item that was ordered between the three entrees was the skillet that our teenager ordered.   We won't visit again unless it was the end of the world and this was the only place to get a skillet. We would much rather drive to get flavor."}
{"text":"We have been to Don Julio's several times and have enjoyed the food every time. It is a fairly small, casual place, but a great addition to Waxhaw, The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the margaritas are only ok, not great. That won't stop us from going back though!"}
{"text":"Our entire family loves it here! The food is good, it seems very authentic, everything is fresh, and we never wait for a table!   It's not fancy digs, so if you're expecting the Ritz, go somewhere else! Come here for the food!"}
{"text":"This was our second visit to DJ and it might not have happened if we had a similar experience on our first. Our first visit was shortly after opening and we rarely review because of predictable startup challenges. For the record, our first visit would have garnered 3 stars. During our initial visit, I asked a number of question to familiarize myself with the menu. Also inquired about a favorite dish I enjoyed during my time in SoCal....Chili Verde. Our waiter went to the kitchen returning with a thumbs up. Next time you visit just ask and the chef can prepare the CV. Hence our return visit, which was a bit disappointing as the chef wasn't as accommodating saying \"no special orders\"!  Okay but the excuses regarding no margaritas because the bartender didn't show for work, stale chips and mediocre over cooked-tasteless pork dish might be more expected in a grand opening! Waxhaw needs a quality Mexican restaurant and based on our experience may still be looking!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned authentic Mexican restaurant and the best in Waxhaw in my opinion.  In addition to the superb food, the quality of the service sets this establishment apart.  The servers dotted on us and clearly appreciated our business."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. Had tacos asada and the were delicious! Service was good, kept drinks filled during visit. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Small but with wonderful food, highly recommended. Pollo Chipotle is a top notch dish 10/10."}
{"text":"In one word: disappointing.  Perhaps the style of this Mexican eatery is typical of some place in Mexico, but what is served here is pretty blah.  Our discovery of blah started with the salsa served upon seating with tortilla chips.  A thin, tomato sauce looking more like tomato juice but not as thick or flavorful had raw onion, scallions and bits of carrot floating in it.  It was so thin that it would not stick to the tortilla chips and why bother when it tasted only of the raw onions?  We were rolling quickly down hill.   The servers seem like family.  They are attentive, active, answer your questions and do a great job in getting orders in and out.  The manager circulates to check-in on the customers.    The menu is great with lunch specials and many combinations with prices generally less than $10.  However, the proof is in the tame, tasteless blah pudding of the food.   The enchiladas, of both cheese and beef, were flavorless, whether with their red or green sauces, both sauces were indistinguishable in taste...there wasn't any.  Rice and beans, yes, were blah as they usually were so together with the enchiladas made for a meal that blindfolded you would not know what you were eating.  Just blah mushy stuff.  Well blahness continued to dominate and ultimately won.  So we journeyed further.  In most Mexican restaurants you can ask for and receive \"chilies vinagre\" which are jalapeno peppers, carrots and onions pickled in vinegar as an accompaniment.  Asked the waitress and she said with great enthusiasm that they had them and brought me a small bowl of sliced jalapenos, like you would buy for nachos.  Ummm...I knew we had an unsolvable problem in trying to gain a foothold on taste and flavor.  The server did mention that they had a hotter salsa so we asked for some.  It also was mild with a back of the throat hotness but otherwise resembled a watered-down Thousand Island dressing without any chunks or particular flavor.  The stuffed chilies rellenos were awful, stuffed with Parmesan cheese and another off-putting  smelly cheese.  Both my wife and I could not stomach them, let alone get them past our noses.  But a table across from us, occupied by a couple of very senior people commented that they liked the rellenos!  So take that with a grain of salt as elder people reach a point where their taste buds need a lot to pick up taste and these awful peppers did the trick for them.  If you have lost your sense of taste, come for the rellenos.  Understandingly, restaurants cater to local tastes so that they can accommodate local patrons.  The Midwest of the USA is well-known as having a palate that does not like spice, even pepper is considered way too much, and when it comes to heat they will recoil in horror and not even taste the serving.  Chinese and other ethnic restaurants know this and dumb down their foods. The Charlotte area has many fine ethnic restaurants that so not shy away from their traditional food preparations and that is true of other Mexican restaurants in the area.   But for those aficionados of blahness, Don Julio's is your place.  Disappointing otherwise."}
{"text":"Just paid $10 for chips & salsa to-go. Not going back, I'll stick with Chili's at $3.59 to-go."}
{"text":"Ordered the fajitas & veggie enchiladas for take out - both were very good.  The creamy sauce on the enchiladas was delicious.  Glad there is an authentic Mexican restaurant in Waxhaw for take out or eat in - the restaurant looked nice and clean."}
{"text":"They only had one cook working on Cinco De Mayo. I let the server know several times that I could not have dairy and asked if my dish was dairy free. The menu did not list cheese as a topping either, which is why I picked this dish instead of others. After a very long wait for our food, my meal had cheese on it. I had to send it back because I am lactose intolerant. When it came back it was missing the mushrooms and avocado and had less shrimp than the first time it came out.  The server acted as though she was annoyed with me for needing to send the food back and for requesting the items missing when I received the dish back. The skinny margarita was tasty but super overpriced at $13.00 which the menu doesn't list. We came here because of the wait at El Vallerta tonight but we will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to have another Mexican restaurant in the hood. The ambience is aged. As far as the food goes, I was not impressed. Store bought tortillas..."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 4 times now and every time it has been great. Al pastor tacos are fantastic ( not on the menu) Long with the Carnitas de Puerco and don't forget the guacamole!!!  Service has been spot on and friendly. This place reminds me of our fav taqueria in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"I got hair in my salad once in the past... I decided to give them another chance ........today I got raw chicken in my salad. I'm done."}
{"text":"We love this place. Way better than the Mexican restaurant up the street. Have had great service and always enjoyed our meals.   Have been there three times."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drink made fresh daily!  Reasonable priced food items.  Homemade Salsa and homemade chips free when ordering.  If you like Mexican you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday  WOW was it Great!!! Food very very good Service very very good Prices very very good Food very fresh and tasty  Place very clean & neat And as a nice surprise they bring you a very nice dessert after your meal Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"The food is good; however, my wait person didn't check on us at all from the time our food got to the table until we got the check.  Everyone's glass was empty by then.  I will probably give them another chance, but the service was disappointing."}
{"text":"Spinach dip looked like soup but was amazing, too bad it dripped all over my flavor savors! Had the beef fajita and the steak was so tender and flavorful, the portion was huge too. Salsa had a kick. Get the Mexican Coke bottle (has cane sugar not HFS) to compliment your meal. Service was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"The ambiance isn't anything extraordinary, but the food here is EXCELLENT! If not the best, it's way up there in terms of what Charlotte has to offer for inexpensive Mexican food. It shows when something is cooked and prepared with love. Server was also extremely pleasant and helpful. Our family will be adding Don Julio to our regular rotation. WAY better than El Vallarta up the street (way, way better)."}
{"text":"It all was pretty average. We will keep looking to find our go to Mexican restaurant, but this place is fine for something close by."}
{"text":"The food tastes better than it looked. I got the huevos with corn tortillas and rice and beans. The refried beans were paltry and the cheese melted on top was oily. That, in addition to the orangey rice, really put off my appetite. Ask for black beans instead of refried beans.   My mom got the grilled vegetable salad, which she thought was odd since it also comes with mangos, strawberries, and melon. She said there were too many onions and red peppers, and it would have been better with just the fruit."}
{"text":"A solid, family friendly Mexican restaurant. Food is very good. Lunch prices are really reasonable and portions are large for the price. We have not tried dinner there, yet. Happy to have a solid Mexican restaurant close to our new home!!"}
{"text":"I've only been to this place once. My girlfriend and I visited her sister here in Waxhaw and she took us to this little place. The food was pretty good, it's basically your generic Mexican restaurant. Her sister brought her 11 month old child and asked for a soft taco with her meal instead of a hard one for him. We got our order and behold, there was no soft taco. We asked and asked continuously for a soft taco and right before we got our bill our waiter came with a plate. With tears of joy in our eyes we thought this was the soft taco at last. When we looked at it we realized he only brought us the soft shell... We had to make the taco OURSELVES. When we asked about this he simply said \"sorry, we're just really busy.\" This literally blew us away. You should be able to have a busy restaurant and bring out a soft taco to fix the mistake that you made. All in all, the food wasn't bad but the service could use some work (which is why I chose two stars)."}
{"text":"We were in the area and was planning on going to a different restaurant. We ended up coming here and I kind of regret doing so. I called this place and another place to see how long the wait time was. Don Julio's was 5 mins and another mexican restaurant was a 25 min wait. That right there should of told me not to come here. We came in. Waited at the hostess stand. We waited and waited. A good several mins. We saw no workers. And I knew they knew we were here because the door buzzed when we walked in. We finally got sat in the worst seat ever. We got sat next to a group of 20 women all drunk and loud. I couldn't even hear myself think or speak. We ordered our food and it came in a timely matter but I was surprised at how insanely greasy the beef was. It was oozing out. I'm not a picky mexican food eater but it was so bad I didn't even finish my food or ask for a to go box. We won't come back."}
{"text":"I think if you are in the Waxhaw area, the better option is El Vallarta. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his food. However I was disappointed with the service. There was only one other party in the restaurant and our server only took our order and someone else brought it to us and then never came back until we got our check. They do have various salsas but apparantly you have to ask for them. I'm not sure I would go back unless El Vallarta was closed. I would not recommend the shrimp fajitas. There was no flavor. My husband did enjoy his steak and cheese burrito."}
{"text":"Everything and everyone is very good. The green salsa (you have to ask for it) is great. Enjoyed the pollo con mole."}
{"text":"We've been twice now and love the salsa. Yum. The spicier one. Both times we got the pork carnitas and both times did not disappoint. Authentic. Good margarita as well. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really great addition to the Waxhaw area.  Very good Mexican food. Service very attentive and it is obvious they care about their food and customer service."}
{"text":"I have to tell you my experience with Mexican food before I tell you about Don Julio's. I was born in Mexico City and raised in Austin, Texas - one of the foodie hubs in the US. I grew up with my mom making Mexican from scratch and was lucky enough to marry a woman that also makes the stuff from scratch -- we're talking a half day to make enchiladas...So trust me when I tell you, I KNOW quality Mexican food.   Don Julio's is hands down one of our favorite Mexican food spots, ever. My wife and I moved to the area last year and were sorely disappointed with the lack of quality Mexican food. We tried the place across the street, a few places in Ballantyne and Charlotte, and all were a 2-star experience, at best. Finding Don Julio's was our saving grace.   The first thing you should know about Don Julio's is that they make their dishes from scratch, daily. How many places can say that? If you visit enough times you can actually taste this in the chips and salsa. The salsa is great every time, but you do notice the slight difference texture and spiciness. And let me tell you about the salsa - again, this is prepared daily with smoked peppers and tomatoes and you taste this in every bite. If this is the care and quality that goes in the salsa that you get with chips, you can only imagine the care that goes into the entrees.   One of my favorite reasons for eating at Don Julio's (and this is important if you don't have a lot of experience with authentic Mexican food) is the authenticity! The chile rellenos come with queso fresco, the way you would find them in some regions in Mexico. The enchiladas can be traditional red, green and even mole, again, the way you'd find them in Mexico. Already touched on the salsa, but the smoky flavors are very authentic and hard to find around these parts. If you have an adventurous palette order the carnitas in mole. I was surprised to even find this on the menu, let alone find it with such great quality. So if you're used to \"Mexican food\" being the place across the street, some American hybrid (like Tex-Mex or SoCal Mex) or some local chain that charges $3 for tacos, this place may not be what you're used to, but I guarantee you it's incredible."}
{"text":"DON'T EVEN BOTHER!!!  I have never in my life seem such unprofessionalism. A lady, I'm assuming was  the owner by the way that she was speaking was extremely condescending to her employees. What a huge turn off. The food was expensive for Mexican in a strip mall and subpar at that. I just still cannot get past the way that she treated her staff. She needs to be aware that many people in this day and age are bilingual and can understand what is being said. I feel sorry for her employees"}
{"text":"Yes, my go to place for great Mexican food. Great service plus affordable prices. Definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican.   The tacos de carne Asada are very authentic.  They have aguas fresca but they are just a little off.  Worth another trip."}
