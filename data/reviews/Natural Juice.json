{"text":"Someone brought me here with the promise of a a \"spring roll burrito\" and I admit, I was confused but intrigued. This gem of a food cart offers a truly oversized spring roll (about the size of a really stuffed Chipotle burrito) with avocado and your choice of protein for between $3-$4, in addition to a tasty selection of juices and smoothies for a similar price. Inside the spring roll are cucumbers, rice noodles, lettuce, and other delicious, healthy goodies inside! The wait is a little longer than some other carts, as there is only one person (wo)manning the place, but it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"I always get the spring roll. Definitely worth the wait and its cost. The owner is very kind as well."}
{"text":"I started going my Freshmen year in 2006 and still visit the Smoothie Lady, as I call her, as often as possible 10 years later. I even moved to California and back. No change in optimal deliciousness and affordability.   Kim, the owner, is always delightful. Their spring rolls are bonkers - a full salad w fresh avo wrapped in rice paper (legitimately the size of my face, and I have a regular size face, I promise). Can always use extra peanut sauce, but what can't? She makes them fresh to order for you every time.  Smoothies are bomb. I usually opt for the mango / soursop / blueberry - because soursop and jackfruit are, apparently, delicious. Can also go super healthy with spinach, carrot, etc. They're on the icy vs total shredded fruit side, which is super refreshing. Had a full lunch w smoothie and monster spring roll for $7 today, can't go wrong. #lifer"}
{"text":"The food carts are my favorite thing about Madison. And of all of them, this is the best one. Kim, the lady who runs the food cart all by herself, is one of the nicest people I've ever met. Her smile and positive demeanor is infectious! On top of that, her spring rolls are to die for. They're about the size of a burrito, and they're only $3-4! If you're looking for cheap, healthy, high quality food or fruity drinks/smoothies served with a bright smile, you've got to try this food cart."}
{"text":"Kim makes the best healthy green drink and her generous size spring rolls are delicious and made to order. The food is so good that I eat there regularly and bring my friends. Kim's food is worth the wait...you can taste the love in every bite."}
{"text":"Love the carts. Pretty much love all the carts. But whenever I eat from any of the carts this must accompany my meal. She has a really large variety of fruits to make smoothies and you can mix and match. There are also non-fruit things that you can add like chocolate but I always stick to the fruit. MmmmmmmMMm."}
{"text":"An ideal day, for me, goes like this:  I hop on my bicycle and head down to E Campus Mall to find this food truck. I order a deliciously fresh all fruit smoothies and a spicy spring roll.   I consume the delicious fruit smoothie for breakfast and put the spring roll away in my pack (for lunch!) and ride off into the sunshine.   The best.   This place is healthy, fresh, delicious, and CHEAP."}
{"text":"I found myself going to her at first for her smoothies beginning my freshman year, and then slowly falling in love with her spring rolls. Two years later, I still visit her for her bright smile and her bubbly personality as she asks me what I want, although I've become quite the regular, so she knows what I like! Her spring rolls are almost as big as my face, and stuffed with the freshest vegetables and topped with the perfect amount of spiciness! Definitely a must for visitors and even for locals! She honestly is one of the hardest working ladies I know, as she's always out there on Library Mall bright and early and usually is the last to leave, and she still radiates with gentleness and energy! I will definitely miss Madison if not for the beautiful sights, for the spring rolls from this wonderful place."}
{"text":"Nice smoothies but this review is more a plug for their spring rolls-- not sure if these are a regular item (there was a sign taped to the straw dispenser advertising them), but a single spring roll here was nearly as big as a burrito-- so a spring roll and a smoothie will pretty much set you up for lunch!"}
{"text":"We generally head to Madison a few times per year to hit up the Dane Co Farmers Market (because it's amazing!). The Natural Juice cart is almost always on the agenda because, let's face it - the market is CROWDED. The sea of humanity can get overwhelming, especially on a hot day.  Enter \"break time\" at the Natural Juice cart - the ladies that work here are fast and pleasant. Their juice is fresh and delicious and reasonably priced. The Mister generally gets a smoothie but I stick with refreshing, tart limeade.  One other plus - you can get creative and design your own smoothie flavor. Want a soursop and blackberry? Chocolate and avocado? Blackberry and jackfruit? No problem - they'll make it for you."}
{"text":"Mmm. This is one of my favorite carts when visiting the downtown Farmer's Market, or any downtown fairs. I swear I had my first Natural Juice smoothie about a decade ago, and they're just perfect for those crowded summer events.  My most recent visit was during the Art Fairs On/Off the Square. I'd decided to focus on the local artists to begin with and rejoiced when I saw this cart on the first corner I walked up to after parking. I can't turn down a fresh fruit smoothie - pretty much anytime - but on a sunny and humid day this was the perfect treat. I'm a sucker for any of the options that include yogurt, but I've tried many and they're all delicious and refreshing.  The ladies who run the cart are always friendly and service is fast as can be. While I usually only go for a beverage, their spring rolls are also very tasty.   When I'm out and about at a downtown event and the other options are questionable 'lemonade', overpriced bottles of water, or soda, I always go for this whole-ingredient option."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review. I graduated from Madison in 2011 and hands down, Kim's smoothie cart is a must visit whenever I'm in town. Kim is warm, friendly, and puts so much love into everything that she makes! Whenever I was feeling homesick or missing my family, a visit to her felt like home. Tip-- I've never ordered anything off the menu! I just ask her to make whatever is \"ng√¥n\"/delicious and she never disappoints! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The peanut sauce in the spring roll is so delicious! I ended up getting the mild which had the right amount of kick. I love spicy food and I thought the mild felt like a medium spicy. So for those who can't handle too much spicy, I would get mild. I got the shrimp and avocado and it was so yummy! I can't wait to try other kinds and the smoothies as well."}
