{"text":"We had the worst dinner at Scratch House this evening. Service was horrible and the food was even worse. The crab cakes were dry on the inside and drowned in an awful sauce. The steak was seriously undercooked and came back as tough as leather. The GM Jamie made apologies and offered a complimentary dessert  that our waiter took the liberty of choosing for us.....thanks."}
{"text":"We went to go and support this new eatery in town based on decent family recommendations, for Dinner. As with most of the reviews here on Yelp for this restaurant, the service was better than average, however, with room for improvement. We skipped the wine and drinks as we are all about the food. The food, basically was hit or miss. The filet minion was cooked to a perfect medium rare, as ordered. The NY strip was served rare when ordered medium, after the NY strip returned from the kitchen for \"some more heat\", it was between rare and medium rare.  We took the steak home so We could finish cooking it as it was tasty. The red wine sauce we would like to purchase by the gallon as it was outstanding. This place seems to be many things and appears a little harried at times. The service staff does seem to care, but one doesn't really go out to spend the type of $$$ they charge for an apologetic staff that needs to cover for the inconsistencies in the kitchen. The fact that people watching can be done does add a bit of \"cafe\" atmosphere, but again, the prices are a bit out of line."}
{"text":"We had a big party here.  They split our group into two and put us in different parts of the restaurant (one group outside on the sidewalk and one up in the backroom).  They had one bar tender for a group of 50+.  The food was terrible.  The chicken came out over cooked and so dry it was unpalatable.  The salmon was served pan seared and raw in the middle.  (No option was given for cooking preference, and everyone assumed it would come out cooked all the way through.)  Water/non-bar drinks were never refilled.  It was an overall disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Las Vegas Strip quality food at a very reasonable price, right in the heart of sleepy Boulder City. Definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it!  Everything is prepared and created in house -- hence the name. The quality of the food is very high, and the taste and presentation are phenomenal. The staff are all very kind and well trained.  If you're going for lunch, I recommend the chicken wrap or the lasagna. Or anything really! I haven't had one thing that didn't taste absolutely wonderful."}
{"text":"We decided to have lunch and it was excellent.  Everything is made from scratch, even the ketchup.  Very good food, portion sizes were perfect and it was just delicious, can't wait to try it for dinner."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had, scallops are amazing and better then I had growing up on the California coast. Service is by far the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing!  If you are in the Vegas valley area, this is an experience not to be missed!!"}
{"text":"Scratch House is our new \"go to\" place for a nice dinner.  We live in Las Vegas and enjoy getting out of the city to a nice and quaint setting as is BC.  Scratch House makes everything from scratch, of course, and we had THE BEST dinner ever.  Our group of 8 ordered a variety of dishes and all were delicious.  European trained chef, Silvui, provided us with a real culinary treat.  We are looking forward to a return visit and would also love to try lunch.  Prices are so reasonable its definitely worth our drive from LV!"}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time here.  Had a late lunch today and once again, Scratch did not disappoint!  Hubby had the club sandwich and said it was \"delish\" & that everything in his sandwich was fresh & had great taste, even the bread.  I had fish & chips and I must say it was the best I've had in .. I can't remember how long!!  YUM!  The fish was flavorful & fresh and the batter was perfect: light, crisp & not oily or greasy at all, like with other places that serve fish & chips.  And the beer was nice & cold!  Yes!  In addition to the food being great, the service was 2nd to none.  Our server, Melissa, was the best:  attentive, personable, courteous - we did not want for anything.  It's nice to go to a restaurant where the customer matters and that's exactly how we felt. Big thanks to everyone Scratch!"}
{"text":"Visited Boulder City today and stopped at the Scratch House for brunch. Simply TERRIBLE! I ordered the \"Classic\" Eggs Benedict, my friends ordered the Scratch House Special  Eggs Benedict and the Simply WOW Biscuits and Gravy. Let me tell you,  all the meals were anything but WOW! The \"Classic\" was on a biscuit not an English Muffin. All the biscuits were so hard and dry I needed to request more gravy for the biscuits and even I had to add it to my eggs bene. Everything was devoid of any semblance of moisture or taste.  We all used the extra gravy simply to moisten the inedible food on our plates. My poached eggs had hard yolks but runny whites!?!? Normally potatoes are my saving grace for poor food, not this time! Hard, dry and no seasonings. I don't recommend this place at all.  Sorry, Scratch House, you suck."}
{"text":"Beautiful night in Boulder city , wanted cocktails and apps,wanted to try Scratch House we have already had their brunch very good, but wanted to try something else, I ordered the mushroom  risotto,OMG so good that I made sounds and my husband told me to shhsh! Cant wait to go  back for full course dinner, chef came out and asked how everything was very good service and great food!!!"}
{"text":"Went for grab and go breakfast at 9:20 this morning. Manager was just opening the cash register, and there was no pastry yet. Nothing was ready for customers. This is the third time I have gone for grab and go breakfast, and they were not open for business. I do not think this place will be a success. There is NO  consistency in food, service, or anything else. The building would be better off as an art studio. The people running it have NO concept of how to run a restaurant.

{"text":"We live in Vegas and came to BC for the Spring Jamboree. We decided rather than eat at the event that we would try this new local place. It looks so inviting, fantastic atmosphere and you can see the care that went into decorating. The staff was very attentive and the service above par. Next comes the bad part: My husband ordered the house special burger (medium rare). It sounded great on the menu, a patty with beef and lamb, orange salsa, feta cheese and Kalamata olives. I ordered the Salade Niçoise - seared ahi tuna, with fingerling potatoes, hard boiled egg, Kalamata olives and asparagus. The food arrived. My husband's burger was barely seared and raw and he said it was pretty much flavorless. The side of garlic fries were limp and under cooked. The tuna on my salad was not seared, but fully cooked and the salad had little to no dressing. We ordered a pineapple mojito from the bar - the best part of the entire meal. I read the other two reviews of the place here and they raved about the food. I don't know what's up, new chef maybe, but the opposite was true of our meal. Nice try Scratch House, but I don't think we will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, and the food was tasty. They had a special menu for Easter, prices in line with their normal menu -- which is quite pricy but not outrageous. Amazing to me that they had run out of some foods -- including bread-- just after they opened for dinner; guess they had a large lunch crowd! We enjoyed it enough that we are looking forward to returning though we couldn't afford to do so frequently."}
{"text":"So glad to find a gluten-free friendly spot for my hubby with celiac. He had a salmon Caesar salad and it was delish. Also the caprese was GF.  My kids enjoyed the fish and chips.  Lovely wine choices and my daughter enjoyed a frappuccino"}
{"text":"First this place is incredibly clean.  The staff are very sweet and attentive especially Melissa.  The food was top notch and the pricing is competitive to the quality of the food.  If I come back to area I will make sure I stop on by and get the chorizo paninni."}
{"text":"The service is first-class . They also were very nice to my dog. they gave  her complimentary burger  lol. I Ordered the ahi salad which I liked. If you get a chance try it."}
{"text":"The meals served us were incredibly delicious.  One in our party ordered sea bass, one ordered salmon, one lemon chicken, and one chicken penne Alfredo.  Our server was attentive.  The ambiance was quiet, but not uncomfortable.  The new decor is classy.  Thank you, Scratch House, for a beautifully designed meal."}
{"text":"Had the Coq au Vin. I was very disappointed. The server told me how wonderful the wine sauce would be. What wine sauce. Not very tasty chicken on mashed  potatoes that were ok, surrounded be tough tasteless mushrooms. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! My husband had the eggs with smoked salmon. The salmon was perfect! I had the French toast. Reminded me of a fabulous bread pudding! With fresh fruit. Delicious!  They also have homemade apple sausage. Very good and a bit sagey. The bloody Mary and espresso martini are excellent!  They take great pride In their Coffee and espressos. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"After doing the Hoover Dam tour we were looking for something more interesting than souvenir shop food and boy did we find it.  In nearby Boulder city the Scratch House is a stylish and inviting open air restaurant with delicious food at a reasonable price.  We had a late lunch that really hit the spot.  With a wide sampling of the menu everyone in our party found their food delicious and plentiful.  From the salmon ceasar salad to the chicken fried steak to the mouthwatering club sandwich several in our party expressed their delight with their selections.  The hamburgers were hand fomed, thick and delicious. The salmon on the ceasar salad was juicy and tender and at a better price than I pay for a lesser salad at home. It was also the first time I've ever seen my picky 13 year old eater finish an entire meal, much less an entire steak and side of fries.  She also loved their cream soda. My surley teen left in a much better mood than when she arrived.  The serviice was prompt and friendly even though we were there at an off time between lunch and dinner service.  If we are ever back in Boulder City I know we will stop back.  Good food and a lovely stylish atmosphere at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Read the reviews - can't assume they are all legit these days - frankly some sounded like they were written by same person and seemed a bit over blown- but this place was good. Service friendly and very attentive at lunchtime. In a sea of chain restaurants and uninspiring diners, this restaurant offers a refreshingly different option. Very appealing menu - would have liked to try a dinner but we're only there for lunch then back on the road. Corned beef sandwich while the meat was a bit chewy it was delicious, especially paired with the slaw and toasted marble rye. Husband really liked the chicken wrap- corn a nice addition. Kudos to the owner for the enticing menu, nice servers, attractive setting."}
{"text":"Second time we've been here. Both times service was stressed. This time the cream for my coffee curdled. I had to keep asking for : more coffee/ more Splenda. There are no salt n pepper on the table- had to ask. My water was never refilled and I was very thirsty! I don't eat potatoes/ and so I requested double vegetables/ I got 2 broccoli sprigs- 2 carrot sprigs/ a few mushrooms. Another lady sent her samon back to chef to cook it longer. We won't go back! For the cost of gormet food- it's not worth it- they need classy waiters- better service- this was a Sunday night/ oh yes/ waitress spilled coffe on our menu- never changed it out- yuk"}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times since they have opened and every time was superb!  The food, the ambiance and the service!  Definitely our new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Good gravy! No, I mean it. REALLY good gravy. Enjoyed brunch on the covered patio. Excellent biscuits, potatoes, homemade jams and ketchup, soft boiled eggs -- the works! Friendly staff who are proud to work here. Right across from the hotel."}
{"text":"The only reason this is a  five star review is more aren't allowed by yelp. I had the best oatmeal I've ever had and the best latte I've ever tasted. One of us had the French toast her best ever. The fish and chips were excellent and one of us had the Caesar salad and another had a hamburger. This meal and the great service were worth the drive from Las Vegas. This is one place you should never drive by without stopping."}
{"text":"No kinks, all class. From the initial soft opening two months ago, my fifth visit to this European-styled gem confirms swift ascent into a consistent craft of über hip culinary awesomeness.   Succulent Dungeness crab cakes were generously portioned and impeccably prepared, nestled upon mixed micro greens with an off the hook sweet chile sauce...made in house, from scratch...and thus having the perfect juxtaposition of mildly spicy and subtly sweet flavors we immediately found addictive.   Fresh salmon, pan seared to its exact moment of doneness, was perched upon a bed of sautéed baby asparagus, artfully presented with an extraordinary, carrot orange purée and a creamy béarnaise for succulent swirling. We found the Chilean sea bass equally compelling, with its tarragon-scented crushed new potatoes and crayfish beurre blanc.   We capped our meal with the most richly flavored, and oh so creamy cappuccinos; the barista execution is definitely top drawer. Service was dynamic and flawless on a full house Friday night, with the dining room's floor-to-ceiling glass swung open to inviting, patio seating beyond.   The owners have crafted an eclectic interior: an exposed wood beam ceiling framed by geometric black metalwork; a pair of enormous and stunning Art Deco paintings; center stage viewing kitchen and mesmerizing indigo lighting surrounding the bar (where we anticipate the addition of some unique craft cocktails, please;)) Altogether a welcome and much-needed addition to Boulder City's culinary offerings. Bravo, Scratch House!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our motorcycle ride to the Hoover Dam and By-Pass Bridge. We were promptly seated and our waitress explained everything. The craft root-beer was awesome! Our food arrived quickly, was fresh and enjoyed by all. The wrap was tasty. I like my garlic fries with ore garlic but not a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Really a hidden gem offering very high quality dining in an unlikely location.  Don't miss the sticky toffee pudding."}
{"text":"Food was amazing - service was horrible. Hopefully they are still working out the new restaurant jitters. I will give it another shot but gonna be a while."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch. Servers were attentive & friendly. I had a spinach & feta egg white omelet that was wonderful (5 star alone..should have stopped there) my husband had the biscuits & gravy that were not wonderful at all. The menu described his dish as flaky biscuits with country sausage gravy. There were actually 2 cornbread muffins cut in half with a sweet tasting gravy on top. When he questioned the sever they said that's how's it was supposed to be....cooks are from Romania & they have a different interpretation of things. It looked to us like they were out of biscuits and made a shortcut. A biscuit is a biscuit no matter where you are from & we know what a muffin is! Needless to say he didn't like it but ate it because he was hungry. Bill was wrong but corrected. Would not make a special trip back for second try."}
{"text":"Terrible! Only left 1 star because im required to put a star to post but reality is i give absolutely NO stars. We came in for Brunch today and were very excited as the venue looked amazing. We placed our order and waited over 45 minutes for our food. Other tables whom had arrived after us received their food before us one of which has ordered the same thing I did. My father is a chef (whom was also with me) and says he has never taken that long for what we ordered. Three simple plates and still weren't done in 45 minutes? Thats ridiculous. Paid for our drinks and left. The chef and manager did not even bother to apologize. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was a great little place we found as we were attending the Boulder City Art Festival.  We had a share plate as we weren't very hungry and dessert. Service was great and our server Cassandra was awesome.  Food was decent and we will be back.  The only misstep was we saw/heard the chef yelling at a server (not our server). Having worked in the food service industry I am aware that happens but for your customer to see/hear that isn't good.  That should happen in private and not so a customer can hear. I realize the place wasn't busy but that should never occur."}
{"text":"Horrible service and overprice food. Found cellophane on my churrizo in my antipasto. Almost choked. When I brought it to the manager's attention, she sent the chef out to argue with me. No apology, no apathy..Nada! I will never return."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for coffees !!! Very good and tasty :-)), staff is super friendly, dog's friendly, they fed our puppy with fresh liver.. We will definitely come back for dinner and try the French Ratatouille of Silviu Briceag !  Good place !"}
{"text":"Long wait since they just opened, so make a reservation.  Food was very much worth the wait.  Had the Foie Gras Burger and it was extraordinary!!  It's great to have a real restaurant in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"As the name implies, they make everything from scratch. They always have amazing specials that combine the weirdest ingredients to create an explosion of flavour you will have never tasted before.  My special had a steak with a soft boiled egg, sweet potato purée and ice cream. Crazy delicious! This is a food experience!"}
{"text":"service was sympathetic ( server pointed out that there was a comment card in w check)   and not \"bad\" got seated quickly for a sunday(seems most locals AVOID place) biscuits and gravy were described as flaky they were clumps not biscuits and crumbly not flaky! sauce was garden variety out of the can  main problem was fighting the numerous flies for your food.....4 flies around our table couldn't b shoed away...flies at corresponding tables.........I didn't even get to finish my brunch picking areas unflied lol  not a good experience just a waste of $25 hopefully the waitress stole the cash as a tip cause the restaurant didn't deserve it!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, beautiful atmosphere! I had the smoked salmon sandwich - best idea ever! The garlic fries could have used more garlic but then again, I just love garlic. Everything is made from scratch down to the ketchup. We just happened upon this place-it truly is a jewel!!"}
{"text":"Understanding & satisfying your customer's needs are the cornerstone of a successful business. Silviu lonut Briceag is the chef who stormed out of the kitchen to inform our table that the steak he cooked was \"perfect\" letting us know (in very loud tones) that we don't know how to order properly! What chef ever does such a thing to paying customers? However, Jamie the GM is professional and handled the \"problem\", none of us believe a word of her explanation, but she did take care of the horrible experience for us. We were all looking forward to being together and this so called 3 star michelin chef ruined our brunch! He has to go, the owners need to know he's been pretty much a problem since day one!"}
{"text":"Love the staff at Scratch House, and the coffee is amazing. I have had lunch and dinner, and they never disappoint. I know when they first opened, they had a few hiccups, but they have come a long way in a short amount of time. If you haven't checked them out yet, you really should! If they didn't hit the mark for you last time, give them another try! Scratch House is worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited the Scratch House on Feb 15, the 20th anniversary (long story) of our engagement.  We were surprised, and pleased to see the restaurant full on a Sunday evening, after Valentines Day.  Wife had crab cake app, me the sea scallops, both were excellent.  Wife had the lobster special and I had the filet mignon.  she loved the lobster, and my filet was prepared perfectly (I order mine Philadelphia Blue).  The waiter was quite helpful, and courteous, explaining that they were out of some items because of Valentines Day.  Restaurant was spotless, tables neatly set, and all of the staff friendly.  This will be our go to restaurant for most of our dinners out, especially with friends.  Beautiful interior, Art Deco - Modern."}
{"text":"The people of Boulder City deserve food just as upscale as anything on the strip--so says the owner of Scratch.  I had the filet mignon, to compare to last night's on the strip.  Voila!  Just as succulent!  Everything is prepared from scratch--hence the name.  Each dish is a work of art, and I was treated like royalty.  5 stars."}
{"text":"This review would have gotten fewer stars if my salmon soft scramble was not as delightful and delicious as it was.  Effort is the key here.  As a regular diner, I recognize the desire of the staff, the menu and the decor is to be its best and it's missing the mark as the focus seems to be on all the wrong things.  First, we were told we weren't able to sit because they had to first polish the glasses and silver before we could sit at tables that were already cleared with empty seats.  My mother was shaky standing with her cane so I asked if there was a place where she could sit.  It was then they ushered us to our table.  Needless to say, when the glasses finally arrived, they glistened, and were left empty as we waited for water and subsequent refills.  Our sparkling silver came much later...long after we had to wait to order.  As other reviewers noted...the staff appeared completely bewildered and lacking in direction.  As we sat ready to order we struggled to even see any servers...at one point we counted two (too few to cover the number of tables - many of which were empty) - and those two were impossible to make eye contact.  There was what appeared to be one buser, and he moved incredibly slow, and seemed challenged at doing his job - setting tables without cleaning the tops.  He could have been leveraged to also pour water (which was very delicious, seemingly filtered).  The bar was covered in dirty dishes, bottles and trash.  Finally, a server that we were told \"inherited us\" was very good, but it still didn't stop us noticing that a number of tables seated after us were already eating.  I empathized with the chef who was yelling for servers to pick up their orders - it caused many of us to giggle and make eye contact with one another.  The restaurant should have runners to bring the food to the tables.  There are a number of other amusing anecdotes from our table as well as lore from BC locals about the service here and soup that was \"too cold to even bathe in\", but I will save those gems to be captured here via their own respective keyboards."}
{"text":"This is the BEST restaurant I've eaten at in a very long time! I live in Scottsdale, AZ -- supposedly the food mecca of the southwest -- but I'm continuously let down by start up restaurants that are all talk but can't deliver on the food. If Scratch House opened up there, they would quickly rise to the top. We began our meal with the soup of the day, gazpacho and it was amazing! I lived in Spain so I know gazpacho and this version is smooth, refreshing and delicious. I ordered the Sea Bass, which is hands down the best sea bass I ever tasted. My husband had the ribeye - amazing! The kids enjoyed home-made marinara pene and devoured it. We were anxious to try their home-made desserts which also didn't disapoint. The kids were happy with their freshly churched vanilla ice cream and my husband and I enjoyed the strawberry cassoulet and cheesecake. The owner was very generous with proseco on the house and ice cream for the kiddos. Our waitress, Melissa, was a gem. -- local historian and professional attendant. If I were coming back to this area, this would be a priority stop. I wish Scratch House the much success it sure deserves,"}
{"text":"They tout the ribeye, however, medium rare came as rare with unmelted white fat. Short rib burger was tasty, but caramelized onion a little too sweet. Wait staff was excellent, very attentive with good recommendations - very familiar with the menu. Overall a tasty meal and I will give them another go. If your in BC this is probably the premium spot."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. I ordered pasta here and the sauce was runny and tasted like it came out of a can. They don't give you much either. I thought the name should be matching the food that comes out of the kitchen but it was completely the opposite. I never return food because afraid the cook might spit in it but I felt I had no choice. I got their fish and chips instead. Not impressed with that either. Was soaked in grease. I know it's suppose to be fried but it looked like they just left it in grease. I didn't end up eating much of it cause I was completely grossed out."}
{"text":"Yelp-ed this place while visiting Hoover Dam...wow!  Such a great vibe here and AWESOME food.  Service was very welcoming...really, really great meal!"}
{"text":"Great food, even better service. Lori was our server and she was amazing. Her recommendations were spot on! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, hoping each time the service would get better, but it hasn't. So far the food has been good (except a brownie- gummy in the middle and very hard), but it always takes ridiculously long for my food to arrive and even longer for the check! Maybe it's new restaurant kinks that need to be worked out- we'll see."}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING!!!!  We brought my father in law there for his birthday. ..we were unaware they closed the kitchen from 3pm until 5pm...that giving them the time to prepare for dinner.   We walked in a little after 3pm. The owner happened to be sitting outside and heard how disappointed we were. ..he not only went and asked the cooks if they would be willing to cook lunch for us but also bought my father in laws lunch. ..ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! !!!  The food was mouth watering. .can't wait to go back for dinner"}
{"text":"This Restaurant is truly unique in a good way.  The service was excellent.  I had the Fish & Chips.  It was absolutely fabulous.  The batter was light and crispy golden brown.  It wasn't saturated with oil.  It was better than Crown & Anchors and that is saying a lot.    The best compliment to this meal was the béarnaise foam that they serve with it in lieu of tartar sauce.  Make sure when they serve it to you to mix it up with a spoon to get the delicious briny capers and other goodies at the bottom of the sauce.  It was so velvety and good that I ended up dipping my Chips in it as well.  Fries for us American folks.  Homemade and Golden Brown as well.    Just a fabulous experience.  Thank you Scratch House.  Good, fresh, made from Scratch food is worth the wait.  I'll be back with my friends."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to have lunch today, I decided to check out Scratch House even though there are a few not-so-good reviews. I was not disappointed. Let me repeat that: I was not disappointed.   I'm a huge fan of good coffee, and some of my friends even tell me I'm a coffee snob, so when I first walked in and saw an espresso machine, a nice, clean espresso machine, I decided to chance it. So here I go with the questions to my server, Reanne: where do the beans come from, who roasts them, do you guys know what a real traditional macchiato is, etc. etc. etc. I got answers from my server that made me willing to give it a try... and I'm so glad I did! Cassie, the barista, made the most perfect macchiato I've had since I left the Pacific Northwest last September, nine months ago. The PNW knows how to do coffee, and so does this place. Whew! Now I can order lunch.  I had Silviu's Chef Salad (minus the croutons) and although the chicken was just a tad dry, overall, the salad was delicious. Candied tomatoes? Yum! Roasted pignolias? Perfect! Fresh greens, tasty tangerine vinegrette dressing. Yummy.  So now I think I need dessert. Guess what? They make their own ice cream here! As soon as Reanne said \"bacon salted caramel,\" I didn't hear any other flavors. Stop. Just stop right there. I'll have another macchiato and the bacon salted caramel ice cream. Thank you very much.   The ice cream was so delicious, my mouth still drools just thinking about it. Of course, I had to try some of it affogato-style (ice cream with espresso poured over) in my macchiato and wouldn't you know, that was even better than eating it by itself!  Chef! You need to add affogato to the dessert menu!  I know this place is still kind of new and I know it's had some less-than-good reviews. But I also know they're trying hard and I know the food was fresh and tasty and well-prepared. Give them a try. I hope you're not disappointed, and if you are, please give them some constructive feedback. They're a great addition to Boulder City and it would be awesome if they could be consistent enough to bring their ratings up."}
{"text":"Cute modern place in an old town.  Food and service was good. Would have been 4 stars but they were out of the featured Pinot Noir on the menu, ran out of the soup that they talked up and told us there was no desert menu when clearly they were serving sorbet in martini glasses to others (friends of the chef maybe?). Seems like a new place that just has to work out some kinks."}
{"text":"First time we've been here. We will definitely be back! We are always looking for a great restaurant for our get aways on our day off, and we just found another one. Probably one of the best burgers I have ever had. Seriously good! Our server Lori was a pleasure."}
{"text":"Amazing food, outstanding service. Brunch is amazing and their drinks selection is just fabulous !  We had the pleasure of having Melissa as our server. She is amazing! Explained each item to us and her recommendations were superb! We couldn't be happier with the attention we received.   This PET FRIENDLY restaurant has an outdoor area with a water bowl for puppies and Melissa brought fresh, cold water for our baby. We couldn't have asked for a better service.   I loved this restaurant, their drink menu is outstanding and Melissa is the best server we've met so far. TOP CLASS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch at Scratch House with our friends yesterday. Here are our thoughts.  Loved the fact we could enjoy the outdoors even though we were seated indoors. Furniture and decor were very nice. Staff terrific. We were greeted by the General Manager who made a point of telling us their primary goal is have guests leave with a full tummy and a smile.  I'm vegan. While the menu is not vegan friendly I challenged the server and chef to prepare a lovely vegan meal for me. Our server was excited to meet the challenge and collaborate with the chef.  My husband is English. Hearing the chef was trained in London, my husband opted for the Fish and Chips.  Our friends ordered the home made soup, a Atlantic Salmon sandwich and Waldorf Salad.  None of us were disappointed!    Our server and our busser were very nice. We were chatting about the Fawlty Towers episode with the Waldorf Salad and our busser chimed in with a line or two to add to the fun  After lunch we all ordered espresso drinks. Not only did they taste delicious, the young barista did a wonderful job of the presentation.  She had such a lovely personality too.   Our lunch was delicious, the atmosphere conducive to having a great time, and the service terrific.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The crab cakes were good. It seemed like the tomatoes in the caprese salad were bought at the local grocery store. Light pink watery no flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! We live in Vegas, came out here and thought we'd stop...well worth the stop!!!"}
{"text":"I ate there 3 times, hit and miss.  1st time: Wife had chicken alfredo very good, I had the NY steak med rare, they served it butterfly cut it and  med well. 2nd time, wife had the bean soup excellent, I had fish and chips, fish was slimy. returned it, chef came and gave me instruction on cooking fish.(it still sucked.) 3rd time breakfast. I had biscuts and gravy, biscuts were excellent, gravy was bland. Wife had omlet, made from rubber. Great location, clean, unfortunatly if they are still in bussiness Novemberok u 2015 it will suprize me."}
{"text":"went there on Wednesday for lunch this place is unbelievable, in the fact that their corned beef was so dry it suck up what's left of Lake Mead, on a Reuben. Had no flavor no seasoning no nothing, hard bread and limp french fries. servers decided to ignore me because I was by myself and didn't look like I had enough money. well never fear I won't be back there again"}
{"text":"My family took me here for dinner on Mother's Day - it was awesome.  I had the Sea Bass; probably the best I've ever had.  The wine was excellent and the service was great.  I'll be a return customer."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the Scratch House for dinner to celebrate Valentine's Day. Upon our arrival we were promptly greeted and seated.  We started out our meal with a few drinks. Then we ordered the crab cake appetizer. The crab cake was moist and flavorful.  For our meals we ordered the Sea Bass and Filet! Both of these were delicious! Perfectly cooked and served quickly. It was obvious that the chef's took great care in making sure the items were very nicely presented and cooked to perfection!   The ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic! There was indoor, outdoor, and bar seating! The staff was great and the service was excellent. We were approached by the managers to confirm that everything was to our liking and that we were satisfied!  It is definitely worth the drive to Boulder City to visit The Scratch House~"}
{"text":"Ok i worked for this guy. He hired a idioy stubborn romanian chef and manafwer who thought they were gods fify and treated people like shit well ofcourse they are unemployes and blithering their way to get jobs , thirty uears in this business and never have I been treated soooo badly. They need to deport these assholes who thought they were above and beyond god, treated everyone like shit!!!!!    The owner and his boyfriend were so oblivious to this shit they could not see their restaurant being run into the ground. I have spoken to many of the Directors in Vegas and told them do not hire these Romanian assholes"}
{"text":"I have visited twice now, the first time much better than the last.  Last night was all around bad.  The service was slow, 3 hours to complete dinner, the food was poor and the portions small.  I know our server was trying, but the rest of the staff seemed clueless.  I don't mind paying a good price for good food and service, but to have neither at portion sizes that left me hungry is unacceptable.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"Very nice new restaurant in Boulder City. Ambiance is quiet and modern. Service was very friendly. Melissa was super! Food was excellent, fresh and came quickly. Had the salmon rillette sandwich on marbled rye with a green salad. Very delicious. Will come back."}
{"text":"After my first visit here three months ago, I'm happy to say my dinner experience was delightful. Our server, William, was very friendly and helped me make my decision to have the Chilean sea bass. My dining companion had scallops and we shared the two. The scallops were good, I'd have liked to see a bit more sear on them as well as seasoning. The sea bass was perfectly cooked and the sauce very tasty. Potatoes served with it were just okay but there was enough going on that it was all enjoyable. We had dessert and I wish we had chosen the meringue because the sticky toffee we ordered was nothing special, the best part of which was the berry sauce.  Overall an experience which makes me want to come back again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! I'm so glad to see such a wonderful place open in Boulder City. We will certainly be back. We had the t-bone and cappuccino for dinner and topped it off with a chocolate brownie. Sounds basic- but let me assure you, it was exceptional. Grass-fed beef and organic veggies give this place real flavor. I have heard that the fish is fresh from net to table in less than 24 hours. Yum."}
{"text":"We went to scratch house for dinner several weeks ago. What can I say the meal was simply amazing!! The food was so beautifully presented and we had wine to match each course. And the service was impeccable. Can't wait to go again! Bravo Jared and Charles"}
{"text":"I give it three stars for effort, I understand what they are trying to do but now after my third visit I have to say they are really missing the mark.  Visits started a three weeks ago with Sunday brunch.  Five stars for the fresh Orange juice and coffee with baileys.  Staff all of them very nice, but very aquard with staff standing around you while your eating.  The scratch plater (meats, olives and greens) is nice when you ask for bread to go with it.  Set brunch menue just opened for the day and two main entrees not available.  Other option interesting but nothing special.   Steak and eggs seem to be the winner at our table.  Next just two weeks ago we tried dinner, we started with the scallops nicely cooked with a parsnip mash which we guessed because it is not explained when brought to table.  The teenager at the table orderied the $30 ribeye loved it, my son order the hamburger and was surprised with the flavor, but over cooked and way to much bun.  I ordered the risotto, mushroom risotto on the menue with arugula and truffle oil.  What I received was a unbelievabley bad.  The risitto had no flavor, and  was undercooked sticky mess, with mushrooms on top ( they had a little flavor) then not arugula but some sprout that the tend to use on everything and to much truffle oil trying to compensate for the flavorlus rissoto below it.  No question when they picked up the uneaten plate.    So now back again with another family member from LA. Want to make sue it's just not me.  Again we started with scratch platter, stopped one of the servers to explain what was on the plater this time, they almost got it right then we asked for bread to go with it.  Once again the teenager had the ribeye, she was happy, looked to be cooked to order.  Other adult ordered the strip, looked like the ribeye so verified before starting to eat. Blue cheese sauce was very thin like a salad dressing.  I went for something different and what I thought would be simple.  I had the honey lemon chicken with wild rice.  Glaze on the chicken and decorated around the plate was good, even the little mint pesto drizzled on the plate was nice, but that over cooked chicken breast that had to have been cooked earlier in the day and not even warmed up when plated  was sad.   The wild rice taste similar to the precook end packaged at Costco.  I don't mind paying more for a good meal, I have eaten at most of the top rated resturants on the strip and I like the thought of bringing this type of resturants to Boulder.  I hope they start putting as much effort into the quality of the dishes as the do the decorating of the plate."}
{"text":"The food here is always tasty but sometimes the service doesn't equate to the quality of the food. Everyone one is friendly but service isn't as smooth as it should be sometimes. The risotto is my favorite!  Today, I tried brunch here for the first time and had the eggs Benedict and biscuits and gravy. Biscuits and gravy was my favorite as well as the mimosas with fresh squeezed OJ!"}
{"text":"We reviewed our yelp app to choose our dining experience for last night. Scratch House seemed like a top contender,. So that's where we ended up.  The service was appropriate for the caliber of the restaurant.  I'll be brief in my critique....i ordered the sea bass.. It was good,.. It could have been seasoned with a bit of citrus and salt and absolutely should have been warmer!  Mr friends both had the Filet.. Med rare... One had the Diane sauce which was not like any Diane sauce that I've ever had,. It was more like canned mushroom soup. The other friend had the Bernaise sauce which was also lacking flavor and was served at a cool temperature. The Bernaise was sent back to the kitchen for reheating and was brought back and served exactly the same way. The head chef told our server that heating the sauce more would break down the components of the sauce. An alternative wasn't offered to my friend., So she ate some of the sauce. We left the restaurant discussing amongst ourselves how the head chef was looking at our table and shaking his head at us in a very condescending way. We won't be back., Too many choices are to be had!!!"}
{"text":"We saw the giant whisk on the roof and knew we had to stop in.  The ambiance is very cool. Its kind of country elegant.  We loved the fact that almost everything on their menu  is home made.  Jaquoia was our server and did a really great job. She was very personable.   We started with the brie cheese appetizer with cranberry sauce. It was good  but the menu didn't state it was fried. My wife being gluten free, couldnt try it.  I had the roast beef sandwich. You can't beat fresh baked bread. It was also good with a nice kick of horseradish in the slaw. I was expecting it to be medium or medium rare since most roast beef sandwiches are.  It had nice flavor though.The au jus was a great addition. The salad dressing tasted more lemon than tangerine.   She had the seared tuna. She ordered it well (yes, I know, she likes her fish over cooked) but it was rare. She ate it anyway.  The dressing on her salad was delicious.   We could tell it was recently opened because the the kitchen and wait staff were still gelling. It's not a bad thing. All new restaurants go through it.  With the absence of bussers and food runners, the servers have a lot to. We could see them running around because they were very busy. Getting our check took a while because she got a little bit overwhelmed.  I don't fault her for that. It's a new restaurant and they have to figure out how to schedule the staff.  In the end, we had a pleasant experience and think the restaurant will be successful and is a welcome business to Boulder City."}
{"text":"My British husband, who was a chippie (maker of fish & chips) in both London and America, gives the Scratch House fish and chips...five stars.   Was it easy to say Chef's F&C were better than his?  Of course not.  But we don't withhold the truth here on Yelp.  We tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Now, Eddie did mention that it's a French thing to add the orange rind and Brits prefer lemon, but so what.  The freshness and consistency of the fish, the crunch and flavor of the batter were just spot on.  And of course those fabulous chips cannot be beat.  So yes, it's true: Eddie could do no better.  Our customers who loved Eddie the Brit's Olde English Fish & Chips back in Bentonville, Arkansas are now on notice.  Come to Boulder City and bring your British appetite my friends.  Now as far as the horseradish, which was our original reason for returning to Scratch House, it was everything Eddie had been craving since coming to America in 2010.  He reports that it was real horseradish and tasted fresh.  Sounds simple, yet so hard to achieve.  Chef sat at the table with us to witness Eddie's first taste, and it was completely, absolutely, right."}
{"text":"We just ate breakfast again at Scratch House and enjoyed a leisurely and delicious brunch after the parade. We arrived a bit ahead of the post-parade rush, and the waitstaff was friendly and attentive to us. The chef even came out to answer a few questions about the menu, which was kind of him especially as it's a breakfast menu!   Their coffee is delicious and rich and my husband enjoyed his fresh-squeezed orange juice. He got the breakfast burrito with their house potatoes and a fresh baked biscuit on the side. The biscuits are fluffy and tender and the potatoes crisp and flavorful. I didn't get bit of his burrito, but it must have been good because it disappeared so quickly!  I ordered the french toast, which I highly recommend. It's more like custard than french toast, creamy, light and dotted with cream and fresh berries. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Melissa you're a GREAT touch to the restaurant!  We just loved you!  The food OMG.... I am a condiments person, but I did not need it this dine around. FANTASTIC EVERYTHING.  THANK YOU  for a great day!"}
{"text":"Update. Used to be four stars, excellent food, inexperienced staff, but trying, somewhat limited wine list. Most of the deduction was for the atmosphere. If I wanted to eat at McDonalds with the bright lights I would go to the golden arches. Mentioned 4x how bright the lights were, no one ever responded. Guess that's ok. However stopped in tonight for a martini and was charged $24.83. Yes it was Bombay Sapphire and Grey Goose vodka. Still seems excessive especially when I can walk across the street to Milos on Monday nights and get the same drink for $6. I think a fair price is somewhere in between the scratch house in my Milos. But the owner is never there which is somewhat of a faux pas for Boulder City. Guess that's why the place is so empty all the time. I will not go back. Should be renamed the shit house. Yes I am somewhat livid right now but wouldn't you be?"}
{"text":"Man am I full! I was not sure what to expect when I came to Scratch House. The reviews have been good and bad, but I was encouraged by many to try it out. My parents were in town from South Carolina. So, my family and I decided tonight that we should drive out to Boulder City to check it out. Firstly, let me say the place is new and they seem to be working some service issues out with some of the new staff. However, the place deserves five stars regardless of the small issues we had. The food is AMAZING! Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to have their palates checked. The chef and his staff do an amazing job. My wife has a very unique pickiness when it comes to food, and the chef was devoted to figure out how to make something that would make her happy. He was a success. The Brie appetizer is one of the most amazing things I have eaten, I would definitely recommend. I had the Salmon, all the other adults had the Chicken Alfredo. My kids had the cheese burger and the chicken tenders. The kids enjoyed their meals, my son particularly enjoyed the chicken tenders (he ate every one of them, he NEVER does that). The Salmon was phenomenal and perfectly cooked. Each side complemented perfectly and I enjoyed it very much. Everyone who had the Alfredo enjoyed it. We also had some sorbet, cheese cake, and salted caramel ice cream for desert. The coolest thing about this place is everything is made from scratch in the kitchen, even the ketchup. Everything has a unique taste that can only be found at this fantastic restaurant. My compliments to the chef on a job well done. Once they iron out the minimal service issues, I would honestly want to give this place six stars if I could. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, biscuits, homemade orange jam, homemade ketchup, attentive service, chef visited the table. Don't miss the scratch house eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Went back in for breakfast at the insistence of a friend. I actually wanted to return here after my first lousy experience because I was hoping it would improve with time.  It has.  Service was still super friendly (I was a little nervous the owner would recognize me after our less than cordial exchange) but everyone was great. The food was above average and more inline with the prices.   Hoping this remains consistent as this little town needs more good places to eat."}
{"text":"I don't like to post negative things however I think people should be made aware that this place is very different which some people might like. I have been a chef for 27 plus years so I will say I respect the chefs creativity wonderful but let your customers know. When I got me ceaser salad it was not a traditional Ceasar salad with anchovies and egg emulsion. It seemed like it was made with mayonnaise and it had bacon bits. You invented a new salad cool I didn't care for it. Please tell the waitress to let your customers know that it's different so we won't be disappointed. The homemade ketchup tasted like it had soy sauce in it I respect that you made it from scratch but swallow your pride and have a bottle of heinz available for someone that does not like it. Everybody is different I've had people complain about dishes that I have put my heart and soul into. But at the end of the day it's all about making your customers happy and wanting to come back right.. I think the food was good and I do not want to give a bad review. But just let people know that the dishes are not traditional or do like I did when I cooked french food have your traditional dishes and another section that says chefs spin where you can change it up a little bit but let people know. I did not complain when I was there.  And I will give it another try one day thanks and I wish you the best for your business."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times since they opened, and in our opinions they continue to improve.  Brunch is very good.  The last dinner we enjoyed was also very good - we had the caprese salad and the sea bass (hope it was sustainably sourced!).  I think that they perhaps could add a couple more salads or perhaps a vegan or vegetarian option. I do understand that they have to meet demands of the visitors to town, but for the locals that regularly dine out it would be nice to have a few more healthy options.  They have a nice wine list and good specialty cocktails. We like the ambiance here, especially in the cooler months when the doors can be kept open and you can comfortably sit outside."}
{"text":"What a great find! We were sat seconds after arriving and our food was delivered promptly.  I ordered the mushroom burger... delicious!  Had a mushroom sauce, some sort of tomato relish and tons of mushrooms.  It came with some seasoned fries and homemade ketchup. .. that's right! Everything here is made from scratch.  Daughter got the french toast, again, yummy,  with freshly whipped cream and fresh blueberries and strawberries. Hubby got the salmon sandwich which was also great. The atmosphere was perfect but what stood out was the service: from the waitress to the really nice manager ( who came to check on us a couple times) to the chef who sent my daughter a delicious brownie with (you guessed it) homemade vanilla ice cream,  theses people know the value of customers, how to please them and how to make them want to come back for more! You earned our business and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just celebrated my birthday at Scratchhouse and it was wonderful. I highly recommend eating here. The food us beautifully presented. The wine list is lovely. The desserts are amazing. Try the red wine sauce with the steak--excellent."}
