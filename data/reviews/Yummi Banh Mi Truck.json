{"text":"Just had my first experience with Yummi Banh Mi (food truck)! I ordered the Lemongrass Chicken Bowl! Can I say, YUMMI! It was fantastic! From the deliciously seasoned chicken, the fresh cucumbers, carrots, cilantro and jalapeños to the delightful taste of the sticky rice at the bottom! The light lemongrass vinaigrette just brought the marriage of this delicious bowl together!! Thanks for a Yummi lunch! Until we meet again!"}
{"text":"Ate the BBQ pork , awesome , excellent mix of veggies on it. Caught them at Southpark Eats, Wednesday ."}
{"text":"I am always a fan of banh mi and this version is pretty darn good. I had the banh mi rice bowl with bbq pork which is a pretty nifty way to eat it. It's a very generous bowl of rice, meat, and veggies. The pork was yummy with great flavor and the veggies were very good as well. I wish the rice were stickier, it was a little too much on the soft side. If they perfect the rice, I would give it a solid five starts.  I also wish I hadn't gotten the jalepenos because they are quite hot (duh) and if they get on your fingers, don't rub your nose or your eyes because it hurts like hell. The limeade was very tasty too and goes great with the meal. The guy who owns the truck is a super nice guy, very personable and welcoming. It was fun to order our food and then go sit in the park and eat. I think he has a win here."}
{"text":"So, I'm no Banh Mi expert, but I'm in love with this food truck. We were at Sycamore Brewing Sunday afternoon, Yummi Banh Mi was parked outside. This was exactly what I wanted on a Sunday afternoon, and a nice compliment to my beer. The wait was short (yay) and the food was prepared timely (double yay). 

I ordered the bbq pork banh mi sandwich (8 dollars), and it was well worth it!. The bread was amazing, it tasted fresh and was nice and crusty on the outside. All the toppings that come with it (jalepenos, pickled carrots, cilantro) were fresh and tasty! Oh and how could I forget the pork?? It was sooo delicious. When you hear of \"bbq pork\" (at least in the south), you usually think of pulled pork. Well at least I do...This is NOT that. It's more like grilled pork pieces (like the pork I've gotten at Vietnamese restaurants). SO SO GOOD. 

 Please park outside of my house and make me sandwiches. I seriously could eat this sandwich everyday.. 

I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but everything looked good from what I've seen!"}
{"text":"1st time eating Banh Mi and it was really good! I chased down the food truck spot after getting a Yelp email.  The BBQ Pork could've had more meat in the sandwich though, and I wish it also came with onions.  The flavours blended perfectly & that hidden gem (Jalapeño) really made the sandwich POP! Try a refreshing Chrysanthemum Tea with it!"}
{"text":"Yummi Banh Mi delivers! I'm a Yummi Bahn Mi fan! I'm a banh mi fan in general. I make banh mi at home. I eat banh mi whenever I see it.

I couldn't find a reason to knock off a star if I tried. The flavors are great, the portions are abundant and the freshness make for a clean and tasty bahn mi. 

I've only had their BBQ pork and lemongrass pork on my several visits...so that's all I can really review. Every time I've had them...I wished they were something I could eat daily. The service is quick and friendly...and the prices rival other food trucks.

Try: bringing a friend

Avoid: missing out on this great food truck"}
{"text":"Excellent! I had their lemongrass chicken bahn mi at food truck Friday and it was exactly what I was hoping for. Their sandwiches pack more meat than other bahn mi sandwich shops around Charlotte. The bread was perfect, nice and crispy and just enough to hold it together. Meat was flavorful and well cooked. Veggies were perfect and fresh, balanced it all out."}
{"text":"After hearing and reading rave reviews about Yummi Bahn Mi - I finally tracked them down (only a block away from my office, parked @ Element Uptown Apts). The bread was overly toasted but it's not a bad or overly derivative recreation of bahn mi, though not remotely close to the best available in Charlotte. A cold cut version with pâté would do wonders for them in attracting people who enjoy authentic bahn mi. At almost $9 after tax, (the typical price being 4-5 dollars) and absolutely emotionless service, I would never chase them down to give them my business."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Way better than Lee's. The protein is grilled fresh and served sizzling. Try out the BBQ Pork or Lemongrass Beef! Definitely the ONLY vietnamese Banh Mi truck around the Queen City."}
{"text":"My favorite food truck in Charlotte, along with the dumpling lady !  Excellent BBQ pork rice bowl is a healthier option than most at food truck rallies and the ingredients are so fresh and delicious!!"}
{"text":"I visited this truck at the Southpark Eats Alternative Wednesday food truck fest (off Fairview at Piedmont Row Dr. South - tons of nearby parking!). 
Lemongrass beef Banh Mi was DELICIOUS - great flavor in beef and sauce - a little kick but not too spicy. Baguette was outside crisp and inside chewy - as it should be. Mine was sans pickled daikon (allergic) and jalapeños (don't like) but had plenty of cucumber and cilantro. 
My coworker got the lemongrass chicken bowl with a bonus cracked egg & it looked wonderful. She said it was tasty and not spicy. 
Note: we got to trucks relatively early yet I got the last order of lemongrass beef. 
Definitely give Yummi Banh Mi a try."}
{"text":"They have the best Bahn Mi, I got the BBQ pork. u can get it as spicy as u want. I had been chasing them for a while and never got to try them. I am glad i did. it was worth it. My GF got the lemon grass beef rice bowl and loved it. I had a taste and thought it was awesome. WE got seconds even though we were stuff b/c it was so good."}
{"text":"Of course the word to sum this place up is yummy! I have had this food truck twice now and it does NOT disappoint. Boyfriend and I have tried the Lemongrass Pork & Lemongrass Chicken Bahn Mi's and they were both so fresh and delicious. 

Check this food truck out if you can."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite trucks in the qc serves up Vietnamese sandwiches (baguettes garlic mayo, cukes, carrots peppers), rice bowls (rice cukes carrots peppers and cilantro) and tacos.  They are quick and the sandwiches are very filling and the baguette is always so fresh and chewy.  They do a great job of  providing well seasoned flavorful meats and I think on my first few visits I would always get the chicken until they guy taking my order mentioned that the bbq pork was the best and he was so right on that recommendation.  I now only order the bbq pork rice bowl or the bbq pork sandwich and it is always amazing."}
{"text":"These dudes can make some awesome food.  I've had the lemongrass beef sandwich, but I've found their rice bowls to be the sweet spot.   Every time I see them at southpark eats alternative they get me in their line."}
{"text":"Amazing ... Fresh, tasty, and packed with flavor and spice. The jalapeños are very hot (I enjoyed it). I got the bbq pork sandwich with a fried egg! Definitely would get it again. The fried egg really brings it together. Yummy. The ingredients tasted fresh and the sandwich is a big size. Definitely filled me up!"}
{"text":"They were at sugar creek brewery. 

Got the bbq pork banh mi which was really good. Could have used some more veggies and pate. 

The guy taking the order could have been more friendly...

But food was really good and they brought it to me when I was sitting inside so I didn't have to wait outside for it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite food trucks in Charlotte! I always get the Rice bowl with BBQ pork, sometimes with an egg sometimes without. The BBQ pork has a gear flavor and you get a good portion of rice. I want to try the sandwiches and tacos but right now I'm stuck on the rice bowl !!"}
{"text":"When your name's Yummi, you gotta bring it... and they do. Full disclosure: I've only ever had Peculiar Rabbit's banh mi, which I LOVED, and then they took it off the menu. So, I tried Earl's Grocery's version. That's all I'll say about that.

Enter Yummi Banh Mi Truck! The fella and I went to Sugar Creek Brewery on a Wednesday evening, pretty much solely to stalk the truck. I got the BBQ pork banh mi ($8), crossed my fingers and waited for them to bring it into the brewery. It was divine!!! Finally, delicious banh mi!! The fella got the lemongrass tacos ($8). I wish I could tell you what he said about them, but I was too busy inhaling mine to care.

That said, the only reason I didn't go full 5 stars was because the fella's taco portions were tiny. I was glad I got the sandwich because I'd still be starving if I got the tacos, and considering they were the same price, you'd think they'd be about the same size. Also, I'd love some side options with the sammich."}
{"text":"Lemongrass chicken sandwich and lemongrass chicken bowl. The bowl was definitely the better option of the two, the lemongrass chicken is basiy
Chicken with teriyaki sauce on it, I don't see how that's even close to the chicken I've had on any other previous banh mi. Also I agree, the price point is a little steep for the quality that you get, especially when there are other better Vietnamese sandwiches all over charlotte for much cheaper."}
{"text":"My experience for this truck was was horrible, it was at a asian festival, super hot weather and a long line! I stayed in line and even paid for my food, waited a long a time standing outside in the heat! The couple in front of us waited longer, eventually the female fainted from the heat and the ambulance came. I then got impatient and went to see what was taking forever, to find out that no one was even cooking in the truck! I asked for a refund, the guy that was taking the order and cash was rude and had attitude about refunding my money. Luckily, another guy that was standing in line waiting to pay decided to pay me for my food. I will never eat at this truck or give them any of my money."}
{"text":"Got the chicken banh mi on a french style roll and it was deeeelish. I was afraid the bun was going to be too hard and hurt the roof of my mouth, but no, they were soft, flaky and wonderful. I asked for some dressing on the side and dipped my sandwich in it which made it even better! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Very fresh, very fast, very tasty food. I had the pleasure of trying this truck at the food truck rally at my job today ( Whitehall Eats at Whitehall Business park).

My rice bowl came with grilled or seared chicken with lemongrass atop a bed of perfectly sticky white rice, dressed with cilantro, jalapeño slices, slice cucumber and daikon. 

The flavors were amazing, and if you're hesitant to try new things, this is the dish from this trucks menu you should start with. I also recommend using the sriracha sauce they have available near the condiments. Great portion size too, you could technically make this less than $10 dish two meals."}
{"text":"Initially, I was hooked on the sandwiches from Yummi Banh Mi. Then I purchased their Vietnamese BBQ pork rice bowl. Why did I neglect this bowl for so long? Lol...The meat was well-seasoned....they gave me enough jasmine rice and veggies. The food truck staff asked me if I wanted to add the egg on top ( yolk uncooked), but I'm not gangsta like that...not yet. I definitely recommend Yummi Banh Mi and their rice bowls as well!!!"}
{"text":"Epic banh mi sandwiches. Hoping that they come into Plaza Midwood area often. Great BBQ pork banh mi sandwich with pâté."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Yummi Banh Mi food truck I am never disappointed. The lemongrass pork banh mi is my favorite of all the sandwiches. I have not ordered the rice bowls but will the next time they are here at this building. The sandwiches are so delicious and full of flavor. The service is friendly and fast. I could easily eat more then just one sandwich. Might have to order two next time, the second one might last until dinner (no promises). If you like food with flavor and great service check out this food truck."}
{"text":"Tried this version of bahn mi on food truck Friday. I've had le's bahn mi, which
Is super, so expectations are high. I ordered the regular sandwich and I must say, it was very good. As good as Mr. Le? I don't think so. Plus, they charged almost triple what Le's does. Don't get me wrong, the food was very good, but not up to snuff."}
{"text":"As a Vegetarian, it's rare that I find a veggie banh mi. I highly recommend the Pan-Fried Tofu Bahn Mi or Rice Bowl. Both options are very flavorful to the last bite!"}
{"text":"Someone at work told me I NEEDED to try these sandwiches and I am glad I did. They come every Friday to Gateway Village and I have them for lunch almost every Friday. Seriously delicious."}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered what it's like to enjoy lemongrass chicken in a rice bowl? (No? Just me?). Well, you can get to try it at Yummi Banh Mi Truck, just follow them on social media. The truck is everywhere. The bowl was satisfying, and can be shareable ( I was starving and I didn't share it). 


Five Yelps."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price! I love getting the rice bowl personally.  I would highly recommend that you try it at least once."}
{"text":"Best food truck in Charlotte! Their flavors are so well balanced -- sweet and spicy, soft and crunchy... We love the bahn mis and rarely order anything else. We've tried the rice bowls and tacos, both good but do yourself a favor and just get the sandwich! The BBQ Pork is probably our fave but I'm also a big fan of the lemongrass tofu. In case great food wasn't enough, the guys running the truck are top notch, too! Some of the friendliest in the business."}
{"text":"Hey Wow! A Vietnamese Food Truck!  I saw this truck parked outside of the new Sycamore Brewery recently and being the food truck fan I am, I had to try them.

Basically you choose your protein - chicken, beef, tofu and a few other options and select your vessel - of either a roll (Banh Mi), Taco, or Bowl.  Being health conscious (except for the beer), I went with a tofu bowl.  It came with cucumbers, carrots, daikon, rice and what I assume was fish sauce.

For a food truck, it was decent food.  It was better when I added Sirracha sauce. It really needed the heat.  Still not bad for a first experience with this truck. And definitely a nice addition to the local food truck scene."}
{"text":"I'm currently staying in Levine Children's Hospital with my son. We've been here (on and off) for five months. This means I've had plenty of time to try the food in Charlotte and it goes without saying that there is a ton of it. This food truck is my favorite place I've tried so far. The food is amazing. It's delicious,  very fresh and very visually appealing as well. What stands out as much as the food though is the service. The people that work on this truck are genuinely nice and fun to talk to. In fact, last time I ate here my card got declined for some reason and the young lady told me that I could just pay for it next time I came back. All the food is great but I recommend the lemon grass beef rice bowl. Even though I'm usually more of a chicken man...*bagok*"}
{"text":"The staff at the window and the chefs behind the curtain are all INCREDIBLE! fresh food, best Banh mi I've ever had. Great prices too-- the sandwich size is no joke. Tia is our favorite!"}
{"text":"Confession: I'm pretty much obsessed with these guys and their truck. How could you not be? Solid food and a truck with a giant Asian Pac Man on it? Sign me up all day.

My first Yummi Banh Mi experience was during a NoDa FAM event and the line was a mile long. Okay, maybe it wasn't a mile. I have poor depth perception. But, it was long and a long wait for food. This was back when they were first starting. Add to that: everyone wanted to try out the cool looking new truck. I remember being annoyed and thinking this better be worth it. I went with one of the rice bowls. It didn't look like a lot of food until you started eating, but tt was so filling and delicious. I was hooked. 

So what should you order? I don't think you can go wrong with any of it. I've had the rice bowls, tacos, and the banh mi sandwiches. The BBQ pork and the lemongrass options are all delicious. There is also tofu, if you're into that kind of thing. It's hard for me to order now because I really do like them all. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Everyone who works on the truck is super nice. 

How to find them? Follow them on the social medias. They post their schedule each week. Congrats to Scott on all his success so far. The Observer just did a great story on him and the truck a couple weeks ago. Nice to see good people doing well."}
{"text":"Not the best banh mi. Parking is ridiculous. Went out of my way to try these guys but was disappointed. I will gladly pay a lot of money for a good sandwich but this didn't cut it. It's a different take on the banh mi sandwich but I think the original version tastes way better."}
{"text":"As the name suggests the Banh Mi is yummy!  Had the lemon grass chicken for lunch recently and loved it. The bread was as it should be - crusty on the outside, soft on the inside. The chicken was cut up into small pieces and seasoned beautifully. The pickled dikon was the perfect topping. It's a bit pungent (like cabbage?) so some of my co workers complained when I brought it back into the office to eat, but that won't prevent me from returning!"}
{"text":"Right now this is one of my top 3 food trucks in Charlotte. I've tried these guys a few times so far. I keep running into them at Bulldog Beer & Wine. I really like the bbq pork Banh Mi sandwich. Great flavors and I love the crispy veggies. If I had any complaints it would be that they don't offer sides. I can live with that!"}
{"text":"This food truck is awesome- I've always had great food here but the best thing by far, unsurprisingly, is the bahn mi sandwich. I love the BBQ pork and the lemongrass chicken is also delicious. If you're super hungry you can get them to top your sandwich with a fresh fried egg!

Yesterday I tried their rice bowl and it was also really nice. It has good flavor and the rice had a great texture to it that made the bowl very enjoyable. For all you spice lovers, I'd ask for some extra sriracha!

The only thing I have left to try are the tacos and I'm betting they're pretty good. This is a great go-to food truck and I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Best authentic Vietnamese food in Charlotte! I love the lemongrass bowl! You can find their food truck anywhere by following them on Instagram. It's SO good!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! I can't say enough good things about this truck the food and service is amazing! I love the food truck scene and this is my favorite truck in Charlotte I usually try and hit them up on Tuesdays uptown when they are parked next to the element but I do follow this truck around. I have loved this truck since day one and I think I have had just about everything on their menu and it's all amazing!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love eating from Yummi Banh Mi, the truck and the street-side cafe. I had been telling the people in my office about it so today I place my order via email and went and picked up lunch for several of us here and they all loved it. I can't say good enough things about yall's food."}
{"text":"Yummi Yummi Get In My Tummi!

My buddies and I were on our way down to Charleston for our friend's wedding and needed liquid caffeine (aka coffee aka the nectar of cacao) for the 3.5 hour drive. We literally parked behind the Yummi Banh Mi food truck and that's when I realized it was destiny for me to order something. We were in the Third Ward neighborhood of Charlotte. 

Initially walking past it, the truck was closed. It opened at 11 a.m. and we got there around 10:40 a.m. I stood and stared at the menu for a good 4 minutes before one of the workers came out and said \"Hey man, we'll be open soon, so you'll get your banh mi soon!\" We went to the Starbucks and got some coffee. I thought the coffee would quell my hunger for the banh mi, but it only amplified it. I went back out and there was already a dude standing to get his food. It was 10:52 a.m. I knocked on the door of the truck and the worker came out and said he could take my order. Score!

I ordered the Lemongrass Pork Banh Mi. For a $7.50 price tag, the sandwich was pretty pricey but delicious nonetheless. Pork was seasoned well and it came with pickled carrots, cucumbers, and 2 pieces of jalapenos. 

A+ for the customer service, A for the food, A- for the price, and A-mazing for the yellow theme truck with the bomb ass logo!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried a banh mi sandwich before you should hunt this food truck down and cross it off your foodie bucket list. We were lucky to catch up with them at the food truck rally in Matthews.  

My husband got the lemongrass beef sandwich and the Asian in me was compelled to get BBQ pork Vietnamese rice bowl....delicious! I highly suggest ordering the egg on top of the sandwich (got this little nugget of info from one of the yelp reviews). The meal came with a ramekin of sauce. We weren't sure what it was or even what meal it was supposed to go with so we didn't ask questions and dumped it over the rice bowl. It complemented the dish well without over powering it.  

This place is worth following to its next destination. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG Savory!!

Simple menu, reasonably priced, quick food & very healthy! I have only had the rice bowl, but wow is it tasty - could use more veggies, but overall YUM!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yummi Banh Mi truck is awesome and a welcomed addition to the charlotte food truck scene. I recommend trying the lemongrass pork on either a sandwich or rice bowl. The marinade they use has such a great flavor, especially compared to the other crisp, fresh toppings. 

A huge plus for me is how genuinely friendly and enthusiastic the staff is. If you've never had vietnamese food, they are excited to tell you about their products. They chat with you and get you know you while you wait. It's overall a great food truck experience. 

I usually check to see if the truck is nearby when I'm getting snackish. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This food truck is becoming one of my favorites in Charlotte.  I usually hit it up when it parks at the Element Uptown (next to Romeare Bearden Park - next to the 7-Eleven) on Tuesdays for lunch.  So great to have great food and to have a nice park to consume it in.

You pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I've had a little bit of everything and I have not been disappointed.  Their flavors pack a punch... and some heat (if you don't mind the fresh peppers sliced into your sandwich, tacos, or rice bowl).   My favorite is the BBQ Pork....

The guys working the truck are super friendly and just sling out good food.  Luckily my lunch break is later than most folks so I hit them up around 1pm and there isn't a line, but usually they have some war stories of the line stretching out really long, but I think with this new Tuesday stop, people are starting to figure out their schedules and staggering their visits.

A number of beverages are available in a cooler: sodas and even asian drinks (which I have yet to try) maybe next time.  Will always be looking out for the tan truck with a giant pac-man logo wearing an asian style conical hat."}
{"text":"I follow things like food trucks on my instagram and this was one account that I had followed to see where they were at and finally one day, they were close enough to me I could scoot over on my lunch break.

So I did what a true foodie would do and ordered a bahn mi and a rice bowl. The bahn mi was pretty good. Not the best I have ever had but overall I was happy. I just prefer my bahn mi on a a baguette vs. a French roll. The meat was seasoned properly but it was just too much bread for me. For me the BBQ pork is greater than the lemongrass pork.

The rice bowl was banging. I added a fried egg, and should have asked if they could have left it runny. This would have made my rice bowl perfect. The pork was cooked well and seasoned righteously. 

Definitely good solid eats coming out of a food truck and one of the best food truck experiences you can have in Charlotte."}
{"text":"EASILY one of the best banh mi sandwiches I've ever had and I've eaten A LOT of banh mi in my life. Their Vietnamese limeade is also so good and tastes so fresh."}
