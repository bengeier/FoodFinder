{"text":"Shortly after discovering this gem, my sister and I became regulars. We love the spicy tonkotsu ramen, although I see from the tips that you can pay a bit extra and get some gyoza  and other stuff thrown in too--SCORE! I am a big fan of the perfectly just-under-hard-boiled egg, which I save for \"dessert\". Ramen Kid's atmosphere is hip-divey, with casual tables and chairs and Manga decorating the walls--perfect for a casual lunch or dinner. I'd be here for breakfast too, if they'd just open earlier."}
{"text":"Current best ramen place in Madison. Why? Because all other ramen joints around here charge way over $10. Ramen Kid knows that's not the point, and their ramen is as good as any other place. Maybe their pork belly is a little fattier/lower quality but otherwise it's identical I think. And yes, Sujeo's noodles are great but it inflates their price by so much, and they don't do tonkotsu ramen which is a damn shame. So, if you want reasonable ramen at a good price, go here. No reason to frequent the fancy places that are always crowded. Don't waste time waiting in line at any other place when it's not going to be any different. It might even be worse...  Now, don't get me wrong. Madison has a ways to go to get good ramen. Some day...but maybe the nicer ingredients are too spendy? But all the other expensive ramens around here are not anything amazing. I guess they just can't get the ingredient easily."}
{"text":"Ramen is pretty good but I can't give this place more than 2 stars because of the service. The wait staff rarely check in, when they do they obviously can't take social queues and interrupt you in the middle of a deep conversation(long after you've gotten your food, not after the first couple of bites). Never get refills on my drink, food takes forever to arrive. I won't be back as the ramen place on park street is miles better."}
{"text":"A group of us were in Madison for an event at the University that got out just before 9:30 pm on Saturday. Being unfamiliar with the city, we walked around looking for a place to eat and walked into Ramen Kid without knowing it was less than 10 minutes before they closed for the night. Despite that, they seated and served us with incredible grace, and treated us exceptionally kindly, telling us not to worry about rushing and take our time with the food.  The food itself was really great! As someone who grew up in CA, I'm pretty familiar with ramen shops, and I have nothing to complain about with Ramen Kid. I love that there are so many different varieties - more than I've seen anywhere else - and several members of our group had actually never eaten at a real ramen shop before, and were very pleased with their first experience. Portions are quite sizeable and priced very reasonably, and service is obviously top-notch.  Not sure when I'll have the occasion to be in Madison again, but if I find myself there, I would definitely love to stop by this place again to give it a more leisurely experience."}
{"text":"I came to Ramen Kid on a blustery Wisconsin winter night. I am a big fan of ramen, so I had been anticipating the opening of this establishment for some time.   I ordered the Miso-Based Vegetarian ramen bowl, as well as the Takoyaki (Octopus dumplings). The ramen was flavored well and had the necessary components including a hard boiled egg, green unions and a heaping mound of slippery noodles. The fried octopus dumplings were also satisfactory; a sensually greasy combination to say the least.  The ramen itself is not groundbreaking. No incredibly unique flavors or toppings, but it checks all the boxes and left me content. The price makes up for the lack of originality; most bowls run around $7-8, which is more than enough of an incentive to make me a repeat customer.   The ramen was hot, the service was quick and the price was right. I recommend checking this spot out on a dismal and dreary winter day. it'll warm you up."}
{"text":"A classmate and I got takeout ramen from this place for dinner last night. Instead of ordering ahead of time we did it there and the nice man at the front was very quick about taking our orders and getting them going. The ambience is casual. The katakana and hiragana symbols on the walls, plus the decor, made me feel like I was at a little ramen shop in Japan. The restaurant has a rather small eating area with tables very close together so if you want your space while dining this isn't for you. The only problem I noticed besides the space was the ventilation. The restaurant could use better air circulation because it was hot and stuffy inside. However, the food was tasty. The tonkatsu ramen I got had a very authentic flavor. Although, when I think of tonkatsu I think of a breaded pork cutlet smothered in Japanese style curry or a sweet soy based sauce and the pork in this dish was braised, so I don't know why they named it tonkatsu. At any rate, the meat was savory and tender with a slightly smoked crunch along the edge, the broth was rich, and the corn, sprouts, and onions were very fresh. My friend got the spicy tonkatsu ramen and a side of gyoza, both of which were very good according to her. I would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"I had the pork katsu curry a week ago and it was awesome. I was told it was homemade and it tasted homemade . When I visited today and ordered the same thing, what came out was not the same thing which I ate a week before. It was like Ramen Kid used the prepackaged golden curry which you can buy at the supermarket to make the curry (and I am very sure that they did use those golden curry cubes to make this curry). It no longer tasted homemade or great, it was generic and not something I would pay 8 dollars for when I can make it at home. The food is definitely going downhill."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to order to go. I was told it'd take 10-15 minutes so I went for a walk around the block during my wait. I returned 15 minutes later and was told it would just be another couple of minutes. It was another 15. So I stood there watching the kitchen work and finally saw a guy throw my ingredients (pre made) into a to go package about a half hour after I'd ordered. And it took all of one minute.  The ramen itself is pretty good and flavorful (I ordered the miso) but I was pretty put off by the wait, with no apologies."}
{"text":"Having eaten in Japan for 3 months, the food was decent enough for something in the Midwest. I got the Tonkotsu ramen. Their noodles were a good texture but the broth was a bit powdery for some reason. It was flavorful but not fragrent and a bit salty. I would suggest bringing a thing of sesame seeds to put on top. The cha siu was a bit dry and unflavorful, not the soft, fatty meat that I was expecting. The takoyaki was pretty disappointing though. It was cold in the center for some of them. They were also a but hard on the outside and not as flavorful as they should be.   The staff were friendly but very understaffed and disorganized. I was lucky to go right when a seat opened up. They couldn't keep track which group should be seated when creating traffic. I would have to give them another star for how nice they were though."}
{"text":"The service is horrendous. First, they forgot my order. When my partner was waiting with me after his food arrived, our server went up to him and asked what was wrong. I thought she might have been talking to me since it was obvious that my food was missing, but nope, she actually wanted to know if everything was alright with him. I had to bring my missing food to her attention and then they realize they messed up. We then had to ask for our check twice with our server and two separate times with two other servers. Everyone said yes but nobody brought our check. We ended up going to the counter to pay. While we were lining up, All three servers continued to move around us and the restaurant like we never asked for our check in the first place.   This is our second try. The first time we came was their opening day and they served shio ramen that was basically boiled water. We really want them to do well but we have been disappointed again."}
{"text":"This place is....good.  Pretty good.  I lived in Madison back in the day when there was no ramen at all so I'm excited to see some competition, and Ramen Kid was my first to try simply because they're open for lunch.  I had the tonkotsu ramen, and for $8.25, I can't complain a lot, but there were a few serious missteps:  1. The chashu was sitting on top and stone cold.  At least bury it in the broth before you serve it - it'll warm up on its way to the table 2. Cheap wooden chopsticks are the suck for ramen [also everything else but especially ramen] 3. Worst of all, I had a bunch of clumped-together noodle chunks in my bowl; nobody likes that and it's arguably send-back-worthy 4. Some guy [not my server] asked me if I wanted free edamame after I was about 2/3 done with my soup; free edamame isn't bad, but it's not exactly dessert, and I was super full by then  All this said, I'd still go again - the soup tasted good, and it's a damn sight better than the nothing that existed here six years ago.  And it's dirt cheap, so OK.  But it has a ways to go before I'd be excited about it."}
{"text":"Pretty ok ramen for Madison. It doesn't sound too bad to go on a rainy day or cold weather."}
{"text":"one of the worst ramen I ever had :(  I do not recommend. The noodle taste like instant ramen noodle. The egg is fully cooked which is not supposed to be. The meat smells kind of funny.  The price is ok so it would a ok place just to grab some lunch / dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. As we waited for our food, a worker came up and chatted with my friend and I.   Extremely satisfied and will return again."}
{"text":"IDidn't realize Ramen could be this good. Staff are nice and gave me my first Sake. Nice to have something different for late night munchie!"}
{"text":"I dined solo on a Monday evening. It wasn't crowded, and service was good. This is a substantial portion of ramen for someone who is somewhat health conscious. Two slices of char shou was plenty for me, but I added deep fried tofu. I did the spicy tonkatsu, which was more oily than spicy. Still, pretty good for an every-now-and-then, college town bowl of ramen. I would go back."}
{"text":"I've eaten ramen many times in Japan and Hawaii and having this place in little madison is a huge plus. Super cheap for a what you get. The broth isn't as rich as umami (which is way too rich) but it's anything but bland and the noodles taste freshly made.  Definitely not instant ramenesque. Sometimes the service is a little slow. But you will be in an out in less that 30 minutes...good enough for me."}
{"text":"This is a really nice place to eat. Nice decor. Some cool anime on the walls. Good service. The food is really nice excellent ramen and the gyoza is worth a try."}
{"text":"Ramen kid is really cool in that it's really the only place super close to / on campus to get good quality Ramen.  I went with friends couple days after their grand opening and ordered the Spicy Miso ramen and the Chicken Karage.  The Spicy Miso soup base was really good, full of flavor, but it wasn't very spicy, although I should clarify that I have a very high spice tolerance.  The Chicken Karage wasn't what I expected for chicken karage.  It seemed a lot more like friend chicken than marinated chicken (as stated on their menu).  It was still good though. However, because I went close to their opening day, things were still a bit hectic.  Especially with all the college students coming back from winter break.  There were lots of people there but they were understaffed.  There ended up being a 45 minute wait by 8PM.  Due to the understaffing, they constantly mixed up our order, but were super nice about making sure that we got the right order.  I also had to ask them for water as they did't have time to come around to check on us.  Regardless, the food and the service was good, especially for being understaffed.  I would recommend, though, potentially waiting until they've got everything sorted out and organized before you go."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come here \"Kid\".  They always have new type of ramen which makes me remember the time when I was growing up in Japan.  Service is super good and friendly at this quiet season, schools are closed for holiday so very few students.  We know schools are open this place gets busy most of days. When I was student at UW there was no ramen at anyplace. Japanese foods were available only at Ginza and Wasabi. Now Ramen Kid, Wasabi and Muramoto are here in Madison. They are only restaurants serve true Japanese Foods I love."}
{"text":"2nd visit at the great ramen place. Tried gyoza, kara-age & goma-ae at Sunday noon, no wait time. The quality of these snacks needs to be improved. The way beans were cut and saused could be better. Staff friendly as always. The room is well air-conditioned but pretty moist due to the vapour coming from open kitchen. Coming back next time for other dishes."}
{"text":"In summary, come with good company to slurp some noodles and eat some takoyaki but don't expect amazing service.  I've visited this restaurant a handful of times and have generally eaten some pretty delicious bowls of ramen given a craving and proximity to campus.   Even my parents (a pair of tough critics) mentioned how fragrant the soup (they had the spicy miso and Tanaka) was and enjoyed the texture of the noodles; despite my mom's soup being a little salty, my mom asked for some hot water and was pleasantly greeted by a salt free broth instead. I had the tempura ramen, which was satisfying and extremely savory.   One of our bowls was forgotten about so we had to ask someone on the waitstaff; it always seems that the waitstaff is kind of disoriented and not particularly attentive to customers in regards to checking in on meals or filling up on water unless asked, hence the one star deduction."}
{"text":"Good Ramen for 8$! Better broth and cheaper prices than Umami... but the service was pretty terrible.  We'll definitely be back for take out though."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for my ramen in an almost empty restaurant. Apparently they skipped my order."}
{"text":"I went down to lunch today at Madistan(another new favorite of mine) and saw Ramen Kid had opened. We did the only logical thing and came back downtown for dinner.  My first thought was that we screwed up. Employees were eating in the dining room and one of their kids running around, but I think this can be accounted for by the recent opening(maybe even today). You order at the front and the counter worker was very kind, but the whole ordering process went a little rough. The men's bathroom had a wall soap despenser sitting on the side of the sink, but my wife said the women's was very nice and had a bidet.  The food was great. My wife had the tonkotsu ramen and I had the pork katsu; then we split the edamame. The food all came out at once. The pork cutlet came with a dark sauce, amazing. I've only had pork katsu once before at Saboten in Hong Kong and I thought I'd never find anything as good at home. However, this was just as good or better. The only complaint was the portion was a little small and the rice that came with it was just okay.  The ramen came with a perfectly soft boiled egg. The problem was that we ordered an extra egg and it only came with a half egg total. The broth was thick and salty, so really good.  The pork inside was very tender and had great flavor.  5 for the food 3 for ambiance, worth fighting badger hockey parking for"}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly the sake is hot and delicious and hey the ramen is tasty ...this place is a great way to end your day after shopping in Madison."}
{"text":"The food is fine but the service is really poor. We've been seated for almost 10min but no one came to us to offer us cups of water and take our order. Instead, three of the waiters were just standing together, chatting. And a waiter, probably just start here, gave food to wrong tables twice. I hate to give bad reviews but this time I'm just really upset. The service must be improved and the waiters should be well-trained."}
{"text":"We tried Ramen Kid for dinner on Thursday evening. There were other diners there when we arrived so we viewed that as a good sign. The hostess/waitress told us to seat ourselves and then brought us menus and water. The menu has multiple ramen varieties in addition to other appetizer, rice, and noodle dishes. I did notice that the menu they gave us at the table varied from the menu on the door and the menu on-line.  When our waitress returned we ordered the takoyaki, the tempura ramen, and the spicy tonkotsu. The takoyaki are deep-fried balls which contains chunks of octopus and a mayo sauce. My partner liked them a lot. It took quite a while, but our entrees eventually arrived. Both the ramen and the takoyaki were well flavored and filling. We have no complaints about the food.  My main issue was the incredibly long wait from the time we finished eating until we were finally able to get the waitress's attention to bring us the bill. She didn't seem to be waiting on tables, just lingering around the bar. After an unfathomably long wait we finally got up to ask her for the bill. She dropped off the check, but then there was another exceedingly long wait before she returned to run the credit card. Again, she didn't seem to be busy during that time, just hanging out at the bar.  The food was fine, but with better service at other locations, if I want ramen, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ramen was not at all great. The broth was bear flavorless and quite salty, the pork the was add crumbled around the edges showing that it was maybe not fresh (frozen and not even defrosted), the vegetables added were minimal, and (WORST OF ALL), the noodles were not nearly restaurant quality. The noodles had no bite to it and no \"flavor\". The texture of he noodles were soggy and weak. This made me think that the noodles were that of a dried noodle packet you could get from an instant ramen packet. I personally don't think the soup was worth the pay."}
{"text":"First experience and it was decent. The ramen was tasty and the portion size was commendable. However, the small restaurant smelt odd...like smelly old wet laundry."}
{"text":"The ramen was bland - not much flavor at all.. Also, the waiter gave us the check while we were in the middle of eating and came back to take the check so we told him we were not even done eating yet... pretty darn rude to do that! (without even asking if everything was okay or providing more water)"}
{"text":"Ok this is the best ramen I've had in Madison but it's still is missing a little umami/something. Broth is rich and dense and the pork is just good. Other diners commented on how buttery the noodles seemed, which was a good thing. they are on to something here. Keep up the good work! I also give a big thumbs up for the 2 Totoros and one Godzilla pict found on the wall too!  Always nice to  know you are eating at a place that likes Totoro as much as you!"}
{"text":"Ordered spicy tonkatsu ramen Very disappointing. Not authentic. Does not meet the expectations I had. At least you should make your broth good and heavy and yet you failed....  noodle tastes like instant noodle,  Broth not heavy at all, no flavor, but this may due to not having artificial spices?  no salt as traditional ramen,  Pork belly has no flavor,  Half cooked egg has no flavor"}
{"text":"So this place is much better than the reviews seem to indicate. The food is authentic and the service was fine. To be fair to the other reviewers, we were there at 10:30pm, so not too many customers.   Takoyaki was great and the spicy tonkatsu ramen was excellent! It was actually spicy without having to pay for extra \"spice bombs.\"  We'll definitely be back for some Takoyaki and ramen when the hankering hits!"}
{"text":"These five stars are for the food! The tonkotsu ramen rivaled the version I had at David Chang's Momofuku. It had a rich pork broth with delightfully salty homemade noodles and toppings. We added the nori sheets because--nori. It was the best soul-warming, umami-packed bowl of ramen I've had. I'd recommend stirring the broth a bit before tasting it, because the flavor-dense bits of the soup tend to hang out around the bottom half of the bowl.  For an extra couple bucks, we turned our bowl-to-share into a combo with 3 potstickers. The potstickers were delightfully crispy!   Like everyone else, I'm going to complain about the service. It was unfortunately the worst service I have received. Everyone working there was nice, but it seemed like they were just hanging out or hadn't been trained yet. For example, we asked a server for another bowl so we could share the ramen, and a few minutes later saw her across the restaurant chatting with the chef, while we wondered where our extra bowl was. I'm really hoping that, because this was only the second week the restaurant was open, and because they were totally in the weeds, that all of these issues will be resolved in the near future! Their food is way to good to be ruined over poor service. Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"YELP Elites have been blowing this place up, so I didn't want to be left out. Glad I made the 40+ mile trip to check it out!!  I stopped by for a late lunch around 3pm. Parking wasn't a problem and I was immediately seated when I came in.  The server gave me the option of wherever I wanted to sit.   I had already looked at the menu online before I came in so I knew exactly what I wanted. Started with the spicy Gyoza(pan fried) and then ordered the spicy miso.  The Goyza was flavorful and it was a decent amount of food for an appetizer. The only con would be the large amount of grease on them from the meat. But I just let them drip a little bit before indulging in them. I found that they had more than enough flavor that I didn't need the dipping sauce.  The spicy miso was filling and full of flavor! Next time I order it though I am going to go with extra noodles and extra pork Chashu. I was disappointed to only find one slice of Chashu in my bowl. The egg was cooked perfectly and I found that the bowl had a perfect balance of veggies, broth and noodles. I am just partial to the noodles, that's why I would order extra next time.  The ambiance and decor was nice. Playing some more modern hip hop music really cheered things up (glad they didn't have the usual Asian music going on). Unfortunately a group came in after me and they couldn't keep their kids under control, running around and yelling. But that's not the restaurant's fault.  Total bill was very reasonable, $14.72 for the entire meal. Great value in my opinion. If you are in need of a warm full belly, hit up Ramen Kid for sure!!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. I had the Spicy Tonkotsu and it's a really good place if you want to stuff your mouth with nice, warm noodles. Really liked the Gyozi appetizer as well. The servers could be a tad more attentive when it's time to receive the bill - they usually do take a while to give me the check. All in all, though, I always enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for lunch. Got the spicy pork ramen with added fried tofu and the combo with 3 octopus dumplings. Was not disappointed one bit. The dumplings didn't even make it home. The broth was delicious and the pork wasn't overcooked at all. Nice and tender. The egg didn't have much flavor besides egg flavor. Everything was all around good. The crew was friendly and had my order ready to go as soon as I walked through the door. I will definitely be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Ramen place in Madison! The atmosphere is very relaxed, and the food is fantastic. I always have the tonkotsu, but have tried the other broths and have enjoyed each. I particularly like the spicy tonkotsu ramen, but the spicy miso is fantastic as well.  When you order one of the \"spicy\" ramens, they serve it with a delicious spicy miso ground pork toppper which really adds a nice spice to the ramen base. The actual cuts of pork they serve in their tonkotsu broths are good, but not the best I have ever had.  If you are in the mood for a drink, Sapporo, Kirin, and several varieties of sake are all on the menu. And the best part? Each drink purchase comes with a side of salted edamame on the house!  If you are in the mood to eat a lot, you can combo a ramen with a few options for sides for a discount. I like pairing my ramen with extra noodles (if I am very hungry), curry rice (if I am moderately hungry), or takoyaki (if I am in the mood for a treat).  By the way, their takoyaki is very good too. If you are a little leery of octopus dumplings, I would encourage you to bite the bullet and give them a try anyway. They are really delicious.  I would recommend this place to anyone - even for you picky eaters out there. I took one of my picky friends here, and they found a few options on the menu that spoke to them. This includes the chicken ramen, which is very mild and palatable. There's really an option for everyone."}
{"text":"Worst karage chicken ever. They advertised their bento box so i decided to order to go. I waited 15-20' for an overfried chicken. It s so dry cant even chew"}
{"text":"Awesome food !!! service was excellent seems our orders were taken quickly and food came fast... Loved the shoyu ramen will come again"}
{"text":"I went to Ramen Kid with two colleagues-- one who lived in Japan while teaching abroad, and another who just got back from Japan. We all have a pretty high bar when it comes to Japanese food and we were blown away by this place. It was really reasonably priced, the servings were ample, and the food was all delicious. The decor is very authentic too.   Ramen Kid serves takoyaki (octopus dumplings), which I only rarely see on menus in the U.S. but loved while I was in Japan. Light and fluffy batter with pieces of octopus inside bite-size dumplings. After frying the dumplings are then covered by Japanese mayo, worcester sauce, and bonito flakes. Super authentic. I'll absolutely get them again.   The soups were terrific-- I had the spicy miso, my friend had the spicy tonkotsu, and the third had one of the curry dishes with fried pork. They were great. My friend reported that the pork in the curry dish was a tiny bit over-cooked, but still thought it was great. I tried his and loved it; I only noticed what he was talking about after he mentioned it. We were the first to arrive for lunch so perhaps the oil was a bit hot in anticipation of the rush. I'd still order the dish.   We all kept exclaiming throughout the meal how happy we were to have found this place. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have had a few different ramens from this place. Japanese ramen is suppose to be rich and full of flavor but their broth is extremely blan. For their spicy ramens I am pretty sure they just use the regular ramen base and dump spicy oil on top (which just becomes oily broth). I most definitely will not be getting ramen from here anymore. If I am truly desperate for ramen around this area, I'll hit up a grocery store and buy one of those cup of ramen for 99 cent."}
{"text":"I went to ramen kid Last week. Didn't expect much because not many ramen competition in Madison like NY or LA.  Wow surprised . It was so good  I'll be back"}
{"text":"I LOVED the tonkatsu ramen. It has been 2 years since I have eaten Ramen in Japan, and this really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Being from California, I've had a lot of ramen so I speak from that experience. Overall, as long as I can order \"less salt\" I my tonkotsu ramen, it's good.   It was my first time trying it and looking at past reviews, I noticed that some people complained it was too salty so I went ahead and order \"less salt\".  It worked! I don't like salty things so it was perfect for me. The broth was nice and hot and the right taste.   What I didn't really like was the pork slices, which were too chewy, lean, and not soft or \"melt in your mouth\" like many places I've tried. The egg was also ok, just half a slice and not slow cooked.   Overall, i was pleasantly surprised because it was good for a Midwest ramen restaurant. It was a good bowl for lunch and I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"The noodles are clearly not made in house; they are basically what you would get out of a top ramen package. The spicy tonkatsu broth was tasty, but the pork was dry, there was a weird ground meat, and the egg was cold...  I am really hoping to find a better ramen place in Madison; I would only come here in the case of a severe craving..."}
{"text":"Ramen Kid was delicious. A group of us headed there after meeting at the University all day. All but one of us had the ramen. Mine was delicious, the portions were huge, you do not have to be afraid of not getting full on broth and noodles. It was affordably priced, and all but one of the meals were super timely, timely enough to get us back for our second round of evening meetings. (The meal that was forgotten was the non-ramen meal.) Great flavors. Atmosphere was fun. Highly recommend it for a meal."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3 stars because the food was decent but I just can't, because of the waitress who served me here. Tried this place out last night and I wanted an import beer with my meal. When I asked the waitress about the beer selection, she said she didn't know of the kind of beers they carried, then I asked her if she could find out, her reply was 'I'm not familiar with the beer here but you can get up and go look at the cooler behind the counter' this might be the most incompetent and ridiculous thing I've heard in my life and I wanted to get up and walk out. I have no idea how she has a job and makes any money in tips at that, improve your service or I will not recommend or return to Ramen Kid."}
{"text":"I might have made a mistake coming here right after a trip to Japan, but it was rainy and cold and I wanted something comforting.  I ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen an found it lackluster at best. The broth lacked flavor and depth. The corn added unnecessary sweetness. The egg was overboiled. The noodles were too soft. The chasu was good. The   The reason why they still get 3 stars is that on the couple of times I went pre-Japan I found the ramen pretty decent and better than the average ramen you can get in the Midwest. I would definitely recommend the spicy ramen though."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Found it by accident while looking for something \"new\" around town.  Food- Excellent. Had the 'make your own poke bowl' and, as I am rather poke obsessed, I was quite thrilled with what I got. (A touch heavy on the greens, not a poke I am used to, admittedly, but that was kinda the point of a 'make your own'.) Also ordered the Takoyaki and WHOA, I could eat platefuls of that stuff. Wow! (I left too full for dessert having also found that my meal included miso soup--well done, btw!--and edamame--because I also bought hot sake.) Atmo- Fun. Relaxed. Clean and bright. Will I go back? Absolutely. Is it a gourmet experience? Well.. what in Madison is for less than $20? I was filled up with good food that I cannot get easily anywhere else. Let's just say that, if I were still a student, they'd be getting most of my money (and I'd eat through most of their takoyaki, miso soup, and edamame....)"}
{"text":"I went to Ramen Kid with my siblings who absolutely love ramen. We got the spring rolls, Spicy Tonkatsu, and the miso ramen. At first when the food came out, we didn't realize that the ramen came with an egg on top (we thought that it was an extra thing we had to order), and my brother was allergic to eggs so they kindly remade our food. The service was very nice and the server and the cook in the back was kind as well.  The decoration of the place was epic. They had anime on the top wall which was really cool.  The food was delicious. I can't go back to instant ramen anymore. The ramen was on another level and we ended up eating everything and drinking all of the broth. My favorite was the spicy tonkatsu, it was a little salty but I like salty foods anyway. The noodles were nice and the portions were perfect.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place and the ramen."}
{"text":"The Good: I ordered the Tonkatsu and it was delicious. The broth was creamy and flavorful. There was a perfect ratio of ingredients with the exception of pork. I would have liked one more slice of pork.   The Not So Good: The worst service I have ever experienced in Madison. Ruined my experience. From start to finish:  -We were seated and our waitress left. No menus were dropped off or silver wear set. We ended up taking the menus from a different table and the silver wear from another halfway through our meal.  -We sat for at least 15 minutes before we were brought water by a different waitress who had obviously noticed we were essentially abandoned. Our own waitress came with water about ten minutes later and was shocked we had already gotten water. If you are keeping up with the math, this would have meant our waitress would have brought our water at least 25 minutes into sitting at the restaurant.   -I went with two friends. Our main dishes came out sporadically. Temperature was a bit off.  -I would say 50% of our experience consisted of waiting for checks. My friend eventually went to the front and asked if we pay up front or at table. The waitress replied either worked. I wish we had payed up front because what commenced was an outrageous wait. I could see the other waitress side-eyeing our table because we were clearly unhappy at this point.  -It took so long for our checks to come back that we legit went to the front to intercept so we could make a swift exit.  As for food, my friends who ordered veggie ramen complained to me it was too salty and the noodles were chalky. I did not understand until I tried a bite. I would have been complaining too!    Highlight: The place itself has a cool vibe. It is a shame that for a restaurant, that is not enough to get me back. However, I would order in my ramen and request extra pork. Very good and saved the restaurant from a one star rating.   I was very excited for Ramen Kid based off of previous reviews I had read. I left feeling betrayed by the hype."}
{"text":"Better than Umami, broth flavor is somewhat richer than Umami and its location is on campus which is huge. Def willing to come back for occasional hangover."}
{"text":"A few cocky ass critisize this restaurant. Don't listen to them. This is good restaurant. Some Asian reviews say \"authentic Japnese food\". Ramen is not authentic food. They don't know authentic food. I talked with chief chef. He is from famous Japanese restaurant ?in Chicago, in Kusatsu Japan?, so he adjusted to Madison taste. This is good restaurant. No doubt ? They open 11am to 9:30pm everyday."}
{"text":"I'm no ramen expert, but this seems like a 3.5-star place to me. The food is good- the noodles, broth, pork dumplings, mushrooms and onions are all quite nice. The marinated eggs are hardly marinated- really just soft boiled; they don't have much extra flavor! I've definitely had better eggs anddd better chashu pork. And the service here isn't great... you kinda have to run around the little place to get anyone's attention. All of that aside, the prices here are great for a filling meal, and you can even expect to bring a dece portion home. I'll probs be back, because a bowl of yummy comfort soup is always, always tempting!"}
{"text":"I have never left a review before, but I was so compelled to write a descriptive one for Ramen Kid given my lacking experience.   Walking into the restaurant, I was excited - Ramen Kid is like, the second ramen restaurant to open up in the whole city of Madison. The restaurant didn't seem to be too busy but it was congested at the door. There was a party of 6, a group of 3, and a bunch of couples waiting to get seated. My boyfriend and I were not even acknowledge for a solid 15 minutes because people were just loitering the door waiting for the waiters to get them situated. Lost, confused, and hungry, we had no idea how the restaurant setting was - we lowkey stared at their wall menu until we were greeted. We were finally seated in the back away from the door where it was nice and warm. Our waitress was very cheery and nice. She got us waters right away and took our order. It seemed flawless until we suffered 30 minutes of waiting and waiting and waiting for food. To make things worse, we witnessed literally everything that could go wrong in a newly opened restaurant. Over the Japanese EDM-like music, you could hear the cooks and waiters bickering about orders and food preparations. Customers were given the wrong food items or wrong checks and people were sandwiched into seats too close for comfort. It seemed as if the store manager seemed to be apologizing for all of her actions.   But let's talk more about the focus of the restaurant - the ramen and food. My boyfriend ordered the Tonkotsu ramen - a supposedly thick pork soup with a marinated soft boiled egg, green onions, bamboo shoots and pork chashu. When it arrived, it was literally was a giant bowl of milky brown broth, green onions, and noodles - a lot of noodles. The boiled egg was basically half of a hard-boiled egg, the meat consisted of 2 ultra-thin slices, and the bamboo shoots were basically 3 flat slices as well. I can't say that  the broth was as flavorful and savory as it is at Umami. For me, I was a little more adventurous -  I had the Kara-age curry. It was plated very nicely but was simply dark chicken meat battered and fried served over rice with a thick, dark brown beef gravy-tasting sauce. It was bland in flavor as well but filling for a hangry customer, I guess. But wait, we also order Takoyaki as an appetizer that was sooooooo backed up it came out with the ramen and curry. Being in battered ball form, it appeared to be delicious but it was only upon consumption that the octopus was a hide-and-go-seek game. The batter was so boring and overbearing that I struggled to find the small flavorless and rubbery piece of octopus promised in my dumpling.   Service was disappointing, food was disappointing. Overall, this place was a mediocre place. Given my experience, I wouldn't come back unless I was drunk or hungover - not worth the wait and the food was so bland. To make it worse, I don't think I left with a full feeling of satisfaction - please give me reason to come back again."}
{"text":"As someone who lived in japan for 4 years and fell in love with the food, I can honestly say that this is the closest I've come to legitimate ramen. To me it tastes like home. It's worth the hour drive for me to get the tonkatsu ramen with a side of the AMAZING curry. I'll finish by saying that if you want the real ramen experience, than this is FOR SURE the place to go!"}
{"text":"So you're probably wondering if I liked this more than I liked this more than Umami ramen, and the answer is yes!  Umami is a more hipster kind of place. Ramen kid is for the anime geek.  I got tonkotsu with extra noodles and extra chashu for $12. The broth was creamy and savory with just the right amount of salt. The green onions added a lot to the flavor too. The noodles were nice and bouncy. The menma was the best I've had and had a savory fermented flavor that wasn't too sweet. The marinated egg was perfect; it had a runny yolk and a savory flavor. The chashu was thicker than I would've liked, but it was unique. It was incredibly soft and smoky unlike any other chashu I've had.  I got the karage too, but it wasn't that great compared to others I've had. It pretty much just tasted like beer-battered chicken tenders.  The atmosphere was awesome too! You can eat in front of the kitchen like they do in anime, and they have a collage of manga above the kitchen.   Next time, I'm going to try the takoyaki and the other ramens. I think I found a new go-to spot!  Updates: 2/17/16 - Got spicy miso with extra noodles, extra chashu, and menma. The menma and chashu were different than last time, but still great. The chashu was much softer and tender. It was like a broth sponge. Not as smoky or chunky this time; it was in traditional slices but on the thicker side. Also, the amount of chashu with extra was the size of my fist. The menma tasted the same, but it was the usual shape this time instead of the kind i got in my picture. Still my favorite chashu and menma ever!"}
{"text":"Spending the annual weekend in Madison and after a few beers noodles sounded good. Walked in and was seated and given menus. Got the curry noodles and shoyu noodles and it was both cheap and ridiculously tasty. Might go back tomorrow"}
{"text":"I love ramen and that's why when I heard about Ramen Kid, I was extremely excited. After trying Ramen Kid, I was left disappointed. I had high hopes for this place and was hoping it would be my new \"go to.\" As we walked in, we were unsure if it was self seating or not. We were then greeted by two different people at the same time (they were both confused about who was seating us.) we were sat and got our drinks. One server sat us, another server asked if we were ready, and then another server took our order. We ordered the tonkatsu, spicy miso, and for an appetizer we ordered the octopus and chicken bites. We received our appetizers and both appetizers were plain. If it weren't for the mayo on the octopus, it would've been extremely plain. We were then told that they ran out of the pork for the spicy miso, so we ordered the chicken cutlet curry. In the middle of our appetizers, a server came and asked us if we were ready for the bill..... why.. just why... we haven't even gotten our main dish yet. She apologized and walked away. We got our main dishes and everything was plain. The worst ramen experience that I've ever had. The soup was plain, the pork was plain, everything was plain. It then took a while to get our check, so we got up and paid in the front and the cashier was completely clueless and took a while to separate our bill. (The same server that asked if we were ready for our bill during our appetizers....)  Overall, the servers were nice but clueless and unorganized. The food was plain and disappointing."}
{"text":"Now that there are two ramen places in Madison, I feel it's imperative that the two be compared. This review hopes to answer any questions you might have in deciding whether to go here, Ramen Kid, or its competition, Umami. To test consistently, I ordered a classical Japanese ramen meal - pan-fried pork gyoza and tonkatsu ramen - at both places.   At Ramen Kid, you get half of a soft-boiled egg and bamboo shoots (seaweed is extra) on top of the noodles, pork, and broth. After trying both, I prefer Ramen Kid. The ramen here is better in almost every aspect. The broth is much richer and thicker and the noodles have texture without tasting doughy. The pork was tender and pretty good overall. The gyoza is also not bad, although it didn't exactly blow my mind. But I cannot emphasize enough how savory the broth was. It was bitterly cold that day, and god the rich taste and fragrance of that savory bowl of noodles and broth was delicious. Also, it's really not that expensive.  Hopefully this might have helped you decide where to go. The ramen at Ramen Kid is better than at Umami, but Umami has better things other than ramen. What you end up preferring will depend on what you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"So far have been here twice And loved it. I think this would be a wonderful, interesting date place. The decor is primarily anime/manga + other hallmarks of Japanese and/or Asian culture in general. For the state street/Downtown Madison area, this is a unique concept restaurant that I hope will develop and enjoy more success in the future. If you've ever had ramen at Mitsuwa market in Arlington heights, IL, this is as close as it gets in Madison.  As for the pricing, I paid 10$ for the spicy miso combo w side which is reasonable given the large quantity of food that is given.   I've ordered the spicy miso ramen both times, which is not necessarily spicy (just more flavorful) and if you like it even hotter, just ask! They will provide sriracha and Japanese hot pepper. The first time I ordered gyoza as a combo side. The second time I ordered curry rice.  If you are starving, order the curry rice on the side. It is essentially rice with a huge portion of curry.  Although some have commented that the service is not up to par, I actually think it was pretty good given the fact that they are currently understaffed and are training new employees.   I would say give it six months and they will have great, consistent service. (Maybe I'm biased;) they forgot my curry rice and to make up for it, they gave me a whole plate of extra ramen noodle...with the curry rice at the end)   Overall-cute place with potential!"}
{"text":"Tried the spicy tonkatsu .Was just average. Braised pork was tasty but the ground spicy pork in the broth was bit too oily.  The takoyaki(octopus fritters) appetizer was good."}
{"text":"I'm really torn on the rating for this place. If I were rating just based off food, it would be an easy 4-star, but the service was just atrocious.  I came in here with two friends and my boyfriend. One of my friends, who was from Pennsylvania, had never had ramen from a ramen shop so that HAD to be fixed. I hadn't been to Ramen Kid before this day, but I had heard it was the best in town.   We were seated promptly and our order was taken fairly quickly. The takoyaki balls were delicious. The octopus was more chewy than I generally prefer, but it wasn't too bad. The ramen took a bit longer to get out to the table than the appetizer. Not too long, but enough to notice. The ramen was delicious. It's not quite as good as the ramen I got from Muramoto during one of their specials, but it is better than any other ramen place in town. There's a lot of flavor and the pork was cooked perfectly.  After getting our ramen is when things went downhill. We sat around waiting for someone to come back to our table, but no one ever did. We had to flag some one down to order their red bean dessert thing. It took about 30 minutes to get it and when we did it was fishy. I ended up eating the red bean paste and leaving the cake part. We couldn't ever flag some one down for a check even though other tables got their's.  My group went up to the front to check out and it was way too crowded for that to be a thing. The person splitting our check didn't speak English so it made it really hard to figure out.  I would love to come back here and have a better experience, but until they get a better staff I don't think that's going to happen."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for lunch on Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is right off of Gilman and Johnson, so parking is tricky depending on when you go. The interior of the restaurant is cute and has a Japanese feel with an American touch. The walls are plastered with Anime and Miyazaki stickers and memorabilia, which was fun guessing which sticker belonged to which show while we were waiting.  Service was dependent on how many people were there. There is one server, and she was either very busy or not (no happy medium). We came when the restaurant was pretty full, so we found the service a tad spotty.   Food was pretty good (especially for the price!). For $7.50, I received hot ramen with pork, egg, and broth. I was slightly disappointed that my soft boiled egg's yolk was hard, but it didn't take away from the meal. My boyfriend and I ordered the Tonkatsu (his was spicy and $0.50 more expensive). I preferred his over mine, so if you like spice, definitely opt for the spicy option. I wish there were more veggies (mushroom, cilantro, onions, sprouts, and ESPECIALLY seaweed), so I found the broth lacking.  Fried dumplings were alright, but if we were going to get another combo, we would order the extra noodles option instead of dumplings. Overall, I wasn't blown away, but I had a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I just want to up my rating since I've been to pretty much every other ramen place in the area now.   Although the service is still not the best, the menu is pretty reasonably priced and the tonkatsu ramen (or spicy tonkatsu) is delicious. The broth is creamy and most importantly, not too salty! Menu is expanding and has a lot of great choices. The other items (like curry rice on the side) are very reasonable too. Seaweed salad does not have too much seaweed but is a fun side. Come here for the food and the reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Stopped here yesterday on my way to study  and ordered take out. It's clean but crowded because although many people haven't been, I did see many regulars who go there so frequently they know the menu by heart. I am no ramen expert, but hey it tasted great to me. I got the spicy pork miso ramen and egg rolls. The only complaint I have is that the broth is very salty, but the ingredients Taste fresh and the service is friendly, quick, and helpful. It's set up more like a diner which is nice because in a way it's fast food and you go in you sit down you chat you drink you slurp up your ramen and you head out. They have both Japanese and Wisconsin beers, plus a sake machine (clearly lots of college kids come through) I didn't drink because I had hw but I am definitely going back to try it. Lots of odd knock knacks sitting around that are fun to look at while you wait. As log As yore the type of person who likes Chinese and Japanese food, I recommend it. It's certainly better than umami (my friend got food poisoning there)"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! They are very reasonably priced (which I guess you have to be if you are on the college campus). The tonkotsu ramen is one of the best I've had outside of NYC. Really liked this place. The shio ramen was okay, a little too bland but I can see why people like it. Definitely would give this place a try, Ramen Kid and Umami are probably similar in taste. The advantage of ramen kid being that it's much cheaper."}
{"text":"Worst ramen experience ever. Take out two ramen noodles. No bamboo, no seaweed, no meat!!!! The packed food was placed on the counter for 10 mins until final served!!"}
{"text":"A great little Ramen shop! The atmosphere is bright and modern, small tables make it feel intimate and cozy.    The corn butter and spicy pork Ramen are both incredible. Rich broth and great toppings with every bowl! The combo with some gyoza is a great deal.  It's the kind of place you can eat pretty frequently and not run out of things to try because their menu changes somewhat often."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ramen shop in the area thus far. Recently their bowls are smaller, which is a disappointment, but the price is still good and the ramen is delicious! I always get the tonkatsu ramen, which is rich with excellent noodles and broth. The beef bowl is also an amazingly delicious non-ramen entree, and I often get the ramen to eat there and the beef bowl to go because it makes such a great lunch the next day and I really can't choose between the two! The onions in the beef bowl are irresistible!   I've never had any problems with service here as others seem to- they leave you alone for the most part but it isn't hard to get someone's attention if you need something."}
{"text":"After one week Ramen Kid opened their door for business I went for lunch today. Well, it's much better than the other ramen place on Willy St. But for the serious ramen lovers, it's not bad, just don't compare the ramen you had from restaurant outside of Madison WI. I tried their Tonkotsu & Shoyu Ramen, and their Pork Katsu. I would recommend their Tonkotsu Ramen. They ran out of Miso and Spicy Miso this morning. Raman Kid have a great potential to be a good ramen place in Madison but they have some kinks to workout in their kitchen. The broth for the Tonkotsu was not hot enough this morning and the cooks forgot to put chasu on couple customer's ramen.   The best asset in the restaurant this morning was a young high-school Japanese waitress. She knows more about ramen than the two cooks in the kitchen. Overall Ramen Kid has a great potential. I love the bold Anime inspired decor, service was good, but the cooks in the kitchen have a lot to improve. I hope the owner Aki will work out the kinks in the kitchen before I come back to try my second bowl of ramen soon."}
{"text":"Solid ramen place in Madison. We had takeout spicy and regular tonkotsu. A little cheaper than Umami on Williamson and almost as good quality. Noodles and broth were great but the meat was a little tough. Great that they do ramen takeout, which Umami does not."}
{"text":"I had the spicy Tonkotsu ramen, and even though it was good, there were some things that I didn't really like about the dish. The egg was overcooked which was disappointing, the spicy sauce was not really spicy, and the broth was just okay. I really liked the texture of the noddles however, and I did enjoy my plate. The service even though nice was not very attentive and we had to wait a very long time for our dishes. I really loved the atmosphere of the place however and the music even though unusual was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, was just after it opened. I guess people hadnt figured out it existed yet and thus, food came quick enough, and although they got my order wrong I couldnt complain because it was good nevertheless.  The second time...upon enterring, the claustrophobia kicked in. Too many groups of unattended people all chilling by the door and it took 15 minutes just for someone to acknowledge me. Then, after specifically requesting not to be seated at the bar (eating within elbow touching distance of strangers? No thank you!) I was hustled to the bar 5 minutes later.  After waiting OVER AN HOUR (for instant noodles, mind you....this should never ever take this long), I finally lost all patience and got up and left. Refund was not offered.   All in all, unless youre with a group of friends who have a hell of a lot to talk about and think just-okay instant noodles are worth an hour plus wait, avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I used to love Ramen Kid when they first opened. The food was amazing and reasonably priced. After some time they raised prices, but the food was still awesome. Last time I went there I was very excited about the food, and I was willing to pay the price. However, the food was awful, and they had really low quality ingredients. The service was terrible too. The waitress had a bad attitude and it seemed like she did not want to help us. I'm not coming again."}
{"text":"Love that there's a great ramen place in town!  Staff is all nice and friendly.  Can't wait to come back.  The soup is delicious and if I'm super hungry I like a little curry katsu to go with it.  Can never have enough yummies especially when it's chilly out.  Thanks Ramen Kid!"}
{"text":"Their menu is wrong online and when I called to order something the girl on the phone was extremely rude and unhelpful. It was enough to make me never want to eat here."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience!! The food was amazing and the service was top notch. I ate the spicy pork ramen with a side of curry rice. The spice was just right and the flavors were extremely unique. Thanks for the great dinner. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was really good. I really enjoyed my Spicy Miso Ramen with Tofu. The taste was just unreal and the tofu was amazing. I loved the broth and could have probably had two bowls of ramen. I think the next time that I could here I would like to try one of their curry dishes. Yum!  Wait times for food were a bit long, but I can overlook it for the quality of food. I wouldn't come here on a busy Fri/Sat night though because I can see the wait time for food getting long."}
{"text":"Easily the best ramen I've had outside my own home.  I personally had the spicy tonkotsu.  The serving was fairly large, consisting of 2 slices of melt in your mouth pork, a large heap of noodles and a decent amount of veg, and half an egg.  The broth was flavorful and as to be expected a little spicy.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and there's was plenty of them.  And the pork was almost too soft, it was difficult to pick up without it falling apart.  The place had a nice atmosphere, very casual, making for a great lunch location.  It was beautifully decorated catering to the otaku of the area with most of the pictures being from anime without ruining the experience for other visitors."}
{"text":"Love this place. It has a great vibe and friendly staff. Service is a little slow but i dont mind.  Food is great! The best and affordable ramen i had in town and ive been to most Japanese spots in town. The broth is flavorful and not super salty. If you stop buy, be sure to order some Takoyaki and some Sopporo while you wait for the delicious Ramen!"}
{"text":"Great ramen. Had the spicy miso and spicy tonkotsu. Only wish is that they were more spicy!"}
{"text":"There's a New Kid on the Block slinging out bowls of ramen to a receptive audience.  After my recent visit to the Ramen Kid, would I be crooning \"Baby You Got It\" about my experience, or would \"Single\" (as in a single Yelp star) be more apropos?  Other than a new sign, the pale brick exterior of the restaurant has changed little from its previous incarnation as the Lava Lounge, so don't expect to be blown away when you first lay eyes on the establishment.  However, the interior is another story, as the owner has done an effective job converting the former night club into a proper ramen shop.  It's a long, narrow space and despite limited natural light, the interior is well illuminated.  The anime collage above the open, stainless steel kitchen, the Japanese calligraphy on the dining room walls and the multicolored paper umbrellas all set the proper mood for the Japanese themed eatery.  The matching tables and chairs along with the neat stacks of red, white and black bowls and plates stacked on the bar reinforce the sense of order inside the restaurant.  The fairly loud background music sounded fairly unique - it sounded like Japanese pop to my uneducated ear.  While there are still rough spots to the interior décor (a hastily painted false ceiling, a grungy looking mirror behind the kitchen cooler), overall the new incarnation was generally well executed.    Ramen Kid offers counter service. The engaging cashier deftly guided me as I navigated the limited menu for the first time.  The kitchen delivered my steaming bowl of deliciousness in slightly more than five minutes, which was greatly appreciated, as Madison was in the grips of the a particularly virulent Polar Vortex and the steam from the bowl had revived both body and soul that encounter.  Because the restaurant was not particularly busy during my visit, I had the runner, the cook and older gentleman who I assumed was the owner ask me what I thought of my lunch.  The menu includes over a half dozen ramen options, a pair of stir-fried noodle dishes and several different curry bowls.  For appetizers, there are a variety of dumplings, calamari, kara-age (fried chicken bites) and edamame.  The restaurant also offers a limited beer and wine menu.  After consulting the staff, I wisely decided to go with the popular Tonkatsu (marinated soft boiled egg, green onions, bamboo shoot and pork chashu).  The intensely savory broth had a soothing depth of flavor, extremely satisfying on its own and the salt level was spot on.  My bowl brimmed with a generous quantity of slurpilicious noodles.  The soft boil egg added a nice visual element but flavor-wise, it seemed lost in the other components of the dish.  I was pleased with the quantity of the under-seasoned pork chashu, however, I wished it was portioned into smaller pieces.  Overall, I'm extremely excited to have a ramen shop joining Madison's food scene and look forward to further exploration of their menu."}
{"text":"Bad service. Waited for nearly an hour for my ramen because they skipped my order and another half hour for my appetizers."}
{"text":"With a lot of other Ramen-themed restaurants popping up, I wanted to give them all a try to find out which were my favorites.  The ramen was not bad!  I had the Mabo Tofu, which had tofu, eggplant, and other veggies, but wasn't very brothy (more creamy). The noodles were not as thick as I would have liked, almost like your store bought ramen packet noodles. I liked the flavor a lot, but wasn't as big a fan of the consistency.  My boyfriend had the Tonkatsu which was nice and brothy, but then lacked in pork flavor.   I'm bummed because this place generally has great reviews! Maybe we just didn't get the right dishes, but overall I'd say the ramen was okay. It didn't blow me away, but I'd definitely consider trying it again!"}
{"text":"All around solid ramen place. I got takeout and it was worth it. Much better than I thought it would be to be honest. Coming from LA, I've had great ramen, I didn't know what to expect in Wisconsin but I was pleasantly surprised. If I'm ever out here again I would definitely repeat."}
{"text":"It's nice that there's a ramen place on campus, but compared to the other ramen I had, this place is pretty average. I say this because the broth isn't rich and thick like what other people say; to me it's kinda really bland and doesn't taste like much. I mean you can add flavoring, but it just isn't the same as broth that's already really good. I would also say that the yakisoba isn't bad, and I would get that over the ramen anytime. For the price, this place isn't a horrible option... But there are definitely places that have better ramen than this."}
{"text":"I have never left a review before, but I was so impressed by Ramen Kid I felt compelled to.  If you're wondering if Ramen Kid is better than Umami, I'd definitely say it is.  From the second we walked in, the staff was incredibly attentive and friendly. Having worked food service before, it was clear that everyone was legitimately interested in making sure we had a good experience. Everyone who passed our table asked if we were doing alright. That may seem excessive, but I cannot emphasize enough that everyone was so genuine it felt really natural. At one point, we were offered drinks to thank us for coming and trying it out. I mean, how nice is that?  I got the miso veggie ramen with the rice curry combo and the person I was with (Jake, for future reference) got the tonkatsu ramen with the gyoza combo. It was a lot of really good food for a more-than-reasonable price. The broth smelled great and tasted rich. The curry was thick with just a tiny bit of heat. Jake said the pork practically melted in his mouth. I tried the gyoza and the sauce had the perfect amount of heat (enough to notice, not enough to burn).  Everyone in the restaurant thanked us and told us to have a good night as we left, cooks and front-of-house staff. I will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"Ramen Kid is a newly opened restaurant in the heart of Madison. I had been waiting for it to open since I saw the location being renovated and was excited to try out Madison's second ramen restaurant. This is my first review on Yelp because I was so appalled at my experience there.  Upon entering the restaurant, the atmosphere did not feel welcoming because as new customers, my girlfriend and I did not know what to expect or do. Was I supposed to find my own seat, wait to be seated, or order at the counter and retrieve my food later? Eventually after waiting 15 minutes in the front alongside other loitering customers, the waitress guided us to our seat. The look of the restaurant is that of a typical ramen bar, nothing special besides the manga comic pictures above the bar. It was not spacious and some tables were very close together.   The waitress asked for our drinks and then minutes later took our order. We ordered the Takoyaki to share as an appetizer then ordered the Tonkotsu and Kara-age Curry as our entree. The time it took for our food to come to our table was incredibly disappointing, it was an upwards of 30 minutes. Our appetizer ended up being the last thing to come to our table. Later on during our meal, I witnessed another customer receiving their food late with a side of an apology from the waitress, just like we had.   The Takoyaki came with 5 pieces, each of which had only small piece of octopus inside a ball filled mostly tasteless batter. I had a taste of the Kara-age Curry, but it did not wow me at all. The item tasted like generic Japanese curry with chicken and a side of sliced ginger. The only good thing about the curry was the portion size was large. My entree was Japan's signature Tonkotsu. The first thing I noticed that there was an absurd amount of noodles compared to the meat, egg, and bamboo shoots. There were only handful of shoots and only two small slices of meat. The broth tasted bland and I ended up not finishing it. The egg wasn't prepared as well as other ramen places, instead it was more of a typical boiled egg, this left me disappointed as it is one of my favorite parts of eating ramen.  I will not be going to Ramen Kid again in the near future as the terrible service and mediocre quality has left a bad impression on me for the time being. I do see potential for improvement as it is in a good location. Once they are staffed better and become better prepared for busy nights as well as improvement in food quality, they will be heading in a positive direction."}
{"text":"I think it's great ramen place. The price is right :)! Owned by Japanese.  ???????????????????"}
{"text":"We've been waiting for Ramen Kid to open for weeks. On a cold, blustery day, a hot bowls of pork tonkatsu, soy sauce ramen, & teriyaki chix hit the spot. Service was friendly. It was cool hearing them offer the mailman lunch, but he was in a rush today with a smile responding with, \"...next time, I promise.\""}
{"text":"This gets four stars for being what I wanted - ramen in walking distance that I could take to-go. I had a huge craving for ramen and had never tried this place, which is very near my apartment, so I walked. The inside is very unassuming. I asked for one spicy ramen (can't remember if it was miso or tonkotsu) to-go. I waited about ten minutes. They separated it into two containers, one for the noodles and one for the broth, and altogether it made for a pretty huge portion. It was not quite as spicy as I wanted it to be so I added a little hot sauce, but it was a generally delicious bowl of ramen and I would go back (probably only for take-out)."}
{"text":"This is a must!!  I was excited to hear Madison finally got a true Ramen house.   Son and I tried it out this Saturday afternoon.  I was so anxious to try it, I forgot to photograph our meals.    We ordered the spicy miso, veg, and tonkatsu ramen. All were excellent. The servings were plentiful, hot and presented in an appetizing manner.    The goyza are to die for.  I would say the best I have had in Madison.  They do offer other noodle type dishes if you not in the soul mood.    The establishment is in inviting.  It's my understanding, this use to be some type of night club/bar.  You would not know that from the remodel.  The outside sign doesn't really standout to grab your attention, so be on the lookout for it when seeking this place. Seating is limited. Each table only holds two, however, tables can be slid together to accommodate larger groups.  I would go with a very large group or you may find your self standing.  They do have counter seating if your by your self.   As everything downtown, parking is either on the street or about a block up there is a small lot."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time in a freezing night.  The place is very small with not too many tables. And there are lots of people, maybe because of the cold weather(?)   I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and takoyaki. The soup was very nice, creamy and tasty, and not too salty. And I enjoyed the noodles a lot. The pork chashu was ok, a little bit dry, but that's a leafy a good deal for Madison. I very much enjoyed my first try of takoyaki! It was like a mouthful of octopus mixed with mayo and other sauces. Crispy on the outside but creamy (and hot) in the inside.   For an extra $2.5 you can make a combo of your ramen, which you can choose from deep fried gyozas (very crispy), curry rice (a huge bowl) or extra noodles.  The dishes all come in a big portion and the prices are reasonable.  The only complaint is really about their slow service..."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this simple: I love Ramen Kid. I was just in Japan in November, and the place I keep coming back to remind myself of the tastes and smells of Japanese comfort food is Ramen Kid.  I love how the menu keeps changing all the time, with the chef regularly rolling out new ramen combinations.  I love the karaage (fried chicken, classic pub food in Japan) and the takoyaki (fried octopus balls - Ramen Kid was the first place I ever tried and I think the only place in Madison to serve it) and the spicy tonkotsu ramen.  And I love that I get to practice a bit of Japanese.  A friend of mine and I recently went on a ramen tour of Madison to find the best ramen.  Honestly, I think Morris Ramen has the best ramen.  But Ramen Kid cannot be beat for the combination of casual Japanese dining ambience and pretty good ramen.  Now when I think of comfort food on a cold Wisconsin day, I think of Ramen Kid."}
{"text":"This review is up for editing, BUT for now it is a solid 5. As a native of the Philippines, I have yet to find a place selling good Takoyaki. THIS PLACE DOES. Pro-Tip: this is obvious; get three orders of Takoyaki instead of one. You'll over eat, but that's okay."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, however, the service is terrible. When I went I asked if I could substitute the soft-boiled egg in my ramen, for the seaweed, since they are both the same price. The waitress said yes, and then charged me the full price for the seaweed. I told her this, and she told me that it was my fault for not understanding her. Clearly she doesn't know what \"substitute\" means. Also, the music was very loud and all bad techno. When the person I was eating with asked if it could be changed, or even just skipped one track, the waitress said no. The waitstaff at this restaurant should be given more autonomy to make these kinds of decision. There was also extremely little meat in one of the ramen bowls at our table. Additionally, even though almost every other table was open, I was seated next to the only other customers in the restaurant. The tables were barely a foot apart. Would order take out in the future because the food is good and not too expensive, but I would not dine in."}
{"text":"Updated after several months and 5 more visits. Food remains outstanding, but service is always HORRIBLE. We went this Saturday afternoon (12/10/2016) and my husband had to go and get his own soda refills, twice. Waitress just stood at the counter and watched, never said a thing. TV was showing some weird Sci-Fi show with lots of gore. Pretty bad. This place seems to be missing a lot of opportunities. We would come here more often if the service was even half way better than what it is now."}
{"text":"After seeing all the buzz on this relatively new restaurant, I decided to venture over on a frigid winter night.  The space is simple with a counter, a dining room, and a sushi bar-like sitting area. It's not brand new, but still kept up very well.  I ventured outside the ramen atmosphere and got the vege curry. The curry sauce was EXCELLENT, but the vegetables that came on top looked like they were from a frozen bag. All in all, it was a hearty meal for $7.  My friend got the pork ramen and loved it. Ramen is definitely a hit at this place and I won't make the same mistake when I go back. The one disappointing aspect of our visit was that they no longer have the green bean appetizers (which look great in the other photos).  Either way, the other Yelpers have it right; this place is a great deal with excellent ramen!"}
{"text":"Parking is too hard to find, seating is very cramped. Noodle/Ramen tastes Okay w/ average or above noodle soup. Serving portion is below average and I would be hungry after one bowl. The menu is a bit terrible to use, most things listed I had a hard time to understand. I would either use just plain Japanese or actual English, the way it is now makes ordering extremely frustrating to me. Oh, the service, terrible when I was there last time, it took forever for the servers/waitress to realize that she is supposed to take our orders. And we definitely did not get one of the dishes ordered until the very end if the dinner - which means it was never carried to the kitchen staff until we ASKED where that thing is."}
