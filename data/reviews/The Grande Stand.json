{"text":"What a nice find!  Tucked into the corner of a large strip mall on 73rd Street and Shea area to the east of the theaters, this burger place is phenomenal. Made from scratch ingredients and freshly ground meat add to the delicious-ness of the hamburger. We had a fresh peach lemonade to start followed by their Standard Burger... so good, moist, flavorful, cooked to perfection and very filling. Wonderful staff, very informative and pleasant, added to the experience of this clean and bright restaurant.  Will definitely go again. and try more of their diverse menu!"}
{"text":"New spot from Arcadia!  Friendly staff. The Burger was delish.  Cheesy goodness w/ onions, cheese, and a double burger. Hubby had the sonoran hotdog which he liked. Our daughter had the chicken tinga taco.  And then ordered another. Fries were good by their report and we liked the mexican corn.  Ron, the GM, has a great personality!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly I've lived on this block for the last 27 years and was excited to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood. Have been in multiple times to give it another chance. Food is sadly delicious but the service ruins it every single time. The owner is rude and obnoxious. I've been charged three different prices for the exact same thing. When I asked why I was being charged differently for it I could hear the owner and two servers complaining I was trying to freeload them over one item. So if you enjoy being talked negatively about by the people serving you and the owner of the company your spending your money in them do yourself the favor and stop in and be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service was the best I've ever had, they took care of us every step of the way. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Burger was amazing and so were the fries! The sauce that came on the side was incredible as well. Didn't know what to really expect, as I was brought there by someone who has gone to the original location. Very impressed and was happy."}
{"text":"Excellent place to grab a delicious burger or hot dog. When we go, my wife typically orders the Royals with cheese and Jalape√±os, my son gets a cheeseburger, and I get the Sonoran Hot Dog. I do love the Royals, but I must say, if you're looking for a good dog, I don't think you'll find one better. If I were you, I'd go...just not when I'm there! Keep the lines short for me!"}
{"text":"This location is open and amazing!! 11/18/2017
The hotdogs are great! The tacos are good. We are never disappointed when we come in. The sevice is also outstanding."}
{"text":"Service: atrocious 
Food: mediocre 
There are any number of other restaurants in the valley with far superior burgers. The mediocre food aside, the service alone will stop us from ever going here again. When we were seated, it took over 10 minutes and flagging down two people for someone to finally stop to help our table. The food arrived in a fairly reasonable amount of time. However, when we finished, it took over 25 minutes to get the check - after 20 minutes of waiting, one of us got up and asked someone for the check, it then took about 10 minutes more to get the check paid (over 5 to get it after getting up and asking for it). We were not the only people in the restaurant with a similar issue - we saw one gentleman get up and ask the manager to help them because they had been ignored, the table next to us had been there for probably close to 15 minutes before they got their drinks, and at least one other table of people appeared to be frustrated with the timing of their service."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to go check this place out! Just had lunch there and everything was delicious! Their standard cheeseburger is amazing, it's now definitely one of the top best burgers I've ever had! We also tried the royale burger and it was also great! Definitely coming back to try their tacos and hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Great Authentic Tacos And The Burger Was Just As Delicious!!!
Hospitality Was Just As Superb As The Food!!!
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place, and I swear you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Stopped there after the show. Delicious double cheese burgers, you could tell the meat used was quality. Burgers came with a nice sauce. Everything was ala carte. We ordered the fries which were fresh cut string fries. I thought the price for carmalized onions was too high, most places don't charge. Good service. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"So excited they have a location up here ! So happy for them to expand :) a little different here than ours down on Indian school -- sit down service but still incredible food and of course friendly service"}
{"text":"I came here before a movie, expecting nothing special. I had the Royale burger, and it was tremendous. The service was nice and friendly, and the place was clean. I am glad that there is a new good spot to eat in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we stopped here for a quick lunch yesterday. We got here about 3:00 PM and had the restaurant to ourselves.

Quickly we were greeted by our waiter Quentin, a young man with a great smile and attitude. With the basic menu offerings of hot dogs and hamburgers there wasn't that overwhelming feeling you sometimes feel when a menu is too large.

We asked about the flavored iced tea and horchata and he offered nicely to bring us two small shot glasses of each for a taste. While I love a good horchata, I was in the mood for the cool taste of the hibiscus colored tea. After tasting both, the flavored tea won. It had nice green tea and mango notes as it was a unusual tasting and refreshing.

I really was intrigued by the Mexican street corn AKA corn on the cob but my hubby and I agreed that I couldn't eat a whole order and that sharing one cob would be awkward, so Quentin suggested that we have the order served in a small container coupled with an order of guacamole. When the order arrived we didn't know what to expect.

One bite of the corn and guac on the warm, nicely shaped chips and we were in heaven. The corn had a mixture of warm spices and tasted just right with the side of guac. As far as the guac, it was nice and fresh (not browning) and had a hint of lemon. Strange as it sounds it was a good starter for the hot dogs that were coming our way.

We ordered two All American hot dogs, one loaded with onions and one not. For $5.00 you cannot beat what you get for one hot dog. The hot dog was served on a healthy and robust bun (lightly toasted with a slick coat of butter) and the dog itself was cooked just right, not too tender and not overly grilled. I took one bite of mine (sans onion) and wanted to just gobble it up quickly as all the flavors were exploding in my mouth. DELISH.

All in all it was a great lunch meal, fairly reasonable, the service excellent and we know we will def be back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  
Hamburger, Mexican corn, fries.... all are amazing!  
Will def return."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious with quick service. Get one of their shakes, you won't be disappointed. A new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"We spent 10 minutes without a word because the burgers were that good!!! Cucumber martini was great and the milkshakes are an awesome walking around dessert... definitely worth it before the movies!"}
{"text":"WOW! We just left the movie's and wanted to grab a bite nearby....looked across the plaza and saw The Grand Stand. The menu frankly looked kinda sparse, but we figured we'd give it a try.
   Let me just say...wow, wow, WOW! 
The El Pastor Taco was awesome! Perfect blend of flavors especially with the Stands special sauce. My husbands burger was superb and not overcooked.The hand cut fries seriously gave me a mouthgasm. Perfect in every way! Our waiter Jeb was the best and said next time we would have to try their homemade shakes.
   Well knowing my husband and his love of ice cream I said come on honey let's split a vanilla shake...best decision I ever made...Husband said it was the best shake he had ever had! I am completely in love with The Grand Stand. They may not have a huge menu but what they do have is custom made with the finest ingredients. Can't wait to find another movie to go to at Shea so I can get my fix at The Grand Stand!"}
{"text":"We love this place! We are regulars...love the hog dogs and the banana milkshake is to die for!"}
{"text":"We have wanted to try their original location on Indian School, but, kept forgetting. So, we were pleased to have a location in Scottsdale. We decided to try both their tacos and the burgers. The burger is moist, cheesy and delious. It comes with prickles and onions. It is a flat top cooked burger which creates a crust on the burger, and includes their special sauce. We got the hand cut fries, which were equally excellent. We also tried their tacos, getting both the chicken and the vegetable ones. They were sold out of the short-rib tacos and the taco pastoure, which was disappointing for a Saturday night. The chicken taco was excellent. They are small, about 4+ inches, so order several. They were moist and flavorable. They offer three different salsas, and , we tried them all. The medium was just o.k., fresh, but not exciting. The pico de gallo was freshly made and very good, but, mild. Their \" hot \"was spicy, fresh, and, our favorite. It gave the tacos a nice zing. They also have beer, wine and cocktails. The service was very good.  We would definately return...."}
{"text":"THEY ARE NOT CLOSED FOR BUSINESS.  Burgers are spectacular as are the fries.  Really enjoyed the hot dog as well.  I will edit my review soon, but wanted to get something up ASAP to let people know this is a mistake and that we should support this new place that has such high quality offerings."}
{"text":"Best fries I have ever had.  The family also had the chips and salsa, and they were VERY fresh.   Great burgers overall.  I am glad they have something closer than the Arcadia location.  Priced pretty fairly.  Service was great, they were very attentive and made sure everything was to our liking."}
{"text":"The new location is awesome and the food is spot on. They also serve alcoholic beverages which is a major plus!"}
{"text":"I love The Stand on Indian School and go there often. I was so excited when I saw this had opened on Shea. After passing by last Sunday, I stopped in to order 3 burgers to go at the bar counter. The server asked if I'd like a drink and I said no, thinking I would be in and out. Mind you, very few people were in the restaurant when I arrived, 2-3 parties max. Well, over 25 minutes later I see the manager ask the server what I'm waiting for, he immediately acknowledges me from the kitchen, yelling over that there was an issue, but my food was coming up soon. Well, I think after 40-45 minutes total I received my food from the same server. No apology or anything, just put my bag on the counter, and I had tipped when I first ordered. I was really disappointed that the server never acknowledged my wait, or offered me a drink after sitting there for 45 minutes waiting for 3 burgers. Honestly, it was a super disappointing experience and I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, suburb service, great experience!  

My wife and I really enjoyed this place, it should be busier than it is.  Sonoran dogs and street tacos were on our menu and they were great.  Topped off by the manager letting us try out the Dulce de Leche drink that was really sinfully great.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best food ever!!! If we could eat here every day we would. My boyfriend says it's the best burger in town and he has a big appetite LOL Best service and so amazing at catering to the customers needs! When we came back from Cancun this is our first stop we were craving the burgers so badly! Thank you! We are weekly visitors."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try The Grande Stand and finally made it last night. We tried almost everything and it was ALL GOOD! Super fresh, hot, and tasty! We had the burger, Sonoran hotdog, veggie tacos, fries, chips & salsa, and a shake. Yum!"}
{"text":"Mostly empty at 6 pm, The Stand, in the Shea Scottsdale Center, seemed so unassuming and disappointing as I walked up but immediately thought twice after being greeted by a wonderful staff, enthusiastic and confident about their food. 
I have to say the staff made the place interesting before we even sat down. Short rib, pulled pork and chicken tacos were ordered.  Hamburgers, Mexican street corn and hand-cut fries; all delicious. The Short rib tacos took top honors but the show stealer was the salted Dulce de Leche Shake. So over-the-top delicious was this blend of caramel, sea salt and hand spun vanilla ice cream with a straw that could handle it while still cold and thick, that next time I'll order the Shake first and have the tacos as an afterthought! Glad this location is still mostly undiscovered.... no wait on a Thursday night. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Go to the Grande Stand! Burger was amazing! They hand grind their meat daily here. I had a beer with my burger,  but next time I'm getting a hand spun milk shake! Go big or go home, right? Easy to see why they have the \"best\" burger"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would terrible service 20 minutes not even water. They just kept smiling at us as the line got longer. They finally seated us and took our order then ,10 more minutes not even our water. Got up and left."}
{"text":"Looks like almost the same exact menu as the original location, so they could have added something new. The price for a piece of corn is almost $5 which is way too high. In this restaurant setting, the menu is stupidly small - they should just make it order at counter with just six or seven items. The food we did order was still good. The chicken tacos had alot of tinga flavored white meat chicken and the short rib tacos were loaded with good meat and pickled red onions too. The fries can be shared and at $3.50 are a good deal for a hand cut version. The stand sauce is also worth the extra 50 cents, although the extra charge really is a bit greedy. Nice staff. Place was empty at about 8pm on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"Great selection of wine, delicious milkshakes, and fabulous burgers/fries! These people know what they are doing. Gluten free friendly menu! Literally the best burger I've had in years!!! My boyfriend ate a regular burger and had the same feedback: BOMB.COM! Sooooooo much better than Hopdoddy. The Grande Stand is going to be one of our \"go to\" options for date night. Thank you for the fabulous meal and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this was a Zipps burger and fries at twice the price.  Burger and fries were hot and fresh just like Zipps.  Fries plated with a mini shovel which is cute but just a gimmick.  Not going back.  Will go to Zipps"}
{"text":"My family dined at the grande stand after watching a move and it was amazing! We had eaten at the original location in Arcadia and this one did not disappoint. I had the short rib and al pastor tacos and they were delicious! My husband had the burger and my kids the hot dog.  Everyone enjoyed the meal.  You MUST get the banana milkshake.  It's the BEST shake I've EVER had!!!  The entire staff was so friendly accommodating.  I can't wait to go back and eat there again!"}
{"text":"Amazing food .... highly recommended.... the food is delicious as when the original location opened.  The food has stayed consistent and great.   Must try.   Wish the indian school location would continue with tacos.   Was sad to see that pulled..."}
{"text":"I'm really confused by the reviews here. 

This place, right outside of a movie theater in a row of about 1/2 dozen other quick bite type places in a strip mall. They have that sort of 50s vibe. Shakes and burgers. and Gucci \"street tacos\" and \"Sonoran hot dogs\". Ok. That's a little strange but ok.  Don't forget the \"Mexican street corn\". Lol. 

Anyway. The place was clean and the staff very friendly. It's odd going to a burger stand that has white table napkins but ok. I'm still with it. They even have a hostess who opens the door for you. 

But here is where it goes wrong for me. 

I had the standard burger with cheese. Could have been great but here's the thing. I don't care for double meat burgers when the meet is paper thin.  It's the same reason I don't like in n out. And I really don't care for American cheese. And the special sauce, I should have known to ask for mustard and catsup instead. I've been to in n out. I know the drill.   But. I should have asked what the special sauce was. Meh. I knew what it was.  My bad. 

The street corn was a suggestion by the server. It also could have been wonderful. But it wasn't. I'm pretty sure \"Mexican street corn\" is cooked on a grill then slathered in junk to add flavors that are complementary to grilled foods. When the corn is boiled, those seasonings just don't come together right.  They just lay on top of bland boiled corn. 

Anyway. That's my two cents. 

Probably a good place for a 17 year old to take his movie date, if kids still do that...  I think that's what their going for. A nice place with white cloth napkins and average grill food with milk shakes. Or margaritas. Lol. 

Oh. And it didn't slip my mind that my ice tea was never refilled. 

Atmosphere. 4 stars
Burger. 3 stars
\"Mexican street corn\". 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great and reasonably priced restaurant. Had the Sonoran dog and it was excellent. They use a quarter pound dog and not one you would typically use for a Sonoran dog so bring your appetite. The dog has good snap and nice blend of seasoning. The bun held up well, which can be a problem with Sonoran dogs. The wife said the corn was good. Menu is a bit eclectic but definitely in a good way. I love the restaurant trying to do something different. Restaurant was clean and the bathrooms were well taken care of, particularly for you Yelpers with little ones. There are not a lot of options for a Sonoran dog in Scottsdale but despite the lack of competition this one still stands out as a solid dog."}
{"text":"Delicious food and shakes! Definitely give the salted caramel shake a try. I feel like this place isn't being discovered by the Scottsdale populous and it's a shame! Better than Hop Daddy right around the corner. Maybe it's Amy's curse..."}
{"text":"So I really wanted to give this place 3 1/2 stars, but opted for 3 just because I thought the staff was off their game a bit. I went for my birthday because my family was in town and I felt like something different. When we got there - a sign informed us that they were going to close in less than an hour (3pm) because of Super Bowl. Didn't realize this was a national holiday and they had a TV behind the counter, but they definitely had the skeleton crew on shift.It almost seemed as if the manager left to watch the game and didn't put anyone in charge!

We were there with children and asked if we could modify one of the kids menu items - we were greeted with a prompt \"no\". Then we asked for no cheese on a strange open faced hotdog sandwich sort of thing for one of the kids...only to have to wait about 40 minutes and have it arrive with cheese. We didn't make a big deal because the kid was going to freak if he realized it had cheese and was already super hungry because we had to wait so long.

In fact, we waited so long that we started to count how many times the staff would walk by the table, not say anything to anyone in the restaurant. They kept walking in circles (literally) and didn't fill a cup nor pick up a dish from anyone. It was sort of comical.

But then came the food...that saved the restaurant. I may have gone down to 2 stars if it weren't for the food. The tacos were FANTASTIC!! Coming from a long line of taco connoisseurs, I can tell when I'm being bamboozled. The short rib tacos and tacos al pastor were the best I've tried in a long time. The charro beans were spectacular as well. 

The only food (or I should say drink) issue I had is when I ordered a Michelada. This is a typical Mexican drink that is sort of a Bloody Mary mixed with beer type of drink. When they brought it to the table, they served the beer separate. This may be a technicality, but it's difficult to drink down sips of the drink and keep adding beer each time. They usually come already mixed together.

All in all, the food was GREAT - but the service needs a much needed upgrade. The servers were so quiet and meek, you almost needed to ask them questions to get served. It's too bad really. The food is some of the best!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.

Just a really well made hamburger, a delicious sonoran hot dog, and great tasting sides. Can never have enough of places just trying to make the best they can make versus being good at a bunch of everything.

Will gladly return again"}
{"text":"Heard about the Grand Stand and decided to give it a try since it's right down the street. Expectations weren't that high and the place was empty. We came on a Sunday night at 7:45pm. 

We ordered the Standard and the Royale. They both come with two patties and on the Standard we added an extra patty. Our waitress, Meghan, suggested we try the Mexican street corn so we did! It was tasty and had the right kick of spice. 

Our burgers came and it looked amazing! THE BEST BURGERS WE HAVE HAD! Meat was perfectly done. Everything was perfect, fries were delicious and at the end we both had their chocolate shakes. I definitely will be back and recommend everyone to try this place."}
{"text":"After our movie let out at 10 PM found this gem was still open!  Cannot even begin to tell you have amazing this place is. Burgers and tacos and shakes OH MY!"}
{"text":"Amy has left the building - it's safe to go in now!  
(see below if that doesn't mean anything to you) 

So - a new burger and dog place in the neighborhood - great!  
Got the Sonoran dog and fries and a drink.  My buddy got the Mexican Street Corn and a couple of tacos.

The good - the food was really good...the service was dandy...the place was clean.

The bad - table-service doesn't make much sense for a hot dog place, IMHO...
With tip, I was out $18 for a dog, fries and a drink...that just doesn't make sense to me.  My compadre was out about the same on the tacos and street corn and a drink.  

So...if I could repeat the experience for $10-$12, I'm in...but $18 prices me out.

(This was previously the site of the infamous Amy's Baking Company - if you don't know the story - find the Kitchen Nightmares episode on Youtube)"}
{"text":"Fun spot for excellent light casual food before/after a movie. I'll drop in for their tacos."}
{"text":"The tacos we ordered were quite small (3inch) and distasteful for $4 each. Also, the hamburgers here were priced at $12 while the hamburgers at the original Stand on Indian School Rd. are $7 (even though they are the same hamburger)."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! We had taco, hot dog and burger all the best! And the salted caramel shake to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Why this place is not packed I will never know.  Awesome food and eager staff make for a great experience.  Great burgers, fries, and beef short rib tacos.  We need to support this new business!  Happy hour 3-6 looks like a great deal too!"}
{"text":"I love the the location in Phoenix so I had to give this place a try. I wasn't that hungry but I'm always down for a a Chocolate Shake and their delicious fries. This location didn't disappoint. :)"}
{"text":"The best place for gluten free food the owner is a great guy and they make some incredible food I would recommend thanks guys"}
{"text":"I give this a 2 star and we have not even eaten yet! We walked and there were many open tables. the hostess asked how many we said 4 and a high chair, she then asked inside or outside we replied with either is good for us. At that time the manager rudely leaned over the bar counter and loudly said it is a 20 min wait, we were on the news yesterday and we are short staffed. Another family walked in and they were told it was a 20 min wait and the manager again rudely commented. By this time I was like wow that is the manager and the hostess kept apologizing for his rudeness. The manger just kept repeating that they were on the news and continued to be rude to the people walking in. At this point I am not even sure I wanna waste my time and eat here .
     We are seated, ordered never received a refill for any drink when our food came the fries were not only hard and cold but there was so few of them. When you spend $12 for a burger and fries you expect fires ! The burgers were good but the rest of the experience was horrible not worth going to again. Five guys is better! 
       But I will say the manager did come to me in the end and comp our entire bill, realizing that he was rude and apologized. So I changed my 2 star to 4. To me it mostly about customer service!"}
{"text":"I've visited The Grande Stand on many occasions now. I have been 100% pleased with the food and service on every visit. 

I have tried the burgers, tacos, street corn (when in season), sonoran dog, fries, milkshakes, alcohol, and more, and I have never been disappointed. All of their ingredients taste fresh, which makes sense considering that most of them are prepared on a daily basis, including the meat for the burgers! All in all, I don't know that there's a place in a thirty mile radius to where you can get a better burger. 

Fingers crossed for a location in Gilbert soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place, the cheese burgers we ordered were to die for.   Our waitress Amanda was very nice with a great sense of humor.  She made our visit truly enjoyable.  We shall be back"}
{"text":"Super friendly new place that just opened near Harkins on Shea on Scottsdale.  Ava walked out and greeted us.  Alley was welcomed inside and we were given a menu.  Everyone was super friendly and kind to Alley.  Alley asked and was told the patio was dog friendly to all her non-service dog pals so bring everyone over and try out this new spot.  They even have vegetarian selections!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered two burgers snd fries. Burgers come with two thin patties. Fries were very good.  Burgers were ok. Sample shake they gave us was delious.  Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"The standard is a casual full service restaurant that offers reasonably priced burgers, hot dogs, milk shakes, a few tacos, hand cut fries and a few other items. The Grand Stand differs from other Burger Shops because they grind the beef in house. The burgers served here are two thin patties of beef prepared well done. The restaurant is bright an looks sort of diner-ish and they also offer patio seating too. 

A very nice young man took my order and then another (really young) nice young man delivered our orders. I ordered a standard Burger with a side order of Guacamole. I noticed my double thin patties are packed extremely loose and my sandwich is almost a loose beef sandwich. The eggy roll is also almost a loose roll because it was slightly dry and crumbled. I didn't think the beef had a lot of beef flavor but it was ok.

The fries were hand cut and were hot when we received them.

The manager and or cook also came out and checked on us and seemed very nice.

I thought the food was Five Stars compared to fast food restaurants. The quality of the food and the nice service was many steps above fast food for not much more than drive threw places. 

Overall an A-OK"}
{"text":"Oh man... how I've been looking for a burger like this one. Where it's perfect in every way, and not crazy expensive. 

The fries are \"hand cut,\" so I guess that makes them taste better. Since I haven't had fries this good in a long time either. 

A+ all the way around."}
{"text":"We have eaten at The Stand on Indian School and we enjoyed the food. This is closer to home so we thought we'd check it out. I feel like there are a lot of options for diners when it comes to hamburgers in our area. We ordered a couple of burgers and a couple different kinds of tacos; added some fries, chips and salsa, beer and a la paloma cocktail. Generally, everyone was pretty satisfied with our food. The manager was quite nice when asked by one in our party if they had margaritas. He recommended the la paloma with grapefruit juice and said he'd give her another option if she didn't like it. He was very nice and accommodating. 

The reason we gave a 3 star rating is primarily the service by wait staff and the setup for this type of food. It is a sit down restaurant where one orders at the table and food is brought out to you. For the type of food and simplistic menu we felt counter ordering would have been a better option to keep the dining bill down. We spent just under $70 with tip for a party of four and that just seems too high for a restaurant that is known for a couple burger options and street tacos.  Also, we received one small container of ketchup that was about half full when we got it and had to flag someone down to ask for another ketchup and refills for our water glasses. Maybe this is due to this location being new, but besides the manager the service was really mediocre. 

In just trying to be honest as a consumer we'd probably opt for a cheaper option like Five Guys or go up a bit to something like Hopdoddy's for more burger options."}
{"text":"I usually give 4/5 stars to restaurants... sorry to give a low score to this one.  
(We have visited the store in Arcadia and were so excited to have one off of Shea)!

We went in to buy 4 chocolate shakes last night.  The place wasn't very busy. 

When the young man started scooping out the ice cream (from the bottom of the barrel) he noticed ice crystals had formed.  He showed it to the manager and she told him to continue scooping it out \"we don't waste anything\".  She said it in front of all of us.

We starting drinking our chocolate shakes and every time we did, ice chips came through the straw.  So disappointed!  Didn't mind spending $5.00 per shake for good quality.

Worried that this location is not interested in serving top quality/fresh ingredients to the customer."}
{"text":"Great happy hour place! They were all so nice and accommodating. The have good drinks and THE BEST SLIDERS for only $2 on happy hour. If you haven't tried this place..TRY IT"}
{"text":"Could the server hate her job anymore? I drove all the way up here, what a waste of time. Close if u don't want to be here!"}
{"text":"Would rate this place 4.5 stars. Amazing outdoor ambience, clean and not too crowded.

Was here on a taco Tuesday for a date. 
Ordered - 
Vegetable tacos : they are so cooked to perfection. Really loved it. You get 3 options of salsa ranging from mild to super spicy. 
$5 Lime Margarita is good though.

Why not 5 stars?? We ordered some chips and salsa/guac which never made to my table."}
{"text":"Awesome food great concept and food quality. Placed order cheeseburger bacon jalape√±o great corn and tacos"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of the Arcadia Stand (same food) so we were excited to try the new Grande Stand. I am sad to report we were really let down by the painfully slow service on Friday night. There was no wait to be seated, however our server forgot our requests several times and we had to constantly flag down other servers to get a drink refill, our bill, etc. We even ordered a drink to go and they must not have rang it in because it never came. After requesting again and waiting so long, we just had to cut our losses and get out of there. The fries are good, the burger was the same but delivered after sitting for a while so overall I'd just stick to the Arcadia Stand..."}
{"text":"Wanted to give the new restaurant a try.  The hamburger and french fries were good.  The decor is quite plain but the killer for a new restaurant - JUST opening - is to be greeted by large pots of completely DEAD plants all around the entry.  It would be better to have EMPTY pots than ones filled with dead plants.  It was my first impression and I have to admit, unless I noticed they had cared enough to plant flowers or new plants, count me out.  A turnoff.  I am quite sure I am not the only one."}
{"text":"Enjoy this place. Locally owned and definitely cares about the customer. Got the burger and fries was very good. They also have a nice selection of local craft beers."}
{"text":"Great burger joint. If it were downtown, Camelback area or almost anywhere with easy parking, there would be a line out the door. Do yourself a favor and check this out. Great burgers, done simple plus hand cut fried and superb tacos and a full bar. Great before or after movie"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever heard of a chocolate chile milkshake up until now but omg sure glad I have because I would come back for that alone! I also got 2 veggie tacos. They are super small but taste delicious, I love veggie tacos that have quinoa. My boyfriend got a Sonoran dog and a taco, I forgot what kind. He said the taco was good but the hot dog was overpriced and the bun totally fell apart as soon as he got it. Our food took a while to arrive but not too bad. It was a little pricey for small portions, but good quality food and unique options!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and tacos and great happy hour Monday through Friday from 3 to 6. We had the chicken tacos, fries and sliders. All were excellent and only $2.5 each! Great drink specials as well. We love this place!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch. The burger and fries were very good. Expensive $15 with drink. Unfortunately they won't be around long. Location, large space, expensive fast food,tipping will doom them."}
{"text":"A few moons ago I was in Tucson with the fam and ended up at a place whose claim to fame was Sonoran hot dogs. Legend has it that it used to be a food truck or food stand that eventually grew into a brick and mortar location of significant proportions. I remember being smitten by not just the quality of the hotdogs and the huge array of condiments but also with the ambiance. 
Since that time I have been looking for a place here in Scottsdale that can rival the Sonoran hot dogs I so enjoyed in Tucson. Recently somebody suggested that I try the Grande Stande and so I did with fairly high expectations. 
I tried the Sonoran hot dog and even though it was a cut above the run of the mill hotdogs served at many places, it could not hold accandle to what I had experienced in Tucson. 
The bun was toasted (yes) but the dog was fair to middling. The condiments were average. Don't get me wrong. It was not bad but at $8.99 (sans any sides) I expected a lot more flavor and bite. 
So my hunt continues."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out because we love their Arcadia location so much and we were not disappointed! The negative reviewers need to take a chill pill and realize that this is a new restaurant trying to get their footing! Although the staff is young, they are positive and really giving effort on delivering a great experience. I recognized either a manager or owner from the Arcadia location cooking up delicious food  which only reinforces their sincere attempt on getting established. I will definitely be back because you can't beat the burgers, shakes, and stand sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time to this location. Had the Royale with cheese and happy hour beer.  Heaven. Followed by Banana shake. Heavenly again. This place better stay open cuz I want to try Salted shake next. What tacos? LOL"}
{"text":"Great value for the quality of the food. Their taco's are fantastic. A go to place for a quick reliable value meal"}
{"text":"Nice place that took over the spot where the infamous Amy's Baking used to be located.  The Grande Stand is a little fancier than The Stand in Phoenix.  This place has table service and a bar instead of ordering at the counter.

My burger, fries and chocolate shake were very good.  They weren't very busy and the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Sorry to give this only one star, you see, we went for dinner tonight at 6:30PM, there were 5 tables of people and many open tables. We were told there was a 25 minute wait. Since there were no people waiting, we asked why and were told they did not have staff available??? Too bad, really wanted to try this place but that is crazy...just my opinion.There are many other places to try."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try their homemade Horchata and left with their secret menu Horchata Milkshake! Sooo delicious! 

I'm definitely coming back for dinner now that I trust they use fresh ingredients and make their items homemade - from scratch!

Excellent!"}
{"text":"I discovered the Grande Stand and fell in love with the food and the atmosphere immediately! The food is awesome and they take great care with everything they prepare from their homemade horchata, grinding their own beef, and of course the stand sauce. Most recently we were there and Amanda took great care of us! Go check this gem out!"}
{"text":"Finally, a good place to eat has opened up in the cursed ABC location (kitchen nightmares).  The Grande Stand has fresh yummy food. My personal favorite is the veggie taco with French fries, yes French fries. Pacifico on draft and a nice touch with cucumber water.  Haven't visited the spot in Arcadia but this location is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Very uninviting restaurant, feels cold and sterile! The burger was delicious, good fries! Tacos were just ok. Super expensive, our tab was $45 without tip for 2 people. Service was fine, hopdoddy is the neighborhood favorite still..."}
{"text":"My family has dined here 3 times and probably won't be back again. The burger is good but a little overpriced considering it's not organic. Tacos are small and just okay. The decor is great but vibe is stale. Staff is friendly but manager not so much. More-so the environment than the food that will prevent us from going back but may try the Arcadia location to give it a fair shot."}
{"text":"Seriously? I thought with all the rave reviews I am sure to be walking into a burger heaven. In a sense I did - this is where burgers go to die.

Let's start with the fries, because I'm still burping them. Nasty. Too oily, some soggy some hard as a rock. Why did I even eat this crap.

 Then the burger. Nothing to write home about. Except to warn them not to come here. Thank god I added jalapenos because this thing has no plavor otherwise. Just a meh burger. Wendy's quality.

Skip this place and walk a few more steps to Hop Doddy where the burgers are priced fairly and they are actually 10 times better than this mediocre thing.

Oh, and the place was empty at prime lunch hour. I guess I'm the only one who didn't get the memo."}
{"text":"My simple review: burger is average. Fries are good. Tacos are delicious. Salted caramel shake is amazing."}
{"text":"This is a grande breath of fresh air. Wow guys! I'm pleasantly surprised by the heart and soul the owners have poured into this restaurant. It's obvious that the owners are passionate about their food, menu, service and customers. I had the Royale Burger which is the top 5 burgers I've ever had (and I've had a lot!). Wifey and I will be regulars no doubt. I love their food, location, energy but what makes them stand out is their story. Don't hesitate, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on reviews. Will not go back. Waited 1 1/2 hours for a burger. Couple near us just got up and left. Couple across from us seated after we were, finished their meal before we got ours. Waitress said the kitchen lost our order and she needed to retake it. Never asked if we wanted a refill on our drink and we stole napkins and flatware from a vacant table after our food came. Burger and fries were good but for the money and service, go somewhere else for better service and value."}
{"text":"Veggie taco was outstanding, as was the short rib taco! Tacos have two small corn tortillas, but are stuffed to the brim with filling. Get the caramel milkshake if you can, it's delish! I regret not ordering the corn because it looked so good, but I had too much on my plate already!"}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get. Two tiny tacos with dry meat, especially the al pastor. My daquiri was good tough. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Seriously had a fabulous experience here. I'm already a fan of the Stand in Arcadia so we went here to try their sit down restaurant. As usual, the best burger ever. Crispiest saltiest Fries-- you can't leave one on the plate! We wanted to try the elote but it's not in season so we got chips and salsa and guacamole platter. Pretty good for not being a \"Mexican\" restaurant. This location has full bar and tacos as well, so their menu is definitely bigger than their original location. We got burgers and fries of course with extra crispy bacon because how else would you order a burger? The owner Ron (?) came by out table and was super friendly, told us about  his signature buttermilk ranch they make. He surprised us at the end of our meal with half size servings of their salted caramel shake. OMG. If nothing else, go there for that. Actually, that's a lie. Go there for all the above. The salted caramel shake was out of this world good. You could taste the fleur de sel chunks. YUM! New fave spot for sure. Great for dinner and a movie at Harkins right next door!!"}
{"text":"Great wings and burgers. Service good. They make sure everything is spot on. Clean. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time amd will definitely be back! The people were very friendly, the restaurant was bright and clean, and the food was fun and delicious! 
I had the Sonoran Dog and my husband had the Street Tacos. Both were fresh and full of flavor! We also shared an order of deliciously crispy fries and a yummy ear of Mexican Sweet Corn!
The last thing we ordered was a Salted caramel shake, and my husband thought he'd died amd gone to heaven! (This is a guy that proclaims to not like sweets!) We drove from Mess to try this place out and it was worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger and exceptional service by Virginia.  We felt like only sharing.  Virginia was awesome to help with split order.  Great service and food."}
{"text":"I'm mostly giving the standard 5 stars because the employees were SO nice! The burger was good; comparable to in n out, the French fries were the best thing I had, the short rib taco was ok, chocolate milkshake was delicious."}
{"text":"This place has INSANELY good EVERYTHING. I love, love, love cheeseburgers and these are perfect. Fries are awesome too and THEN they have milkshakes (Salted Dulce de Leche ) that is so incredible it just doesn't seem fair. Go here. Stop what you're doing and go here.  Seriously...go..."}
{"text":"So it's Super Bowl Sunday looking for a burger to three maybe even four to take him to the game. This is the place. And even if it is Super Bowl Sunday still the place. The hamburger place in Scottsdale is this one for sure. 
We've come back only to see a AWESOME happy hr. Burger, fries or salad & beer for under $15. Love it! Thanks guys..."}
{"text":"Simple menu of burgers, hotdogs and tacos.  Shakes, sodas and beer/wine.  Super friendly, accommodating and attentive service.  Burgers and fries were good, but the banana shake was the real standout! Will be back to try the chocolate chili shake and tacos."}
{"text":"I've always liked The Stand in Arcadia so I was excited to hear that they opened up a new location on Shea. They have the same great burgers and milk shakes. I highly recommend getting the salted dulce de leche milkshake..it's worth the $5. 

Gluten free: no problem. Their fries are gluten free and they have gf buns available too."}
{"text":"This is, by far, the best burger place ever. The staff are very accommodating and the place is nice. Every time we visit, the food is delicious and very filling. My daughter also loves this place, and begs to eat there when we are in the area. The fresh cut fries are also very tasty. If you happen to pass by this place, be sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch because we were passing nearby the Shea and Scottsdale location. It's a bit tricky to find, in the back near the theater. My husband is a burger lover. We were pleased that we came on a day when the burger and fries price drops from the regular price of $11.35 to just $7.50 if you dine in on Monday between 11 am and 3 pm.  My husband asked about cheese, and they will add it at no extra charge, but you have to request it. They only offer American cheese. He also ordered a chocolate milk shake. You have to request that they make it with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup, or it will be made with chocolate ice cream. It was $5, and he liked it. Very thick. The fries were thin cut and ok. But their homemade stand sauce was delicious. It is not the typical thousand island type sauce, but kind of a ketchup, mayo, spicey sauce combo. It is both on the burger and comes with the fries, too. I don't usually care for mayo type sauces, but this was great. If they bottled it, I'd buy some to take home. The meat in the burger was good. They are reported to grind it fresh daily on site. But I can't say it was the best burger in the Valley. They needed more employees, but to be fair, they were interviewing someone on the patio while we were there. Food was handled perfectly, but we had a wait to get the check as our server was busy with other customers. That's ok. She put the most important part first.  Will we be back? Well, we ate every bite. It was good. But my husband said he will only come back if we are driving by. There are other equally good options closer to us."}
{"text":"I auctioned off 3 of my JCrew jeans while we waited to be waited on. First there was this half bald teen when we walked in who seemed to have an attitude and little to no clue what was occurring. There was this hipster guy behind the counter that might as well not even work there because he didn't know anything. Then, we got 4 of the staff workers trying to figure out how to make the shake machine work. Meanwhile, no one is seating or taking anyone's orders. In fact, half the restaurant just got up and left by the end. The food reminded me of myself, abnormally moist and has lots of grease."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos al pastor and the Sonoran Hot Dog. Today I got disappointed by the service. At the end of our meal and right after  I get my cc back, I asked to the server if we could get a refill on our two lemonades togo. She said yes and came back with only one lemonade and the bill for it. She didn't confirm prior bringing the lemonade that it would be charged again or that there are no refills on beverages.  She also managed to let us think that the fries come with the hot dog when they are actually a side that is charged on top of that.  I want to think this is the server behavior and not the restaurant. I've been there a couple times before right when they opened the people was great and food is limited but really good  but this time either the server is tricky or the restaurant is not paying attention to their customers."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing at this the whole week and decided to visit this Saturday with the whole family.  I had my expectations up because the pictures looked crazy good! Thank goodness it didnt disappoint! You gotta try The Royale and I suggest you do it when you're starving coz it's really HUGE! It has guacamole in there, it's crazy good! We also ordered the Sonoran Hotdog which is full of goodness and Beef Taco, and the chocolate shake and  just to jive with the theme, the Mexican Coke. Our waitress Christen is such a doll and very attentive. You can imagine how stuffed this family of three were when we got out.  #lfthx

{"text":"My husband the Burger lover, said \" Give em a 2\". 
The staff and service were awesome.
But the food was nothing special.
Thrillist said it was one of the best burgers in the US. We could not disagree more. Meh really does describe the burger taste. Not a bad taste, just not tasty or worth the $$.
Other options:
Fries tasted ok
Chicken taco was no good except for the pickled onions.
Mexican corn on the cob was the best tasting thing on the menu.
My husband said the vanilla shake was good."}
{"text":"Voted one of the best burgers in the nation! The tacos are also excellent as are their shakes! Owner is a cool dude!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the food and concept is good... could have been a great experience if the service was better!
Sunday around four after ASU win yeah!
It seemed to be a shift change but whatever the case the attitude and atmosphere was not pleasant. 
A cute couple walk by us on the way out and even commented how terrible the service was. They witness us move from the table in the back to the counter hoping for better service. It's a shame that these places have great food but put people in charge that really don't care and gives their business a bad name!
Another great concept bites the dust!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burgers around. If you make it in during happy hour the sliders and wings are a MUST. Love this place and it's run by great people. Ron has been in the game a long time and knows how to take care of you. This is the kind of spot you drive out of your way to go to."}
{"text":"We loved this place. Some mixed reviews on Yelp and Nextdoor, and the place was nearly empty at 6pm on Friday, but it was delish!!! And we had terrific service! My husband loved his double cheeseburger, my 5yo ate nearly all of her 2 taco kids meal and I ate every bit of my wedge salad and street corn. We also missed happy hour by 1 min but our server still gave us 3 HH drinks at HH price. We want to make this a regular spot now and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Just... wow! My boyfriend and I came in for lunch last week and we were so surprised! I work in the complex and had tried their food from generous samples provided to me and my coworkers from the owner. I told my boyfriend how good their food is, and us being chefs, we had to come check out the place. The place was unusually quiet when we came in, understandable enough for a new business. We were the only ones seated. The waitress we had was very friendly and talked to us about the business and how it started out etc. my boyfriend ordered the Standard burger with cheese as well as a short rib taco. He loved the seasoning on the short rib, but said he preferred the burger, loving the Stand Sauce. I, on the other hand, was picky. I ordered the Royal burger with no cheese or stand sauce. My order initially came out wrong, having cheese on it, but the fixed it instantly. Our server was quick and friendly about the whole ordeal. My meal was outstanding. And as funny as it sounds, my favorite part about it were the fries!! I don't know what they are seasoned with, but they are out of this world. I would go back just for the fries! Will most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem! Everything here is made by hand! They mentioned they grind their own beef for their burgers. We got the French fries and chips and guacamole since we were killing time before our movie. I ordered the French fries which were amazing! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Since we were here for happy hour too- I got them for a steal! They gave you a lot. My boyfriend got the chips and guacamole and the chips were handmade and so fresh! The guacamole too was made by hand. The waitress offered us salsa and we didn't ask if there was a charge and there wasn't. It was good as well! Each serving was more than enough for two people. In fact I would say if you are light eater just order the one or the other. We would definitely come back here to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised for stumbling on this place!  The eight of us had a fantastic meal with great service!  Among our orders, there were hot dog with fixing, tacos of chicken, short rib and pork.  Also had 3 sides of Mexican street corn and fries.  Every thing was delicious!  I mean every thing was delicious!  Great food, very friendly service that we will definitely return in the future.  

Grande Stand is located by Harkins Shea 14, great place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Put down what you are doing right now and drive yourself to The Grande Stand. Ryan and I each have a running list of the 5 best burgers of our lives. Ryan's fluctuates every so often. But mine never changes. Until today. 

They grind their meat every day at Grande Stand. That makes such a difference! The cheese is so thick and in perfect ratio and harmony to the party. It's like next level In & Out and Shake Shack. The fries are hand cut each day and reminded me of \"The Great Steak and Fry Co.\" The Shake was so thick, the blender was really working to blend it up. I asked for a chocolate shake and boy, did I get one! 

Quentin is exactly who you would want behind the counter. He was friendly, approachable and completely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu. 

So the Royale or the standard? First off, you must add buttered, grilled onions to your Standard burger order. It makes the burger. Secondly, I added bacon to my standard burger. It was delicious and rich. But to switch things up, you could skip bacon and just enjoy the meaty goodness in the burger. 

Ryan got the Royale and man, is it fit for a king! Guacamole, bacon, grilled onions, a double patty on a brioche bun to stand up to all of those additional add ons! 

The street corn is actually what brought us in. Man! It was incredible. The flavors are spot on. I took it back with us for a late night snack! 

As I mentioned, don't miss out on the opportunity for fries and a shake. It's worth the calories. Sometimes you have to live a little and as my friend Dave says, \"if you are going to be a bear, be a grizzly.\" I think that about sums up this place. It's a grizzly bear's dream. Coming back later this week for tacos and cocktails! Can't wait. 

Thank you Quentin and thank you The Grande Stand for one of the top 5 burgers of my life!"}
{"text":"The Grande Stand is excellent! I ordered the Standard and it was probably the best hamburger that I have had in Scottsdale. Tip - you are able to order a single patty standard if you do not want two patty on your burger. The french fries were delicious and fried to perfection. You will have to be sure to save room for one of their milkshakes. The chocolate milkshake is great way to take the fullness away. The only thing I did not like was that you did not have an option to only buy a hamburger you must buy the entire meal."}
{"text":"This place was a total disappoint.  I never give bad review.  But I got up and left.  First not greeted when we came in....give the happy hour menu  (no happy hour on Saturday), then waiting 5 minutes for correct menu and drink a water and tea, then watched female waitress swip her nose several times while delivering food and before giving us a menu.  Keep in mind looked like 3 servers  were worling,and we were only one without food.  After 10 minutes we paid for tea and left."}
{"text":"I thought the food was really tasty. The chicken and al pastor tacos had great flavor. They are small, but reasonably priced. The guacamole was pretty good too. The service is average which is why I gave it a 4. I agree with a previous reviewer that it wouldn't be better as an order at the counter joint, but that's okay. My family was satisfied. We didn't have a shake because The Baked Bear is just down the way. I wouldn't definitely go back here to eat and try the burger. PS My kids said their burgers were good."}
{"text":"It's OPEN!!!
We drove 30 miles from Gilbert and it's wonderful.
Well worth the trip. Loved the hot dogs and tacos. Service was excellent too"}
{"text":"It's nice to go to a restaurant where the staff seems anxious to please and appears to really care if you are enjoying your meal.  A+ for that, Grande Stand.  But unfortunately that's all that you do really well.  The \"star\" hamburger is just not tasty.  Yes, the beef has the consistency of fresh ground, but did you run out of salt and pepper?  The bun is weak, and the other fixings average.  Even with the mountain of super hot fries, $13 is not a great value (same price for a Sonora dog - wow!).   

Between 6 and 6:30 pm on an in-season Thursday, Grande Stand was devoid of other customers.  I think if they are to stay open, they must decide what they want to be: a quick stop for a meal before the movies (then lower your prices) or a premium burger place (then increase your offerings and get a much better bun and invest in some spices).  

Like other Yelpers, I truly wish you good luck."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in the area!  Have been to both locations and they never disappoint.  On a recent visit our order was slightly messed up.  It was nothing big, and the staff was very quick to correct the mistake, the owner apologized and gave us some free milkshakes.  Got to try the Salted Dulce De Leche milkshake and it is amazing!  We will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, great service, and a great environment!  I had the \"Royal w cheese\", chicken taco, elote corn on the cobb, and salted caramel shake.  Everything was dynamite!  Burger was huge and all the fixings were spot on, the corn was the best I've ever had, the chicken taco was perfect, and the shake was ridiculous!!  Plus, I got to watch the sporting event (NBA playoffs) while being served all my food and drinks!  The place was very clean and organized. I was greeted nice and sent away with a authentic thank u!  Jeeze, this place rocks!  Great job to the staff and owner! Thank you for coming to the hood!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I love the Stand.  What's better than the Stand in my opinion?  The Version that's in my hood!  Woot!

Best burgers out there, hands down.  You also pay the price for them here too.

So walking in, it's decorated fun and very hip.  Table service at this location.  We sat, service was prompt.  Ordered burgers for the boys, a short rib taco, side salad, and chips with guacamole.  All were soooo good.  Stand sauce is amazing with fries.

The only downside to this location is that there is a high price tag compared to the Cen-Pho location.  But in this case you truly get what you pay for...  #winning"}
{"text":"We went to the Grande Stand today, and it was awesome!  Ron and Katelyn provided us with exceptional service. Their burger was very tasty, and the hand cut fries are to die for!
The tacos were delicious too! Very impressive!
Katlyn was an exceptional host, making our dinner very enjoyable. We will be recommending the Stand to all of our friends here in Phoenix. We are looking forward to our next visit!
Thank you.

{"text":"Popped in on a Thursday around 11:20am for lunch, the place had several tables with patrons but overall wasn't too crowded or crazy. The two of us got a table and were informed that they were having some staffing issues, as they only had one server until noon so she was running around and really working hard to get everyone taken care of. Anyone who came in after us was informed that it would be a few minutes due to the situation. The one server and other woman presumably from the back trying to help her were really nice and totally keeping their cool in a stressful situation. I give them major props. 

Food wise I had heard that they had great burgers, so we both ordered the standard. Double Burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and special sauce. They both came with a side of fries, and before our food came out a side of ketchup and special/fry sauce were brought to the table. That special sauce was AMAZING. I was loading each fry up with it, I couldn't get enough.

The burger itself was delicious too, the toppings tasted fresh and weren't skimpy little pieces of veggies. I think more of the special sauce was on the burger too and it was amazing. I could barely finish my burger and believe me.. I can eat!

The atmosphere is pretty cute, it's bright inside and they have indoor and outdoor seating. It's nothing super fancy or decorated but it works for the space and the menu. 

Even with the staffing issues, we were in and out in under an hour. Again, I give the server props, she was giving it her best effort and we were still asked about refills and got our food and check in a timely manner. I will definitely return to try the tacos and get the burger again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are huge fans of the Stand. First, everyone who works there is incredibly nice. It's also a cute place, very clean. And then the food... Their burgers are one of my favorites in The Valley. They do two thin patties with a nice char on the outside. Fries with potato skins (always good), and the piece de resistance: the dulce de leche milkshake. It's heavenly!! If you haven't been, definitely try it out."}
{"text":"First time eating here and we all loved the place. The fries were awesome. The banana shake is to die for and hands down the best shake I have ever had.  The burger was delicious and the Standard burger comes with two nicely sized patties. The service was very attentive and they offered everyone a free sample of their peach lemonade, which was very good but a little too sweet for my liking. Definitely will be coming back to this restaraunt."}
{"text":"Another great night at the Stand!  Ron and his team were the best and the food was amazing! If you haven't been here....you're missing out!  Best in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"This place definitely offers a solid burger, but it does not live up to the hype of being awarded the best burger in town. Atmosphere is nice and the restaurant is in a good location. Staff is very friendly and responsive. The price for the hot dog, though, is crazy even for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's actually called The Grande Stand. The Standard is the name of their standard burger.
Super friendly staff. Place is clean bright and, thanks to staff, cheery. Got a couple of cheese burgers, fries and the All American dog to go.  One order of fries was all we needed for the two burgers and they were 1/8\" natural fries cooked perfectly. Burgers come with 2 patties of meat lettuce tomatoes and onions with their special mayo based sauce that is a little spicy. Everyone enjoyed their meal very much. My 12 year old devoured his before me!
It's worth going back for the food and super friendly service!  Perfect for fairly quick meal, a beer and movie."}
{"text":"Finally tried it and this place is legit! All gluten free and really good. Dulce de Leche shake is the best thing I've ever had. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Service here was some of the worst I've ever had in a restaurant. I ordered the Royale and it came without cheese. Waited for the server to fix it but she never came back. Finally after I was almost done we flagged her down to explain they forgot the cheese. She said that was extra. But the menu clearly states it comes with cheese on the Royale. Everything listed in the description was on there but no cheese. The chocolate shake I ordered finally came after our food was done. It was so thick the straw they gave me was worthless. I'm no shake expert but I'm pretty sure you're supposed to blend up the ice cream before placing it in the cup. Otherwise it's just ice cream in a cup. Finally, we sat for about 20-30 minutes after finishing our meal before we had to once again flag someone down to ask for our check. Pretty sure our waitress quit or something. Terrible service. Food was ok but not worth the hassle. Way overpriced too. I'll stick to Shake Shack."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times, once for take out and twice I dined in. Each time has been fantastic. The food is delicious from the burgers to the tacos(still need to try the hot dog)! My favorites are probably the short rib tacos and the al pastor. Staff is incredibly friendly and the owner makes sure everything is going well. Great beer selection on tap! This is a very welcomed addition to the neighborhood. 

So I've probably been here 20 times and it is always amazing. I've eaten everything except the hotdogs on the menu and everything is absolutely fantastic. I'm obsessed with the sliders(only available during happy hour) so I can't get away from them. Do yourself a favor and try this place!!! Service and food consistently amazing."}
{"text":"When you're craving a burger, I suggest you go to The Grande Stand in Scottsdale. Seriously, the burgers are so good. Like I don't understand what they do, but SO good. Plus, the hand-cut french fries and the fresh lemonade made for a perfect meal. I was also eyeing the Mexican street corn and banana stand shake, so clearly I need to go back stat. My friend loved her tacos on taco Tuesday and the salted dulce de leche shake as well. Also, the staff was super friendly, my friend and I were busy taking some photos of the food and chatting before we started eating our meal. Since we were taking our time, they came over to us and asked if they could bring us a new fresh meal so we can enjoy it warm. We did not take them up on this offer, but the fact that they asked blew our mind!"}
{"text":"The hype is real. Good fast service. The decor was laid back. The burger was what you crave. Juicy crispy beefy goodness in on a good bread. I really enjoyed the French fries. As thin fries I feared they may be too crispy and dry but they are the near perfect potato fry you could ask for."}
{"text":"The Sonoran Dog, Fries and Iced Tea were great tasting.  Best dog I'v had.  The service was warm and friendly, and the Waitress gave me an ice tea to go.  Good on a 106F day.  The only con was price. With tip the dog, fries, and tea set me back $19+.  Would have been 5 stars at $12-$13.
At this price point I might make it in 1 or 2 times a year, which is a shame cause the food and service were really great.  Sorry guy's, I'm retired and fixed income, and this is beyond my budget."}
