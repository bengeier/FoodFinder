{"text":"Great food ...Great service. .. just what we need in this area! The pizza is authentic and always delicious.... the restuarant is family friendly and clean."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but the rest of the food is not.  Customer service is definitely not important to them.  Unfortunately the former pizza place that was at this location ran themselves out of business because of their terrible customer service and unfortunately I predict the same thing happening for Anzi."}
{"text":"This will be out of business in no time...called for delivery and one pizza wasn't enough when I live two miles away...very rude"}
{"text":"Over priced, bad service, and bad food.

I ordered a regular pizza with fresh tomatoes, pineapple, onions and mushrooms and Sicilian pizza.  The order was more than $50.  For that much money, I expect good pizza.  What I got was a soggy under cooked mess.  After the first bite that tasted like dough - I called Anzi's too  get it fixed.  The man with whom I spoke was the one who made the pizza and he argued with me.  He told me that the toppings I chose were watery.  If they can't make a veggie pizza that isn't soggy - then why didn't they tell me that when I first ordered?  He continued to argue with me - it was my fault.  He offered to send me something else but told me if I ordered the same thing - it would be burned.  Seriously?  They can't cook a non-soggy veggie pizza?  The Sicilian wasn't anything special.  If there was a way to give no stars, then I would.  

I can't imagine that they will stay in business at this location very long with such bad service and food."}
{"text":"So we've ordered from here 3 times. I'm sorry to say 3rd time was not the charm. Chicken Parm dinner, no taste. Bland. Second time, asked for calamari to be crispy, it was hardly cooked. 3rd time ordering asked for two chicken heroes with fried chicken. Person who took order repeated everything correctly but both sandwiches came grilled. We gave them 3 chances. Not ordering from them any longer. In my opinion, they are not as good as the old Anzi's that was on Rea Road. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"VERY disappointed  -  I was excited to see a closer location. Enjoyed them years ago...  Ordered 4 different items: Stromboli, slice stuffed pizza, chicken alfredo & mozzarella sticks = all were tasteless. adding oregano to the top of each is not seasoning. Crust was chewy, cheese sticks had a lot of breading, not much cheese!  I want a REFUND. $39.00 in the trash.  Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Very good food for the most part. The pizza is good. Very busy on a Friday night and Saturday. Lots of take out."}
{"text":"Love their food and prices. Ordered a Shrimp Parmigana dinner - super price. Ditto for a meatball pizza at another time!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the reviews are so low for Anzi. Maybe from past management. This is a great family friendly restaurant with authentic Italian cuisine. They deliver within 6 miles and do catering parties. The pizza is New York style. Prices are very reasonable and they give large portions. You get your money's worth and the food is very good. Very friendly and helpful staff as well! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here for lunch with my daughter. We each got a slice, and shared garlic knots and a soda. I spent $14+. $2.50 for a cheese slice, plus $.75 per topping per slice FEELS a little more expensive than normal, but I dont buy too many slices. I feel like most places only charge $1.50 or so for ENTIRE PIZZA toppings. 

Anyway.... I was happy that they allowed refills on the fountain soda. We did take them up on that offer. The employees were nice, so there are no complaints there. The place was clean too. 

Ok, so the pizza was ok. It's NY style. When I was there, it looked like the pizza had been sitting for hours, but it turned out ok. The garlic knots were ok too, but pretty greasy. Seems I have a lot of trouble finding a place with really good garlic knots around here, so for that reason, these are acceptable. 

Anyway, this is a small place with decent food. Maybe a little more expensive than some others, but its fine for a drop in spot."}
{"text":"Chicken parm is outstanding.  Tender juicy chicken, generous portion on top of a heaping serving of pasta al dente.  Sauce is not overly spicy so I usually add a little garlic and red pepper flakes... Jut how I like it.  Service is fast and friendly... I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"It is nothing to write home about. The sauce on the pizza was bland, the menu outdated, but the real issue I had with them tonight was the lady who took our order.  Ordered a pizza and a calzone and the calzone was delivered to our table but not the pizza. When I inquired about the delay in the pizza she said they had gotten a large number of to go orders (although we saw no one come in and pick up while we were there)  Clearly, it was a lie because she went over to the pizza oven looking for our pizza when she saw the calzone delivered to the table without the pizza. If you lost the order, the least you could do is just admit it and perhaps I could understand. It happens!! But to straight out lie to my face is unacceptable. I will never visit this establishment again.  They could certainly use a class in customer service."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting straight out of Sicily but how hard could it be to make a pizza and some salad? So I gave these guys a chance to make it, and just to be gently, left a lot to be desired and frankly just let me down on what I was expecting. The pics looked good online but the reality was not good at all. It seemed like it was rushed. Maybe another 3-5 minutes in the oven could have saved it."}
{"text":"New owners super friendly who are looking to please customer. All I tried so far was the pizza ,it had a great crust and very good sauce. I will be back to try other options"}
{"text":"3 stars for solid pizza, solid service in a very casual, friendly environment. They'd get 4 stars if the pizza was a bit more like New Haven, CT style. It was good, better than Lorenzo's."}
{"text":"Pizza was good and fast.  eggplant parmesan good.  sauce nice and sweet."}
{"text":"Went to Anzi yesterday with 4 people for lunch and the food was great. I had the chicken parm hero, wife had a grilled chicken avocado wrap, bro in law anzi combo hero and son had pasta... all came out great at reasonable price and free drinks included. I recommend..."}
{"text":"Anzi Pizzeria is owned and operated by the folks once owned the former Anzi's Pizza and Pasta in the Stonecrest Shopping Center.  I understand they opened 4 Anzi's Pizza and Pasta restaurants in NC and sold them all.  The original owners have now opened a restaurant in The Fountains of Charlotte shopping center complex located at the intersection of Tom Short and Ardrey Kell in South Charlotte.  

The Fountains of Charlotte is a conglomeration of like 5 strip malls in one place and they have a few dozen shops and restaurants.  Anzi is a little difficult to find the first time.  It's near newly opened La Catrina Mexican Grill, and OnStage.

We stopped in for a pizza.  We ordered a large 18\" 4-topping hand-tossed pizza with thinly sliced meatballs (love them), eggplant parmesan, fresh mushrooms and spinach. My wife and I filled up on half a pizza (2 large slices each) and took the rest home to enjoy another day.

The folks that will enjoy Anzi most are the customers (like us) that enjoyed them at the Stonecrest location.  It was a nice surprise to find they had returned to South Charlotte."}
{"text":"Pizza is good especially the Sicilian pizza but I loved the eggplant parm sandwich - will definitely order that again. Oh and the penne ala vodka is good as well!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Calzone from this place and it was ROCK HARD. Then a co-worker pointed out to me that its because its pre-made. Gross!! The only good thing about this place is their soda."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit divey with a definite slant for the take-out customer.  Hard core, old-school Sicilians are behind the counter, so when you approach to order, frankly, you're thinking you're in for some kick-ass pizza.

Meh...

The meatballs were raquet ball sized but unfortunately, that was their best quality.  They had that, I've been in the food processor too long and then sat in the fridge overnight for a few nights before being thrown into a pot of sauce before serving feel to them.  My boys ate them, but my 2 boys weigh a combined 50 pounds and eat close for 4000 calories a day.  Each.  So they'll eat a month old meatball they found on the playground and love it.  

Our 'roni and mushroom pizza was thicker than a typical NY style pizza, but it was definitely still trying to be a NY style pizza.  TONS of cheese on it, to the point where it was kinda gross.  Greasy, but that's not a bad thing necessarily.  The mushrooms were pretty black, indicating a lack of freshness.  The crust was tasty I spose, but nothing to write home about, and frankly was a little too fluffy for me.  

It wasn't authentic.  It didn't meet expectations.  And frankly, while we sat in the restaurant, nobody cared that we were there, so the service was non-existant.

For me, this is a niche place you're either all-in on, or for the rest of us, can simply pass up without missing a beat."}
